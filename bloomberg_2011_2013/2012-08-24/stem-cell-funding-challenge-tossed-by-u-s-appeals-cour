A lawsuit challenging U.S. funding
for human embryonic stem-cell research was rejected by a federal
appeals court in Washington, which upheld a lower court’s ruling
dismissing the case.  A three judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington today said that U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth
“committed no error” when he threw out the lawsuit filed by
 James Sherley , a researcher at Boston Biomedical Research
Institute, and Theresa Deisher, founder of AVM Biotechnology in
Seattle. Lamberth, in his July 2011 dismissal ruling, cited an
earlier appeals court finding that the government-backed
research is probably lawful.  The two doctors sought to block the U.S. Health and Human
Services Department and the  National Institutes of Health  from
spending federal funds on research involving human embryonic
 stem cells , arguing it violates a law known as the Dickey-Wicker
Amendment.  The 1996 statute bars government spending on research that
damages or destroys a human embryo. In a 2-1 decision in April
2011, the appeals court let the funding continue while Lamberth
considered a final ruling. The appellate panel said the language
of the statute wouldn’t support a funding cutoff.  The case is Sherley v. Sebelius, 11-5241,  U.S. Court of
Appeals  for the District of Columbia Circuit (Washington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
