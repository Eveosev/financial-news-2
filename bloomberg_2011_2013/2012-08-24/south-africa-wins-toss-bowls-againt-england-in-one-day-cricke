South Africa won the toss and
decided to bowl against England in the first one-day cricket
international in Cardiff. The start of the match has been
delayed by rain.  England recalled Chris Woakes to the team in place of
 Stuart Broad , who is being rested.  Dale Steyn  is being rested by
South Africa, replaced by Wayne Parnell.  South Africa will leapfrog England into the No. 1 spot in
the International Cricket Council one-day rankings with a win
today. The Proteas have already replaced England atop the Test
rankings with a 2-0 series win.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
