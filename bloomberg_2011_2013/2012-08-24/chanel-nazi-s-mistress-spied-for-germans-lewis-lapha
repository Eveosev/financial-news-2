Coco Chanel  liked being cosseted by
high-born rich men, who helped her rise in business and society.
When Hitler marched into France, Chanel took a German lover.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Baron Hans Gunther von Dincklage was a charming, handsome
man, who became the last great love of Chanel’s life. He was
also a spymaster reporting directly to Goebbels.  As the French starved and suffered, Chanel and Dincklage
lived the high life, residing in the Hotel Ritz, going to
Maxim’s, eating pheasant and drinking  Chateau Latour .  During their affair, the baron recruited her for German
military intelligence. In 1941, the Abwehr enrolled Chanel as
Agent F-7124, code name Westminster (after her ex-lover, the
Duke of Westminster), and began sending her on missions.  After the liberation of Paris, Chanel was brought in for
questioning about her collaboration with the enemy. She was
allowed to go home, saved by the intervention of an old friend.
“Churchill had me freed,” she said.  I spoke with Hal Vaughan, author of “Sleeping With the
Enemy: Coco Chanel’s Secret War,” on the following topics:  1. Virulent Anti-Semite  2. Chic Courtesan  3. Nazi Mistress  4. Spying for Germans  5. Postwar Success  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
