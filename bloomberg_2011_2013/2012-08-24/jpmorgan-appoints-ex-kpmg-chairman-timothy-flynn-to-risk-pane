JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s board of
directors assigned former KPMG International Chairman Timothy Flynn to its risk committee after an internal probe blamed lax
controls for a $5.8 billion trading loss in London.  Flynn, who retired from the accounting firm in October and
was elected to JPMorgan’s board in May, joined the risk panel in
July, said  Joe Evangelisti , a spokesman for New York-based
lender. JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
56, is the largest bank in the U.S. by assets.  The risk committee came under scrutiny after the trading
loss became public May 10, when it was estimated at $2 billion.
JPMorgan blamed large and illiquid trades at the chief
investment office that couldn’t be unwound without disrupting
markets. The risk panel’s three members included only one with
Wall Street experience, James Crown, and he hadn’t been employed
in the industry for more than 25 years.  The other  members  included Ellen Futter, 62, president of
the American Museum of Natural History, who sat on  American
International Group Inc. (AIG) ’s governance committee in 2008, and
 David Cote , 60, chief executive officer of  Honeywell
International Inc. (HON)  The Financial Times reported in May that
Futter was expected to step down from the panel.  Flynn, whose age was listed as 55 in a March  news release ,
led KPMG International from 2007 until he retired in October,
according to the bank. “He has extensive experience in
financial services and risk management from 32 years with KPMG
and its predecessors,” the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
