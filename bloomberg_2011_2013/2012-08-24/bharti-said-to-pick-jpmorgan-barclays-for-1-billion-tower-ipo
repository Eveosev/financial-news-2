Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , India’s largest
telephone company, picked eight banks including JPMorgan Chase &
Co. and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  to manage an initial share sale of its
towers unit, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  Bharti Airtel, based in  New Delhi , may sell shares in
Bharti Infratel Ltd. in the first quarter of 2013, the people
said, asking not to be identified as the details are
confidential.  The IPO could raise about $1 billion, the people said,
making it the largest in India since state-owned  Coal India
Ltd. (COAL) ’s $3.5 billion sale in October 2010. IPO fundraising in the
country has tumbled this year as the economy slowed, with just
$303 million of deals completed, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Bharti, which had named Standard Chartered last year to
help it tap the markets, also mandated Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, Enam Securities Pvt., HSBC Holdings Plc, Kotak Mahindra
Capital Co. and UBS AG this week for the sale, the people said.  Bharti Airtel in December 2007 agreed to sell a $1 billion
stake in the towers unit to investors including Temasek Holdings
Pte, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. Two months
later, Bharti Infratel said KKR & Co., the leveraged- buyout
firm led by Henry Kravis and  George Roberts , agreed to invest
$250 million in a deal that valued the company at $12.5 billion.  Bharti Airtel spokesman Raza Khan declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
