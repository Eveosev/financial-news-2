Japanese  shares  declined, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average falling the most since July 25, after
U.S. unemployment claims rose more than expected and concern
intensified that European leaders are making little progress on
the debt crisis.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a carmaker that counts  North America  as
its biggest market, slid 1.5 percent. Ricoh Co., an office-
equipment company that gets more than a fifth of its revenue in
Europe, sank 2.5 percent. Steelmakers declined after the U.S.
sector was downgraded by Dahlman Rose & Co. on speculation
prices may have peaked. Osaka Securities Exchange Co. plunged 16
percent after  Tokyo  Stock Exchange Group Inc.’s tender offer for
its rival succeeded.  The U.S. jobless data “reignited investor concern about
the economic future,” said Kenichi Kubo, a senior  fund manager 
at Tokio Marine Asset Management Co., which oversees about 5.6
trillion yen ($71 billion). “It’s the most reliable data I look
at as its correlation with economic conditions and share
movements are consistently high.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  fell 1.2 percent to 9,070.76 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, declining 1 percent on the week. Volume on the
gauge was almost 30 percent below the 30-day average. The
broader  Topix (TPX)  Index lost 1 percent to 757.23, with almost three
times as many shares declining as advancing.  The Topix has fallen 13 percent from this year’s peak on
March 27 on concern earnings will be hurt by Europe’s debt
crisis and slowing growth in China and the U.S. The decline has
cut the price of shares on the gauge to 0.9 times book value,
compared with 2.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.4
for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number less than one means
companies can be bought for less than the value of their assets.  U.S. Employment  Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.1 percent today. The gauge
slid 0.8 percent yesterday, the biggest drop in a month after a
report showed the number of applications for  unemployment
benefits  climbed last week to a one-month high. Jobless claims
rose for a second week to 372,000, exceeding the 365,000 median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Nissan, which gets almost a third of its revenue from North
America, fell 1.5 percent to 765 yen. OKK Corp., a machine-tools
maker that gets almost 25 percent of its sales from the U.S.,
slipped 2 percent to 96 yen.  Exporters to Europe also declined after German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  said Europe is in one of its deepest crises, while
the country’s finance minister,  Wolfgang Schaeuble , said
allowing  Greece  more time to meet its debt obligations would not
solve the country’s problems.  Ricoh lost 2.5 percent to 625 yen. Roland Corp., a maker of
electronic musical instruments that gets a third of its sales
from Europe, sank 3.5 percent to 608 yen.  Bourse Merger  Osaka Securities Exchange tumbled by its daily limit of
70,000 yen to 367,500 yen, the biggest drop since at least April
2004. The Tokyo Stock Exchange yesterday said it received more
than the maximum number of shares sought in a tender for its
rival. UBS AG cut the stock’s target price to 300,000 yen from
390,000 yen, saying profitability will be lower after the merger
with the Tokyo bourse.  Steelmakers declined after Dahlman Rose analyst Anthony
Rizzuto downgraded steel producers in the U.S., saying recent
price increases aren’t matched internationally.  Iron ore  with 62
percent iron content delivered to the Chinese port of Tianjin
sank 4.9 percent to $99.60 a  dry ton  yesterday, falling below
$100 for the first time since 2009, according to a gauge
compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  Nippon Steel Corp., Japan’s largest steelmaker, fell 1.2
percent to 172 yen. JFE Holdings Inc. sank 3.5 percent to 1,072
yen.  Utilities gained  the most  among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups. The shares rose after  Kansai Electric  Power Co. was
raised to buy at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on prospects for hikes
in power rates. Kansai Electric jumped 5.8 percent to 697 yen,
the largest gainer on the Nikkei 225. Chubu Electric Power Co.
climbed 2.5 percent to 1,036 yen.  -- With assistance from Adam Haigh in Sydney. Editors:  Jim Powell , Jason Clenfield  To contact the reporter on this story:
