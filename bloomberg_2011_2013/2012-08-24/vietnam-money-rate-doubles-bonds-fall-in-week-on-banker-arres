Vietnam’s  overnight  money-market
rate more than doubled this week as banks hoarded cash to meet
customer withdrawals after the co-founder of  Asia Commercial (ACB) 
Bank was arrested.  Government bonds  and the dong fell.  The overnight interbank deposit rate surged 4.1 percentage
points since Aug. 17 to 6.80 percent, the highest level in more
than four months and the biggest weekly climb since Bloomberg
started compiling the data in 2009. The yield on benchmark five-
year bonds jumped 21 basis points, or 0.21 percentage point, to
9.82 percent this week, according to a daily fixing rate from
banks compiled by Bloomberg. The yield rose 12 basis points
today to the highest level since July 30.  Nguyen Duc Kien, a co-founder of Vietnam’s fourth-biggest
lender by market value, was arrested Aug. 20 for allegedly
conducting “business illegally,” according to a central bank
statement. Asia Commercial will withdraw 36 trillion dong ($1.7
billion) from the  interbank market  to meet its liabilities,
Deputy Chief Executive Officer Nguyen Thanh Toai said yesterday.  “The rate in the money market is right up and that’s why
investors have hesitated to put money into the  bond market ,”
said Pham Phuong Lan, the Hanoi-based head of fixed-income and
currency trading at the Bank for Investment & Development of
Vietnam.  The dong traded at 20,875 per dollar as of 3:28 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,725 yesterday and 20,845 a week ago,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of
Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec.
26, according to its website. The currency is allowed to trade
up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
