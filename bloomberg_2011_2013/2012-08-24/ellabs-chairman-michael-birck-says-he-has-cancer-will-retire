Tellabs Inc. (TLAB)  co-founder and Chairman
Michael J. Birck said he was recently diagnosed with leukemia
and will not seek re-election to the company’s board.  Birck is the second Tellabs executive to be diagnosed with
cancer this year. Rob Pullen, then Tellabs’ chief executive
officer, said in April that he had started treatment for  colon
cancer . He died at age 50 last month.  “This year has been particularly difficult,” Birck said
today in a statement. Birck has started chemotherapy for chronic
myelomonocytic leukemia, which he said is a treatable but not
curable form of the bone marrow disease.  Birck, who has been with Tellabs for more than 35 years,
said he feels good and will continue to work. “I will be
actively engaged with our board and our talented management
team,” he said. Birck plans to retire from Tellabs next spring
after the board meeting.  Birck, a former employee at AT&T’s Bell Telephone
Laboratories, helped start Tellabs in the 1970s. The Naperville,
Illinois-based company makes telephone-system equipment for
carriers such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
