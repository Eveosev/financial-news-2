The European Commission may publish
measures on Sept. 11 to transform supervision of banks in the
euro area as part of a push to break the currency region’s debt
crisis.  The plans would hand supervisory powers to the  European
Central Bank  in an effort to have “common and more integrated”
regulation of lenders, the Brussels-based commission said in a
statement on  its website  today. The measures should take effect
“early in 2013,” it said.  The publication date of the plans may still change, the
commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
