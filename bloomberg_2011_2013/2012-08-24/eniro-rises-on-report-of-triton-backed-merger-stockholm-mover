Eniro AB (ENRO) ,  Sweden ’s biggest yellow-
pages publisher, rose the most in six weeks after Dagens
Industri reported that Triton Advisers Ltd. may pursue a merger
between European Directories BV and the Swedish company.  Eniro rose as much as 12 percent and was up 6.9 percent to
10.10 kronor as of 10:12 in Stockholm, giving the company a
market value of 1 billion kronor ($151 million).  Triton has acquired about 30 percent of European
Directories’ debt, according to Dagens Industri, and has made a
concrete offer to other bondholders that would give it close to
full control over the company. Once that deal is complete, a
merger with competitor Eniro would be the next step, the
newspaper said, citing sources following the process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
