Kenya’s shilling fluctuated against
the dollar as the Central Bank of Kenya sought to meet demand
through  repurchase agreements .  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy was less than
0.1 percent stronger at 83.95 a dollar by 4:36 p.m. in Nairobi,
the capital, having earlier weakened 0.1 percent. The currency
has advanced 0.3 percent this month.  The shilling is “expected to be supported in coming days
by central bank liquidity mop-ups,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) 
said today in an e-mailed note to clients.  The central bank accepted 8.01 billion shillings ($95.3
million) today via repurchase agreements, after it received bids
worth 9.84 billion shillings for the 8 billion shillings it had
offered, a central bank official who asked not be named in line
with policy said by phone.  The Tanzanian shilling was trading 0.1 percent stronger at
1,569 a dollar, while  Uganda ’s shilling gained 0.4 percent to
2,520 versus the U.S. currency, snapping two days of decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
