Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili’s ruling party has a lead of more than 20 percentage
points over billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s opposition
movement before October elections, according to a poll.  Fifty-five percent of likely voters back the United
National Movement compared with 33 percent for Georgian Dream,
according to the poll by Washington-based research firm
Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, seen by  Bloomberg News  today.  The survey also showed that 69 percent of Georgians expect
the October election will be “free and fair.”  The poll of 1,500 people was conducted between Aug. 1 and
Aug. 6 and was funded by the United National Movement. It has
margin of error of 3.7 percentage points. Maya Panjikidze, a
spokeswoman for Ivanishvili, declined to comment on the poll
when contacted by Bloomberg as she had not seen it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
