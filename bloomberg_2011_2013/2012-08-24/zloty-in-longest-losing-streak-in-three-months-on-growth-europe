The zloty headed for the longest
streak of losses in three months on concern the economy is
slowing while  Greece  sought to win more time from European
counterparts to meet economic targets.  The zloty declined 0.3 percent to 4.1066 per euro as of
12:29 p.m. in Warsaw. The currency’s 1.4 percent drop in the
past six days compares with a 0.3 percent weakening for
Hungarian forint and a 0.4 percent loss for the Czech koruna in
the same period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Polish currency is paring this month’s rally to the
strongest level in 12 months as the European debt crisis curbs
exports. Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is meeting German
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  today. Germany can’t extend funding for
Greece and its exit from the currency union would “not be a
problem for the euro,”  Volker Kauder , the parliamentary caucus
leader for Merkel’s  Christian Democratic Union , said today.  The recent rally in central European currencies “has been
essentially fueled by enhanced optimism surrounding the eurozone
crisis,”  Benoit Anne , head of emerging markets strategy at
Societe Generale SA in London wrote in an e-mail. The currencies
are now “looking vulnerable and the zloty is the proxy for the
whole region.”  The rally in the zloty will reverse in the next six months
as economic slowdown may prompt Polish policy makers to seek a
weaker currency to stimulate growth, Citigroup Inc. wrote in a
note to clients yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
