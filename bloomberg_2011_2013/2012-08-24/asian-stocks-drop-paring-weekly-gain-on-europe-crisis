Asian  stocks  fell, with the region’s
benchmark index retreating from the highest level since May, on
signs of slower growth in the U.S. and China and amid concern
Europe’s leaders aren’t making progress on the debt crisis.  Nissan Motor Co., a carmaker that counts  North America  as
its biggest market, fell 1.5 percent in Tokyo after U.S jobless
claims rose more than expected. Aluminum Corp. of China fell 2.1
percent in  Hong Kong  after Dallas Federal Reserve economists
said overstated data may have masked the severity of China’s
slowdown.  Makita Corp. (6586) , a Japanese maker of power tools that
depends on Europe for more than 40 percent of sales, slid 1.1
percent.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index slid 1.2 percent to 120.36 as
of 8:21 p.m. in Tokyo, erasing this week’s advance. The gauge
yesterday closed at the highest level since May 4.  “The rally seems to have been a bit more about hope over
reality,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of
investment markets research at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management, which oversees about $150 billion. “Clearly
economic data has been pretty poor. The practicalities of what
needs to be done to address this are huge.”  Asia’s equity benchmark climbed 12 percent from a June low
through yesterday on bets monetary authorities in the U.S.,
Europe and China would take action to boost slowing economic
growth. Stocks on the index were valued at 12.6 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.7 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 11.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  and South Korea’s Kospi
slid 1.2 percent, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index retreated
0.8 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.3 percent. The Shanghai
Composite Index dropped 1 percent.  U.S. Jobs  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today. The gauge
slid 0.8 percent yesterday, the most in a month, after a report
showed the number of applications for  unemployment benefits 
climbed last week to a one-month high. Jobless claims rose for a
second week to 372,000, exceeding the 365,000 median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Exporters fell. Nissan slid 1.5 percent to 765 yen. Yue
Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd., which makes shoes for Nike Inc.
and gets 29 percent of sales in the U.S., lost 2.6 percent to
A$22.75. Makita slid 1.1 percent to 2,933 yen. Cosco Pacific
Ltd., a shipping company which operates a port terminal in
 Greece , declined 1 percent to HK$10.40.  Europe Crisis  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said Europe is in one of
its deepest crises, while the country’s finance minister,
 Wolfgang Schaeuble , said allowing Greece more time to meet its
debt obligations would not solve the country’s problems.  China may have overstated 2012 industrial production data
to conceal the economy’s weakness, Dallas Fed economists Janet
Koech and Jian Wang wrote in a paper. Separately, HSBC Holdings
Plc cut China’s 2012 growth forecast to 8 percent from 8.4
percent.  Bank of China Ltd. , the nation’s third-largest lender by
assets, slid 1.3 percent to HK$2.95 after posting the slowest
quarterly profit growth in three years.  Whitehaven Coal Ltd. slumped 11 percent to A$3.09 in Sydney
after a group led by billionaire shareholder  Nathan Tinkler  said
it isn’t proceeding with a takeover offer.  Among shares that rose, China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd.
advanced as much as 5.8 percent to HK$13.78. The nation’s
second-largest mobile-phone company reported second-quarter
profit beat analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
