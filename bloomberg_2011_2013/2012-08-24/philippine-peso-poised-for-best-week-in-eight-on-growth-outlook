The Philippine peso headed for its
best week in eight after the government said it plans to
increase spending, boosting the nation’s economic growth outlook.
 Government bonds  were little changed.  The country’s balance of payments reached a 20-month high
of $3.18 billion in July, official data showed on Aug. 22.
Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said yesterday that last
month’s budget deficit, the biggest since December, is within
expectations and the government has fiscal space to pump prime
the economy. Gross domestic product will increase as much as 6
percent this year, faster than the 3.9 percent growth in 2011,
Budget Secretary Butch Abad told reporters last month.  “In the grander scheme of things, the growth story holds
up,” said  Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-based economist at
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. “The strong balance of payments is
also a boost, and adds to the shine of the peso.”  The peso climbed 0.7 percent this week to 42.123 per dollar
as of 9:53 a.m. in Manila, the most since the week ended July 6,
Tullett Prebon Plc prices showed. The currency was little
changed today. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged this
week and today at 6.30 percent.  The  Philippines  reported a budget shortfall of 39.2 billion
pesos ($931 million) yesterday. Gross domestic product  increased  
5.6 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, compared
with 6.4 percent in the preceding three months, according to the
median estimate of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  before
official data due Aug. 30.  The yield on the 9.125 percent bonds due September 2016 was
steady at 4.40 percent today and for the week, according to
prices from Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
