A bid by some Republicans to return
the U.S. to the gold standard is unlikely because of a lack of
international agreement on the matter and insufficient supply,
according to the industry-funded World Gold Council.  Annual output growth in gold “may not necessarily match
the appropriate growth in the monetary base,” David Schraeder,
a spokesman of the London-based council, said today in an e-mailed response to questions.  Drafters of the  Republican Party ’s 2012 platform called for
the creation of a commission to “consider the feasibility” of
a return to the gold standard “to set a fixed value” for the
dollar, according to a 60-page draft of political positions and
principles that will be submitted for adoption when the national
convention begins Aug. 27 in Tampa,  Florida , the Wall Street
Journal reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
