Sky Network Television Ltd. (SKT) , New
Zealand’s biggest pay television company, fell the most in three
months after saying that profit in this fiscal year will be
lower than analysts expect.  Net income will be NZ$120 million ($97 million) to NZ$125
million in the year ending June 30, 2013, from NZ$122.8 million
a year earlier, the Auckland-based company said in a statement.
The average analyst forecast was NZ$138 million, it said. The
stock fell 3.2 percent, headed for its biggest fall since May 16.  The forecast was less than analysts’ “possibly” because
of the costs of Olympics coverage and its delayed Igloo service,
a cheaper product it’s developing with  Television New Zealand ,
Sky said in a presentation about its full-year results.  Sky  shares  fell 17 cents to NZ$5.08 as at 12 p.m. in
Wellington. Earlier, they fell as low as NZ$5.01.  Sky, 44 percent owned by  Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp., said
profit rose 2.2 percent in the year ended June 30 after higher
expenses incurred during the  Rugby World Cup  were offset by an
increase in customer numbers and revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
