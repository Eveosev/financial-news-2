The  European Central Bank  buying
 government bonds  in conjunction with  Europe ’s bailout fund would
be positive for sovereign credit ratings as long as it doesn’t
substitute for private investors,  Fitch Ratings  said.  Purchases by the ECB and the bailout fund “would likely be
credit-positive and ease downward pressure on sovereign ratings
in the euro zone,” Fitch said in a report to investors
published today. At the same time, if the official sector were
to replace private investors rather than support  market access ,
“the reliance on policy-conditional external financial support
would not be consistent with a high investment-grade sovereign
rating,” Fitch said.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said on Aug. 2 the central bank
may buy government bonds in tandem with the bailout fund to stem
rising borrowing costs and that concerns of private investors
about its senior creditor status “will be addressed.” The ECB
was exempt from the biggest debt restructuring in history
earlier this year when Greek bond holders had to write off more
half of their investment.  Fitch said the ECB would have to “credibly address the
seniority issue” as it may hamper the effectiveness of any bond
market intervention, with private investors fearing
subordination in the case of a default.  The concern is that even if the ECB does “credibly pre-
commit” not to exercise its preferred creditor status in the
event of a default, its bond purchases are likely to be
associated with those of the bailout fund, which also enjoys
preferential status, Fitch said, adding this implies “some
subordination of private creditors.”  Still, “subordination will not necessarily dominate the
positive aspects” of a purchase program, “especially in the
context of a well-designed policy program that enjoys domestic
political support and is effectively implemented,” Fitch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
