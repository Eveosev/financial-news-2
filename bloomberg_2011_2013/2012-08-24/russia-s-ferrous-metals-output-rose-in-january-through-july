Russia’s output of ferrous metals
and products increased in the January through July period
compared with a year earlier, the  Economy Ministry  said.  Cast iron production rose 7.3 percent to 29.6 million
metric tons, steel output added 4.5 percent to 41.6 million
tons, and rolled steel increased 5.9 percent to 36.4 million
tons in the first seven months of the year compared with 2011,
the ministry said on its website today.  Rolled steel exports rose 11 percent to 14 million tons in
the period, it said.  Production of steel pipes dropped 11 percent to 5.47
million tons because of reduced oil and gas industry demand, the
ministry said. Pipe shipments rose 24 percent to 786,400 tons
with Kazakhstan the biggest buyer of about 29 percent of it,
according to the website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
