Honda Motor Co. expects its August
deliveries to be up “40-plus percent” on U.S. demand for Civic
small cars and CR-V crossovers, buoying a 27 percent annual rise
to the company’s best sales in the region in five years.  Deliveries of Honda and Acura vehicles will reach at least
1.46 million this year, U.S. Executive Vice President  John Mendel  said in an Aug. 23 interview in  Santa Barbara ,
 California . That would be Tokyo-based Honda’s best U.S. sales
since 2007 as its North American plants work overtime to supply
dealers asking for more Civics and CR-Vs, he said.  “We’re running at 120 to 130 percent of capacity at some
of our plants, and still it’s my leaky tub,” Mendel said.
“When sales are increasing at the same rate your production is
increasing, you’re not gaining ground in inventory.”  Honda,  Japan ’s third-largest automaker, plans to accelerate
U.S. sales in 2012’s second half as North American production
grows and a new Accord sedan and modified Civic small car are
added. Natural disasters in  Asia  in 2011 pared output of parts
needed by Honda’s North American factories. The company’s U.S.
deliveries grew 19 percent in this year’s first seven months,
aided by a 45 percent gain in July.  Honda’s North American factories made 75 percent more
vehicles in 2012’s first half. More than 87 percent of Honda and
Acura models sold in the first half were produced in  North
America , up from 84 percent a year earlier.  The company’s U.S. sales peaked at 1.55 million vehicles in
2007, dropping to 1.43 million in 2008 as deliveries plummeted
industrywide because of the recession. In 2011, Honda sold 1.15
million cars and light trucks.  ‘Good Shape’  Production is surging to make up for lost inventory last
year and dealer shortages that continued into 2012’s first
quarter, Mendel said. With industrywide sales continuing to
rebound, dealers simply want more vehicles, he said.  “Coming into August, I think we’re in very good shape, in
terms of inventory and attitude” of dealers, Mendel said.
“Accord is moving very well. Civic is moving well. CR-V is
doing well.”  Accord sales gained 28 percent this year through July,
while Civic rose 32 percent and CR-V 34 percent. Among midsize
sedans, Accord trails only  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Camry; Civic is
the top-selling small car in the market; and CR-V ranks as the
best-selling sport-utility vehicle.  Increased Spending  Incentives, mainly in the form of discounted loans and
leases, have risen particularly on the Accord as the model is
soon to be replaced, Mendel said.  The company spent an average of $2,263 a vehicle in July,
up 8.9 percent from a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp.
While that amount is below an industry average of $2,482, the
company now spends more than Toyota and  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  at
$1,849 and $829, according to Autodata.  Spending should moderate after the release of the new
Accord in September, Mendel said.  “The bottom line is if it’s higher than zero, it’s higher
than we want it,” he said.  Honda’s U.S. headquarters is in Torrance, California. The
company’s  American depositary receipts  gained 0.5 percent to
$33.33 yesterday in  New York . They have advanced 9.1 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
