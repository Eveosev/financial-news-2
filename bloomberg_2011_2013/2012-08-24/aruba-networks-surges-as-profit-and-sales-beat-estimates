Aruba Networks Inc. (ARUN) , a maker of
components for mobile devices, surged the most in a year after
reporting fiscal fourth-quarter sales and profit that exceeded
the company’s forecast and analysts’ estimates.  The shares climbed 14 percent to $19.36 at the close in  New
York , for the biggest gain since Aug. 26, 2011. The stock has
gained 4.5 percent this year.  Revenue in the period ended in July rose 22 percent to
$139.2 million, exceeding the company’s May forecast for sales
of $136 million to $138 million, the Sunnyvale, California-based
company said in a statement yesterday. Profit excluding some
items was 18 cents a share, topping the company’s projection of
16 to 17 cents. Analysts on average had expected adjusted profit
of 17 cents a share on sales of $136.9 million, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Aruba posted a “solid year-end finish, and frankly better
than we expected,” said  Joanna Makris , an analyst at Mizuho
Securities Inc. in New York, in a research report.  “We
continue to view Aruba as a primary beneficiary of pervasive
mobile device and tablet adoption in the enterprise - a market
we believe is hitting an inflection point, requiring an
architectural shift in the access network.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
