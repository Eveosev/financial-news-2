South Korea ’s won dropped from a
one-week high and bonds advanced as expectations for further
monetary stimulus by the U.S. faded after a policy maker said he
would resist more Federal Reserve action.  Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis President  James Bullard 
said yesterday that recent signs of improvement in the economy
would prompt him to oppose any new Fed program to buy bonds,
known as quantitative easing. The central bank said in minutes
released this week that many participants at the latest meeting
favored more stimulus measures. The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  of shares
dropped as overseas investors sold more of the nation’s equities
than they bought for the first time since Aug. 3.  “There are increased doubts whether the Fed will actually
perform a third round of quantitative easing or not,” said Cho Young Bok, a Seoul-based currency dealer for Daegu Bank.
“Still, we may see South Korean exporters selling the dollar as
the won weakens, which will limit won’s losses.”  The won weakened 0.3 percent to 1,134.15 per dollar in
 Seoul , data compiled by Bloomberg show. It touched 1,129.35
yesterday, the strongest level since Aug. 14, and was little
changed for the week. One-month implied volatility for the won,
a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 17
basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 7.18 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2015 slid four basis points to 2.84 percent, the lowest since
Aug. 13, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. The rate dropped nine
basis points this week. Three-year debt futures rose 0.16 to
106.06 and the one-year interest-rate swap fell two basis points
to 2.90 percent.  “Bonds are being supported as stocks fall on
disappointment over further monetary easing,” said Kong Dong Rak, a Seoul-based bond analyst at Taurus Investment &
Securities Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
