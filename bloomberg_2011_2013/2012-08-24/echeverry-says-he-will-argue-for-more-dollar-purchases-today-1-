Outgoing Colombian Finance Minister
Juan Carlos Echeverry said he will argue for increased dollar
purchases at his final central bank policy meeting today.  “I have asked the central bank to please reduce interest
rates,” Echeverry said in an interview on Caracol Radio. “My
other big request has been for more aggressive purchases of
dollars to give us a more competitive  exchange rate , and today I
will insist on both things.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
