Colombia  tightened capital rules for
banks to vaccinate the banking system from financial
“viruses,” outgoing Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry
said.  “The financial sector has been developing internationally,
with the introduction of new agents in the local market, and the
expansion of our banks into foreign markets, which reinforces
the need to bring our regulations closer to international
standards,” the  Finance Ministry  said in a statement.  The new rules take effect August 2013, and lay the
foundations for Colombia to reach Basel III standards, said
Gerardo Hernandez, head of the country’s financial regulator.  “The measure keeps at 9 percent the minimum adequacy
level, that is, the relation that ought to hold between capital
and assets, and introduces a new measure, that of basic
adequacy, that affects the relation between ‘purer’ capital and
assets, with a minimum level of 4.5 percent,” the ministry said
in its statement.  The measures help address the central bank’s concerns with
the pace of credit growth said  Francisco Rodriguez , a  New York- 
based economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  In the statement accompanying its August policy meeting
today, the central bank said consumer credit growth remains at
high levels, even though it has moderated.  Policy makers cut their benchmark interest rate a quarter
point for a second straight month, to 4.75 percent, citing the
slowing world economy that’s curbing demand for the Andean
nation’s commodities exports.  “This is consistent with the idea that the government
wanted to allay concern with credit growth at the central bank,
which may have been behind resistance to further rate cuts,”
Rodriguez said, in response to an e-mailed question.  Central bank co-director Carlos Gustavo Cano said in a
February interview that it is difficult for any central bank to
pursue multiple goals, including its inflation target and
financial stability, using only  interest rates .  To contact the reporters on this story:
