The cost of insuring corporate bonds
from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region rose, headed for a
second weekly increase, according to credit-default swap
traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 2 basis points to 149 as of 8:26
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The gauge is set for the biggest daily gain since Aug. 13, and
second consecutive weekly increase, according to data provider
CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 2 basis points to 199 as
of 9:24 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The gauge
is set to advance 13.5 basis points from Aug. 17, heading for
the first weekly increase in three, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index climbed 3 basis points to
156 as of 11:22 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole SA prices show.
The gauge has rebounded from 148.3 basis points on Aug. 21, the
lowest since April 4, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
