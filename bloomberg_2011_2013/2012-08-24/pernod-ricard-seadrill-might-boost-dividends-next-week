Pernod Ricard SA (RI) ,  Seadrill (SDRL)  Ltd. and
 WPP (WPP)  Plc are among 13 companies in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
that may boost their dividends next week, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Pernod Ricard, France’s biggest distiller, may raise its
final dividend by 12 percent to 86 euro cents, according to
Bloomberg Dividend Forecasts that factor in earnings and options
prices. Seadrill, the second-largest owner of ultra-deepwater
rigs, may increase its dividend by 12 percent to 84 cents. WPP,
the biggest  advertising agency , may boost its interim payout to
shareholders by 23 percent to 9.14 pence, the data show.  Companies in the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  could increase shareholder
payouts by 5.6 percent this year, according to estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Per-share earnings are forecast to grow
48 percent in that period.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the copper producer controlled by Chile’s
Luksic family, might raise its payout by 13 percent to 9 cents,
while  G4S Plc (GFS) , the world’s largest security-guard supplier, may
do so by 5 percent to 3.59 pence.  Bunzl Plc (BNZL) ,  Admiral Group Plc (ADM)  and  Zardoya Otis SA (ZOT)  are also
among the companies that may increase their dividends next week.  The Stoxx 600 has slumped 2.4 percent so far this week, and
is heading for the first weekly decline since June, as French,
German and Greek leaders met to discuss Greece’s bailout program
and Japan’s trade deficit unexpectedly widened. The benchmark
measure dropped 0.5 percent to 266.39 at 2:55 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
