Susan M. Ciccarone, a managing
director in  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s financial institutions
group, has left the company after three years to become chief
financial officer at  Emerging Global Advisors LLC .  Ciccarone, 39, started this week, according to Bill Fallon,
a spokesman for New York-based Emerging Global, who declined to
comment on who she replaced.  The asset-management company, which advises the EGShares
family of exchange-traded funds, last year hired Marten S. Hoekstra as chief executive officer, replacing Robert C. Holderith, who founded the firm in 2008 and is now president.
Hoekstra, 51, was previously CEO of the Americas wealth-
management business at Zurich-based  UBS AG (UBSN) , where he worked for
26 years.  Ciccarone joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 2009,
after having worked at UBS since 2002, according to records
maintained by the  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority . She
was promoted to managing director, the company’s second-highest
rank, in 2010. At Goldman Sachs, she specialized in advising
banks, including  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ’s $6.3 billion cash
purchase of Chrysler Financial Corp. from Cerberus Capital
Management LP, which was completed last year.  “I am happy to join a firm that is leading the effort to
provide investors with tools for core emerging-market investment
allocations,” Ciccarone said in a statement provided by
Emerging Global.  Goldman Sachs, based in  New York , is the fifth-biggest U.S.
bank by assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
