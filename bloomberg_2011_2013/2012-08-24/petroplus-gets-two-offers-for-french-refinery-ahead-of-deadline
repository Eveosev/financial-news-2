Petroplus Holdings AG got two bids
for its Petit-Couronne refinery in  France  ahead of today’s
deadline for offers, according to the plant’s management.  The bids are from Netoil Inc. and Alafandi Petroleum Group,
Zug, Switzerland-based Petroplus said today in a statement. A
French court is scheduled to announce which company gets the
refinery Sept. 4.  APG and Netoil had already signaled an interest in the
refinery to the court July 24 and have now completed the
necessary paperwork, Petroplus said. The deadline for offers is
midnight tonight.  Netoil, based in Dubai, has said it plans to upgrade the
plant and keep it running if its offer is successful. The
154,000 barrel-a-day plant was shut in January after Petroplus,
once  Europe ’s largest independent refiner, filed for bankruptcy.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , which previously owned Petit-
Couronne, has been operating the facility since June under a
six-month tolling arrangement where it supplies crude and takes
ownership of the products.  Petit-Couronne was one of five plants in Europe operated by
Petroplus. Three of its facilities have been sold to trading
companies that will keep the sites operating, while the fourth,
Coryton in the U.K., will be converted to storage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
