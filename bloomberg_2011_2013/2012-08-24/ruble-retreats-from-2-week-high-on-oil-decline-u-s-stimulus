The ruble retreated from a two-week
high as Urals crude declined and a U.S. Federal Reserve policy
maker said the Fed should refrain from stimulus given recent
signs of improvement in the economy.  The Russian currency weakened 0.6 percent versus the dollar
to 31.8625 at 7 p.m. in Moscow. The ruble gained less than 0.1
percent against the euro at 39.8650, leaving it 0.3 percent
lower against the central bank’s currency basket, which is 55
percent dollars and 45 percent the common currency.  Urals crude retreated 1.1 percent to $113.53. Fed Bank of
St. Louis President  James Bullard  said late yesterday recent
signs of improvement in the economy would prompt him to oppose
any new program by the Fed to buy bonds to reduce borrowing
costs.  “This statement cuts investor appetite for risky assets
including the ruble,” Alexey Egorov, currency analyst at Nomos
Bank in Moscow, said by phone.  Investors increased bets on the ruble weakening against the
dollar, with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at
32.3511 in three months versus 32.1905 on Aug. 23.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s address to economists and
central bankers at the Kansas City Fed’s conference in  Jackson
Hole ,  Wyoming , next week may improve risk appetite, Ivan Sinelnikov, a macroeconomist at Gazprombank in Moscow, said by
e-mail.  “It may give a boost for market participants to start
buying risky assets,” Sinelnikov said. “The ruble should
benefit from this process.”  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose three basis points to 223,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. Yields on
the government’s ruble bonds due April 2021 fell two basis
points to 7.86 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
