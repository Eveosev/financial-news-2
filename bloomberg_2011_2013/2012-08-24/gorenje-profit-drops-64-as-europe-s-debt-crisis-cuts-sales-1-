Gorenje Group d.d.,  Slovenia’s
biggest appliance maker, reported a 64 percent drop in first-
half profit as  Europe ’s debt crisis cut sales.  Net income fell to 2.3 million euros ($2.9 million) from
6.4 million euros a year earlier, the Velenje-based company said
in an e-mailed statement today. Consolidated revenue for the
period decreased 17 percent to 618.6 million euros.  “The debt crisis, high level of unemployment, high prices
of raw and processed material” affected Gorenje operations in
the first half, it said.  Its shares retreated 2.5 percent to 4.05 euros at 11:36
a.m. in Ljubljana, falling for a fourth day and extending this
year’s decline to 16 percent.  Slovenia’s biggest exporter, whose net financial debt fell
by 22 million euros to 424.4 million euros, will continue to
reduce liabilities “by sound management of inventories and
receivables, and divestment activities,” Gorenje Chief
Executive Officer Franjo Bobinac said in the statement.  Gorenje, which has shifted cooker production from  Finland 
to the  Czech Republic , plans to move manufacturing of washing
machines, dryers and dishwashers from Sweden to its home-town
Velenje in 2013. Russia, the U.S., Australia, the Middle and  Far
East  remain key markets to generate growth, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
