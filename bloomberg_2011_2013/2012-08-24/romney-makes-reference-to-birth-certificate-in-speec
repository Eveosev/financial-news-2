Republican challenger  Mitt Romney , at a rally today in Michigan, alluded to doubts raised by some of  Barack Obama ’s opponents that the president was born in the U.S.  “Nobody has asked to see my birth certificate,” Romney, standing with his wife, Ann, told the crowd in Commerce, near the hospital in Detroit where he was born. “They know this is the place where we were born and raised.”  Obama, the son of a mother from Kansas and a father from Kenya, has provided a long-form birth certificate showing he was born in Hawaii in 1961.
