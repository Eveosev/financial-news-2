Eco-Bat Technologies Ltd., the lead
producer, reported a 79 percent drop in second quarter profit
after prices of the metal used in batteries declined.  Net income was 7.5 million pounds ($11.9 million) in
the three months ended June 30 compared with 36.5 million pounds
in the same period a year earlier, the Matlock, England-based
company said in an e-mailed report today. Revenue dropped 10
percent to 421.9 million pounds.  Lead for delivery in three months averaged $1,986.29 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange in the second quarter,
down 22 percent from a year earlier. Lead sales were little
changed at 206,000 tons versus 207,000 tons, Eco-Bat said.  There was a quarterly “mark-to-market” loss on
outstanding contracts at 2.9 million pounds compared with a gain
of 22.8 million pounds a year earlier, Eco-Bat said.  ((Eco-Bat will hold a conference call at 2 p.m. U.K. time.
