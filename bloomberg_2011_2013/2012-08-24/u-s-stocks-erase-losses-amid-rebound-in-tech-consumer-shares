U.S. stocks rose, erasing earlier
declines, as a rebound in technology and consumer discretionary
shares overshadowed disappointing economic data and concern over
Europe’s debt crisis.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent to
1,404.38 at 10:49 a.m. New York time, after dropping as much as
0.3 percent.  Stocks retreated earlier after a report showed demand for
U.S. capital goods such as machinery and communications gear
dropped in July by the most in eight months, indicating
companies are pulling back on investment.  Two central bank officials said European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  may wait until Germany’s Constitutional
Court rules on the legality of Europe’s permanent bailout fund
before unveiling full details of his plan to buy government
bonds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
