Republican  Mitt Romney  said it would
be “unacceptable” for  Iran  to develop a nuclear weapon and
pledged that, if elected president, he would keep all options
open to prevent that from happening.  “We have to maintain all options, but Iran going nuclear”
would “be unacceptable,” Romney said in an interview broadcast
tonight on CBS Evening News.  If Iran does develop nuclear weapons, he said, it would
mean there is a possibility terrorist groups could bring
“fissile material to our continent.”  The presumptive Republican presidential nominee also said
he is concerned about  Syria  using weapons of mass destruction in
the civil strife convulsing that nation.  “We of course have to retain the option of protecting
ourselves from weapons of mass destruction,” Romney said.
“America has to be ready.”  During a stop in  Israel  last month, Romney said halting a
nuclear Iran is the “highest national-security priority” for
the U.S. It’s “right” for America to back a unilateral Israeli
military strike on Iran to stop the country from developing
nuclear capabilities, he said then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
