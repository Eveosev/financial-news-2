Five cyclists stand to inherit  Lance Armstrong ’s seven Tour de  France  wins after he is stripped of
the titles by anti-doping authorities. Three of those cyclists
have served doping bans and one may be probed.  Armstrong has been banned from the sport of cycling for
life after refusing to fight drug allegations by the U.S. Anti-
Doping Agency, with the American saying it was pointless to
fight a “witch hunt.”  Armstrong, 40, won the Tour de France every year from 1999
to 2005, a record for the sport’s most prestigious race. He
survived testicular cancer early in his career, and created
Livestrong, a charity that has raised more than $470 million for
the fight against cancer, according to its website.  Germany ’s Jan Ullrich, winner of the  Tour de France  in
1997, finished second to Armstrong three times in 2000-2003. He
was banned in February for two years and had results between
2005 and 2007 voided after being found guilty of blood doping.  Ullrich told  Deutsche Presse-Agentur  that he was proud of
his second-place finishes and was giving no thought to Armstrong
losing his titles.  The Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne,
 Switzerland , said at the time that the German’s DNA was matched
to blood bags seized by police in a 2006 anti-doping
investigation in  Spain . He had also served a six-month ban for
testing positive for amphetamines in 2002, which he said came
from taking drugs on a night out.  Alex Zuelle, the runner-up to Armstrong in 1999, was part
of the Festina team thrown out of the 1998 Tour after its coach
was caught with banned performance-enhancing substances. The
Swiss rider was banned for seven months after admitting taking
the performance-enhancing drug EPO.  Basso Ban  Two years after finishing second in 2005,  Italy ’s Ivan Basso confessed to being part of a blood-doping ring in Spain,
Italy’s Olympic authority said at the time. He served a two-year
ban in 2007 and 2008 for “attempted doping” although he denied
taking any.  Cycling News reported that the German national doping
agency said it may open an investigation into whether three
riders, including Germany’s 2004 second-place finisher Andreas Kloeden, used illegal doping or products.  Following is a list of the top-three finishers in the Tour
de France from 1999 to 2005:  To contact the reporter on this story:
