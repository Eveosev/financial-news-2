Belgian  business confidence  declined
in August as trade sentiment plunged to the lowest since March.  The confidence index for  Belgium  fell to minus 11.8 from
minus 11.3 in July, the Brussels-based  National Bank of Belgium 
said in a statement today. Economists had predicted a decline to
minus 12 in August, according to the median of 10 estimates in a
Bloomberg News  survey .  “Confidence dropped the most sharply in the trade sector,
following four months of increasing optimism,” the central bank
said in the report. “Traders are expecting demand to fall back
and are likely to sharply cut back their orders from
suppliers.”  Today’s data add to signs that Belgium’s economy, which
contracted 0.6 percent in the second quarter, is sliding into a
recession along with the euro area as a whole.  Consumer
confidence  in Belgium fell in August to the lowest level since
February amid mounting concerns over the economic outlook and
joblessness, which households expect will reduce their capacity
to save.  The Ifo institute in Munich releases its August report on
business confidence in Germany, Europe’s largest economy, on
Aug. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
