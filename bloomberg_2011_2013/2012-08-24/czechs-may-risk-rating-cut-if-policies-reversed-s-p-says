The  Czech Republic ’s credit rating
may come under downward pressure if its public finances worsen
or the country reverses fiscal policies pursued by the current
government,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  The S&P affirmed today its AA- sovereign rating assigned to
the Czech Republic, saying its “financial, monetary, and
economic institutions remain robust and stable, enabling the
prosperous economy to adjust quickly to adverse shocks.”  The rating reflected a view of the Czech Republic’s
“prudently” managed and balanced economy, which has low levels
of foreign borrowing, a deposit-funded banking sector with
minimal lending in foreign currency, and an independent central
bank that has kept both consumer price  inflation  and  interest
rates  at low levels, according to the S&P.  “Upward pressure on the ratings could come from a decline
in the Czech Republic’s external financing requirements,” the
S&P said in a statement. “On the other hand, downward pressure
on the ratings could mount if the public finances deteriorate,
or if a new government, formed after the 2014 election, reverses
some of the current government’s public finance reforms.”  The Cabinet in Prague initially targeted a public-finance
 deficit  of 3 percent of economic output this year, while its
latest estimate saw the shortfall at 3.2 percent of gross
domestic product due to a  recession . The government plans to
trim the deficit to 2.9 percent of GDP next year.  “We anticipate slight fiscal slippage from the budget in
2012-2013 due to weak economic growth,” the S&P said.  The fiscal outlook is clouded by uncertainties as financial
compensation to churches, if approved, could be a one-time boost
in the public-finance deficit and some of government measures to
narrow the gap have yet to be approved by the lower house of
Parliament, the ratings company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
