Italian and Spanish notes extended a
decline as two European Central Bank officials said policy
makers may wait for Germany’s Constitutional Court to rule on
the legality of Europe’s permanent bailout fund before unveiling
details of a plan to buy government bonds.  Spain’s two-year  note yield  climbed seven basis points to
3.79 percent at 12:24 p.m. and the rate on similar-maturity
Italian securities increased 13 basis points to 3.33 percent.  Germany’s 10-year bunds extended an advance, pushing the
yield five basis points lower to 1.33 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
