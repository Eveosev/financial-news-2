Santander (SAN)  UK Plc, the British unit
of Spain’s biggest lender, could see a 12 percent increase in
2013 pretax profit after raising its U.K. mortgage rates, Morgan
Stanley analysts led by Chris Manners said.  The increase may help other banks if they follow suit, said
Manners.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s 2013 underlying pretax
profit could rise 18 percent because of the size of its mortgage
business, although the bank has already raised its rate this
year, he said in a note to clients yesterday.  Santander UK’s profit before tax for 2011 fell to 1.26
billion pounds ($2 billion). The bank raises its standard
variable rate, the rate customers pay after a cheaper rate
expires, by 0.5 percentage points to 4.74 percent in October.  “We note potential negative impacts to the wider economy
and confidence if banks continue to raise  mortgage rates ,”
wrote Manners. Fewer house sales and lower disposable income are
among the risks, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
