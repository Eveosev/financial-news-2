Czech shares declined, with the main
index headed for its first back-to-back drop in a month, after
U.S. data signaled weakness in the world’s largest economy and
amid sluggish progress resolving Europe’s debt crisis.  The 14-member  PX (PX)  equity index slid 0.4 percent to 951.20 by
11:49 a.m. in Prague, extending a 0.2 percent drop yesterday,
set for its first two-day retreat since July 23.  Erste Group
Bank AG (EBS)  of Austria and  New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech producer of coking coal, declined 1 percent.  Basic resources companies and banks were among the biggest
stock decliners in Europe today and commodities dropped after a
report yesterday showed jobless claims in the U.S. rose more
than forecast last week. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President Francois Hollande will meet the Greek Prime
Minister Antonis Samaras today and tomorrow to discuss the pace
of reform.  “American markets yesterday closed in the red, mainly
because of worse data from the labor market and concern that the
resolution of the situation in the euro zone has been coming
along very slowly,” Tomas Mencik, a stock analyst at Cyrrus AS
brokerage in Brno, Czech Republic, wrote in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
