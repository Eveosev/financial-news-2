The  Philippine peso  gained the most
in a month as the Group of Seven nations agreed to restrain the
yen, which has surged since an earthquake and tsunami struck
Japan a week ago.  The peso rose from yesterday’s six-week low as Japanese
Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said today each of the G-7
members will sell yen as their markets open. The yen reached the
strongest level since World War II yesterday on speculation
Japanese investors and companies were repatriating funds.  “The G-7 is helping stabilize the market and we’re seeing
some recovery in the peso from all the  risk aversion  caused by
Japan’s worries,” said Rafael Algarra, treasurer at Security
Bank Corp. in  Manila .  The peso rose 0.5 percent to 43.705 per dollar as of the 4
p.m. close in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The
currency declined 0.1 percent this week, its second five-day
loss, and touched 44.01 yesterday, the weakest since Feb. 2.  Remittances from Filipinos living overseas rose 7.6 percent
from a year earlier in January, the smallest gain in eight
months, official figures showed this week. The funds, which
totaled a record $18.8 billion in 2010, account for more than 10
percent of the Philippine economy.  Benchmark three-year bonds advanced for a fourth day. The
yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January 2014 dropped six
basis points to 5.10 percent, the lowest rate since Feb. 4,
according to Tradition Financial Services. The yield fell 15
basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, this week.  To contact the reporter for this story:
