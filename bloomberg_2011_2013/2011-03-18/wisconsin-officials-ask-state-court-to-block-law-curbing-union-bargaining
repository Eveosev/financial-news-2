A  Wisconsin  county prosecutor,
acting on complaints by three other public officials, asked a
state judge to block a law that would strip government unions of
most of their collective bargaining power.  At a hearing today in Madison, Wisconsin, Dane County
District Attorney Ismael Ozanne asked Circuit Court Judge
Maryann Sumi to block publication the measure signed into law by
Governor  Scott Walker  on March 11. Publication of the law gives
it its full force and effect.  Ozanne said in court papers that two state senators and two
members of Wisconsin’s assembly -- all Republicans -- violated a
state open meetings law in gathering to craft compromise
legislation then passed by both chambers.  State law required 24 hours notice before the legislation
could be considered by the joint committee of six senate and
assembly members, Ozanne said in a March 16 filing. The
legislators gave less than two hours notice of their March 9
meeting, according to Ozanne’s complaint.  The legislation championed by Walker, a first-term
Republican, requires annual recertification votes for union
representation and makes voluntary the payment of union dues.
The measure exempts firefighters and police officers.  The case is State of Wisconsin Ex Rel. Ismael R. Ozanne v.
Jeff Fitzgerald, 11cv1244,  Dane County , Wisconsin, Circuit
Court.  To contact the reporters on this story:
