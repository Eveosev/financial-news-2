  Tanzania  will increase spending
next year and target faster economic growth over the next five
years,  Reuters  said, citing Finance Minister Mustafa Mkulo.    Government spending  will probably rise by 7.9 percent to
11.97 trillion Tanzanian shillings in the year to June 2012,
matching the amount it expects to collect, Reuters said.  The east African economy may expand 6.8 percent to 10
percent over the next five years, Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
