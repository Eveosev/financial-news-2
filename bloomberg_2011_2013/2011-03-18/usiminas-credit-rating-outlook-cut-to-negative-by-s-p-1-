  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA (USIM5) , Brazil’s second-largest steelmaker, had its outlook cut to
negative by  Standard & Poor’s , signaling the credit rating on
its debt is more likely to be lowered than raised.  “The outlook revision to negative reflects the company’s
struggle to recover operating performance after market
difficulties in the past two years,” S&P, which rates Usiminas
BBB-, said today in a statement. Usiminas’s “performance lags
that of its peers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
