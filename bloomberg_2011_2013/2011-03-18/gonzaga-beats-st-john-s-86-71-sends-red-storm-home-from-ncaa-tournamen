(Corrects Hardy’s point total to 26 in third paragraph.)  Gonzaga shot 55 percent and
defeated  St. John’s  86-71, sending the Red Storm home after
their first game in the men’s national college basketball
tournament since 2002.  Gonzaga’s Marquise Carter had a career-high 26 points and
Steven Gray added 16 points, including four 3-pointers, in the
Southeast Region game in the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament tonight in Denver. Gonzaga went 9-for-15
from beyond the 3-point line.  Dwight Hardy had 26 points to lead St. John’s.  The Red Storm (21-12) were missing injured forward D.J.
Kennedy, who was the team’s third-leading scorer this season
with 10.4 points per game. Kennedy hurt his knee last week in
St. John’s loss to Syracuse in the Big East tournament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
