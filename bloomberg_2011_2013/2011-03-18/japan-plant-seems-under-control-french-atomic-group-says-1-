Japanese workers appear to have the
stricken Fukushima reactors “under control,” according to the
head of France’s atomic energy research organization.  “I think they have gained control,” Bernard Bigot of the
Commissariat a l’Energie Atomique, which owns a stake in reactor
maker  Areva SA (CEI) , said on RTL radio. “The challenge now is to
further cool reactors even if they are damaged and the spent
fuel pools.”  Power may be restored to one of the reactors today,
improving the odds that workers can stop a meltdown and further
radiation leaks. The U.S. military, which is flying unmanned
surveillance drones over the site about 135 miles (220
kilometers) north of  Tokyo  at  Japan ’s request, said it’s
“cautiously optimistic” that the damage can be contained.  “There is no massive release of radioactivity into the
atmosphere,” Bigot said. The containment vessels are largely
intact and there isn’t a need to build additional ones over the
damaged reactors.  “No one can ignore what has happened. We have to examine
how this drama happened, how it was managed and how we could
have avoided it,” Bigot said. “It was largely avoidable if the
cooling means had been immediately available on the site” after
the earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck.    France  has 58 nuclear reactors operated by state-controlled
Electricite de France SA. The government has announced safety
checks at each reactor while retaining the country’s policy of
relying on nuclear power.  To contact the reporters on this story:
