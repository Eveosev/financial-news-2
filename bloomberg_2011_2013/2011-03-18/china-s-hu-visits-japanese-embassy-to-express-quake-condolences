  China ’s President  Hu Jintao  visited
the Japanese embassy in Beijing today to extend condolences for
the victims of last week’s earthquake and tsunami, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported.  Hu and Premier Wen Jiabao have both expressed sympathy for
the victims of the March 11 disaster, which killed at least
6,500 people and left hundreds of thousands more homeless. China
sent a rescue team to Japan to assist in the recovery.  Hu’s gesture comes six months after Chinese protesters
demonstrated at the Japanese embassy during a standoff over the
detention of a Chinese fishing boat and its captain in disputed
waters. Polls in Japan showed trust of China plummeting over the
incident, which involved conflicting territorial claims over
uninhabited islands.  While China and  Japan  have had diplomatic relations for
four decades, the two nations fought a war from 1937-1945 in
which large portions of China were occupied and millions of
Chinese soldiers and civilians were killed.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
