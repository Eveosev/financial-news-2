Kenyan  oil companies  asked the
industry regulator to increase retail fuel prices by 2 shillings
($0.02) a liter (0.26 gallons) after the state-run National Oil
Corp. imported 55,000 metric tons of diesel at a higher price
than agreed during tendering,  Daily Nation  said.  Oil companies are refusing to buy the consignment, raising
fears of a shortage of the fuel, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said, citing an unidentified Energy Ministry official.    Kenya â€™s  Energy Regulatory Commission  on March 14 set
maximum retail prices for regular gasoline at 100.9 shillings a
liter in the capital, Nairobi, an increase of 2.8 percent from
the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
