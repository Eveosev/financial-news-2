The zloty’s recent weakening isn’t
a concern for  Poland  although further losses could provide
additional justification for increasing interest rates, central
bank Deputy Governor Witold Kozinski said today in Warsaw.  Kozinski told reporters that he expects the zloty to
strengthen this year, “although I don’t think it will
appreciate significantly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
