  Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. (PIK) ,  South
Africa ’s second-largest grocer, said it raised 500 million rand
($70.8 million) through the sale of three-month debt to improve
liquidity and fund expansion spending.  The securities, sold under a domestic medium-term note
program, pay a fixed interest rate of 5.815 percent, 24 basis
points, or 0.24 percentage point, above the Johannesburg inter-
bank acceptance rate, the company said in a statement today.
Investec Bank Ltd. arranged the sale while  Absa Capital , a unit
of Absa Ltd., the nation’s biggest retail lender, was joint
dealer. The notes are due June 17.  The program “will enable Pick n Pay to access short- and
long-term funding, diversify its funding sources, enhance its
liquidity position and provide funding flexibility,” according
to the statement. The retailer may issue a maximum amount of 2
billion rand under the program.  Pick n Pay, which plans to sell its Australian business,
Franklins, for A$215 million ($213.3 million), is also
expanding in  Africa , and plans to open four new stores in
Mozambique starting this month, it said in November.  The company had short-term debt of 36.7 million rand in the
first half through August, according to its financial statements
for the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
