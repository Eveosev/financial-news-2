Global financial efforts to bolster  Japan ’s economy after the March 11 earthquake may lead to
inflation later in the year, said James Bianco, president of
Bianco Research LLC in Chicago.  “All this liquidity, which is a virtue now, will be a vice
later,” Bianco said today in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with Tom Keene.  Group of Seven nations jointly intervened in the foreign
exchange market for the first time in more than a decade after
Japan’s currency soared, threatening the nation’s recovery from
last week’s temblor and ensuing tsunami.  (In the U.S., hear Bloomberg Radio on satellite radio: Sirius
