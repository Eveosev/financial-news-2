  Japan  will start testing of
agricultural and marine food products as early as today for
possible contamination by radioactivity, as the nation struggles
to stem pollution from the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant.  “We have requested each prefectural governor to start
testing to prevent shipments of contaminated foods into the
market,” Kumiko Tanaka at the policy planning and communication
division of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare said
today in a phone interview. “We expect testing to start as
early as today.”  Foods required for testing include grains, milk, vegetables,
meat and eggs, she said.  Asian countries have started to screen food imports from
Japan following explosions at the plant that raised radiation
levels at the complex to harmful levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
