Treasuries fell, paring a second
weekly gain, after Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said
some Group of Seven nations will perform joint currency
intervention, helping reduce demand for safer assets.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose three basis
points to 3.29 percent as of 9:08 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
