Coffee also gained, while cocoa and orange juice declined.  In the first three days of the this week, cotton tumbled

as 1.1 percent today.  “The world is looking now at commodities and saying there

global demand outstripped supplies.  The dollar was down 1.6 percent this week against a basket

more desirable,” Flanagan said.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery climbed 0.97 cent, or
