Dover Air Force Base in central  Delaware  was evacuated for more than two hours today, and a
nearby highway was temporarily closed, as security guards dealt
with a bomb scare.  The incident at the base, home of the C-5 and C-17 cargo
planes supporting U.S. military operations worldwide, involved
“a suspicious vehicle,” said Brett Kangas, a civilian
spokesman at the base.  Delaware State Police closed Route 1 during the incident,
which ended in early afternoon.  The 3,900-acre base is home to more than 6,000 military
personnel, as well as civilian contractors and 5,000 dependents,
and houses one of the largest military mortuaries in the world.  To contact the reporters on this story:
