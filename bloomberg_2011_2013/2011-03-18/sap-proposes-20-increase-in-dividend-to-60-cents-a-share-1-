  SAP AG (SAP) , the world’s largest maker
of business-management software, has proposed a 20 percent
increase in the annual dividend to 60 euro cents a share.  The dividend is subject to shareholders’ approval at the
annual meeting on May 25, and compares with a payout of 50 cents
for the previous year, the Walldorf, Germany-based company said
in a statement today. If approved, the total amount distributed
would be 713 million euros ($1 billion), equivalent to a payout
ratio of 39 percent, up from 34 percent.  SAP and competitors such as  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  have benefited
from a return to corporate and public-sector spending on
software. SAP said in January that it expects operating profit
to rise as much as 16 percent this year while software and
related services sales will climb as much as 14 percent.  SAP rose 1.3 percent to 40.595 euros at 4:52 p.m. in
Frankfurt trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
