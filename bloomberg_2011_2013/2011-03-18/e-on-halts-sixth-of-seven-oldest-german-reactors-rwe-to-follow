  E.ON AG (EOAN) , Germany’s largest utility,
halted the sixth of seven nuclear power plants  Chancellor Angela Merkel  ordered closed for safety checks, leaving  RWE AG (RWE)  due to
shut the last of the seven as early as today.  E.ON’s 1,345-megawatt Unterweser reactor stopped at 3:35
a.m. Berlin time today, according to data the company published
on its  website . The state of Hesse, where RWE’s 1,167-megawatt
Biblis A plant is located, has said it would issue an order for
the facility’s halt by today. Nuclear stations can take several
hours to shut down.  The E.ON halt brings the total nuclear capacity reduction
since March 15, when Merkel ordered the nationwide safety review
of the country’s oldest reactors to run through June, to 4
gigawatts. Two of the seven plants were offline when Merkel
announced the plan. The rest equals 25 percent of the 20.7
gigawatts installed over  Germany ’s 17 reactors.
