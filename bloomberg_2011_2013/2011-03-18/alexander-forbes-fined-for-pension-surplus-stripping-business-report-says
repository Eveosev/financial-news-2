Alexander Forbes Ltd., a South
African pension-fund administrator, was ordered by a high court
to pay 5.49 million rand for distribution to some pensioners
after it admitted guilt for its role in facilitating stripping
of surpluses of some retirement funds,  Business Report  said.  Alexander Forbes pleaded guillty to six counts of
contravening the Financial Institutions (Investment of Funds)
Act, the Johannesburg-based newspaper reported today, citing
proceedings at the South Gauteng High Court. The company will
also pay a 10,000 rand fine in addition to a 342 million-rand
civil claim it reached with Tony Mostert, the curator of the
affected funds, last year, Business Report said.        To contact the editor responsible for this story:
