Ukraine may sell corn
“intensively” to  Russia  before the end of the marketing year
on June 30, agriculture researcher APK-Inform said.  Ukraine has a surplus of 3.3 million metric tons of corn
and 2.1 million tons of wheat available for export, Rodion
Rybchynskyi, an analyst at the Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine-based
agriculture researcher, said today in a statement on its
website.  The Eastern European nation said in November it would sell
grains to partners in free-trade agreements outside of export
quotas imposed following last year’s drought. Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia,
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan,  Georgia  and Turkmenistan as well as
Macedonia were cited by the  Economy Ministry  as possible
customers.  Ukraine shipped 11,500 tons of corn to Russia in February,
APK-Inform said. Ukrainian wheat isn’t likely to be shipped to
Russia, Rybchynskyi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
