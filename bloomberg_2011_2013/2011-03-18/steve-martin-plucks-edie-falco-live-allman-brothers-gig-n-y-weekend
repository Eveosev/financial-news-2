Edie Falco plays a star-struck
woman who’s not as amiable as she seems in Eric Mendelsohn’s “3
Backyards.”  Her encounter with a neighboring celebrity is one of three
enigmatic stories set in suburban  Long Island . There’s also a
businessman spying on his wife, and a thieving daughter who
stumbles across something unsavory in a shack.  Mendelsohn is the only filmmaker to win two directing
awards at  Sundance  -- and one is for this film.  Cinema Arts Centre , 423 Park Ave., Huntington, NY,
Information: +1-631-423-3456;  http://cinemaartscentre.org . Also
playing at IFC Center, 323 6th Ave. at W. 3rd St. Information:

“Southbound,” are lining up on Broadway.  After a booking mix-up last year, (“Banana Shpeel”
indeed!) the group is back at the Beacon Theater for its annual
March ritual.  Gregg Allman’s seasoned veterans, including slide guitarist
Derek Trucks, have been melding ecstasy and improvisation for
over four decades, so get set for a luxury-length version of
“Mountain Jam.”  Through March 26 at the Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway.
Information: +1-212-465-6500;  http://www.beacontheatrenyc.com .  Saturday  Inspired by the natural world, artist  Michele Oka Doner 
works big, installing a mysteriously beautiful floor at Miami
International Airport, and she works small, scattering diamonds
along metal branches for eye-popping jewelry.  Take a look at her work in handmade paper at Dieu Donne
studios. Oka Doner’s artist book, “What is the White,”
explores color and perception through wax, felt, translucent and
opaque papers, while another has organic materials embedded in
abaca leaves.  “Neuration of the Genus” runs through April 23 at Dieu
Donne, 315 W. 36th St. Information: +1-212-226-0573;
 http://www.dieudonne.org .  Stroll over to gastropub  Albert Hall Tavern  for a plate of
plump Blue Points and a frosty pint of draft Weinhenstephan
beer. Order a side of duck fat and truffle oil French fries.  508 9th Ave. Information: +1-646-490-4803.  Saturday Matinee  The real stars of “War Horse” are the equine puppets,
constructed from cane, aluminum, leather and mesh, yet strong
enough to hold a rider. Three puppeteers control the head, heart
and hind of each remarkably-constructed steed.  The play explores the strong bond between human beings and
animals, as country boy Albert’s adored horse, Joey, is sold to
the cavalry at the start of World War I.  A bereft Albert, played by Seth Numrich, goes searching
among the barbed wire and carnage to find Joey and bring him
home.  For two years, the play has been reducing capacity crowds
in  London ’s West End to sodden, weeping masses, so bring
Kleenex.  In previews at Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 W. 65th St.,
Lincoln Center, opening April 14. Information: +1-212-362-7600;

and writer, but you may not be fully cognizant of his banjo-
playing chops.  He carried the instrument onstage during his early stand-up
years, often making fun of his fondness for plucking. When
Martin released an all-music album, “The Crow: New Songs for
the 5-String Banjo,” it won a Grammy last year.  You can catch him performing live with the  Steep Canyon
Rangers  at the  Music Hall  of Williamburg.  66 N. 6th St.,  Brooklyn . Information:
 http://www.musichallofwilliamsburg.com .  Sunday  In 1912,  Pablo Picasso  picked up cardboard, string and wire
and, coaxing them into the shape of a guitar, created a new form
of sculpture.  A couple of years later, he reimagined the guitar in sheet
metal.  You can see the two breakthrough works, along with 70
related paintings, collages and drawings at the  Museum of Modern
Art .  For another slant on beautiful instruments, go uptown to
the Met for “Guitar Heroes,” where you can admire “The
Rawlins,” built by Antonio Stradivari in 1700.  When Italians started migrating to  New York , luthiers took
their traditions and craft with them, building highly prized
stringed instruments in their adopted city. Many of the finest
are on show here.  “Picasso: Guitars 1912-1914” runs through June 6 at the
Museum of  Modern Art , 11 W. 53rd St. Information: +1-212-708-
9400;  http://www.moma.org .  “Guitar Heroes” on view through July 4 at the  Metropolitan Museum  of Art, 1000 Fifth Avenue at E. 82nd St.
Information: +1-212-535-7710;  http://www.metmuseum.org .  Sunday Evening  Kodo Drummers  take over  Avery Fisher Hall  to pound out
complex and subtle rhythms on their traditional Japanese
instruments.  They will be joined by fue and shamisen players, as well as
dancers and singers. Celebrating their 30th anniversary, the
group performs as part of  Carnegie Hall’s JapanNYC  festival.    Carnegie Hall  is proceeding with the events scheduled for
March and April “to pay tribute to  Japan  and its people”
during this devastating time.  Avery Fisher Hall,  Lincoln Center , Columbus Ave. at 65th
St. Information: +1-212-875-5030;
