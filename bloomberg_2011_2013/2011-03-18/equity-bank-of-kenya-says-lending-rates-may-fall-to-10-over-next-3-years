Lending rates in  Kenya , East
Africa’s biggest economy, may decline to 10 percent in three
years, from about 15 percent now, said  Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK)  Chief
Executive Officer James Mwangi.  Commercial bank rates will probably decline due to improved
economic conditions, competition among lenders, longer loans and
use of credit reference bureau information, Mwangi told
investors today in Nairobi, the capital.  While the central bank has cut its benchmark rate eight
times since 2008 to 5.75 percent, this has failed to persuade
lenders to significantly lower credit costs. Kenyan banks’
average lending rate dipped to 14.03 percent in January,
compared with a deposit rate of 3.43 percent. Equity Bank is the
country’s biggest lender by market value.  “The information credit bureaus are collecting will be
necessary as it will profile risk status of our clients and low-
risk borrowers will access credit at a lower  interest rates ,”
Mwangi said.  The reference bureau was started last year to give
commercial banks access to the credit record of potential
customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
