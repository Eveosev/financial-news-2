Coffee sales for the new crop in
Indonesia, the world’s third-largest producer of robusta beans,
accelerated in response to  London  prices, European coffee
brokers said.  Robusta coffee prices have climbed 25 percent on NYSE Liffe
in London this year. Beans for May delivery gained 0.2 percent
to $2,620 a metric ton at 2:35 p.m. local time, after earlier
today reaching a three-year high of $2,672.  “First new crop pickings are sold immediately due to the
strong performance of Liffe,” Hamburg-based broker  Eugen Atte
GmbH  said in an e-mailed report yesterday. Total deliveries from
the new crop are “much higher and earlier” than in previous
years, Dutch trader  Nedcoffee BV , which has offices in
Indonesia, said in an e-mailed report.  Shipments from Lampung totaled 18,500 tons in February,
while deliveries to exporters amounted to 10,900 tons in the
same period, confirming exporters have shipped stocks, Nedcoffee
said in the report. Stockpiles in warehouses of exporters in
Bandar Lampung were about 57,400 tons at the end of the month,
according to Nedcoffee estimates.    Indonesia ’s coffee production may fall 20 percent to
272,000 tons in 2011, Atte estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
