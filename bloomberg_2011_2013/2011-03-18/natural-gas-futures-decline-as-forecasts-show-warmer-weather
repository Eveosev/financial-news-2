Natural gas futures were little
changed in New York as forecasts showed milder weather, reducing
demand for the heating fuel.  Gas retreated from a six-week high as forecasters including
Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland , said
temperatures will be above normal in the U.S. East and Midwest
through March 22. Gas inventories were 1.4 percent above the
five-year average in the week ended March 11, according to the
Energy Department.  “It seems the weather is going to be pretty mild,” said
Brad Florer, a trader at Kottke Associates Inc., an energy
trading firm in Louisville,  Kentucky . “Once gas gets above $4,
it’s difficult to get too far away from that $4 level.”  Natural gas for April delivery slid 0.1 cent to $4.157 per
million British thermal units at 12:22 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures yesterday rose to the highest
settlement price since Feb. 4. Gas has gained 6.5 percent this
week.  The futures earlier touched $4.198 per million Btu,
climbing above the 200-day moving average of $4.1949 after
surpassing the 50-day and 100-day averages yesterday.  A momentum indicator known as MACD, or moving average
convergence/divergence, suggests gas futures may rise next week,
according to  Chris Kostas , a senior analyst at Energy Security
Analysis Inc. in Wakefield, Massachusetts.  Gas may move up to “the $4.40 and $4.50 range in the short
term,” he said.  Mild Weather  The high temperature in Chicago on March 21 will be 63
degrees Fahrenheit (17 Celsius), 14 degrees above normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  The weather may turn to colder in the Northeast from March
23 to March 27, according to Commodity Weather Group.  Gas posted its biggest percentage gain since July 15
yesterday after the Energy Department reported an inventory
decline that was larger than analysts had forecast.    Japan , the world’s biggest importer of liquefied natural
gas, is increasing demand for the fuel to replace damaged
nuclear capacity.    Korea Gas Corp. (036460)  will divert 400,000 to 500,000 metric tons
of the fuel to Japan starting the end of March, the nation’s
energy ministry said in an e-mailed statement today. Japan will
borrow the gas and return it later, according to the statement.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  supplied two LNG cargoes to Japan
from  Brunei  in the past 24 hours, according to the company.  LNG imports to the U.S. this year will be the equivalent of
1.15 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas, about 1.7 percent
of total gas demand, according Energy Department estimates made
before the earthquake.  To contact the reporters on this story:
