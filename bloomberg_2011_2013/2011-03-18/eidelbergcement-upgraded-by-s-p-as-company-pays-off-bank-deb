  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI)  had its  credit
rating  raised one notch by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services,
which cited attempts at a “meaningful reduction” in debt.  The rating has moved to BB, with a positive outlook, from
BB-, S&P said today in a statement. That’s two notches short of
investment grade.  While HeidelbergCement’s main U.S. and western European
markets may not see a recovery, S&P expects the German company
to continue to generate sustainable operating  cash flow , said
Sabine Gromer, an analyst at S&P. The cement maker should be
able to pass on most of the cost of higher raw materials to
customers. It cut long-term bank debt 69 percent to 935.7
million euros (1.32 billion euros) in 2010.  Cash flow and “management’s maintenance of prudent
spending on acquisitions and shareholder remuneration, should
translate into a further meaningful reduction in debt over the
next 12 months,” Gromer said.  The trajectory of HeidelbergCement’s credit rating
contrasts with that of  Lafarge SA (LG) ’s. The world’s biggest cement
maker had its rating cut to junk by S&P. Suffering from a
construction slump and a debt-fueled acquisition, Paris-based
Lafarge was downgraded by one level to BB+, with a stable
outlook, from BBB-. Its “credit metrics” haven’t improved in
line with expectations, S&P said in a statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
