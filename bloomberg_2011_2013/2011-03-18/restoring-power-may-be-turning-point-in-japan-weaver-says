David Weaver, professor of nuclear
physics at Birmingham University, comments on the outlook for  Japan ’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi atomic plant as workers try to
restore power to cooling systems. He made the remarks in a
telephone interview today.  “Clearly what they’ve got to try to do is keep all the
fuel in reactors and ponds cool. Restoring power will be a
turning point in that it will make it easier to use the pumps.
But whether the tsunami damaged the pumps I don’t know. Being
able to pump water is a particularly high priority.  “There is no certainty that this will easily be brought
back under control. It’s possible that trying to cool things
down will release more hydrogen,” which caused explosions
before. “On the other hand, my reading on the radiation is that
they wouldn’t be putting in bigger teams if the doses were too
high.  “They will cool it down, but it will take months and years
to clean up, and we’re not at the stage of cleaning up yet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
