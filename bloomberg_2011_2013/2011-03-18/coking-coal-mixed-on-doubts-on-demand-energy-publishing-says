Coking coal prices on the U.S. spot
market were mixed on doubts about demand following natural
disasters in  Australia  and  Japan , Energy Publishing Inc. said.  Spot prices for low-volatility coking coal fell 70 cents to
$320.55 a ton in the week ended today, according to the
 Knoxville, Tennessee-based  data provider. High-volatility coal
was unchanged at $270.  “As the market deals with the twin upsets of the terrible
flooding in Australia and the horrendous events in Japan,
participants are getting and sending mixed signals,” Energy
Publishing said.  The data provider says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
