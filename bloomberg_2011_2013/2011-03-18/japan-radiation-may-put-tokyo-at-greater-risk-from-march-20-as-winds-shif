  Tokyo  may be at greater risk from
radiation from the damaged Fukushima nuclear reactors from March
20, after shifting winds follow rain in the region of the plant
and carry radionuclides into the city.  Austria’s Meteorological and Geophysics Center made the
forecast on its website using radionuclide data from the
 Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty Organization . Radiation has been
detected as far away as eastern  Russia  at levels that pose no
risk to human health, the center said.  “On Sunday, a frontal system is crossing the region with
heavy rain,” the center said in a  statement . “Behind the
front, northerly winds are predicted, increasing the risk for
the region around Tokyo.”  Radiation plume images posted on the website show intense
radionuclide concentrations around the reactors. Wind currents
take the plume in a winding pattern over the  Pacific Ocean ,
setting the particles adrift in north- and south-easterly
patterns.  The Vienna-based CTBTO was set up in 1996 to detect
nuclear-test explosions. Its monitoring system has 63 operating
radionuclide centers around the world, including two located at  Japan ’s Atomic Research Institute in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
