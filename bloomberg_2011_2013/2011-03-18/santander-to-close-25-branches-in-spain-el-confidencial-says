  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  will close 25
branches in  Spain  as business volumes decline in the country,  El
Confidencial  said, citing unidentified people at the bank.  The offices, which represent less than 1 percent of
Santanderâ€™s network of branches, is significant because it is
the first time in nine years that the bank has reduced the
number of branches, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
