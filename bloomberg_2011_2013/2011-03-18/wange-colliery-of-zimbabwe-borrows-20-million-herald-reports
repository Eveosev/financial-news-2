Hwange Colliery Co. borrowed $20
million from the  Development Bank  of Southern Africa and another
unidentified lender, the  Herald  reported, without saying where
it got the information.  Hwange, Zimbabweâ€™s biggest coal miner, will use the funds
to resume mining operations and buy equipment, the Harare-based
newspaper said today. The company said last year it was seeking
$175 million to rehabilitate old equipment, the Herald said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
