  SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI)  and KeyCorp,
regional U.S. lenders that accepted taxpayer-funded bailouts,
raised a total of about $1.67 billion through share sales as
they prepare to repay the government.  SunTrust sold 35.3 million shares of common stock for
$29.50 each to raise $1.04 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Cleveland-based KeyCorp, Ohio’s second-biggest bank, sold
70.6 million shares of common stock at $8.85 each, raising
$625 million, the company said March 18 in a statement.  The  Federal Reserve  last week cleared some of the 19
largest U.S. banks to boost dividends, buy back shares or repay
government aid after finding “significant improvement” in
their capital and the economy. The announcement allows more
banks to repurchase preferred shares sold to the Treasury
Department in 2008 as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.  “This is a very constructive step in a healthy rebuilding
process in the financial-services industry,”  Michael Holland ,
who oversees more than $4 billion as chairman of New York-based
Holland & Co. LLC, said in an interview. “To some extent the
Fed can pat itself on the back because we are coming out of a
nasty period.”  SunTrust advanced $1.34, or 4.7 percent, to $29.59 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading on March 18 before the
announcement.  KeyCorp (KEY)  rose 7 cents to $8.92. Both banks are
little changed this year.  TARP Repayment  The Fed didn’t object to SunTrust’s capital plan to sell
the stock and issue a further $1 billion of debt, the Atlanta-
based bank said in a statement on March 18. The TARP repayment,
which also will draw on “other available funds,” is subject to
approval by the Treasury, the company said.  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) , Morgan Stanley and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey led the
bank’s offering.  KeyCorp said its proposal to triple the quarterly dividend
to 3 cents a share starting in the second quarter didn’t draw
criticism from the Fed. The company’s board is set to consider
the increase in May.    Morgan Stanley (MS)  was capital adviser for the KeyCorp stock
offering and a joint book runner with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
