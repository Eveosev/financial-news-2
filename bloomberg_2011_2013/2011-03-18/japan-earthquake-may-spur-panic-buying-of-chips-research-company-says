Electronics makers are rushing to
secure supplies of semiconductors and components after last
week’s earthquake in Japan forced companies including  Toshiba
Corp. (6502)  and  Sony Corp. (6758)  to shut plants, a research company said.  “Many electronic original equipment manufacturers
worldwide could be engaging in panic buying of semiconductors
and electronic components,” IHS iSuppli said today in an e-
mailed report. Some distributors have reported “a surge in
orders” from customers that are anticipating supply disruptions,
the company said.  The magnitude-9 earthquake, Japan’s strongest on record,
and ensuing tsunami that struck on March 11 damaged plants and
disrupted power supply, causing companies including Toshiba,
Sony and  Fujitsu Ltd. (6702)  to halt production of components used in
mobile phones and personal computers.  Japan is the leading maker of silicon, the main material in
chip manufacturing, and has 130 semiconductor-fabrication
production lines in 53 locations, according to IHS iSuppli.
Suppliers that have halted production are unlikely to resume
until the risk of more earthquakes recedes, the company said.    Apple Inc. (AAPL)  may face logistical difficulties and supply
shortages for components in its iPad 2 tablet, as five parts of
the device are made in Japan and could be affected by the
disaster, IHS iSuppli said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
