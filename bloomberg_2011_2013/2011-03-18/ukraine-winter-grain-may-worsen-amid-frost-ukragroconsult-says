The condition of winter grain in
Ukraine “may be a bit worse than official estimates” as cold
weather increases the risk of crop losses, UkrAgroConsult said.  Some fields in the Sumy, Zaporyzhzhya, Vinnytsya, Kherson
and Mykolayiv regions may show winter grain losses of as much as
15 percent after temperatures fell to below 20 degrees Celsius
(minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit) in February, the researcher said in
e-mailed statement today.  While the negative effect of frost has been observed
locally, the overall condition of winter grain is good, Kiev,
Ukraine-based UkrAgroConsult said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
