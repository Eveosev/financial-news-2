Colombia’s peso rose for a second
day after the country’s credit rating was boosted to investment
grade by  Standard & Poor’s  and central bank policy makers
increased the benchmark interest rate.  The peso gained 0.3 percent to 1,874.01 per  U.S. dollar  at
2:45 p.m. New York time, from 1,879.93 yesterday. The currency
dropped 0.2 percent this week.  “Investment-grade generates confidence in the country and
its economy,” said Daniel Velandia, head analyst at Bogota-
based brokerage Correval SA. “You can expect flows to come in
because of it.”  S&P increased Colombia’s foreign debt rating one level on
March 16 to BBB-, the lowest level of investment grade, citing a
“favorable” growth outlook and “resilient” economy. The
central bank lifted the overnight lending rate by a quarter
percentage point to 3.5 percent today, matching the median
forecast of 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Velandia predicts the key rate will rise to 4.25 percent by
year-end.  The yield on the Colombian government’s benchmark 11
percent bonds due July 2020 fell 1 basis point to 8.14 percent,
according to  Colombia ’s stock exchange. The price climbed 0.068
centavo to 118.133 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
