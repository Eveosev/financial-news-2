  Japan ’s vice finance minister said
Group of Seven nations agreed that further coordinated
intervention in currency markets was possible, after they
stepped into currency markets for the first time since 2000.  The group “made clear that it would come to the help of
Japan,” the minister, Fumihiko Igarashi said in an interview in
Tokyo today. When asked whether more intervention could be
conducted, he said “We confirmed that.”  Igarashi said he hoped the currency intervention will help
set a floor for the dollar-yen rate, and also said that an
abrupt weakening of the currency could exacerbate the nation’s
debt burden.  To contact the reporters on this story:
