  Kenya  Electricity Generating Co.,
the East African nation’s biggest power producer, was rated
“hold” in new coverage at Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd.  The brokerage, based in the capital, Nairobi, has
“positive expectations” for electricity demand growth, analyst
Suki Muia said in an e-mailed statement today. That, coupled
with Kenya Electricity’s dominant share of the industry, gives
it “strong footholds” in the long term, Muia wrote.  Kestrel put a price estimate of 16.65 shillings on the
stock, Muia said from Nairobi today. Shares in KenGen, as the
company is known, fell for a second day, losing 0.7 percent to
14.75 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi.  KenGen controls 75 percent of total installed electricity
capacity in Kenya, Kestrel said. The company’s share of sales is
expected to rise to 70 percent in the financial year through
June from 54 percent last year on improved efficiency and power
generation, Muia wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
