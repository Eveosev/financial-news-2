  Spain ’s decision to cut subsidies
for existing photovoltaic plants is jeopardizing the European
Union’s renewable energy targets, two EU officials said.  The country’s cap on the number of hours when solar
generators can earn above-market rates adds to the perceived
risk of investing in renewable generation, Energy Commissioner
Guenther Oettinger and Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard
said in a Feb. 22 letter, obtained by Bloomberg News, that sent
to the Spanish government.  “Without stability and predictability, there will be more
risk of delays,” the commissioners wrote to Industry Minister
Miguel Sebastian. “You must not forget that the negative
consequences for investors’ confidence from retroactive changes
in the economic conditions of one type of renewable facility may
spread and produce similar effects for other types of facility
in other countries.”  The Spanish government resumed talks this month with solar
industry executives over ways to soften the effect of a new
subsidy program that will cut revenue for most plants by about
30 percent. Industry lawyers have said they may sue the state
for as much as 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in lost income.  The Spanish government told the EU that it doesn’t consider
the subsidy cuts retroactive because the value of the payments
per kilowatt hour remains the same, a spokeswoman for the
Industry Ministry said. The number of hours that the subsidy can
be earned is in line with the forecasts for solar energy
production in the government’s renewable energy plan, she said,
asking not to be identified in line with government policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
