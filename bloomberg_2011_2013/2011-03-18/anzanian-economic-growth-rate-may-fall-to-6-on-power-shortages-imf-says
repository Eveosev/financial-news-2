Economic growth in  Tanzania , East
Africa’s second biggest economy, will probably slow to 6 percent
this year from 7 percent in 2010 due to power shortages, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  The rate of expansion may return to 7 percent by the end of
the year if the government plans to boost electricity succeed
and weather conditions improve, Martine Guerguil, the
Washington-based institution’s mission chief for Tanzania told
reporters in  Dar es Salaam , the commercial capital.  “The government said they are investing in energy projects
designed to give quick results,” she said.  A prolonged drought has cut electricity from hydropower
plants resulting in a deficit of 264 megawatts, Energy and
Minerals Minister William Ngeleja said on Feb. 16. The shortfall
may force some factories to close, according to the
Confederation of Tanzania Industries.  The government must guard against a lasting acceleration in
inflation due to higher food and fuel prices and should move to
reduce its fiscal deficit, the IMF said.  Annual inflation accelerated to 6.4 percent in January from
5.6 percent a month earlier, according to the country’s
statistics agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
