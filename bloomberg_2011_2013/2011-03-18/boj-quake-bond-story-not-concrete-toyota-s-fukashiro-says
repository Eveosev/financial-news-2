Jun Fukashiro, a money manager at
Toyota Asset Management Co. in Tokyo, comments on a newspaper
report that  Japan ’s government plans to issue more than 10
trillion yen ($122 billion) in earthquake restoration bonds and
the Bank of Japan will probably buy all of them.  “We are in a situation that is likely to spawn such an
idea that the government would sell restoration bonds and the
BOJ would buy them. Still, the BOJ’s underwriting of  government
bonds  is forbidden by law. Since Economic and Fiscal Policy
Minister  Kaoru Yosano  denied the report, the plan doesn’t seem
to have taken a concrete form.  “It looks like the plan appeared out of the confusion
created in the aftermath of the earthquake. There doesn’t seem
to have been a sufficient debate between the ruling and
opposition parties.”  “There is some concern about the possible purchase in the
market but the plan hasn’t been seriously priced in. Should the
market factor it in in earnest, that would spur a bond sell-off
and yields won’t stay at the current levels.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
