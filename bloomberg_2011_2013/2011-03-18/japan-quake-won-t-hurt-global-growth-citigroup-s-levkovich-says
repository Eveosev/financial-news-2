The world economy will continue to
grow even as the worst earthquake on record in Japan causes
“modest supply disruptions,” according to  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s
Tobias Levkovich.  “It’s obviously horrible and tragic, yet it’s probably not
disruptive to global GDP,” Levkovich said on Bloomberg
Television’s “InBusiness” in an interview with Margaret Brennan.  Levkovich joins Bank of America Corp. in saying lost
production in the world’s third-largest economy may not be
enough to spur a recession. While the 9-magnitude earthquake and
resulting crisis at a nuclear plant north of Tokyo have added to
investor concerns such as violence in Libya and  Europe ’s debt
crisis, the supply disruption would be “modest” and won’t
stall the fastest global economic growth since 2007, Levkovich
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
