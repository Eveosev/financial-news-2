  South Korea ’s won rose the most in
six weeks as the Group of Seven nations agreed to help Japan
curb a rally in the yen following the devastating earthquake,
the ensuing tsunami and nuclear crisis.  The won gained as the yen slumped 3.6 percent after
reaching the strongest since World War II yesterday. South
Korea’s benchmark  Kospi index (KOSPI)  of stocks advanced 1.1 percent.
“At the request of the Japanese authorities, the U.S., the U.K.,
Canada, and the  European Central Bank  will join with Japan on
March 18 in concerted intervention in exchange markets,” said a
statement from the G-7 released today.  “Markets are reacting positively to the intervention news
and signs of support from the G-7 is reassuring investors,”
said  Brian Jackson , an emerging-markets strategist at Royal Bank
of Canada in Hong Kong. “We see risk appetite coming back, not
just in the currencies but in equities as well.”  The won rose 0.8 percent to 1,126.65 per dollar as of 3 p.m.
in Seoul, the biggest daily gain since Feb. 2, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency reached a two-month low of
1,144 yesterday. The won dropped 0.2 percent for the week,
completing its second straight five-day loss.  South Korea’s three-year government bonds climbed this week.
The yield on the 3 percent note due December 2013 slid four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.67 percent,
according to prices from Korea Stock Exchange. The rate was
little changed from yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
