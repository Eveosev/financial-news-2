Coffee prices have surged in the
past year because of speculation that threatens to hurt demand,
said  Howard Schultz , the chief executive officer of  Starbucks
Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s largest coffee chain.  “Financial speculation has stepped into the market,”
creating prices that are “artificial,” Schultz said today at
an industry conference in New Orleans. “In the long run, I
don’t think consumers will respond positively to rising
prices.”  New York coffee futures have doubled in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
