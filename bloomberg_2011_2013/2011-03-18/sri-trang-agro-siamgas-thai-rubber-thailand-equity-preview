Industry Pcl (CPI)   added 1.5 percent to 4.08 baht, the
largest increase since Jan. 14.  Palm oil in Malaysia advanced, tracking a surge in soybeans
on concern that rain in  Brazil  will damage the oilseed crop, and
as crude jumped on continued unrest in Libya. The most-active
June-delivery contract gained as much as 2.8 percent to 3,453
ringgit ($1,130) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives

publicly traded rubber producer, climbed 1 percent to 26.25 baht.
Rubber in Tokyo climbed as a weaker yen made prices denominated
in the Japanese currency more attractive and Asian producers
said that they may curb shipments. The August-delivery contract
rose for a third day, rallying as much as 7.2 percent to 425.5
yen per kilogram ($5,199 per metric ton) and settled at 408.6
yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
