Michael S. Barr, the former U.S.
Treasury Department assistant secretary for financial
institutions, said he isn’t interested in becoming director of
the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  “I had a wonderful two years in Washington. I am happy to
be where I am,” Barr said today at a conference of the  Consumer
Federation of America  in Washington.  Barr left Treasury in November to return to work as a law
professor at the  University of Michigan . He has frequently been
mentioned in press reports as a top candidate for CFPB director.  Barr, who helped design and pass the 2010 Dodd-Frank
financial regulatory overhaul, defended the new agency against
critics in his speech.  “Their logic rests on the premise that empowering
consumers is somehow antithetical to free markets,” Barr said.
“In fact, the opposite is true.”  Barr also criticized what he called “collective amnesia”
about the financial crisis that has led some members of Congress
to push for reductions in the budgets of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
and the consumer bureau.  “People kind of forgot we had it, forgot why we had it,
forgot why we had to fix it and are ready to go back to what we
were doing before,” Barr said. “And I think that’s really
dangerous for the country.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
