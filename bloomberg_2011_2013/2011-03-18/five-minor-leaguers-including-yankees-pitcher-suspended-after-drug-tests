Eliseo Batista of the  New York
Yankees  was one of five minor-league pitchers given 50-game
suspensions after failing tests for performance-enhancing drugs.  Batista, Ruben Mejia of the San Diego Padres, Jose Williams
of the Cincinnati Reds, and Marcos Coca and Daniel DelaCruz of
the  Philadelphia Phillies  were suspended for violating doping
rules, according to a news release today from the office of
Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig.  All five suspensions will be effective at the start of the
Dominican Summer League season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
