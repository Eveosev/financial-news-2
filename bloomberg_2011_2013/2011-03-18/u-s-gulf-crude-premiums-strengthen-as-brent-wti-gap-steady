U.S. Gulf crude premiums
strengthened versus West  Texas  Intermediate as Brent oil’s
premium to the U.S. benchmark held steady at around $12 a
barrel. The spread has narrowed in four of the past six days.  The gap between May-delivery futures for WTI and for Brent,
its European counterpart, narrowed 35 cents to $12.18 a barrel
at 1:14 p.m. in  New York . The differential for the contract
nearest to expiration reached a record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against Brent.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI strengthened 25
cents to $15.45 a barrel at 12:12 p.m. in New York, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium
widened 10 cents to $15.65.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend
gained 70 cents to $10.45 a barrel over the benchmark.
Poseidon’s premium was unchanged at $10.50.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium increased 50 cents to $9 a
barrel. Thunder Horse’s premium weakened 40 cents to $12.10 a
barrel over WTI.  West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 15 cents to $3.50 a
barrel. WTS is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less
influenced by imports.  Syncrude’s premium was unchanged at $12.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta . The discount for Western Canada Select
remained at $19.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
