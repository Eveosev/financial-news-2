  Michael Parker , an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in  Hong Kong , comments on efforts by
Tokyo Electric Power Co. to restore power to the cooling systems
of reactors at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant in northern
Japan.  He spoke in a phone interview today. He doesn’t rate shares
of Tokyo Electric Power.  “The issue with laying 1 kilometer of cable to reconnect
isn’t that problematical. The question is whether the pumping
and cooling equipment will still work once that cable is
connected. There have been explosions, earthquakes and tsunamis
that could have affected the equipment’s ability to operate even
if power is restored.”  --Edmond Lococo. Editors: Michael Tighe, Neil Denslow.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
