Gulf Keystone Resources Plc, the
U.K. oil explorer focusing on  Iraq , gained the most in 19 months
in  London  after reporting a “significant” initial oil flow at
the Shaikan-2 appraisal well in Kurdistan.  Gulf rose 31 percent to 161.75 pence, the biggest gain
since August 2009. The stock has almost doubled in the last
year.  Shaikan-2 is the first deep appraisal well drilled on the
Shaikan field and is located about nine kilometers (5.6 miles)
to the southeast of the Shaikan-1 discovery well, the company
said in a statement. More tests will be required in the next 72
hours to measure the flow rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
