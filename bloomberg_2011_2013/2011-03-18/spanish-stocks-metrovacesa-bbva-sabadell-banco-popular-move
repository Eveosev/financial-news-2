  Spain â€™s IBEX 35 index advanced
82.8, or 0.8 percent, to 10,408.4 at 2:58 p.m. in Madrid. The
gauge is little changed this week, gaining less than 0.1
percent. The Madrid Stock Exchange General Index gained 0.7
percent today.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Spanish market. Symbols are in parentheses after company names.    Befesa Medio Ambiente SA (BMA)   soared 6.4 percent to
25.65 euros to the highest since Sept. 2008.  Abengoa SA (ABG)  , which owns 97.4 percent of the industrial waste-treatment
company, said it would offer to buy out remaining shareholders
at 26 euros a share. Abengoa advanced 0.5 percent to 22.51
euros.    Metrovacesa SA (MVC)   jumped 19.4 percent to 7.63 euros,
the biggest increase in more than 18 months. The third-largest
Spanish property company reached an agreement on a 3.2 billion-
euro ($4.5 billion) loan refinancing with most creditors, enough
for a U.K. court-administered debt reorganization in which the
majority of lenders prevail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
