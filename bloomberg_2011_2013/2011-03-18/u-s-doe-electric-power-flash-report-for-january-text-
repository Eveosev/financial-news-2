The following is the text of the
Electric Power Flash report from the U.S. Department of Energy:  The contiguous  United States  as a whole experienced temperatures
that were below normal in January 2011.  Accordingly, the total
population-weighted heating degree days for the United States
were 4.3 percent above the January normal.  Retail sales of electricity increased 1.8 percent from January
2010.  Over the same period, the average U.S. retail price of
electricity increased 2.9 percent.  For the 12-month period
ending January 2011, the average U.S. retail price of
electricity increased 1.1 percent over the previous 12-month
period ending January 2010.  In January 2011, total electric power generation in the United
States increased 0.5 percent compared to January 2010 (the
change in electric power generation does not necessarily
coincide with the change in retail sales of electricity because
utility billing cycles tend to lag electricity production in
many areas).  Over the same period, coal generation decreased
1.4 percent, while natural gas generation decreased 0.6 percent.
Petroleum liquids generation had the largest percentage change,
decreasing 42.0 percent due in part to the increased cost of
petroleum liquids as a fuel used in electricity generation.
Conventional hydroelectric generation increased 16.3 percent
from the previous year, mainly due to dryer conditions observed
in the Northwest in January 2011 that led to an early snowmelt
in the region.  Consistent with the year-over-year increase in coal generation,
the consumption of coal to produce electricity decreased 0.7
percent.  Over the same period, natural gas consumption
decreased 1.0 percent, while petroleum liquids consumption
decreased 42.1 percent when compared to January 2010.  Total coal stocks decreased 5.8 percent from the previous month.
Accordingly, the average number of days of burn for coal plants
consuming bituminous or subbituminous coal as their primary fuel
exhibited a similar decrease from the previous month.  SOURCE: U.S. Department of Energy
