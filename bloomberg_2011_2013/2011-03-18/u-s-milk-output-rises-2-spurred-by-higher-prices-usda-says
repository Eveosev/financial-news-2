U.S. milk production climbed 2
percent in February as rising prices spurred dairy farmers
to increase herds and boost per-cow output, according to
the Department of Agriculture.  Production climbed to 15.055 billion pounds (6.83
billion kilograms) from 14.758 billion in February 2010,
the USDA said today in a  report . The dairy herd totaled
9.16 million head last month, up 0.7 percent from a year
earlier, while the average cow produced 1,644 pounds of
milk, up 1.3 percent, the department said.  “There is a strong underlying desire to get as much
milk as possible from each cow with prices rising,” said
Bill Brooks, a  Kansas City , Kansas-based economist with
INTL FCStone. “We should see the growth in milk per cow
increase the next three months as new cows are added to the
herd and fresh forage supplies become available.”  Class III milk futures reached a 32-month high of
$19.65 per 100 pounds on March 11 as domestic dairy-product
demand rose and exports of butter and powdered milk
increased. Milk for March delivery fell 8 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $19.47 at 12:50 p.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile
Exchange. Before today, the commodity rose 57 percent in
the past year.  The  average price  farmers will get for all milk this
year will be $18.40 per 100 pounds, up from an estimated
$16.29 in 2010, the USDA said last week. The price averaged
$12.83 in 2009. Production this year will rise 1.7 percent
to 196 billion pounds, the government said.  Whole milk at the supermarket averaged $3.357 a gallon
(3.8 liters) in February, up 4.8 percent from a year
earlier and the highest since January 2009, the Bureau of
Labor Statistics said this week.  Average retail cheddar-cheese prices fell 2.3 percent
to $5.023 a pound last month, from a record $5.143 in
January, government statistics show.  Rising demand from  Asia  has helped to boost U.S.
exports. Dairy-product shipments rose 39 percent to 1.603
million metric tons in 2010 from a year earlier,  USDA data 
show. Cheese exports rose 60 percent to 173,531 tons, and
dry milk shipments rose 55 percent to 384,104 tons.  Dairy product exports climbed 49 percent to 138,186
tons in January from 93,043 tons a year earlier, according
to the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
