Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) , which
completed the purchase of  AirTran Holdings Inc. (AAI)  this month,
plans to end the smaller carrier’s flights to six Midwest cities
operated under an agreement with  SkyWest Inc. (SKYW)   Southwest’s pilot contract doesn’t allow for such so-called
code-share flying in the U.S., Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said today. Southwest has had talks with SkyWest and
hasn’t given a termination notice, Kelly said after the
airline’s annual meeting at its Dallas headquarters.  The affected cities are Des Moines, Iowa; Omaha, Nebraska;
St. Louis; Akron-Canton, Ohio; Indianapolis; and Pittsburgh, and
most flights are performed with regional jets to and from the
Milwaukee hub, AirTran President Bob Jordan said.  Southwest serves some of the cities, such as Omaha, on its
own and hopes to keep flying to all of them, although it hasn’t
yet determined routes, schedules or plane types, Kelly said.
Omaha is home to Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , whose
MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. unit is based in Des Moines.  “We will try to sustain service in places like Des Moines
even when we shut down SkyWest,” Kelly said.  SkyWest, based in  St. George , Utah, had no immediate
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
