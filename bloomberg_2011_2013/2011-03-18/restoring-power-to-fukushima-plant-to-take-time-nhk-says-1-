Restoring power to two of the
reactors at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s stricken Fukushima
nuclear power plant may “take time,” NHK reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The company is trying to use a transmission line originally
used to take power away from the plant to bring it back to
reactors No. 3 and 4, NHK said.  “It may take more time before they’re able to use external
power,” the state-run broadcaster said.  A new power cable that aims to bring power to reactors No.
1 and 2 has been laid as far as the power plant, the report
said. If the company is able to bring that within the structure,
power could be restored to those reactors as early as today, it
said.  Tokyo Electric is trying restore power to the plant’s
cooling systems, which were knocked out by the earthquake and
tsunami.    Kyodo News  quoted Tokyo Electric Managing Director Akio Komori telling a news conference in Fukushima today that the
company was “desperately” trying every possible step to
restore power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
