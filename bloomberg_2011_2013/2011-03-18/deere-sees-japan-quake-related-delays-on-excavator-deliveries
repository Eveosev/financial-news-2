  Deere & Co. (DE) , the world’s largest
farm equipment maker, expects deliveries of some excavators and
mining equipment will be delayed in the aftermath of the
earthquake and tsunami that struck  Japan  last week.  “Although some suppliers are recovering from the
disruptions caused by last week’s events, present conditions in
Japan make it difficult to estimate the full effects on the
supply chain,” the Moline, Illinois-based company said today in
a securities filing. “It is too early to estimate the impact on
Deere’s overall business.”
​     The delays may be for some excavators sold under both the
Deere and Hitachi Ltd. brand names, and mining equipment under
the Hitachi brand, the company said in the filing.  Deere and Hitachi have a manufacturing and marketing
agreement that includes the Deere-Hitachi joint venture in
Kernersville,  North Carolina , company spokesman Ken Golden said
in an e-mailed response to questions. Deere is also responsible
for marketing and selling excavators and some other equipment
for both brands in the Americas, he said.  “Clearly, there is some stress from production in Japan,
but Deere’s core business appears to be relatively unaffected,”
Larry De Maria, a New York-based analyst for Sterne Agee & Leach
Inc. who rates Deere shares a “buy,” said in a telephone
interview.    Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the world’s largest construction-
equipment maker, said in a statement today that while the
situation in Japan is having some impact on production, it
hasn’t stopped output at other plants around the world.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Shruti Singh  in Chicago at
