Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
lowered Bahrain’s short- and long-term sovereign credit ratings
by two levels, citing increasing political tensions in the
Persian Gulf country.  S&P cut Bahrain’s long-term local and foreign currency
sovereign credit ratings to BBB, the second-lowest investment
grade, and the short-term ratings to A-3, the fourth-lowest. The
country may be downgraded further, S&P said.  Bahrainis are gathering in the village of Sitra today to
mourn the death of a protester, a day after security forces
arrested opposition leaders and accused them of having ties with
foreign countries. The government declared a three-month state
of emergency on March 15, after troops from  Saudi Arabia  and
other Gulf states arrived to help.  “The heightened political turmoil is damaging Bahrain’s
economic model,” S&P analyst Mike Noone said in an e-mailed
report. “The Bahraini government has attempted to restore order
by inviting the deployment of Gulf Cooperation Council forces,
but this has angered Bahrain’s Shia population and has been
heavily criticized by  Iran .”  Fitch ratings cut Bahrain’s credit rating by two levels on
March 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
