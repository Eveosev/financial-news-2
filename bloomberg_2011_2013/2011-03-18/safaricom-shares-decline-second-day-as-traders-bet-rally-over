  Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) , East Africa’s
biggest mobile-phone company, retreated for a second day as some
investors bet a rally in the company’s shares has run its
course.  East Africa’s biggest company by market value fell 10
cents, or 2.4 percent, to 4 shillings by 2:29 p.m. in Nairobi.  “There is an element of profit-taking because it has
rallied up quite a bit,” Eric Musau, an analyst at African
Alliance Securities Kenya Ltd., said in a phone interview from
Nairobi.  The stock reached 3.6 shillings on March 3. its lowest
intraday level this year and the weakest since October 2009.
Year-to-date, the stock has declined 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
