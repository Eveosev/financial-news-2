New Japanese nuclear plants are
“impossible to think about” until the crisis unfolding at the
Dai-Ichi reactors in Fukushima is resolved, Chief Cabinet
Secretary Yukio Edano said in a televised address today.  There is “no doubt” emergency workers were able to
replenish water in the No. 3 reactor pool at the  Tokyo  Electric
Power Co. plant, he said. Japanese soldiers and firefighters
from Tokyo, using dozens of fire engines, have doused sea water
on reactor No. 3, the site of an explosion earlier this week.  Personnel may resume efforts to refill the No. 3 reactor
pool, he said, and attempts to connect power to the plant are
ongoing.  Tokyo Electric is planning rolling blackouts in  Japan  for
the next three days, Edano said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
