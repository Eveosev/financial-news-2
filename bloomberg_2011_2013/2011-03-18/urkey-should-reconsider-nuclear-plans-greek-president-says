Greek President Karolos Papoulias
urged neighboring  Turkey  to reconsider plans to build atomic
power stations after a March 11 earthquake and tsunami damaged
Japan’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant.  “It’s impossible at this time, when we have this disaster
at the nuclear reactors in Japan that has shocked us all, that
Turkey should want to build in an earthquake zone,” Papoulias
said during a visit to a satellite station, according to an e-
mailed transcript of his comments from his office in  Athens .  Countries including China and Germany put nuclear-power
development on hold after the earthquake and tsunami damaged the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, 135 miles (217 kilometers) north of
Tokyo, resulting in fires, explosions and radiation leaks.  Turkey wants to build two atomic-power plants, one near the
town of Sinop on the Black Sea coast and the second at Akuyyu,
25 kilometers from a seismic fault line. Greece and Turkey are
the two most seismically active nations in  Europe .  Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  should think
this over “many times” and “the Europeans should intervene to
prevent a disaster that would be in our own backyard, at our own
doorstep,” Papoulias said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
