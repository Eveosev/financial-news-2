Topiary Capital Ltd.’s $200 million
of catastrophe bonds, series 2008-1, were put on credit watch
with negative implications after the company provided a so-
called activation notice linked to  Japan ’s March 11 earthquake,  Standard & Poor’s  said in a statement.      The notice was submitted to Risk Management Solutions, S&P
said today. If RMS determines the earthquake is an activation
event, “noteholders will be at risk for losses of principal and
interest for subsequent covered events that occur from March 11
through July 31,” S&P said.   Catastrophe bonds, sold by insurers and reinsurers and
bought by investors who lose money if they’re triggered, dropped
1.6 percent this week, according to the Swiss Re Cat Bond Total
Return Index.   Topiary Capital’s securities are rated BB+, S&P said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
