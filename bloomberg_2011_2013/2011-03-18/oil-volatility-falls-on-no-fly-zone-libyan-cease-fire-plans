Oil options volatility decreased as
the underlying futures fluctuated after  Libya  said it would halt
military action against rebels and the  United Nations  approved a
no-fly zone over  Africa â€™s third-largest oil producer.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 37.25 percent as of 3:30 p.m. in New
York, down from 39.45 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for April delivery dropped 35 cents to settle at
$101.07 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures
were up as much as 2.2 percent to $103.66 before the Libyan
announcement.  May $130 calls were the most active options in electronic

contract, lost 31 cents to 96 cents a barrel with 1,620
contracts trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of oil.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
