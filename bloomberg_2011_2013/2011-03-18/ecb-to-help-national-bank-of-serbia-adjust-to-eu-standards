The  European Central Bank  launched
a two-year technical assistance program today to help the
Serbian central bank adjust to European Union standards as the
country strives to become an EU member.  The program, to run through January 2013 with a help of a
resident coordinator, is “another step forward in strengthening
cooperation between central banks in  Europe , with the wider aim
of fostering monetary and financial stability, as well as closer
ties between the EU and the Republic of Serbia,” the ECB said in
a statement. The aim of the program is to help the National Bank
of Serbia “to prepare strategies, internal policies and
economic models that meet the standards applied by central banks
in the EU,” it said.  ECB Executive Board member Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell and
Dejan Soskic, the governor of the National Bank of  Serbia ,
signed the pact.  Serbia expects Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule to
arrive in Belgrade on Oct. 12 with the European Commission’s
opinion on whether the Balkan state of 7.3 million people is fit
to become an EU-member candidate and get a date for the start of
membership talks. Belgrade still needs to improve Serbia’s
judicial system and intensify the fight against organized crime
and corruption for more progress on its path to the EU.  The ECB program will focus on financial sector supervision,
legal harmonisation, liberalisation of capital movements,
foreign exchange reserve management, monetary and exchange rate
operations, financial services consumer protection, EU accession
support, economic analysis and research, statistics, payment
systems and financial stability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
