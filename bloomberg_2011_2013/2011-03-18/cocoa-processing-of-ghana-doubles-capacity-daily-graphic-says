Cocoa Processing Co., a Ghanaian
chocolate maker, opened a 10.5 million cedi ($6.9 million) plant
in the West African nation to more than double its processing
capacity, the  Daily Graphic  reported.  The company is now able to process 64,500 metric tons of
cocoa a year, up from about 25,000 tons, the Accra-based
newspaper said, citing Managing Director Richard Amarh Tetteh.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
