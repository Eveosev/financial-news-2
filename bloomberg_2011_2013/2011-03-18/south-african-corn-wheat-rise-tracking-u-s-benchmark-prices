Corn and wheat prices in  South
Africa  advanced by the maximum daily limit set by the South
African Futures Exchange as prices gained in the U.S., which
competes for African export markets.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract on
the  South African Futures Exchange , rose 80 rand, or 5.3
percent, to close trade at 1,595 rand ($227) a metric ton,
taking its weekly advance to 3.4 percent. Meal made from the
grain is the country’s staple food.  “It’s because of Chicago prices,” Thys Claassens, an
analyst at Kroonstad, South Africa-based Corn International,
said. “The markets have recovered after the earthquake and
tsunami in  Japan .”  Corn for May delivery gained as much as 5.2 percent to
$6.80 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, adding to
yesterday’s 4.9 percent jump, as importer demand for U.S. grain
surged, spurred by the plunge in prices following the earthquake
in Japan, the world’s largest importer of corn.  Yellow corn for July delivery gained 80 rand, or 5.1
percent, to 1,649 rand a ton. The grain, used mainly for  animal
feed  in  South Africa , rose 3.6 percent in the week.  Wheat for July delivery increased 100 rand, or 3.3
percent, to 3,095 rand a ton. The grain jumped 3.1 percent
during the week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
