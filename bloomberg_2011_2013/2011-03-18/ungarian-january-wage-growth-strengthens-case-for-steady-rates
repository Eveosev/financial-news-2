Hungarian gross annual wages rose
less than economists forecast in January, strengthening the case
for the central bank to keep the benchmark interest rate
unchanged for a second month.  The average monthly gross wage rose 1.6 percent to 210,239
forint ($1,082), after falling 4.6 percent in December, the most
since January 2009, the Budapest-based  statistics office  said in
a statement today. The median estimate of seven analysts in a
Bloomberg survey was for wage growth of 2.4 percent.    Hungary ’s central bank kept its main interest rate
unchanged in February at 6 percent after three consecutive
months of increases as inflation slowed, wages dropped and
investors’ risk assessment of the country improved.  Magyar
Nemzeti Bank  policy makers raised the rate by 0.75 percentage
point since November citing accelerating price growth.  The inflation rate in February rose to 4.1 percent from 4
percent in January, adding to arguments to leave  interest rates 
unchanged when policy makers meet on March 28.  Public wages dropped 12.5 percent in January while salaries
at private companies rose 8.4 percent. Regular private wages
excluding bonuses, one of the  central bank’s  most closely
watched indicators for determining inflation expectations, rose
an annual 4.3 percent in January after increasing 3 percent in
December.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
