  Morgan Stanley (MS) , the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, said it will proceed with plans to purchase
the portion of the Smith Barney brokerage business it doesn’t
already own after regulators reviewed its financial strength.  “The firm is comfortable with the results of the  Federal
Reserve ’s Capital Plan Review and our capital position,” said
Mark Lake, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, in an e-mail
today. “As previously stated, our capital allocation priorities
are the continued investment in our businesses and purchasing
the rest of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.” The statement had no
reference to dividends or share repurchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
