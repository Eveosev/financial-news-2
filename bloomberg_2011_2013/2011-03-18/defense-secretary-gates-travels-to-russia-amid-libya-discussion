Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  has
delayed his long-planned trip  Russia , scheduled to begin today,
to monitor the situation in Libya as allies began military
action against Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi, Defense Department
spokesman Geoff Morrell said.  Gates had planned to hold talks with President  Dmitry Medvedev  and Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov on
issues including missile defense, arms control, Afghanistan and
Iran, the Pentagon said.  French warplanes today attacked forces loyal to Qaddafi
after the regime scorned international calls for a cease-fire
and assaulted the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. The United
Nations Security Council voted March 17 to authorize a no-fly
zone and other military action against Libya.  Gates’s visit had been scheduled with a stop in  St.
Petersburg  tomorrow and the next day before Gates was to head to
Moscow on March 22. Morrell didn’t specify how long the trip
would be delayed.  President Barack Obama has made it a priority to mend
relations with Russian leaders, which fell to their lowest point
since the Cold War in the aftermath of Russia’s 2008 invasion of
the former Soviet republic of Georgia. Gates has said he plans
to leave office this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
