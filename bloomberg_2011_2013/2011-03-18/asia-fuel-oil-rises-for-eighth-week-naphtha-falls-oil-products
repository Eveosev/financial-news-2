Asia  fuel oil  rose for the eighth
week, the longest gaining streak since 2007, after a March 11
earthquake in Japan damaged nuclear  power plants . Gasoil
refining margins gained while those for naphtha fell.  Fuel Oil  Asian benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil rose 0.4 percent
this week to $652.25 a metric ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That capped the longest streak since the eight weeks
ended April 13, 2007. The price of 380-centistoke fuel oil,
mainly used as marine fuel, rose 0.4 percent to $637 a ton.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, or the crack spread,
fell 71 cents, or 8.8 percent, to $8.80 a barrel this week,
Bloomberg data showed.    Japan ’s demand for fuel oil may rise as utilities use more
of the fuel to replace lost nuclear capacity following the March
11 earthquake, according to Credit Agricole SA.  Singapore’s stockpiles of residues, or fuel oil, declined
for the third week, a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry
said yesterday. Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel
oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, fell 2.3
percent to 18.5 million barrels in the seven days to March 16,
the longest losing streak since the three weeks to Jan. 6.  Engineers plan to work into the night to restore power to
two of the crippled reactors at Japan’s damaged Fukushima Dai-
Ichi power plant. Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  described the crisis
as “very grave.”  BP Plc sold 20,000 tons of 180-centistoke fuel oil loading
April 5 to April 9 to Vitol Group at a premium of $4 a ton over
benchmark prices.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to Japan fell 0.3
percent to $980.75 a ton, Bloomberg data showed. The premium of
Japan-delivered naphtha to Brent, or the crack spread, declined
to $109.67 a ton from $124.15 a ton at the end of Asian trading
on March 11, Bloomberg data showed.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline rose 1 percent to $119.85 a
barrel this week. Gasoline’s premium to naphtha widened $1.40 to
$12.50 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. A wider reforming margin
means the profit from turning naphtha into gasoline is
increasing.  People moving away from Japan’s damaged Fukushima nuclear
plant may push up gasoline imports this month amid supply curbs
from refinery outages.  Japan’s gasoline consumption will climb by 80,000 barrels a
day in March as the number of people traveling by car rises,  Christophe Barret , London-based oil analyst at Credit Agricole
SA, said in a report today.  ConocoPhillips sold 50,000 barrels of 97-RON gasoline
loading April 2 to April 6 to Royal Dutch Shell Plc at $123.20 a
barrel. Total SA sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON loading the same
period to Trafigura Beheer BV at $119.90 a barrel.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur, climbed 3.3
percent this week to $133.50 a barrel. Jet fuel rose 3.1 percent
to $134.75 a barrel.  The premium of gasoil to Dubai crude, a measure of refining
profit for the fuel, rose 97 cents, or 4.3 percent to $23.58 a
barrel, Bloomberg data showed. The crack spread surged to $24.09
a barrel on March 16, the widest since Sept. 26, 2008, as
refinery outages in Japan led to shortages.  PetroChina Co. plans to ship 220,000 metric tons of fuel to
Japan to aid disaster recovery following the earthquake,
President Zhou Jiping said in  Hong Kong  yesterday.  Shell sold 165,000 barrels of jet fuel loading April 8 to
April 12 to Glencore International AG at a premium of 20 cents
over benchmark prices.  Shell bought 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 10-parts-per-
million of sulfur from Vitol at a premium of $4.60 a barrel over
prices of the 0.5 percent sulfur gasoil grade published by
Platts. The cargo was for loading April 2 to April 6.  Refinery News  Cosmo Oil Co., a Japanese refiner partly owned by  Abu
Dhabi , plans to boost processing rates at its other plants to
make up a shortfall after its Chiba facility was shut by a fire
caused by the earthquake. Cosmo plans to boost processing runs
at its Yokkaichi facility by 50,000 barrels a day and at the
Sakaide refinery by 30,000 barrels, the company said in a
statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
