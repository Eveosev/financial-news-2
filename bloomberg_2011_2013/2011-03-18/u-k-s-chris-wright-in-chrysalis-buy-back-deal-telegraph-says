Veteran U.K. music industry
entrepreneur Chris Wright bought back a unit of  Chrysalis Group
Plc (CHS)  only weeks after selling the group he founded to a company
owned by  KKR & Co LP (KKR)  for 107 million pounds ($173 million), the
Daily Telegraph reported, citing people familiar with the deal.  Wright joined forces with Peter Lassman, head of Lasgo
Chrysalis, to buy back the unit, which specialises in wholesale
entertainment distribution; Lassman and Wright will each hold 35
percent in Lasgo Chrysalis, with three other executives holding
10 percent each, the newspaper said.  The Telegraph didn’t give a price for the deal.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
