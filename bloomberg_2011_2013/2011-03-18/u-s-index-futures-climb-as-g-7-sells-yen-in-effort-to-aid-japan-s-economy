U.S. stocks advanced, paring a
weekly decline, as the  Federal Reserve  cleared the way for
lenders to boost dividends, Libya announced a cease-fire and
central banks worked to support Japan’s economy.  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  of 24 companies rallied 1.1 percent as

the New York-based chief equity market strategist at Federated
Investors Inc., which manages $341.3 billion. “The Fed is
saying what investors want to hear. It’s allowing banks to
create value to shareholders. In addition to that, we have
positive news on the international front,” he said. “People
will be moving back aggressively into stocks as soon as we get
more clarity about Japan’s nuclear situation and the
geopolitical unrest.”  Lowest Valuation  The S&P 500 has fallen 4.8 percent from its 32-month high
in February on concern Japan’s worst earthquake and surging oil
prices will hurt the global economic recovery. The index had a
three-day slump through March 16, sending the S&P 500 to the
lowest valuation since November at 14.7 reported earnings,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The S&P 500 Financials Index gained 1.1 percent, the
biggest rally among 10 industries, as 68 of its 81 stocks rose.  The Fed said some of the 19 largest U.S. banks will be able
to restart dividend payments, buy back shares or repay
government capital after “significant improvement” in their
capital positions and the economy.    JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the second-largest U.S. bank by
assets, raised its quarterly payout to 25 cents a share from 5
cents and authorized a $15 billion stock buyback.  Wells Fargo &
Co. (WFC)  authorized the repurchase of 200 million shares and a

at the height of the 2008 financial crisis and won approval from
the Fed for a dividend increase and buyback.  Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares rallied 0.9 percent to
$83.48.  Crude oil fell as Libya said it’s ceasing all military
action and will start talks with the opposition, bolstering
chances of a resolution to the conflict that has cut shipments
from the country. Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa made the
announcement in a televised news conference carried by Al
Arabiya TV.  In Japan, the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rallied 2.7 percent,
paring its worst weekly performance since 2008. The Group of
Seven nations jointly intervened in the foreign exchange market
for the first time in more than a decade after Japan’s currency
soared, threatening its recovery from the March 11 earthquake.
G-7 finance chiefs said in a joint statement after a conference
call they will “provide any needed cooperation” with Japan.  ‘Good News’  “We’ve put some money to work,” said Michael Mullaney,
who manages $9.5 billion at Fiduciary Trust Co. in Boston.
“There’s good news coming out of Libya because, of course, you
don’t want to see a United States intervention. It’s also nice
to see the coordination among the G-7 nations because a stronger
yen is not in the best interest of the Japanese as they are
restarting their economy.”  Caterpillar rose 1.9 percent to $105.06. The largest maker
of construction equipment said February retail sales of machines
jumped 59 percent worldwide for the three-month rolling period
compared with the same months the prior year. The information
was disclosed in a regulatory filing.    Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  rallied 0.8 percent to $17.14. The

investors after the shares fell 35 percent in the past year. The
dividend will be paid April 20 to shareholders of record on
March 31.  Nike Tumbles  Nike retreated 9.2 percent to $77.59. The world’s largest
sporting goods company reported profit that missed analysts’
estimates for the first time in 19 straight quarters, amid
higher costs. Net income rose to $1.08 a share in the third
quarter ended Feb. 28, the company said yesterday in a
statement. That compared with the $1.12 average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors who were optimistic before the crisis at Japan’s
nuclear plant should stick with their outlook and buy U.S.
equities as earnings expand, even after the biggest surge in
volatility since May, according to UBS AG.  “Market volatility should come down,”  Jonathan Golub ,
chief U.S. equity strategist at UBS, said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop with Betty Liu.” “If you
were optimistic before, looking at the fact that employment’s
getting better, manufacturing’s getting better and the stock
market is cheaper, I’d be a buyer at the current level.”  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, soared as much as 46 percent at the beginning of
this week for the biggest three-day gain since May. It fell 7.3
percent to 24.44 today. Golub said the volatility jump isn’t a
reason to change investment outlooks because fundamentals remain
intact.  To contact the reporter on this story:
