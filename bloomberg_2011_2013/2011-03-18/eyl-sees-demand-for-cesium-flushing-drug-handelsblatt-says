Heyl Chemisch-pharmazeutische
Fabrik GmbH , a privately held German drugmaker, is seeing rising
demand for its cesium-flushing drug Radiogardase in the wake of
the Japanese nuclear crisis,  Handelsblatt  reported.  The company sent two shipments of the drug to  Japan  and
expects a third order shortly, the newspaper said. Berlin-based
Heyl, which manufactures a number of drugs to help the human
body rid itself of radioactive materials, has annual sales of
about 20 million euros ($28 million), Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
