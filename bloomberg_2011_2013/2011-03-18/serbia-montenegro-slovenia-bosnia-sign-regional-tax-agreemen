Tax authorities of  Serbia ,  Montenegro , Slovenia and both parts of Bosnia signed a regional
cooperation agreement to clamp down on tax evasion and the grey
economy.  The former communist Yugoslav republics still need to
increase control of the grey economy, which flourished during
the 1990s amid wars and international sanctions. Slovenia is the
only former member of the defunct Yugoslav federation to join
the European Union, while Serbia and Montenegro are looking for
closer ties to the bloc and eventual membership.  Slovenia “wants to gain more access to data on its
businesses operating in the region,” Serbian Tax Administration
spokesman Zoran Jovanovic in an interview.  The four countries are struggling to put their public
finances in order and cut budget deficits, which expanded during
the global recession.    Tax-evasion  cost Serbia at least $217.42 million last year,
Jovanovic said, and the effect of tax-payment and corporate
contribution is damaging the budget, Jovanovic said. Tax
authorities are focusing on fighting evasion of value-added tax
payments, a main source of budget revenue, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
