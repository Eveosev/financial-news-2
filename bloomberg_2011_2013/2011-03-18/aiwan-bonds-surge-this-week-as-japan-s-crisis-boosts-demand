  Taiwan ’s bonds gained this week,
with 10-year yields declining the most in a year, as Japan’s
earthquake and nuclear crisis bolstered demand for the relative
safety of government debt.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares plunged 4.7
percent this week following the March 11 quake, which caused a
tsunami that killed thousands and led to radiation leaks at a
nuclear power plant north of  Tokyo . Taiwan’s debt dropped today
as the Group of Seven nations said they will jointly intervene
in the foreign-exchange market after the yen rose to its
strongest level since World War II yesterday.  “Taiwan bonds have been supported this week by Japan’s
earthquake and nuclear risk,” said Eric Hsing, a debt trader at
First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “Sentiment was lifted today
due to cooperation from developed markets to restore stability”
in  Japan ’s currency, he said.  The yield on the 1.375 percent note due March 2021, the
most traded government debt, dropped six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.34 percent this week, according to Gretai
Securities Market. That’s the biggest weekly decline in the rate
for a benchmark 10-year bond since March 2010. The yield climbed
two basis points today.  Taiwan’s dollar was little changed this week and fell 0.1
percent today to NT$29.60 against its U.S. counterpart as of the
4 p.m. local time close, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency reached NT$29.647 yesterday, the weakest level since
March 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
