U.S. nuclear-power output rose for
the fourth day after American Electric Power Co. started the
Donald C. Cook 1 reactor in Michigan, the  Nuclear Regulatory
Commission  said.  Production nationwide increased by 382 megawatts, or 0.4
percent, from yesterday to 87,543 megawatts, or 86 percent of
capacity, according to a report today from the NRC and data
compiled by Bloomberg. Fourteen of the nation’s 104 reactors
were offline.  American Electric’s 1,060-megawatt Donald C. Cook 1 reactor
was operating at 28 percent of capacity. The plant is located on
the eastern shore of  Lake Michigan , 26 miles (42 kilometers)
northwest of South Bend, Indiana. The 1,009-megawatt Cook 2,
another unit at the site, is operating at full power.  Constellation Nuclear Energy Group LLC , a joint venture of  Constellation Energy Group Inc. (CEG)  and Electricite de France SA,
boosted its 867-megawatt Calvert Cliffs 2 reactor in  Maryland  to
95 percent of capacity from 83 percent yesterday.  Another reactor at the plant, the 867-megawatt Calvert
Cliffs 1, is operating at full power. The plant is located 38
miles (61 kilometers) south of Annapolis.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
