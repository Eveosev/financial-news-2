Samsung Electronics Co., the
world’s largest maker of televisions and memory chips, forecast
that  Japan ’s worst earthquake on record and higher  oil prices 
will undermine the global economic recovery this year.  That will probably prevent the electronics industry from
experiencing much of an improvement in 2011, Samsung Electronics
Chief Executive Officer Choi Gee Sung said during the company’s
annual shareholders’ meeting in  Seoul  today. Samsung will
continue to boost sales and profit by cutting production costs
and developing premium products, Choi said.  Japanese companies may take as long as three months to
restart their factories following last week’s earthquake and
ensuing tsunami that crippled the nation, according to research
firm IHS ISuppli. Oil surged in New York trading after the  United Nations Security Council  voted to ground Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s air force, renewing concerns that unrest in
the region may spread and disrupt supply.  “Because of the impact of oil prices at $100 and the
aftermath of the earthquake in Japan, both advanced and emerging
economies will decline,” Choi said.  Samsung shares fell 0.2 percent to 888,000 won as of 9:45
a.m., while the Kospi index gained 0.6 percent.  The Suwon, South Korea-based company, which posted record
profit last year, plans to bolster market-share leads and expand
in future-growth businesses such as software and medical-
equipment business, the company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
