German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
said that the international community will monitor Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s announcement of a cease-fire for any signs of
“tricks.”  Merkel, speaking to reporters in Berlin today after the
United Nations Security Council voted to authorize the use of
force to protect Libyan civilians, said that she will attend a
meeting in Paris tomorrow on the situation in Libya.  Germany 
abstained in the UN vote last night.  “We share the aims of this resolution,” Merkel said.
“Don’t confuse our abstention with neutrality” on the issue.  While reports of a cease-fire in Libya are “encouraging,”
the international community “will observe very closely whether
this a diversionary tactic or tricks,” Merkel said. “We’re
calling for a cease-fire that is sustained, so that the war that
Qaddafi is waging on his own people comes to a rapid end.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
