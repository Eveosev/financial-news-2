  India ’s 11-year bonds fell, pushing
yields to a three-week high, after the central bank raised
borrowing costs yesterday for the eighth time in a year.  The securities headed for a weekly decline after the  Reserve Bank  of India lifted the benchmark repurchase rate to
6.75 percent from 6.5 percent. The increase was predicted by all
26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The overnight call money
rate touched a one-year high following advance tax payments by
companies prior to the March 15 deadline, which drained cash
from the banking system.  “The central bank’s tone continues to be hawkish,” said K.
Ramanathan, Mumbai-based chief investment officer at ING
Investment Management Pvt, a unit of the largest Dutch financial
services company. “I expect the liquidity tightness to continue
as it is part of the RBI’s policy objective.”  The yield on the 8.08 percent bond due August 2022, the
most-traded government debt, rose three basis points to 8.11
percent, the highest level since Feb. 25, as of 10:06 a.m. in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate
advanced five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
