  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ,
whose fees to advisers have exceeded $1.2 billion during its
bankruptcy, paid its lawyers and managers $30.1 million in
February.  Restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal LLC, whose co-founder
Bryan Marsal runs the defunct investment bank, has made $412.7
million in “interim management” fees for 29 1/2 months of
work, including $9.2 million last month, according to the filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, based in  New York , collected
$279.9 million for acting as Lehman’s lead bankruptcy law firm
through February, including $7.8 million last month.  A fee committee that oversees the defunct firm’s payments
to advisers said March 11 it was seeking power to object to
monthly fee applications. Charges should be “reasonable, actual
and necessary,” the overseer said in a court filing.  Lehman and its affiliates reported cash and investments of
$22.6 billion on Feb. 28, compared with $22.5 billion on Jan.
31. About $3.9 billion of its cash is restricted, or not
available for use.  Once the world’s fourth-biggest investment bank, Lehman
aims to get approval for a $61 billion liquidation plan by Nov.
17. Creditors include  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  UBS AG (UBSN) , the New
York Giants and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, as well as
individuals who hold Lehman bonds.  Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history on
Sept. 15, 2008, with assets of $639 billion.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
