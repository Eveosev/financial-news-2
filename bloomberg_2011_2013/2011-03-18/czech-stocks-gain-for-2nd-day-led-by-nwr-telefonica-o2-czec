Czech equities gained for a second
day, led by  New World Resources NV (NWR)  and  CEZ AS (CEZ) , as coal and power
prices rose in Europe and the Group of Seven nations agreed to
sell the yen to ease concern  Japan  will sink into recession.  The PX gauge rose as much as 0.5 percent and traded up 0.3
percent at 1,210.6 as of 11 a.m. in Prague. CEZ, the biggest
Czech power utility that has a 25 percent weighting in the
index, rose for a fourth day, adding 0.4 percent to 828 koruna.
Coal producer NWR jumped 1.5 percent to 275.9 koruna.  European stocks and U.S. index futures rose after Japan’s
Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said each of the G-7 members
will sell yen as their markets open. The currency’s strength
threatens to hamper the recovery of the world’s third-biggest
economy from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  Electricity for delivery next year has risen 7.2 percent so
far this week in  Germany  and benchmark European coal derivatives
have added 4.9 percent in the period after  Chancellor Angela
Merkel  said on March 15 the country’s seven oldest reactors will
stay off line for three months following Japan’s nuclear crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
