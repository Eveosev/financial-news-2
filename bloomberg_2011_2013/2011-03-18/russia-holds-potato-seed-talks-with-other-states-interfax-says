Viktor Zubkov,  Russia ’s first
deputy prime minister, said he’s holding talks with foreign
countries about supplying potato seeds to aid planting in the
former Soviet nation, Interfax reported.  Norway and Hungary agreed to help with seeds, and talks
with  Canada  and the Netherlands are expected on March 21, the
news agency cited Zubkov as saying. He didn’t specify the amount
of seeds the European countries agreed to provide, according to
Interfax. Russia lacks 300,000 metric tons of potato seeds this
year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
