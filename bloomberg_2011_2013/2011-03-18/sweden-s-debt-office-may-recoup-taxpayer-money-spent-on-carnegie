The Swedish National Debt Office
said it will probably recoup taxpayer money and make a “slight
profit” from the takeover of failed broker D. Carnegie & Co as
the current owners now plan to sell off real estate assets.  Altor Equity Partners AB and  Bure Equity AB (BURE)  have decided to
start the sales process of the real estate company Norrvidden
AB. The government is guaranteed to receive 90 percent of the
profit from the sale, the debt office said today in a  statement .  Carnegie took over Norrvidden when the debt office owned
the bank. The debt office later sold the group to the two
Swedish private equity companies. It seized Carnegie in November
2008 to recoup central bank loans after Sweden’s financial
watchdog revoked Carnegie’s banking license.  The original sales price the government and the taxpayer
received did not fully cover the costs of the takeover, the debt
office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
