  BC Partners  Ltd., the private
equity firm that owns Fitness First, agreed to buy U.K. mobile
phone retailer Phones 4u from Providence Equity Partners LLC.  The transaction is expected to be completed in April, the
buyout firms said in a joint statement today. The deal values
the company at 600 million pounds ($966 million) to 700 million
pounds, said a person with knowledge of the matter, who declined
to be identified because the terms are private.  “With its market-leading position, strong and trusted
brand, multi-format strategy and extensive store network, Phones
4u is ideally positioned to benefit from further strong growth
in the smart-phone market,” Andrew Newington, managing partner
at BC Partners, said in the statement.  Providence purchased Phones 4u from U.K. billionaire John Caudwell in 2006. The Staffordshire, England-based company
supplies all major network and handset brands in more than 500
stores in the U.K., the firm said today.  BC Partners is investing the remainder of its 5.8 billion-
euro ($8.2 billion) fund raised in 2005, while seeking a new
pool of similar size. The private equity firm, which has so far
secured 4 billion euros from investors for its new fund, is in
talks to buy a controlling stake in Italian clothing retailer
Gruppo Coin SpA.  BC Partners was advised by Goldman Sachs Inc. and Global
Leisure Partners Ltd. on Phones 4u. Providence was advised by
Deutsche Bank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
