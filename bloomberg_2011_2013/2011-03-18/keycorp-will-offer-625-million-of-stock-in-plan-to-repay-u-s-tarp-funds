  KeyCorp. (KEY) ,  Ohio ’s second-biggest
bank, said it is selling $625 million in stock and also issuing
debt to help repay a U.S. bailout after a Federal Reserve review
of the company’s capital strength.  “Proceeds from both offerings, together with other
available funds, will be used to repurchase” preferred shares
issued to the U.S. as part of its rescue, the Cleveland-based
lender said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
