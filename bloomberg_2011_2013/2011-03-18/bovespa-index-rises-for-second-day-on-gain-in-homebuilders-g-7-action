The Bovespa stock index rose for a
second day, erasing its weekly loss, as homebuilders rallied and
the Group of Seven nations acted to support Japan’s economy,
leading stocks worldwide to climb.    Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3)  jumped to the highest price since
January after newspaper  Valor Economico  reported competitor  Even
Construtora e Incorporadora SA (EVEN3)  is in takeover talks and Rossi is
the most likely buyer.  Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4)  advanced the
most in one week, leading gains for banks, as traders pared bets
for higher borrowing costs.  The Bovespa climbed 1 percent to 66,879.89 at the close of
Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time. The gauge advanced

ended Sept. 17. Fifty-two stocks rose on the index, while 17

dollar .  “Today there were no signs that the Japan crisis may
worsen,” said Renato Bandeira de Mello, head of equity at
Futura Corretora brokerage in  Sao Paulo . “At this point, this
alone is already good news, as all investor concern is about how
the global economy will react to the disaster.”  Homebuilder Deal  Even jumped 1.2 percent to 8.15 reais, the highest price
since Jan. 26. Rossi gained 2.3 percent to 14.01 reais. Even is
in advanced talks to sell control, Valor Economico reported,
without saying where it got the information. The company denied
the report in a statement today.  An acquisition by Rossi would create  Brazil ’s fourth-
largest homebuilder, behind PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos &
Participacoes, MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA and Cyrela
Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes, Brazil’s
biggest homebuilder by revenue, Valor said.  The G-7 jointly intervened in the foreign exchange market
for the first time since 2000 after  Japan ’s currency soared,
threatening its recovery from last week’s temblor and ensuing
tsunami. Japan began the effort, with the New York Federal
Reserve Bank and  Europe ’s central banks following up in their
markets, sending the currency down the most against the dollar
since 2008.  Stocks worldwide also extended gains after  Libya  called a
cease-fire and said it will start talks with rebels.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rallied 2.7 percent, paring
its worst weekly performance since 2008. The  S&P 500 index 
gained 0.4 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index increased 0.2
percent to 267.63 after climbing 1 percent earlier.  Gol Gains  Power may be restored to one of the crippled reactors the

surpassing  Tam SA (TAMM4)  as Brazil’s market leader in domestic flights.
Gol had 39.8 percent of domestic market share in February, while
Tam had 39.6 percent, according to an e-mailed statement from
the country’s aviation authority, ANAC. Tam kept its lead of the
international market, with 85.9 percent. Gol had 12.9 percent.  Tam Falls  Tam fell 3.8 percent to 31.85 reais, the lowest since price

homebuilders and banks retreated on concern rising inflation

outweighing gains in oil and raw-material producers.  The index trades at 10.5 times analysts’ earnings
