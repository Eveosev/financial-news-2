Wheat production in Germany, the
European Union’s second-largest grower after  France , is set to
rise 2.6 percent this year on higher yields as the barley crop
slides, Deutscher Raiffeisenverband e.V. said.  Farmers will harvest 24.68 million metric tons of wheat, up
from 24.05 million tons in 2010, the Berlin-based agriculture
association  said  on its website today. Overall grain production
will be little changed as barley output drops, it said.  Germany’s grain crop slumped 11 percent last year, based on
DRV estimates, after rain flooded fields and delayed the
harvest. Along with a crop-destroying drought in  Russia  and
flooding in  Canada , that helped wheat futures to jump 87 percent
in the past year in Paris trading.  “Despite the pleasingly high prices, the DRV assumes a
slightly reduced planting area,” the group said. “Difficult
sowing conditions in the autumn of 2010, an early onset of
winter as well as frost on uncovered soils in the first days of
March limit the yield potential.”  Total grain production is forecast to slide 0.1 percent to
44.23 million tons, with plantings down 1.8 percent to 6.51
million hectares (16.1 million acres), the DRV estimated. The
average yield will increase 1.7 percent to 6.79 tons a hectare,
it said.  Wheat Yields  Wheat yields will advance to 7.41 tons a hectare from 7.23
tons in 2010, while plantings for all varieties of the grain
will climb 0.1 percent to 3.33 million hectares based on the
outlook, the statement shows.  “Due to the numerous uncertainties about the further
vegetation development, the DRV assumes in its first forecast of
yields that they will only just exceed the disappointing results
of the previous year,” the group said.  Barley production probably will slide 8.4 percent to 9.54
million tons, with winter-barley output dropping 8.7 percent to
7.92 million tons, the DRV said. The planted area is forecast to
slip 5.4 percent to 1.56 million hectares, with yields falling
3.1 percent to 6.1 tons a hectare.    Germany ’s rapeseed harvest will slump 5.5 percent to 5.42
million tons, hurt by a 1.2 percent slide in plantings to 1.45
million hectares and a 4.3 percent decline in yields to 3.74
tons a hectare, the group said. The country was the largest EU
grower of the oilseed last year.  Corn production in Germany will climb 4.4 percent to 4.26
million tons based on increased planting, the DRV estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
