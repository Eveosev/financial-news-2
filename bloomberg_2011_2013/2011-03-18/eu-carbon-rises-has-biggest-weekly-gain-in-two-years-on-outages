European Union carbon permits for
December rose, posting their biggest weekly gain for two years,
after  Germany  decided to close 7 gigawatts of nuclear capacity.  Carbon allowances for December rose 2.6 percent to close at
17.22 euros ($24.41) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London . They had a weekly gain of 9.5 percent, the
biggest jump since March 2009.  Lower generation of nuclear power will require power
utilities to burn more fossil fuels, boosting emissions and
demand for permits. Japan upgraded its warning for parts of the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant from a four to a five on a seven-level
international scale, the  International Atomic Energy Agency  said
yesterday. The five rating is for accidents with wider
consequences. The worst nuclear accident, Chernobyl in 1986,
rated seven.  “The longer the situation in  Japan  remains critical, the
greater political pressure in Germany to keep the 7 gigawatts
offline,” Mark Lewis, an analyst in Paris with Deutsche Bank
AG, said today by phone. “I think it is now looking
increasingly likely that at least 1 to 2 gigawatts of the 7
gigawatts will not be brought back into service.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
