Aidan Byrne, a nuclear physicist
and dean of science at  Australian National University  in
Canberra, comments on the risk of contamination to  Japan ’s food
supply from radiation emitting from the damaged Fukushima
nuclear plant. Byrne spoke by phone today.  On the risk from radiation releases so far:  “Most of the radioactivity that would have been released
to date would be relatively short-lived activity so that’s not
going to have any long-term effect on food produced.  “If the situation calmed down now, your first pass would
be to say it will have a relatively minimal effect on
agricultural production.  “The worst-case scenario would be very bad, but that
depends on which way the wind is blowing.”  On the risk from different types of radioactive material:  “In the Chernobyl situation the material that caused most
concern was the cesium.  “We haven’t had a fire of the type, or explosion of the
type that would be required to put a lot of that material into
the atmosphere.”  On contamination risks from the tsunami:  “You are likely also to get, I would imagine, groundwater
contamination as a result of the tsunami and the chemical
contamination that you might have from that.  “First of all, the contamination by salt water is going to
cause problems but also whatever has been washed in with that
from the destruction of buildings and industrial infrastructure,
that is likely to be more concerning just at the moment, and
more concerning because it must cover an enormously big
region.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
