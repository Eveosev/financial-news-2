Michael Oxley, the former
congressman who co-wrote the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act  of 2002, has
registered as a lobbyist for the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority to promote self-regulation of investment advisers.  Oxley, a partner at Baker Hostetler LLP in  Washington ,
registered this week as a Finra lobbyist, saying he would work
on securities regulation and the “harmonization of regulation
of broker-dealers and investment advisers,” according to his
registration form. Finra oversees about 4,560 brokerage firms
and is interested in expanding to investment advisers.  Finra contends the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
should use a self-regulatory organization, or SRO, to take over
examinations of investment advisers from the agency.  A January SEC study -- mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act’s
regulatory overhaul -- suggested using SROs as an option to
increase adviser oversight. Congress hasn’t yet authorized the
SEC to make a rule.  Oxley, 67, an Ohio Republican who was chairman of the House
Financial Services Committee and is also a senior board adviser
at  NASDAQ OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) , didn’t immediately respond to a
request for comment. His March 15 lobbyist registration included
his former communications director on  Capitol Hill , Peggy Peterson, who also works at Baker.    Nancy Condon , a Finra spokeswoman, said the regulator had
no comment on Oxley’s hire.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, passed in the wake of the Enron
accounting scandal, was designed to protect investors from
fraudulent corporate accounting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
