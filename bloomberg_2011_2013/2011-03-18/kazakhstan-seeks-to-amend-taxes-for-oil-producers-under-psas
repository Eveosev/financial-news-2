  Kazakhstan , central  Asia ’s biggest
energy producer, seeks to amend tax provisions for  oil companies 
under production-sharing agreements to reflect current rates,
according to an Oil Ministry official.  “We are working with the  Finance Ministry  to cancel tax
stability in all production sharing agreements,” Oil & Gas
Ministry Secretary Kanatbek Safinov said today in an interview
in Almaty, without giving further details.  Kazakhstan, which holds 3 percent of the world’s oil
reserves according to BP Plc, signed agreements in the 1990s
that formed ventures such as  Chevron Corp (CVX) .-led TengizChevroil
LLP and Karachaganak Petroleum Operating BV, led by BG Plc and  Eni SpA (ENI) , that had favorable tax rates. In August, the country
began levying export duties on crude to boost its share of
revenue from its most valuable export, doubling the levy to $40
a metric ton ($5.46 a barrel) at the start of this year.  Kazakhstan introduced in 2009 a new  tax code  that included
a mineral extraction duty and excessive profit tax for oil
companies. President Nursultan Nazarbayev  ordered  the government
in January last year to make all tax amendments applicable to
all producers. Nazarbayev, 70, last month called snap elections
for April and scrapped a referendum on extending his 22-year
rule.  Kazakhstan would boost revenue from companies including the
Karachaganak venture if it was paying under current tax
legislation, Safinov said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
