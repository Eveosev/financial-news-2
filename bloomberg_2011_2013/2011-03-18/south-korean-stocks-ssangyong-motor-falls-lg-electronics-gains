month may be affected by disruptions of component supplies from  Japan  following the earthquake there, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.’s

Goenka said. Mahindra owns 70 percent of the South Korean
automaker.    LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  (066570 KS) gained 1.1 percent to
100,500 wo, the most in two weeks. The world’s third-largest

tablet computer in Japan this month even after the earthquake,
said Ken Hong, a Seoul-based spokesman said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
