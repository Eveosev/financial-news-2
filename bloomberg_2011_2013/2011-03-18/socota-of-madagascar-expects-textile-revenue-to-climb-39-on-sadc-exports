Groupe Socota, whose textile and
garment-making unit is Madagascar’s biggest, expects revenue
from this business to rise 39 percent in 2011 as exports to
southern  Africa  grow, Chief Executive Officer Salim Ismail said.  Revenue is forecast to increase to 63.3 million euros ($89
million) at  Socota Textiles Ltd. , Ismail said by phone from
Antsirabe, 165 kilometers (102 miles) south of Antananarivo, the
capital, on March 16.  “The Southern African Development Community markets are
growing very quickly and we have the advantage of being very
near compared to our competitors,” he said, and with southern
African experiencing summer during the European winter,
workloads at the company’s plants are more even.  Socota Textiles, which employs 4,340 people, has clients
that include  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS) , the U.K.’s largest
clothing retailer, and  Spain ’s  Inditex SA (ITX) , the world’s biggest
and owner of the Zara brand. In  South Africa , the continent’s
biggest economy, it supplies Woolworths Holdings Ltd. and Edcon
Holdings Ltd., owned by Bain Capital LLC.  The U.S. suspended Madagascar from eligibility for duty-
free exports to the U.S. through its African Growth and
Opportunity Act in 2009. The law, introduced in 2000 to help
expand economic growth on the world’s poorest continent and due
to expire in 2015, allows about 6,500 products from Africa to
enter the U.S. free of duties or quotas.  Groupe Socota, which also has interests in shrimp farming,
sought to grow textile exports to European and SADC markets
after the 2009 suspension caused by coup in March that year,
which sparked a two-year economic crisis. The European market
accounted for 76 percent of revenue in 2010, Ismail said.  Before the suspension from AGOA, Madagascar’s textile
industry accounted for  42 percent  of export earnings for the
Indian Ocean island nation, according to the  World Bank .
Madagascar’s exclusion has led to the loss of at least 20,000
formal jobs, Ismail said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
