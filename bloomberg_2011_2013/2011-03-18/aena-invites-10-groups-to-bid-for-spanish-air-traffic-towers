Aena ,  Spain ’s state-owned airport
operator, said it’s asking 10 groups to consider bidding to run
air-traffic control towers at 13 airports across Spain.  The towers are being divided into three lots, and the
service providers will be chosen within five months and will be
granted five-year contracts, which can be extended to six years,
Madrid-based Aena said in a  statement .  The companies qualified for the second stage of bidding
after showing the “technical and financial solvency” required
for the operations, Aena said.  The first lot of towers includes those at Alicante,
Valencia, Ibiza and Sabadell, while the second comprises centers
at Seville, Jerez, Vivo, A Coruna, Melilla and Cuatro Vientos,
while the third involves assets at Lanzarote, Fuerteventura and
La Palma.  Potential bidders for all three sets of towers include
Zenit Air Control SA, Ferronats Air Traffic Services, Agrupacion
Navsa-LVF, Geci Espanola, Tower Traffic Services, Etracontrol,
UTE Sacyr Concesiones/NAV  Portugal , Saerco, Servicios de Control
