  National Bank of Kenya Ltd. (NBKL) , the
state-controlled lender, was rated “buy” in new coverage at
Sterling Investment Bank Ltd.  The brokerage has a price estimate of 41 shillings on the
stock, analyst Onesmus Nzioka said in a phone interview today
from Nairobi, the capital.  “The bank has a price-earnings multiple of 9.81 times,
against the sector’s 12.13 times, indicating that it is
underpriced,” Sterling said in an e-mailed note to clients.  National Bank’s shares declined 3.7 percent to 39.5
shillings at the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, taking its two-day
drop to 9.7 percent, the biggest since the two days through Jan.
4, 2008.  The lender reported yesterday net income climbed 38 percent
to 2.02 billion shillings ($23.5 million) in the 12 months
through December, from 1.46 billion shillings a year ago. Net
interest income, the money banks make from interest charges on
loans, advanced 31 percent to 4.37 billion shillings, Chief
Executive Officer Reuben Marambii told reporters at a briefing.  “The results had been factored in way before and some
people are now exiting,” Nzioka said. “The bank failed to beat
the industry average to return a 25 percent growth in pretax
profit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
