  Brazil  and the European Union
reached an open-skies aviation agreement and will sign an accord
in June, Valor Economico newspaper reported.  The liberalization will be carried out over three years,
increasing competition, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said,
citing an interview with Bruno Dalcolmo, head of international
relations at Brazilâ€™s civil aviation agency, known as Anac.  The agreement will increase the number of flights and
cities served in Europe and Brazil, and may reduce fares, the
paper said.  After concluding negotiations in December, Brazil will also
sign today an open-skies pact with the U.S., Valor said. The
agreement will allow total liberalization of fares and
destinations by 2015, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
