Former New York Yankees manager  Joe Torre  accepted an invitation to participate for the first time
in the team’s Old-Timers’ Day this season.  “I don’t know if I’m letting the cat out of the bag, but I
was invited,” Torre told reporters last night during his first
visit to Steinbrenner Field in Tampa,  Florida , since ending
contract negotiations with the Yankees in October 2007. “I’m
planning on going.”  Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium, an annual tradition, is
scheduled for June 26.  Torre left the franchise after rejecting a one-year, $5
million offer, ending a 12-year run as Yankees manager that
included four World Series titles and playoff appearances every
year.  He then managed the  Los Angeles Dodgers  for three seasons
before becoming  Major League Baseball ’s executive vice president
of baseball operations last month.  Torre has been visiting spring training sites as part of
his new job, and said the trip back to Steinbrenner Field “does
feel strange, but it feels good.”  “It’s water under the bridge, I guess,” Torre said of his
contentious departure from the Yankees, according to audio of
his comments posted at  CBSNewYork.com . “I never would have
changed anything, to be honest with you. You wish that, the time
I left, that it could have ended differently, but I don’t know
how it could have. I don’t know if either one of us knew how to
say goodbye at that point.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
