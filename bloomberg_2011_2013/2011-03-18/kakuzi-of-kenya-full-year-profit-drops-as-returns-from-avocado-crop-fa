  Kakuzi (KKZI)  Ltd., a Kenyan tea and fruit
producer, said profit fell 8 percent as returns on its avocado
crop declined from a year earlier.  Net income dropped to 311.1 million shillings ($3.64
million) in the 12 months through December, from 339.9 million
shillings a year earlier, the Thika, Kenya-based company said in
a statement in the Daily Nation newspaper today. Revenue grew 5
percent to 2.11 billion shillings, it said.  The company said it has made a provision for a 109 million-
shilling claim by Del Monte Kenya Ltd. as an adjustment to
prior-year financial statements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
