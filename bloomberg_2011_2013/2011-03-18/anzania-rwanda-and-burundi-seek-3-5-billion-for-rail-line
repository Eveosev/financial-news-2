  Tanzania ,  Rwanda  and  Burundi  plan
to raise $3.5 billion to build a regional railway line aimed at
boosting investment in the region, Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete said.  “We are ready to borrow, preferably from concessional
sources,” he said in a speech e-mailed to reporters. “We are
ready to go into partnership with private companies that can
raise the money for construction of the railway.”  The East African countries want the project either to be on
a build-operate-transfer basis or a joint venture, he said.  Tanzania’s main port of Dar es Salaam port is closer to the
Indian Ocean for Burundi, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of
Congo than the Kenyan port of Mombasa. About 94 percent of cargo
to Burundi, 57 percent to Rwanda and 67 percent of exports from
Rwanda pass through the port of  Dar es Salaam , said Kikwete.
Cargo is currently trucked by road.  The railway would attract investment into industries
including nickel mining in Burundi and Tanzania, Kikwete said.
Feasibility studies for a section of the railway plan connecting
Tanzania to Rwanda, and then to Burundi, and rehabilitating part
of the line from Dar es Salaam port have already been completed.  The studies were funded by  African Development Bank , the
U.S. government, and Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC, according
to Kikwete’s speech.  To contact the reporter on this story:
