Rafineria Nafty Jedlicze SA , a
Polish refinery majority-owned by PKN Orlen SA, will restart
heating-oil output in early April after a halt, said Bogdan
Pawlicki, the company’s production manager.  The plant in the southeast of  Poland  has capacity to
produce 90,000 metric tons of heating oil a year and average
annual output is 50,000 tons, Pawlicki said today by telephone.
The refinery also produces solvents and regenerates used oils.  To contact the reporter on this story:
