The drought and heat wave in  Russia 
last year destroyed 13 million hectares (32.1 million acres) of
crops, Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said.  Weather-related losses to winter crops this year may reach
5 million hectares, Putin said in a video conference with farm
officials today. Sowing was 3.5 million hectares below targets
in 2010 because of dry soil, and more than 1.5 million hectares
of crops may be lost in 2011, according to the prime minister.  First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov today estimated
this yearâ€™s grain harvest at between 84 million and 85 million
metric tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
