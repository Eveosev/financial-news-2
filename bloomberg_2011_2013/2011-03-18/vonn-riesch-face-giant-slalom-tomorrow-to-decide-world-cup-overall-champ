  Lindsey Vonn  of the U.S. and  Maria Riesch  of  Germany  are separated by three points in the
overall standings with one event remaining in skiing’s World Cup
season.  A giant slalom is scheduled for tomorrow in Lenzerheide,
Switzerland. The margin between Vonn, the three-time defending
overall champion, and Riesch is small enough that whichever
skier beats the other in that race will almost certainly win the
overall title.  Riesch has 1,728 points for the season, which started
almost half a year ago. Vonn has 1,725 points.  “It simply doesn’t get tighter than this: five months,
18,000 miles, 12 countries and 20 resorts and some 50 miles of
race course, and it’s likely going to come down to hundredths of
a second,” Steve Porino, a commentator for NBC’s Universal
Sports, said in a news release. “It’s madness.”  Riesch, 26, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, took a three-
point lead over Vonn today by finishing fourth in a slalom, nine
spots ahead of the American. Vonn, 26, who has clinched
the women’s downhill title for the fourth consecutive
year, had opened a 27-point lead on Riesch in the
overall standings on March 16.  The weather may prevent tomorrow’s race from being held.
Rain and warm weather canceled the men’s giant slalom
today. If the women’s race is canceled, Riesch will win the
overall title.  With the cancellation of the men’s race, American Ted Ligety won his third  World Cup  giant slalom title. Ligety won
the combined event gold medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics in
Turin,  Italy .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
