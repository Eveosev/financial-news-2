Nuclear Power Corp. of  India  is
under “no compulsion” to buy reactors from  Areva SA (CEI)  after two
agreements signed in December, the Press Trust of India
reported, citing Chairman Shreyans Kumar Jain.  The Indian company will evaluate Areva’s 1,650-megawatt
reactors and purchase them on technically acceptable terms,
Press Trust quoted Jain as saying.  France and India signed agreements that will allow Paris-
based Areva to build two nuclear reactors for $9.3 billion at
Jaitapur and supply uranium.  The reactors need to be competitively priced when compared
with other energy sources because India doesn’t subsidize
nuclear power, according to the report.  Nuclear Power Corp. is India’s monopoly atomic generator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
