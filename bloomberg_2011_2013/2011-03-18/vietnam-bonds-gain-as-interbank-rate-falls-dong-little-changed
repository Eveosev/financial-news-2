  Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
rose on speculation a drop in interbank lending rates will make
it easier for investors to buy government debt with borrowed
funds. The dong was little changed.  Yields fell from a 10-month high reached yesterday
“following the strong decline in interbank rates, which dropped
to as low as 16 percent yesterday from 20 percent,” said Luu
Hai Yen, a Hanoi-based analyst at  Thang Long Securities Joint-
Stock Co.,  Vietnam’s biggest brokerage.  Five-year bond yields declined six basis points to 11.88
percent, the biggest drop since Feb. 18, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The rate fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, from March 11, snapping a run
of three weekly gains.  Yields are likely to rise because the government will need
to tighten monetary policy to curb accelerating inflation, Yen
said. Consumer prices will rise 1.8 percent to 2.2 percent this
month from February, according to a government forecast
published March 15. Last month’s 12.3 percent year-on-year
inflation rate was the highest since March 2009, official
figures show.  The government must prioritize curbing inflation, the
 Communist Party’s  14-member Politburo, Vietnam’s most powerful
political body, said in a statement late yesterday.  The dong was little changed from yesterday and last week at
20,868 per dollar as of 4:08 p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,663, compared with 20,658 yesterday, its
website showed. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent
on either side of the official rate.  -  Nicholas Heath . With reporting from Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi.
