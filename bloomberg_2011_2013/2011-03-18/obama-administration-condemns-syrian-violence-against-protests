The Obama administration condemned
the violence in  Syria  and called on the government there to let
peaceful demonstrations take place.  “The  United States  stands for a set of universal rights,
including the freedom of expression and assembly, and believes
that governments, including the Syrian government, must address
the legitimate aspirations of their people,” Tommy Vietor,
spokesman for President Barack Obama’s National Security
Council, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Four protesters were killed and hundreds injured by Syrian
security forces in the southern town of Daraa, the news agency  Agence France-Presse  reported, citing a human rights activist
who is in the town.  The state news agency Sana reported today that
“infiltrators” from the gathering had attacked security forces
in the town and then dispersed. The agency did not mention any
casualties. The agency also reported demonstrations in the
northern town of Baniyas. Al Jazeera television reported
protests in the cities of Tartus and Aleppo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
