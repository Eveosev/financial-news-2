Ethanol futures advanced for a
second day in  Chicago  on concern that Midwest flooding will hurt
the corn crop and raise production costs for the fuel.  The grain-based gasoline additive followed its primary
feedstock higher after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration yesterday forecast an above-average risk of
flooding for parts of the corn-rich U.S. Midwest.  “It was a crazy ride today,” said Don Salfi, a trader at
BiofuelsConnect, a Heathrow, Florida-based alternative energy
broker. “It followed the corn. Everybody started slinging.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery surged 8.2 cents, or
3.4 percent, to $2.485 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures are up 57 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago soared 11.5
cents, or 4.8 percent, to $2.49 a gallon and on the West Coast
the additive gained 10 cents, or 4 percent, to $2.59, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  added 9.5 cents, or 3.8 percent, to
$2.59 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf, the fuel rose 6 cents, or
2.4 percent, to $2.615.  Corn for May delivery jumped 37 cents, or 5.7 percent, to
$6.835 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes about 2.75 gallons
of ethanol.  An average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is losing 8 cents on every
gallon produced, while a plant in  Illinois  is pocketing about 13
cents, according to Ag Trader Talk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
