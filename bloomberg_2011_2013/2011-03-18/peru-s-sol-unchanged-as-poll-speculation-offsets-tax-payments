Peru’s sol was little changed as
speculation a presidential poll may indicate growing support for
opposition leader  Ollanta Humala  offset demand for the currency
from exporters making tax payments.  The sol ended at 2.7680 per  U.S. dollar  at the close of
trading, unchanged from yesterday. The currency fell less than
0.1 percent this week.  Researchers Ipsos Apoyo will publish a poll on March 20
that may show Humala’s chances of reaching a run-off vote with
frontrunner Alejandro Toledo are growing after polls published
earlier this month showed rising support for the former army
lieutenant and ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Humala,
48, favors more state control of the economy and the Andean
nation’s natural resources.  “Humala has been rising and that’s a risk,” said  Roberto Melzi , a Latin America strategist at Barclays Capital Inc. in  New York . “People are tuned into these developments in the
polls.”  The sol earlier touched 2.7640, its strongest level since
Feb. 11 amid a seasonal increase in companies paying local
taxes.  The central bank didn’t buy dollars in the foreign exchange
market today or issue certificates of deposit payable in
dollars.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 6.30 percent, according to Deutsche Bank
AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
