Television ratings for the first
full day of the men’s college basketball tournament were the
highest in two decades as CBS Sports and Turner Sports combined
to air all 16 games in their entirety for the first time.  The National Collegiate Athletic Association games on the  CBS Corp. (CBS)  network and  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s TBS, TNT and truTV
networks were seen in an average of 5.7 percent of households in
the top 56 U.S. television markets, CBS and Turner said in a
news release.  That’s 24 percent higher than last year’s 4.6 major-market
rating for the first Thursday of the tournament and the highest
since 1991, when it expanded to four telecast windows for the
entire day.  CBS and Turner agreed in April on a 14-year, $10.8 billion
contract for broadcast, Internet and wireless rights on the
tournament, which this year expanded to 68 teams from 65.  To contact the reporter on this story:
