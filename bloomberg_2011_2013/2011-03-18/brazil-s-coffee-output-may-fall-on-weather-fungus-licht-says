Coffee output in  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer, may decline because dry weather in
February hurt bean development and fungus has spread in some
producing areas, according to German researcher F.O. Licht.  “The dry February deprived beans of sufficient moisture to
swell out fully, keeping them from reaching the desired size,
which would effectively mean a reduction in output,” Licht said
in a report today.  Fungus has affected some crops due to be harvested in May,
the researcher said. “Although no data is available on the
actual damage at this point, agronomists agreed that the
infestation had not reached alarming levels,” it said.  Dryness may reduce this year’s output beyond a 30 percent
drop predicted in January, Marco Antonio dos Santos, a weather
forecaster at Sao Paulo-based Somar Meteorologia, said last
month. Brazilian growers may harvest 33.7 million bags of coffee
in 2011, down from 48.1 million in the prior year, Somar said
Jan. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
