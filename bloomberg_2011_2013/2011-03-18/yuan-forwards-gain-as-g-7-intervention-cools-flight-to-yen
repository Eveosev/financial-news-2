Yuan non-deliverable forwards
gained, recouping losses from earlier in the week, after the
Group of Seven nations agreed to intervene to calm  currency
markets  in the aftermath of  Japan ’s worst earthquake on record.  The Group of Seven will jointly intervene in the foreign-
exchange market for the first time in more than a decade after
Japan’s currency hit a post-World War II high yesterday,
threatening exports as the nation contends with damage from the
March 11 quake and tsunami. The yen fell the most in six months
against the dollar today.  “The markets are taking relief from the fact that the G-7
is providing support for Japan,” said  Patrick Bennett , a Hong
Kong-based strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd. “That
provides some comfort to the equity markets and Asian currencies,
including the yuan.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.12 percent to
6.4515 per dollar as of 5:15 p.m. in  Hong Kong , reflecting bets
the yuan will strengthen 1.8 percent in a year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts touched 6.4675
yesterday, the weakest level since Feb. 1.  The yuan gained 0.08 percent to 6.5691 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the  China  Foreign Exchange Trade System.
It touched 6.5628 on March 7, the strongest level since China
unified official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  The People’s Bank of China set the currency’s reference
rate 0.03 percent stronger at 6.5668 per dollar. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 0.5 percent on either side of the
official rate.  Wider Band  The government should expand the daily yuan trading band to
1 percent from 0.5 percent from the third quarter, Wang Yong, a
professor at the training school of the People’s Bank of China,
wrote in a commentary in the  Shanghai  Securities News today.  Imports increased 19.4 percent from a year earlier in
February, outpacing a 2.4 percent gain in exports, and the  trade
balance  swung to a deficit of $7.3 billion from a $6.5 billion
surplus the previous month, official figures show.  --Fion Li. Editors: James Regan, Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
