Samsung SDI Co. agreed to plead
guilty and pay a $32 million criminal fine for its role in a
global conspiracy to fix the market for color display tubes used
in computer monitors, the U.S. said.  Samsung, based in Gyeonggi,  South Korea , took part in a
conspiracy from at least January 1997 until at least March 2006
to limit competition by fixing prices, reducing output and
allocating market share of the tubes, the Justice Department
said today in an e-mailed statement.  As part of a plea agreement, Samsung agreed to cooperate
with an investigation of the industry, according to prosecutors.
Samsung was charged today in federal court in San Francisco with
one count of violating U.S. antitrust law, the Justice
Department said. Six individuals also were charged.  A voice mail message left at Samsung SDI America in Irvine,  California , wasnâ€™t immediately returned.  The case is U.S. v. Samsung SDI, 11-162, U.S. District
Court,  San Francisco .  To contact the reporters on this story:
