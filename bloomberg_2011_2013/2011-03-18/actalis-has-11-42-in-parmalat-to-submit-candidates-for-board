Groupe Lactalis, the French dairy
company, said it has a direct holding of 7.28 percent in  Italy ’s  Parmalat SpA (PLT)  and has 4.14 percent under an equity swap contract.  Lactalis can hold up to 7 percent of Parmalat, Italy’s
largest dairy, under the equity swap contract. Lactalis plans to
submit a list of candidates for Parmalat’s board at the
company’s shareholder meeting to be held April 12 and April 14,
the Laval, France-based company also said yesterday in an e-
mailed statement.  A group of shareholders led by Toronto-based Mackenzie
Financial Corp. has proposed an alternative management board for
Collecchio, Italy-based Parmalat. They have nominated Massimo Rossi, a former manager at Swedish Match AB, to lead the
business and he has pledged to boost growth by acquisitions.    Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  Chief Executive Officer Corrado Passera
said on March 16 that Italy’s second-biggest bank would propose
candidates led by Parmalat CEO Enrico Bondi for the board.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
