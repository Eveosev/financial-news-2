Most European stocks advanced as
the Group of Seven nations agreed to sell the yen to ease
concern that  Japan  will sink into recession following the March
11 earthquake. U.S. index futures and Japanese stocks rose.  Oil-services company CGGVeritas gained 2.6 percent and
Swedish energy explorer Lundin Petroleum AB jumped 2.4 percent
as oil surged in New York trading.  Parmalat SpA (PLT)  advanced 3.4
percent after Groupe Lactalis said it has a direct holding of
7.28 percent in the company.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.1 percent to
266.95 at 10:22 a.m. in London, after earlier gaining as much as
0.7 percent. Five stocks rose for every two that fell.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
