Zimbabwe’s Daily News, an
independent newspaper banned by President  Robert Mugabe , was on
sale in the country today for the first time in eight years,
said Managing Editor John Gambanga.  The Harare-based newspaper was printed as a one-off edition
and will be published daily from March 25, Gambanga said in a
statement on the publication’s website.  Daily News was re-issued a license last year by a media
commission created after Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front formed a power-sharing government with the
Movement for Democratic Change in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
