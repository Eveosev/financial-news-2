  KeyCorp (KEY) , Ohio’s second-biggest
bank, raised $625 million selling shares as part of a plan to
repay a U.S. bailout after a  Federal Reserve  review of the
company’s capital strength.  KeyCorp, based in Cleveland, sold 70.6 million shares of
common stock at $8.85 each, the bank said today in a statement.  The Federal Reserve told KeyCorp it didn’t object to a plan
to sell stock and issue debt to help repurchase $2.5 billion of
preferred shares sold to the U.S. Treasury in 2008 as part of
the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the company said in a
statement. KeyCorp paid about $282 million in dividends to
Treasury during the investment period.  KeyCorp advanced 7 cents to $8.92 as of 4 p.m. today in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading before the announcement.  The Federal Reserve didn’t object to a proposal to raise
the quarterly dividend to 3 cents a share from 1 cent starting
in the second quarter, the lender said. KeyCorp’s board is set
to consider the increase in May.    Morgan Stanley (MS)  was capital adviser for the stock offering
and a joint book runner with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
