Cosmo Oil Co., a Japanese refiner
partly owned by  Abu Dhabi , plans to boost processing rates at
its other plants to make up a shortfall after its Chiba facility
was shut by a fire caused by the March 11 earthquake.  Cosmo plans to boost processing runs at its Yokkaichi
facility by 50,000 barrels a day and at the Sakaide refinery by
30,000 barrels, the company said in a statement late yesterday
on its website. It also plans to import an additional 53,000
kiloliters of gasoline and 80,000 kiloliters of jet fuel during
March, the statement said.  Cosmo is canceling diesel exports of 123,000 kiloliters in
March and will direct that fuel toward the domestic market, it
said in the statement. The increase in refining capacity at the
two plants will raise processing to 80 percent of its pre-
earthquake levels, the company said.  The March 11 temblor, the largest ever recorded in  Japan ,
shut 1.3 million barrels a day of refineries totaling about 29
percent of the countryâ€™s capacity. JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp.
shut plants at Sendai, near the epicenter, and Negishi and
Kashima, closer to Tokyo. Kyokuto Petroleum Industries Ltd. and
TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K. are in the process of restarting plants
with about 500,000 barrels a day of capacity.  The 220,000 barrel-a-day Chiba refinery has been shut
because of a fire that started at liquefied petroleum gas tanks
during the earthquake. The fire is still burning, said Cosmo
spokesman Katsuhisa Maeda by telephone today.  Yokkaichi has a capacity of 125,000 barrels a day and
Sakaide can process 110,000 barrels daily, according to
Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
