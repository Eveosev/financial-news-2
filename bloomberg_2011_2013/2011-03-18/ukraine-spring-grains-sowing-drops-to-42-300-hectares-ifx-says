Ukraine had planted 42,300 hectares
(104,481 acres) with early spring grains as of yesterday,
Interfax-Ukraine newswire reported, citing Agriculture Ministry
data.  That was 32 percent less that the 62,000 hectares planted a
year earlier, the Kiev-based newswire reported. Spring-grains
planting started in the Crimean peninsula, and in the Mykolayiv
and Odesa regions, Interfax said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
