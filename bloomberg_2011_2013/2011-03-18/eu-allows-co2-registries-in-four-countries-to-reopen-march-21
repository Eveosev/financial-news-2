The European Union allowed carbon
registries in  Finland ,  Romania , Slovenia and  Sweden  to reopen on
March 21, lifting a suspension imposed after computer-hacking
attacks in January.  The four registries got approval to resume after they
demonstrated that their systems are secure, the European
Commission, the EU regulator, said in a statement today. The
decision means that 19 out of 30 national registries in the
region will be fully operational as of next week, and their
users will have access to all transactions.  The commission shut all registries in the European
emissions-trading system, the world’s largest, on Jan. 19
following a series of computer-hacking attacks involving more
than 2 million permits valued at around 37 million euros ($52
million) at today’s prices. The closure drove spot carbon
markets to a halt for 15 days before the first registries were
allowed to reopen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
