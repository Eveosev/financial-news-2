Belgium, the largest investor in  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA and owner of a 25 percent stake in Fortis Bank
SA/NV, will receive 364.9 million euros ($514 million) in bank
dividends this year that will help stabilize its debt level.  Fortis Bank, based in Brussels, will distribute 96.6
million euros to the Belgian state after resuming a dividend at
80 cents a share, according to a statement today. The lender
reported net income of 1.91 billion euros, compared with a net
loss of 665 million euros in 2009.  The bank rescues that inflated Belgium’s debt burden in
2008 and 2009 are now generating revenue that will assist Prime
Minister Yves Leterme’s caretaker government in narrowing the
2011 deficit to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product and
stabilize the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio at about 97 percent.
Finance Minister  Didier Reynders  forecast Jan. 12 that net
revenue from the financial industry will double this year to 1.5
billion euros, including about 320 million euros in dividends.  “It is true that we put up funds to save the Belgian
banks, but that brings in a lot of money right now,” Reynders
 said  on RTBF radio yesterday. “I prefer BNP Paribas, Fortis,
KBC to pay for the budget rather than the individual taxpayer.”  Income from banks also includes 8.5 percent annual interest
on the government rescue funds  KBC Groep NV (KBC)  received, fees
received for guaranteeing Dexia SA’s borrowings and the premiums
banks and life insurers have to pay for the deposit-guarantee
fund.  Dividend Income    Belgium  will receive 268.3 million euros in dividends from
its 10.7 percent stake in BNP Paribas SA, which it acquired in
May 2009 after handing over a 75 percent stake in Fortis Bank to
the Paris-based lender.  Last year, the Belgian government took a stock dividend
from BNP Paribas and sold a  call option  on those shares to
Societe Generale SA, which later exercised its right to buy the
shares for 45.87 euros apiece. The option transaction boosted
Belgium’s dividend income to 212.9 million euros from the
original 191.6 million euros, Belgium’s  budgetary watchdog  said
Dec. 22 in a report.  Fortis Bank’s profit last year was buoyed by a 970 million-
euro gain from selling businesses to its majority owner BNP
Paribas. The lender recorded the largest gains from the transfer
of operations in  Hong Kong ,  Singapore  and  London  and its former
asset-management business, according to its annual report.  Its balance sheet shrank 19 percent to 348 billion euros
and risk-weighted assets fell by 29 billion euros, boosting
Fortis Bank’s Tier 1 ratio, a measure of its ability to absorb
losses, to 16.5 percent at the end of December.  Profit from continuing operations more than doubled to 1.18
billion euros as loan losses evaporated and Fortis Bank’s cost
of funding decreased. The lender set aside 30 million euros for
bad loans last year, a decrease from 1.86 billion euros in 2009,
and reversed 34 million euros of earlier impairments. Net
interest income climbed 19 percent to 3.66 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
