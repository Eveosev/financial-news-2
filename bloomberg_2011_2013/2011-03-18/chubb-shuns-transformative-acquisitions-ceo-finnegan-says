  Chubb Corp. (CB) , the insurer of
corporate boards and high-end homes, will shun “transformative
acquisitions” and focus on areas where it has built expertise,
Chief Executive Officer John Finnegan said.  The insurer won’t buy companies with the goal of entering
“entirely new types of businesses or becoming a diversified
financial services provider,” Finnegan said in a  letter  to
shareholders posted today on the website of Warren, New Jersey-
based Chubb. “That is not what we are good at.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
