  Scientex Bhd. (SCI) , a Malaysian
chemicals company, said it will team up with Mitsui Chemicals
Tohcello Inc. to manufacture protective cell sheets used in
solar panels.  The partners will each have a 50 percent stake in a joint
venture which will construct a manufacturing plant in Malaysia’s
southern Malacca state with a capacity to produce 10,000 tons of
solar cell sheets a year, Scientex Managing Director Lim Peng
Jin told reporters in Kuala Lumpur today.  Mitsui Chemicals Tohcello, a unit of Japan’s  Mitsui
Chemicals Inc. (4183) , has a 20 percent share in the global market of
encapsulant solar cell sheets with a current volume of 150,000
tons a year, Yasuhiro Kamio, executive officer with Mitsui
Chemicals told reporters. These sheets prevent water and dirt
from infiltrating into solar modules.  “We believe this joint venture will have positive
contribution to our earnings beginning financial year 2013
end,” Lim said. Production is expected to begin in mid-2012, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
