The  Bank of Canada  said it
participated in a coordinated intervention by Group of Seven
nations to weaken the yen.  “Bank of Canada joins concerted intervention by selling
Japanese Yen,” the Ottawa-based central bank said in a
statement posted on its website. It did not elaborate.  The bank did not disclose the size of the intervention. The
finance department will publish further details in its next
report on international reserves, scheduled to be released on
April 5, 2011, bank spokesman Jeremy Harrison said.  Canada held $252 million worth of yen, or 0.4 percent of
the country’s total international reserves, the finance
department said March 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
