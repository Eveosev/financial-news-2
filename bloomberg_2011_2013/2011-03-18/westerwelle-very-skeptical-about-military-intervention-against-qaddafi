Germany abstained from a United
Nations Security Council resolution on Libya because Chancellor
Angela Merkel’s government is “very skeptical” about the
option of military intervention it contains, Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said in a statement.  “We see significant dangers and risks,” Westerwelle said
in the statement, published on the Foreign Ministry’s Internet
site. “Therefore we weren’t able to agree to that part of the
resolution.”  Germany welcomes and supports the tightening of sanctions
against the government of Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ,
Westerwelle said. Qaddafi must end the violence against the
Libyan people immediately, resign and be brought to trial,
Westerwelle said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
