ABco Electronics Co. rose the most
in a month in Seoul trading after the South Korean maker of
mobile-phone components said a shortage in  Japan  led to
increased orders from Samsung Electronics Co.  The shares jumped 5.5 percent to 7,270 won at the 3 p.m.
close of trading in Seoul, the biggest gain since Feb. 14.
Samsung increased its monthly order for signal inductors, used
to select frequencies in phones, to about 11 million units from
5 million, Lee Kun, head of Seongnam, South Korea-based ABcoâ€™s
investor relations team, said by telephone today, confirming an
Edaily report. Jason Kim, a Seoul-based Samsung spokesman,
declined to comment on its suppliers.  The earthquake that rocked Japan and knocked out factories
last week will undermine the global economic recovery this year,
Samsung Chief Executive Officer Choi Gee Sung said today.
Japanese companies may take as long as three months to restart
their factories, according to research firm IHS ISuppli.  TDK Corp. and Murata Manufacturing Co. are among the
biggest Japanese makers of the component, Lee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
