  1Time Holdings Ltd. (1TM) , the low-cost
airline operator, will start flights out from Johannesburg’s
Lanseria airport in the third quarter of the year.  “We have agreed in principle with Lanseria’s management to
start in the third quarter, right now we are still discussing
pricing and congestion at the airport,” said 1Time Holdings
Chief Executive Officer Glenn Orsmond in an interview yesterday
by phone from Johannesburg. “We’ll start with flights to Durban
and  Cape Town .”  The privately owned Lanseria serves as an alternative to
Johannesburg’s O.R. Tambo International Airport,  Africa ’s
busiest. 1Time is targeting 20 percent savings from operating
flights out of Lanseria versus O.R. Tambo, Orsmond said.  After adding Maputo in neighboring Mozambique three months
ago, 1Time has set its sights on both Harare in  Zimbabwe  and
Zambia’s capital, Lusaka, as destinations, Orsmond said. 1Time
has been flying to Zanzibar island in Tanzania and the Zambian
town of Livingstone, which lies near the Victoria Falls tourist
attraction, for the past three years.  “In Harare there are landing slots available and we’re
applying for the licence,” Orsmond said, adding that it is
1Time’s policy to apply wherever operating licenses become
available.  1Time increased passengers by 6.7 percent to 1.9 million in
the year ended in December, the company said in an earnings
statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
