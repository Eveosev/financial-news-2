  Indonesia ’s rupiah rose, trading
near the strongest level in almost four years, on speculation
the central bank will allow the currency to gain to tackle
inflation.  The rupiah advanced for the week after  offshore funds 
increased holdings of Indonesia’s government debt by 2.6 percent
to 205.7 trillion rupiah ($23.4 billion) this month through
March 16, according to official data. Consumer prices in
Southeast Asia’s largest economy increased 6.84 percent in
February from a year earlier, compared with a 7.02 percent rise
in January, the most since April 2009.  “The central bank has said it will allow currency
appreciation to help combat imported inflation,” said Wellian
Wiranto, an economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in  Singapore . “The
market is relatively less concerned about inflation now.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.3 percent this week to 8,773 per
dollar as of 4:22 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It reached 8,745 on March 15, the strongest level
since May 2007. The currency rose 0.1 percent today as the Group
of Seven nations agreed on a joint intervention to restrain the
yen, which reached a post-World War II high yesterday, following
Japan’s devastating earthquake and tsunami.  A strengthening rupiah means the  budget deficit  won’t
increase to more than 2 percent of gross domestic product this
year, Finance Minister  Agus Martowardojo  told reporters
yesterday.  Ten-year  government bonds  advanced for a fifth week. The
yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 fell 12 basis
points this week to 8.33 percent, according to closing prices
from the Inter-Dealer Market Association. The rate dropped three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, from yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
