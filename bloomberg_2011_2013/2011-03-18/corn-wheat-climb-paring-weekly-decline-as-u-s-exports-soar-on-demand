Wheat headed for the biggest two-
day gain in 10 months in  Chicago  and corn advanced as import
demand for U.S. grains surged, spurred by the plunge in prices
after last week’s earthquake in Japan.  Wheat for May delivery climbed as much as 4.8 percent to
$7.44 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, adding to
yesterday’s 7.3 percent jump, and was at $7.42 at 1:17 p.m.
Paris time. Prices are up 12 percent in the past two days, the
biggest jump for the most-active contract since May last year.
The grain is set for a 3.2 percent advance this week.  “Excess remains the best word to describe the price
evolution,” Paris-based farm adviser Agritel said in a
commentary today. “After the downward panic from the past days,
prices are rebounding just as violently.”  Wheat sales by U.S. exporters  gained  15 percent from a week
earlier to 663,700 metric tons in the week to March 10, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said in a report yesterday. The grain
is for delivery in the year through May 31.  Wheat’s advance since yesterday erased the 8.2 percent drop
in the two days through March 16, when concern about the effect
of the earthquake and radiation leaks from Japan’s nuclear
reactors sparked a sell-off in commodities. It is set for a 1.7
percent gain this week.  Milling Wheat  Milling wheat for May delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris rose as much as 6.1 percent to 237.50 euros ($335.75) a
ton and was last at 233.25 euros.  “The losing run seems to pause for now,” said Park Jong
Beom, a trader at Tong Yang Futures Trading Co. in Seoul.
“Except for the concern over  Japan , the situation in the grain
market is supportive from a fundamental perspective.”  In the U.S., excessive snow in the northern Great Plains
and Midwest may spur floods that rival the record-setting deluge
of 2009, threatening wheat crops and livestock as cities in the
region stockpile sandbags.    North Dakota , the largest spring-wheat growing state,  South
Dakota  and  Minnesota  got almost 3 feet since October, more snow
than usual, National Weather Service data show. More than 20
inches remain in some areas, about the same amount that was on
the ground at this time in 2009, before floods along the Red
River of the North caused about $223.7 million in damage and
killed more than 91,000 cattle.  Corn Advances  Corn for May delivery rose as much as 5.2 percent to $6.80
a bushel, adding to yesterday’s 4.9 percent jump. The contract
traded recently at $6.7925, erasing the 7.4 percent loss in the
two days through March 16 and set for a 2.3 percent gain this
week.  U.S. exporters reported corn sales more than doubled to
1.04 million tons in the week ended March 10 from a week
earlier, the USDA said. Exporters also reported the sale of
116,000 tons to unknown destinations for delivery before Sept.
1. The U.S. is the leading grower and exporter of the grain.  “Export sales suggest demand is improving,”  Mark Schultz ,
the chief analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis , said yesterday.    China , the second-biggest producer, became a net importer
last year for the first time since 1996 after adverse weather
reduced crops.  “The export numbers were significantly better than
expectations,” Agritel said. “The rumors of China’s return to
buying ares helping the strong price increase.”  The Major Feedmill Group in  South Korea , the world’s third-
biggest corn importer, yesterday purchased 70,000 tons of U.S.
corn for arrival by July 15 in a tender, according to two
industry executives who took part in the bidding. On March 16,
the Korea Feed Association, the biggest grain buyer in the
nation, bought 110,000 tons of corn in a tender. Tunisia agreed
to buy 25,000 tons in a tender. The price has tumbled 10 percent
this month.  Soybeans for May delivery rose 1 percent to $13.485 a
bushel, for a weekly gain of 1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
