Kenya Power & Lighting Co., the
East African country’s sole electricity distributor, said it
will spend 1.4 billion shillings ($16 million) improving voltage
quality in Nairobi, the capital, and surrounding areas.  “This is good news for manufacturers and commercial
enterprises who have had to endure sagging voltages at times,
thereby compromising quality of power, especially during evening
peak time,” the company said in a  statement  today.  The voltage upgrade project, scheduled to be completed in
June, entails installing capacitors at some of the company’s
sub-stations in Nairobi.  National Contracting Co.  of  Saudi
Arabia  is doing the project, it said.  In January, KPLC, as the company is known, said it raised
9.82 billion shillings in a sale of stock to existing
shareholders where demand exceeded supply by 3.2 percent. The
money raised will help finance government plans to invest $500
million by 2014 to upgrade and expand its electricity grid to
reduce power cuts,  Patrick Nyoike , permanent secretary in the
energy ministry, said Nov. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
