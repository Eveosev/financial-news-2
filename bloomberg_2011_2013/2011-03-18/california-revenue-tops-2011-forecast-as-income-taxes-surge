  California ’s revenue has exceeded
projections by more than $1 billion for fiscal 2011 through
February as income-tax collections gained, Governor  Jerry Brown ’s budget office said.  Since July 1, personal income-tax revenue has beaten
projections by $1.3 billion, or 4.3 percent, through last month,
according to Finance Department figures released today. Overall
collections have exceeded forecasts by $1.024 billion.  “It’s certainly better than the alternative,” said budget
spokesman H.D. Palmer. “You can’t build a trend off of one
month’s data and there are a lot things that can cause these
numbers to move quite a bit on a month-to-month basis.”  California’s revenue gains may be fleeting as tax refunds
in February, the first of several such months, were $449 million
more than projected. Sales and use levies have produced $17.9
billion in receipts this fiscal year though February, in line
with forecasts. Brown is grappling with a $26.6 billion deficit
through July 2012 and has proposed a mix of spending cuts and
tax extensions.  February revenue trailed forecasts by $643 million, partly
because officials last month had to correct an earlier mistake
that shouldn’t have counted $308 million of gasoline sales-tax
revenue from August through January in the general fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
