The nuclear crisis in  Japan  and a
halt of seven reactors in  Germany  may trigger “short-term
fluctuations” in the price of uranium in  Kazakhstan , according
to the deputy minister for economic development and trade.  “We understand that the situation in Japan and what is
happening in other countries, for example, in Germany, can
affect in the short term the price of Kazakh uranium,” Kuandyk
Bishimbayev said at a briefing in Brussels today.  Kazakhstan is the world’s biggest uranium producer,
accounting for almost 28 percent of global output in 2009,
according to World Nuclear Association data. The country has 15
percent of the world’s uranium resources, the association said
on its website.  Japan is struggling to avert a nuclear meltdown after last
week’s earthquake and a tsunami crippled reactors at the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi reactor. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
decided March 15 to keep seven of the country’s oldest reactors
off line during a three-month safety evaluation.  Uranium prices have dropped to $50.01 a pound from $68.24
on March 11, according to data from energy broker MF Global U.K.
Ltd. The price represents the midpoint for bids and offers in
Western markets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
