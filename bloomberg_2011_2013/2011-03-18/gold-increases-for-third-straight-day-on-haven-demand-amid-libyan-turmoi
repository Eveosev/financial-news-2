Gold climbed for the third straight
day on investor demand for an alternative to gyrating
currencies.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  has been pouring cash into the financial
system to stabilize money markets following last week’s
earthquake. The yen fell the most in more than two years against
the dollar as the Group of Seven nations agreed to intervene
jointly in the foreign-exchange market. The dollar headed for a
weekly decline against a basket of six major currencies.  “People look at the moves in the currencies, and they want
to buy gold as a safe haven,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at
FuturePath Trading LLC in  Chicago . “Gold is an international
currency and a stable currency at the moment.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose $11.90, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $1,416.10 an ounce at 1:56 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . The price, down 0.4 percent this week, has
gained 26 percent in the past 12 months. The metal reached a
record $1,445.70 on March 7.  Silver futures for May delivery gained 80 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $35.058 an ounce. The price, down 2.4 percent this
week, has doubled in the past year.  Palladium futures for June delivery climbed $14.40, or 2
percent, to $731.20 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The metal, down 4.5 percent this week, has advanced 53
percent in the past 12 months.  Platinum futures for April delivery advanced $16.50, or 1
percent, to $1,723.40 an ounce. The metal, down 3.3 percent this
week, has climbed 5.7 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
