An investor in  Metro AG (MEO) ’s Media-
Saturn unit, Erich Kellerhals, is suing Metro, saying it failed
to respect contracts,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported,
citing Kellerhals.  Kellerhals, who owns 21.6 percent of Media-Saturn, a
retailer of household electronics, and with other co-owners has
a 25 percent blocking stake in the unit, said Metro was trying
to take away that right from the minority owners, the newspaper
said.  A spokesman for Kellerhals’s investment vehicle,
Convergenta Group, confirmed the lawsuit in a telephone
interview. The spokesman declined to be identified.  "We regret deeply Kellerhals’s proceeding," Michael Inacker, a spokesman for Dusseldorf-based Metro, said by phone.
"Metro is very interested in continuing talks with Kellerhals
about the controlling mechanisms at Media-Saturn. Compromise
proposals are on the table."  To contact the reporter on this story:
