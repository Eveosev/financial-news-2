U.K. sports agent Sky Andrew, who’s
suing  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s News of the World newspaper over phone
hacking claims, won a bid to force police to hand over evidence
obtained in a related criminal probe.  Sharing the evidence won’t hinder the investigation or
“tip off” hacking participants, because the wrongdoers already
know who they are, Justice Geoffrey Vos ruled today at the  High
Court  in  London . The  Metropolitan Police  gave “relatively
flimsy” grounds for withholding the information, including
phone-call records and redacted pages from notebooks, Vos ruled.  “The documents the claimant seeks go to the heart of the
case,” Vos said. “The case cannot be delayed indefinitely
while the police conduct their investigation.”  Andrew is one of more than a half dozen celebrities filing
lawsuits over allegations private voice-mail messages were
accessed for News of the World stories. The paper’s former royal
editor  Clive Goodman  and Mulcaire were jailed in 2007 for
accessing the phone messages of members of the royal family.  A News of the World spokeswoman declined to comment after
the hearing.  The evidence will be disclosed with “appropriate
safeguards” ordered by the judge, including the redaction of
names of potential hacking victims, said Andrew’s lawyer,
Charlotte Harris, after the hearing.  “We are hopeful that the truth will come out and justice
will be done,” said Harris, of the firm Mishcon de Reya.  The case is: Skylet Andrew v. News Group Newspapers
Limited, HC10C01363, High Court of London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
