  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  has made about $3.7 billion, including paper profits, from
its $5 billion investment in  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  at the
depths of the financial crisis in 2008.  Goldman Sachs today said it will pay $5.65 billion to
redeem preferred stock it sold to Berkshire. The price includes
the original investment, plus a 10 percent premium and first-
quarter dividend. Berkshire still holds warrants to buy $5
billion of the New York-based bank’s common stock with a strike
price of $115 per share, which have generated a paper profit of
more than $1.9 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Buffett invested in Goldman Sachs following the collapse of
rival securities firm Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Under terms
of the deal, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire collected a $500
million annual dividend on the preferred stake. Goldman Sachs
closed at $159.96 today on the  New York  Stock Exchange, compared
with $84.39 at the end of 2008.  Goldman Sachs’s redemptions are “unwelcome,” Buffett said
Feb. 26 in his annual letter to shareholders. “After they occur,
our earning power will be significantly reduced.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
