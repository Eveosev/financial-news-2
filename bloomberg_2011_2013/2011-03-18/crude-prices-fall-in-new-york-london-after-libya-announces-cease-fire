Oil dropped from its highest in a
week in  New York  as Libya, holder of Africa’s largest crude
reserves, said it is ceasing all military action and will start
talks with opposition forces.  Oil for April delivery fell as much as $1.04, or 1 percent,
to $100.38 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and
traded at $100.95 as of 1:01 p.m.  London  time. It had earlier
climbed $2.24 to $103.66 a barrel, the highest since March 10.
Brent crude for May settlement fell 1.6 percent to $113.07 a
barrel, having earlier advanced to $117.29.  “The oil market has come off with the announcement, but
this does not mean we’re near a resolution of the situation in
Libya,” said  Harry Tchilinguirian , head of commodity-markets
strategy at BNP Paribas SA in London. “We may be facing an
entrenched status quo between pro and anti-Qaddafi groups.”  Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa announced the
decision today in a televised news conference broadcast by Al
Arabiya TV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
