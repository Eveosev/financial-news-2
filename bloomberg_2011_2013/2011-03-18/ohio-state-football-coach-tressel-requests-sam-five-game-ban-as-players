Ohio State University football
coach Jim Tressel said he deserves the same five-game suspension
handed to his players who violated National Collegiate Athletic
Association rules.  The university’s appeal of the players’ suspensions for the
first five games of the 2011 season was denied by the NCAA’s
reinstatement committee yesterday.  Tressel, who had been suspended for two games by the
university, said he should have the same punishment as the
players, who were disciplined for selling awards, gifts and
university apparel and accepting discounts.  “Throughout this entire situation my players and I have
committed ourselves to facing our mistakes and growing from
them; we can only successfully do that together,” Tressel said
in a  statement  on the Columbus, Ohio-based school’s website. “I
request of the university that my sanctions now include five
games, so that the players and I can handle this adversity
together.”  Tressel was suspended and fined $250,000 by the school for
failing to disclose that the players had violated NCAA rules.  Buckeyes Director of Athletics Gene Smith said he had
accepted Tressel’s request and would notify the NCAA of the
decision to increase the suspension.  In addition to their five-game bans, players Mike Adams,
Daniel Herron, DeVier Posey, Terrelle Pryor and Solomon Thomas
were also ordered to repay $1,000 to $2,500.  To contact the reporter on this story:
