Pharming Group NVâ€™s Rhucin drug
could be introduced on the U.S. market in 2013,  Dow Jones
Newswires  reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive
Officer Sijmen de Vries.  The ruling by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last
month to refuse to review the marketing application for the
Rhucin treatment was a setback, Dow Jones said, citing De Vries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
