The yen’s weakness may be short-
lived as  Japan  would need as much as $500 billion to intervene
in markets just to match its previous efforts to curb the
currency’s strength, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  An intervention of that magnitude will add about 10 percent
of gross domestic product to Japan’s record debt level, wrote
Deutsche Bank analysts including Bilal Hafeez, its head of
currency strategy, in an e-mailed note. The bank based its
estimate on previous moves by the Bank of Japan and the size of
the  currency market .  It would be “a path which the government may be reluctant
to follow given the strain to public finances and the likely
requirement for additional borrowing to fund the earthquake
rebuilding effort,” the bank wrote.  The yen weakened 3.4 percent against the dollar and 4
percent against the euro as of 11:40 a.m. in  London  after the
Group of Seven nations said they will jointly intervene in
foreign-exchange markets for the first time in more than a
decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
