Picasso’s first word, the story
goes, was “piz,” Spanish baby talk for “lapiz” or
“pencil.” He never lost his creative focus on the task at
hand, producing powerful, highly erotic work, including naked
portraits of himself with a model in his studio, right before he
died at 91.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  The 20th century’s most influential and fertile artist,
Picasso changed all he touched as painter, sculptor, printmaker,
ceramicist, designer, draftsman, moving forward even into his
10th decade.  While the artists who died young are romanticized -- think
Keats, Mozart, Schiele -- there are many who continued to work
and develop into old age without becoming repetitive, blithering
fools.  I spoke with Nicholas Delbanco, author of “ Lastingness :
The Art of Old Age,” on the following topics:  1. Long Life, Creative Mind  2. “My Work Is My Life”  3. A Late Style?  4. Freedom to Adventure  5. Youth Culture  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .    Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
