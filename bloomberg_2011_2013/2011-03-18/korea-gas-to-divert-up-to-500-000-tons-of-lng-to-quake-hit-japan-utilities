  Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the world’s
biggest buyer of liquefied natural gas, will divert 400,000 to
500,000 metric tons of the fuel to earthquake-hit  Japan  after a
request by Japanese utilities.  The state-run South Korean utility will provide the LNG
starting from the end of March, the nation’s energy ministry
said in an e-mailed statement today. The swap means the
utilities borrow the gas and return it later, the statement
said.  Japan is seeking alternatives to nuclear power after a
March 11 earthquake forced the shutdown of 11 reactors. The
nation may need LNG, on term contract and for immediate
delivery, totaling as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day, or
about 7.7 million metric tons a year, to burn in generators,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a March 14 report.    South Korea  is also making arrangements to send 52.6 tons
of boric acid to Japan, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
