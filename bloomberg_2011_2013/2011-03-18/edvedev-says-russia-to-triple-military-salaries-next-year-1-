President  Dmitry Medvedev  said
Russia will triple the military’s salary budget next year as the
country overhauls its armed forces.  An officer’s starting salary will be set at 50,000 rubles
($1,756), Medvedev said in Moscow at a military conference
broadcast by state television.  Russia, whose military has struggled with a lack of
financing and development since communism collapsed almost 20
years ago, is seeking to overhaul its armed forces after waging
a five-day war with  Georgia ’s U.S.-trained army in August 2008.  Medvedev has cut the number of military personnel to 1
million and pledged to earmark about 20 trillion rubles ($702
billion) on arms procurement.  The program to upgrade weapons aims to increase the
proportion of “state-of-the-art” equipment to 70 percent of  Russia ’s arsenal, Medvedev said. Their share now stands at 15
percent, Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
