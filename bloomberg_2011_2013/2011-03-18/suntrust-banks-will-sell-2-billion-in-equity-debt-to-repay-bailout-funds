  SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI)  said it will
sell $1 billion in common stock and $1 billion in debt as it
seeks to repay $4.85 billion in U.S. bailout funds.  The  Federal Reserve , which reviewed the financial strength
of the largest U.S. lenders, didn’t object to SunTrust’s
proposed capital plan, the Atlanta-based bank said today in a
statement. Repayment to the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which
will also draw on “other available funds,” is subject to
approval by the U.S. Treasury Department, the firm said.  The company has commenced the stock offering, which is
being managed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.  “We are pleased to have the process behind us, and believe
the outcome of the review strongly validates our deliberate
approach to TARP repayment,” Chief Executive Officer James Wells said in the statement. “SunTrust also looks forward to
returning capital to its shareholders at the appropriate time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
