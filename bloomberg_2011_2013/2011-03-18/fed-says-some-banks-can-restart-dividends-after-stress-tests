The  Federal Reserve  cleared some of
the 19 largest U.S. banks to increase dividends, buy back shares
or repay  government aid  after “significant improvement” in
their capital and the economy.  The banks, including firms such as  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , have increased common equity by more
than $300 billion from the final quarter of 2008 through the end
of 2010, the Fed said in a paper released today in Washington on
its most recent review of bank capital.  “Overall, both the quantity and quality of capital at many
large bank holding companies have improved since the financial
crisis,” the Fed said. “The return of capital to shareholders
under appropriate conditions is a step in the process of
improvement in the financial sector and will help to promote
banks’ long-term access to capital.”  JPMorgan,  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  Minneapolis , Minnesota-
based U.S. Bancorp all announced plans to increase dividends
today.  The KBW Bank Index of 24 companies advanced 1.9 percent at
12:45 p.m. in  New York . Wells Fargo climbed 2 percent to $32.
New York-based JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets,
jumped 2.9 percent to $45.87.  “This is the strongest signal yet that the economy is
starting to return to normal,” said Jaret Seiberg, a financial
policy analyst for MF Global’s Washington Research Group.
“Banks are going to be significantly raising their dividends
and engaging in share buybacks in a way that recognizes their
return from much more dire financial straits.”  Higher Standards  The Fed’s stress tests are part of a move toward higher
standards for capital and risk management mandated by U.S.
legislators and international regulatory accords. The Fed wants
to ensure bank boards make capital-payout decisions while
weighing a full range of risks and their capital needs for at
least two years.  San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, the nation’s largest home
lender, authorized the repurchase of 200 million shares and a
special dividend of 7 cents a share, which will raise the first-
quarter payout to 12 cents. JPMorgan said it will boost its
quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 5 cents and
authorized a $15-billion stock repurchase.  Dividend Limit  “In 2011, firms generally are expected to limit dividends
to 30 percent or less of anticipated earnings,” the  Fed  said.
At the end of April, the Fed will deliver “detailed
assessments” of the plans “including feedback on areas where
the plans and processes need to be strengthened.”  The central bank also said that approval of plans would
only apply to 2011. Capital distributions in 2012 will be
subjected to a future supervisory review.  “In reality, bank holding companies would be expected to
reduce distributions under adverse conditions,” the Fed said.  The dividend increases were one of the most carefully
screened payouts in U.S. regulatory history, with more than 100
Fed staff working on the analysis. The central bank’s
involvement in decisions normally reserved for boards shows how
far the Dodd-Frank Act has pushed regulators into corporate
governance.  Central bank supervisors asked the banks to test the
performance of their loans, securities, and earnings against at
least three economic scenarios. Banks devised baseline and
adverse scenarios, and Fed supervisors provided a separate
adverse scenario involving another recession with unemployment
exceeding 11 percent.  Quality, Quantity  “Overall, both the quantity and quality of capital at many
large bank holding companies have improved since the financial
crisis,” the Fed release said. The 19 companies’ Tier 1 common
ratio rose to 9.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 from 5.4
percent two years earlier, the Fed said.  The central bank is taking “a measured and conservative
approach in considering such capital distributions,” because of
“continued uncertainty around the pace and strength of the
economic recovery in the  United States  and abroad, and the
extraordinary nature of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.”  Unlike the stress tests of May 2009, the Fed did not
publish the capital buffer needs of specific banks. In this
case, the Fed is allowing boards to make the announcements. Fed
officials want long-range capital planning to be a regular
regimen at the banks.  No Disclosure  “The Federal Reserve does not intend to disclose any firm-
specific results,” from the test, the report said.  The tests are being overseen by a new financial-risk unit
assembled by Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and Fed Governor
Daniel Tarullo. Known as the Large Institution Supervision
Coordinating Committee, or LISCC, the unit draws on the Fed’s
ranks of economists, quantitative researchers, regulatory
experts and forecasters and looks at risks across the financial
system. The LISCC last year helped Bernanke respond to an
emerging liquidity crisis faced by European banks.  Regulators in this review made one of the largest data
requests in Fed history, outside of normal regulatory reporting,
asking banks for information about their securities, loans and
other holdings. This gave the Fed the ability to check and even
challenge the assumptions banks make about their portfolios.  The Fed said its adverse economic scenario included a 1.5
percent decline in gross domestic product from the fourth
quarter of last year through the end of 2011. The scenario
assumed growth resumes, with output rising 3.4 percent in 2013.
Unemployment would peak at 11.1 percent in the first quarter of
2012 and drop back to 9.6 percent by the end of 2013.  Home Prices  Home prices would fall 6.2 percent in 2011 and 4.1 percent
in 2012. The scenario also included a 27.8 percent drop in
equity prices where The Dow Jones Total Stock Market Index would
fall to 8,716 in the fourth quarter of 2011.  “The six largest firms were required to estimate potential
losses stemming from trading activities and private equity
investments using the same severe global market shock scenario”
that was applied in the May 2009 stress tests, the Fed said.  Banks were asked to study capital performance over at least
nine quarters through the end of 2012.  A “key benchmark” was whether a bank’s adjusted Tier 1
common ratio “exceeded a supervisory reference level of 5
percent on a pro forma, post-stress basis” in each quarter, the
Fed said. The Tier 1 common ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 common
capital - defined as common equity minus Tier 1 deductions - to
risk-weighted assets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
