  Petroleos Mexicanos , Latin
America’s largest oil producer, said its proved reserves of
crude dropped for a 12th straight year as the company faced
delays bringing new projects online.  Reserves fell “slightly” in 2010,  Carlos Morales , head of
production and exploration, said today in an interview in Ciudad
del Carmen,  Mexico . He didn’t disclose the size of Pemex’s
reserves. Pemex had 13.992 billion barrels of proved oil
reserves in 2009.  The company replaced 81 percent of proved reserves through
discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico, up from 77 percent, he said.
Mexico has set a goal of 100 percent replacement by 2012, the
end of President Felipe Calderon’s term.  Pemex will pump more than 2.6 million barrels a day this
year, Chief Executive Officer  Juan Jose Suarez Coppel  said today
at an event in Ciudad del Carmen. The company previously
forecast output of 2.55 million barrels a day.  Last year, Mexico’s National Hydrocarbons Commission as
well as independent auditors disagreed with Pemex regarding the
amount of so-called possible and probable oil-equivalent
reserves at the Chicontepec development, where the company
estimates it has 18.5 billion barrels of both types of reserves,
according to a March 1 company presentation.  Missing ‘Pieces’  “They haven’t put the pieces of the puzzle together” to
incorporate more reserves from Chicontepec, Jeremy Martin, an
oil specialist at the Institute of the Americas in  La Jolla ,  California , said yesterday in a telephone interview.  Chicontepec is a field with small pockets of oil and low
pressure spread across the states of Puebla, Hidalgo and
Veracruz near the  Gulf of Mexico  in central and eastern Mexico.  Proved reserves are those that have a reasonable certainty
of being recoverable under existing economic and political
conditions with current technology. Probable and possible
reserves are unproved reserves that indicate the relative degree
of uncertainty about their existence, according to the  Society
of Petroleum Engineers  and World Petroleum Council.  In 2007, Pemex forecast output of 660,000 barrels a day by
2015 for Chicontepec. Last year, Pemex cut that forecast to
150,000 barrels. Chicontepec was producing 47,000 barrels a day
as of last week, according to a preliminary Pemex report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
