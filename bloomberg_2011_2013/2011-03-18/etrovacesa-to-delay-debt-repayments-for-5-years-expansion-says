  Metrovacesa SA (MVC) , a property holding
company, reached agreement with 90 percent of its lenders to
delay debt repayments for five years,  Expansion  reported, citing
unidentified people at Metrovacesa.  Metrovacesa will pay the interest on its 5.76 billion euros
($8.1 billion) worth of loans but not the principle, the
newspaper said.  The company will also present a scheme of arrangement, a
court-approved plan between a company and its lenders, in the
U.K. to allow it to reach an accord with its lenders to
restructure debt, the newspaper said.  Metrovacesa is presenting the scheme of arrangement under
U.K. law because it states that companies have to reach an
agreement with at least 75 percent of creditors, whereas in
Spain creditor agreement must be 100 percent, the newspaper
said.  The company will also stage a 1.2 billion euros capital
increase, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
