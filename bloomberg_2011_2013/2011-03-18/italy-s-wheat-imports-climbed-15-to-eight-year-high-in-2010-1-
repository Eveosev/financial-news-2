Imports of wheat into  Italy , the
world’s third-largest buyer of the grain, rose to an eight-year
high in 2010 as domestic production fell, data from the national
cereal-industry association showed.  Overall inbound wheat shipments gained 15 percent to 7.39
million metric tons from 6.45 million tons a year earlier, the
Rome-based Associazione Nazionale Cerealisti, known as Anacer,
said in an e-mailed statement today. That was the largest amount
shipped in since 2002.  Italians include more wheat products such as bread and
pasta in their diet than the French, Germans, Americans or
British, according to  data  from the International Maize and
Wheat Improvement Center. Italy imported more than 6 million
tons of wheat in nine of the past 10 years, Anacer figures show.    France  confirmed itself as the main supplier country for
cereal grains, with about 26 percent of the cereals exported to
Italy, followed by Hungary and  Canada ,” Anacer said.  Total grain imports rose to 12.25 million tons from 11
million tons, Anacer said. Only Egypt and  Brazil  imported more
wheat than Italy in the year through June 2010, according to
data from the International Grains Council.  Trade Deficit  Italy’s grain imports were valued at 4.11 billion euros
($5.8 billion) in 2010, while cereal-industry exports amounted
to 2.58 billion euros, for a trade deficit of 1.53 billion
euros, Anacer said. That compared with a 1.27 billion-euro
shortfall a year earlier.  Imports of soft wheat, used to make bread and for  animal
feed , jumped 12 percent to 4.81 million tons. Deliveries of the
harder durum variety, used to make pasta, advanced 20 percent to
2.58 million tons.  Inbound shipments of barley surged 31 percent to 846,688
tons, while Italy’s corn imports were little changed at 2.07
million tons.  Overall Italian wheat production fell to 6.92 million tons
last year from 7.01 million tons, according to industry group
 Associazione Granaria Emiliana Romagnola , which cited government
statistics.  Exports by Italy’s cereal industry, including risotto rice
and processed products such as pasta, climbed 13 percent to 4.09
million tons, the Anacer figures showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
