KazMunaiGaz National Co.,  Kazakhstan ’s state-owned energy producer, is in talks to buy
Helios, the largest chain of filling stations in the nation.  “We are in talks with Helios owners to buy the whole
chain,” said Timur Kulibayev, deputy head of the state-owned
National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna, which owns the oil
producer. Kulibayev, who was speaking to reporters today in
Almaty, declined to disclose the price.  Closely held Helios owns 228 filling stations in 50 Kazakh
communities and sells fuel produced by the KazMunaiGaz-
controlled Pavlodar refinery, according to the chain’s  website .
KazMunaiGaz is seeking a Russian oil producer to buy into the
refinery, which processes crude from Kazakhstan’s northern
neighbor.  Kazakhstan has an agreement with  Russia  that allows oil to
be shipped to the  Pavlodar refinery  without export duty until
2014, Kulibayev said. While KazMunaiGaz could send crude from
the west of the country to the refinery in the north, it would
be more profitable to “cooperate with Russian producers,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
