B2W Cia. Global de Varejo tumbled
the most in the benchmark Bovespa stock index, reaching the
lowest price in almost two years, after reporting an unexpected
fourth-quarter loss.    Brazil ’s biggest online retailer fell 6.1 percent to 23.90
reais in Sao Paulo trading, the lowest price since April 7,
2009. B2W is down 24 percent this year, compared with a 3.5
percent drop for the Bovespa.  B2W reported a net loss of 14.2 million reais ($8.5
million) due to higher expenses. The company was forecast to
have 21.8 million reais in profit, according to the average
estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Financial expenses and other operational expenses
continue to sacrifice the bottom line, leading the company to a
loss at the last quarter of the year,” Ativa Corretora analyst
Luciana Leocadio wrote in a report after the earnings were
released. Ativa rates B2W  “neutral” and said it’s reviewing
the Rio de Janeiro-based company’s valuation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
