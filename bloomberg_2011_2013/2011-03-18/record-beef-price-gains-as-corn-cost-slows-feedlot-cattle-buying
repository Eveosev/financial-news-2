U.S. feedlots probably bought fewer
cattle to fatten for slaughter last month as surging corn costs
spurred losses, signaling smaller herds this year and further
gains in beef prices that already are the highest ever.  Feedlot operators purchased about 1.646 million head, down
1.7 percent from February 2010 and the first year-over-year drop
since July, according to a Bloomberg survey of 14 analysts. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will release its estimate today
at 3 p.m. in  Washington .  Rising demand helped send U.S. beef to a  record  $4.288 a
pound on average at supermarkets in February, as corn prices
reached a 31-month high and the pace of food inflation
accelerated, government data show. Wendy’s/Arby’s Group Inc.,
the third-biggest U.S. hamburger chain, said this month that its
beef costs may rise 15 percent or more this year.  “Availability of calves and feeders is a problem, and it
will get even worse,” said  Rich Nelson , the director of
research at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois . “This will
tighten beef supplies in the third and fourth quarter and
through all of 2012. We will see retailers scramble to have the
consumer pay.”  Feedlot operators in the U.S., the world’s largest beef
producer and the largest exporter, after  Brazil , buy year-old
cattle that weigh 500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds,
called feeders. It takes four or five months on a diet of mostly
corn before the animals weigh about 1,200 pounds, when they are
sold to meatpackers.  Higher Costs  Higher input costs are driving beef prices higher, said
Jerry Rebel, the chief financial officer of San Diego-based
fast-food chain Jack in the Box Inc. By year end, retail-beef
prices may be up 15 percent from 2010, Allendale’s Nelson said.  The higher cost of grain means feedlots without risk-
management plans lost about $6 on each animal sold in February,
compared with a $20 profit a year earlier, said  Ron Plain , a
livestock economist at the  University of Missouri  in Columbia.  “Feed costs continued to rise,” Plain said. “Most cattle
feeders were probably surprised by how expensive feed ended up
being during the period.”  Even after the price of corn dropped from last month’s high
of $7.4425 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the grain is
73 percent higher than a year ago, reducing the incentive for
feedlots to expand purchases of young cattle. Yesterday, corn
futures for May delivery rose 30 cents, or 4.9 percent, to
$6.465, the biggest gain in five months.  Costs Curb Output  Feedlots may pay $5.05 to $5.75 a bushel for corn in the
year that began Sept. 1, “up substantially” from the average
of $3.55 a year earlier, Shayle Shagam, a USDA livestock analyst
said on Feb. 25. U.S. beef output may drop 1.5 percent, he said.  While feedlots are buying fewer animals, their herds may
have increased because operators increased purchases in previous
months as beef demand and prices jumped, analysts said. The
total herd on March 1 probably will be 5 percent larger than a
year earlier at 11.386 million head, according to the Bloomberg
survey. Producers probably sold 1.764 million animals to beef
plants in February, up 2.8 percent from a year earlier, analysts
said.  Including dairy cows, the total U.S. cattle herd on Jan. 1
totaled 92.582 million head, the lowest since 1958, government
data showed on Jan. 28. That figure may shrink an additional 1
percent this year as higher feed costs prompt dairy and beef-cow
producers to maintain smaller herds, Shagam said.  Wholesale choice-beef prices jumped 22 percent in the past
year to $1.8779 a pound yesterday, according to USDA data. The
price of slaughter-ready cattle on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange climbed 19 percent over the same period, touching a
record $1.18 a pound on March 9.  Meat Exports Rise  The rallies were fueled partly by global economic growth
that is boosting incomes and demand for meat protein in emerging
economies, including  China .  U.S. beef  exports  jumped 19 percent in 2010 to 2.3 billion
pounds (1.04 million metric tons), according to USDA data.  Mexico  was the biggest buyer last year, followed by Canada and  Japan . U.S. shipments rose 24 percent in January from the same
month in 2010, according to the government.  Cattle futures for June delivery rose 1 percent yesterday
to $1.11775 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Feeder-cattle
futures, which touched a record $1.38 a pound on March 9, closed
yesterday at $1.32175, up 1 percent.  Beef and chicken purchased by Wendy’s/Arby’s restaurants
each account for one-fifth of the total spent on commodities,
Stephen E. Hare, the chief financial officer, said March 10 at
an industry conference in  New York .  Cost Risk  “Beef costs are anticipated to increase 10 percent to 15
percent in 2011, with a risk that they could go even higher,”
Hare said. The Atlanta-based company will make up that cost with
higher selling prices and more favorable chicken costs, he said.  Consumers already are paying more. Retail-beef prices
measured by a composite that includes choice beef, other beef
and hamburger values, rose 9.4 percent in February from a year
earlier, the USDA said in a report yesterday.  U.S. food inflation accelerated 0.9 percent in January, the
fastest monthly pace since June 2008, when prices were headed
for their biggest annual gain in 28 years. Costs will rise as
much as 4 percent this year, more than the 2 percent to 3
percent estimated in January, the USDA said last month. For the
year, shoppers may  pay  as much as 4.5 percent more for beef, the
department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
