they will jointly intervene in foreign-exchange markets for the
first time in more than a decade.  The yen dropped 3.3 percent to 81.55 per dollar as of 11:46
a.m. in  Tokyo , the biggest one-day decline since Oct. 28, 2008.  Japan â€™s currency slid 3.6 percent to 114.75 per euro.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
