  BG Group Plc. (BG/)  predicts that the
Brazilian deepwater oil discoveries known as Lula and Iracema
hold more than 10 billion barrels of oil combined, higher than
the estimates of state-controlled  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the
 Folha de S. Paulo  newspaper reported on its website.  BG is using new information to make its calculations that
was not available when Petrobras estimated recoverable reserves
at the two fields of 8.3 billion barrels, Folha said, citing
Nelson Silva, BGâ€™s head in Brazil.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known,
operates the two fields and BG has minority 25 percent stakes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
