  Chile  lifted restrictions on U.S.
beef from cattle older than 30 months, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said.  All beef and beef by-products with the exception of select
items are eligible for export to Chile, the USDA’s Food Safety
and Inspection Service said in a  statement  on its website dated
March 17. In  2005 , Chile allowed purchases of U.S. beef from
cattle younger than 30 months of age after suspending all
imports of the meat because of the first U.S. case of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy in 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
