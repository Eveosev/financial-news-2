U.S. Senate Energy Committee
Chairman Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat, said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, that while the nuclear
emergency in Japan is “very significant and serious,” it is
no repeat of the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine 25 years
ago.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin the show with Democratic Senator
Jeff Bingaman, who joins us in the studio.  Chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, Senator, you
are fully briefed. Is this Japanese disaster the worst
nuclear disaster in history? And how’s it going to end up?  SENATOR JEFF BINGAMAN: I don’t think it’s the worst in
history. I think Chernobyl’s the worst in history.  HUNT: So it won’t be quite that bad?  BINGAMAN: Right. I don’t believe it will. But there’s
a lot of uncertainty about what’s going to happen. And I
don’t pretend to have the answer to that, but I think it’s
clearly a very significant and serious problem that we hope
both the Japanese and ourselves can learn a great deal
from.  HUNT: You, along with President Obama and others, have
said that nuclear has to be part of the future U.S. energy
strategy or policy. With this tragedy, is the nuclear
renaissance over, though?  BINGAMAN: Well, the nuclear - the so-called nuclear
renaissance has not really occurred in a meaningful way. We
have something in the range of 20 applications before the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  to build new nuclear plants,
but I think there’s only one now that is under
construction. And we have 104 plants that are operating.
And so I think the thing that’s held the nuclear power
industry back in recent years has been the economics. It
just costs so much to build a nuclear power plant compared
-  HUNT: But this isn’t going to make that any easier, is
it?  BINGAMAN: No, there’s no question this raises a whole
new set of questions.  HUNT: Right.  BINGAMAN: And depending upon what is determined
ultimately from this, it could be a significant impediment
to construction of new plants, but perhaps not. We need to
- we need to see in the future.  HUNT: Let me ask you a couple particulars there. The
administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are
reviewing all U.S. facilities. I think it’s one-fifth of
our reactors have the same design as that Japanese - now,
they’re not located, you know, near an earthquake, or most
of them aren’t, but do you think we should consider
temporarily closing a few of those who may be in the most
dangerous spots until we know all the facts?  BINGAMAN: I don’t know of anything that would justify
closing down the facilities that are now operating. I think
the president was wise to order a review - a safety review
of all of our 104 plants. And if something is determined as
a result of that review that would justify shutting them
down, then that’s obviously what we should do.  HUNT: But not now?  BINGAMAN: I don’t - I don’t know of anything that
would justify shutting them down before that review is
done.  HUNT: The Germans, as you know, suspended relicensings
of plants. There are others who’ve said we ought to put a
moratorium on 18 to 20 new applications. Merit in either of
those approaches?  BINGAMAN: Well, as far as putting a moratorium on
applications, you know, the processing of an application
takes years before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. I’m
sure that our Nuclear Regulatory Commission will take into
account whatever is learned from what’s going on in  Japan .  HUNT: You don’t think we should go the German route of
-  BINGAMAN: I can’t see what justification there would
be for stopping the use of nuclear  power plants  that have
been certified and that are operating safely.  HUNT: Does this accident underscore the need for the
U.S. to move forward expeditiously on a permanent
repository planned site, including putting Yucca Mountain
back on the agenda?  BINGAMAN: Well, I’ve always favored going ahead with a
repository, a permanent repository for nuclear waste. I
don’t know that there’s anything about this incident in
Japan, this tragedy in Japan, that changes that
particularly. I mean, we need a long-term storage plan for
nuclear waste, and we’ve needed that for a long time now.  HUNT: Do you think there’s any prospect for that
occurring in the rest of your tenure in the Senate?  BINGAMAN: Well, there is a blue-ribbon commission that
the president’s appointed that has been meeting for about a
year now that is coming out with a report this summer,
making recommendations for what should be done if we’re not
going to use Yucca Mountain. And, of course, the
administration’s position is, we will not use Yucca
Mountain as a repository.  So once those recommendations come from that
commission, I think at that point it would be appropriate
for us to see if they’ve recommended something we ought to
adopt.  HUNT: Going back to Japan, people can’t be assured
without candor and transparency. Now, Bloomberg reported
this week that Tokyo Electric Power Company has a long
history of falsified reports. And our top officials, some
of what they told us, it doesn’t square with what the
Japanese are saying. Is Japan hurting itself with the lack
of transparency here?  BINGAMAN: Well, I do think you’re right, that Tokyo
Electric Power does have some credibility problems on some
of these issues based on prior actions. And I think - I
think myself that we should do all we can to persuade the
Japanese of the views that our experts have come up with
and see if we can stay on the same page with them as far as
our estimation of the risk, as far as our plans for
assisting them to deal with this crisis. All of that I
think is helpful.  HUNT: Senator, as you know, as gasoline prices soar,
Republicans have assailed the Obama administration for what
they say are overzealous environmental regulations and
stifling exploration or drilling. You gave a speech in the
Senate floor this week that says none of that’s true. Do
you think Republicans are playing politics with gasoline
prices?  BINGAMAN: Oh, I don’t think there’s any question.
Whenever the price of gas at the pump goes up, Americans
get to looking around for who’s to blame, and that’s
understandable. And I think that it’s very convenient if
you’re - if you want to find a scapegoat to say the
president’s bound to be to blame. He’s in the White House.  I think the truth is, the price of oil at the pump -
or the price of gasoline at the pump directly tracks the
price of oil on world markets, and there’s nothing that I
know of that the Obama administration has done that has
raised the price of oil on world markets. They’ve been
trying to do what they could to keep the price of oil from
going up, but they haven’t raised it.  HUNT: You’re chairman of the committee. Do you plan to
introduce and push sometime soon this year clean air energy
legislation? And, if so, will it include a nuclear
component?  BINGAMAN: We have been trying to see if we could get a
consensus in our committee to go ahead with something like
the president called for in his State of the Union speech,
which would be a clean energy standard, which would be
trying to - trying to put in a requirement in law that
utilities move to where 80 percent of the electricity
they’re producing be from clean-energy sources, and he
defined that to include nuclear, natural gas, clean coal, a
variety of other -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: And how are the prospects looking?  BINGAMAN: Well, I don’t know. It’s too soon to know.  HUNT: It’s tough?  BINGAMAN: It’s tough. It’s tough. And anything’s tough
in  Washington  these days, but this, of course, will be
tough, too. But we’re working on it, and we hope - we hope
we can make some progress.  HUNT: OK, Chairman Bingaman, thank you so much for
being with us. And when we come back, the U.N. gets tough
with Qaddafi. We’ll talk to our reporters next.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY
