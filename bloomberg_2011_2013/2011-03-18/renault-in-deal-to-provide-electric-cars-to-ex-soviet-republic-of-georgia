  Renault SA (RNO)  signed an agreement to
provide electric cars to  Georgia  starting next year, the former
Soviet republic’s economic development ministry said today.  The French carmaker will initially conduct feasibility
studies and help develop infrastructure, the statement said.  Vera Kobalia, Georgia’s minister for sustainable
development, said in November that the government plans to buy
about 4,000 electric cars from various producers over the next
three or four years, while auctioning off the existing fleet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
