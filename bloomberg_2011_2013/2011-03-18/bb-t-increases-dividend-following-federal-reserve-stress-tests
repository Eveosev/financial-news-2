  BB&T Corp. (BBT) , the ninth-largest U.S.
bank by deposits, said it will increase its dividend to 16 cents
a share from 15 cents after the  Federal Reserve  released results
of its stress tests on the industry.  BB&T, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, also will pay
a 1-cent special dividend per common share in the second
quarter, the lender said in a statement today.  The Fed today said some of the 19 largest U.S. banks will
be able to restart dividend payments, buy back shares or repay
government capital after “significant improvement” in their
capital positions and the economy.  “We continue to be one of the strongest capitalized
institutions in the industry, and we believe this action
confirms that strength,” BB&T Chief Executive Officer Kelly King said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
