(Corrects name of company in headline and first paragraph.)  Aksa Elektrik Toptan Satis AS, a
Turkish trader of electricity, will sign a contract within a
week to sell up to 500 megawatts of electricity a year to
neighboring  Syria , the company’s business development manager
said today.  “All documents have been signed after we agreed on all
terms and conditions of the deal,” Mutlu Sevimli said in an
interview at a conference in Damascus. The sale would involve
about one fourth of Aksa’s 2,000 megawatts of annual production,
he said.  “We are also very much interested in investing in power
production and distribution in Syria,” Sevimli said. “We have
submitted tender documents for power projects in Syria in both
wind and natural gas power generation plants.” Aksa Elektrik is
owned by  Turkey ’s Kazanci Holding AS.  Turkey has exported electricity to Syria since 2006. The
Arab country paid 93.8 million euros ($131.4 million) for
Turkish electricity over the last two years combined, Syrian
Deputy Electricity Minister Hisham Mashfej said at the same
industry conference.  Officials from the two nations signed an agreement today to
expand their cooperation in the power industry.  Syria plans to spend 350 billion Syrian pounds ($7.5
billion) on power projects and will focus on renewable energy,
the official SANA news agency reported in December, citing
Electricity Minister Ahmad Kayali. The envisaged projects
include solar and wind plant, the minister said, according to
SANA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
