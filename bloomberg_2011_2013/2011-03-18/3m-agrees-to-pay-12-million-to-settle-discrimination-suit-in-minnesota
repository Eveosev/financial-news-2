  3M Co. (MMM) , the maker of products
including Scotch tape and  Post-it Notes , agreed to pay as much
as $12 million to settle an age discrimination lawsuit.  Under the agreement, which is subject to approval by the
Ramsey County District Court in St. Paul, Minnesota, 3M will
resolve the claims of about 7,000 members of the class
represented by the lawsuit.  The proposed settlement “provides a reasonable resolution
that allows the company to avoid ongoing investments in time and
legal fees,” Marschall Smith, 3M general counsel, said in a
statement. “We believe the resolution will allow the company
and our employees to focus on growing our business and serving
our customers.”  The plaintiffs, all employed by 3M in  Minnesota , claimed
that the company systematically discriminated against workers
over the age of 46 from 2001 to 2005. Management perceived older
workers as “less able or willing to accept and apply new
business methodologies adopted by the company,” according to
the complaint.  The suit was first filed in 2004. In 2008, state court
Judge Gregg Johnson granted class certification to the
plaintiffs. 3M appealed his decision to the state Court of
Appeals, which reversed it in April 2009. Because settlement
talks were under way, Johnson postponed a second round of
arguments about certification late last year.  The case is Clifford L. Whitaker, et. al. v. 3M Company,
62-C4-04-012239, Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota).  To contact the reporter on this story:
