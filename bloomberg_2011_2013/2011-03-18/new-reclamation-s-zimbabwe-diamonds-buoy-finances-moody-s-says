New Reclamation Group Ltd.’s
diamond-mining venture with the Zimbabwean government has played
a “significant role” in improving the South African scrap-
metal recycler’s finances, Moody’s Corp. said.  The company’s operating performance improved “largely due
to its diamond mining operations,” without which Johannesburg-
based New Reclamation would be in a “significantly less
favorable liquidity position,” Moody’s said in a statement.  The scrap company owns half of Mbada Diamonds, operating in  Zimbabwe ’s Marange region, the country’s biggest diamond field.
Rights groups including Global Witness and  Human Rights Watch 
accuse the nation’s army and police of involvement in smuggling,
rape and assault in Marange. The government denies the claims.  Moody’s confirmed New Reclamation’s Caa2 rating, the sixth-
worst of 23 possible ratings, with a negative outlook. The
company faces “ongoing liquidity concerns” particularly on
refinancing notes maturing 2013, the rating company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
