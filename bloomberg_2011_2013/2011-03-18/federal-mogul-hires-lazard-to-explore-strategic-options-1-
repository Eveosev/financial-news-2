  Federal-Mogul Corp. (FDML) , the auto-parts
supplier controlled by billionaire  Carl Icahn , said it retained
Lazard Freres & Co. to help evaluate strategic alternatives to
enhance shareholders’ value.  There is “no assurance that any alternative will develop
or be pursued,” the Southfield, Michigan-based company said
today in a statement.  Icahn likely is looking to capitalize on his investment in
Federal-Mogul, which makes everything from piston rings for
automakers to windshield wipers for consumers, Brian Sponheimer,
an analyst with Gabelli & Co., said in a telephone interview.  “Given how diverse the product offerings are, I’m not
certain there is a pure fit among strategic buyers within the
industry," said Sponheimer, who recommends buying the shares.
‘‘A financial buyer, such as private equity, would want to take
advantage of what we think is further upside from continued
growth in the automotive space.”  Federal-Mogul rose $2.43, or 10.7 percent, to $25.05 at
2:47 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have gained 9.5 percent this year before today.  Icahn controlled 76 percent of Federal-Mogul’s shares as of
January 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
