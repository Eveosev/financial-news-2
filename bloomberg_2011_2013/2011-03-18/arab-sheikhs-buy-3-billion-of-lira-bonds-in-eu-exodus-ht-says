Arab Sheikhs bought billions of
dollars of Turkish lira bonds as they pulled capital out of  Europe  fearing action against protestors in their countries
might prompt the EU to freeze their assets, Haberturk said.  Turkish banks sold 5 billion liras ($3.2 billion) of bonds
between the start of February and March 4, and 4.7 billion liras
were bought by foreigners, helping yields drop almost 70 basis
points, the Istanbul-based newspaper said. A huge amount of the
bonds were bought by the Sheikhs, it said citing unidentified
analysts.  Arab leaders see  Turkey  as a safe haven and bring money to 
the country via investment funds to keep their identities 
confidential, Haberturk said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
