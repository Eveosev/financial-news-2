  Emis Group Plc (EMIS) , the U.K.’s biggest
health-care records software vendor to National Health Service
doctors, said earnings rose 13 percent as it added more medical
practices, especially in  Scotland .  Net income was 11.2 million pounds ($18.1 million), or
19.84 pence per share, compared with 9.9 million pounds, or
19.88 pence per share a year earlier, the Leeds, England-based
company said in a statement on Regulatory News Service.  Today Emis said it increased the number of doctors’ offices
it serves by 3.7 percent over the year, to 5,576, and it
quadrupled its market share in Scotland. In August, Emis
acquired a majority interest in RX Systems Ltd. to expand into
systems linking pharmacies. Its Healthcare Gateway project is
designed to expand sharing of patient data.  The company “formed a joint venture to deliver wider
interoperability through Healthcare Gateway, progressed existing
and new extended primary care and community projects in
Liverpool,  London , Cumbria and Cheshire and extended our
international reach into Australia,” Chief Executive Officer
Sean Riddell said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
