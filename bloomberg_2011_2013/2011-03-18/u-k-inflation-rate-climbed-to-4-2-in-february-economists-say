U.K. inflation probably accelerated
to the fastest pace since October 2008 in February, which may
sharpen the divide among  Bank of England  policy makers on
whether to raise  interest rates  to tame price pressures.  Consumer prices rose 4.2 percent from a year earlier
compared with a 4 percent increase in January, according to the
median forecast of 32 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The
Office for National Statistics in London will publish the data
at 9:30 a.m. on March 22.  Inflation has held above the central bank’s 2 percent
target for 14 months after commodity prices surged and the
pound’s 25 percent drop on a trade-weighted basis since the
start of 2007 boosted import costs. Bank officials split four
ways at last month’s policy meeting as they gauged the threat
from inflation against the sustainability of the recovery.  “Increases in food and energy prices are creating upward
pressure on inflation and that will persist for the next few
months,” Adam Chester, an economist at Lloyds TSB Bank Plc in
London, said in a telephone interview. “It will come back down
as the economic environment remains weak.”  The Bank of England’s nine-member Monetary Policy
Committee, led by  Mervyn King , held its benchmark interest rate
at a record low of 0.5 percent this month. Minutes of the
meeting to be published a day after the inflation data will show
if any other officials voted with  Andrew Sentance ,  Martin Weale 
and Spencer Dale for a rate increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
