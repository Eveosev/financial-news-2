Longer-term Treasuries dropped as  Libya  said it’s ceasing all military action after the  United
Nations Security Council  authorized a no-fly zone.  “There’s some resolution coming out of Libya,” said Paul
Horrmann, a broker in  New York  at Tradition Asiel Securities
Inc., an interdealer broker. “It looks like the flight to
quality is coming out. Yields snapped to the higher side.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
