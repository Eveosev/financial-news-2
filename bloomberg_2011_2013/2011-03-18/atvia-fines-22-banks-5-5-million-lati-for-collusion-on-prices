Latvia’s Competition Council fined
22 lenders about 5.5 million lati ($11 million) for colluding on
the price for bank-card transactions and the use of automated
teller machines, it said in a  statement  today.  The agreement among the banks “has deformed competition,
as well as caused damage to the merchants that take card
payments and consumers,” the Riga-based council said in a
statement on its website today.    Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , the biggest bank in the Baltics, Citadele AS,
a lender majority owned by the Latvian state, and SEB AB were
among the lenders cited in the statement. Those three banks
accounted for about 4.5 million lati of the 5.5 million lati in
total fines, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
