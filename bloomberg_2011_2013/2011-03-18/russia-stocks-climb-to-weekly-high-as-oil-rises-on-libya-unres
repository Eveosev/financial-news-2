Russian stocks rose to their
highest in more than a week after the United Nations voted to
ground Libya leader Muammar Qaddafi’s air force amid escalating
tension in the region, driving crude prices higher.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  of 30 stocks advanced 0.6 percent to
1,747.32 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its highest level
since March 9. OAO Lukoil, Russia’s second-biggest oil producer,
and OAO Sberbank, its largest lender, both rallied by at least
1.5 percent. OAO Novatek, the country’s second-largest natural
gas producer, jumped 3.8 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS
Index increased 0.9 percent to 1,962.92.  Oil, Russia’s biggest export revenue earner, gained as much
as $2.24 to $103.66 a barrel in New York after the UN Security
Council voted to ground Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi’s air
force. Crude erased gains after Qaddafi’s regime declared an
immediate cease-fire and said it was willing to talk to rebels.
Prices of crude oil fluctuated in  New York  during the last 2 1-2
hours of Moscow equities trading.  “The fighting in Libya and the threat of instability in  Saudi Arabia  is supporting the oil price at a level which, if it
lasts all year, will generate a budget surplus for Russia,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at Uralsib Financial Corp., Wrote
