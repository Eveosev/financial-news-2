Japanese stocks climbed, paring
their worst weekly performance since 2008, as the yen tumbled
after the  Bank of Japan  and some Group of Seven countries said
they began intervening in  currency markets  while the country
battles to control a nuclear accident.  Kyocera Corp., an electronics maker that gets more than
half of its sales abroad, advanced 5.2 percent. Daikin
Industries Ltd.,  Japan ’s largest maker of air conditioners,
soared 8.7 percent. Tokyo Electric Power Co.,  Asia ’s largest
utility which is struggling to prevent a meltdown at a nuclear
power plant, rose for the first time this week. Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s largest bank by market value,
climbed 3 percent.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 2.7 percent to 9,206.75
at the 3 p.m. market close in Tokyo. The broader Topix Index
climbed 2.4 percent to 830.39, with all 33 industry groups in
the gauge advancing. The measures have lost 10 percent and 9.3
percent this week respectively, the biggest weekly slide since
October, 2008.  “The yen’s move gave a temporary relief to the market, and
reacted to the recent overselling,” said Shintaro Takeuchi, who
helps manage about $20 billion at Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire
Insurance Co. “But the impact on corporate profits from the
nuclear power plant fallout is far bigger than the strong yen,”
and the market’s gains won’t last too long.  Intervention, Yen  The yen depreciated 3.6 percent to 81.87 per dollar as of 4
p.m. in  Tokyo  from 78.89 yesterday in New York, the biggest one-
day decline since Oct. 28, 2008. It reached 76.25, the highest
level against the dollar since World War II, yesterday in New
York as increased risk of radiation leaks from a crippled
nuclear power station boosted speculation Japanese investors
will bring home overseas assets.  Against the euro, Japan’s currency depreciated to as low as
115.27 from 110.38 at the close of trading yesterday in Tokyo.  The Topix lost 9.8 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with a gain of 1.3 percent by the S&P 500 and a drop of
3.2 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Japanese benchmark are valued at 14 times estimated earnings,
compared with 13.1 times for the  S&P 500  and 10.7 times for the
Stoxx 600.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index, a measure of
Japanese option prices, has more than tripled in the past week
as equities tumbled. The gauge slipped 26 percent to 49.95 today,
implying a 14 percent swing in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average in
the next 30 days.  ‘Speedy Reaction’  Kyocera, an electronics maker that gets more than half of
its sales abroad, advanced 5.2 percent to 7,850 yen. Daikin
Industries soared 8.7 percent to 2,397 yen, the most since May
2009. Pioneer Corp., a maker of audio and video equipment which
derives more than half its revenue abroad, surged 9.8 percent to
370 yen, the largest increase since October 2009.  “The speedy reaction to the yen’s gains and the
coordinated intervention showing international support for Japan
gave a short-term boost to  market sentiment ,” said Hideo Arimura, who helps oversee about $2.2 billion at Mizuho Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo. “But the actual economic damages from
the earthquake, nuclear fallout and power cuts are still unclear,
and the yen’s move is still hard to assess. The mid- to long-
term outlook of the market remains uncertain.”  Tepco Surges  Tokyo Electric Power soared by the daily limit of 150 yen,
or 19 percent, to 948 yen, the biggest gain since at least
September 1974, leading gains in the members in the  Nikkei 225. (NKY) 
It was the most-actively traded stock in Japan. Toshiba Corp., a
nuclear reactor supplier, jumped 7.5 percent to 360 yen, the
steepest rise since June 2009. Japan Steel Works Ltd., a maker
of components for nuclear pressure vessels, leapt 11 percent to
594 yen, rising the most since November 2008.  Japanese soldiers and firefighters from Tokyo, using 30
fire engines, doused sea water on reactor No. 3 at Japan’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi power plant, site of an explosion earlier
this week. Steam was observed rising from the structure. Tokyo
Electric Power said it may finish reconnecting a power line to
the cooling system of the No. 2 reactor today. The power link
would be used to restart pumps needed to pour cooling water on
overheating fuel rods.  Stable Condition  The  International Atomic Energy Agency  said the situation
at three loaded reactor cores in Japan’s Fukushima nuclear
complex has been “relatively stable” in the last 24 hours. All
of the units are damaged and don’t have cooling, IAEA Director
Graham Andrew said yesterday at a press briefing in Vienna. The
situation remains “very serious,” he said.  Oil explorers had the largest increase among the Topix
index’s 33 industry groups. Inpex Corp., Japan’s largest energy
exploration company, leapt 6.8 percent to 580,000 yen. Japan
Petroleum Exploration Co., the second-biggest oil driller,
soared 7.4 percent to 3,825 yen.  Crude oil for April delivery gained as much as 2.2 percent
to $103.66 a barrel, in electronic trading in  New York  today.  Banks were the second-biggest support for the Topix’s gain.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group climbed 3 percent to 374 yen.
Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Japan’s third biggest bank, gained
3 percent to 139 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
