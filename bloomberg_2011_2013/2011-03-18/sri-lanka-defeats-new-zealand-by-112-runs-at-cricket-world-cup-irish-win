Kumar Sangakkara scored 111 to pace
Sri Lanka to a 112-run victory over  New Zealand  and tie  Australia  for the lead of group A at the Cricket World Cup.  Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene combined for 145 runs for
Sri Lanka, which reached 265-9 in its 50 overs at Wankhede
Stadium in Mumbai. New Zealand could only respond with 153 runs
in 35 overs, with Ross Taylor the high scorer on 33.  Sri Lanka and Australia each have 9 points, although Ricky
Ponting’s team has played one fewer match. New Zealand and  Pakistan  are both on 8 points, with the Kiwis having played all
six of their group games.  In a group B match today at Eden Gardens in Kolkata,
Ireland defeated the Netherlands by six wickets with 14 balls
remaining. Paul Stirling’s 101 runs led the Irish, which ended
307-4 in response to the 306 posted by the Netherlands. Ireland,
which got two wins at the  World Cup , and the Netherlands, which
couldn’t get a victory, finished at the bottom of group B.  The top four teams in each of the seven-squad groups move
to the quarterfinals in the event, which ends next month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
