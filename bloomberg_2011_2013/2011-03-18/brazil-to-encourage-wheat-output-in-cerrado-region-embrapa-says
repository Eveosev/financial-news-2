  Brazil , the world’s second-biggest
wheat importer, is seeking to encourage growers to boost output
in the center-western Cerrado region to cut dependency on
foreign supplies, an official of the government’s agricultural
research company said.  Embrapa, as the company is known, will start five wheat-
producing units in the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do
Sul, Goias,  Minas Gerais  and the Federal District in the next
four months, said Executive Director Kepler Euclides Filho. The
units will give growers access to “modern” technology to
cultivate wheat in the region, he said.  The plan is to double Brazil’s wheat production within five
years as the country imports more than half its domestic needs
and struggles with international price swings, Euclides Filho
said. The Cerrado region produces less than 5 percent of the
country’s output, while the southern states of Parana and Santa
Catarina account for 85 percent of output.  “There’s a lot of interest from farmers to produce wheat
in Cerrado,” Euclides Filho said in an interview in  Sao Paulo 
today. “It’s a new opportunity we have to increase local
production and discourage imports.”    Argentina  provides 90 percent of Brazil’s wheat imports.
Brazil produced 5.8 million metric tons of the grain last year,
and local demand was 10.4 million tons, said Lucilio Alves, a
crop researcher for Sao Paulo University’s Cepea research unit.    Egypt  is the world’s largest importer of wheat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
