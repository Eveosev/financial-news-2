  Regions Financial Corp. (RF)  is the
worst performer today in the  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  as the Alabama-based
lender didn’t announce a dividend increase or a plan to repay a
U.S. government bailout.  Regions dropped 7 cents, or about 1 percent, to $7.28 at
2:48 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading and has
risen 4 percent this year. It was one of three companies to
decline today among 24 in the KBW index, which rose 1.5 percent.  Regional lenders including KeyCorp in Ohio and  SunTrust
Banks Inc. (STI)  in Georgia announced plans today to begin repaying
funds received under the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief
Program. Regions, based in Birmingham, holds $3.5 billion in
government bailout funds and has paid a dividend of a penny a
share since June 2009.  “Regions did not propose any immediate capital action,”
the bank said in a statement. “The company’s position of
repaying the government’s TARP investment in a prudent manner,
on shareholder-friendly terms, remains unchanged.”  The bank was one of 19 U.S. lenders to submit capital plans
to the  Federal Reserve , which analyzed the companies’ financial
strength as part of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and
Review. Regions, led by Chief Executive Officer Grayson Hall,
lost $539 million in 2010 and a total of $6.63 billion in the
two preceding years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
