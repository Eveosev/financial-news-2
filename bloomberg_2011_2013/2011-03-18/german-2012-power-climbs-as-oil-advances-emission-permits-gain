German power for next year advanced
as rising European emissions prices signaled higher generation
costs at plants that burn coal and natural gas in  Europe ’s
biggest market.  Baseload power for 2012 rose 0.8 percent to 57.40 euros
($81.13) a megawatt-hour, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg at 5 p.m. Berlin time. Baseload is generated and sold
around the clock. The price reached 59.80 euros on March 16, the
highest since August 2009.    E.ON AG (EOAN) ,  RWE AG (RWE)  and other German utilities need to replace
25 percent of the nation’s nuclear capacity after  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  on March 15 decided to keep seven of the country’s
oldest reactors off line during a three-month safety evaluation.
Some of them may never restart, Deutsche Bank AG analysts said.  European Union carbon allowances for December rose as much
as 2.9 percent to 17.27 euros a metric ton and last traded at
17.24 euros at 5 p.m. on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London. Rising emission prices makes power generation from
fossil fuels more expensive as utilities need permits to cover
their emissions.  Bloomberg tracks prices from brokers including ICAP Plc,
GFI Group Inc., Spectron Group Ltd., Tullett Prebon Plc and
Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
