  Thailand ’s baht was headed for its
biggest gain in four weeks as the nation’s yield premium over
developed economies spurred overseas investors to add to
holdings of the nation’s fixed-income assets.  The baht advanced for a third day after global funds bought
$109 million more local bonds than they sold this week through
yesterday, according to data from the  Thai Bond  Market
Association. The nation’s 2.5 percent benchmark interest rate
compares with a maximum of 0.25 percent in Japan and the U.S.  “Thailand’s yield premiums attracted fund inflows,
supporting the baht,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at
Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo .  The baht strengthened 0.5 percent this week and gained 0.1
percent today to 30.30 per dollar as of 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency, this
week’s best performer among  Asia ’s most-traded currencies
excluding the yen, may trade between 30.20 and 30.50 next week,
Nishihama said.    Government bonds  rose, pushing five-year yields to the
lowest level since January, as a March 11 earthquake and
subsequent radiation leak at a nuclear plant spurred demand for
the safest assets, said Nishihama.  The yield on the 3.125 percent note due December 2015
dropped seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, this week
and one basis point today to 3.29 percent. It touched 3.265
percent yesterday, the lowest level since Jan. 24, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, fell 23 basis points from
a week ago to 2.5 percent. The rate added six basis points from
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
