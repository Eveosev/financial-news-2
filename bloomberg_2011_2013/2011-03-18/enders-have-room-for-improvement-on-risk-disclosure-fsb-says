Banks have “room for improvement”
on their disclosure of risks they face from structured credit
products such as collateralized debt and loan obligations, the
 Financial Stability Board  said.  “The quality of public risk disclosures varies across
institutions and jurisdictions and there remains room for
improvement,” the FSB said in a  statement  on its  website  today.  Areas of “particular” concern include risks to lenders
from off-balance-sheet vehicles, the FSB said. The “financial
industry, investors, and auditors” should work together to
improve the situation, said the group.  The FSB was set up in 2009 by the Group of 20 nations to
spearhead changes to financial rules in the wake of the crisis,
and coordinate their implementation worldwide. Today’s
publications are part of series of peer reviews the FSB is
conducting to assess rule implementation. It also today
published a  review  of residential mortgage underwriting and
origination practices in FSB member countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
