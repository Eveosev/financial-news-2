  American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer bailed out by U.S. taxpayers, said first-quarter
catastrophes including the earthquake in  Japan  will cost the
company about $1 billion.  The Japan quake is responsible for about $700 million of
the sum, the New York-based insurer said yesterday in a
statement. The total also includes claims from a temblor in  New
Zealand , floods in Australia and winter storms in the U.S. It
excludes losses from participation in the Japanese Earthquake
Reinsurance Co. which handles policies on residential dwellings.  AIG is increasingly reliant on property-casualty operations
after selling its biggest non-U.S. life businesses to help repay
a $182.3 billion bailout. The company is adding to investments
in Japan with the planned purchase of the 45 percent of Fuji
Fire & Marine Insurance Co. that it doesn’t already own.  “Our preliminary loss estimate will change as the industry
losses from JERC for earthquake damage to personal dwellings
become known,” Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  said in
the statement.  The maximum pretax loss that AIG can take on residential
coverage in Japan is about $575 million under U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, including costs from Fuji Fire,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
