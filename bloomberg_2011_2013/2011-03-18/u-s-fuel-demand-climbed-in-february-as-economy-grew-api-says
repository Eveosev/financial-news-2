U.S. fuel demand rose in February
as economic growth bolstered gasoline and diesel use, according
to the  American Petroleum Institute .  Total deliveries of petroleum products, a measure of
demand, climbed 4.4 percent to 19.7 million barrels a day last
month from a year earlier, the highest February total in three
years, the industry-funded group said today in a report.  Gasoline consumption increased 4.2 percent to 9.01 million
barrels a day from the same month last year.  “It looks like we’ve turned a corner, and it’s showing up
in fuel deliveries,”  John Felmy , chief economist with the
Washington-based API, said in a telephone interview. “The
gasoline number is especially encouraging because it’s closely
tied to retail sales. We also continue to see strong demand for
low-sulfur distillate and jet fuel.”  Total demand for distillate fuel, a category that includes
diesel and heating oil, rose 3.8 percent to 4 million barrels a
day. Consumption of ultra-low sulfur diesel, the type used on
highways, surged 18 percent to average 3.2 million barrels a
day, the report showed.  Heating oil consumption surged 31 percent to 775,000
barrels a day.  “The only negative in the report is the fact that people
were spending a lot more on heating oil,” Felmy said. “It’s
been a real cold winter.”  Jet-fuel use climbed 7.1 percent to an average 1.44 million
barrels a day last month compared with the same period in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
