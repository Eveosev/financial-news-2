  China  Resources Snow Brewery, a
joint venture between  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  and China Enterprises, is
increasing prices by 10 percent to compensate for raw-material
and business costs, the  Financial Times  reported.  China’s biggest brewer is gradually increasing prices to
gauge consumer reaction to the rises that are close to double
the rate of inflation, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
