Guinea is planning a review of all
its mining licenses and may require the government being a
minority shareholder in contracts, following advice from  George Soros , the billionaire philanthropist, the FT said.  All companies will have to submit to higher transparency
standards along with their country of origin, the FT reported.
The plan may impact a $1.35 billion iron-ore arrangement between
Aluminum Corp. of  China  and Rio Tinto Group, and  Vale SA (VALE3) â€™s $2.5
billion iron ore deal in the West African nation, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
