The new owners of London’s Gatwick
Airport are paying themselves a 330 million pound ($536 million)
dividend 15 months after agreeing to buy Britain’s second
biggest airport from BAA Ltd. in a 1.5 billion pound deal, the  Daily Telegraph  reported, citing an unnamed industry source.  The five owners, led by a 42 percent controlling
shareholder, Global Infrastructure Partners, are getting the
payout as part of a 1.2 billion pound refinancing, the Telegraph
reported.  BAA and its major shareholder,  Ferrovial SA (FER) , put Gatwick up
for sale in September 2008, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
