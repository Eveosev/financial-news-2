  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  Chief
Executive Officer Peter Voser believes the $116 oil price caused
by the Middle East crisis will soon ease but warned of a longer-
term shock where supply can’t meet demand, the  Daily Telegraph 
reported, citing Voser in an interview.  Lack of investment over the past few years will most likely
be the biggest cause of high oil prices, the newspaper cited
Voser as saying.  Voser said he’s confident the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries would be able to compensate for the loss of
one million barrels a day of production from Libya, the
Telegraph reported.  Oil rose to a 29-month high in New York yesterday on
concern that the unrest in  Libya  will spread to other oil
producers in the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
