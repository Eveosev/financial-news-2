The U.S. Interior Department may be
forced to reject seven off-shore drilling permit applications
because they are flawed or incomplete, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing court papers filed late today.  A judge has ordered the administration to decide on the
applications before the end of the month, the newspaper said. In
filings, the U.S. asked the judge to stay the order while it is
appealed, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
