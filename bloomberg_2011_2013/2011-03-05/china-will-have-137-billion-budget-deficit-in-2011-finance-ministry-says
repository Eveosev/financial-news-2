  China  plans to run a budget deficit
of 900 billion yuan ($137 billion) in 2011, the Ministry of
Finance said in Beijing today.  Fiscal spending is targeted to rise 11.9 percent to 10
trillion yuan and revenue will grow 8 percent to 8.97 trillion
yuan, the ministry said in a budget report presented to the
National People’s Congress.  China’s ruling Communist Party pledged in December to
continue a pro-active fiscal policy this year as it seeks to
raise incomes and consumption in the world’s most populous
nation. Premier  Wen Jiabao  said Feb. 27 that ensuring fair  income distribution  will aid social stability.  The budget deficit will be 2 percent of the nation’s gross
domestic product, according to the report. That compares with
the 2.8 percent the government targeted in 2010.  The central government will issue 200 billion yuan of bonds
on behalf of local governments this year, according to today’s
budget plan.  The government started issuing bonds on behalf of local
governments in 2009 to help them fund infrastructure projects as
part of a stimulus plan to cushion the economy from the global
financial crisis. The  finance ministry  issued 200 billion yuan
in both 2010 and 2009.  The amount of outstanding treasury bonds at the end of 2011
is estimated to be 7.77 trillion yuan, the ministry said.  The government will transfer 150 billion yuan from its
stabilization fund this year, taking total fiscal revenue to
9.12 trillion yuan, the finance ministry said.  --Zheng Lifei, Huang Zhe. With assistance from Kevin Hamlin in
