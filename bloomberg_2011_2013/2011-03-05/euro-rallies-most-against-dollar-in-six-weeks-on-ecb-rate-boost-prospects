The euro climbed the most versus the
dollar in six weeks as the  European Central Bank  said it may
raise interest rates next month, while Federal Reserve officials
signaled the  U.S. economy  still needs stimulus.  The Swiss franc rose to a record against the U.S. currency
as turmoil pushed oil to a 29-month high. The greenback fell
versus most major peers on speculation a payrolls gain wasn’t
enough to spur the Fed to raise rates soon. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  wouldn’t rule out more Treasury buys to support growth.
U.S. retail sales rose last month, data next week may show.  “The takeaway from a very busy week is still a clear
tightening signal from the ECB, relatively dovish comments from
Bernanke and a U.S. jobs report that’s positive, but not
positive enough to alter U.S. rate expectations,” said  Vassili Serebriakov , a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo & Co . in New
York. “There’s scope for some further near-term dollar weakness
or euro strength.”  The euro climbed 1.7 percent to $1.3987, the most since the
five days ended Jan. 21, from $1.3754 on Feb. 25. It added 2.5
percent to 115.13 yen, from 112.35. The dollar appreciated 0.8
percent to 82.32 yen, from 81.68.  The franc advanced 0.4 percent to 92.45 centimes per dollar
and touched a record 92.02 centimes on March 2. It tends to gain
during periods of financial stress because  Switzerland ’s export-
reliant economy doesn’t need foreign capital to balance the
current account, the broadest measure of trade.  Rate Outlook  The euro gained versus 15 of its 16 most-traded counterparts
on March 3 after ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said an
“increase of  interest rates  in the next meeting is possible”
to counter inflation. He spoke in  Frankfurt  after the ECB left
its key rate at 1 percent, where it’s been since May 2009.  The Fed has held its benchmark at zero to 0.25 percent
since December 2008, and won’t increase it until the first
quarter of 2012, according to the weighted average in a
Bloomberg survey of 74 economists.  “Trichet’s comments were a game-changer,” said Carl Forcheski, a director on the corporate currency sales desk at
Societe Generale SA in New York. “The U.S. has 407,000 jobs
created over the last three months -- that’s good, but I’m not
popping the champagne bottle.”  Employers in the U.S. added 192,000 positions in February,
the most since May, after a revised gain of 63,000 in January,
Labor Department data showed yesterday. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey was for 196,000. The  unemployment rate 
unexpectedly fell to 8.9 percent, the lowest since April 2009.  ECB ‘Out Front’  “The unemployment number was by no means a blowout number
that’s going to make the Fed consider tightening anytime soon,”
said Boris Schlossberg, director of research at online currency
trader GFT Forex in  New York . “That leaves the ECB way out
front in terms of interest-rate differential.”  Bernanke, in two days of semiannual monetary-policy
testimony to congressional committees this week, said rising
commodities won’t derail the recovery. He reiterated that while
U.S. economic growth will accelerate, he still wants to see a
“sustained period of stronger  job creation .”  The Fed chief also signaled he’ll keep the central bank on
course to finish buying $600 billion of Treasuries through June
to spur growth, and didn’t rule out another round of purchases.  U.S. retail sales increased 1 percent in February, from
0.03 percent the previous month, according to the median
forecast of 63 economists in a Bloomberg survey before the
Commerce Department reports the data March 11.  Bets on Euro  Futures traders increased bets to the most since January
2008 that the euro will gain versus the dollar, figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the euro compared with
those on a drop -- so-called net longs -- was 51,308 on the week
ended March 1, the most since Jan. 11, 2008.  Crude oil for April delivery rose as much as 7.5 percent
this week to $105.17 a barrel in New York, the highest level
since September 2008, on concern supply will be disrupted.  Libyan rebels seeking to end Muammar Qaddafi’s 41-year rule
clashed yesterday with security forces loyal to him after
repelling government attempts to retake oil hubs in the east.
The conflict has left 6,000 people dead, compared with a 1,000
estimate cited by the  United Nations , the opposition forces’
spokesman, Abdullah Al Mahdi, told Al Jazeera yesterday.    New Zealand ’s dollar reached the weakest in 18 years versus
its Australian counterpart on speculation its central bank will
cut borrowing costs after the second earthquake in six months.  IMF Forecast  The currency, nicknamed the kiwi, fell versus all of its 16
most-traded peers this week after the  International Monetary
Fund  said it will “likely” cut its New Zealand growth forecast
from the current 3 percent after the earthquakes. IMF
spokeswoman  Caroline Atkinson  spoke at a news conference in  Washington  this week.  The kiwi touched NZ$1.3769 per Australian dollar yesterday,
the weakest level since June 1992. It tumbled 1.4 percent on the
week to NZ$1.3735, and fell 1.8 percent to 73.83 U.S. cents.  The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand will reduce its benchmark
rate by 0.15 basis points over the next 12 months, compared with
a prediction for an increase of 54 basis points a month ago,
according to a Credit Suisse Group AG index.  The two quakes may have caused as much as NZ$20 billion
($15 billion) of damage, according to Prime Minister John Key.  To contact the reporters on this story:
