Members of an Ivory Coast youth
group that supports incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo  this
week raided at least eight homes of members of the rival
government of  Alassane Ouattara , according to Anne Ouloto, a
spokeswoman for Ouattara.  The “systematic looting spree” targeted homes in the
commercial capital, Abidjan, she said in a phone interview
today. This morning, members of the group, known as the
Young Patriots, raided the house of Ouattara’s Finance
Minister, Charles Koffi Diby, according to Remi Ahoua, a
resident of the area.  “There were a lot of youth, they carried everything
out of the house,” Ahoua said by phone. People were
carrying air conditioners, chairs, bed sheets and pillows,
he said.  Ouattara, the internationally recognized winner of a
disputed Nov. 28 election, and members of his government
have remained in the Golf Hotel in Abidjan since the vote.
Gbagbo refuses to cede power to Ouattara, alleging election
fraud in parts of the country’s north.  To contact the reporters on this story:
