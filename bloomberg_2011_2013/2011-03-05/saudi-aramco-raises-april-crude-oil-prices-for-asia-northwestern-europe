  Saudi Aramco , the world’s largest
oil exporter, raised official selling prices for all crude
grades for customers in Asia and Northwest Europe for April
shipments and cut prices for customers in the U.S.  Saudi Arabia’s state-owned producer increased the formula
prices for Arab Extra Light, Light and Medium crudes to Asia by
65 cents a barrel, a person familiar with the pricing decision
said today. Arab Light to Asia will sell at the highest since
July 2008 at $1.95 a barrel above the average of the Oman and
Dubai grades, the two Gulf benchmarks used by traders.  Six officials at refineries in Asia polled by Bloomberg
said they expected a price increase reflecting gains in fuel
processing profits. The difference between gasoil and fuel  oil
prices , the so-called black-white spread, rose to the widest
since 2008, suggesting refiners with the ability to break  fuel
oil  into higher value oil products are earning more.  Arab Super Light to Asia will increase by 25 cents a
barrel, to $6.05 a barrel above the Oman and Dubai average and
Extra Light will rise to a $3.95 a barrel premium.  Aramco set the price for its Extra Light crude oil for
April loadings for U.S. buyers at a premium of $2.60 a barrel
over the  Argus Sour Crude Index , 10 cents lower than March
cargoes. The price of Arab Light crude to the U.S. will be at
parity with the Argus index, 30 cents a barrel lower than March.  Oil Climbs  Crude oil for April delivery rose 2.9 percent during
February on the New York Mercantile Exchange to close at $96.97
a barrel on Feb. 28. Oil is up more than 20 percent since unrest
flared up in  Libya  in the middle of last month.  Clashes over the last two weeks between government troops
and forces opposed to Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  have slashed
oil exports from the North African country. Concern protests may
spread to another Middle East producer, such as  Algeria , is
keeping oil at its highest price in almost two and a half years.  Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi on Feb. 22 said his
country and other Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
members would be ready to counter “any disruption anywhere in
the world” by pumping more crude.  Aramco this week offered European refiners additional
cargoes of Arab Light crude for loading this month, two
officials involved in the negotiations said. The official prices
for light grades to Northwest Europe and the  Mediterranean Sea 
gained as oil prices rose and as lighter Libyan crudes were
taken out of the market.  2008 Cuts  As OPEC’s biggest and most influential producer,  Saudi
Arabia  had led the group’s supply cuts in late 2008 to support
prices. At its most recent meeting in December, OPEC left
unchanged the official production quotas that most members are
now exceeding anyway to take advantage of higher prices.  Saudi Arabia pumped 8.43 million barrels of oil a day last
month, 25,000 a day more than in January and about 375,000
barrels a day above its OPEC quota, according to Bloomberg
estimates. Jamie Webster, an analyst at PFC Energy in  Washington , estimates the country is now pumping more than 9
million barrels a day.  A month ago, on Feb. 2, Aramco had cut most of its official
selling-price differentials for crude shipments in March,
raising only the price formulas for cargoes to the U.S.  For U.S. shipments, Aramco has priced its crude since
January 2010 against the ASCI marker, an index of high-sulfur
oil produced in the  Gulf of Mexico , replacing a lighter crude
benchmark of West Texas Intermediate priced by Platts, the
energy-information division of McGraw Hill Cos. WTI also trades
as a futures contract on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The following table gives the differentials of the four
