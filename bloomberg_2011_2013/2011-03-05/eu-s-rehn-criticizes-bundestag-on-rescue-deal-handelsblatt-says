European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  criticized the Bundestag’s
position on the future composition of the EU rescue package,
 Handelsblatt  said, citing an interview with Rehn.  The lower house of Germany’s parliament needs to consider
that several EU member countries “are still in great danger,”
Handelsblatt cited Rehn as saying.  The  Christian Democratic Union  and Free Democratic Party
groupings in the Bundestag said at the end of last month that
they were strictly opposed to extending the capacity of the
rescue package, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
