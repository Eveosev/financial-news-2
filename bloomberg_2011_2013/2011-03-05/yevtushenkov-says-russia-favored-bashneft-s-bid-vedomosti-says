The Russian government favored OAO
Bashneft in its winning bid for the country’s largest
undistributed oil fields last year,  Vladimir Yevtushenkov , the
billionaire owner of the oil producer’s parent company, AFK
Sistema, said in an  interview  with Vedomosti.  It was important for the state to set up another vertically
integrated company to increase competition, while handing over
the Trebs and Titov fields to companies such as OAO Lukoil or
OAO Surgutneftegas “wouldn’t have made a quality difference on
the market,” Yevtushenkov told the daily.  Bashneft, whose assets are mainly maturing fields, needed a
“favor,” similar to those once given to Lukoil and
Surgutneftegas, he told the newspaper.  Bashneft was the only bidder for Trebs and Titov in  Russia ’s Arctic at the December tender. Surgutneftegas failed to
make a necessary cash deposit. Applications from Lukoil, TNK-BP,
and  India ’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp were rejected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
