  Princeton University  defeated
Dartmouth College 77-55 to move within one game of clinching its
first Ivy League Conference title since 2004.  The Tigers must beat Harvard University tonight in Boston
to earn the Ivy title outright and advance to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament. Harvard
defeated the University of Pennsylvania 79-64 last night.  At Edward Leede Arena in Hanover, New Hampshire, Douglas
Davis had 14 points and Ian Hummer and Kareem Maddox each added
12 points for the Tigers (23-5, 11-1 Ivy).  R.J. Griffin was high scorer for the Big Green (5-22, 1-12
Ivy), which has lost 10 straight games.  If Harvard (22-5, 11-2 Ivy) wins tonight, Princeton would
have to defeat Penn (12-14, 6-6 Ivy) on March 8 and then beat
the Crimson in a one-game playoff. A Tigers loss against Penn
would give Harvard its first men’s basketball title in the
program’s 100 years.  At Lavietes Pavilion in  Boston , Laurent Rivard led five
players in double-figures with 21 points followed by Christian
Webster with 14.  Miles Cartwright led the Quakers with 16 points.  In other Ivy League games, Yale University (15-12, 8-5 Ivy)
defeated  Columbia University  (14-13, 5-8 Ivy) 87-84 in double
overtime, and Cornell University (9-18, 5-8 Ivy) beat  Brown
University  (11-16, 4-9 Ivy) 75-66.  To contact the reporter on this story:
