German 2-year notes fell for a
second week, pushing the yield to the highest level in more than
two years, after European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said  interest rates  may be raised in April.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year notes over
2-year debt decreased to 1.51 percentage points, the narrowest
since the week ended Nov. 12. Greek bonds fell on concern higher
borrowing costs may hamper the region’s most-indebted countries.  The ECB’s “unexpectedly hawkish stance is taking its toll
on the short end of the German yield curve,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist in Edinburgh at RIA
Capital Markets Ltd., a broker for banks and investors. “The
ECB is clearly laying the groundwork for an imminent rate hike,
most probably in April.”  The German two-year yield rose 22 basis points, or 0.22
percentage point, to 1.76 percent at 5 p.m. in  London  yesterday.
That’s the biggest increase since the week ended Jan. 14. The
yield on the 10-year bund, the euro region’s benchmark
government security, gained 12 basis points to 3.27 percent.  German  government bonds  have lost investors 2.3 percent
this year through March 3, compared with a 0.7 percent loss for
U.S. Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Greek
has debt returned 1.7 percent over the same period.  Gain in Oil  Rising oil prices, which surged above $100 a barrel in  New
York  this week, and faster economic growth are fanning
inflation, which has breached the ECB’s 2 percent limit for
three straight months.  Consumer prices in the 17-nation euro region increased at
an annual 2.4 percent pace in February, up from 2.3 percent a
month earlier.  “Strong vigilance is warranted,” said Trichet, adding
that any increase in the target lending rate wouldn’t
necessarily be the start of a “series” of moves.  Euribor futures fell, pushing the implied yield on the
contract expiring in December 2011 up 23 basis points this week
to 2.17 percent as traders added to bets that the ECB will boost
borrowing costs. It was 1.33 percent at the end of 2010.  Forward contracts on the euro overnight index average, or
Eonia, signal investors think the ECB will increase the main
refinancing rate by 25 basis points by its July meeting,
Deutsche Bank AG data shows.  Rate Increase Outlook  “The ECB clearly signaled that a 25 basis point rate hike
is in the pipeline for next month’s meeting,” analysts at Royal
Bank of Canada, including  Peter Schaffrik  in London, wrote in an
e-mailed report dated March 3. “Thereafter, the outlook is less
clear, but we expect the Governing Council to move at a pace of
25 basis points per quarter, taking the refi rate to 1.75
percent by the end of 2011.”  Ten-year bund yields are expected “to stay between 3
percent and 3.5 percent, but a break-out to the upside is likely
toward the end of 2011,” the analysts wrote.  Bonds from the region’s most-indebted nations dropped, with
the Greek 10-year yield rising 37 basis points to 12.25 percent.
Since the end of January, Greece’s 10-year bonds have risen on 6
trading days, falling on 18. They decreased for the seventh
straight day yesterday, pushing the yield as high as 12.29
percent, the most since Jan. 11.    Greece ’s two-year yields reached the highest since May 10,
the first trading day after the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund  announced the creation of a bailout
fund to backstop the euro. The yields surged 125 basis points,
or 1.25 percentage points, in the week to 15.45 percent. That’s
the biggest increase since the week ended Jan. 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
