Huawei Technologies Co., the Chinese
phone-equipment maker some U.S. lawmakers claim is a national
security threat, is near to winning a contract to supply  London
Underground  with a mobile network, the Financial Times reported.  Unnamed government officials told the newspaper they expect
plans for the network on London’s subway, known as the Tube, to
go ahead, the FT said. Neither Business Secretary  Vince Cable 
nor government security advisers have raised objections to
Huawei’s involvement, the newspaper reported.  Some U.S. lawmakers have called Huawei a national security
threat as its founder is a former member of the Chinese army,
the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
