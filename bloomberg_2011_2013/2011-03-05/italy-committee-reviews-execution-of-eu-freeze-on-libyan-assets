Italian government and central bank
officials met today to discuss the implementation of a freeze on
Libyan assets agreed by the European Union, the  Finance Ministry 
said today in an e-mailed statement.  The country’s  Financial Security Committee  “will
immediately and effectively implement any new decision of the EU
with regards to the freeze of Libyan assets,” the statement
said.  Italy imposed the EU freeze on March 2, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
