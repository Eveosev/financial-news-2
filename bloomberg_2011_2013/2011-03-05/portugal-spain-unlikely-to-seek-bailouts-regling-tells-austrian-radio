Klaus Regling, chief executive
officer of the European Financial Stability Facility, said that
he currently doesn’t expect  Portugal  or Spain to ask for
bailouts, Austrian state radio ORF reported, citing an
 interview .  “At the moment it looks like” Ireland will be the only
country to have tapped the EFSF, Regling told ORF. “I don’t see
any need at all anymore for Spain” to take money, Regling said,
adding that “Portugal still has to do some work.”  While the EFSF would have sufficient funds for additional
bailouts, giving funds “currently doesn’t look necessary,” he
was cited as saying.  “The markets are speculating that a country like Portugal
may need help,” Regling said. “Other countries that a few weeks
and months ago also were thought by the financial markets to
require help, today are in a different state of development.”  In  Spain  “extensive additional budgetary consolidation and
structural reform measures” have led markets to accept that
“Spain doesn’t need any money,” he said in the interview.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
