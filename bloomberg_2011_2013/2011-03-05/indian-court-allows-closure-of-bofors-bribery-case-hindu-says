A Delhi court has allowed
investigators to close a bribery case related to a 1986 arms
deal, the Hindu newspaper reported, citing Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate Vinod Yadav.  Yadav backed the Central Bureau of Investigation’s
application to withdraw its prosecution of an Italian
businessman, Ottavio Quattrocchi, who was charged with taking
bribes for brokering a deal in which  Sweden ’s Bofors AB won a
$1.3 billion order from the Indian government for howitzer field
guns, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
