A  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  banker who
passed a compact disc with client data to German authorities
through a middle-man continued to spy for them on the Swiss
bank, Tages-Anzeiger reported, citing documents obtained by
German tax authorities.  In addition to handing over the CD, the “mole”
communicated with German officials and gave them more
information, including a 2004 report in which the bank estimated
that 88 percent of German money in its Swiss branches was
untaxed, the paper said.  Credit Suisse spokesman Alex Biscaro declined to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
