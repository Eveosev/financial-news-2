Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s
government is continuing to receive payments for crude oil
exports worth hundreds of millions of dollars, the  Financial
Times  reported, citing senior western oil officials and traders.  Payments are still going to  Libya ’s central bank and
potentially getting into Qaddafi’s direct control, the FT said,
as  United Nations  and European Union sanctions don’t target the
bank and U.S. sanctions don’t affect Libyan firms incorporated
outside the country. Libya shipped more than $770 million worth
of oil in the last two weeks, the newspaper said.  Exports are falling as tanker owners stop dealing with
Libya but Chinese and Indian companies are still buying the
regime’s crude, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
