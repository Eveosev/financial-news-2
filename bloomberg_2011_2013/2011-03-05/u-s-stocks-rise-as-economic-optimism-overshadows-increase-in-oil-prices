U.S. stocks rose this week, with a
rebound in the final hour of trading yesterday preserving the
advance, after improvements in employment and service industries
overshadowed concern that oil’s surge will slow economic growth.  Equities pared their weekly gain yesterday as crude rose to
a 29-month high of $104.42 a barrel.  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  and Merck & Co.
led advances in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average , gaining at
least 2.7 percent.  Agilent Technologies Inc. (A)  rose 10 percent,
the most in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, after the maker
of scientific-testing equipment boosted its long-term sales 
and margin forecasts. Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. fell 13
percent on concern about competition from Apple Inc.’s iPad 2.  The S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent to 1,321.15 after losing 1.7
percent the prior week. The Dow climbed 39.43 points, or 0.3
percent, to 12,169.88. Oil futures advanced 6.7 percent,
extending their advance since Feb. 11 to 22 percent.  “It’s a battle between the negative geopolitical
environment versus the very strong economic fundamentals,” said
Benjamin Pace, who helps oversee about $420 billion as the New
York-based chief investment officer of Deutsche Bank Private
Wealth Management. “The economic environment is very equity
friendly. The current geopolitical environment and its impact on  oil prices , not so much.”  Production Cut  The  S&P 500  lost 0.7 percent yesterday as crude oil jumped
after fighting in Libya cut crude production in the African
country by as much as 1 million barrels a day, spurring concern
that there will be a slowdown in U.S. consumer spending, which
makes up about 70 percent of the world’s biggest economy. The  stock index  had surged 1.7 percent on March 3 for the biggest
increase in three months, pushed up by reports showing claims
for first-time jobless benefits decreased.  The S&P 500 has gained 5.1 percent this year, amid
government stimulus measures, improving economic data and
higher-than-estimated corporate earnings. Per-share profit
topped estimates at 71 percent of the 470 companies in the S&P
500 that have reported results since Jan. 10, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Oil is the ultimate wildcard in terms of being a drag on
the market and economic growth,” said  Stephen Wood , the New
York-based chief market strategist for Russell Investments,
which manages $155 billion. “That can overshadow the modest yet
measurable improvement in the economy which we now see being
registered in an improving labor market.”  Jobless Rate Falls  The jobless rate unexpectedly declined to 8.9 percent, the
lowest level since April 2009, and employers added 192,000 jobs
in February, Labor Department figures showed yesterday.
Applications for  unemployment benefits  fell by 20,000 to 368,000
in the week ended Feb. 26, the Labor Department report said on
March 3. Economists forecast claims would rise to 395,000,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The
total number of people receiving  unemployment insurance  fell to
the lowest level since October 2008.  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses rose to 59.7, the highest level since
August 2005, from 59.4 in January. Economists forecast the gauge
would fall to 59.3, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. A reading above 50 signals growth. The
institute’s factory index rose to 61 in February, the highest
since May 2004, from January’s 60.8, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  The better-than-estimated data pushed the Citigroup
Economic Surprise Index to its highest level ever yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Pfizer, Merck  Pfizer rallied 4.2 percent to $19.66 for the biggest gain
in the Dow. At least four states are considering legislation
backed by the world’s biggest drugmaker that would impede the
efforts of Medicaid and private insurers to save money by
widening the use of generic drugs. Merck, the second-biggest
U.S. drugmaker, gained 2.7 percent to $33.06. Health-care
companies rose the most among 10 industries in the S&P 500,
climbing 2.4 percent.  Agilent Technologies rose 10 percent to $46.75, the biggest
gain in the S&P 500. The world’s biggest maker of scientific-
testing equipment increased its long-term sales and operating
margin forecasts at a meeting with analysts, JPMorgan said in a
note to clients.    JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU) , the network-analysis company which
bought Agilent’s network solutions test unit last year, also
climbed 10 percent, ending the week at $27.37.  Energy Stocks  Higher oil prices drove energy shares in the S&P 500 to a
0.4 percent gain. The stocks have surged 34 percent since March
9, 2010 -- the one-year anniversary of the index’s slump to a
12-year low -- leading the S&P 500’s advance.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the
second-largest U.S. oil company, climbed 1.6 percent $103.75
this week.  Financial stocks had the biggest decline in the S&P 500,
dropping 1.6 percent. The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  slumped 2.4 percent as
23 of its 24 stocks retreated.    Citigroup Inc. (C)  dropped 3.4 percent to $4.54. The third-
largest  U.S. bank  was cut to “neutral” from “buy” by
analysts at Bank of America Corp., who also cut  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  to “neutral” from “buy.” Goldman Sachs fell 2.5
percent to $161.    JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the second-biggest U.S. bank,
decreased the most in the Dow, losing 2.5 percent to $45.52.  Motorola Mobility slipped 13 percent to $26.65, the second-
biggest decline in the S&P 500. The mobile-phone maker was cut
to “neutral” from “outperform” by Cowen & Co. analyst  Matthew Hoffman , who cited competition for the company’s Xoom
tablet from Apple’s iPad 2, which will go on sale on March 11.    Hudson City Bancorp Inc. (HCBK)  fell the most in the S&P 500,
sinking 13 percent to $9.88. The largest U.S. bank to forgo a
government bailout said regulators may require it to “reduce its
level of interest-rate risk and funding concentration.” About 98
percent of its borrowed funds are structured putable borrowings,
which may have to be replaced if  interest rates  rise
significantly, Hudson City said. The bank said it would have to
buy back about 26 percent of its borrowings in the next 12
months if interest rates jumped by 3 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
