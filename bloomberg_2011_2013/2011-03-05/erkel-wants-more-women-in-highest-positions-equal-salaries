German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
that equality between men and women has not been completely
achieved in  Germany  as the country is still among those with the
lowest number of women in management positions.  Merkel said today in her weekly podcast that women must
receive the same salary as men for a similar work position and
get better conditions to reconcile employment with family life.
Discussions will be held with large companies in the “near
future” to increase the percentage of women in a management
position, she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
