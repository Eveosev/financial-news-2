Ukraine’s inflation rate fell last
month, sliding below economist estimates, to the lowest level
since July as prices for eggs and sugar dropped.  The rate declined to an annual 7.2 percent from 8.2 percent
a month earlier, the statistics committee in Kiev said on its
website today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 11
economists was for 7.3 percent. Prices rose 0.9 percent
in the month after advancing 1 percent in January.  “We will probably see the annual disinflation trend
through April until the moment when the authorities start
adjusting gas and heating tariffs,” Iryna Piontkivska, an
economist at Troika Dialog in Kiev, said before the release.  Ukraine raised natural-gas prices for households by 50
percent last August and promised the  International Monetary Fund 
they will be increased again in 2011. The government also lifted
electricity prices by 30 percent from February.  Producer prices, an early indicator of inflation, rose an
annual 21 percent in February, advancing 4.8 percent in the
month, the statistics committee said. The government aims to
keep the country’s inflation rate below 10 percent for the
second year and has limited grain export to cap prices.  “There is inflation pressure as prices for food will
grow,” in order to meet the IMF’s $15.2 billion loan
requirement, said Piontkivska.  To contact the reporters on this story:
