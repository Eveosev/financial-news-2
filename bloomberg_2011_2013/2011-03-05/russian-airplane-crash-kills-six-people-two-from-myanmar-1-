An airplane crashed in the Belgorod
region of central  Russia  this morning, killing all six people on
board, including two citizens of Myanmar, Emergency Situations
Ministry spokeswoman Yelena Smirnykh said by telephone.  The Antonov  An-148  regional jet belonged to  OAO VASO , the
Voronezh-based company that produces the aircraft, the
Investigative Committee said on its  website . The jet crashed 140
kilometers (87 miles) from Voronezh, the committee said.  The An-148 was one of two to be delivered to Myanmar’s air
force under a contract signed last year, Interfax reported,
citing an unidentified official close to OAO United Aircraft
Corp., Russia’s state-controlled umbrella company for aviation
designers and manufacturers.  United Aircraft spokesman Maxim Syssoev declined to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
