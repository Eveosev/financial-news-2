Gulf Coast Fractionators, a
partnership between  ConocoPhillips (COP) ,  Devon Energy Corp. (DVN)  and  Targa
Resources Partners LP (NGLS) , said an electric power failure at its
refinery in Mont Belvieu, Texas, required it to shut a
fractionation unit today.  A blown fuse was the cause, the company showed in a filing
to Texas regulators.  Emissions of some gas was required, the filing showed, and
were routed to the refineryâ€™s flare.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
