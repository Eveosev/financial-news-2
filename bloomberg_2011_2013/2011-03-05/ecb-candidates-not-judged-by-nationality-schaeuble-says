Europeans are no longer “judging
the quality of people based on their nationality,” German
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told Le Figaro in response
to a question about the possible next head of the  European
Central Bank .  In an interview with the newspaper, Schaeuble said he
wouldn’t comment directly on the ECB’s succession “until after
the problems of the  euro zone  have been fixed, in late March.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
