Oddbins Properties Ltd., an
unprofitable U.K. wine retailer, is seeking an investor from the
wine trade as part of a rescue plan that is expected to involve
store closures, the  Guardian  reported, without citing anyone.  Oddbins is taking advice from restructuring experts at
 Spectrum Corporate Finance LLP  and Deloitte & Touche LLP and is
expected to make an announcement early next week, the newspaper
reported.  Managing Director Simon Baile, who led a buyout of the
company two years ago,is keen to attract an investor with
knowledge of the business as he looks to differentiate its
stores from supermarket wine aisles, the Guardian reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
