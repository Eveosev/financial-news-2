German rail traffic may see more
disruption in the coming weeks because of strikes by the GDL
train driversâ€™ union,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The union wants to announce the results of a strike ballot
on March 7, the German newspaper said. Stoppages may also hit
freight traffic, according to the report.  Talks over union demands for a 5 percent pay increase with
Deutsche Bahn AG and six private railway operators stalled last
month. The union rejected an offer for a 1.9 percent pay
increase in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
