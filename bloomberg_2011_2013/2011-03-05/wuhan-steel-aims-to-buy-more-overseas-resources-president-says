Wuhan Iron & Steel Group Corp. will
continue to acquire  iron ore  resources overseas in an effort to
become self sufficient, President Deng Qilin said.  The Chinese steelmaker, which currently imports more than
85 percent of its iron ore, aims to be able to supply all of its
own needs in three to five years so that it doesn’t need to buy
from foreign “monopolies,” Deng said in an online chat today
on the website of the National People’s Congress.  Vale SA, Rio Tinto Group and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
biggest iron ore suppliers, abandoned an annual pricing system
for Chinese steelmakers last year in favor of quarterly
agreements as spot prices for the material rose. Wuhan Steel
accelerated its buying of assets during the financial crisis to
help reduce its reliance on overseas suppliers and now owns or
has stakes in eight iron ore mines abroad, Deng said.  Overseas iron ore companies are a “monopoly,” he said.
“They can raise prices as much as they want. There is no room
for negotiation.” Deng is also the chairman of the China Iron &
Steel Association.  Foreign suppliers are now planning to establish a base at a
Chinese port from which they can sell ore at spot prices, Deng
said. This plan will hurt  China ’s steelmakers to an extent that
is “too much to afford,” he said.  Wuhan Steel agreed last month to jointly develop mining
projects in  Canada  with Century Iron Mines Corp., after entering
into an agreement in January with Adriana Resources Inc. to
cooperate on developing, constructing and operating the Lac
Otelnuk iron ore project in Canada.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
