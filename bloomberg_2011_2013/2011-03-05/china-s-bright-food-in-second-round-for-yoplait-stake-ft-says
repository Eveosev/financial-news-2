  China ’s Bright Dairy & Food Co. is
in the second round of bidding for the 50 percent stake in
yogurt maker Yoplait being sold by PAI Partners, Chairman Wang Zongnan told the Financial Times.  The government-owned food company is also in talks with
other European dairy firms and seeking foreign acquisitions in
wine and sugar, Wang told the  FT . Bright Dairy plans to hold on
to management at Yoplait and any foreign purchase as it lacks
international market knowledge, the newspaper quoted him as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
