  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA’s Electrabel SA unit
will resist any Belgian government demand to pay more than a
245-million-euro ($342 million) yearly levy on nuclear power
producers that’s already been agreed, Electrabel chief executive
Sophie Dutordoir told  De Tijd .  Dutordoir told the newspaper in an interview that “for us
the pact remains valid, because nothing has changed in the
fundamental conditions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
