Any elections in  Zimbabwe  should be
overseen by foreign monitors and take place only after a new
constitution has been put in place,  Newsday  reported, citing
South African Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe.  Motlanthe said the elections would be a “watershed”
similar to the 1980 vote that saw Mugabe assume power after a
protracted war the country then known as Rhodesia, Harare-based
Newsday said on its website. Zimbabwe’s election would need an
“international presence on the same scale,” Newsday quoted
Motlanthe as saying.  Zimbabwe’s first one-man, one-vote elections in 1980 were
supervised by Britain under an agreement brokered in  London  in
1979, effectively ending 90 years of white domination.  To contact the reporter on this story:
