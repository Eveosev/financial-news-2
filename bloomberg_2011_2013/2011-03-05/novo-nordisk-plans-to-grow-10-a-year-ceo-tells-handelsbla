Novo Nordisk A/S, a Danish
drugmaker, wants to grow 10 percent per year “on its own,”
Handelsblatt reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive
Officer Lars Rebien Soerensen.  Growth in the next years will come from established
products such as insulin, and from new developments such as the
Victoza diabetes treatment, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
