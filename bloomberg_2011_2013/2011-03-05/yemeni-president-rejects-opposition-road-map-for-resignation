Yemen’s President Ali Abdullah Saleh
rejected a plan for his resignation that the opposition said
would lead to a peaceful transition to democracy.  The plan is a “blatant overthrow of democracy and
constitutional legitimacy,” the official  Saba news service 
cited an unidentified official at the presidential office as
saying. The country’s reference is the constitution and
“deviating” from it “poses grave risks,” it said.  Yemen’s opposition coalition gave Saleh a plan outlining a
smooth transfer of power based on a statement by the president
that he will not seek an extension or transfer power to his son,
Mohammed al-Sabri, a spokesman for the coalition, said in an e-
mailed statement on March 3. The plan would see Saleh out of
office before his term ends in 2013.  About a dozen people have been killed in Yemen in more than
three weeks of protests against Saleh’s three-decade rule. The
demonstrations were inspired by the popular uprisings that
overthrew the presidents of Tunisia and  Egypt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
