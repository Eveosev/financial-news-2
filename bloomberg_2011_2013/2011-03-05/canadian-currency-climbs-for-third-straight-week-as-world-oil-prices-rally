  Canada ’s dollar rose for a third
week against the greenback as crude oil, the nation’s biggest
export, surged on concern unrest in  Libya  will spread to other
North African and Mideast nations and curb shipments.  The loonie slid from a three-year high on March 1 as Bank
of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  reiterated that a strong currency
poses challenges to exports while keeping borrowing rates
unchanged. The Canadian dollar dropped against most of its major
counterparts including the euro before a report next week
forecast to show employers added fewer jobs in February than the
previous month.  “The Canadian dollar is still very resilient,” said  George Davis , chief technical analyst for fixed income and
currency strategy at Royal  Bank of Canada  in Toronto. “We
continue to see very firm commodity prices and crude  oil prices .
A lot of people are worried we may see some more unrest in the
Middle East over the weekend, so I think that backdrop is
helping the Canadian dollar.”  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, appreciated 0.4 percent to
97.34 cents per  U.S. dollar  yesterday, from 97.74 on Feb. 25. It
touched 96.84 cents on March 1, the strongest level since
November 2007. One Canadian dollar purchases $1.0273.  Crude oil for April delivery increased for a third week,
advancing 7.4 percent to $105.08 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  after touching a 29-month high. Crude has
gained 28 percent from a year ago.  Canada’s dollar reached its highest level since November
2007 hours before the Bank of Canada decided to hold borrowing
costs steady. A day earlier, the government said the economy
expanded more than expected in the fourth quarter at a 3.3
percent annual rate.  BOC Rate Decision  The Bank of Canada, which led the Group of Seven nations
with three interest-rate increases last year, has kept its
target rate for overnight lending between commercial banks at 1
percent since September.  Exporters still face “considerable challenges” from a
currency trading near three-year highs and “poor relative
productivity,” Carney and five deputies said in a statement.  The rate on the June 2011 bankers’ acceptance contract
dropped to 1.46 percent, from 1.50 percent the day before the
Bank of Canada’s decision. So-called Bax contracts have settled
an average of about 0.20 percentage point above the central
bank’s target rate since 1992, Bloomberg data show.  “It’s a self-defeating argument trying to buy the Canadian
dollar on the expectations that they’re going to raise  interest
rates ,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , senior market analyst at
Interactive Brokers Group LLC in Greenwich,  Connecticut . A
stronger loonie “is softening the inflation trajectory all the
time, which inherently means they’re not going to have to
tighten rates,” he said.  Loonie Versus Euro  The loonie slid 1.2 percent to C$1.3615 against the euro in
its biggest weekly drop since Jan. 21 as European Central Bank
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled on March 3 that policy
makers may increase the shared currency region’s main
refinancing rate next month from a record low 1 percent to
contain inflation.  Canadian 10-year bonds fell for the first time in three
weeks, pushing the yield on the benchmark up four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.33 percent. The price of the 3.50
percent note maturing in June 2020 slid 33 cents to C$101.14.  Employers added 25,000 jobs in February after an increase
of 69,200 in the previous month, according to the median
forecast of 23 economists before  Statistics Canada ’s March 11
report. The  unemployment rate  may have decreased to 7.7 percent,
from 7.8 percent.  Ivey Index  The Ivey purchasing managers’ index was 69.3 in February
after a January reading of 41.4, according to a statement on the
University of Western Ontario business school’s website
yesterday. Readings of less than 50 indicate purchasing by
governments and companies declined.  In the U.S., Canada’s biggest trading partner, employers
added 192,000 workers in February after a gain of 63,000 in the
previous month, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The
median forecast of 84 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for an increase of 196,000. The unemployment rate unexpectedly
dropped to 8.9 percent last month from 9 percent.  To contact the reporter for this story:
