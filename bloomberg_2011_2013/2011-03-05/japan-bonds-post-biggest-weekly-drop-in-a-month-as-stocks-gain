Japanese bonds completed the biggest
weekly drop in a month as optimism the global recovery is
gaining momentum boosted stocks, reducing investor appetite for
the relative safety of government debt.  Ten-year yields climbed to a two-week high after a U.S.
report showed initial jobless claims unexpectedly declined. Bond
futures retreated for the first time in three weeks after a 2.2
trillion yen ($26.7 billion) sale of 10-year debt on March 1
drew less demand than traders had estimated.  “With the  U.S. economy  not in bad shape, the downside risk
to Japan’s economy is reduced,” said  Ayako Sera , a strategist
in Tokyo at Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which manages about
$331 billion in investments. “The chance that Japanese bond
yields will fall has decreased.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rose 5.5 basis
points this week to 1.295 percent at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. It was the biggest
gain since the period ended Feb. 4. The 1.3 percent security due
March 2021 was at 100.044 yen.  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery fell 0.24 this
week to 139.35 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock
Average of Japanese shares climbed 1.6 percent.  Applications for  unemployment benefits  in the U.S. dropped
by 20,000 to 368,000 in the week ended Feb. 26, the Labor
Department said on March 3.  “The environment is unfavorable for Japanese bonds,”  Kazuhiko Sano , chief strategist at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co.,
wrote in a note to clients.  Auction Result  The auction of 10-year securities on March 1 drew the
lowest price of 99.82 yen, compared with the 99.89 yen projected
by 13 traders in a Bloomberg News survey.  Japan’s government bonds have handed investors a loss of
0.9 percent this year, according to an index compiled by Merrill
Lynch & Co. This compares with a 2.4 percent gain in 2010.  Ten-year yields may climb to 1.6 percent and investors
should reduce the duration of their portfolios, according to
Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. Duration is a gauge of how much a
change in yield affects a bond’s price.  “The risk of the market collapsing to this level, even if
temporarily, is steadily rising,”  Akito Fukunaga , chief rates
strategist at the brokerage unit of RBS in Tokyo, wrote in a
note yesterday to clients. “Investors should not buy on dips
when the 10-year rate reaches 1.35 percent, the top end of the
range up until now.”    Bank of Japan  board member Tadao Noda said on March 3 that
he sees no need for the central bank to alter its monetary
policy. “There is no policy change on the horizon at all,” he
said in Kumamoto, southern Japan.  BOJ policy makers pledged on Oct. 5 to keep rates at
“virtually” zero until consumer prices start to rise about 1
percent annually.  To contact the reporter on this story:
