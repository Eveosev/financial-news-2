  Oil prices  could surge to as much as
$250 a barrel if terrorists attack  oil tankers  and reserves in
Libya and the Middle East, Britain’s International Development
Minister Alan Duncan, a former oil trader, told the Times.  Such a gain in the oil price would cause a “serious
spike” in fuel prices to about 2 pounds ($3.25) per liter,
Duncan said in an interview in the London-based  Times  newspaper.  Oil prices of $200 a barrel are “on the cards” if anyone
is “reckless and foments unrest,” Duncan was quoted as saying
by the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
