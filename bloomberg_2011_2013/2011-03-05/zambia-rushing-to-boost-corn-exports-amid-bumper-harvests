Zambia’s is rushing to boost corn
exports from last year’s record harvest as it prepares for
another “bumper” crop, the country’s Food Reserve Agency said.  “We have export commitments presently amounting to about
300,000 metric tons of maize,” Lazarous Mawele, FRA’s marketing
manager, said via phone from the capital Lusaka today. “This is
in addition to what we have already exported in recent months
out of the 1 million metric tons we started off with.”  Zambia,  Africa ’s largest copper producer, is seeking to
diversify its economy away from mining by increasing subsidies
to farmers. The country harvested a record 2.7 million tons of
corn in the 2009-2010 farming season, finance and planning
minister  Situmbeko Musokotwane  said at a government meeting in
October.  Mawele said Zambia has exported about 200,000 tons of corn
to countries including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya
and  Zimbabwe  since July, Mawele said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
