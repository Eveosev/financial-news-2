Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  increased its stake in dialysis provider  DaVita Inc. (DVA)  above
10 percent as the billionaire chairman empowers deputies to
expand their stock portfolios.  Berkshire held 10.2 million shares of the Denver-based
health care company as of Sept. 28, according to a filing today
from Buffett’s firm. That compares with 9.3 million shares at
the end of the second quarter. The holding climbed to about 
11 percent according to data compiled by Bloomberg.   Buffett, 82, has been ceding more responsibility over
Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire’s $86.2 billion stock portfolio
to Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, whom he brought on in the past
two years to help manage investments. DaVita was among the
largest holdings at Weschler’s hedge fund before he was hired by
the billionaire’s firm in September 2011. Berkshire began
building its stake in last year’s fourth quarter.  “We just we keep moving more money over to them,” Buffett
said of Weschler and Combs in a July interview with Bloomberg
Television’s  Betty Liu .  DaVita has climbed 37 percent this year to $103.61 through
Sept. 28, as the company struck a deal to acquire HealthCare
Partners, which manages medical groups and physician networks.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has advanced 15 percent in 2012.  Peter Grauer, chairman of Bloomberg LP, the parent company
of  Bloomberg News , has served on DaVita’s board since 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
