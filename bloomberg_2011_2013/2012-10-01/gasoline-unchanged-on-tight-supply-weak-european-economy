Gasoline was unchanged, after
swinging between gains and losses, as refinery work kept East
Coast supplies at a four-year low even as  Europe ’s struggling
economy threatens the global recovery and fuel demand.  Prices were stable as Irving Oil Corp. said it expects to
complete planned work at the Saint John refinery by the end of
the month. Futures gained 23 percent in the third quarter as
plant shutdowns reduced supplies on the U.S. East Coast. Euro-
area unemployment reached the highest level on record in August,
according to figures from the European Union’s  statistics office 
today.  “You’ve got record-high unemployment in Europe and
refinery maintenance season can’t be expected to last more than
two or three more weeks,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Gasoline for November delivery settled unchanged at $2.9201
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices swung between
$2.8875 and $2.9564.  Irving’s 298,800-barrel-a-day plant in New Brunswick ships
more than half of its exports to the U.S. East Coast.  “There may be some anticipation that more refineries are
going to be coming back from maintenance,” said Joe Posillico,
senior vice president of energy derivatives at Jefferies Bache
LLC in  New York .  Supplies on the East Coast, including New York Harbor, the
delivery point for futures contracts, are the lowest since
October 2008, Energy Department data show.  European Supplies  Gasoline stockpiles  in independent storage in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp, Europe’s oil-trading hub, are the lowest in
almost a year, according to PJK International BV.  The scarcity of available supply in the in the New York
Harbor pushed the October contract up 19.77 cents, or 6.3
percent, on Sept. 28, the day the contract expired.  The Europe-to-U.S. gasoline arbitrage closed, meaning it’s
no longer profitable to carry the fuel across the Atlantic
Ocean, according to Clarkson Research Services Ltd., a unit of
the world’s largest shipbroker.  Unemployment in the economy of the 17 nations using the
euro was 11.4 percent in August, the same as in June and July,
after those months’ figures were revised higher. The  European
Central Bank  said last month it expects the euro-area economy to
shrink 0.4 percent in 2012, down from a previous forecast of a
0.1 percent contraction. It also halved its growth forecast for
2013, to 0.5 percent.  November-delivery heating oil declined 2.34 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.1358 a gallon.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.1
cent to $3.782 a gallon yesterday, AAA data show. Prices have
fallen 15 of the past 17 days to the lowest level since Aug. 27.
Gasoline reached a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
