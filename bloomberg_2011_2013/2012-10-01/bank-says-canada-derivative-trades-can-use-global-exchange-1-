Canadian derivatives investors will
be allowed to process trades through new global clearinghouses
that are being created to curb the risk of another financial
squeeze, the country’s central bank said.  The  Bank of Canada  said improvements in the new trading
systems are sufficient to protect financial markets, according
to a  statement  from Ottawa today.  Canada  has also  developed  a
domestic clearinghouse.  A global overhaul of rules governing derivatives contracts
mandates the use of central counterparties by derivatives
traders. Regulators have sought tougher rules for over-the-
counter derivatives since the collapse in 2008 of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. and the rescue of  American International
Group Inc. (AIG) , two of the largest traders of credit-default swaps.  “Canadian authorities are committed to clearing
standardized over-the-counter derivative contracts, subject to
appropriate exemptions, through central counterparties, CCPs,”
the Bank of Canada said. “Canadian authorities judge that
global CCPs will provide a safe, robust and resilient
environment for clearing OTC derivatives.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
