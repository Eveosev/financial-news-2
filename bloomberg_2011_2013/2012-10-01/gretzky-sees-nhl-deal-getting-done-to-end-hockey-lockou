Wayne Gretzky , the leading scorer in
the history of the National Hockey League, said he expects NHL
owners and players to reach a deal to end a lockout and resume
playing by Jan. 1.  “I don’t see this lockout being as long as the last one,”
said Gretzky, referring to the 2004-05 season that was canceled.
“I think that ultimately here that both sides will sit down and
get a deal done here so that hockey will be back playing.”  The NHL and its players’ union is taking a break from talks
today after three straight days of negotiations failed to
produce an agreement on a new labor contract.  Gretzky, speaking at an event in Toronto today sponsored by
 Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , said current negotiations won’t be as
difficult as previous talks because some of the difficult issues
have already been addressed. He was asked by reporters whether
the lockout will end in time for the NHL Winter Classic,
scheduled for Jan. 1 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  “I believe in my heart, maybe because I’m such a big
hockey fan, that they will be playing by Jan. 1,” said Gretzky,
51.  Gretzky, an 18-time All-Star, spent the first nine seasons
of his NHL career in Edmonton before moving on to the  Los
Angeles Kings , St. Louis Blues and  New York Rangers . After he
retired he was a managing partner and coach for the  Phoenix
Coyotes .  To contact the reporter on this story:
