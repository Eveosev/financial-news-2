Canadian  stocks  rose to a one-week
high after reports showed an unexpected jump in U.S.
manufacturing and smaller-than-forecast contraction in European
factory data.  Magna International Inc. (MG) , North America’s biggest auto-
parts supplier, added 1.8 percent after agreeing to buy German
automotive pumps producer Ixetic Verwaltungs GmbH.  Canam Group
Inc. (CAM) , a maker of construction products, surged 12 percent as Guy
Gottfried, founder of Rational Investment Group, recommended
buying the stock at an investing conference.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 52.73
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,370.19 in Toronto, the highest
close since Sept. 21. The index has climbed 3.5 percent this
year. Energy stocks contributed the most to the gain as nine of
10 industries in the Canadian equity benchmark advanced.  “We’re taking our direction from the much stronger-than-
expected ISM numbers,” said Barry Schwartz, a fund manager with
Baskin Financial Services Inc. in Toronto. The firm manages
about C$450 million ($458.4 million). “ Canada  is in a pretty
good spot right now. Our neighbors in the U.S. are doing just
fine, thank you very much, and we do enough trade with them that
we can ride on their coattails.”  Manufacturing Expands  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of U.S.
 manufacturing  rose to 51.5 in September from 49.6 a month
earlier, snapping three months of contraction. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey projected a reading of 49.7 for September,
according to the median of 76 forecasts. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  A gauge of  manufacturing  in the 17-nation euro region,
based on a survey of purchasing managers, was at 46.1, above an
initial estimate of 46 on Sept. 20, Markit Economics in  London 
said today.  Magna gained 1.8 percent to C$43.27. The purchase of Ixetic
will add manufacturing sites in  Germany , China and  Bulgaria , the
company said.  Canam surged 12 percent to C$5.67, its biggest gain since
October 2008 on trading volume more than six times higher than
the three-month average. Gottfried said the stock was
undervalued at the Value Investing Congress in New York.  Centerra Gold Inc. (CG)  jumped 2 percent to C$12.56, the highest
close since June. Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.5
percent to settle at $1,783.30 in New York after earlier
touching $1,794.40, highest since Nov. 14.  Bankers Petroleum Ltd. (BNK)  climbed 3.4 percent to C$3.05 and
 Crew Energy Inc. (CR)  rose 5.5 percent to C$7.64.  Paramount Resources
Ltd. (POU)  surged 6.7 percent to C$31.98. Crude for November delivery
rose 0.3 percent to settle at $92.48 a barrel in New York.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s largest energy company, added
0.9 percent to C$32.64 and  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) 
jumped 2 percent to C$30.95.  To contact the reporter on this story:
