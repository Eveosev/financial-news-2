American Airlines , which extended
inspections for loose aircraft seats to 47  Boeing Co. (BA)  757s,
blamed the problem on an incorrectly installed clamp.  American planned yesterday to evaluate eight 757s, and
expanded the reviews “out of an abundance of caution,” the
 Fort Worth , Texas-based carrier said in a statement today. It
didn’t disclose results of the 36 inspections already completed.  The evaluations were triggered after seats came loose from
tracks holding them to the cabin floor on two 757s, including
one where the problem recurred a second time in two weeks. The
clamps, used on 47 of the airline’s 102 757s, were installed on
the foot of a seat-row leg, the carrier said.  “This issue does not seem to be tied to any one
maintenance facility or work group,”  Andrea Huguely , an
American spokeswoman, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
