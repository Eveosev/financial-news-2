Hanergy Holding Group Ltd., a closely
held Chinese renewable-energy company, agreed to buy MiaSole
Inc. for $30 million, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.  The deal is expected to close Oct. 31, according to
documents sent to shareholders cited in the Sept. 28  article ,
and Hanergy will retain all employees of the  Santa Clara ,
California-based thin-film solar manufacturer for 12 months.  Richard Gaertner, chief operating officer of Beijing-based
Hanergy’s U.S. unit, couldn’t confirm the report in an interview
today. Calls to MiaSole weren’t returned today.  This is Hanergy’s second thin-film solar deal in a week. It
completed Sept. 26 its purchase of Solibro, the thin-film unit
of Germany’s  Q-Cells SE (QCE) , which filed for protection from
creditors in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
