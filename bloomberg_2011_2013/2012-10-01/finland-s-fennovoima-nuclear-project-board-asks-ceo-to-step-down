The board of the Fennovoima Oy
nuclear power project in  Finland , in which German utility  EON AG (EOAN) 
holds the biggest stake, asked Chief Executive Officer Tapio Saarenpaeae to step down.  “The rationale for the management change is of a practical
nature, with the picking of a plant supplier now becoming the
main focus,” Chairman Pekka Ottavainen, who also acts as CEO of
Voimaosakeyhtioe SF, which represents more than 60 shareholders
in the project, said by phone from Helsinki.  EON has a 34 percent stake in the project with other
companies grouped in Voimaosakeyhtioe. Fennovoima plans to sell
power at production cost for the lifetime of the plant to its
shareholders, starting early next decade. The company has a
permit to build a nuclear power plant at a greenfield site in
Pyhaejoki in northern Finland, and will this year or next choose
between reactor designs from  Areva SA (AREVA)  and  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  for a
1,600 to 1,800 megawatt unit.  Project manager Juha Nurmi will act as interim CEO, Maira
Kettunen, a company spokeswoman, said by phone from Helsinki.  To contact the reporter on this story:
