Northern Ireland ’s Ulster Unionist
Party has fired the deputy leader of its group in the region’s
power-sharing assembly, a party spokesman said by phone today.  John McAllister was “removed” from his position,
according to the spokesman. The Ulster Unionist Party is the
third-biggest bloc in the 108-seat assembly, with 15 members.  The British Broadcasting Corp. reported that McAllister was
fired by leader Mike Nesbitt after criticising any moves toward
a pact with the Democratic Unionist Party, Northern Ireland’s
biggest political group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
