Australia ’s dollar dropped against
all of its 16 major peers after the country’s central bank cut
interest rates by 25 basis points today.  The so-called Aussie dropped to the lowest in more than
three weeks against its U.S. counterpart after the Reserve Bank
of Australia lowered its benchmark rate to 3.25 percent, the
lowest level since 2009. Only nine of 28 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg predicted the cut. Swaps markets indicated before the
RBA announcement that there was a more than 70 percent chance of
a reduction in the cash rate target, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “We were calling for a 25 basis point cut today, and
that’s what they delivered,” said Callum Henderson, Singapore-
based global head of currency research at Standard Chartered
Plc. “The knee-jerk reaction to the decision is negative” for
the Aussie dollar, said Henderson, who expects the currency to
decline to $1.0250 over the next few days.  The Australian dollar touched $1.0294, the lowest since
Sept. 7, before trading at $1.0306 as of 4:42 p.m. in Sydney,
0.5 percent below yesterday’s close.  The currency reached a 12-month low versus its New Zealand
counterpart, falling as much as 0.9 percent to NZ$1.2402, before
trading at NZ$1.2403. It dropped 0.4 percent to 80.47 yen.  Australian government bonds were little changed, with the
10-year yield at 2.98 percent.  RBA Statement  The RBA statement accompanying today’s decision signaled
that Australia, which has benefited from a once-in-a-century
mining boom, faces weaker economic growth.  “The peak in resource investment is likely to occur next
year, and may be at a lower level than earlier expected,” RBA
Governor Glenn Stevens said in the statement. “Growth in  China 
has also slowed, and uncertainty about near-term prospects is
greater than it was some months ago.”  Swaps data indicate a more than 60 percent chance that the
RBA will lower its benchmark rate again at its next meeting in
November.  The RBA also issued a report today which showed its
commodity price index was at 90.1 in September from a revised
89.2 the month before that was the lowest since 2010.  In neighboring New Zealand, a report showed that commodity
export prices advanced last month, buoying the local currency.
ANZ National Bank Ltd.’s price index rose 3.5 percent to 263 in
September, its highest level since April.  The New Zealand dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, rose 0.4
percent to 83.11 U.S. cents, as Asian stocks gained.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares rose 0.1 percent
following a 0.6 percent advance in the  MSCI World Index (MXWO) 
yesterday.  An increase in New Zealand’s commodity prices “is
certainly a positive for the kiwi dollar,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a Singapore-based currency strategist at  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC)  “The main driver is better risk appetite on
higher equities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
