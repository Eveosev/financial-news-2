Romania ’s ruling coalition continued
to lose public support after a failed attempt to impeach
President Traian Basescu, a survey showed.  The governing Social Democrats and Liberals, who form the
Social Liberal Union, wound win 48 percent of the votes in a
general election, according to a Sept. 20-23 survey by polling
company CSOP published by Evenimentul Zilei newspaper today.
That compares with 54 percent in an IRES survey published on
Aug. 27 and 49 percent in a previous CSOP poll, according to the
newspaper.  The opposition  Liberal Democratic Party , which formed the
Right Romania Alliance with two other parties, would garner 24
percent of the vote after the ruling coalition failed to impeach
Basescu in a referendum because of low turnout. The  People’s
Party , founded by media entrepreneur Dan Diaconescu, would get
12 percent backing, according to the poll.  Romania will hold general elections on Dec. 9.  The survey of 1,021 people was commissioned by the Liberal
Democrats and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points,
according to  Evenimentul Zilei .  To contact the reporter on this story:
