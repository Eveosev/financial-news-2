The U.S.  Postal Service , which may
have lost $15 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30,
offered $15,000 apiece to members of its biggest union to
retire.  About 114,000 American Postal Workers Union members are
eligible for the incentive, according to a Postal Service fact
sheet. That’s about 22 percent of the service’s 530,000-person
workforce.  “We have no idea how many people are going to take
advantage of the offer,” Mark Saunders, a Postal Service
spokesman, said in an interview today. “It’s a personal
decision.”  About 165,000 postal employees, or 31 percent of the
workforce, are eligible for full retirement, Postmaster General
Patrick Donahoe said in August.  The service, which last week defaulted on a payment due to
the  U.S. Treasury  for future retiree health benefits, is trying
to cut $20 billion in annual operating costs by 2015 through
steps that include reducing its workforce and closing processing
plants.  In 2009, the service offered a $15,000 early-retirement
incentive to the same union and one representing mail handlers,
leading 20,876 people to accept, Saunders said.  Representative  Elijah Cummings , the top Democrat on the
House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that oversees
the Postal Service, praised the offer and said Congress must
also pass a postal overhaul bill.  “I applaud the efforts by the U.S. Postal Service and the
American Postal Workers Union to responsibly and compassionately
reduce their workforce in line with declining mail volumes,”
Cummings, of  Maryland , said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
