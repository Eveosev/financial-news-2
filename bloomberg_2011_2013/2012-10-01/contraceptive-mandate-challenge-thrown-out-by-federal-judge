A lawsuit challenging a requirement
that businesses offer employees contraception coverage through
health-care insurance was thrown out by a federal judge.  U.S. District Judge Carol E. Jackson in  St. Louis  dismissed
the lawsuit filed earlier this year by Frank O’Brien and his
O’Brien Industrial Holdings LLC, which alleged the mandate
unconstitutionally violated his religious beliefs and the
Catholic philosophy he applied in running his business.  “This court rejects the proposition that requiring
indirect financial support of a practice, from which the
plaintiff himself abstains according to his religious
principles, constitutes a substantial burden on plaintiff’s
religious exercise,” Jackson said in her 29-page ruling on
Sept. 28.  The contraception requirement is part of President  Barack Obama ’s 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,
intended to create almost-universal health-care insurance
coverage. Attorneys for O’Brien and his business today filed
notice of their intent to appeal the judge’s decision.  The case is O’Brien v. U.S.  Department of Health and Human
Services, 12-cv-476, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
 Missouri  (St. Louis).  To contact the reporter on this story:
