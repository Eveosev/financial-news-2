     Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average closing at a three-week low, after a
survey showed declining sentiment among the nation’s biggest
manufacturers and as China’s factory output contracted amid a
global economic slowdown that sapped export demand.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a construction-machinery maker that gets 14
percent of its sales in China, slid 1 percent. Nippon Shokubai
Co. plunged 13 percent after a deadly fire shut output at one of
the chemical maker’s factories.  Olympus Corp. (7733)  gained 1.3 percent
on Sony Corp.’s plan to invest 50 billion yen ($642 million) in
the endoscope maker.  The Nikkei 225 dropped 0.8 percent to 8,796.51 as of the
trading close in Tokyo, the lowest since Sept. 6. Trading volume
was 15 percent below the 30-day average as markets in China,
 Hong Kong  and South Korea were closed for a holiday. The broader
Topix Index slid 0.7 percent to 732.35, with about three stocks
falling for each that gained.  “Japan’s production and exporters are taking direct hits
from the global economy, and that’s why it’s hard to see the
tide change,” said Isao Kubo, a Tokyo-based equity strategist
at Nissay Asset Management Corp., which oversees about 5
trillion yen. “You find it hard to be bullish on Japanese
stocks down the road.”  The Topix fell 4.2 percent in the three months through
September as China’s slowdown and Europe’s debt crisis
outweighed stimulus measures deployed by the  Bank of Japan  and
its global counterparts. Stocks in the measure are valued at
12.6 times estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.9
times for the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  and 11.9 times for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  Manufacturers’ Sentiment  Stocks fell after the Bank of Japan’s Tankan index of
sentiment among large manufacturers fell in the quarter ended
September to minus 3 from minus 1, the fourth consecutive
negative reading, the central bank said today in Tokyo.  China’s manufacturing contracted a second month for the
first time since 2009, a government survey indicated. The
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 49.8 in September after a 49.2
reading in August, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today in Beijing. A
reading below 50 signals contraction.  “People still have to downgrade their assumptions for
economic growth, and that will probably flow through the next
quarter or next half in lower profit assumptions for
companies,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion in
equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “Given markets
are closed in many parts of Asia, I think we are probably in for
a relatively quiet but soft start to the week.”  Machinery Makers  Machinery makers fell. Komatsu dropped 1 percent to 1,521
yen.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (6305) , which gets 17 percent
of its revenue out of China, fell 1.7 percent 1,241 yen.
 Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. (6302)  slid 0.8 percent to 265 yen.  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell 0.3 percent today. The index
dropped 0.5 percent in New York on Sept. 28, capping the biggest
weekly loss since June, after reports showed business activity
unexpectedly contracted in September and  consumer spending 
stalled in August as a surge in gasoline prices squeezed
paychecks.  Nippon Shokubai plunged 13 percent to 757 yen, the biggest
decline on the Topix, after a fire at its Himeji plant in
western Japan killed a firefighter and injured 33 people. All
output at the factory was halted.  Among shares that rose, Olympus gained 1.3 percent to 1,540
yen. Sony aims to partner with Olympus on a medical-devices
joint venture with a projected 200 billion yen in revenue by
2020, Chief Executive Officer  Kazuo Hirai  said today. Sony slid
0.2 percent to 917 yen.  Shares pared losses after Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda
today announced a new cabinet, including Koriki Jojima, Japan’s
fifth finance minister in three years, to deal with a stalling
recovery and strong yen.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 4 percent to
18.58, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.3 percent on
the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
