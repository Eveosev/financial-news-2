PSA  Singapore  Terminals, the
country’s container-port operator, plans to invest S$3.5 billion
($2.9 billion) to develop Phases 3 and 4 of its Pasir Panjang
terminal, it said in an e-mailed statement today.  The planned work will include building 15 new berths, an
automated container yard and unmanned, rail-mounted gantry
cranes, PSA Singapore Terminals said in the statement.  When completed by 2020, the project will boost Singapore’s
total container handling capacity to 50 million 20-foot
equivalent units a year, it said.  The port has handled 20.88 million TEUs through August,
according to the PSA Singapore Terminal  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
