NewPage Corp., the largest U.S.
coated-paper maker, settled with creditors over its plan to exit
bankruptcy by agreeing to give first-lien noteholders all of the
stock in the reorganized company.  Lower-ranking noteholders and some other unsecured
creditors will split $30 million in cash and the first
$50 million that might come from any lawsuits filed by a
litigation trust, NewPage  said  today.  “This agreement should allow us to emerge from Chapter 11
in the near term,” Chief Executive Officer George F. Martin
said in a statement.  NewPage, based in Miamisburg,  Ohio , filed for bankruptcy in
September 2011, listing $3.4 billion in assets and
$4.2 billion in debt.  The company had fought with an official committee of
unsecured creditors, arguing that since its $2.7 billion in
secured debt exceeded the value of its assets, it could pay
lower-ranking creditors nothing.  The committee began investigating whether a 2007 buyout
that expanded the company and a 2009 refinancing could be
challenged as so-called fraudulent transfers that harmed lower-
ranking creditors, according to court records.  “The committee is supportive of the plan settlement,” Luc Despins, an attorney for creditors, said in an e-mail.  NewPage may sign a $900 million credit agreement that will
allow it to exit bankruptcy, according to the statement. The
proposed credit deal would include a $500 million  term loan  and
a $400 million revolving credit agreement.  The case is In re NewPage Corp. 11-12804,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
