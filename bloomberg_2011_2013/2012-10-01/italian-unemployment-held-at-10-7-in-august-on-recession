Italy’s jobless rate remained above
10 percent in August for a seventh month as employers remain
reluctant to hire amid a deepening recession.  The unemployment rate held at a seasonally-adjusted 10.7
percent, Rome-based national statistics office Istat said in a
preliminary report today. Economists forecast an increase to
10.8 percent in August, the median of nine estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Italy’s economy contracted for a fourth straight quarter in
the three months through June as Prime Minister Mario Monti’s
policies contributed to deepening the fourth recession since
2001. The government last month revised its 2012 growth forecast
to a contraction of 2.4 percent, double its previous estimate.  The young have been particularly hard hit, with joblessness
among people aged 15 to 24 at 34.5 percent in August, Istat
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
