U.S. Gulf Coast oils weakened as
Citgo Petroleum Corp. started to halt units at the Corpus
Christi refinery in  Texas  for planned work, reducing demand.  Units are in the process of shutting in the East and West
sections of the plant, which has a combined capacity of 165,000
barrels a day, the company said in an e-mailed statement. Citgo
declined to identify the units or say how long the maintenance
will last.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
declined 90 cents to $20.25 a barrel at 2 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet
lost 75 cents to $19.25 over the U.S. benchmark.  Poseidon’s  premium  narrowed $1.30 to $13.25. Mars Blend’s
lost $1.10 to $13.65 a barrel over WTI and Southern Green Canyon
declined 50 cents to $12.25.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
narrowed 50 cents to $17.75 above WTI.  Bakken’s premium to the benchmark weakened $2.75 a barrel
to $2.  The discount for Western Canada Select, a heavy oil blend
from  Alberta , was unchanged at $11.50 a barrel below the U.S.
benchmark. Syncrude’s premium was unchanged at $9 over WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
