The Russian government plans to
reduce the so-called funded component of pensions to 2 percent
from 6 percent to avoid a  budget deficit ,  Vedomosti  reported,
citing proposals by Dmitry Medvedevâ€™s cabinet.  The move will curb investment of long-term pension money in
the Russian economy, the Moscow newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
