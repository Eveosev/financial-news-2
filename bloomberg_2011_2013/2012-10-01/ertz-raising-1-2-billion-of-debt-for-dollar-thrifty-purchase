Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) , the
second-largest U.S. car-rental company, is issuing $1.2 billion
of debt to help fund its acquisition of  Dollar Thrifty
Automotive Group Inc. (DTG)   The company, which operates in about 150 countries, may
raise as soon as today $700 million of eight-year notes to yield
about 6 percent and $500 million of 10-year securities to yield
about 6.25 percent to 6.5 percent, according to a person
familiar with the transaction who asked not to be identified
because terms aren’t set. The bonds were originally both sized
at $600 million.  Proceeds will go toward the acquisition and to refinance
existing Dollar Thrifty debt, the  Park Ridge , New Jersey-based
company said today in a statement.  Hertz last sold debt in February, issuing $250 million of
6.75 percent debentures maturing in April 2019 to yield 448
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  In August, Hertz reached a $2.6 billion deal to purchase
Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Dollar Thrifty. The company had made an
earlier bid in 2010 of about $1.2 billion that was rejected by
shareholders.  Term Loan  The new bonds will be rated B2, five levels below
investment-grade, by Moody’s Investors Service and an equivalent
B by  Standard & Poor’s , the ratings companies said in separate
statements. Enterprise Holdings Inc. is the largest U.S. car-
rental company.  Hertz set the price on a $750 million  term loan  related to
the purchase on Sept. 28, according to a person with knowledge
of that transaction.  The debt will be sold at 99 cents to 99.5 cents on the
dollar, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the terms are private. The so-called original-issue discount
reduces proceeds for the borrower and increases the yield to
investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
