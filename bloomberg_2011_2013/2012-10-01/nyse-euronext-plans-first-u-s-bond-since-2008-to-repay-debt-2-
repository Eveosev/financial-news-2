NYSE Euronext (NYX) , the biggest U.S.
exchange operator, issued $850 million of five-year securities
in its first dollar-denominated bond sale in more than four
years.  The company sold the 2 percent debt to yield 145 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  NYSE Euronext intends to use proceeds from the sale to
purchase or retire all of its $750 million of 4.8 percent
securities due in June, New York-based NYSE said today in a
regulatory filing. Funds may also be used to buy as much as 250
million euros ($323 million) of its 5.375 percent notes maturing
in 2015, the company said.  The debt may be rated A3 by Moodyâ€™s Investors Service,
according to a person familiar with the transaction, who asked
not to be identified, citing lack of authorization to speak
publicly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
