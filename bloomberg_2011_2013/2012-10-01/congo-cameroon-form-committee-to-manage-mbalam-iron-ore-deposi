The Republic of Congo and Cameroon
established a joint committee to manage mineral deposits that
straddle the border between the two Central African countries,
the Mines and Geology Ministry said.  “The two parties agreed to collaborate and work together to
remove all obstacles that may delay or compromise the
achievement of this project,” according to a statement handed to
reporters in the Congolese capital, Brazzaville, on Sept. 27.
The statement was signed by Congo Mines Minister Pierre Oba and
Louis-Paul Motaze, general secretary in the Cameroonian prime
minister’s office.  Sundance Resources Ltd. (SDL)  of  Australia  owns the  Mbalam  iron-
ore project that plans to produce 35 million metric tons of the
metal annually. It also plans to build a 510-kilometer (317-
mile) railway linking the Mbarga mine in Cameroon and the Nabeba
mine in Congo to the coast of Cameroon, as well as a deep-water
iron-ore export terminal, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
