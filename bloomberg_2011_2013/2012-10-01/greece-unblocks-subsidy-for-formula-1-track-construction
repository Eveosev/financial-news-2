Greece  unblocked a subsidy of 28.9
million euros ($37.2 million) for the construction of an
international-standard racetrack that can be used for staging
 Formula One  car racing, the  Ministry of Development  said.  The track, which will be designed to host other events as
well, including world championship motorbike racing and go-kart
racing, will be built in Xalandritsa near the western port city
of Patras at a total cost of 94.6 million euros, the Athens-
based ministry said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.
Racetrack Patras SA, a private  investment company , will oversee
the project.  Greek Deputy Development Minister Notis Mitarakis also
signed documents to unblock other subsidies worth a total of
44.4 million euros for a project to build a glass pane-making
factory in northern Greece and for modernizing and expanding
facilities at the luxury  Elounda Bay palace hotel  in Crete,
including the building of a new conference center, according to
the statement.  The three projects are the first of seven, each worth more
than 50 million euros, that were delayed amid funding
difficulties and two general elections. The three projects are
collectively expected to generate over 800 new jobs, the
ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
