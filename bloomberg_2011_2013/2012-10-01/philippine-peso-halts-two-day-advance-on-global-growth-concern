The Philippine peso dropped, snapping
a two-day advance, as signs the global economic slowdown is
worsening deterred investors from buying emerging-market assets.
 Government bonds  were steady.  The peso pared its gain to 4.9 percent this year after
China’s manufacturing contracted for a second month and big
Japanese manufacturers became more pessimistic, reports showed
today. The Philippine Stock Exchange  Composite Index (PCOMP)  fell 0.7
percent.  “Global growth concerns will have a dampening effect on
the appetite for Philippine assets,” said Joey Cuyegkeng, an
economist at ING Groep NV in Manila. “The peso has been one of
the strongest currencies in the region this year.”  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 41.770 per dollar in
Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency touched
41.358 on Sept. 17, the strongest level since April 2008. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, was unchanged at 5.5 percent.  China’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 49.8 in September
after a 49.2 reading in August, official data showed. That
compares with the median forecast of 50.1 in a Bloomberg News
survey.  The Tankan index for large manufacturers fell in the July
to September quarter to minus 3 from minus 1, the fourth
negative reading, the  Bank of Japan (8301)  said in Tokyo. The median
estimate of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for
minus 4. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists.  The yield on the government’s 4.75 percent bonds due Sept.
2022 was unchanged at 4.7 percent, according to prices from
Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
