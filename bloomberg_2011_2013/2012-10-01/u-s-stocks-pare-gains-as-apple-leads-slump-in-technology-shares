U.S. stocks pared gains as  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
led a retreat in technology shares that wiped out most of an
early rally triggered by unexpected growth in American
manufacturing.  Apple slid 1.2 percent, extending last week’s 4.7 percent
tumble. Technology shares in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
lost 0.4 percent and were the biggest drag on the index among
its 10 main groups.  The S&P 500 was up less than 0.1 percent at 1,441.39 at
3:27 p.m. in New York after surging as much as 1.1 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
