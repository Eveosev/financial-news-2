The pound dropped the most in two
weeks against the euro after an index of U.K. manufacturing
declined more in September than economists forecast.  Sterling weakened versus all except two of its 16 major
peers after the  Bank of England  said net lending for homes
dropped the most in almost three years. Sterling also weakened
against the euro after stress-test results bolstered confidence
in  Spain ’s banking system and spurred demand for the single
currency. Gilts fell as  Fitch Ratings  said U.K. government debt
will peak at a higher level than earlier estimated.  “With little else to focus on today, domestic
considerations may come back to the forefront” and that may
weigh on the pound, said Audrey Childe-Freeman, head foreign-
exchange strategist at  Bank of Montreal  in  London .  The U.K. currency declined 0.5 percent to 79.93 pence per
euro at 4:13 p.m. London time after sliding as much as 0.6
percent, the biggest drop since Sept. 14. The pound depreciated
less than 0.1 percent to $1.6155.  The pound is poised to advance to $1.65 in the next three
months, Childe-Freeman said.  A gauge of U.K. manufacturing, based on a survey by  Markit
Economics  and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply ,
fell to 48.4 last month from a revised 49.6 in August. Banks
granted 47,665 mortgages, compared with a revised 47,556 the
prior month, the Bank of England said. Net mortgage lending slid
by 276 million pounds, the biggest drop since December 2010.  Stress Tests  The pound weakened for a second day versus the euro after
stress tests commissioned by Spain and released Sept. 28 showed
the nation’s banks have a capital deficit of 59.3 billion euros,
less than the 62 billion euros estimated in June.  Sterling appreciated to 79.24 pence per euro on Sept. 27,
the strongest level since Sept. 6.  The pound has still gained 1.6 percent this year, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro fell 3.1 percent and the
dollar weakened 2.7 percent.  Britain’s efforts to cut the  budget deficit  are “standing
still” and the pound may come under pressure if investors lose
confidence in the fiscal plans and the economic recovery, Fitch
Ratings Managing Director David Riley told  Maryam Nemazee  on
Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” in London.  “It’s a very serious situation that the U.K. finds itself
in,” Riley said. “The budget deficit for this year is going to
be in excess of 8 percent, which, actually despite all of the
talk of austerity, actually means the U.K. is now standing still
in terms of  deficit reduction .”  Gilts Drop  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.75 percent. The 1.75 percent bond
due in September 2022 fell 0.18, or 1.80 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 100.025.  The U.K. is scheduled to auction as much as 3.5 billion
pounds of the securities tomorrow.  Overseas investors boosted holdings of U.K. government
bonds for a second month in August, the Bank of England said.
Non-residents bought 5.6 billion pounds more gilts than they
sold, after raising holdings by 9.36 billion pounds in July,
data published today showed.  Gilts returned 3.2 percent this year through Sept. 28,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
3.3 percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
