Coral cover along  Australia ’s Great
Barrier Reef has shrunk by half since 1985 as storms, warmer
seas and starfish colonies kill off organisms, scientists said.  Coral covers almost 14 percent of the 2,000-kilometer
(1,200-mile) reef system, down from 28 percent in 1985,
researchers said in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences . Forty-eight percent of the decline is a result of
storms, 42 percent is down to predatory starfish and 10 percent
to so-called bleaching caused by warmer waters, they said today.  “Coral cover could halve again by 2022,” Peter Doherty, a
researcher at the  Australian Institute of Marine Science  in
Townsville, Queensland, who helped create the monitoring
program, said in an e-mailed statement.  The decline threatens the world’s largest coral reef
ecosystem, which hosts thousands of species of fish. The Global
Coral Reef Monitoring Network said in 2008 that a fifth of the
world’s corals had already died and that many more would be lost
by 2050 as carbon-dioxide emissions make waters more acidic and
push global temperatures higher.  “This loss of over half of initial cover is of great
concern, signifying habitat loss for the tens of thousands of
species associated with tropical coral reefs,” the researchers
wrote. “The rate of decline has also increased substantially
and has averaged about 1.45 percent per year since about 2006.”  While scientists can’t stop storms, the reefs could be
protected by improving water quality to stem the spread of the
crown-of-thorns starfish, they said. Nutrient-rich agricultural
run-off helps the starfish’s larvae survive.  Without the starfish, coral cover would expand by 0.89
percent a year, as opposed to the 0.53 percent shrinkage it’s
averaged since 1985, the researchers said.  Today’s paper was based on 2,258 surveys of 214 reefs
conducted from 1985 through 2012. Researchers have spent more
than 2,700 days at sea, and the monitoring program has cost $50
million to date, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
