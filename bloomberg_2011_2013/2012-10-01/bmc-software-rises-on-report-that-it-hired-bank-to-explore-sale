BMC Software Inc. (BMC) , a maker of
software to manage corporate-computer networks, rose after the
Wall Street Journal reported that it hired  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
to explore a possible sale.  The shares climbed 3.3 percent to $42.85 at the close in
New York.  BMC Software, based in Houston, has faced pressure to
consider a sale from activist investor Elliott Associates LP,
which had a 7.7 percent stake in August, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg. The software maker has added two
directors chosen by Elliott after earlier refusing to consider a
sale and rebuffing his push for the appointment of five board
members.  BMC has said that Morgan Stanley is working as its adviser.
The New York-based continues to provide financial advice to the
company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  Mark Stouse, a spokesman for BMC, declined to comment, as
did Melissa Kitlowski, a spokeswoman for  Charlotte , North
Carolina-based Bank of America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
