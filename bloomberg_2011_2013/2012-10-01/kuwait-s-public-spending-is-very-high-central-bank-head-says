Kuwait’s public spending is still too
high, according to Central Bank Governor Mohammad Al-Hashel,
after a series of strikes prompted the government to raise wages
in the public sector.  “We think it’s very high, and we’re taking all the
necessary actions to reduce the current expenditure and spend
more on investments and  capital expenditures ,” Al-Hashel told
reporters in Kuwait today.  Former central bank Governor Sheikh Salem AbdulAziz Al-
Sabah resigned in February, criticizing the government’s
increase of public spending “to unprecedented levels.” The
 International Monetary Fund  said in May that Kuwait will exhaust
all oil revenue by 2017 if the policy continues.  A series of public strikes late last year led to increases
to wages, including a 25 percent raise in March. Current
expenditure by OPEC’s third-biggest oil producer accounted for
more than 60 percent of total public spending in the 2011-2012
fiscal year.  The nation’s economy may grow between 5 percent and 6
percent this year, Al-Hashel said, short of the IMF’s forecast
of 6.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
