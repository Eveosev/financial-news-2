Lithuania plans to borrow about 7.5
billion litai ($2.8 billion) next year mostly to repay debt, a
Finance Ministry spokesman said.  The Vilnius-based ministry plans to raise about half the
total through domestic borrowing and will decide in what
currency to sell foreign debt “based on the situation in the
markets,” spokesman Vytautas Lenkutis said in an e-mail.  The Baltic nation is tapping international markets as it
prepares to refinance a 1 billion-euro ($1.29 billion) bond that
matures in March. Lithuania sold 175 million Swiss francs ($187
million) of 2017 bonds with a coupon of 2 percent on Sept. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
