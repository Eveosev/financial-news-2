Greece’s economy will contract for a
sixth year in 2013 as the government prepares further cuts to
pensions, wages and social benefits to meet the terms of its
bailout packages.  Gross domestic product will shrink 3.8 percent next year
after contracting 6.5 percent in 2012, according to the 2013
draft budget, e-mailed by the Finance Ministry in  Athens  and
submitted to parliament today. This compares with a prediction
in Greece’s March rescue agreement with the European Union and
the International Monetary Fund that the economy would contract
4.8 percent this year before stabilizing in 2013.  The budget follows months of haggling between Prime
Minister Antonis Samaras and the leaders of the two parties
supporting his coalition government over 13.5 billion euros
($17.4 billion) of austerity measures for the next two years.
The measures will help reduce the deficit to 4.2 percent of GDP
in 2013 from 6.6 percent this year, the draft budget shows.  Agreement with the so-called troika of officials from the
European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank on
the measures -- comprising an extra 3 billion euros in revenue
with spending cuts amounting to 10.5 billion euros -- is
imperative to allow the release of 31 billion euros under the
country’s bailouts. That payment is designed primarily to
recapitalize the nation’s banks in a bid to boost liquidity in a
cash-starved economy.  Primary Surplus  Without the additional measures the shortfall would have
bounced back to 7.1 percent of GDP, the document today showed.
 Greece  will show a primary surplus next year of 1.1 percent of
GDP or 2.2 billion euros, from a deficit this year of 2.8
billion euros.  The latest measures, worth 7.8 billion euros, include
raising the retirement age to 67 from 65, cuts to wages and
pensions and benefits, as well as to health, defense and
education spending.  The general government deficit for next year will narrow to
8 billion euros from 13.2 billion euros this year, according to
the draft budget. General government debt will reach 179.3
percent of GDP next year, or 346 billion euros, from 169.5
percent this year, or 340.6 billion euros, the budget forecast.  More Time  The central government deficit, which excludes outlays by
state-owned institutions and companies, will be 11.6 billion
euros next year, down from 15.4 billion euros in 2012, the
forecasts indicate. Ordinary government revenue is forecast at
51.8 billion euros in 2013 from 53.7 billion euros this year
while ordinary government spending next year will be 56.6
billion euros.  Greece’s coalition government has requested more time to
spread out the budget measures to 2016, which would require
additional funding and the approval of the EU and the IMF. The
IMF has indicated that any additional financing will have to
come from  Europe , where officials have told Samaras no
discussion can be held on an extension until he honors pledges
made for the country’s rescue package.  Unemployment will average 24.7 percent in 2013, up from
23.5 percent this year, and EU-harmonized inflation will average
0.7 percent next year, compared with 1.2 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
