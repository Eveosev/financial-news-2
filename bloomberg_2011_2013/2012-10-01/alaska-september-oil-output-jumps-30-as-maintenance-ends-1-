Alaska North Slope oil production
rose 30 percent in September from the previous month as fields
operated by  BP Plc (BP/)  and  ConocoPhillips (COP)  resumed production after
annual maintenance ended.  Production averaged 516,296 barrels a day  in September , up
from 398,643  in August , the state’s tax division said on its
website.  Production from Prudhoe Bay fields operated by BP rose to
271,444 barrels a day from 177,182 in August, when two fields,
Milne Point and Northstar, and three Prudhoe Bay facilities were
shut for maintenance during part of the month, said Dawn Patience, a BP spokeswoman in Anchorage.  “Operations are back to normal, and our maintenance
season, which typically takes place in the summer because
otherwise we are in arctic conditions, has wrapped up,”
Patience said.  Production from ConocoPhillips’s Alpine field rose to
73,997 barrels a day from 55,369 barrels a day in August, when
it was in maintenance during the first 10 days of the month,
said Natalie Lowman, a spokeswoman in Anchorage.  September production was down 15 percent from the North
Slope’s year-earlier average of 608,680 barrels a day.  Alaska North Slope crude  was priced at $110.48 a barrel
today, $18 above the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
