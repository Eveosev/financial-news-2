More than 80 percent of Icelanders
support the countryâ€™s efforts to separate investment and
commercial banking, according to a Capacent Gallup poll
commissioned by Straumur Investment Bank hf.  Only 4.2 percent of those polled opposed forcing banking
groups to split their businesses, while 15.6 percent of voters
neither supported the move nor opposed it, according to the poll
received today via e-mail.  Capacent Gallup polled 1,375 people from Sept. 20 through
Sept. 27. Of those polled, 60.1 percent answered. The margin of
error was 0.1 percent, according to the poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
