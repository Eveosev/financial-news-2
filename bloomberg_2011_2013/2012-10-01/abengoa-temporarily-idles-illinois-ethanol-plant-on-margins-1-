Abengoa SA (ABG) , a Spanish engineering and
renewable energy company, will temporarily idle a Madison,
 Illinois , ethanol plant for maintenance and because of poor
production margins.  The plant has the capacity to produce 88 million gallons of
ethanol annually, Christopher Standlee, a spokesman for the
company, said in a telephone interview today. Seville-based
Abengoa doesn’t know how long it will be idle, he said.  Standlee said the company decided to idle the plant during
routine work after the worst U.S. drought in 56 years scorched
cornfields and raised the cost of producing the biofuel.  Denatured ethanol for October delivery slipped 0.4 cent to
$2.34 a gallon at 1:03 p.m. local time on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. Futures have gained 6.2 percent this year.  Corn for December delivery rose 1.75 cents to $7.58 a
bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, plants
are losing about 41 cents on each gallon of the biofuel
produced, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. That doesn’t include
profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  Biofuel Energy Corp. (BIOF) , a U.S. ethanol producer partially
owned by venture capitalists David Einhorn and Daniel Loeb, shut
its 115 million-gallon-a-year plant in Fairmont,  Minnesota ,
because of poor profit margins Sept. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
