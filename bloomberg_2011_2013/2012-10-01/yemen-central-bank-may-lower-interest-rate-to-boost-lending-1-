Yemen may lower its benchmark
interest rate of about 20 percent to boost lending in the Arab
nation, which ousted its President last year, central bank
Governor Mohamed Awad Bin Humam says.  “We will go about it progressively,” Bin Humam said in
Kuwait City today. “Maybe it should be reduced to stimulate
lending.”  The nation, which received $500 million from Qatar to fund
development, still needs $3 billion in foreign aid to fund
projects over the next three years, in addition to the $6.4
billion in pledges it got in  Riyadh  in September, Bin Humam
said. The U.S. has more than doubled its aid to Yemen this year
to $345 million, said Rajiv Shah, administrator of the U.S.
Agency for International Development.  Yemen’s economy shrank 10.5 percent last year, according to
the International Monetary Fund, more than anywhere in the world
bar Libya, where a civil war halted oil output. Crude production
in Yemen also slowed, with repeated attacks on the Marib oil
pipeline, and the country suffered regular power shortages as
its budget plunged into deficit. Yemen’s consumer price index
declined 3.5 percent this year, Bin Humam said.  The nation, which raised 50 billion riyals ($233 million)
from the sale of sukuk in April, has no plans to issue more
Islamic bonds, Bin Humam said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
