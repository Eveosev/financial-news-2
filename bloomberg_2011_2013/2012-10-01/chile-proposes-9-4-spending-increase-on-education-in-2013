Chileâ€™s government has proposed a
9.4 percent increase in real terms in education spending in its
2013 budget legislation, President Sebastian Pinera said today
in a televised address to the nation.  Outlays on education would increase by $1.2 billion to
$12.8 billion, allowing the government to reduce interest rates
on  student loans  and increase the number of scholarships, he
said.  Pinera said on Sept. 10 the budget would propose a total
spending increase of about 5 percent over 2012. Congress has
until the end of November to vote on the budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
