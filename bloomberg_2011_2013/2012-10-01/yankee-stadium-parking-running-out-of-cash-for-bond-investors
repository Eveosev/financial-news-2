Parking garages serving  New York 
Yankees baseball fans won’t have sufficient reserves next year
to pay investors holding about $240 million of tax-exempt debt,
according to a security filing.  Principal and interest payments to bondholders next year
total $15 million, almost double the cash currently available
to repay investors, according to offering documents and a
notice filed with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.  After making a payment to bondholders today, Bronx Parking
Development Co., a nonprofit that operates the facilities under
a lease with  New York City , has about $422,000 of debt-service
reserves remaining and an $8.1 million surplus fund, according
to the filing. The corporation said in June the securities must
be restructured, with investors taking losses, or it may pursue
bankruptcy protection. Bonds due in 2017 traded as low as 45
cents on the dollar Aug. 21, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We are having many discussion with bondholders,”
including the option to file for bankruptcy, Steven Polivy, an
attorney representing Bronx Parking, said in a telephone
interview.  Bronx parking has been hurt by Major League Baseball fans
taking public transportation to games and falling attendance at
Yankee Stadium. The combined average occupancy at the parking
facilities is 43 percent, according to a Sept. 11 filing.
When the debt was issued in 2007, the nonprofit projected an 88
percent occupancy rate.  It costs $25 to $48 to park during a Yankees game, 
according to the operator's website and a securities filing.  Five Garages  Edward Moran, a financial adviser for Bronx Parking,
declined to comment on any potential bankruptcy filing or how
the corporation plans to pay investors in 2013. The next payment
is due April 1.  Bronx Parking issued $237.6 million of municipal bonds in
2007 through New York City’s Industrial Development Agency to
build three garages, renovate two others and refurbish six lots
near the 50,287-seat Yankee Stadium. The facility opened in 2009
adjacent to the site of the team’s old ballpark.  Nuveen Asset Management owned $131.1 million of the
parking-garage debt as of Aug. 31, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Kristyna Munoz, a spokeswoman for Nuveen, declined to
comment.  Average attendance for Yankees home games is 43,691 this
year, down from 45,107 last year, according to the ESPN website.
The team has won 92 games and lost 67 and is tied for first
place with the  Baltimore Orioles  in the  American League East .  To contact the reporter on this story:
