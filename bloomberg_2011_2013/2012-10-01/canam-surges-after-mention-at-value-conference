Canam Group Inc. (CAM) , a manufacturer of
construction materials including steel, rose the most in almost
four years after an investment manager called the stock
undervalued and recommended it at a conference in  New York .  Canam climbed 12 percent to close at C$5.67 in Toronto, its
biggest one-day gain since Oct. 20, 2008. The Saint-Georges,
Quebec-based company has increased 38 percent this year.  Guy Gottfried , manager of Toronto-based Rational Investment
Group LP, a value-oriented investment fund, made the comments at
the Value Investing Congress.  Canam “made some very good acquisitions in the downturn,”
Frederic Bastien, an analyst with  Raymond James Financial Inc. (RJF) 
said by telephone from  Vancouver .  The company had been trading at 0.7 times book value, which
didn’t reflect its strong position in the U.S. and Canadian
commercial markets, particularly after its 2010 purchase of U.S.
steel fabricator FabSouth LLC, Bastien said. Bastien has the
equivalent of a buy rating on the stock.  “It should grow at an above-industry average,” he said.
“It will continue to win market share in its markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
