Barloworld Ltd. (BAW) , Africa’s largest
forklift dealer, forecast global industry sales of new mining
equipment will drop 25 percent in 2013 after reaching a record
in the fiscal year that’s just ended.  “New equipment sales are cyclical, whereas the sale of new
parts and servicing are more static,” Chief Executive Officer
Clive Thomson said in an interview in Johannesburg last week.
“We expect growth in servicing and sales of new parts.”  Expectations for lower unit sales follow a smaller order
book in the year ended Sept. 30, Thomson said. Companies selling
mining gear saw record sales in 2012 and he said he expects new
equipment sales to still be ahead of 2011 results, without
giving any specific forecasts.  While sales to South African mines contribute about 18
percent to the company’s profit, Barloworld isn’t directly
affected by the strikes disrupting mines in the country. That’s
because most of its customers have open-cast operations, rather
than underground platinum or gold mines, Thomson said.  About 39 percent of the country’s gold production was
halted last week as strikes in the industry spread. Gold
workers, encouraged by a 22 percent pay increase that ended an
unofficial strike at  Lonmin Plc (LMI) , have joined coal miners in
walkouts.  Barloworld, which has  Caterpillar (CAT)  Inc. dealerships in
 Russia ,  Spain , Portugal and 12 sub-equatorial African countries,
expects revenue to rise to “around 60 billion rand” ($7.2
billion) for the year through September, compared with  49.8
billion rand  last year, Thomson said.  Barloworld, which has sold Caterpillar equipment since
1927, bought Bucyrus International Inc.’s distribution and
support units in  South Africa  and Botswana from Peoria,
Illinois-based Caterpillar for $175 million in July. The company
wants to expand in underground mining, Thomson said. It expects
the two units to add $335 million to $385 million to 2013
revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
