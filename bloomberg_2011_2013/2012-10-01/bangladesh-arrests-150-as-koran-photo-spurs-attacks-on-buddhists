Police in  Bangladesh  arrested 150
people for involvement in attacks by Muslims on Buddhist temples
and homes following the posting on Facebook of a photograph of a
burned Koran.  “The situation is now under control,” Selim Jahangir,
superintendent of police for Cox’s Bazar, a district in the
southeast of Bangladesh near the country’s border with Myanmar,
said in a phone interview today. The army was deployed to help
restore security, Jahangir said.  Rioters blamed a local  Buddhist  boy for the photograph, the
Associated Press reported yesterday. The image was later removed
from Facebook, the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory
Commission said in a statement.  Muslim mobs attacked 12 temples and 50 homes in the
predominantly Buddhist area of Ramu, about 10 kilometers (6
miles) from Cox’s Bazar city, according to The Daily Star
newspaper. Buddhist and Hindu places of worship were also
targeted in other parts of the district during two days of
violence that ended yesterday, the paper said.  “The attacks were a premeditated and deliberate act of
communal violence against a minority,” Home Minister Mohiuddin
Khan Alamgir told reporters in Dhaka yesterday, vowing to bring
those responsible to justice.  Bangladeshi Muslims staged protests last month over a U.S.
made amateur movie that ridiculed Prophet Muhammad, mirroring
demonstrations in other parts of South Asia, including India and
 Pakistan . Bangladesh barred access to  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube
website in a bid to ease tensions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
