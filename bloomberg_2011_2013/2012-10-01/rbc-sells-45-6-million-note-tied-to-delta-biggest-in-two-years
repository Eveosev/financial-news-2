Royal Bank of Canada  sold $45.6
million of one-year notes tied to the share price of  Delta Air
Lines Inc. (DAL) , the largest U.S. offering linked to the company
since at least January 2010.  The securities, issued Sept. 27, pay 14 percent annual
interest and an additional 1.9 percent if the stock rises at
least 14 percent, with investors at risk of losing as much as 95
percent of their investment, according to a  prospectus  filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Bank of
America Corp . distributed the securities for a 1.75 percent
commission.  Deutsche Bank AG sold the second-largest note tied to the
world’s second-biggest carrier this year on April 20. The $4.24
million of one-year, auto-callable securities yield 13.5 percent
a year as long as the stock doesn’t decline by more than 55
percent, according to a  prospectus  filed with the SEC.  Shares of Delta have  dropped  about 22 percent to $9.45 from
their more than one-year peak on May 31. The airline has been
trying to buy cheaper domestic Bakken crude oil from  North
Dakota  to save money on making jet fuel.  Bloomberg began collecting comprehensive data on U.S. SEC-
