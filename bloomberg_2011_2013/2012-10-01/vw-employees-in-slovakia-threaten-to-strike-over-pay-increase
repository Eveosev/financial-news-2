Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe ’s biggest
carmaker, is offering employees at its Bratislava plant half the
pay increase that unions are demanding and may face a halt to
production because of a threatened strike.  The factory, opened in 1991, is involved in production of
models including the VW Touareg, Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne
sport-utility vehicles and hasn’t suffered a strike yet. VW
produced 210,400 cars at the plant in 2011. In the first half of
this year it made 209,400, a jump of 122 percent from a year
earlier.  Volkswagen is offering a pay increase of 3.2 percent
starting in January 2013 and two single payments of 100 euros
($129) each, it said in an e-mail. The unions are asking for a
6.8 percent increase, the company said.  “We are confident that we will reach a deal this year from
which all our staff will profit,” Boris Michalik, head of labor
relations at Volkswagen Slovakia said in an e-mailed statement.  Vladimir Machalik, a VW Slovakia spokesman, confirmed that
the head of the works council said that he is ready to negotiate
and is also making preparations for a strike, as reported
earlier today by Slovak news agency TASR.  “In the short term a strike shouldn’t be a big deal for VW
as the company is anyway adapting its production to lower
demand, but of course it will depend on length of the strike,”
Michael Punzet, an analyst at  DZ Bank  in  Frankfurt , said via
phone.  The Bratislava plant also produces the VW Up!, Seat Mii and
Skoda Citigo subcompacts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
