The ruble climbed to the highest in
almost a week against the dollar as crude oil, Russia’s main
export earner, advanced amid optimism  Europe ’s debt crisis can
be contained.  The ruble strengthened 0.5 percent to 31.0450 per dollar by
7 p.m. in Moscow, rebounding from an earlier decline of as much
as 0.4 percent. The Russian currency gained 0.2 percent against
the euro to 40.0500 and was up 0.3 percent versus the central
bank’s euro-dollar basket.  Crude oil rose 0.5 percent to $92.63 per barrel in  New
York . Oil and gas account for about 50 percent of Russia’s state
revenue. Spanish bank stress tests showed a capital deficit of
59.3 billion euros ($76 billion), less than the 100 billion
euros agreed as part of a bailout.  “The fact that it is up again is more about the oil price
rising,” Maria Pomelnikova, an analyst at ZAO Raiffeisenbank in
Moscow, said by e-mail today. “The currency’s future movements
will depend primarily on the backdrop overseas.”  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.5257 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.7088 on Sept. 28.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell four basis points to 204,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields compiled by the Micex rose
two basis points to 7.513 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
