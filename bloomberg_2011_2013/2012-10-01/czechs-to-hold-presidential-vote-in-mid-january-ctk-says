The Czech Republic will vote in
presidential elections on Jan. 11 and Jan. 12 to replace Vaclav Klaus as the head of the state, the  CTK  newswire reported,
citing Senate Chairman Milan Stech.  The country may hold a second round of its first direct
presidential elections on Jan. 25 and Jan. 26 if no candidate
gets a majority of votes in the opening round, the newswire
said. Until now, Czech presidents were elected by the lower and
upper houses of parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
