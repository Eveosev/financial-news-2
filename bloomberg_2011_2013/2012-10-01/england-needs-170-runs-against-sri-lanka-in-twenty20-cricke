Sri Lanka  totalled 169-6 against
England in its World Twenty20 cricket match at home in
Pallekele.  England will be eliminated from the tournament unless it
beats Sri Lanka, which will go through with West Indies with a
victory. West Indies defeated New Zealand in a “Super Over” in
the day’s earlier match after each reached 139 runs in their
innings.  Mahela Jayawardene was caught off Graeme Swann on 42, and
Jeevan Mendis and  Angelo Mathews  combined for 52 off 31 balls to
push Sri Lanka on.  Stuart Broad  was 3-32 and Swann was 2-26.  The World Twenty20, generally held every two years, is the
championship of the game’s shortest form. The Super Eight
consists of two groups of four, with the top two teams in each
advancing to the semifinals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
