Mexico ’s peso advanced after a report
showed U.S. manufacturing in better shape than analysts
forecast, boosting the economic outlook for the Latin American
country’s chief trading partner.  The peso appreciated 0.4 percent to 12.8138 per dollar at
1:07 p.m. in Mexico City, extending its rally this year to 8.8
percent, the biggest gain among the greenback’s 16 most-traded
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  Manufacturing in the U.S. unexpectedly expanded in
September, as the  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. factory
index rose to 51.5 from 49.6 a month earlier, indicating the
industry is stabilizing after three months of contraction.
Mexico, which relies on exports for about 30 percent of its
gross domestic product, sends 80 percent of them to the U.S.  “The peso has been on a tear as of late,” Aryam Vazquez,
an economist for global  emerging markets  at  Wells Fargo & Co .,
said by phone from Harrington Park,  New Jersey . “Anytime you
have strong ISM manufacturing prints here in the U.S. it bodes
well for Mexico given the synergies.”  Mexico’s lower house of Congress approved legislation
easing the process of hiring and firing workers over the
weekend. Supporters say the bill would foster  job creation  by
luring businesses out of the informal sector and spur faster
economic growth in Latin America’s second-biggest economy. The
Senate is expected to vote on the measure this month.  Economists covering Mexico expect the economy to expand
3.85 percent in 2012, after growing 3.9 percent last year,
according to the monthly central bank survey published today.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 rose one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 5.41 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price dropped 0.09 centavo to 140.92
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
