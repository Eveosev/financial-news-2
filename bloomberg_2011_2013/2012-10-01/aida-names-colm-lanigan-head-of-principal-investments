Abu Dhabi  Investment Authority, among
the world’s biggest sovereign wealth funds, named Colm Lanigan
head of Principal Investments in its private equity unit.  Lanigan, who formerly worked at  Credit Suisse First Boston (CSGN) 
and his own private equity firm, starts immediately and reports
to Hareb Al Darmaki, executive director of the fund’s private
equity department, ADIA said today in an e-mailed statement.  Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates and home to
about 6 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves, is trying to
diversify away from oil by investing globally. ADIA invests
across more than 24 asset classes, including equities, fixed
income and private equity, where it takes minority stakes.  Lanigan will work on developing strategy and managing
principal investments in which ADIA acquires equity stakes,
according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
