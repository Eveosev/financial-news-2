AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  suspended share
buybacks as the board and new Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot review strategy at the U.K. drugmaker, prompting renewed
speculation that the company will embark on larger takeovers.  AstraZeneca has repurchased $2.3 billion of stock this
year, compared with an initial target of $4.5 billion, the
London-based company said in a statement today. The company
confirmed its forecast for profit excluding some items this year
of $6 to $6.30 a share.  The decision to stop repurchasing shares gives the
drugmaker more flexibility to undertake a big  acquisition , said
Brian Bourdot, an analyst at Barclays Plc’s investment-banking
unit in  London . Under Soriot’s predecessor,  David Brennan ,
AstraZeneca stuck to smaller purchases and licensing agreements
to replenish sales as its best-selling drugs lose patent
protection and face generic competitors.  “It’s a bit of a surprise that they changed course mid-
year, but a new chief executive likes to take control and see
what the options are,” Bourdot said in a telephone interview.
“It would increase their ability to do a deal, that’s something
we have to bear in mind.”  Strategy Review  AstraZeneca, the U.K.’s second-largest pharmaceutical
company after GlaxoSmithKline Plc, fell 1 percent to close at
2,925 pence in London trading.  AstraZeneca is undergoing its annual strategy review, and
has said it plans to announce the results in January, when it
reports 2012 earnings. The company also will provide a forecast
for 2013 at that time, according to today’s statement.  “As I assume my new responsibilities at AstraZeneca, I
believe this is a prudent step that maintains flexibility while
the board and I complete the company’s ongoing annual strategy
update,” Soriot said in the statement.  Soriot, 53, takes over today at AstraZeneca. Brennan
stepped down June 1 after setbacks in drug research.  Dividends, Buybacks  Under Brennan, AstraZeneca focused on paying dividends and
buying back shares to provide a return for investors while the
company waited for experimental drugs to make it to the market
and boost earnings. Brennan told investors not to judge the
company by its earnings as it went through patent expirations on
some the company’s key drugs.  Brennan said repeatedly the company wouldn’t do any deals
on the scale of AstraZeneca’s purchase of MedImmune Inc. in 2007
for about $15.2 billion. Analysts criticized the company for
overpaying for MedImmune. Since then, the company has done only
one acquisition of greater than $1 billion, the purchase of
Ardea Biosciences Inc. for $1.1 billion this year.  Repeated failures in  drug development  undermined that
approach, and Brennan retired this year. AstraZeneca pays an
annual dividend equal to 6.2 percent of the share price, the
highest yield among the world’s 10 biggest drug companies. Last
year the company paid out $3.68 billion in dividends, according
to  data compiled by Bloomberg .  MedImmune's Lesson  “I don’t think they will do a deal unless it adds value,”
Bourdot said. Management “learned its lesson” from MedImmune,
he said. Barclays has an equalweight rating on the shares.  Drugs including Seroquel and Nexium that account for 44
percent of AstraZeneca’s sales lose patent protection from this
year through the end of 2014.  Buybacks won’t help revenue grow, Navid Malik, an analyst
with  Cenkos Securities Plc (CNKS) , said in an interview. AstraZeneca
probably will consider acquiring a biotechnology company or
products, he said.  “I think there is a big change in strategy coming for
AstraZeneca,” he said. “It really needs to go down the
biologics route and he comes from a deep biologics background.
They can’t do it organically, it would take too long.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
