Morgan Stanley (MS)  Mortgage Capital
Holdings LLC was sued for at least $110.8 million by a trustee
for investors in mortgage-backed securities.  The Morgan Stanley unit made “numerous and repeated
failures” to comply with promises about the loans underlying
the securities, trustee U.S. Bancorp said in a Sept. 28 filing
in New York State Supreme Court.  The original principal balance of loans sold as securities
was $609 million, and the amount of defective loans is more than
$129 million, according to the filing. U.S. Bancorp said it is
seeking at least $110.8 million in damages.  Lauren Onis, a spokeswoman for New York-based Morgan
Stanley, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment
on the suit.  The case is Morgan Stanley Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-13ARX
v. Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC, 653429-2012, 
 New York  State Supreme Court, New York County ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
