Google Inc. (GOOG)  is close to buying
facial-recognition software maker  Viewdle  for about $45 million,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  Viewdle’s 36 employees, mostly based in the Ukraine, will
join Google, said the people, who asked not to be named because
the deal has yet to be made public. Google will announce the
acquisition as early as tomorrow, they said.  Founded in 2007, Viewdle is backed by Best Buy Co.,
Research In Motion Ltd.’s BlackBerry Partners Fund and Qualcomm
Inc.’s venture arm. The company’s software allows smartphone
manufacturers to embed facial-recognition technology into their
handsets.  Katelin Todhunter-Gerberg, a spokeswoman for Mountain View,
California-based Google, declined to comment. Google’s
acquisition of Viewdle was reported earlier by Forbes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
