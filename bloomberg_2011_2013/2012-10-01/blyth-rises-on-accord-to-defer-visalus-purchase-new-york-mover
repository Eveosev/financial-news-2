Blyth Inc. (BTH)  climbed as much as 24
percent in extended trading after the maker of candles and
decorations said it reached an agreement to defer the final
closing of its purchase of its ViSalus unit until April 2014.  The shares rose 6.5 percent to $28.50 at 6:03 p.m., after
advancing as high as $33.25 at 4:06 p.m. The stock had gained
3 percent to $26.77 at the close in  New York .  Blyth, based in Greenwich,  Connecticut , said in a statement
today that the agreement in principle is with ViSalus founders
Ryan Blair, Blake Mallen and Nick Sarnicola. A definitive accord
still must be reached, the company said.  Blyth has been required to buy the remaining 27 percent of
ViSalus, a health-care company acquired in 2008, next year for
about $271 million if the unit meets certain performance goals.
Moody’s Investors Service last month cut its outlook for Blyth
to “negative,” citing a weaker core business and possible
liquidity restraints in 2013 from the potential ViSalus purchase
obligation and $100 million of notes that are maturing.  The company last month withdrew an initial public offering
for the unit, citing uncertain market conditions for ViSalus.
The IPO would have eliminated the requirement that Blyth buy the
remaining stake in ViSalus, the company has said.  Chief Financial Officer Robert Barghaus didn’t immediately
return telephone calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
