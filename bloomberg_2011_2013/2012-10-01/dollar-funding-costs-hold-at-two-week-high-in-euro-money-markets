The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars rose to the highest level in more than three weeks,
according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 27 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 11 a.m. in
 London , the most expensive since Sept. 5, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The cost has increased from minus 17 on
Sept. 14, the cheapest since June 2011.  The one-year basis swap was 27 basis points, or 0.27
percentage point, below Euribor from minus 26 on Sept. 28.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they see each other
lending in euros, rose to 0.223 percent from a record low 0.220
percent on Sept. 28. The benchmark, derived from a daily survey
of banks for the European Banking Federation, rose for the first
time since June 28.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another held near the lowest since March 2011. The
difference between Euribor and overnight index swaps, known as
the Euribor-OIS spread, was little changed at 13.3 basis points.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.107
percent on Sept. 28, the highest since Sept. 6, from 0.095 the
day before. The Eonia swap, an estimate of average overnight
borrowing costs over the next three months, was little changed
at 8.5 basis points.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the  European
Central Bank  on Sept. 28, placing 316 billion euros ($406
billion) with the Frankfurt-based central bank from 289 billion
euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
