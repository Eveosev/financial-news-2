The U.S. needs to address rising debt
and reduce political discord if it wants further investment from
foreign companies such as  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , the top U.S. executive
for Europe’s biggest carmaker said.  “This country needs to get its house in order,”  Jonathan Browning , VW’s U.S. chief executive officer, said today in a
speech at the  Brookings Institution  in Washington. “It needs to
restore global confidence in the workings of its political
system.”  Browning cited the decision to select Mexico as the
location for the first North American plant for Audi, the
company’s luxury brand, as an example of the U.S. losing to
increasing global competition for foreign direct investment. It
doesn’t make sense for an auto company to build a plant in the
U.S. if it plans to export vehicles made there, he said.  Competition from India and China, where Volkswagen has 12
production plants and plans at least three more, is catching up
and the U.S. should pay attention, Browning said. Volkswagen,
based in Wolfsburg,  Germany , has its U.S. headquarters in
Herndon, Virginia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
