Axa Real Estate Investment Managers
has raised 1.4 billion euros ($1.8 billion) for commercial
property loans in Europe and plans to lend 2.4 billion euros
this year.  Fundraising this year will increase Axa Real Estate’s debt
program to about 7 billion euros, the unit of Paris-based  Axa SA (CS) 
said in a statement. The company plans to secure about 2 billion
euros of investment capacity this year, it said.  More than 580 billion euros of European commercial property
loans mature this year and next, real estate broker DTZ
estimates. Non-bank lenders such as Axa Real Estate may lend as
much as $75 billion for property in the region through 2013, the
broker estimates.  “The retreat, and in some instances the withdrawal
altogether, of traditional senior lenders in the  property market 
has accelerated further throughout 2012, making the
supply/demand imbalance more acute,” Isabelle Scemama, Axa’s
head of commercial property said in the statement.  Axa has been buying up property debt from other lenders,
including the 800 million-euro purchase of a portfolio from
 Societe Generale SA (GLE)  in June, according to the statement.  Axa had focused on the U.K. and French markets and is now
looking to lend in Germany, the Netherlands, the  Nordic
countries  and  Switzerland , it said in the statement.  “To be active on this market, you need large investment
capacity,” Scemama said in an August interview. “It’s an
exciting time for us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
