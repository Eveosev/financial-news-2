A possible referendum on  Slovenia ’s
sovereign wealth fund would delay the formation of the body
meant to put state assets under its control by two or three
months, Finance Minister Janez Sustersic said in an  interview 
with public broadcaster TV Slovenija.  The threat by the opposition Social Democrats to call a
plebiscite on the fund, which was approved by Parliament on
Sept. 28, “would not be an optimal way to move forward,”
Sustersic told the broadcaster late yesterday.  The wealth fund is designed to manage assets worth more
than 10 billion euros ($12.8 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
