France ’s financial markets regulator
fined an  investment company  and one of its officials a total of
200,000 euros ($258,000) for encouraging wealthy clients to
invest in funds linked to Ponzi scheme operator  Bernard Madoff .  The Autorite des Marches Financiers faulted them for
selling a financial product not licensed for distribution in
France, according to the  decision  on the AMF website. The
company was also rebuked for inadequate risk controls.  The regulator declined to name the firm, which was asked to
pay 180,000 euros, because it was bought by another company in
2011 that wasn’t at fault. The firm has sought to compensate its
clients, the AMF said. Lawyers listed in the decision as
representing them didn’t immediately return calls for comment.  Madoff was arrested almost four years ago and is serving a
150-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to fraud. The AMF
estimated soon after his arrest that French investors may have
lost as much as 500 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
