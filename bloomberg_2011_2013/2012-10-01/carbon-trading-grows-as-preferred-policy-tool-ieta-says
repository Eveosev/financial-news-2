The expansion of carbon-trading
mechanisms demonstrates that emission markets are the “policy
instrument of choice” for cutting  greenhouse gases , according
to the International Emissions Trading Association.  New carbon markets are developing in several regions,
including Australia, California, Chile,  South Korea  and China,
IETA said in an annual report published today.  “These schemes all have their own timelines but are
emerging as evidence that market-based trading systems are on
the rise in both the developed and developing world,” IETA
President Dirk Forrister said in the report.  The growth of new trading mechanisms requires policy
coordination and linkage where possible to “guard against a
disjointed and complex global carbon market,” Forrister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
