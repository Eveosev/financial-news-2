Gulf Coast gasoline rose on
speculation that outages at Petroleos de  Venezuela  SA’s Amuay
plant and Irving Oil Corp.’s Saint John refinery will boost
demand for shipments from Texas and Louisiana.  Amuay, shut after an Aug. 25 explosion, is running at half
of capacity and may not return to full operation for three to
four months, Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional reported last
week. The Saint John facility in  New Brunswick  expects to
complete maintenance by the end of October, Lesley Dickson, a
company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  The largest refinery in Venezuela, Amuay is a major fuel
supplier to the Caribbean. Saint John sends more than half of
its output to the East Coast, where  stocks  of reformulated
gasoline, or RBOB, dropped to 13.7 million barrels last week,
Energy Department data show.  “These refineries are a big deal because that’s where a
lot of gasoline gets delivered from and that’s why we’re seeing
tighter supply,” Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks &
Opinions, LLC, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters
in  New York  today. “People are playing it safe and buying in
right now rather than waiting.”  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline on the
 Gulf Coast  advanced by 1 cent to 4.75 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:06 p.m.  The fuel in New York Harbor dropped by 0.5 cent to 47.5
cents a gallon, after ending Friday at 6 cents over October
futures, or about 48 cents over November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
