The first person charged as part of
the  News Corp. (NWSA)  tabloid bribery scandal in Britain appeared in a
London criminal court today charged with offering to sell
information to the now-defunct News of the World.  April Casburn, a detective chief inspector with the
 Metropolitan Police Service , was ordered to appear at a higher
criminal court for a further hearing on Nov. 2. She is charged
with breaching the U.K. Official Secrets Act and misconduct in a
public office.  She was charged in London police’s Operation Elveden, one
of three probes stemming from wrongdoing by journalists at the
News of the World. News Corp. Chairman  Rupert Murdoch  closed the
newspaper in July 2011 to help quell public anger over the
phone-hacking scandal.  The allegations related to breaching the official secrets
act emerged after reporting restrictions were lifted by Judge
Quentin Purdy at Westminster Magistrates Court today, a
spokeswoman for the CPS said.  Eight people have been charged in the phone-hacking probe,
including Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive officer of
News Corp.’s U.K. publishing unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
