Fiat SpA (F)  may delay building plant in
 St. Petersburg , Russia’s second-biggest city, because of
overcapacity in  Europe , said Sergey Vyazalov, the vice governor
of city’s region.  The carmaker’s officials, who planned the 850 million-euro
($1 billion) facility with annual capacity of 120,000 units in
2013, haven’t contacted the regional administration for three
months and haven’t presented an investment plan, said Vyazalov.  “The company has enough capacity in Europe to deliver cars
to the Russian market,” he said. “So I expect it will delay
the project for several years.”  The Italian carmaker keeps working on its strategy to
expand in Russia as it’s defining details of the plan with
Russian banks, Fiat Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne 
told reporters on Sept. 28 in Paris.  “There is a boom in the market, we made the right choose
to enter it with our Jeep brand,” said Marchionne. Italian car
plants are running at 50 percent capacity, he said.  New car sales in Russia grew 15 percent to 1.9 million in
the first eight months of this year from the same period a year
earlier, according to the Association of European Business
 survey . Fiat brand sales dropped 74 percent to 5,054 as the Jeep
brand sales tripled to 2,957 vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
