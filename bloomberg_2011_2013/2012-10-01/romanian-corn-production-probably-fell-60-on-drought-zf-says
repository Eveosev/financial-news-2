Romania â€™s corn production probably
dropped 60 percent from a year earlier because of a drought that
damaged crops, Ziarul Financiar  reported , citing estimates from
the Agriculture Ministry.  The country probably harvested 4.7 million metric tons of
corn this year compared with 11.7 million tons in 2011,
according to the Bucharest-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
