JJB Sports Plc (JJB) , a U.K. sporting goods
retailer, will close most of its stores with the loss of about
2,200 jobs after attempts to rescue the business failed.  A total of 133 outlets will be shut, with the remaining 20
being acquired by competitor  Sports Direct International Plc, (SPD) 
according to a statement from KPMG LLP, which was today
appointed as administrator to the Wigan, England-based company.  JJB, founded in the 1970s by former professional soccer
player David Whelan, has struggled to cope with increased
competition from supermarkets and rivals such as Sports Direct.
Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc., the largest U.S. athletic chain, in
August wrote off a 20 million-pound ($32 million) investment it
made in April. Last year, JJB twice raised money from investors,
refinanced its debt and avoided going into administration after
reaching agreement with landlords and other creditors.  An auction process for the retailer attracted interest from
more than 100 parties and led to eight first-round bids from
trade and private-equity buyers, David McCorquodale, the KPMG
corporate finance partner who led the sales process, said in a
statement. Most were put off by the amount of cash and further
restructuring that would have been required, he said.  Sports Direct said it will pay 23.77 million pounds for the
20 stores, most of JJB’s inventory and the Slazenger golf brand
licenses, as well as the freehold property in Wigan. A further
sum of as much as 0.25 million pounds will be payable after a
stock take.  To contact the reporter on this story:
