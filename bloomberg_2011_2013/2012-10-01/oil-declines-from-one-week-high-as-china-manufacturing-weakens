Oil rose for a third day in  New York 
as stress-test results bolstered confidence in the Spanish
banking system, buoying optimism that  Europe ’s debt crisis can
be contained.  Futures gained as much as 0.9 percent, reversing an earlier
loss. Spanish stress tests reported a capital deficit of 59.3
billion euros ($76 billion), less than the 100 billion euros
agreed as part of a bailout. Crude retreated earlier as
manufacturing contracted unexpectedly in  China .  “I think we’ve seen the worst” of Europe’s turmoil, said
Michael Poulsen, an analyst at Global Risk Management in
Middelfart,  Denmark , who predicts  Brent crude  prices will
average $112 a barrel this quarter. “On average, we see prices
ending the year at roughly the same level as now, but there are
some wild cards.”  Crude for November delivery advanced as much as 84 cents to
$93.03 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and was at
$92.93 at 2:05 p.m. London time. It had fallen as much as 93
cents to $91.26 a barrel. Prices rose 8.5 percent in the third
quarter.  Brent oil for November settlement gained 36 cents to
$112.75 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The European benchmark grade’s premium to New York
crude was at $19.83, compared with a six-week closing high of
$20.20 reached on Sept. 28.  Brent Forecast  Bank of America Corp. said that Brent crude may advance to
$120 a barrel by the end of the year, and raised its fourth-
quarter forecast for the oil benchmark by $6, citing stronger
prospects for the global economy.  Risks to world growth have been eased by stimulus measures
taken by central banks, analysts including Francisco Blanch in
New York and Sabine Schels in  London  said in a report. Bank of
America bolstered its fourth-quarter estimate for the grade to
$114 a barrel from $108.  Oil’s decline in New York may stall along its 100-day
moving average, at $90.10 a barrel today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Futures last week rebounded after falling
to this indicator. Buy orders tend to be clustered near
technical-support levels.  Chinese Manufacturing  China’s manufacturing shrank for a second month for the
first time since 2009, the National Bureau of Statistics and
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today. The
report added to signs that growth is at risk of reaching a 22-
year low as the ruling Communist Party prepares to begin
installing a new generation of leaders next month.  “China PMI was not so good,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a sales
manager at Newedge Group in  Tokyo . “Eleven straight months of
negative numbers has had some bearish impact on  oil prices .”  OPEC production fell the most in 18 months in September,
led by reductions in Angola and  Nigeria , a Bloomberg survey
showed. Output in the 12-member Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries slipped 454,000 barrels, or 1.4 percent, to
an average 31.979 million barrels a day last month from a
revised 32.433 million in August, according to the survey of  oil
companies , producers and analysts.  Money managers reduced  wagers  on rising prices for the
first time in six weeks, cutting net-long positions by 17
percent in the seven days ended Sept. 25, according to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders
report on Sept. 28. It was the biggest reduction since May 8.  In London,  hedge funds  and other speculators reduced
 bullish bets  on Brent crude to their lowest level in more than a
month in the week ended Sept. 25, according to data from ICE
Futures Europe.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 107,127 lots,
the London-based exchange said today in its weekly Commitment of
Traders report. That’s a reduction of 837 contracts from 107,964
last week, and the lowest since the period to Aug. 21.  -- Editors: Rachel Graham, Raj Rajendran  To contact the reporters on this story:
