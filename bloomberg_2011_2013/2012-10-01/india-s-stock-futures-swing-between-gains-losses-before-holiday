India’s (SENSEX)  benchmark stock index rose to
a 14-month high as foreign funds increased their holdings of
domestic equities amid optimism the government will undertake
measures to bolster growth.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose 0.3 percent
to 18,823.91, the highest close since July 2011.  Tata Motors
Ltd. (TTMT) , owner of Jaguar Land Rover,  Infosys Ltd. (INFO)  and  Jindal Steel
& Power Ltd. (JSP)  gained at least 2 percent. The market is closed
tomorrow for a public holiday.  Indian equities had their biggest monthly advance since
January last month as foreign funds bought shares worth $3.6
billion through Sept. 27 amid a burst of policy announcements
aimed at reviving an economy growing at near its slowest pace in
three years. The government will consider easing investment
rules for insurance companies, Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told reporters in New Delhi today.  “The market is headed for a record high, possibly by the
year-end,” Chokkalingam G, chief investment officer at Centrum
Broking in Mumbai, told Bloomberg TV  India . “I’m expecting a
few more policy reforms, increased foreign direct investments
and a stronger rupee to drive the rally.” The Sensex closed at
its highest ever level of 21,004.96 on Nov. 5, 2010.  The stock gauge increased 7.7 percent last month and has
jumped 4.5 percent since Sept. 13 after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ended a freeze on  diesel prices  to cut the budget deficit
and opened retailing and airlines to foreigners the next day.
Singh approved on Sept. 24 a plan to recast short-term loans
held by state-owned utilities to help them meet power-supply
commitments, extending the biggest policy push of his second
term in office.  Record Flows  The Sensex has surged 22 percent this year, helped by the
highest inflows among 10 Asian markets for which Bloomberg
compiles such data, excluding  China . Overseas  funds  bought a net
 $118.5 million  of stocks on Sept. 27, raising investments into
local equities this year to $15.9 billion, data from the
regulator show. The flows pushed up the rupee 5.3 percent in the
three months ended September, the strongest quarterly gain since
2009 and the best performance among Asian currencies.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index added 0.3 percent to 5,718.80 and
its October futures closed at 5,758.75. The BSE-200 Index rose
0.4 percent to 2,317.6. The National Stock Exchange of India and
the BSE Ltd. traded 1.1 billion shares on Sept. 28, 19 percent
more than the 12-month daily average of 897 million.  Tata Motors, the maker of the world’s cheapest car, the
Nano, increased 2.7 percent to 275 rupees. Infosys soared 3
percent to 2,609.65 rupees. Jindal Steel jumped 2.2 percent to
436.7 rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
