German plant and machinery orders
fell for a tenth month in August, driven by a fresh slump in
domestic demand, the VDMA machine-makers’ association said.  Orders, adjusted for inflation, fell 11 percent from a year
earlier after dropping an annual 2 percent in July, the
Frankfurt-based VDMA said in an e-mailed statement today.
Domestic orders fell 18 percent, equaling the biggest drop since
2009, while orders from abroad declined 6 percent from a year
earlier. In the three months through August, orders fell 4
percent from the same period last year.  “Business at home again disappointed,” VDMA chief
economist  Ralph Wiechers  said in the statement. “This time,
orders from abroad couldn’t compensate either. As an expression
of the high level of uncertainty, fewer orders came from both
euro-partner countries and non-euro states.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
