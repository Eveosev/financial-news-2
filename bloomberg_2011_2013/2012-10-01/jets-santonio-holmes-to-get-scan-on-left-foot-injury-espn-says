New York Jets wide receiver  Santonio
Holmes  will undergo a scan today after injuring his left foot in
yesterday’s 34-0 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, ESPN reports,
citing an unidentified person familiar with the situation.  Holmes underwent X-rays yesterday that showed no broken
bones, ESPN said, though his foot was in a boot when he left the
locker room. His injury came a week after the Jets lost All-Pro
cornerback  Darrelle Revis  to a torn knee ligament.  Holmes, who had a team-leading 16 catches for 243 yards
through the Jets’ first three games, went down without contact
after catching a four-yard pass during the third quarter
yesterday. He fumbled and the 49ers’ Carlos Rogers recovered the
ball and returned it 51 yards for a touchdown.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
