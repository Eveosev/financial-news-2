Paul Volcker , former chairman of the
 Federal Reserve , said the U.S. central bank’s latest bond-buying
program isn’t creating inflationary pressure.  “It’s not going to have a profound effect on the economy
and it’s not going to have any effect on inflation in the short
run,” Volcker said today at a forum sponsored by Bloomberg Link
at the  New York  Athletic Club. “The basic situation is not an
inflationary situation.”  The Fed has held its target interest rate near zero since
2008. It announced a third round of quantitative easing Sept.
13, committing to $40 billion in monthly purchases of mortgage-
backed securities. Volcker, known for taming inflation in the
1980s, said the Fed can reverse its actions when the economy
improves.  Volcker, 85, said he was confident that regulators will
enact the proprietary-trading ban named for him, which is part
of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act overhauling financial-market rules.  “I don’t know what the new regulation will say but I think
it’s less complicated than people are making it out to be,”
said Volcker, who was interviewed in front of an audience by
former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman  Arthur Levitt .  Dodd-Frank allows regulators to largely define the law’s
provisions. Rules may be complete by the end of the year,
regulators have said. Asked by a banker in the audience whether
the Volcker rule would have been ineffectual in preventing the
mortgage boom and bust, the former Fed chief defended the ban.  “That’s nonsense,” Volcker said. “Don’t tell me there
was no speculation, for God’s sake.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
