South Korea , Asia’s fourth-largest
economy, increased oil imports in September by 0.3 percent from
a year earlier.  The country, which buys all its crude from overseas,
purchased 80.8 million barrels last month, the Ministry of
 Knowledge Economy  said in an e-mailed statement today, citing
preliminary estimates. That’s up from 80.55 million a year ago.  The country’s bill for imports rose 2.7 percent to $9.1
billion as prices based on Middle East benchmark Dubai crude
gained 5.1 percent to $111.2 a barrel, the ministry said.  The country’s natural-gas import bill decreased 18.8
percent to $2.6 billion in September while costs for coal
purchases fell 34 percent to $1.3 billion, according to the
ministry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
