New Zealand ’s  economic growth  is
slowing in the second half of 2012 amid weakness in
manufacturing, exports and consumer spending, according to the
Treasury Department.  There is a risk that growth in the three months through
September may be less than the 0.6 percent expected, the
Wellington-based department said in a report on its  website .
Gross domestic product expanded 0.6 percent in the second
quarter following a 1 percent pace in the first three months.  “The outlook is not without its headwinds, with parts of
the economy looking to have lost momentum over recent months,”
the Treasury said in its monthly report, which doesn’t contain
new forecasts.  Manufacturing and the services industries are slowing,
adding to signs of a sluggish end to 2012, the Treasury said.
Slow growth adds to the case for the central bank to keep the
official cash rate at a record-low 2.5 percent until next year.  Nine of 16 economists surveyed last week by  Bloomberg News 
expect no change in borrowing costs until the second half of
2013. Four see an increase in the first quarter and three
predict a rise in the second quarter from the current rate.  Employment confidence rose in the third quarter and is
still the second-lowest since the the 2008-09 recession,
according to a survey today from  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  Reports
last month showed manufacturing contracted at a faster pace
while the services industry was the weakest since October 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
