Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the world’s biggest
offshore driller, can keep renting equipment to  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PBR)  after Brazil’s top court partially lifted a ban on
operations related to an oil spill.  The Superior Court of Justice allowed Transocean to
continue operating its rigs in Brazil, except for the Frade
project that is operated by  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , Transocean said in a
statement distributed by Marketwire yesterday. Eight of
Transocean’s nine other rigs in Brazil are under contract with
Petrobras, as the state-controlled producer is known.  Chevron had an oil spill at Frade last year while using one
of Transocean’s rigs and halted production in the area in March
to study the geology around the accident site. A court ordered
Transocean on Sept. 27 to halt drilling within 30 days as part
of a criminal case over spill damages. Transocean is pursuing a
“complete resolution” of the cases in Brazil, it said.  “The company experienced no interruption of contract
revenue from its operations in Brazil which, for the six months
ended June 30, 2012, comprised approximately 11 percent of its
consolidated operating revenues,” Transocean said.  Transocean fell 1.1 percent to $44.89 on Sept. 28 in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
