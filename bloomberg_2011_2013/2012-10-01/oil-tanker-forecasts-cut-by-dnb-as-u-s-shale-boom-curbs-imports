Earnings for the biggest crude
tankers will be 25 percent lower next year than previously
estimated as increased U.S. shale-oil production curbs imports
into the country, DNB ASA said.  Very large crude carriers will earn $21,000 a day on
average in 2013 and $22,000 in the following year, 24 percent
below its prior estimate, the Oslo-based bank said in a report
dated Sept. 27. Smaller Suezmax vessels will bring in $18,000
daily next year, a 25 percent reduction.  “U.S. seaborne imports of crude oil are set to be
dramatically reduced in the coming years, mainly due to the
large expected increase in domestic crude production,” analysts
including Nicolay Dyvik said. “All else equal, this will be
negative for the crude oil tanker market.”  Annual imports into the U.S., the world’s biggest oil
consumer, are set to fall by 550,000 barrels a day, DNB
estimated. Each VLCC can hold 2 million barrels of crude, double
the capacity of a Suezmax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
