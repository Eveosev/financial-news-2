The biggest restrictions on rubber
exports since 2009 and record consumption are sending prices
back to a bull market after a five-month slump, increasing costs
for  Bridgestone Corp. (5108)  and other tiremakers.  Thailand ,  Indonesia  and  Malaysia , accounting for 70 percent
of global output, agreed to cut shipments by 300,000 metric
tons, starting yesterday. That’s as much as  China , the biggest
user, imports in about five weeks and exceeds the 2013 supply
surplus forecast by the International Rubber Study Group, which
represents 35 nations. Tokyo-traded futures, a global benchmark,
will advance 9.8 percent to 300 yen a kilogram ($3,841 a ton) by
the end of the year, according to the median of 12 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Producers are cutting sales to boost prices that tumbled 49
percent since reaching a record in February 2011 because of a
supply glut and weaker economic growth. When they reduced
cargoes in 2009, futures more than doubled that year. The latest
curbs are coming as policy makers from the Federal Reserve to
the European Central Bank pledge to buy more debt to bolster
economies. The Singapore-based rubber group predicts record
demand again in 2013.  “The bear market is over,” said Makoto Sugitani, the head
of commodity derivatives sales at Newedge Japan Inc. in  Tokyo 
who correctly predicted in September 2010 that prices would
advance 20 percent within six months. “The easing has spurred
fund flows into equities and commodities and export cuts by the
three producers will support prices.”  Tripartite Council  After rallying 33 percent since mid-August on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, futures are 3.7 percent higher for the year
at 273.2 yen. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot  Index (MXWD)  of 24 raw
materials increased 3 percent since the start of January, and
the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities advanced 11
percent. Treasuries returned 2.3 percent, a Bank of America
Corp. index shows.  The three Southeast Asian producers will cut 180,000 tons
of exports in the fourth quarter and 120,000 tons in the first
three months of next year, their International Tripartite
Council said Aug. 29. They will probably store the rubber until
prices improve, said Yium Tavarolit, the chief secretary of the
International Rubber Consortium Ltd., a unit of the council.  The  countries  also agreed to cut down aging trees across
100,000 hectares (247,000 acres) of plantations, an area about
50 percent greater than  Singapore . The program, which will
remove 150,000 tons of annual production, should start at the
end of the harvest in February, said Yium.  Annual Supply  Thailand, the biggest supplier, will spend 30 billion baht
($974 million) buying at least 300,000 tons from farmers at
above-market rates to boost prices, Deputy Farm Minister
 Nattawut Saikuar  said Sept. 13. That extends an existing plan
that already acquired 100,000 tons for 15 billion baht, he said.  Production will rise 3.2 percent to 11.3 million tons this
year, outpacing a 2.5 percent gain in demand to 11.2 million
tons, according to the  rubber study group.  That values annual
supply at about $40 billion. Output will expand 4.4 percent to
11.8 million tons in 2013, exceeding a 4.3 percent gain in
consumption to 11.7 million tons, the group estimates.  While prices more than doubled from the end of 2008 through
June 2011 as the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two bouts
of so-called quantitative easing, the impact of the third round
announced Sept. 13 may be more muted. Weakening global growth
means central-bank stimulus probably won’t be a “game changer”
for many commodities, Barclays Plc said in a report Sept. 25.  Biggest Tiremaker  Stockpiling and limiting shipments will only diminish the
glut temporarily, said  Kazuhiko Saito , the chief analyst at
Fujitomi Co., a brokerage in Tokyo. The planned export
restrictions are smaller than the 690,000 tons removed in 2009.  While global tire demand is no longer weakening, it has yet
to rebound, said Kaoru Tomizawa, a spokesman for Tokyo-based
Bridgestone, the world’s biggest tiremaker. The company will use
980,000 tons of natural and synthetic rubber in the second half,
below an earlier estimate of 1 million tons, he said. First-half
consumption was 7 percent smaller than planned. About 80 percent
of natural rubber goes into tires, says Deutsche Bank AG.  Truck sales fell 6 percent in the first eight months in
China, which represents 34 percent of demand for natural rubber,
data from the  China Association of Automobile Manufacturers 
show. As much as 23 kilograms (51 pounds) of natural rubber is
needed to make a tire for a medium to heavy commercial vehicle,
according to CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, a brokerage and
investment group.  Light Vehicles  The sales slide will probably end next year, with Chinese
truck purchases increasing 10 percent as policy makers add
stimulus to bolster economic growth, said Zita Zigan, head of
global commercial vehicle forecasting at LMC Automotive Ltd. in
Oxford,  England .  Global sales of light vehicles probably will grow 6.5
percent, from 5.2 percent in 2012, LMC Automotive estimates. As
much as 1.6 kilograms of natural rubber is used in a passenger-
car tire, according to Jeremie Capron, an analyst at CLSA in
Singapore.  Production growth in Thailand likely will slow to 1.2
percent this year from 9.7 percent in 2011, the Association of
Natural Rubber Producing Countries estimates. Output in
Indonesia, the second-biggest, will climb 7.7 percent, from 11
percent, according to the Kuala Lumpur-based group, whose
members represent about 93 percent of supply.  Stockpiles in warehouses monitored by the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange  fell  to 3,441 short tons (3,122 metric tons) by Sept.
20, bourse data show. That’s the lowest in 13 months and 71
percent below this year’s peak of 11,886 tons on May 10.  “Rubber has bottomed out,” said  Tetsu Emori , the Tokyo-
based fund manager at Astmax Co., who helps manage about 35
billion yen of assets. “The uptrend is set to continue.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
