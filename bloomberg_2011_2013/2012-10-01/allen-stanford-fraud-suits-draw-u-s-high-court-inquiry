The U.S. Supreme Court signaled
interest in using a case involving investors in R. Allen Stanford’s $7 billion Ponzi scheme to spell out the reach of a
1998 law aimed at limiting securities-fraud lawsuits.  The justices today sought the Obama administration’s advice
on appeals of a ruling that let aggrieved investors sue law
firms and outside companies for their alleged roles in
Stanford’s international fraud. The issue in the case also has
arisen in suits stemming from  Bernard Madoff ’s fraud.  Should the court take up the case, it would test a law
enacted to prevent investors from using state courts to
circumvent federal restrictions on class-action securities
claims. Federal law prohibits punitive damages, requires higher
levels of proof than many state laws and bars “aiding and
abetting” suits.  The 1998 law, known as the Securities Litigation Uniform
Standards Act, or SLUSA, bars investors from using state law to
file class-action lawsuits if the case is based on a
misrepresentation made “in connection with the purchase or sale
of a covered security.”  The question in the appeals is how close that connection
must be to bar a state lawsuit. Lower courts have established a
variety of tests.  The Supreme Court cases are Chadbourne & Park v. Troice,
12-79; Willis v. Troice, 12-86; and  Proskauer Rose  v. Troice,
12-88.  To contact the reporter on this story:
