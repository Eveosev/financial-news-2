(Corrects number in second paragraph.)  Wheat surged the most in three
months after a government report showed  stockpiles  were lower
than expected in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter, as
demand climbed.  Inventories on Sept. 1 totaled 2.1 billion bushels, down 2
percent from a year earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected 2.272 billion
bushels. In the three months ended Aug. 31, consumption rose 27
percent from a year earlier, USDA data show. Prices had dropped
4.7 percent in the prior four sessions amid concern that demand
was slowing.  The USDA “must have increased” its estimate of the amount
exported and fed to livestock,  Brian Hoops , the president of
Midwest Market Solutions in Springfield, Missouri, said by
telephone. “We’ve been beating up on the grain market this
week. The uncertainty will alleviate any selling pressure.”  Wheat futures for December delivery jumped 5.5 percent to
settle at $9.025 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest increase since June 25. The most-active
contract advanced 19 percent in the quarter.  The London-based International Grains Council said today
that wheat  production  globally will total 657 million metric
tons, down from an August forecast of 662 million tons. Global
stockpiles will fall to 175 million tons, down 2.8 percent from
last month’s forecast, IGC data show.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
