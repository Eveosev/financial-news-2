The dollar fell from the strongest
level in three weeks against the euro as a gauge of U.S.
manufacturing unexpectedly rose, damping demand for the refuge
of U.S. government securities.  The 17-nation currency rose versus all of its 16 most-
traded peers except  Mexico ’s peso after Spain’s latest banking
and budget measures spurred bets the euro bloc is moving closer
to curbing its debt crisis. It pared gains as risk appetite
slipped and stocks trimmed an advance. The peso advanced as the
Institute for Supply Management’s U.S.  factory index  gained last
month for the first time since May.  “The euro-dollar move is more of a dollar-lower view,”
Dan Dorrow, head of research in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , at Faros
Trading LLC, said in a telephone interview. “We had a pop in
risk right after we got the ISM manufacturing numbers, which
caused the euro’s biggest spike on the day against the dollar.”  The dollar depreciated 0.2 percent to $1.2888 at 5 p.m. New
York time, after gaining earlier as much as 0.4 percent to
$1.2804, the strongest since Sept. 11.  Japan ’s currency was
little changed at 77.99 against the greenback. The euro advanced
0.3 percent to 100.52 yen.  The Australian dollar touched the lowest level in more than
a year against its New Zealand counterpart before the Reserve
Bank of  Australia  holds a policy meeting tomorrow. The Aussie
reached NZ$1.2469, the lowest since September 2011, before
erasing losses to trade at NZ$1.2519. The currency fell 0.2
percent to $1.0361.  Low Volatility  Implied volatility, which signals the expected pace of
currency swings, was at almost five-year lows. It was 7.89 after
touching 7.73 on Sept. 28, its lowest since October 2007, a
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  index  for the currencies of Group of Seven
nations showed. Lower volatility makes investments in currencies
with higher benchmark lending rates more attractive because the
risk in such trades is that market moves will erase profit.  Europe ’s shared currency fell below its 200-day moving
average of $1.2824 before erasing losses. It has closed higher
than the average every day since Sept. 11.  “The thing that’s been keeping the euro up today is
technicals,” Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist for Gain
Capital Group LLC in New York. “That 200-day moving average is
something we’ve been looking at for a while, and a lot of people
have been talking about it. Even thought there was a test below
on an intraday basis, it’s been holding up as support there.
It’s a pretty key pivot.” Support is an area on a chart where
buy orders may be clustered.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rallied as much as 1.1
percent before reducing the gain to 0.3 percent.  Factory Gauge  The ISM’s index of U.S. manufacturing rose to 51.5 in
September, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. A
Bloomberg survey projected a reading of 49.7. The dividing line
between expansion and contraction is 50.  Mexico’s peso strengthened after the report boosted the
economic outlook for the nation’s chief trading partner. The
currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 12.8279 to the greenback. It
was little changed at 16.5362 per euro.  “Euro-Mexican is a play that we like,”  Jens Nordvig ,
managing director of currency research in New York at Nomura
Holdings Inc., said today in a television interview on
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Sara Eisen.
“Growth has been declining all over the world; the only country
that’s holding up is Mexico.”  India ’s rupee climbed against all of its most-traded peers,
gaining 0.9 percent to 52.3950 per dollar.  ‘Very Hopeful’  The euro rose versus major peers even after reports showed
manufacturing in the currency bloc contracted for a 14th month
in September.  “Much of the negative news has been discounted, and we’re
in a position whereby the market is still very hopeful that
we’re moving in Europe toward some more positive news with
regards to Spain,” said Ian Stannard, head of European foreign-
exchange strategy at Morgan Stanley in  London .  A gauge of European  manufacturing  based on a survey of
purchasing managers was 46.1, Markit said today. The index has
held for 14 months below 50, indicating contraction.  Spain’s  10-year bonds  rose for a third day, pushing the
yield down six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.88
percent. A stress test of the nation’s banks, undertaken as part
of terms to win external financial aid of as much as 100 billion
euros ($129 billion) and released last week, showed a deficit of
59.3 billion euros.  The euro lost 3.1 percent over the past six months, the
biggest drop after the Swiss franc among 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes.
The dollar rose 0.5 percent, and the yen jumped 6.4 percent.  Dollar Index  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the currency against those of six U.S. trading
partners, declined 0.1 percent to 79.822 after rising earlier to
80.147, the highest since Sept. 11.  The benchmark gauge may appreciate to the 80.53-to-80.73
area after reversing from its September low of 78.60, Niall O’Connor, a New York-based technical analyst at JPMorgan, wrote
today in a note to clients. If the index fails to exceed that
level, it may slide to 79 to 79.36 and then drop to 78.09, its
low of the year, O’Connor said.  The Fed announced Sept. 13 it would buy $40 billion of
mortgage-backed debt a month until the economic recovery is
well-established. The U.S. jobless rate has been stuck above 8
percent for 43 straight months.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said policy makers
“expect that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy
will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the
economy strengthens.” He gave a speech today in Indianapolis.  South Africa’s rand lost the most among major currencies
today, falling 0.8 percent to 8.3825 per dollar, as the nation’s
factory output slid to a three-year low. A purchasing managers’
index fell to 46.2 last month from 51 in August, Kagiso Tiso
Holdings said. A level below 50 indicates contraction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
