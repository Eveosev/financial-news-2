Finavera Wind Energy Inc. (FVR) , the
Vancouver-based wind-farm developer proposing to build projects
in Canada and Ireland, rose the most in almost 11 months after
saying it’s in talks with three potential buyers.  Finavera gained 40 percent to 34 Canadian cents at the
close in Toronto, the biggest climb since Nov. 11. As of Sept.
28, the company had declined 44 percent this year.  Finavera, which has a market value of C$12.5 million ($12.7
million), “intends to move expeditiously to explore transaction
proposals and consummate a transaction in the near term,”
according to a statement today. Finavera appointed Capital West
Partners LLC to review offers.  The decision to put itself up for sale means it won’t
complete an agreement, announced in July, to sell its Wildmare
wind project in British Columbia to  Innergex Renewable Energy
Inc. (INE)  for C$22 million, according to the statement.  The falling share price “has resulted in a significant
difference between our market capitalization and our inherent
value,” Chief Executive Officer Jason Bak said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
