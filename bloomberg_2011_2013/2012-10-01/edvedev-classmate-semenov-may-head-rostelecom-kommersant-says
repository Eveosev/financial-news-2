Alexander Provotorov, the CEO of OAO
Rostelecom,  Russia ’s largest fixed-line and long-distance phone
operator, may be replaced soon,  Kommersant  reported.  Vadim Semenov, who heads Svyazinvest, Rostelecom’s state-
run holding company, may take over from him, the newspaper said,
citing proposals by the Telecommunications Ministry. Semenov, a
classmate of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, may combine the two
positions as the companies are set to merge next year,
Kommersant said, citing unidentified people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
