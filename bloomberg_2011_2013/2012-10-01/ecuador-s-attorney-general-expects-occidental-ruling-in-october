Ecuador ’s government expects a World
Bank arbitration panel to reach a decision this month in a $3.37
billion dispute with  Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) , the largest
onshore crude producer in the continental U.S.  The World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes has finished all stages of the arbitration
process and should announce its final decision by Oct. 9,
Ecuador’s Attorney General’s office, which represents the
government in the case, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Ecuador’s government said it shouldn’t be required to pay
the Los Angeles-based oil company more than $417 million,
according to the Attorney General’s office. Occidental is
requesting $3.37 billion, according to the statement.  Ecuador stripped Occidental of its oil concession in 2006
over an alleged contract breach, prompting the company’s
complaint to the panel.  Occidental’s press office didn’t immediately respond to a
telephone message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
