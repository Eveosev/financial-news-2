Manufacturing in the Netherlands
expanded for the first time in seven months, driven by an
increase in export orders, according to NEVI, the Dutch
institute for purchasing and supply management.  The September index of manufacturing in the euro area’s
fifth-largest economy rose to 50.7 from 49.7 in August, the
Zoetermeer, Netherlands-based institute said in an e-mailed
statement. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion.  New orders, mainly from foreign countries, were the most
important reason for the index’s gain, NEVI said. Sales prices
declined for a third month while purchasing prices rose.
Production rose slightly while work in progress continued to
fall, it said.  The index is based on a survey of about 350 purchasing
managers by Markit Economics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
