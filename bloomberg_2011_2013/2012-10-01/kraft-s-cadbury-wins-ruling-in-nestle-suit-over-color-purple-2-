Kraft Foods Inc.’s Cadbury unit won a trademark case brought by  Nestle SA (NESN)  over purple packaging for chocolate, after a London judge found the color was distinctive to the maker of Dairy Milk bars.  Nestle, the world’s biggest food company, challenged a trademark ruling from December 2011 covering chocolate bars and drinks, saying a color shouldn’t be protected.  “The evidence clearly supports a finding that purple is distinctive of Cadbury for milk chocolate,” Judge Colin Birss wrote in rejecting Nestle’s appeal. Cadbury has used purple for its Dairy Milk bars since 1914, he said in today’s ruling.  Kraft became the world’s largest producer of chocolate candy when it bought Cadbury, based in the  London  suburb of Uxbridge, in 2010. The company had a 20.2 percent share of the western Europe chocolate confectionery market in 2011, according to Bloomberg Industries data. Nestle, which makes KitKat and Baby Ruth bars, has a 11.1 percent market share for the region.  The dispute dates back to 2008, when Vevey, Switzerland- based Nestle opposed Cadbury’s initial application for a color trademark.  Partial Victory  Today’s decision is a partial victory for Nestle as it “protects our brands by further limiting the range of goods for which Cadbury’s application may be registered,” Nestle spokesman James Maxton said in an e-mailed statement.
