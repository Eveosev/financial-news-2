Serbian police will ban a gay Pride
Parade for a second consecutive year, if security risks are
high, B92 web portal said, citing Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic .  Police banned the event in 2011 citing threats to public
safety following reports that extremists were preparing big
riots in Belgrade. More than 100 Serbian policemen and civilians
were injured and dozens more were arrested in skirmishes that
broke out at the Pride Parade in Belgrade in 2010, the first
public gay event in nine years.  This yearâ€™s parade is scheduled for Oct. 6, B92 said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
