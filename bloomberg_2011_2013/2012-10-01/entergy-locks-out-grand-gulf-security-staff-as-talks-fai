Entergy Corp. (ETR)  locked out security
workers at its Grand Gulf nuclear power plant after failing to
reach an agreement with United Government Security Officers of
America Local 36 before the union’s contract expired.  Entergy began using non-union workers and staff from other
plants and other security companies at the Mississippi reactor
after midnight local time, according to a statement today. Mike Bowling, a spokesman for New Orleans-based Entergy, declined to
say how many workers were affected by the contract dispute or
whether talks are continuing.  “Since those employees would have been working without a
contract, they would reserve the right to leave their posts and
strike at any time -- a situation that is unacceptable at an
Entergy nuclear plant,” Mike Balduzzi, senior vice president of
nuclear technical services, said in the statement.  Grand Gulf, located about 50 miles (80 kilometers)
southwest of Jackson,  Mississippi , was operating at full
capacity this morning, according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
