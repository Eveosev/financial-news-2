CenturyLink Inc. (CTL) , the phone company
that lost its investment-grade rating from  Standard & Poor’s 
last year, postponed a benchmark debt offering intended to help
redeem bonds issued by its Qwest Communications International
Inc. unit.  The company, which acquired Qwest for $23.8 billion in
2011, planned to issue 10-year bonds that may have yielded about
337 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and 30-
year securities at a relative yield of 450 basis points,
according to a person familiar with the transaction. The sale
was postponed because of market conditions, said the person, who
asked not to be identified, citing a lack of authorization to
speak publicly.  Proceeds were to be used for a redemption of Qwest’s $550
million of 8 percent, October 2015 debt at 104 percent and a
tender offer for $800 million of 7.125 percent, April 2018
bonds, the Monroe, Louisiana-based company said today in a
filing. The offering, which was to include an add-on to the
company’s 7.65 percent notes due in March 2042, was to be of
benchmark size, typically at least $500 million, the person
said.  The 2015 bonds traded on Sept. 4 at 104.7 cents on the
dollar, more than the price at which CenturyLink is calling
them, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The new bonds were to be rated Baa3, the lowest level of
investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service, the ratings
company said in a statement today. Standard & Poor’s said in a
separate statement that it assigned a grade two levels lower at
BB. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Royal Bank of Canada were managing
the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
