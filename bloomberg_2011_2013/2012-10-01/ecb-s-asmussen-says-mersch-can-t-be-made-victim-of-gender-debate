European Central Bank Executive Board
Member Joerg Asmussen said  Luxembourg ’s Yves Mersch shouldn’t be
held hostage in a debate on gender diversity in top European
Union posts as his move to the ECB board remains in limbo.  The appointment of Mersch has been stalled by a European
Parliament committee that protested against the absence of women
on the ECB’s six-member executive board. Asmussen said while
debates about more women in top EU posts are “correct,” it
isn’t right to use Luxembourg’s Central Bank governor as a means
to achieving this.  “It would help the ECB Executive Board in the current
difficult situation if we were quickly complete again, and to
have someone as stability-oriented as Yves Mersch would help us
a lot with his know-how and experience,” Asmussen said in a
speech in Vienna today.  The ECB seat has been empty since June 1. Mersch was
selected by European finance ministers in July and is awaiting a
parliament vote before taking office. The parliament’s next
opportunity is in the week of Oct. 22. EU President Herman Van Rompuy said in a letter to lawmakers released last week that no
member state put forward a female candidate for the ECB job.  Asmussen said there are “several very good bank
supervisors in  Europe ” and that the planned European bank
oversight plan will create “a good opportunity” to put more
women in top posts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
