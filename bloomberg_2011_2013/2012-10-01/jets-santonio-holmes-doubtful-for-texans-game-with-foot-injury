New York Jets wide receiver Santonio Holmes is doubtful to play next week and is awaiting further
medical results after injuring his foot yesterday in a 34-0 loss
to the San Francisco 49ers, Jets coach Rex Ryan said.  X-rays were negative and the team is having other tests
analyzed, Ryan said at a televised news conference from the
team’s training center in Florham Park, New Jersey. He declined
to speak specifically about the nature of the injury.  “He looks doubtful for this week, and after that we’re
unsure,” Ryan said.  The Jets, 2-2 after the loss to San Francisco, host the
undefeated Houston Texans Oct. 8 on ‘Monday Night Football.’  Holmes, 28, went down without contact after making a four-
yard reception during the third quarter yesterday. He fumbled
and the 49ers’ Carlos Rogers recovered the ball, returning it 51
yards for a score.  Holmes, in his third year in New York, leads the Jets with
20 catches for 272 yards this season, scoring one touchdown. He
caught 52 passes for 654 yards and eight scores in 2011.  The Jets last week lost All-Pro cornerback Darrelle Revis
to a torn knee ligament, probably for the season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
