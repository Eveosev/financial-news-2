Natural gas futures advanced to the
highest price in almost 10 months as forecasts for cooler
Midwest weather signaled higher demand for heating fuel.  Gas gained 4.8 percent as MDA EarthSat Weather in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted below-normal temperatures in
the central U.S. over the next six to 10 days. Heating demand
nationwide will be 78 percent above normal Oct. 7 through Oct.
11, data from Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri , show.  “It’s the first cold blast coming,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute
in New York. “It probably got rid of another layer of shorts in
the market.”  Natural gas for November delivery rose 16 cents to $3.48
per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest settlement price since Dec. 6. The futures
have jumped 24 percent from an intraday low of $2.814 a week ago
and are up 16 percent this year.  November $3 puts, bets that prices will fall, were the most
active gas options in electronic trading. They were down 2.2
cents to 2 cents on volume of 1,555 contracts at 3:332 p.m.  Fund started snapping up gas futures “significantly” last
week at around $3.10 and $3.20 in anticipation of winter and
extended those gains today on revised forecasts for October,
said John Woods, president of JJ Woods Associates and a Nymex
floor trader. “The rest of the month we are looking for cooler-
than-initially-anticipated weather. That’s good for a pop.”  CFTC Report  Money managers cut speculative bets on higher prices for a
ninth straight week, according to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s Commitments of Traders report on Sept. 28. Net-long
bets on four gas contracts declined 6,537 futures equivalents,
or 7.9 percent, to 76,177 in the week ended Sept. 25.  The measure includes an index of four contracts adjusted to
futures equivalents: Nymex natural gas futures, Nymex Henry Hub
Swaps, Nymex Henry Hub Penultimate Swaps and ICE Henry Hub
Swaps. Henry Hub, in Erath,  Louisiana , is the delivery point for
Nymex futures, a benchmark price for the fuel.  The low in  Chicago  on Oct. 10 may be 35 degrees Fahrenheit
(2 Celsius), 13 below normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. in
State College,  Pennsylvania .  Boston ’s low on Oct. 15 may fall to
10 below the usual reading at 37 degrees.  The heating season from November through March is the  peak
demand  period for U.S. gas consumption. Last winter was the
fourth-warmest on record in the lower 48 states, which crimped
demand for the fuel and bloated inventories.  Gas Demand  Gas has rallied since late August in anticipation of the
coming season, Mike Fitzpatrick, editor of the Energy OverView
newsletter in New York, wrote today. “But with fundamentals so
widely divergent from price, the rally can only be characterized
as based on hope and is very susceptible to correction,
particularly if a substantive hike in heating demand fails to
confirm price action fairly soon.”  U.S. stockpiles  totaled 3.576 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Sept. 21, 8.6 percent above the five-year average for
the period, the Energy Department said last week. The  surplus 
has declined from a six-year high of 61 percent at the end of
March as demand from electricity generators jumped because of
hotter-than-normal weather and fuel switching from coal.  A technical indicator that measures the magnitude of price
gains relative to declines is showing that gas may be
overbought. The relative strength index, or RSI, jumped to 72
today from 50 on Sept. 24, the highest since May 18. A number
above 70 is seen by some traders as a sell signal.  Price Outlook  Gas futures face a psychological resistance level at $3.50
and technical resistance at $3.57, said Tom Saal, senior vice
president of energy trading at INTL Hencorp Futures LLC in
Miami.  Woods says the gas rally may lose steam at around $3.63.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
500,666 as of 2:39 p.m., the most since Sept. 11, compared with
the three-month average of 369,000. Volume was 416,488 on Sept.
28. Open interest was 1.09 million contracts. The three-month
average is 1.11 million.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting full
volume and open interest data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
