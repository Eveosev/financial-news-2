Oil advanced to a one-week high as
U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly expanded and Spanish banks’
capital deficit dropped in September from June.  Futures rose 0.3 percent as the Institute for Supply
Management’s U.S. factory  index  increased to 51.5 in September
from 49.6 a month earlier, exceeding the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey. Spain’s banks have a capital deficit of 59.3
billion euros ($76.3 billion), a report commissioned by the
government showed, less than the 62 billion estimated in June.  “The ISM came in better than expected, which is certainly
helping the market,” said Kyle Cooper, director of commodities
research at IAF Advisors in Houston. “It wasn’t huge, but it
was above 50, which signals growth.”  Crude oil for November delivery rose 29 cents to $92.48 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement since Sept. 21. Prices, which are down 6.4 percent
this year, increased 8.5 percent in the third quarter.  Futures retreated from the intraday high of $93.33 as Brent
oil fell in  London  and gasoline futures in New York tumbled as
much as 1.1 percent.  Brent for November settlement decreased 20 cents to end the
session at $112.19 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange. The European benchmark grade’s premium to West
Texas Intermediate crude traded in New York was at $19.71, down
from a six-week closing high of $20.20 on Sept. 28.  Gasoline was steady as Brent, which reflects the price of
imported crudes used to make fuels on the East Coast, narrowed
its premium to WTI. November gasoline was unchanged at $2.9201 a
gallon on the Nymex. The scarcity of supply in New York Harbor
pushed the October contract up 19.77 cents, or 6.3 percent, on
Sept. 28, the day the contract expired.  Correlated Markets  “There are probably a lot of traders who think last week’s
rally was overdone and the squeeze in October futures left
futures overvalued,” said Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi
Futures Perspective in New York. “Brent and gasoline are
heavily correlated. It really doesn’t matter if it’s Brent
that’s dictating the direction or the other way around.”  The ISM report showed the first growth after three months
of contraction. Measures above 50 represent expansion.
Economists in a Bloomberg survey projected the Tempe, Arizona-
based ISM would report a reading of 49.7, according to the
median of 76 forecasts.  The euro advanced much as 0.6 percent against the dollar to
$1.2939. A stronger euro and weaker U.S. currency increase the
appeal of dollar-denominated raw materials as an investment. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities rose 0.2 percent.
The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  advanced 0.6 percent.  Debt Crisis  “It looks like the  European debt crisis  is coming closer
to an end,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, which oversees
$1.4 billion. “The commodities, and especially oil, are taking
their cue from the currency market.”  Spain’s banks capital deficit shrank by 2.7 billion euros
in September from a June estimate, stress tests conducted by New
York-based management consultancy Oliver Wyman showed Sept. 28.
The tests of 14 lenders were designed to lift doubts about the
financial industry’s ability to absorb losses. The tests are
part of the terms for Spain to win a European bailout of as much
as 100 billion euros of losses linked to souring real estate.  Europe’s debt crisis has reduced economic growth and the
continent’s energy consumption for three years. The crisis that
began in  Greece  has spread to Ireland,  Portugal ,  Italy , Spain
and Cyprus.  The U.S. and European Union used 32.3 million barrels a day
of oil in 2011, or 37 percent of the world’s total, according to
 BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy.  $120 Brent  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  said that Brent crude may advance to
$120 a barrel by the end of the year and raised its fourth-
quarter forecast for the oil benchmark by $6, citing stronger
prospects for the global economy.  Risks to world growth have been eased by stimulus measures
taken by central banks, analysts including Francisco Blanch in
New York and Sabine Schels in London said in a report. Bank of
America bolstered its fourth-quarter estimate for the grade to
$114 a barrel from $108.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 342,515
contracts as of 3:08 p.m. Volume totaled 360,459 contracts Sept.
28, the lowest level since May 25 and 32 percent below the
three-month average. Open interest was 1.55 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
