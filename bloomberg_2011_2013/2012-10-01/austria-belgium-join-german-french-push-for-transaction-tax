Austria  and Belgium have joined a
request from  France  and Germany to move forward on a financial-
transaction tax among a subset of European Union nations, EU
spokeswoman Emer Traynor said today.  The Brussels-based European Commission has received a
formal request from Austria and been notified that Belgium’s is
being prepared, said Traynor, a spokeswoman for EU Tax
Commissioner Algirdas Semeta. France and Germany sent a letter
to begin the process on Sept. 28.  Nine countries must sign on for the commission to begin
designing a transaction tax under the EU’s “enhanced
cooperation” procedures. In June, European Union finance
ministers cleared the way for a smaller group of countries to
proceed after it became evident there would not be unanimous
support for an agreement among all 27 countries in the bloc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
