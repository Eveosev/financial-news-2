The $6.5 trillion market for
investment-grade company bonds is the most attractive for risk-
averse fixed-income investors, according to  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)   Goldman Sachs, the fifth most-active underwriter of top-
tier corporate debt in the U.S., joins investors from BlackRock
Inc. to Loews Corp. in saying there’s still value in the bonds
even after the biggest rally in two years. The Federal Reserve
is suppressing yields on the debt with its plans to stimulate a
slowing economy, which include its expectation of keeping
interest rates near zero through mid-2015.  “We expect the search for yield to intensify,” analysts
led by  Charles Himmelberg  wrote in a Sept. 28 report. “Recent
central bank actions have reinvigorated the relative value case
for credit within fixed income.”  Investors funneled $2.1 billion into U.S. funds that buy
investment-grade debt last week while pulling $5 million from
those that focus on junk bonds, according to a Sept. 27 report
by  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  analysts. The best-rated company notes
gained 0.6 percent last week compared with a 0.6 decline in junk
bonds, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show.  “Investors will be forced to look elsewhere for
duration,” the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in the report. “To
satisfy this demand in liquid U.S. dollar markets, corporate
bonds would be the only realistic option.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
