Gold futures jumped to a 10-month
high after Federal  Reserve Bank  of  Chicago  President  Charles
Evans  said that the U.S. central bank can do more to boost the
economy, fueling concern that inflation will accelerate.  Evans, who doesn’t vote on Fed policy this year, said today
in an interview on CNBC that unemployment probably won’t fall to
7 percent until 2014. The central bank can “back off” of its
accommodation should inflation present a greater threat, he
said. In the third quarter, gold gained 11 percent, the most
since June 2010, as the Fed announced a third round of monetary
stimulus.  Demand for gold as a store of value surged amid speculation
that inflation will pick up after the Fed, the  Bank of Japan (8301)  and
the  European Central Bank  announced plans to buy more debt.
Holdings in exchange-traded  products  backed by the metal jumped
to a record on Sept. 25, while money managers and  hedge funds 
raised their bullish futures  bets  for the sixth straight week to
the highest since February, U.S. data showed on Sept. 28.  “People are hurrying up and buying gold as today’s
comments tell us that the Fed will continue with the stimulus
policies until its sees some improvement in economic
conditions,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “The inflation worries are back.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.5 percent to

reached a record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6, 2011, as Europe’s fiscal
woes escalated.  The metal soared 70 percent from the end of December 2008
to June 2011 as the Fed kept borrowing costs at a record low and
bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing. On Sept. 13, the central bank said it will
expand holdings of long-term securities with open-ended
purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt a month and keep the
benchmark  interest rate  near zero percent “at least through
mid-2015.”  Holdings in gold ETPs more than doubled since the end of
