Great Portland Estates Plc’s (GPOR)  venture
with Capital & Counties Plc plans to sell an office and
residential property near Regent’s Park in  London ’s West End
five months after divesting a building on the same street.  Great Capital Partnership will start marketing Park
Crescent West soon, according to Toby Courtauld, Great
Portland’s chief executive officer. The owners will seek more
than 100 million pounds ($162 million) for the property, a
person familiar with the matter said. He declined to be
identified because the information is private.  Park Crescent West has 129,500 square feet (12,000 square
meters) of space, Great Portland’s website shows. Great Capital
raised 47 million pounds from the sale of Park Crescent East on
the opposite side of the same street, the company said in May.  The venture agreed to sell two properties on London’s
Regent Street for 112.6 million pounds last month. Great Capital
was set up in 2007 and is expected to “wind down” before the
end of July 2013, Capital & Counties CEO Ian Hawksworth said in
July.  Capital & Counties declined to comment on the Park Crescent
West sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
