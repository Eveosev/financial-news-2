Serbia  and Bulgaria will build
natural gas pipeline, linking networks and improving  energy
security  for both countries that now have single supply routes.  Construction of the 180-kilometer (112 mile) pipe is to
begin next year and take 18 months to complete, at an estimated
cost of 100 million euros ($129 million) to 120 million euros,
Serbian Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic  told reporters in Belgrade
today. The European Union-supported, two-way pipeline will have
annual capacity of 2 billion cubic meters and the EU will
support Serbia’s 60-kilometer section with a 10 million-euro
donation, he said.  “We’ll sign a bilateral agreement with Bulgaria by the end
of next month, to be able to start construction next year,”
Dacic told reporters after meeting with Fabrizio Barbaso, the
European Commission’s deputy director general for energy.  The pipe will stretch from Nis, Serbia’s biggest southern
city, to Dupnitsa south of the Bulgarian capital Sofia, Dacic
said. Serbia’s only supply route comes from neighboring  Hungary 
and the new pipe will enable it to import gas via  Bulgaria ,
Dacic said.  “Bulgaria also has just one supply route at present but it
will be able to draw quantities” from Serbia, he said. Bulgaria
currently imports Russian gas through neighboring Romania.  “The interconnector project is of strategic importance,”
Barbaso said. “It’s urgent, the work has to begin next year”
after no progress has been made since a preliminary agreement on
the link in 2010, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
