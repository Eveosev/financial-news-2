Yields on two-year benchmark Turkish
debt rose to the highest level in almost a month after
electricity and natural gas price increases spurred expectations
that  inflation  will quicken.  The yield on two-year fixed income securities climbed four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.62 percent at 1
p.m. in Istanbul, marking the highest level since Sept. 4 on a
closing basis. The lira gained 0.1 percent to 1.7948 per dollar.  Electricity prices for households increased 9.8 percent and
for industry 4 percent, the energy market regulator said in an
e-mailed statement today. The government raised natural gas
prices by 9.8 percent as of Oct. 1, according to the state
Anatolia news agency.  “Worries that inflation will accelerate are causing sales
in the short-term debt because the market expectation for this
year’s inflation surpassed 7.5 percent,” Onur Bayol, a fixed-
income at  Denizbank AS (DENIZ)  in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments.  Inflation in September will accelerate to 9.2 percent from
8.9 percent in August, according to the  median estimate  of nine
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The Ankara-based statistics
office will release nationwide inflation data on Oct. 3.  The  one-year breakeven rate , a gauge of investor inflation
expectations that shows the yield premium for fixed-rate bonds
over debt linked to price increases, climbed to 8.4 percent, the
highest level since Dec. 8, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
