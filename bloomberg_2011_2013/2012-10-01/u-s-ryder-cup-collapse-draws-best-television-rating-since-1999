The Ryder Cup drew its best major- market television rating since 1999 as  Europe  matched the 13- year-old U.S. record for biggest comeback in the biannual golf competition, NBC said.  Europe’s 14 1/2 - 13 1/2 win over the U.S. yesterday at Medinah Country Club outside Chicago was seen in 4.1 percent of homes in the top 56 U.S. television markets, Adam Freifeld, a spokesman for  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC, said in an e-mail. That’s the best initial rating since the U.S. pulled off an equal comeback at the Country Club in Brookline,  Massachusetts . That broadcast drew a 6.3 rating.  Yesterday’s golf drew a 71 percent higher rating than the 2010 Ryder Cup, which Europe won at Celtic Manor in Wales. That event, which had a 4.1 rating on the equivalent Sunday, was concluded Monday because of rain.  Europe entered the Day 3 play yesterday trailing 10-6 with 12 singles matches remaining. They outscored the U.S. 8 1/2 to 3 1/2, meaning eight European golfers won their matches with one draw, to retain the title.
