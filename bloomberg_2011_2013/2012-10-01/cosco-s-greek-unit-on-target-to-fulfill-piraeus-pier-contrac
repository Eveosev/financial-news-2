Piraeus Port Authority SA (PPA) , which
operates Greece’s biggest port, said work by  Piraeus Container
Terminal SA , a unit of  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , to modernize Pier II
and build a third pier is proceeding on time.  “The projects are being carried out within the contractual
dates,” the authority said in an e-mailed statement today.  Cosco won in 2009 a contract to run container operations at
Pier II, which started in 2010, and to build Pier III. The two
facilities will have total container handling capacity of 3.7
million 20-foot equivalent units when the third pier is
operational. That’s scheduled for 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
