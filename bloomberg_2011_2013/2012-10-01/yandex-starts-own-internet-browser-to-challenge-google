Yandex NV (YNDX) , Russia’s largest Internet
search engine, is starting its own Web-browser to challenge
 Google Inc. (GOOG)  and prevent a decline in market share.  The brower can be downloaded from 5 p.m. Moscow time today
and will get updated “every several weeks,” Chief Executive
Officer  Arkady Volozh  said in Moscow today. The browser, based
on the WebKit platform and Google’s Chromium open code, will use
software from Kaspersky Lab to test for viruses and  Opera
Software ASA (OPERA) ’s Turbo technology to download pages faster.  The browser may help Yandex to defend its market share. The
company’s share of Russian Internet searches dropped to 60.6
percent last month from a peak of 65 percent in February 2011.
In the same period, the search share of Google rose to 26.6
percent from 21.4 percent as the share of its Chrome browser
surged to 25.9 percent from 9.6 percent.  In Russia,  Europe ’s largest Internet market by the number
of users, Opera is the most popular browser with 30 percent
market share, while Mozilla’s Firefox and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s
Internet Explorer account for about 19 and 14 percent
respectively, according to researcher LiveInternet.ru. Apple’s
Safari accounts for 9 percent.  Yandex wants its new browser to reach significant market
share and “stand in one row” with the main competitors, Tigran
Khudaverdyan, head of mobile services at Yandex, said in an
interview.  The program could become the default browser on some mobile
handsets, depending on future partnerships with manufacturers,
Khudaverdyan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
