Crude oil options volatility advanced
for the first time in three days as U.S. manufacturing beat
analyst estimates, lifting the underlying futures to the highest
level in a week.  Implied volatility for options expiring in November, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 28.4 percent as of 4:15 p.m. in New York,
compared with 27.9 percent on Sept. 28.  Crude oil for November delivery gained 29 cents to $92.48 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Sept. 21, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  Institute for Supply Management â€™s U.S. factory
 index  increased to 51.5 in September from 49.6 a month earlier
and higher than the 49.7 median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
November $90 puts, bets that prices would decline, which fell 22
cent to $1.23 a barrel at 4:38 p.m. with 990 lots trading.
December $125 calls were the second-most active, with 910 lots
changing hands as they were unchanged at 13 cents a barrel.  Calls accounted for 52 percent of the 28,006 contracts in
electronic trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, calls made up 57 percent of the
122,473 contracts traded.  December $125 calls were the most actively traded options,
with 9,898 lots changing hands. They were unchanged at 13 cents
a barrel. December $120 calls were unchanged at 17 cents with a
volume of 9,146.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
47,169 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 45,105 lots
and December $100 calls with 43,609.  To contact the reporter on this story:
