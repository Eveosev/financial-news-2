Swiss  manufacturing  output contracted
more than economists forecast in September, suggesting the
economy will struggle to regain strength.  The procure.ch  Purchasing Managers â€™ Index fell to 43.6 from
46.7 in August, when adjusted for seasonal swings,  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)  said today in an e-mailed statement from Zurich. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction. Economists forecast a
gain to 47.5, the median of 11 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
