The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
climb to a record 1,585 next year as economic growth improves
amid stimulus efforts by global central banks, said John Stoltzfus, Oppenheimer & Co.’s chief investment strategist.  The strategist’s forecast implies a 10 percent rally in the
 S&P 500  from the Sept. 28 close of 1,440.67. The advance would
take the index above its all-time high of 1,565.15 reached on
Oct. 9, 2007. The gauge trades at 14.8 times  reported earnings ,
up from a price-to-earnings ratio of 12.9 on June 1.  “We expect the process of fostering an economic recovery
from the grips of a global financial crisis will persist and
ultimately prove successful,” Stoltzfus wrote in a report
today. “Multiple expansion across sectors will lead to
increased price levels even as corporate earnings growth may
rise at a slower pace.”  Wall Street strategists so far are unanimous in predicting
the S&P 500 will reach a record next year, according to the four
firms that have made predictions out of 14 tracked by Bloomberg.
Stoltzfus’ estimate is higher than the 1,575 level called for by
 Bank of Montreal (BMO) ’s Brian Belski while lower than predictions of
1,600 by Bank of America Corp.’s Savita Subramanian and 1,615 by
Tobias Levkovich at Citigroup Inc.  S&P 500 companies will earn $108 a share in 2013, Stoltzfus
said. That compares with the average analyst  earnings estimate 
of $115.38 a share, down more than 2 percent in the past four
months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The S&P 500 rallied 2.4 percent last month, touching the
highest level since 2007 and bringing its 2012 advance to 15
percent, as central banks in the U.S.,  Europe  and  Japan  took
action to spur growth. The American equity benchmark needs to
increase 8.6 percent from last week’s close to reach its all-
time high.  The S&P 500 may drop 2 percent to end this year at 1,412,
according to the average forecast of 14 Wall Street strategists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Oppenheimer has a 1,450 target on the
 stock index  for 2012.  Stoltzfus, formerly at Ticonderoga Securities LLC, replaced
 Brian Belski  as New York-based Oppenheimer’s chief strategist in
May this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
