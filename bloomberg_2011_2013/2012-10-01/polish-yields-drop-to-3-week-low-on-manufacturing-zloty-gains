Yields on Polish two-year notes fell
to an almost three-week low and the zloty advanced as a report
showing manufacturing worsened for a sixth month in September,
bolstering expectations for an  interest-rate  cut this week.  The yield on notes maturing in July 2014 fell three basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.02 percent as of 5:23
p.m. in Warsaw, the lowest since Sept. 11. The zloty advanced
0.5 percent to 4.0956 per euro, the steepest gain among more
than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The purchasing managers’ index, a gauge of manufacturing,
fell to 47 from 48.3 in August, signaling goods production
declined at the fastest rate since June 2009, HSBC Holdings Plc
said today.  Poland ’s central bank will cut the main interest
rate a quarter point to 4.5 percent on Oct. 3 to spur economic
growth, according to 25 out of 33 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. The other eight expected no change in borrowing costs.  The data show “Polish policy makers are clearly behind the
curve when it comes to interest rate cuts,” Adam Antonik, an
economist at  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  in Warsaw, wrote in an e-mailed
research note. “We expect them to reduce rates” this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
