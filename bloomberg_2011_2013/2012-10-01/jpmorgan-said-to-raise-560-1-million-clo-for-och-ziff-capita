JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  raised a $560.1
million collateralized loan obligation for Och-Ziff Capital
Management Group, according to two people with knowledge of the
deal.  The fund includes a $336.5 million slice rated AAA that
pays a rate of 148 basis points more than the London interbank
offered rate, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the terms havenâ€™t been announced publicly. Libor is the
rate at which banks say they can borrow in dollars from each
other.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  The bank raised a $510.7 million CLO for the firm in June,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Elizabeth Seymour, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, and Jonathan
Gasthalter, a spokesman for Och-Ziff, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
