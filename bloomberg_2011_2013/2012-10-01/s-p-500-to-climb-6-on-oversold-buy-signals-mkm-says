The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  may
climb more than 6 percent after last week’s retreat triggered
widespread “oversold buy signals,” according to a technical
analyst at MKM Partners LLC.  The U.S. equities gauge will rebound to 1,530 after last
week’s 1.3 percent decline,  Katie Stockton , chief market
technician at MKM in Stamford,  Connecticut , wrote in a report
dated yesterday.  Equities fell last week on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is
worsening and stimulus measures may not be enough to boost
economic growth. The S&P 500 still climbed 2.4 percent in
September for the fourth straight monthly gain, and ended the
third quarter with a 5.8 percent advance. The index closed at
1,440.67 on Sept. 28.  “We expect the S&P 500 to see its daily  stochastics  turn
up from oversold territory this week and would be adding
exposure to cyclical sectors in anticipation of an oversold
bounce,” Stockton wrote. “The uptrend still has positive
short- and intermediate-term momentum, based on the 20-, 35- and
50-day moving averages and the weekly MACD indicator.”  Stochastics, a technical analysis tool based on momentum
measures, are often used to identify whether a security is
overbought or oversold. MACD refers to moving average
convergence-divergence, which tracks the difference between
moving averages of various durations.  Stockton said the 1,530 level was indicated by “the
breakout earlier this month.” The  S&P 500  rose to a 4 1/2-year
high of 1,465.77 on Sept. 14.  A “more significant” correction is likely around the U.S.
earnings season, with initial support for the S&P 500 near
1,420, the analyst wrote. Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S. aluminum
producer, will be the first company in the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average (INDU)  to report results for the last quarter on Oct. 9.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
