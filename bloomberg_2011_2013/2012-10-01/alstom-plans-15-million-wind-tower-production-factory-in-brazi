Alstom SA (ALO) , Europe’s second-largest
power-equipment maker, will build a 30 million-real ($14.8
million) factory in Brazil’s southern state of Rio Grande do Sul
that will make towers for wind farms.  The facility, planned for the city of Canoas, will have
capacity to produce 120 towers a year and is expected to start
operating in the first half of next year, Levallois-Perret,
France-based Alstom said today in an e-mailed statement.  It will furnish towers for local construction company
Odebrecht SA’s Corredor do Senandes wind project in the same
state as well as other Latin American wind farms, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
