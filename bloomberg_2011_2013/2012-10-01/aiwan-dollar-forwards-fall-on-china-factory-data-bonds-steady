Taiwan dollar forwards weakened for
the first time in three days on concern a pickup in the island’s
growth is unlikely as a report showed Chinese factory output
trailed economists’ forecasts.  Government bonds  were steady.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index in  Asia ’s largest economy
was 49.8 in September, less than the median estimate of 50.1 in
a Bloomberg News survey, official data showed today. Taiwan’s
export orders dropped 1.5 percent in August from a year earlier,
a sixth monthly decline, according to a Sept. 20 report.  “It looks like one of the world’s biggest growth engines
is in trouble,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First
Securities Inc. in Taipei. “Global economic growth might
struggle to recover anytime soon.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.1 percent to
NT$29.315 as of 4:20 p.m. in Taipei, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. They traded at a 0.3 premium to the spot rate.  The  Taiwan dollar  weakened 0.2 percent to NT$29.402 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It reached
NT$29.198 on Sept. 17, the strongest level since May 3. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options was unchanged at 3.71 percent.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.125 percent bonds due September
2022 was 1.168 percent, compared with 1.169 percent on Sept. 28,
according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight money-
market rate  advanced one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 0.391 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
