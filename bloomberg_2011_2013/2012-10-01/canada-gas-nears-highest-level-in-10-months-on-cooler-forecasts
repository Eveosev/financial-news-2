Canadian natural gas rose to the
highest price in almost 10 months as forecasters shifted their
outlooks toward cooler weather.  November  gas in  Alberta  jumped as much as 5.2 percent to
its highest price since Dec. 8 as temperatures in the central
U.S. will be 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 to 2.7 degrees
Celsius) below normal during the first half October, according
to MDA Earthsat Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  “The forecast for the first half of October cooled
substantially since Friday,” with much-below normal
temperatures centered over the midcontinent in the six- to 10-
day period, MDA forecaster  Bob Haas  wrote in a note to clients.  MDA said temperatures will reach at least 10 degrees below
the seasonal average in many cities in the central U.S. this
weekend. Chicago’s lows on Oct. 7 will drop to 34 degrees
Fahrenheit, 12 degrees below average.  Alberta gas for November delivery rose 11.25 cents or 3.9
percent to C$2.9725 per gigajoule (US$2.87 per million British
thermal units) as of 2:15 p.m.  New York  time on the NGX, a
Canadian electronic exchange.  Natural gas for November delivery on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  rose 16 cents, or 4.8 percent, to settle at
$3.48 per million Btu.  Canadian gas prices have risen 55 percent from C$1.915 on
Aug. 28, as shrinking surpluses helped ease concern that a glut
of would fill available storage.  Price Gains  The continued rise in natural gas prices is partly driven
by momentum and a recent shift in the broader market from bonds
toward riskier assets such as commodities, said  Tim Evans , an
energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York.  Net Canadian gas exports to the U.S. averaged 5.78 billion
cubic feet a day in the seven days ended Sept. 27, up from 5.73
billion a year earlier, according to LCI Energy Insight, an El
Paso, Texas, energy advisory firm.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output from most of Canada’s gas wells, was 15.47 billion cubic
feet at 1:30 p.m. New York time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.38 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main Line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.08 billion cubic feet.  Capacity on TransCanada’s  British Columbia system  at
Kingsgate was oversubscribed by 241 million cubic feet. The
system was forecast to carry 1.91 billion cubic feet today.
Estimated capacity was 1.67 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy Corp.’s  British Columbia
system, which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia
for delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.6
billion cubic feet at 1:20 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
