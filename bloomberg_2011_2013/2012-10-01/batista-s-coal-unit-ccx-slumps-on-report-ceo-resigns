CCX Carvao da Colombia SA , the coal
company controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , fell
to a record low after a magazine columnist reported its chief
executive officer resigned. The company denied the report.  The  shares  dropped 5.2 percent to 2.92 reais at the close
in Sao Paulo, the lowest since it began trading in May. The Rio
de Janeiro-based company, which develops mining projects in
Colombia, was the worst performer today on the Bovespa Small Cap
 index .  EBX Group Co., the holding company for most of Batista’s
assets, denied a report that CEO Leonardo Moretzsohn had
resigned, according to an e-mailed statement today. Lauro
Jardim, a columnist for Brazilian magazine Veja,  reported  the
resignation on his blog today, without saying how he obtained
the information.  The possible exit of CCX’s CEO brings further instability
to the stock after a recent drop, said Aloisio Lemos, a Rio-
based analyst at brokerage Agora Corretora.  “CCX is a project in a very initial stage,” he said in a
phone interview. “That possible change of executives brings in
additional tension for the stock.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
