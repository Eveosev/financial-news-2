Orascom Development Holding AG (ODHN)  said
it expects more tourists at its Taba,  Egypt  hotels after the
country reopened a port linking it with Jordan, signaling
security in the  Sinai Peninsula  may be improving.  The port was closed at the start of the January 2011 revolt
that led to the ouster of  Hosni Mubarak . The occupancy rate at
Orascom’s Taba hotels fell to 43 percent in the first half of
this year from 49 percent a year earlier and 73 percent in the
first six months of 2010, Sara El Gawahergy, the Altdorf,
Switzerland-based company’s investor relations manager, said in
a telephone interview today.  “The decision to reopen the port was in close cooperation
with local government authorities as perceived security concerns
in North Sinai seem less pronounced,” El Gawahergy said. “We
expect the reopening to boost tourism and have a positive impact
on Taba Heights,” an Orascom-run hotel.  Violence has flared in Sinai, which lies on Egypt’s border
with Israel, in recent months with troops from both countries
targeted by militants. An Israeli soldier and three gunmen were
killed in a Sept. 21 firefight on  Israel ’s side of the border,
and an attack the previous month left 16 Egyptian border guards
dead and prompted the country’s military to start an operation
against extremist groups in the territory.  Egypt’s government aims to increase tourist arrivals to 30
million by 2017, the state-run  al-Ahram  reported on Sept. 27.
Last month, the government approved foreign ownership of real
estate in Sinai to encourage investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
