     Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- MetLife Inc., the insurer seeking an
exit from banking to limit U.S. oversight, said it won an
extension for submitting its capital plan to the  Federal Reserve 
as the company seeks regulatory approval for a deal to sell
deposits to  General Electric Co. (GE)   The deadline was moved to Jan. 5 from Sept. 30, according
to a regulatory filing today from New York-based MetLife, the
largest U.S. life insurer.  The extension is the second granted to Chief Executive
Officer  Steven Kandarian  after he was unable to get out of
banking as quickly as he planned. The Fed, which regulates the
largest banks and previously rejected Kandarian’s proposal to
resume share buybacks, had initially sought a new capital plan
by June, before it set the Sept. 30 date.  “We continue to believe the Federal Reserve has
little interest in regulating MET as a bank holding company,”
Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. analysts led by  John Nadel  said in a
Sept. 24 note. “Why otherwise would the Fed have granted MET
the original refilling extension?”  MetLife said Sept. 21 that it changed the GE deal so that
it would require approval from the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency rather than the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
