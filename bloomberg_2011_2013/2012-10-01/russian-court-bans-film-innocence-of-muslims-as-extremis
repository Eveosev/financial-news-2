A Moscow district court outlawed an
anti-Islamic film that has provoked violent protests across the
Muslim world after labeling it “extremist.”  Moscow prosecutors asked the court to ban the “Innocence
of Muslims” film because it aims to create a perception that
Islam and Muslims are inferior, according to an e-mailed
statement from General Prosecutor’s Office today.  The court order means distribution of the video will be
banned in Russia. OAO  Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) ,  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  and OAO
MegaFon have already blocked access to the film after a request
by the Prosecutor General’s Office last month.  The low-budget movie includes a fictional attack by Muslims
on a Christian family, followed by an account of the origins of
Islam depicting the Prophet Muhammad as a womanizer. The film,
which the U.S. has described as “very offensive,” last month
triggered violent demonstrations and attacks on U.S. and
European targets in several Muslim countries.  U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three colleagues
were killed in an attack in Benghazi, while Muslim protesters in
Tunis and elsewhere died in clashes with government security
forces.  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube blocked access to the clip in
 Egypt  and Libya following attacks on the U.S. missions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
