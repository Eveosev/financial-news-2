The euro may fall to a three-week low
against the dollar after dropping below its 200-day moving
average today, ING Groep NV said, citing trading patterns.  The 17-nation currency is poised to extend losses to $1.27
within the next two weeks as it approaches its 50-day moving
average at $1.2581, Roelof-Jan Van den Akker, a technical
analyst in Amsterdam, wrote today in a note to clients.  “The weakening trend is still intact and it is quite
normal to see a hesitation around the 200-day moving average,”
Van den Akker said in an interview, confirming the contents of
the report. “We expect more selling pressure on the euro.”  The euro gained 0.2 percent to $1.2888 at 12:52 p.m. London
time after falling as much as 0.4 percent to $1.2804, below the
200-day moving average at $1.2824. The last time the single
currency traded at $1.27 was on Sept. 7.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
