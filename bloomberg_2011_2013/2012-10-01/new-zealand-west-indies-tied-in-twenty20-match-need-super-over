New Zealand  and West Indies tied on
139 runs after their innings and will move to a ‘super over’ to
decide their final eight match at cricket’s World Twenty20 in
 Sri Lanka .  Sunil Narine was 3-20, helping restrict the Kiwis, but his
misfield of a shot in the final over allowed  Ross Taylor  to
score an extra run and retain the strike. Taylor’s 62 runs led
New Zealand to 139-7 at the end of its 20 overs.  New Zealand won the toss and elected to field. West Indies
was all out for 139 runs, led by Chris Gayle’s 30, with
three balls remaining in its 20 overs in Pallekelle.  The losing side will be eliminated from the tournament.  Defending champion England plays host Sri Lanka in the
other Group 1 match today. The top two teams in each group
advance to the semifinals.  The World Twenty20, generally held every two years, is the
