Serbia may be hit by diesel shortages
as four barges with fuel belonging to  Naftna Industrija Srbije
AD (NIIS) , majority-owned by  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) , remain stuck in the
Danube where workers are blocking the river over unpaid wages.  While NIS is currently “analyzing” alternative supply
routes, it may be “forced to limit diesel supplies both for its
own filling stations and its clients if the river blockade
continues,” the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  The four barges are carrying about 4,000 tons of  diesel
fuel  and are prevented from reaching filling stations across
Serbia as workers of the Novi Sad-based  Dunav Grupa Agregati AD 
protest over what they claim are overdue wages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
