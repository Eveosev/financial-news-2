Slovak Premier  Robert Fico  said the
euro area may break up and lose one or two members, Sme  reported 
on its website.  Fico, in a debate on TV Markiza, said he sees a 50 percent
chance the bloc will remain intact, according to Sme. Greece
currently doesnâ€™t meet its bailout commitments and if that
continues it should leave the common currency, Fico was cited by
Sme as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
