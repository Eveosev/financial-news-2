Carlsberg A/S (CARLB) , the world’s fourth-
largest brewer, snapped a six-day losing streak in Copenhagen,
rising on bets its Thai partnership with Singha Corp. will add
value to the stock.  Carlsberg rose as much as 1.9 percent, ending the longest
losing streak since the end of March. The stock rose 1.4 percent
to 521 kroner at 2:32 p.m. in the Danish capital.  Carlsberg said Sept. 28 it’s teaming up with Singha to
distribute market and sell its brands in the  Thailand , one of
the few Southeast Asian countries where the Copenhagen-based
brewer has a negligible presence. Nordea Bank AB praised the
deal today and said Carlsberg is “the most attractive” of the
world’s biggest brewery shares.  “The deal gives Carlsberg a good foothold in the Thai
market and fits with the company’s strategy to exploit growth
options in the Asian markets,” Mikkel Petersen, a senior equity
adviser at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen, said in the note. “If
Carlsberg plays its cards right in  Asia , the shares may have
additional growth potential.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
