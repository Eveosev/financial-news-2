Somalia  deployed government soldiers
in the center of the port city of Kismayo, three days after
African Union forces captured the stronghold of al-Qaeda-backed
Islamist militants, an eyewitness said.  “Armed government forces together with armored vehicles
have been seen in the city,” Ibrahim Abdi Sheikh, a businessman
in Kismayo, said in a phone interview today. General Ismail
Sahardiid, the general commander of Somali forces in the
southern Juba region, didn’t answer his mobile phone when called
for comment today.  African forces seized Kismayo on Sept. 28 in what Kenyan
President Mwai Kibaki said marked a turning point in the war
against Islamist militants who have been seeking the ouster of
Somalia’s United Nations-backed government since at least 2006.
Kenyan forces entered Somalia last year following attacks on
tourists and aid workers in  Kenya  and are now fighting under an
African Union mandate.  Kismayo was a strategic target because it’s been a key
supply route for al-Shabaab, an affiliate of al-Qaeda, and a
source of taxes the group collects, according to the UN. Income
from Somali ports has generated as much as $50 million a year
for al-Shabaab from illegal trading, the UN Monitoring Group on
Somalia said in a report last year.  African Union forces haven’t been deployed in Kismayo yet,
Colonel Ali Hamud Aden, a spokesman for the African Union
Mission in Somalia, said by phone today from Mogadishu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
