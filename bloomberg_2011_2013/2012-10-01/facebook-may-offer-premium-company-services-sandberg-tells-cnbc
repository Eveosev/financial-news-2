Facebook Inc. (FB)  is considering offering
premium services for companies that have pages on its site, a
potential new revenue stream for the world’s most popular social
network, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said on CNBC.  Premium options, which would be added to free features that
now let businesses and groups create and manage pages for fans
on Facebook’s site, may include analytics, support services and
other functions, said Brandon McCormick, a spokesman for
Facebook, after Sandberg’s interview on CNBC today.  The company is rolling out products “aggressively,”
Sandberg said, and a new version of Facebook’s mobile
application, unveiled in August for users of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
iPhone, is “boosting engagement” with users. Mobile is a
“huge opportunity,” she said.  The company, whose stock has plunged more than 40 percent
since its initial public offering in May, has been facing
investor questions about its ability to make money from its more
than 950 million users. The company, which gets most of its
revenue from advertising, in July said sales growth slowed to 32
percent in the second quarter after rising 45 percent in the
prior period.  Still, Facebook is “more valuable” than when the company
held its IPO, Sandberg said on CNBC.  Facebook, based in Menlo Park,  California ,  rose  1.5 percent
to $21.99 at 2:02 p.m. in New York. The company sold shares to
the public at $38 apiece on May 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
