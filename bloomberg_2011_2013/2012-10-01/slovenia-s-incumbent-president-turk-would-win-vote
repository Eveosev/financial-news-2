Slovenian President Danilo Turk would
win reelection if it were held this weekend, a poll shows.  Turk would get the support of 36 percent of those polled,
followed by Borut Pahor, a former prime minister with 20 percent
backing, a survey by Delo Stik polling agency of the Ljubljana-
based newspaper  said  today. The survey was carried out Sept.
26-27 among 500 people. No margin of error was given.  Milan Zver, a member of the European Parliament and the
candidate for the ruling Slovenian Democratic Party, would place
third with 9 percent, according to the poll.  Slovenians will vote Nov. 11 to choose the fourth president
since the nation became independent from  Yugoslavia  in 1991. A
second round of voting would follow if no candidate gets a 50
percent majority in the first round.  The president of Slovenia serves a five-year term in a
largely ceremonial role.  To contact the reporter on this story:
