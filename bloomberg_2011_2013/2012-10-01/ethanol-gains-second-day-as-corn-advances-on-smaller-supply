Ethanol futures rose for a second day
in  Chicago  as corn advanced.  The biofuel gained after a Sept. 28 Agriculture Department
report said inventories at the start of the month totaled 988
million bushels, down 12 percent from a year earlier and the
lowest level since 2004. One bushel of corn makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  “It’s like scratching a chalkboard trying to get corn from
the farmers,” said  Chris Wilson , an analyst at Atten Babler
Risk Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois . “Guys are still having
trouble procuring corn. Day-to-day it’s still correlated to the
corn price.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery climbed 0.1 cent to
settle at $2.345 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest price since Sept. 14. The futures have jumped 6.5
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  advanced 5.5
cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.45 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive increased 4.5 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.36, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Ethanol on the West Coast added 3 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$2.485 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel rose 1.5 cents
to $2.42.  Corn for December delivery gained 0.5 cent to $7.5675 a
bushel in Chicago.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, plants
are losing about 40 cents on each gallon of the biofuel
produced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t
include profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  Abengoa SA (ABG) , a Spanish engineering and renewable energy
company, will temporarily idle its Madison, Illinois, ethanol
plant for maintenance and because of poor production margins,
Christopher Standlee, a spokesman for the company said today in
a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
