Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski will lay a wreath tomorrow at the site of a plane
crash in  Russia  that killed his predecessor, as the nations
bicker over a plaque marking the anniversary of the disaster.  Lech Kaczynski and other leading Polish government and
military officials were killed when their plane came down while
they were on their way to commemorate the murder of 22,000
Polish officers and officials by the Soviet secret police at
Katyn in 1940.  In January, a report in Moscow said the pilots had been
under “psychological pressure” to land in dense fog when they
crashed, sparking tensions between the countries.  A Polish plaque marking the crash site that mentioned the
Katyn massacre as well as the plane crash was removed by Russian
officials. A new plaque refers to the plane crash alone. The
Russian Foreign Ministry expressed its “perplexity” over
Polish protests, saying its counterparts had been informed that
any plaque required prior approval.  Russia’s President  Dmitry Medvedev  is scheduled to join
Komorowski at the wreath-laying ceremony.  To contact the reporter on this story:
