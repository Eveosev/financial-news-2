Svetlana Chestnykh spends her days
in the state or museum archives of  St. Petersburg , Russia,
poring over bills, newspapers, letters and photographs from the
czarist era.  Documentation she found helped boost the price of a Faberge
parasol knob to $80,500 at  Sotheby’s (BID)  New York last November.
Bills she dug up showed the gem-set object was purchased by
Emperor Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Fedorovna for 185
rubles on Oct. 28, 1897.  “If it didn’t have the imperial connection, it probably
would have stayed within the estimate” of $15,000 to $20,000,
said  Karen Kettering , Sotheby’s vice president for Russian art.  Sotheby’s catalog acknowledges Chestnykh’s help with its
cover lot in tomorrow’s Russian art sale: an elaborate micro-
mosaic table made by  Italy ’s Barberi workshop for the Russian
court in the early 1830s. It has a presale estimate of $400,000
to $600,000.  Resting on a pedestal shaped like three double-headed
eagles, the tabletop has hundreds of thousands of tiny pieces of
colored glass arranged to depict a battle between Russian and
Turkish soldiers.  “I dedicated more than a year to this table,” said
Chestnykh, 41, in an interview in New York last week. “It’s
like my baby. You sit on your bum and read, read and read.”  Complicated Ties  The research led her to  Russia ’s Prince Anatole Demidoff,
the heir to an industrialist family who lived in Italy and
commissioned the table from Barberi, a famous company patronized
by Nicholas I.  “Demidoff had a complicated relationship with the czar and
most likely intended this table as a gift for him,” Chestnykh
said.  Research often takes years, yet occasionally she gets
lucky. She spent less than two months locating a file related to
two sets of early-20th-century skis and a pair of leather boots
that belonged to Czarevitch Alexei and are offered tomorrow at
Sotheby’s with a presale estimate of $60,000 to $80,000.  The items were a gift from the Moscow Ski Club to the
czarevitch in 1910. The group petitioned the Imperial Court for
permission to present the skiing equipment to the 6-year-old
Alexei and request that he become a patron of the organization.
Czarevitch Alexei was killed with the rest of his family by the
Bolsheviks in 1918.  “The archivist told me that I was the first person who
requested this file in 50 years,” said Chestnykh, whose name
means “honest” in Russian.  Value of Provenance  What is imperial provenance worth?  “Depending on what the object is, it can easily double or
triple in value,” said Mark Moehrke, Christie’s director of
Russian art.  Last November, Christie’s sold a Faberge brooch decorated
with a diamond lily-of-the-valley for 32,450 pounds ($53,059),
up from the presale estimate of 10,000 pounds to 15,000 pounds.
It was a gift from Empress Alexandra Fedorovna to Baroness
Ungern-Sternberg in June 1898.  “Having a good object is one thing,” Chestnykh said.
“But history gives the same object the wings.”  To contact the reporter of this story:
