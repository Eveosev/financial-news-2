AC Milan won 2-1 at Fiorentina to
maintain its three-point lead over Napoli atop Italian soccer’s
Serie A.  Goals from Clarence Seedorf and Alexandre Pato secured
Milan’s win last night after Napoli had earlier drawn level on
points with a 2-0 victory over Bologna. Giuseppe Mascara and
Marek Hamsik got Napoli’s goals in the first half.  AC Milan, seeking its first league title since 2004, has 68
points with six games remaining. Defending champion Inter Milan,
a 2-0 winner over Chievo two days ago, has 63 points.  In  Spain , Real Madrid won 3-1 at Athletic Bilbao two days
ago to stay eight points behind leader Barcelona, which had a 3-
1 home win over Almeria. Valencia routed Villarreal 5-0 last
night to move six points ahead of its opponent in third place.  Bayer Leverkusen  narrowed the gap on German Bundesliga
leader  Borussia Dortmund  to five points with a 2-1 win over St.
Pauli. Dortmund drew 1-1 at Hamburg two days ago thanks to an
injury-time goal by Jakub Blaszczykowski.  Defending champion  Bayern Munich  fired coach Louis van Gaal
yesterday and appointed his assistant, Andries Jonker, as
caretaker coach. Van Gaal was due to leave the club at the end
of the season, when Jupp Heynckes will take over.  In  France , Marseille trails leader Lille by three points
after a 2-2 draw with Toulouse yesterday. Defending champion
Lyon moved up to third place by beating Lens 3-0 last night.  In the  Netherlands , FC Twente keeps a two-point lead over
PSV Eindhoven after both teams drew yesterday.  WEEKEND RESULTS
