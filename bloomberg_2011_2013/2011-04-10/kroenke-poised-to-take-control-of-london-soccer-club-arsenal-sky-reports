U.S. billionaire Stan Kroenke is
poised to take control of Arsenal  soccer club , Sky News said on
its website.  Kroenke, who owns close to 30 percent of the Premier League
team, is in advanced talks to acquire the 16 percent stakes held
by Danny Fiszman and Nina Bracewell-Smith, Sky said without
saying where it got the information.  An announcement could be made tomorrow although it may be
delayed, Sky added. If Kroenke secures both holdings, he would
take his stake to about 62 percent of the club. A holding of 30
percent or more triggers a mandatory takeover bid under Stock
Exchange rules.  Arsenal’s second-biggest shareholder is Russian billionaire
 Alisher Usmanov , with more than 27 percent. Unlike Kroenke, he
does not have a seat on the board.  Kroenke spokesman Tomago Collins, Bracewell-Smith, Arsenal
spokesman Dan Tolhurst and Usmanov spokesman Rollo Head didn’t
immediately respond to calls or e-mails seeking comment.  Smithfield Group, which issues statements on behalf of
Fiszman, didn’t pick up a call outside business hours.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
