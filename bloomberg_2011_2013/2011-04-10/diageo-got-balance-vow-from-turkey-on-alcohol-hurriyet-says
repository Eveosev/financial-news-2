Turkish spirits producer Mey Icki for about $2.1 billion in
February, received a pledge from the Turkish government that
there will be a “balanced” approach to the alcoholic drinks
industry, Hurriyet newspaper said citing Andrew Morgan, Diageo’s
president of European operations.  Government ministers assured Diageo that there won’t be
problems in the industry in the future, Morgan told Hurriyet.
