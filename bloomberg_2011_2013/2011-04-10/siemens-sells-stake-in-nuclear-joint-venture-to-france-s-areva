Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Germany ’s largest
engineering company, sold its 34 percent stake in the Areva NP
nuclear-power joint venture to France’s  Areva SA. (CEI)   “We are not an owner anymore and Areva paid us the money
in the month of March,” Constantin Birnstiel, a spokesman for
Munich, Germany-based Siemens, said by telephone today. He
couldn’t comment on the sale price, because of an arbitration
procedure that may lower or increase the value of the stake.  Die Welt  newspaper earlier reported that Siemens sold its
holding in the joint venture to Areva for 1.62 billion euros
($2.34 billion). Siemens said on March 15 that its stake in the
joint venture had been valued at 1.62 billion euros by an
independent expert, a fifth less than estimated in 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
