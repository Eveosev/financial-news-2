HMV Plc, the U.K. retailer of
books, music and DVDs, postponed a rights offer because of
shareholder hostility to the plan, the Observer reported, citing
advisers to the company and unidentified investors.  The retailer faces a boycott by investors to an additional
share sale after it lowered its forecast for pretax profit for
the third time last week, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
