Australia ’s recent natural
disasters, a strong local currency and consumers cautious about
spending are “weighing heavily on government revenues,”
Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said.  These factors have cut tax receipts by about A$4.5 billion
($4.75 billion) over the first eight months of the financial
year, compared with the government’s forecast, Swan wrote in his
weekly e-mailed economic note.  While the 4.9 percent unemployment rate in March is a
“terrific achievement,” the economy still has “soft
patches,” and needs reforms to boost competitiveness, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
