The leader of the youth wing of
 South Africa ’s ruling  African National Congress  said land taken
from blacks since 1913 should be seized from whites without
compensation, City Press  reported  today.  The ANC’s land distribution policy has failed,  Julius
Malema  said. “Targets were set but not met,” he was quoted as
saying. Malema was addressing the  South African Jewish Students
Union  in Cape Town on April 8, the newspaper said.  Malema also criticized Chinese business dealings in  Africa ,
according to the newspaper. He said the Chinese were worse than
previous colonial occupiers as they plundered the continent’s
resources without offering employment to local people, City
Press reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
