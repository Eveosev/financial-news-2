Iran  expelled three Kuwaiti
diplomats “in retaliation” for  Kuwait ’s decision to kick out
Iranian envoys, state-run  Press TV  reported.  Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed Al-Sabah said on
March 31 that several Iranian diplomats were “persona non grata
and must be expelled.” Press TV said three Iranian diplomats
were expelled on April 2.  The move came after a Kuwaiti court sentenced two Iranians
and a Kuwaiti to death for involvement in a spy ring and
“proved this cell’s direct links to Iran,” the Al-Qabas
newspaper reported on March 31, quoting Sheikh Mohammed. Iranian
President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  rejected the claims on April 4
saying that Kuwait is a friend of Iran.  Tension has been building between Iran and nations of the
Gulf Cooperation Council since  Saudi Arabia  and other members
including Kuwait sent forces to Bahrain last month to support
the government’s crackdown against pro-democracy protesters.  Iran’s government has condemned the troop deployment as
“meddling” and warned that the move may prove “incendiary”
for the region.  Bahrain, where a Sunni Muslim monarchy rules over a Shiite-
majority population, has accused Shiite Iran of fomenting
unrest, without citing any evidence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
