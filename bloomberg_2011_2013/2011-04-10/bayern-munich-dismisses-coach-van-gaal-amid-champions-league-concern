Bayern Munich  dismissed coach Louis
van Gaal with immediate effect, the German soccer champion said
in a statement.  Former Ajax and Barcelona coach Van Gaal, 59, was due to
leave the club at the end of the season and be replaced by Jupp
Heynckes.  Bayern, which drew 1-1 at Nuremberg yesterday, is fourth in
the Bundesliga standings and struggling to qualify for next
season’s Champions League.  Van Gaal joined Bayern Munich as coach in 2009, after
guiding  AZ Alkmaar  to its first Dutch league title since 1981.
He led Bayern to the league crown and the final of the Champions
League against Inter Milan last season.  Bayern appointed the Dutchman’s assistant Andries Jonker to
coach the team until the end of this campaign, when Heynckes
will take over.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
