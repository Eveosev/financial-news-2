Spain ’s ruling Socialist Party
narrowed the gap to the opposite  People’s Party  by more than
half after Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said he
will step down before elections next year,  El Mundo  reported,
citing a poll.  The PP would win 44.9 percent of the vote if elections were
held now, compared with 37.8 percent for the Socialists, the
Sigma Dos poll showed. In the previous survey in March, PP led
by 16.5 percentage points, El Mundo said.  The poll of 1,000 people was carried out from April 5 to
April 7 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.16
percentage points, the newspaper reported. Zapatero announced
his decision of not running for an additional period on April 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
