German Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle sees no “acute inflation threat” in the short term
and said he will raise his forecast for German economic growth
this year, Bild am Sonntag reported.  The European Union’s aid package for  Portugal  will not
burden German taxpayers, Bild quoted Bruederle as saying, adding
that Portugal must continue its reform programs
“energetically.” The situation in  Spain  is “reassuring,” he
said, according to Bild am Sonntag.  To contact the reporter on this story:
