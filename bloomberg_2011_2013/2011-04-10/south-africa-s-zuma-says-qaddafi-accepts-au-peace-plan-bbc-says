Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi 
agreed to a “roadmap to peace” proposed by the  African Union 
at a meeting in Tripoli today, the BBC reported, citing South
African President Jacob Zuma speaking immediately after the
meeting ended.  African Union Spokesman Noureddine Mezni told the British
Broadcasting Corp. in an interview from Ethiopia the plan
presented by the African Union calls for an “immediate”
ceasefire, the facilitation of humanitarian aid to whoever needs
it and the protection of foreign nationals in Libya.  The plan also calls for the adoption and implementation of
political reforms that meet the Libyan people’s “legitimate
aspirations” for democracy, justice, security, peace and socio-
economic development, Mezni said. Asked whether the African
Union’s plan requires Muammar Qaddafi’s departure from Libya,
Mezni told the  BBC  that “depends on the Libyan people.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
