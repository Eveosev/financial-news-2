Findus Group Ltd., the frozen food
company owned by private-equity firm  Lion Capital LLP , is asking
creditors to relax its loan covenants to free up 1 billion
pounds ($1.6 billion) for acquisitions, the Sunday Telegraph
reported without saying where it got the information.  The companyâ€™s syndicate of banks, including JPMorgan Chase
& Co., Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc, were asked to loosen leverage and cashflow restrictions in
a presentation last week, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
