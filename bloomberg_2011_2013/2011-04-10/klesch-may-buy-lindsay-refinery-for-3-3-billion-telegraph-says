Klesch & Co. Ltd. is in exclusive
talks to buy  Total SA (FP) ’s Lindsay oil refinery in the U.K. for as
much as 2 billion pounds ($3.3 billion), the Sunday Telegraph
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The Lindsay refinery in Lincolnshire, northeastern England,
is the country’s third-largest, and its purchase by Klesch would
be the U.K. buyout firm’s biggest acquisition, according to the
newspaper. The private-equity firm, led by Chairman Gary Klesch,
manages $6 billion and invests in commodities.  A Klesch spokesman declined to comment, the Sunday
Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
