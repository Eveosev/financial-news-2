Brazil  will seek “reciprocity” in
the relationship between Latin America’s largest economy and
 China , the Xinhua News Agency reported, citing an interview
President  Dilma Rousseff .  Brazil and China are “equals” and should work together to
benefit their economies, including joint investment in oil, as
Brazil develops its offshore reserves, Rousseff told Xinhua
before her first visit to the Asian country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
