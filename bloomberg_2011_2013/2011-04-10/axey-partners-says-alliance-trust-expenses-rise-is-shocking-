Laxey Partners Ltd. said  Alliance
Trust Plc (ATST)  hasn’t introduced a discount control mechanism because
its board doesn’t want to reveal a “shocking rise in total
expenses.”  The Isle of Man-based investment group, in an e-mailed
letter to shareholders, urged them to vote for its resolution
calling for the introduction of a discount control mechanism at
the Alliance Trust annual meeting on May 20, arguing that
company and group expenses have soared over the past five years.  Alliance Trust’s total expenses since 2006 rose 145 percent
at company level and 336 percent at group level, Laxey Partners
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
