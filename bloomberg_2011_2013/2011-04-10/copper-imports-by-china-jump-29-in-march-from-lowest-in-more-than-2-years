Copper imports by  China , the
largest consumer, climbed 29 percent in March from a two-year
low as fabricators stepped up production. Shipments fell 33
percent from the same month last year.  Inbound movements of copper and products were 304,299
metric tons compared with 235,469 tons in February and 456,240
tons in March 2010, according to the General Administration of
 Customs . The February level was the lowest since January 2009.  While the increase from the previous month reflected a
recovery in manufacturing which grew for the first time in March
in four months and the Chinese New Year holiday in February, the
decline from last year may boost concern over whether the level
of demand in the country is being sustained. Domestic prices
have traded at a discount to  London  since July on ample supplies.  “The fall in imports from a year ago reflects the negative
arbitrage we’ve seen in the past few months,” Peng Bo, an
analyst at Guosen Securities Co., said from Shenzhen. “While we
think it’s still too early to say demand from China has dropped,
it’s something to watch out for in the coming months.”  Copper consumption in the world’s second-biggest economy
usually increases from March to May when fabricators boost
output to meet demand from air-conditioner and household-
appliance makers. The Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 53.4
from 52.2 in February, the China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said April 1.  Demand Concern  “Many market participants placed high hopes on seasonal
demand, so they chose to ship more in March,” Wang Zhouyi, an
analyst at  Shanghai  CIFCO Futures Co., said by phone before the
figures were released. “Arrivals in March are usually higher
than February, which tend to be affected by the long holidays
for Chinese New Year.”  Copper stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed to a 10-month high of 177,365 tons in the week
ending March 18. They dropped 7,687 tons last week to 154,229
tons, according to a survey of 10 warehouses in Shanghai.  “March imports fell from last year,” Yan Lei, an analyst
at Guoyuan Securities Co., said from Shanghai today. “We
understand consumption in March was similar to last year’s
levels, which could only mean that smelters really ramped up
domestic production. If the output numbers don’t show that, it
may be time to start worrying about China’s copper demand.”  Slowdown Risk  China has increased  interest rates  four times in less than
six months and boosted  reserve requirements  three times this
year to mop up liquidity and tame inflation. Economists polled
by Bloomberg News forecast the  consumer price index  may rise 5.2
percent in March from a year earlier. The National Bureau of
Statistics will release the March data on April 15.  “There is a risk that a slowdown in the economy because of
the tightening measures will damp metals demand,” said Ren Gang,
head of research at Maike Futures Co. “We still need to keep a
close eye on macro-economic developments.”  China imported 390,000 tons of scrap copper in March, up
from 250,000 tons in February and 364,883 tons in March last
year, customs data showed. Imports of aluminum and the metal’s
products were 87,729 tons in March compared with 60,202 tons the
month before and 95,050 tons in March last year.  -- Helen Sun , with assistance from Glenys Sim in  Singapore .
