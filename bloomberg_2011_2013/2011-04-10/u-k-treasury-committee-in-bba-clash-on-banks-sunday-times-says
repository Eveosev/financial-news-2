U.K. Treasury Committee Chairman
 Andrew Tyrie  has clashed with British Bankers’ Association Chief
Executive Officer  Angela Knight  over her refusal to testify in
his panel’s inquiry on banking competition, the Sunday Times
reported.  “Those who follow the committee’s work will find it
incomprehensible that the BBA should have abdicated its
representative role in this area,” Tyrie wrote in a letter to
Knight cited by the newspaper.  Knight replied that her lobby group was constrained from
testifying because of competition law, according to advice from
its lawyers, the Sunday Times said. Tyrie told her he would make
their correspondence public, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
