The U.K.’s Independent  Commission 
on Banking, charged with looking at industry reform, is in favor
of so-called “bail-ins,” which would force bondholders to
share losses when banks fail, the  Sunday Telegraph  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The commission, which was set up last year, releases an
interim report tomorrow. Under the proposals on bail-ins, types
of debt can be converted into equity when certain triggers are
breached.  To contact the reporter on this story:
