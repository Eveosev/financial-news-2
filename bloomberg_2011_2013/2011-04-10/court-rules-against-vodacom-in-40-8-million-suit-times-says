Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) , the largest
provider of mobile-phone services to South Africans, has been
ordered by a judge in the Democratic Republic of Congo to place
shares worth $40.8 million in escrow, the Sunday Times reported.  The company is being sued by former consultant Moto Mabanga
who assisted Vodacom during a dispute with Congolese Wireless
Network, its partner in the DRC, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said today, without saying where it got the
information.  Mabanga was paid a $2.8 million service fee for work he
carried out during 2007 and 2008, the Times reported. He is
claiming an additional $40.8 million as a “success fee” from
the mobile phone operator, the newspaper said.  Vodacom “firmly refutes” that any amount is due to
Mabanga and will appeal the order, head of corporate affairs
Portia Maurice was quoted as saying.  Vodacom spokesman Richard Boorman could not be reached for
comment as his mobile phone was switched off.  To contact the reporter on this story:
