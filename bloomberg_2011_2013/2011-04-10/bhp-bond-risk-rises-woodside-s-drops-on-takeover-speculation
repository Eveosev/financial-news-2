The cost of protecting  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP)  bonds from non-payment rose on speculation it may bid A$46
billion ($48.6 billion) for Woodside Petroleum Ltd.  BHP credit-default swaps jumped 10 basis points to 78.5
basis points as of 9:07 a.m. in Sydney, according to Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. That’s the highest since Jan. 20
and would be the biggest daily increase since Aug. 18, the day
the world’s biggest mining company made a $40 billion bid for
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., CMA prices show.  Contracts on Woodside dropped 10 basis points to 95.5, ANZ
prices show. That’s the biggest fall since Aug. 18, and the
lowest level since May 4 last year, according to CMA.  BHP is in talks to buy Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s 24 percent
stake in Woodside and make a full takeover offer, the Sunday
Times reported in  London  yesterday, saying that UBS AG is
advising Shell. BHP would swap some of Woodside’s assets,
including the Sunrise natural-gas field, for Shell’s holding,
the newspaper said, citing people it didn’t identify.  Credit-default swap contracts pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities if a borrower fails to
meet its debt agreements. A drop signals improving perceptions
of creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  To contact the reporter on this story:
