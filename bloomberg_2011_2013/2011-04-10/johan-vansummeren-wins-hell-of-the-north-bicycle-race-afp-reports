Belgium ’s Johan Vansummeren won
yesterday’s Paris-Roubaix, the cycle race known as the “Hell of
the North” because of its testing conditions.  Garmin team rider Vansummeren beat defending champion
Fabian Cancellara of  Switzerland  and Maarten Tjallingii of the
Netherlands into second and third positions. A portion of the
160-mile course to Roubaix, near the Belgian border, is renowned
for its difficulty as it’s ridden over cobblestones.  Vansummeren finished in 6 hours, 7 minutes, 28 seconds, a
winning margin of 19 seconds.  “I think this is the luckiest day of my career,” he was
cited as saying by  Agence France-Presse . “This is the reason
I’m a professional cyclist.”  Three-time Paris-Roubaix winner Tom Boonen of Belgium had
to drop out after mechanical trouble, followed by a crash.  Two days ago more than 1,000 amateurs rode the course in a
non-race event, as a prelude to yesterday’s competition. They
traveled over a shorter course of about 100 miles.  Tour de France organizer Amaury Sport Organisation staged
the  Paris-Roubaix Challenge  on the back of a cycling boom in the
U.K. About 25 percent of people signing up for the inaugural
event were from the British side of the Channel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
