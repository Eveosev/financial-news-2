Israel ’s Cabinet approved a
proposal by Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  to print a
new series of shekel bills featuring four leading poets and
writers.  The notes, which will incorporate state-of-the-art anti-
counterfeiting elements, will be issued within three years,
according to the proposal posted on the website of the  Prime
Minister’s Office . The poets that will appear on the bills are
Rachel Bluwstein, widely known as Rachel the Poetess, Shaul
Tchernichovsky, Leah Goldberg, and Nathan Alterman.  “The governor chose personages that are among the
outstanding artists in the area of poetry and literature, whose
lives, works and achievements are interwoven with the story of
the national rebirth of the State of Israel,” the proposal
said. The Cabinet approved the proposal, according to a text
message from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office.  The new bills will replace the currency that has been in
circulation since 1999, and will carry the same shekel
denominations: 20, 50, 100 and 200 shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
