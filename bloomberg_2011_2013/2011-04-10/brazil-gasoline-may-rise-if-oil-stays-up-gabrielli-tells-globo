Brazil may need to increase
gasoline prices if oil remains around $122 a barrel,  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli told
 O Globo  newspaper.  International oil prices are being pushed up by a
speculative capital flow into commodities contracts, caused by
low interest rates in several countries, more than by unrest in
the Middle East, Gabrielli said, according to  O Globo .  The Brazilian government may opt to cut taxes in order to
absorb the price increase and keep from transferring it to the
consumers, O Globo quoted Gabrielli as saying.  A decision on whether to increase gasoline prices hasnâ€™t
been made, Gabrielli added, according to the Rio de Janeiro-
based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
