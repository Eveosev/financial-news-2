Iraq took delivery of more than
200,000 metric tons of wheat from  Australia , Hassan Ismail
Ibrahim, director general of the country’s Grain Board, said.  Four ships delivered the wheat from Australian suppliers at
the southern port of Umm Qasr, Ibrahim said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The country had received 400,000 metric tons of wheat from
U.S. and Australian suppliers and 127,000 tons of rice from
 Thailand , Ibrahim said April 5.  The board in February signed 12 contracts to buy 850,000
tons of wheat from the U.S. and Australia.  Iraq plans to import 4 million tons of wheat this year,
mainly from the U.S. and Australia, Trade Minister Khairallah Hassan said March 24. Local output of the grain is forecast to
be 1.5 million tons this year, he said.  Surging food costs and rising unemployment have helped spur
protests in the region, toppling leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt 
this year. Iraq produces about half of the grain it consumes and
is seeking foreign investment in agriculture to help meet a
target to be self-sufficient within three years, Agriculture
Minister Ezzeddin al-Dawla said March 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
