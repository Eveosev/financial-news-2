A halt in payments by  Germany ’s
four largest utilities into a fund for renewable energy means
they believe nuclear-power use won’t be prolonged,  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing the environment minister.  The contributions are advance payments based on the
additional earnings utilities would receive if the operational
life spans of Germany’s nuclear reactors are extended, said the
minister, Norbert Roettgen, according to an e-mailed preview of
an article that the newspaper plans to publish tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
