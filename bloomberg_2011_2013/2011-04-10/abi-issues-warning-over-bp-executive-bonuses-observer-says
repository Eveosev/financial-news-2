BP Plc (BP/)  faces a showdown with
shareholders this week at its annual meeting after the
Association of British Insurers issued an “amber top” alert
over executive bonuses, the Observer reported.  The ABI wants investors to examine the payment of bonuses
of more than 100,000 pounds ($164,000) to two BP executives
Byron Grote and Iain Conn.  “Shareholders have to decide if they think these bonuses
are appropriate after the year the company had,” an ABI
spokesman told the newspaper, referring to the Gulf of Mexico
oil spill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
