Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
granted non-Syrian resident families the right to own a property
in the country,  Syrian Arab News Agency  said.  A foreigner, his wife and children who are legal residents
in the country will be allowed to own property on condition that
its minimum built-up area is 140 square meters, the agency said,
citing a presidential decree. A license from the interior
minister is necessary for the purchase, it said.  Diplomatic missions and consulates, as well as Arab,
regional and international organizations, commissions and
cultural centers are also allowed to own real estate for their
headquarters or as residency for their members, SANA said. The
prior approval of the prime minister should be obtained in these
cases, it said.  Foreign owners are not allowed to dispose of the property
within two years of the purchase without the permission of the
interior minister, the  news agency  said.  Syria , where Assadâ€™s Baath party has been in power since
1963, is the latest Middle Eastern country to be hit by a wave
of uprisings that ousted longtime rulers in Egypt and Tunisia,
and sparked armed conflict in  Libya . Assad has issued a number
of decrees granting more freedoms amid ongoing protests
demanding political change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
