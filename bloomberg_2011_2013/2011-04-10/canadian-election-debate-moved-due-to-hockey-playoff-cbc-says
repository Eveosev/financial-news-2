Canadaâ€™s four largest political
parties have agreed to change the date of their French-language
debate this week to avoid a conflict with a playoff hockey game,
the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported.  The debate, which was planned for April 14, has been
rescheduled to take place a day earlier, the CBC said on its
 website . The CBC is a member of the broadcasting group that
organizes debates among leaders during election campaigns.  The leaders from the four parties -- the governing
Conservative Party, the  Liberal Party , the  New Democratic Party 
and the  Bloc Quebecois  -- are also scheduled to hold an English-
language debate on April 12. The federal elections will be held
on May 2.  The parties and the broadcasters changed the date of the
French-language debate after the National Hockey League
scheduled a playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and
Boston Bruins on the same day, the CBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
