Soybean imports by  China , the
world’s biggest, climbed 51 percent in March from the lowest
level in more than two years. Shipments fell 13 percent from the
same month last year.  Inbound movements were 3.51 million metric tons compared
with 2.32 million tons in February and 4.01 million tons in
March last year, according to customs data released today. The
February total was the least since October 2008.  “The jump from February was not surprising as demand
slowed that month because of Lunar New Year and a halt in
customs’ operations” delayed some cargoes, said Chen Baomin, a
manager at Jilin Grain Group Co. in Dalian. The March volume was
lower than the monthly average, which “confirms our view that
low crushing margins and weak demand for meal have forced people
to slow shipments,” he said today.  Imports averaged 4.4 million tons a month from the start of
the marketing year on Oct. 1 through to Feb. 28, according to
customs data compiled by Bloomberg.  China is predicted to import 57 million tons of soybeans in
the 2010-2011 marketing year by the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture , 13 percent more than the year before. Purchases
increased 21 percent to 25.6 million tons from Oct. 1 through to
March 31 from 21.2 million tons a year before, customs data show.  A slowdown in demand for livestock feed may keep imports
this year as low as 51 million tons, analyst Monica Tu of
Shanghai JC Intelligence Co. said in interview April 6.  The country imported 320,000 tons of vegetable oils in
March compared with 410,000 tons in February and 560,000 tons in
March 2010, customs data show.  --Glenys Sim, William Bi. Editor: James Poole  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
