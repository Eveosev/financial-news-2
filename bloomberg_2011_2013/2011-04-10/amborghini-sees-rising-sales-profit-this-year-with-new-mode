Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Lamborghini unit
forecasts a rise in sales and profit this year as it introduces
its Aventador LP 700-4 model, after sales fell 3.6 percent last
year following the end of production of its Lamborghini
Murciélago.  Sales declined to 271 million euros last year, from 281
million euros in 2009, the Italian automaker said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. Pretax profit “improved versus 2009, while
still remaining below profitability,” it said.  Der Spiegel reported April 9 on its website that
Lamborghini lost almost 40 million euros last year, compared
with a 35 million-euro loss in 2009, citing internal VW
documents.  Lamborghini spokesman Raffaello Porro said in an e-mailed
statement today that the company’s 2010 loss narrowed compared
with 2009, without giving any figures. He declined to comment on
the  Der Spiegel  article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
