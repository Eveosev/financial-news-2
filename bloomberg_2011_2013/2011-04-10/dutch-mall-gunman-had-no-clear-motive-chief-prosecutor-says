A gunman who killed six people at a
Dutch shopping mall did not have a clear motive, Chief Public
Prosecutor Kitty Nooy said.  Tristan van der Vlis, 24, who lived with his father, left a
message in digital files that was more “spiritual” than
“threatening,” Nooy told a press conference today.  Three weapons were found at the scene of yesterday’s
shootings at the “Ridderhof” mall in Alphen aan den Rijn, a
city 13 miles (21 kilometers) south-west of Amsterdam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
