Aldermore Bank has appointed Jayne Almond as a non-executive director, the Independent on Sunday
reported, without saying where it got the information.  “We are still very much in expansion mode, so her
experience of operating in a high-growth environment is going to
be valuable,” Philip Monks, Aldermore’s chief executive
officer, told the newspaper.  Almond is the former head of  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s mortgage
business and sits on the U.K.’s Competition Commission, the
Independent on Sunday said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
