The yield on  Israel ’s 10-year
Mimshal Shiklit government bond climbed to the highest level
this month as investors shift to inflation-linked securities
amid rising interest rates.  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 fell,
pushing the yield up 4 basis points to 5.32 percent at the 4:30
p.m. close in  Tel Aviv , matching that of March 30. The yield is
now just 3 basis points below the 5.35 percent close on March 28
before the  Bank of Israel  raised its benchmark lending rate to 3
percent, the highest level since November 2008.  “Traders are getting used to the fact that rates are going
higher and inflation is rising,” Ron Eichel, chief economist at
Tel Aviv-based Meitav Investment House Ltd., said by telephone.
“They are shifting from nominal bonds to CPI-linked securities
as consumer prices are surging and  oil prices  are around $113.”
Inflation is a problem not just in Israel as commodities
increase, he said.  Crude jumped 2.3 percent to close at $112.79 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on April 8, the highest
settlement since September 2008. In February, the inflation rate
in Israel surged to an annual 4.2 percent, the fastest pace in
more than two years and outside the target range of 1 percent to
3 percent for the second month.  The shekel strengthened 0.4 percent to 3.435 per dollar on
April 8, the highest since September 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
