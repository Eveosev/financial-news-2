Japanese  stock futures  fell after
oil prices rose to the highest since September 2008, sparking
concern higher energy costs will damage corporate earnings.  American depositary receipts of  Hitachi Ltd. (6501) , Japan’s
third-biggest company by sales, retreated 0.8 percent from the
closing share price in Tokyo on April 8. Those of Nissan Motor
Co., the country’s No. 3 automaker by market value, declined 0.9
percent after Citigroup Inc. lowered its rating on Japan’s auto
sector to “sell” from “buy,” saying investors haven’t priced
in the impact on earnings from last month’s earthquake and
tsunami.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,720 in Chicago on April 8, compared with 9,770
in  Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,750 in
Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time.  “Higher oil prices have a negative effect on corporate
earnings,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist
at Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo. “There’s no outlook for
improvement” after the disaster.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.4
percent today. In New York, the index dropped 0.4 percent to
1,328.17 on April 8, as oil’s rally to a 30-month high drove
down transportation shares and investors speculated a fight in
the  U.S. Congress  over the federal budget may shut the
government for the first time since 1996.  Crude Oil Surge  Crude oil for May delivery rose 2.3 percent to $112.79 a
barrel in  New York  on April 8, the highest settlement since
Sept. 22, 2008. Oil advanced for a fourth day as the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization escalated its air campaign over
Libya and on concern unrest may spread to other energy-exporting
countries in the Middle East.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.8 percent this year
through April 8, compared with gains of 5.6 percent by the S&P
500 and 2.1 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.7 times for the S&P 500 and 11.4 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Japan’s Cabinet Office is scheduled to announce machinery
orders for February at 8:50 a.m. in  Tokyo . The median forecast

percent decline from the previous month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
