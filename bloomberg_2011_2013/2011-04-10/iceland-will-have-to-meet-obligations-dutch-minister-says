Iceland still has to meet its
international obligations and the Netherlands will ultimately
get back the money it is owed, Dutch Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  said in a statement.  Icelanders rejected a depositor claims accord with the U.K.
and Netherlands is “disappointing”  De Jager  said today. “Time
for negotiation is over,” he said. “Now the court will decide
on this.”  The Dutch government will consult with the U.K. on the next
steps to be taken, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
