OAO  Tatneft (TATN)  produced 6.39 million
metric tons of crude oil in the first three months of 2011,
little changed from the year-earlier period, the Russian company
said today in an e-mailed statement.  In March alone, Tatneft accounted for about 80 percent of
total oil output in the Republic of Tatarstan, where the company
works, producing 2.2 million tons of crude.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow
