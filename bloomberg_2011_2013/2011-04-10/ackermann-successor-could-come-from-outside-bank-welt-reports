Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  Chief Executive
Officer  Josef Ackermann  will leave the lender when his contract
expires in May 2013 and said his replacement doesn’t have to be
a person from within the company or have long-standing banking
experience,  Welt am Sonntag  reported, citing an interview.  The candidate with the “right personality can learn
everything” and Ackermann won’t seek a seat on the supervisory
board of Deutsche Bank, he was cited as saying by the newspaper.
Bundesbank President Axel Weber is Ackermann’s favorite to
replace him as CEO, Welt am Sonntag reported, citing
unidentified people at the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
