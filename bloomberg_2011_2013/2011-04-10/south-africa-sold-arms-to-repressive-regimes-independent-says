South Africa ’s government approved
the sale of weapons to some of the least democratic countries in
the world last year, the Sunday Independent reported, citing the
 National Conventional Arms Control Committee ’s annual report.  Military hardware valued at 35 billion rand ($5.3 billion)
was exported to 78 countries in 2010, including 70 million rand
in sales to  Libya , the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.
Additional arms deals for 27.7 billion rand were signed with 83
countries, including 10 of the 25 worst performers on the 2010
Global Peace Index, the Sunday Independent reported.  South African companies sold weapons to five countries
rated by The Economist magazine’s Democracy Index as the least
democratic states in the world, namely Libya,  Saudi Arabia ,
Syria, Guinea Bissau and Equatorial Guinea, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
