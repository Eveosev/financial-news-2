Arsenal kept its Premier League
title ambitions alive with a 3-1 win at Blackpool today.  Aston
Villa  beat Newcastle 1-0.  Abou Diaby, Emmanuel Eboue and  Robin van Persie  scored for
Arsenal. Gary Taylor-Fletcher got the home team’s goal. James
Collins headed Villa’s winning goal in the first half.  Arsenal included 41-year-old goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in the
line-up, making his 200th appearance for the club after coming
out of retirement. He replaced  Manuel Almunia , who was injured
during the warmup today.  Manchester United  leads the table on 69 points. Arsenal has
62, Chelsea 58, Manchester City 56, Tottenham 53 and Liverpool
45. United has played one more game than the other teams.
Blackpool stays 17th in the 20-team league, a point above the
three-team drop zone.  Villa’s win takes the club up to 14th spot, five points
clear of the relegation area. Newcastle stays ninth.  Yesterday, Chelsea beat Wigan 1-0 as  Fernando Torres 
continues to seek his first goal for the Blues after a 50
million-pound ($82 million) transfer from Liverpool.  Tomorrow, Manchester City plays at Liverpool.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
