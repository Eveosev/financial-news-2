(Corrects death toll in fourth paragraph of story published
April 11. See EXTRA and MET for more on Middle East unrest.)  Yemeni protesters called for the
rejection of a Gulf Arab plan under which President Ali Abdullah Saleh would transfer power to his vice president and the
opposition would lead a unity government.  Using a loudspeaker before tens of thousands of
demonstrators in the capital of Sana’a today, a protest
organizer read a statement on behalf of the opposition, saying
that Saleh should step down immediately and that any dialogue he
may have should be with the “martyrs” of the country’s
political crisis.  The Gulf Cooperation Council called for the transition of
power to Vice President Abduraboo Mansur Hadi and the creation
of an opposition-led national unity government, Abdel Latif al
Zayyani, secretary general of the GCC, told reporters in the
Saudi capital,  Riyadh , late yesterday. Yemen’s government hasn’t
made any decision yet on whether to accept the proposal, Saleh’s
spokesman, Ahmed al-Sufi, said today in a telephone interview.  After almost three months of protests in Yemen, the poorest
Arab country, elements of Saleh’s army, government and tribal
base have abandoned him. At least 37 Yemenis, including 24
children, have been killed since Feb. 18, the  United Nations
Children’s Fund  said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
