Islamic insurance contributions
worldwide will rise 31 percent to $12 billion in 2011 from $9.15
billion last year, according to a report by Ernst & Young MENA
published today.  “Key takaful markets are characterized by low insurance
penetration rates and comparatively high rates of economic
growth, leading to a positive outlook for the sector as a
whole,” Ashar Nazim, executive director and Islamic Financial
Services Leader at Ernst & Young, wrote in an e-mailed
statement.  Saudi Arabia  is the biggest market for Shariah-
compliant insurance, followed by  Malaysia  and the  United Arab
Emirates , according to the report.  Takaful is based on the Islamic principle of mutual
assistance and is similar to mutual insurance in that members
are the insurers as well as the insured. Conventional insurance
is prohibited under Shariah law because Muslim scholars judge it
to involve speculation and interest payments, both of which are
forbidden.  The industry grew 33 percent globally in 2010 from $6.9
billion the previous year, the report said. Ernst & Young MENA
is part of Ernst & Young LLP, a New York-based consultancy
company.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
