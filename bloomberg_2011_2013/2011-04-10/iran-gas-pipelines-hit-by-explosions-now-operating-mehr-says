Three natural-gas pipelines in
central  Iran  hit by explosions on April 8 have been repaired and
are now operational,  Mehr  reported, citing Majid Boujarzadeh,
spokesman for National Iranian Gas Co.  The state-run  news agency  didn’t give details of the
explosions in Qom province. The pipelines carry gas from
refineries in southern Iran to the country’s north and
northwest, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
