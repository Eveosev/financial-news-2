Permira Advisers LLP put a value of
at least 750 million pounds ($1.2 billion) on All3Media
Worldwide Ltd., according to the Sunday Telegraph.  Permira owns a little more than half of the U.K. television
production company, which it values at 12 times earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, the paper said,
citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. Previous
valuations were about 600 million pounds, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
