China ’s soybean imports, the
world’s biggest, soared 51 percent in March from the lowest
level in more than two years in February, according to data from
the Beijing-based customs office.  Imports increased to 3.51 million metric tons from 2.32
million tons in February, the lowest level since October 2008,
according to customs data. Shipments were 4.01 million tons in
March 2010, according to customs data compiled by Bloomberg.  Purchases increased 21 percent to 25.6 million tons in the
marketing year that began Oct. 1 from 21.2 million tons the year
before, according to Bloomberg calculations.  China is predicted to import 57 million tons of soybeans in
the 2010-2011 marketing year by the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture , 13 percent more than the year before. A slowdown in
demand for livestock feed may keep imports this year as low as
51 million tons, analyst Monica Tu of Shanghai JC Intelligence
Co. said in interview April 6.  The country imported 320,000 tons of vegetable oils in
March, compared with 410,000 tons in February and 560,000 tons
in March 2010, customs data show.  --Glenys Sim, William Bi. Editor: James Poole  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
