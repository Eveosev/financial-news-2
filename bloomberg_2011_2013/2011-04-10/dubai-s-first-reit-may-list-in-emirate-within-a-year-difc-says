Emirates REIT , Dubai’s first real-
estate investment trust established in November 2010, may list
on Nasdaq Dubai within a year, an official at the Dubai
International Financial Centre Authority said.  “That could happen easily within one year,” Marwan Ahmad
Lutfi, deputy chief executive officer, told reporters at an
Islamic insurance conference in Dubai today. Emirates REIT is a
joint venture between  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB)  and  France ’s
Eiffel Management, which is based in the DIFC and governed by
the Dubai Financial Services Authority.  The DIFC, a tax-free  business park  in the United Arab
Emirates’ financial hub, is in talks with a number of “top-
tier” banking institutions and financial advisors on starting
Islamic REITs. “You’ll start to hear about them more and more”
in the next few quarters, he said.  Emirates REIT is a Shariah-compliant trust that invests in
commercial and residential properties.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
