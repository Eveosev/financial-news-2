The U.K. government will find
alternative forms of clean energy to meet its goal of cutting
greenhouse gas emissions even if nuclear developments are
delayed, an energy minister said.  Charles Hendry , a junior minister in the Department of
Energy and Climate Change, acknowledged there’s a risk that
companies delay or scale back investments in new nuclear power
because of risks highlighted by the atomic accident in Japan.  “There is a very serious gap, and we’re working very hard
to close that gap,” Hendry said on BBC Radio 4 in London
yesterday. “We see much of our coal plants closing by the
middle of this decade and much of our nuclear plants as well.”  Britain aims to build 10 new nuclear plants in the next
decade to replace the ones that are retiring. Companies
including  EDF SA (EDF) ,  E.ON AG (EOAN)  and  RWE AG (RWE)  are considering investments
in new U.K. atomic plants.  Hendry said the U.K. can reduce carbon emissions even
without new nuclear plants, though it hasn’t yet mapped out how.
His comments indicate ministers are resigned to the idea that
fewer atomic plants will be built.  “There is a challenge,” he said. “We’re not there yet.
We can meet our objectives without nuclear. It would be more
expensive. Safety is our top priority.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
