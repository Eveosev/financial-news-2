New Zealand  Labour leader Phil Goff’s popularity rose to its highest ever as party head,
showing he’s unhurt by the resignation of former education
spokesman Darren Hughes following a sex scandal, according to a
One News Colmar Brunton poll.  Goff’s rating as preferred prime minister rose 4 points to
11 percent, while Prime Minister John Key gained 7 points to 55
percent, according to a survey of 1,000 voters conducted between
April 2 and 6. Support for Key’s  National Party  climbed three
points to 54 percent, while Labour’s backing rose 1 point to 34
percent. The poll has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.  New Zealand holds general elections on Nov. 26.  Hughes resigned last month following a sexual complaint
made against him by an 18-year-old student to the police, the
New Zealand Herald said on its  website.   To contact the reporter on this story:
