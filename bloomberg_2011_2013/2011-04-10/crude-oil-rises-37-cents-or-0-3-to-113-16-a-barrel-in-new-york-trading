Oil advanced for a fourth day in
 New York  as NATO escalated its air campaign over Libya and on
concern unrest may spread to other energy-exporting countries in
the Middle East.  Futures rose as much as 0.6 percent today after warplanes
from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization destroyed Libyan
government tanks around the cities of Ajdabiya and Misrata. A
Syrian army officer was killed as protests spread across the
country. Unrest has toppled leaders in Egypt and Tunisia and
spread to Bahrain, Yemen and Oman.  “There seems to be a broadening of the conflict,” said
 Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy economist at National
Australia Bank Ltd. in Melbourne. “There was further news of
conflict in Libya and protests in Yemen and  Syria . Those events
don’t ease market fears about the possible supply shutdowns.”  Crude oil for May delivery gained as much as 67 cents to
$113.46 a barrel, in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , and was at $113.13 at 10:14 a.m. Sydney
time. The contract rose $2.49, or 2.3 percent, to $112.79 on
April 8, the highest since Sept. 22, 2008. Futures are 34
percent higher the past year.  Brent oil for May settlement traded at $126.80 a barrel, up
15 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract increased $3.98, or 3.2 percent, to end the session at
$126.65 on April 8.  Brent Premium  The European benchmark traded at a premium of $13.86 a
barrel to U.S. futures on April 8. The difference between front-
month contracts in  London  and New York surged to a record $19.54
on Feb. 21 as unrest spread in the Middle East and North Africa
and stockpiles climbed at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for New York futures. The spread averaged 76 cents last year.  Hedge funds  raised bets on higher crude prices as continued
airstrikes in Libya raised concerns about production after the
country’s conflict ends. Speculators increased net-long
positions, or wagers on rising prices, by 4.5 percent in the
seven days ended April 5, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission’s weekly Commitments of Traders report.  Three oilfields with a combined output of 400,000 barrels a
day have been targeted by troops loyal to Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi , Barclays Plc analysts led by London-based Amrita Sen,
said in an April 8 report. Production would be less than a third
of its pre-conflict level even if the rebels took control of the
country’s fields, Nomura Holdings Inc. said in a report.  Nigerian opposition parties gained against the ruling
People’s Democratic Party in parliamentary elections held April
9 in  Africa ’s top oil-producing nation. Elections in 2003 and
2007 were marred by violence, voter intimidation and the
stuffing of ballot boxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
