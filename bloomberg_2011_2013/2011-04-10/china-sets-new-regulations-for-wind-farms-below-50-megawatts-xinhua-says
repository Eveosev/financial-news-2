China wind farms below 50 megawatts
in capacity will need the approval of the National Energy
Administration before proceeding, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported today, citing unidentified people.  The new rules will be announced in the first half of this
year, according to the report. The small wind farms have
previously needed only the approval of local governments, Xinhua
