Corn may rise this week on
speculation that a doubling in prices the past year has not
slowed demand for grain used in feed, fuel and food. Soybeans
may rise as the U.S. plants the fewest acres in three years.  Twenty-two of 29 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo 
to Chicago on April 8 said corn will advance this week, and 20
of 30 respondents forecast a gain for soybeans. Last week on the
Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for May delivery gained 4.3
percent to $7.68 a bushel, a fourth straight gain. May soybean
futures fell 0.1 percent to $13.9225 a bushel.  Last weekâ€™s advance in corn was expected by the majority of
respondents surveyed on April 1, while the drop in soybeans was
a surprise. Since 2004, the surveys have been correct 56 percent
of the time for corn, and 53 percent for soybeans.  Bullish on corn: 22    Bullish on soybeans: 20
