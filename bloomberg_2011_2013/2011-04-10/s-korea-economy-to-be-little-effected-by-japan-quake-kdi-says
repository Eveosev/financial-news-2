The South Korean economy won’t be
significantly affected by  Japan ’s March 11 record earthquake and
ensuing tsunami, though some companies may have difficulty
procuring parts, a government-run think tank said.  Japan only buys about 6 percent of South Korean exports,
limited exposure that can shield Korea from a contraction in
Japan’s economy as long as demand is expanding globally,  Korea
Development Institute  said in a monthly report released today.  Korean manufacturers that are dependent on Japanese
companies for parts may have a hard time maintaining production,
the Seoul-based institute said. Japan made up more than 20
percent of intermediate goods imports for South Korea as of 2010,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
