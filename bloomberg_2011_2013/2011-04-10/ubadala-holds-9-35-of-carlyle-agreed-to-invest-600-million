Mubadala Development Co., an Abu
Dhabi government-owned investor, held a 9.35 percent stake in
 Carlyle Group  at the end of last year, according to a bond
prospectus of the United Arab Emirates-based company.  Mubadala in December invested $500 million in Carlyle Group
in exchange for convertible subordinated notes and
additional equity in the worldâ€™s second-biggest private equity
firm. Mubadala also agreed to invest as much as $600 million in
funds managed by Carlyle, according to the prospectus obtained
by Bloomberg News today.  A spokesman for Mubadala declined to comment when contacted
by Bloomberg News today.  Mubadala hired banks to arrange meetings with bond
investors starting April 6 in  London , according to a banker
involved in the transaction. Barclays Capital, HSBC Holdings
Plc, National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC, Societe Generale SA and
Standard Chartered Plc are arranging the meetings, the banker
said.  Meetings took place in  Abu Dhabi  and Dubai today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
