An arms deal announced in 1997 by
then deputy president  Thabo Mbeki  will cost South African
taxpayers about 71 billion rand ($10.7 billion) by the end of
2011, City Press  said , citing research to be published in a book
by former African National Congress member Andrew Feinstein.  Defense Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said in January the deal
will cost the country about 47 billion rand, the newspaper
reported. This amount doesn’t include “hidden” financing costs
which total about 49 percent of the total expense, Paul Holden,
the book’s lead researcher, was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
