The  New York  Rangers clinched a
National Hockey League playoff berth after beating the New York
Devils 5-2, and then waiting for the Tampa Bay Lightning to
eliminate the Carolina Hurricanes.  The Rangers (44-33) defeated the Devils in their final
regular-season game at Madison Square Garden yesterday afternoon.
The Lightning beat the Hurricanes 6-2 last night, giving New
York the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.  “A significant portion of the guys got together to watch
the game,” Rangers’ captain Chris Drury told reporters during a
conference call. “The superstitious guys stayed away.”  Before the Hurricanes’ game, New York had 93 points and
Carolina had 91 points. Carolina held the tiebreaker over the
Rangers and would have advanced to the postseason at New York’s
expense with a win.  The Rangers open the playoffs with a series against the
 Washington Capitals  (48-23), who sit atop the Eastern Conference.
Two years ago, New York had a 3-1 first-round series lead over
 Washington  before losing in seven games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
