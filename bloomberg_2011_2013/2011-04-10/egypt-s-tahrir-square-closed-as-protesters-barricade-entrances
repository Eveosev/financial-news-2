Cairo’s central Tahrir Square was
closed to traffic as dozens of protesters barricaded several
entrances a day after it was forcibly evacuated by security
forces and soldiers.  Groups of protesters lay in makeshift tents or explained
their demands to passersby in the square, which was at the heart
of 18 days of protests that toppled former president  Hosni Mubarak .  “We want to see court rulings against the people who were
running this country,” said 31-year-old Mahmoud Youssef, who
owns a clothing store. “We want speedy trials. We want to feel
that something is being done.”  Tens of thousands of people gathered on April 8 in the
downtown area demanding prompt trials for the ousted president
and his top officials. Several hundred remained in the square
overnight, defying a curfew, and were dispersed by security
forces and troops after clashes.  The ruling military council denied using live ammunition,
saying that there were “outlaws” among the protesters. Four
soldiers and nine civilians were wounded in the violence and 42
people were arrested and being interrogated, the council said.  “The armed forces did not inflict any harm on the
protesters or the outlaws,” Adel Omara, member of the Supreme
Council of the Armed Forces said at a press conference
yesterday. One person was found shot dead after the troops left
the square, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
