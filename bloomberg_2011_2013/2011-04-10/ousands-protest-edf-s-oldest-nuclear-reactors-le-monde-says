About 3,800 people, many from
 Germany , gathered today near Electricite de  France  SA’s oldest
nuclear plant at Fessenheim to demand its shutdown,  Le Monde 
reported, citing a police estimate of the crowd.  Protesters carried banners saying “Let’s Get Out of the
Nuclear Era” and “Fukushima, No Thanks” and are planning
another demonstration on April 25, according to the newspaper.  The reactors at EDF’s Fessenheim plant, located 1.5
kilometers -- or less than a mile --from the German border,
began operating in 1978. Protesters in Germany and two Swiss
cantons are calling on France to shut the plant in the wake of
the Fukushima accident in  Japan  even as the French nuclear
safety watchdog mulls whether to allow EDF to run it for another
decade to 40 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
