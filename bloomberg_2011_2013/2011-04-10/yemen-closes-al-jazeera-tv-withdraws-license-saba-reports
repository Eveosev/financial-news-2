Yemen has closed the office of Al
Jazeera television and withdrawn the Doha, Qatar-based network’s
license to report from the country, state-run Saba news agency
reported, citing an unidentified official.  The decision to permanently close the news bureau followed
what the report called a "sabotage scheme aimed at inciting
strife."  Yemen recalled its ambassador to  Qatar  for consultation
following remarks by Qatar’s prime minister about political
tensions in the Arabian Peninsula country, Saba reported
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
