France ’s drug regulator advised
pulling a medication made by Les Laboratoires Servier to treat
vertigo, eye diseases and tinnitus because it doesn’t work and
has side effects.  Vastarel, which has the chemical name Trimetazidine, and
generic versions don’t have “recognized benefits” for the
treatment of three medical conditions and have “well-
documented” side effects, Agence Francaise de Securite
Sanitaire des Produits de Sante, or Afssaps, said in a  statement 
on its  website  dated April 8.  The regulator recommended use of the drug be stopped and
said it has started a process for suspension which includes a
hearing and a referral to the European Medicines Agency,
according to the statement. The drug is sold in about 20
European countries.  Trimetazidine was approved for use in France in 1978 to
treat eyesight disturbances, vertigo and chronic ringing in the
ears, according to Afssaps. The decision to advise suspension of
the drug followed a regulatory committee hearing April 7.  The decision on Vastarel comes after Servier’s Mediator
diabetes drug was suspended because it may have caused between
500 and 2,000 deaths, according to French regulators.  Servier is a closely held drugmaker based in Neuilly-sur-
Seine, outside of Paris. Officials at Servier weren’t
immediately available for comment outside regular business
hours. Security staff who answered the phone said to call back
tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
