Turkey may hold a referendum on
whether to hold early local elections on Oct. 27, 2013, because
the parliament approved the change without the required two-
thirds majority, said Nurettin Canikli, a senior government
lawmaker.  The parliament voted 360-72, while at least 367 votes are
needed in the 550-seat parliament to avoid a referendum on the
constitutional amendment. The elections otherwise would have
been held in the spring of 2014.  “The president may approve and directly send it to a
referendum or return it to parliament asking for a new vote,”
Canikli said by telephone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
