crude in the fourth quarter because of plant halts and a lower
demand outlook, according to the IEA.  Rates will drop to 75.4 million barrels a day in the period
compared with 75.8 million in the third quarter, the Paris-based
agency said today in its monthly report.  European refiners, “buoyed by a dramatic turnaround in
refining margins” have been postponing seasonal maintenance and
are processing more crude through the system, amid reduced
output capacity from last year, according to the report.  Serbia’s Naftna Industrija Srbije AD, an oil refiner
controlled by OAO Gazprom Neft, bought a fuel storage facility
in Kostinbrod in neighboring  Bulgaria , the company said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
