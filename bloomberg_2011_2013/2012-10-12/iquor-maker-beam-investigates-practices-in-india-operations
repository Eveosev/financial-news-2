Beam Inc. (BEAM) , the maker of  Jim Beam ,
Maker’s Mark and Canadian Club liquors, said it’s investigating
its operations in  India  after a report of possible violations of
the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  “Based on a routine internal audit of operations in India,
we are taking a closer look at the actions of certain
individuals and practices in the India business,” Clarkson Hine, a spokesman for the Deerfield, Illinois-based company,
said yesterday in an e-mail. Beam won’t disclose details of the
review, he said.  The company’s investigation centers on whistle-blower
allegations of financial misconduct at its India unit, the Times
of India reported Oct. 11, citing unnamed people familiar with
the matter. The U.S. law bars corporate employees or their
agents from paying bribes to government officials to get or
retain business or to secure an improper advantage.  Beam has asked India senior management to stay away from
work during the investigation, according to the newspaper.  The company “is committed to the highest standards of
business conduct,” Hine said. “India is an attractive market
for Beam and we’ll continue investing in our future growth
there.”  Beam rose 0.5 percent to $56.80 at the close in  New York .
The  stock  has advanced 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
