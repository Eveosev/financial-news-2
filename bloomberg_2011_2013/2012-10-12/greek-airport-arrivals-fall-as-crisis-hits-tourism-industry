International arrivals at Greek
airports dropped 2.5 percent in the first nine months of the
year, as the European economic crisis continued to crimp
spending on travel.  The number of passengers arriving from abroad declined to
10.3 million from 10.6 million in the same period a year
earlier, the Athens-based Association of Greek Tourism
Enterprises, known as SETE, said  in a statement  on its website.  Arrivals from abroad dropped eight out of the first nine
months of 2012, the statement said. International arrivals fell
0.2 percent to 1.7 million in September. Images of protests
against austerity measures broadcast around the world have hurt
the country’s image, Athens International Airport said last
month.  Tourism,  Greece ’s biggest industry, accounted for almost 16
percent of gross domestic product and one in five jobs in 2011,
according to the London-based  World Travel and Tourism Council .  Arrivals from abroad at Athens International, the country’s
biggest airport, dropped 12 percent to 2.1 million in the nine
months through Sept. 30, SETE said.  The 15 airports covered in the survey account for 95
percent of all foreign arrivals in Greece by air.  To contact the reporter on this story:
