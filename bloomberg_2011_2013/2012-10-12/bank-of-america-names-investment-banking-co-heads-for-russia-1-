Bank of America Corp. , the second-
biggest U.S. lender, named Aukse Jurkute and Roman Zilber co-
heads of corporate and  investment banking  for Russia and the
Commonwealth of Independent States.  Jurkute was previously head of  equity capital markets  for
Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, while
Zilber joined in 2010 as head of corporate banking for Russia
and the CIS from Credit Agricole SA, the  Charlotte , North
Carolina-based company said in a statement today. Andrei Arofikin, who re-joined as managing director of investment
banking in Moscow five years ago, will leave, the firm said.  The bank is reorganizing its senior managers in Russia
after two departures in the past 18 months. Riccardo Orcel, head
of investment banking for central and eastern Europe, the  Middle
East  and Africa, departed last year to join VTB Group, Russia’s
second-biggest lender. Country head Konstantin Korishchenko said
in August he would step down.  Bank of America, which hasn’t advised on a single share
sale in Russia this year, advised on one share sale last year, a
$3.3 billion offering by VTB. That made it the third-ranked
adviser on Russian stock offerings that year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The bank is placed third in Russian
mergers and acquisitions so far this year, up from 38th in 2011,
the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
