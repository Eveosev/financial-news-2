percent this week after  China ’s slowing economy prompted  Alcoa

a weekly decline, as a weaker dollar spurs demand for the metal

percent this week. December-delivery futures were little changed

percent weekly advance. Soybeans for November delivery dropped
1.2 percent to $15.305 a bushel, extending the decline in the
