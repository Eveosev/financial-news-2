U.K. commercial real estate values
fell for the 12th consecutive month in October as a sluggish
economy persisted, Investment Property Databank Ltd. said.  The average value of stores, offices and warehouses
declined 0.3 percent from September, led by retail and warehouse
properties, London-based IPD said in a statement today. Total
return, which combines changes in real estate values and rental
income, was 0.3 percent in October, up from 0.2 percent in
September.  “Twelve months of falling capital values marks another
rather unfortunate milestone for the U.K. property sector, ”
Phil Tily, a managing director at IPD, said in the statement.
“There has been some improvement in underlying performance for
the last few months.”  The U.K.  economy  came out of the first double-dip recession
since the 1970s in the three months through September.  Bank of
England  Governor  Mervyn King  said today the economy may shrink
in the current quarter and the  National Statistics Office  said
jobless claims rose at the fastest pace in more than a year and
job creation slowed.  The IPD index was compiled from appraisals of 3,496
properties valued at 32.2 billion pounds ($53 billion) at the
end of October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
