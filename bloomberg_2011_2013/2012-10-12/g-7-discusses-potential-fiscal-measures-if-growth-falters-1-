 Some Group of Seven nations raised
the possibility of extra fiscal measures if the global recovery
weakens, Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said after a G-7
meeting in  Tokyo  yesterday.  “There has been some discussion by some of the
participants along those lines, generally relating to the
European situation,” Flaherty said on a conference call with
reporters today. “The continent is in recession and there’s
rising unemployment.”  Europe’s woes are at the center of this week’s meetings of
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Tokyo as
finance chiefs work to sustain a flagging global recovery. The
Washington-based lender said this week that failure to remedy
them was helping to generate an “alarmingly high” risk of a
steeper slowdown.  Flaherty also said it’s worth considering proposals by IMF
Managing Director Christine Lagarde to give  Greece  and other
troubled European countries more time to meet fiscal targets.  “I think it’s certainly worth considering,” Flaherty
said. “The challenge in  Europe  now is the European economy is
in a recession and there is some interest in trying to create
some economic growth in the euro zone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
