The  International Monetary Fund 
expects to send a team to Egypt by the end of this month for
talks on the $4.8 billion loan that the country has requested,
the fund’s top  Middle East  official said.  Egypt needs to develop economic policies with broad public
support “to ensure that the program that is developed would be
implemented,”  Masood Ahmed , IMF director for the Middle East
and Central Asia, told reporters at a press conference in Tokyo
broadcast on the IMF’s website.  Egypt’s economy is expected to grow 2 percent this year and
3 percent in 2013, the IMF forecasts. The economy probably
generated about 250,000 jobs in the past year, while 750,000
young people joined the workforce, Ahmed said.  Asked whether Egypt should devalue its currency as part of
an IMF-backed program, Ahmed said that the fund is discussing a
“range of measures” with Egyptian officials and it wasn’t
appropriate for him to say which ones would be adopted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
