Two Florida city finance and
customer service officials have been suspended with pay pending
an investigation into billing undercharges for water and sewer
services, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reported.  An auditor will be hired to examine how a billing mistake
involving incorrect water rates and faulty meters cost Port
Orange at least $825,000 in lost revenue for water and sewer
services provided to Daytona Beach Shores customers over 43
months, the newspaper said, citing city officials.  “There are a lot of questions and few answers at this
point,” the newspaper quoted Mayor Allen Green as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
