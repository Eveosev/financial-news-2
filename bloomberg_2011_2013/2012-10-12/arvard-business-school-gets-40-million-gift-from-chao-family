Harvard Business School received $40
million from the James S.C. Chao and Family Foundation for
scholarships and an executive education building.  About $35 million of the donation will go to constructing
the education center that will be named for the late Ruth Mulan
Chu Chao, the business school said today in a statement. The
remaining $5 million will go to scholarships for students of
Chinese heritage, according to the statement.  Four of James and Ruth Chao’s daughters attended the
school, located in  Boston , across the Charles River from Harvard
University’s main campus, the statement said. They include
Elaine Chao, U.S. Labor Secretary from 2001 through 2009 under
former President George W. Bush.  Ruth Chao “was a positive, optimistic person who believed
in the transformational power of education regardless of gender
in developing leaders for the world,” Elaine Chao said in
today’s statement.  Ruth Chao died in 2007 and was memorialized by Elaine Chao
in a tribute before the U.S. Senate. James Chao is founder of
New York-based shipping company Foremost Group.  Harvard is the oldest and richest U.S. university, with an
endowment of $30.7 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
