The European Commission must take
action to prop up carbon prices and safeguard the cornerstone of
the bloc’s crisis-struck internal energy market, the Danish
Energy Association said.  The carbon trading system in the bloc has “almost
collapsed,” Ulrich Bang, director of EU affairs at the lobby
group, said today in an e-mailed note.  Prices in the world’s largest cap-and-trade program fell to
a record 5.99 euros ($7.77) a metric ton in April, and permits
for December were unchanged at 7.80 euros at 12 p.m. today on
the ICE Futures Europe Exchange in  London . This compares with a
price of nearly 30 euros in 2008, Bang said.  “Based on that, not much money will be invested in green
technology,” he said.  The European Commission, the EU regulator, wants to create
a single regional power and gas market by 2014. Low carbon
prices, combined with a series of other problems, make this a
remote prospect, the Danish lobby group said.  “The EU’s internal energy market is in a state of
crisis,” Bang said. “Member states do not comply with
directives, while constantly introducing new subsidy mechanisms
that distort competition.”  The EU’s internal market is often presented as the bloc’s
biggest success story in the past 20 years, Bang said.  “There is a long way to go before we have an internal
electricity and gas market in the EU,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
