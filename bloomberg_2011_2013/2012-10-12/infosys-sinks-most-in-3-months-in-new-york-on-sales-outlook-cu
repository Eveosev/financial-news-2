Infosys Ltd. (INFY)  tumbled the most since
July in  New York  after a reduction in its sales-growth forecast
spurred some analysts to downgrade their recommendations on
 India ’s second-largest software services exporter.  American depositary receipts of Bangalore-based Infosys
tumbled 7.6 percent to $44.54 at the close of trading in New
York, the biggest one-day slide since July 12. The  Bank of New
York Mellon India ADR Index  slipped 3.3 percent to 1,009.38,
also the largest loss in three months.  Infosys reduced its forecast for this fiscal year’s revenue
to 395.8 billion rupees ($7.5 billion) from a July estimate of
403.6 billion rupees, as Chief Executive Officer S.D. Shibulal
said the business environment continues to be “challenging.”
Dolat Capital Market Ltd. cut Infosys’ Indian shares to
accumulate from buy, while IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd.
moved them from hold to reduce,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , India’s third-biggest software services
provider, lost 1 percent to $8.57, a one-month low, while ADRs
of  ICICI Bank Ltd. (IBN) , India’s largest lender, fell 1.4 percent to
$39.50, the lowest since Sept. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
