The European Parliament and member
governments may reach a compromise on bonus curbs for bankers
that limit how far pay awards can exceed fixed salaries,
lawmaker  Sharon Bowles  said.  Bowles, who heads the assembly’s Economic and Monetary
Affairs Committee, said a compromise deal would need to set a
“multiple” of how many times a bonus can exceed fixed pay.  “At the moment I think the feeling is very strong” in the
parliament in favor of setting a maximum ratio, Bowles, who has
applied to replace  Mervyn King  as governor of the Bank of
England, said today in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“The Pulse” with  Guy Johnson .  Bankers are facing a backlash from European lawmakers
determined to cut variable pay as part of a quest to reshape
lenders as utilities rather than money-making machines. The
regulatory push comes as public outrage and shareholder
rebellions this year forced some banks, including  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
and  Barclays Plc (BARC) , to retreat from their initial pay plans.  As part of this push, lawmakers in May put a ban on bonuses
that exceed fixed salaries into their negotiating position on a
draft bank capital law.  The move has been opposed by lenders and some governments,
which have argued that it might harm the bloc’s competitiveness.  Parliament has asked governments “to come back with a
proposal that is a fixed ratio,” Bowles said. “I think the
middle ground is a multiple.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
