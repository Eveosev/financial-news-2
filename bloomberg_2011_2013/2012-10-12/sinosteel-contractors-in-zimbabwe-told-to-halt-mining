Zimasco Ltd. will cut ferrochrome
production in  Zimbabwe  by 40 percent as the global slowdown
damps demand from its customers in the U.S.,  Europe  and  Asia .  The “global economic crisis and lower than expected
economic activity” had forced it to reduce output, the unit of
Sinosteel Corp. said in a faxed statement today from Harare, the
capital.  Chrome-ore mining will be cut on the North Dyke, George
Zimuto, a Zimasco contractor who has been told to halt mining,
said by phone yesterday. Most of Zimbabwe’s ferrochrome deposits
lie in the Great Dyke, a mountain range that runs the length of
the country, rich in ferrochrome, platinum and gold deposits.  Zimuto said he and all contractors on the North Dyke were
told to return all railway track and equipment to Zimasco’s
Mutorashanga office.  Sinosteel acquired Zimasco in 2007. The company has mined
ferrochrome on the Great Dyke since the early 1900s and has been
owned by local businesses, Union Carbide Corp. and  Rio Tinto
Plc. (RIO)   “The North Dyke around Mutorashanga mines very high-
quality chrome from very narrow seams, which is more
expensive,”  Zimuto said today. “The South Dyke mines in
Shurugwi and Lalapanzi have thicker seams which are cheaper to
mine.”  The closing means “well over 1,000” people will be out of
work, he said. “It’s going to devastate the area.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
