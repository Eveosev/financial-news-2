Apple Inc. (AAPL) , which is fighting patent
battles with competitors around the globe, agreed to license a
68-year-old design for a clock for Swiss railway stations to use
in its iPhone and iPad devices.  State-owned railway operator SBB said last month that while
Apple had infringed rights to the motif, it was “proud that
Apple took an SBB design.” Apple will now be allowed to use the
look of the station clock, designed in 1944 and featuring a
“striking red second hand in the shape of a railway guard’s
signalling disc,” on its mobile devices, SBB said in a
statement today. The companies agreed not to disclose the fee.  “It is a design icon that has obviously lost none of its
appeal in the digital age,” SBB said in today’s statement. “It
symbolises the innovation and reliability that are key qualities
attributed to both SBB and  Switzerland  as a whole.”  SBB has allowed companies such as watchmaker Mondaine Watch
Ltd. to use the design under a license. Apple has been embroiled
in patent battles with smartphone maker Samsung Electronics Co.
in courts across four continents after Apple accused the South
Korean peer of copying its devices last year.  Officials at Apple, which included the design in the
updated version of its iOS mobile operating system in September,
didn’t immediately return phone calls. Last month, London-based
Apple spokesman Adam Howorth said the disputed design appears
only on the iPad and isn’t on the iPhone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
