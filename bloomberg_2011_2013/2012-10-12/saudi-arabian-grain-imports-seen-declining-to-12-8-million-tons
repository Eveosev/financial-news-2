Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest
barley buyer, may cut grain imports by 5.9 percent in the
current 2012-13 marketing year, the  United Nations ’ Food &
Agriculture Organization forecast.  Shipments are poised to drop to 12.8 million metric tons in
the year through June from 13.6 million tons in the prior
period, the Rome-based UN agency wrote in a  report  on its
website dated yesterday.  Saudi Arabia plans to expand wheat-storage capacity by 27
percent over the next three years from 2.52 million tons,
lifting its reserves to a year of consumption from 10 months
now, according to the FAO. The country is phasing out wheat
cultivation by 2016 to preserve water.  Wheat imports in 2012-13 are forecast to be 2.3 million
tons, partly for use in  animal feed  to substitute for barley and
yellow corn, the FAO said. Barley deliveries are expected to be
7.2 million tons and corn purchases are seen at 2.2 million
tons, the report showed.  The country harvested an estimated 1 million tons of wheat
this year, compared with 1.1 million tons in 2011, according to
the FAO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
