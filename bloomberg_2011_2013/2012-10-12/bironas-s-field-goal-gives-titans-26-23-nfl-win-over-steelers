Tennessee  beat the Pittsburgh
Steelers for the first time in four attempts as Rob Bironas
kicked a field goal as time expired to give the Titans a 26-23
win in Week 6 of the  National Football League .  “We have confidence in our kicker,” Titans wide receiver
Kenny Britt, who caught a fourth-quarter touchdown pass, said in
a televised interview. “We knew he could pull it out.”  The win at LP Field in Nashville last night takes the
Titans to 2-4 this season, while the Steelers drop to 2-3.  Bironas kicked a 22-yard field goal to open the scoring
before Shaun Suisham tied it with a 29-yard field goal.
Pittsburgh quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger  then found  Mike Wallace  with an 82-yard touchdown pass before Bironas added a
38-yard field goal to make it 10-6 for the Steelers after the
first quarter.  The Titans kept the visitors scoreless in the second
quarter and held a 16-10 halftime lead through a 1-yard scoring
run by Jamie Harper and a 47-yard field goal by Bironas.  The Steelers then scored 13 unanswered points on a 1-yard
touchdown run by Baron Batch and field goals of 28 and 52 yards
by Suisham before Tennessee tied it at 23-23 with four minutes,
19 seconds to play as quarterback  Matt Hasselbeck  found Britt
with a 5-yard scoring pass.  Bironas then sealed the win with a 40-yard field goal.  Hasselbeck completed 25 of 44 pass attempts for 290 yards,
one touchdown and one interception, while Roethlisberger went
24-of-40 for 363 yards, one touchdown and one interception.  To contact the reporter on this story:
