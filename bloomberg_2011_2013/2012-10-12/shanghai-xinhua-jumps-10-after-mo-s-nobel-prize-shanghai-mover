Shanghai Xinhua Media Co. jumped 10
percent, leading a rally for Chinese publishing companies, after
Mo Yan won the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature.  Shanghai Xinhua surged by the daily limit to 6.23  yuan  as
of 10:08 a.m. local time, on course for the biggest advance
since April 7, 2005. Changjiang Publishing & Media Co. jumped 8
percent to 7.55 yuan.  Time Publishing & Media Co. (600551)  climbed 4.8
percent to 11.04 yuan. The benchmark  Shanghai Composite index 
rose 0.6 percent to 2,115.37.  Mo, 57, won the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature for blending
folk tales, history and contemporary life with “hallucinatory
realism,”  the Swedish Academy said. The son of a coal miner is
the second Chinese author to win the prize: Gao Xingjian, who
took French citizenship several years before, won in 2000.  “After the Nobel prize win, publishers and distributers
are bound to benefit because the sales of Mo Yan’s books will
rise,” Zhao Yue, an analyst at Rising Securities Co., said in a
phone interview in Beijing. “In the longer term, the country is
pushing for an improvement in the cultural sphere, so the
outlook for this industry is positive.”  When Gao won the literature prize in 2000, he was denounced
by Chinese officials, because he had left the mainland for
 France . The state-owned Chinese news agency Xinhua reported,
“Mo’s win brought joy to his supporters, as no Chinese national
has ever won the Nobel prize in literature in its century-long
history.”  In 2007, President Hu Jintao said in a speech that  China 
needed to promote its culture at home and abroad. This past
February, the Ministry of Culture said it would double the size
of China’s culture industry by 2015, to about $140 billion, with
an annual growth rate of 20 percent.  -- Editors: Allen Wan, Ravil Shirodkar  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
