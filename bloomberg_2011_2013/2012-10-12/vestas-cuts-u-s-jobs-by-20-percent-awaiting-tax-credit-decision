Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
biggest maker of  wind turbines , has cut about a fifth of its
U.S. jobs as it waits for lawmakers to decide whether to extend
a tax credit for the industry.  The reduction has taken its workforce in the U.S. and
 Canada  to about 2,600 employees from more than 3,400 at the
beginning of the year, the Aarhus, Denmark-based company said
today in a  statement  on its website, which added more detail to
an announcement made late yesterday.  The cuts came even though Vestas had its “busiest year
ever in the U.S. and Canada by supplying wind turbines to more
than 20 new wind power projects,” Martha Wyrsch, president of
Vestas’s Americas unit, said in the statement. “However, the
U.S. wind industry has slowed, largely due to the uncertainty
surrounding the federal Production Tax Credit extension.”  Vestas is struggling to return to profitability after
losing money in 2011 and in the first two quarters of this year.
It’s said it may cut an additional 1,600 U.S. jobs if lawmakers
don’t renew the credit, which expires at the end of the year.
The credit gives an incentive of 2.2 cents a kilowatt-hour for
wind power.  The job reductions announced today are included among the
3,735 cuts already announced this year. In 2012, the
manufacturing workforce at Vestas’s four  Colorado  factories has
been slashed to about 1,200 from 1,700. That includes the
sacking this week of about 18 percent of workers at two blade
factories in Brighton and Windsor.  “Vestas will continue to scale its workforce up or down
depending on business needs and market demands,” the company
said today. In yesterday’s statement, it noted a “significant
reduction” in turbine orders for next year.  Vestas fired 75 workers earlier this week at its Brighton
plant after cutting about 30 workers at the same plant on Aug.
21. About 90 workers were affected at a plant in Pueblo,
Colorado on Aug. 13. The company seeks to cuts its global
workforce about 16 percent this year to 19,000 people.  To contact the reporters on this story:
