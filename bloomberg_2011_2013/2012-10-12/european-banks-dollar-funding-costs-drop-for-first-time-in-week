The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell for the first time this week, according
to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 25 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:13 a.m. in
 London , from minus 26 yesterday according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The one-year basis swap was little changed at 26
basis points, or 0.26 percentage point, below Euribor.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another rose from a five-year low. The difference
between Euribor and overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-
OIS spread, was 12.4 basis points after reaching 11.75
yesterday, the lowest since August 2007.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.095
percent yesterday from 0.092 the day before.  The Eonia swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing
costs over the next three months, fell to 8.7 basis points from
9.3 yesterday.  Lenders left  overnight deposits  at the  European Central
Bank  little changed at 243 billion euros ($315 billion)
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
