Brevan Howard  Asset Management LLP,
Europe’s second-largest hedge fund, is considering leasing a new
office in London, according to a person with knowledge of the
matter.  Brevan Howard is in negotiations to rent space at 8 St.
James’s Square, a 105,000-square-foot (9,720-square-meter)
property under development in London’s West End, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the negotiations
are private. Brevan Howard currently leases 38,000 square feet
of space about a mile away at 55 Baker Street.  Brevan Howard is considering the expansion after it
outperformed most other hedge funds last year. Its assets under
management rose by $2.5 billion to $36.7 billion in the first
six months of 2012. St. James’s Square is home to BP Plc’s
headquarters, private clubs and the  Chatham House  think tank.  An affiliate of  Green Property Ltd . is developing the St.
James’s Square site, which it expects to be completed by late
2013, according to its website. Planning was sought to allow as
much as 105,000 square feet of  office space , according to a
December 2010 filing with the City of Westminster, the local
governing authority.  Brevan Howard officials declined to comment.  Alan Howard ,
48, founded Brevan Howard in 2002 with four other fixed-income
traders from Credit Suisse AG.  The firm’s Master Fund, with more than $25 billion, gained
12 percent last year.  Macro hedge funds , which trade currencies,
bonds, commodities and  interest rates  based on global economic
trends, fell 7.4 percent in 2011 on average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Master Fund is up about 2 percent
this year, according to investors.  Brevan Howard announced in July that it had opened a New
York-based investment firm that would manage money on behalf of
the Master fund. Brevan Howard U.S. Investment Management LP,
the  New York  affiliate, oversees about $800 million, according
to an August regulatory filing.  Howard relocated from  London  to Geneva in 2010. Reuters
reported earlier today that the hedge fund was considering
leasing space at the St. James’s Square site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
