Global refiners will process 400,000
barrels a day less crude in the fourth quarter because of plant
halts and a lower demand outlook, according to the  International
Energy Agency .  Rates will drop to 75.4 million barrels a day in the period
compared with 75.8 million in the third quarter, the Paris-based
agency said today in its monthly  report .  Crude demand was revised up by 140,000 barrels a day for
the third quarter, as “robust refinery margins lifted runs in
 Europe , more than offsetting lower-than-expected U.S. runs in
September,” the agency said.  “In both regions, the bottom line is that exports have
become a key driver of refining activity and profits, not just
the outlet for surplus product that they used to be,” the IEA
said.  European refiners, “buoyed by a dramatic turnaround in
refining margins,” have been postponing seasonal maintenance
and are processing more crude through the system, amid reduced
output capacity from last year, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
