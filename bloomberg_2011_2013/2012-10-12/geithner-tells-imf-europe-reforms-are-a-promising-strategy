Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said  Europe ’s plan for a banking union and fiscal
reforms is a “promising strategy.”  “This broad framework offers a more promising strategy for
addressing the crisis,” Geithner said today in a statement at
the International Monetary Fund annual meeting in  Tokyo .
“However, what is important is how it will be applied in
practice.”  Geithner has offered this week his strongest endorsements  
yet of the euro region’s plans for tackling the crisis that
is undermining global growth. While attending the IMF and 
World Bank annual meetings, he said Europe has finally crafted 
a policy armory that’s robust enough to beat back the sovereign
debt turmoil.  Geithner also said today that IMF quota reforms aim to 
create a formula that better “reflects countries’ weight in the 
global economy and would organically increase the voice of
dynamic economies over time.”  The IMF failed to agree at its meeting on changes to voting
that would give emerging economies greater clout at the
institution, while vowing to have a deal in place by January.
The IMF’s quotas determine how much member countries may borrow
and their voting power.  On the U.S., Geithner said it should enact a fiscal plan
that brings down the deficit and debt over several years while
continuing to support jobs and growth in the short term. On
 China , he said the nation needs to do more to strengthen
domestic demand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
