Canadian  stocks  fell for the fourth
time in five days as raw materials and bank shares declined.  Avion Gold Corp. (AVR)  dropped 5.4 percent as shareholders voted
on Endeavour Mining Corp.’s C$389 million ($397 million) offer
to purchase the company. Alacer Gold Corp. fell 5.2 percent as
the price of the metal fell for the first time in three days.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 51.63
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,182.32 at 12:38 p.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark equity gauge is down 1.9 percent this week, on
pace for its third weekly loss in the past four.  Mining and financial stocks contributed most to losses on
the S&P/TSX as all 10 groups declined. Gold for December
delivery slipped 0.5 percent to $1,762.40 an ounce in New York,
extending the weekly decline to 1 percent.  “That magic number of $1,800 looks like it’ll be hard to
break through,” said  Ian Nakamoto , director of research with
MacDougall MacDougall & MacTier Inc., in an interview from
Toronto. The firm manages about $4 billion. “People also may be
disappointed by earnings and the poor outlook.”  Companies in  Canada  and the U.S. began reporting third-
quarter earnings this week, with Alcoa Inc. posting results that
included a weakening aluminum outlook on an economic slowdown in
China. Nakamoto said he was surprised the sentiment is so poor
as he had expected weak earnings to be priced into the markets
already.  Gold Slides  Avion Gold lost 5.4 percent to 88 Canadian cents. The
company said shareholders voted overwhelmingly in support of the
offer from Endeavour Mining to buy the company.  Alacer Gold (ASR)  slumped 5.2 percent to C$6.20 and Centerra Gold
Inc. fell 2.7 percent to C$11.93. Barrick Gold Corp. retreated
1.5 percent to C$38.46 as gold futures declined amid concern
that demand for bullion has weakened in China, the world’s
largest buyer after  India . Gold imports from Hong Kong fell 29
percent in August from July amid a seasonal slowdown and as
higher prices deterred buyers, data from the Census and
Statistics Department of the Hong Kong government show.  OceanaGold Corp. (OGC)  rose 2.7 percent to C$3.44 after
announcing it has signed an agreement with commodity trader
Trafigura for the sale and purchase of copper concentrate from
the mining company’s Didipio project in the  Philippines .  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE)  lost 0.7 percent to C$33.27 as crude
for November delivery fell 0.7 percent to $91.46 a barrel in New
York, erasing earlier gains of as much as 0.6 percent. Prices
are up 1.8 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
