International Monetary Fund Managing
Director  Christine Lagarde  said global growth is not fast enough
to curb unemployment.  In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. in
Tokyo, Lagarde said growth in advanced economies is “tepid”
and that the two main areas of uncertainty are the euro region
and the U.S., adding policy makers need to do more to provide
more certainty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
