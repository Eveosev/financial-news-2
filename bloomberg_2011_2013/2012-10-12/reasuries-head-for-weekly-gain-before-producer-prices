Treasuries rose for a fourth day as
the  Federal Reserve  bought some of the 30-year bonds auctioned
yesterday as part of its plan to keep borrowing rates low and
investors sought a refuge from  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Yields declined this week after investors showed higher-
than-average demand at three- and 10-year note auctions and the
 International Monetary Fund  cut global growth estimates. Yields
briefly pared gains after a report today showed  consumer
confidence  unexpectedly climbed to the highest level in five
years.  “The market doesn’t want the Europeans to wait too long to
find an ultimate solution, but they keep on procrastinating,”
said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist at Credit Suisse
Group AG in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with
the Fed. The central bank’s purchases “helped stabilize the
market, particularly after the decent confidence numbers,”
Jersey said. “The buyback definitely helped.”  The  30-year bond  yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.83 percent, after climbing as high as
2.88 percent, at 5 p.m. in  New York , according Bloomberg Bond
Trader data. The rate reached a record-low 2.44 percent on July
26. The benchmark 10-year note yield declined one basis points
to 1.66 percent.  The 10-year term premium, a model created by economists at
the Fed that includes expectations for  interest rates , growth
and inflation, was negative 0.91 percent. A negative reading
indicates investors are willing to accept yields below what’s
considered fair value. The average for the past 10 years is 0.44
percent. The all-time low was negative 1.02 percent on July 24.  Buying, Selling  The Fed bought $1.889 billion of Treasuries maturing from
February 2036 to August 2042 as part of its program known as
Operation Twist, in which it is replacing $267 billion of short-
term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an
effort to reduce borrowing costs and counter risks of a
recession.  “These buybacks are very powerful,” said  Ray Remy , head
of fixed income in New York at primary dealer Daiwa Capital
Markets America Inc. “There’s no supply next week and we’re
through supply this week. If nothing else happens in a vacuum,
you’re going to move to lower yields because of that.”  The central bank, which purchased $2.3 trillion of Treasury
and mortgage-related debt from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of
quantitative easing, began in September a third effort to buy
$40 billion of mortgage debt a month until the economic recovery
is well established.  Spain Bailout  A $21 billion sale of 10-year debt on Oct. 10 drew a bid-
to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with
the amount of securities offered, of 3.26 versus an average of
3.11 for the prior 10 sales. That came a day after a $32 billion
auction of three-year notes drew a record high ratio of 3.96. An
auction of $13 billion in 30-year bonds on Oct. 11 completed the
$66 billion sale of debt this week.  Treasuries extended gains after Reuters reported that the
European Stability Mechanism lacks the cash to bail out  Spain  if
the country asks for help before the end of the year. However,
guidelines obtained by Bloomberg News last month showed the fund
has the authority to raise cash through the sale of fixed-income
securities.  While the  European Central Bank  announced an unlimited
bond-purchase program on Sept. 6 to stem financial turmoil,
Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  has held off on deciding
whether to request aid, a condition the bank insists on.
European Union leaders will meet in a two-day summit in Brussels
next week.  ‘Alarmingly High’  The IMF on Oct. 9 lowered its global growth forecasts for
this year and next, predicting the world economy will grow 3.3
percent in 2012, the slowest since the 2009 recession, and 3.6
percent in 2013. The Washington-based lender now sees
“alarmingly high” risks of a steeper slowdown.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
October consumer sentiment  index  increased to 83.1 from 78.3 the
prior month, the highest level since September 2007. The gauge
was projected to fall to 78, according to the median forecast of
71 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  The  producer price index  rose 1.1 percent after a 1.7
percent gain in August, the Labor Department reported today in
 Washington . A Bloomberg survey of 76 economists called for a 0.8
percent increase. Core producer inflation, which excludes
volatile food and energy prices, held steady for the first time
since October 2011.  Thirty-year bonds have returned 3.3 percent this year,
compared with a 2.1 percent gain in the broader U.S. Treasuries
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
