Soybeans fell in  Chicago , extending
a fourth weekly slide, after a U.S. government report showed
improving prospects for global supplies. Corn and wheat dropped.  World soybean stockpiles before the Northern Hemisphere
harvest next year may be 57.56 million metric tons, 8.4 percent
more than forecast a month ago, the Department of Agriculture
said yesterday. The USDA raised its forecast for the U.S. crop
by 8.6 percent to 2.86 billion bushels, still the lowest since
2008, and maintained its outlook for record Brazilian and
Argentine harvests.  “We’re going to see some softening in prices because
supplies should be very good from South America,” Wayne Bacon,
president of grain trader Hammersmith Marketing Ltd., said by
telephone today from St. Remy de Provence,  France . “In the
meantime, the U.S. is the only supplier, so we’re looking for
high prices to remain until we get something from the harvest in
South America.”  Soybeans for November delivery declined 0.9 percent to
$15.34 a bushel by 6:42 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
leaving prices down 1.1 percent this week. The oilseed has
dropped 14 percent since reaching a record $17.89 a bushel on
Sept. 4 as the worst U.S. drought in half a century cut
production to the lowest since 2008.  Brazil, set to overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest
soybean exporter, may produce a record 81 million tons this
year, while  Argentina  may harvest 55 million tons, an all-time
high, according to the USDA. Northern growing areas in  Brazil 
may have rain and cooler temperatures in the next seven days,
helping improve crop conditions, Telvent DTN said today.  Corn for December delivery declined 0.5 percent to $7.6925
a bushel. Prices jumped 5 percent yesterday after the USDA
projected that U.S. and world inventories will be smaller than
expected. The grain, which advanced to a record $8.49 a bushel
on Aug. 10, is up 2.8 percent this week.  Wheat for December delivery lost 0.8 percent to $8.7875 a
bushel, narrowing this week’s gain to 2.5 percent. In Paris,
January-delivery milling wheat declined 0.7 percent to 261 euros
($339) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
