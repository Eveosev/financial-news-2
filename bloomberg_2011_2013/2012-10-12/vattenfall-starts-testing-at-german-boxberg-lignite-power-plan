Vattenfall AB started testing
yesterday at its 675-megawatt Boxberg R lignite-fed power plant
in eastern  Germany .  “We will start commercial operations at the beginning of
next year,” Thoralf Schirmer, a company spokesman, said today
by phone from Cottbus, Germany.  The plant cost 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) and took 5
1/2 years to build, Schirmer said.  Power stations usually have a period of testing before
commercial operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
