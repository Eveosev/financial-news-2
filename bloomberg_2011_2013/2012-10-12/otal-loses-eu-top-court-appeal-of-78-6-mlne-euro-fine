Total SA (FP) ,  France ’s largest oil
company, and its Elf Aquitaine unit lost a final appeal at the
European Union’s top court seeking to annul a 78.6 million-euro
($102 million) fine for fixing prices on bleaching chemicals.  The  EU Court of Justice , the bloc’s highest court, rejected
the appeal “in its entirety” in a  decision  posted on its
website this week.  Since none of the arguments presented by the parties “are
likely to succeed, this request has to be rejected,” the
Luxembourg-based court said in the decision dated Sept. 13. The
court also rejected a request to cut the fines.  The European Commission, the EU’s antitrust regulator,
 fined  seven companies 388.1 million euros in 2006 for fixing
prices of hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborates, used by the
pulp and paper industry and to make antiseptic and hair-care
products.  Solvay SA (SOLB)  and  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA)  previously paid
$72.8 million to settle U.S. criminal charges in a similar
cartel.  A call and e-mail to Total seeking comment on the ruling
didn’t receive an immediate response.  The cartel lasted from 1994 until 2000, according to the EU
regulator. The penalties followed a 3 1/2 year probe against 18
companies.  The case is: C-495/11 P, Total SA, Elf Aquitaine SA v.
European Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
