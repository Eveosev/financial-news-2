DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS) , Southeast
Asia’s largest lender, cut its stake in  Bank of the Philippine
Islands  in half, strengthening its capital position.  Ayala Corp. (AC) , a Philippine real-estate developer, will pay
S$757.3 million ($620 million) for a 10.4 percent stake, the
Singapore-based lender said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.
DBS, an investor in the bank since 1999, will keep a 9.9 percent
stake.  DBS has been trying to increase the share of its earnings
from overseas markets, including Indonesia and China, since
 Piyush Gupta  took over as chief executive officer in November
2009. The stake sale will help strengthen the bank’s capital
before new international rules known as Basel III are introduced
next year.  “DBS has been a strategic investor in BPI for over a
decade and it remains an attractive investment,” Gupta said in
a statement. “The transaction will allow us to continue being a
meaningful shareholder in a capital-efficient manner.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
