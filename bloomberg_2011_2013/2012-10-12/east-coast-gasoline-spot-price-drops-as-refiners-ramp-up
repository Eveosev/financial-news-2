East Coast gasoline declined against
 New York  futures as the region’s refiners  processed  the most
crude since December and fuel inventories rose in the Central
Atlantic.  Crude inputs  on the East Coast increased by 214,000 barrels
to 1.09 million last week, the highest level since Dec. 9, the
Energy Department reported. Stockpiles of gasoline grew 1
million barrels to 21.4 million in the Central Atlantic region,
which  includes  New York Harbor. That’s the sharpest rise since
July 15.  The  premium  for conventional, 87-octane gasoline declined
3.5 cents to 18 cents a gallon over futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 2 p.m. Prompt delivery dropped 11.43
cents to $3.0213 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
