The Dutch Rijnland District Water
Control Board , responsible for flood defenses in an area that
includes parts of Amsterdam, tendered a contract today to
reinforce 100 kilometers (62 miles) of aging dikes.  Embankments will be widened and stabilizing edges added to
the dike’s lower side, the Leiden, Netherlands-based agency said
on its  website . The 50 million-euro ($65 million) contract work
is needed as it’s been 30 years since substantial maintenance
and the foundation has sunk considerably, it said.  The district water control board started testing the dikes
in 2007 for new, climate-proof norms and has already granted
maintenance works for 30 kilometers of dikes.  The works tendered today will start in 2013 and be
completed by 2015, the agency said. “Improving the dikes will
stimulate the regional economy,” it said.  The Rijnland area covers 1,100 square kilometers (425
square miles) of waterways and is bordered on the northwest by
the  North Sea , according to the water board. The agency also
processes wastewater from homes and companies while its pumping
stations ensure water is always at safe levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
