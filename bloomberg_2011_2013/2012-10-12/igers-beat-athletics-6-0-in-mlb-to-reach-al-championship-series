Justin Verlander pitched a four-hit
shutout, striking out 11, to lead the Detroit Tigers into the
American League Championship Series with a 6-0 win against the
Oakland Athletics.  Austin Jackson drove in two runs and score two for the
Tigers, who won the best-of-five Major League Baseball playoff
series three games to two.  The Tigers next will play either the New York Yankees or
the Baltimore Orioles for a spot in the World Series. The
Yankees and Orioles are tied 2-2 in their series, with a
decisive Game 5 today in New York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
