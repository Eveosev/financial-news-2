Nigeria ’s $500 million of Eurobonds
rose for a third day, sending yields to a record low as the
outlook for economic growth boosts demand for the nation’s debt.  Borrowing costs on dollar debt due 2021 declined seven
basis points to 4.68 percent at 3 p.m. in London, the lowest
since their issue in January 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Yields on the international bonds of  Africa ’s biggest
oil producer have declined 147 basis points, or 1.47 percentage
points, this year.  Sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy is set to
expand 6.5 percent in 2013, President  Goodluck Jonathan  said
Oct. 10. That compares with growth of 2.1 percent for the U.S.
and 0.9 percent for  Germany  where yields on 10-year bonds are
less than 2 percent, according to International Monetary Fund
forecast and data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The likelihood of a prolonged period of weakness in the
developed world will continue to push large amounts of capital
to the emerging world - including sub-Saharan Africa - where
growth is expected to hold up relatively well,” Shilan Shah and
 Neil Shearing , London-based economists at Capital Economics
Ltd., wrote in a report today. “As African economies continue
to develop, their appeal to bond investors will only grow.”  Nigeria plans to sell $1 billion of international bonds
next year to fund gas pipelines and other infrastructure,
Jonathan said earlier this week.  Rising Crude  Nigeria’s benchmark Bonny Light crude has risen 27 percent
from its June low this year. The West African nation’s  foreign-
reserves  have increased 27 percent to $41.7 billion this year,
according to data compiled by the Abuja-based  Central Bank  of
Nigeria as of Oct. 10.  The naira fell 0.2 percent to 157.38 a dollar in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The currency has gained 3.1 percent this
year, the second-best performer in Africa, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Yields on the nation’s 16.39 percent bonds due 2022 fell
eight basis points to 13.67 percent, according to yesterday’s
prices on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.  The government’s most-traded bonds maturing in March 2014,
October 2019 and January 2022 will be added to JPMorgan Chase &
Co.’s GBI-EM indexes between Oct. 1 and Dec. 3, the bank wrote
in a note to clients Sept. 25.  Local currency bond purchases “appear to include new
entrants to the market who have been alerted to Nigeria on their
radar screen following its inclusion in the JPMorgan government
bond index,” Gregory Kronsten, head of economic research at FBN
Capital Ltd. in  London , wrote in an e-mailed note to clients
today.  Ghana ’s cedi rose less than 0.1 percent to 1.8935 a dollar
in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
