Chinese banks will undertake more
“disciplined” loan pricing as smaller lenders’ capital
constraints keep them from offering deeper discounts on credit,
Daiwa  Capital Markets  said.  The  People’s Bank of China  in July began to allow lending
at 30 percent less than officially set rates in an effort to
revive growth amid six straight quarters of economic slowdown.
China’s biggest banks are limiting discounts for their best
corporate clients to 10 percent of the benchmark, officials at
the top four lenders told Bloomberg News.  “Smaller banks are not in a position to compete given
their capital shortage, provisioning pressures, and deposit
constraints,” Hong Kong-based Grace Wu wrote in a note dated
Oct. 11.  A squeeze on net interest margins, a measure of lending
profitability, from the liberalization of  interest rates  may not
be as bad as some investors expect because less than 10 percent
of new loans this year are priced at a discount, she wrote.  To contact  Bloomberg News  staff for this story:
