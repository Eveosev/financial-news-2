U.S. Representatives  Brad Sherman 
and Howard Berman had to be separated by a sheriff’s deputy
after one Democrat called the other “delusional” during a
debate in front of cheering college students.  Sherman, 57, wrapped his arm around the shoulders of 71-
year-old Berman and shouted, “Do you want to get into this?”  a
video  from yesterday’s debate at Pierce College in  Woodland
Hills  showed. A debate moderator and the deputy stepped between
the two.  The candidates, with more than 45 years in Congress between
them, are pitted against each other for a single seat in the San
Fernando Valley because of new district boundaries and
California’s system of advancing the top two primary candidates,
regardless of party. Even before the physical confrontation,
Politico rated the battle one of the 10 nastiest House races in
the country.  Berman called Sherman “delusional” after Sherman
downplayed Berman’s role in sponsoring the Dream Act, which was
intended to provide a path for citizenship for children of
illegal immigrants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
