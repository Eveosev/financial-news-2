China’s stocks  rose, capping a
second week of gains for the benchmark index, as falling U.S.
jobless claims bolstered the outlook for exports and publishing
companies jumped after Mo Yan won the  Nobel Prize  in Literature.  China Construction Bank Corp., the nation’s second-largest
lender by assets, led  banks  higher after officials at the top
four lenders said they are resisting government pressure to
lower borrowing costs to maintain the profitability of lending
operations. Shanghai Xinhua Media Co. surged by 10 percent on
speculation Mo’s award will spur book sales.  Jiangxi Copper Co. (600362) 
paced a decline for metal producers after copper prices slipped
in  London  and a Bloomberg survey showed traders are the most
bearish in four months on concern metals demand will weaken.  “The  U.S. economy  is doing better and psychologically, it
creates positive sentiment for investors here, who believe the
global economy is improving,” said  Zhang Gang , a strategist at
Central China Securities Holdings Co. in Shanghai.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.1 percent to 2,104.93
at the close, adding to this week’s gain of 0.9 percent. The
index changed directions at least 16 times. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) 
climbed 0.1 percent to 2,304.53, led by financial companies. The
Shanghai index has fallen 4.3 percent this year on concern the
government isn’t loosening monetary policy or introducing
stimulus policies fast enough to counter the slowdown in the
economy. The gauge is valued at 9.8 times estimated earnings,
compared with the 17.8 average since Bloomberg began compiling
the weekly  data  in 2006.  U.S. Economy  First-time applications for U.S. jobless benefits dropped
30,000 to 339,000 last week, the fewest since February 2008,
Labor Department figures showed yesterday. Economists forecast
370,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey. One state accounted for most of the plunge in claims, a
Labor Department spokesman said.  The U.S. and Europe are  China ’s two biggest export markets,
making up about 35 percent of the nation’s overseas shipments,
according to Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  China Shipping Development Co. climbed 0.9 percent to 4.1
yuan. China Cosco Holdings Co. advanced 1.9 percent to 4.33
yuan. Charter rates for capesizes have risen 50 percent from
lows in mid-September because of increasing demand and customers
having to pay more to persuade shipowners to take vessels out of
lay-up, Deutsche Bank AG analysts Joe Liew and Sky Hong wrote in
a note yesterday. China Shipping and China Cosco are the
nation’s biggest operators of dry-bulk ships.  Data next will show  China’s economy  probably grew at a 7.7
percent pace in the third quarter, while exports rose 5.5
percent in September and inflation accelerated to 1.9 percent,
according to economists’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The
trade data is scheduled to be released Oct. 13, while the
inflation report will come out two days later. The GDP data is
slated for Oct. 18.  Yuan Loans  After the market close, the People’s Bank of China said in
a statement China’s new local-currency lending was 623.2 billion
 yuan  last month. The median estimate of 32 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for loans of 700 billion yuan.  The Shanghai measure’s 30-day volatility reading was at
20.4, compared with this year’s average of 16.5. About 7.5
billion shares changed hands in the gauge yesterday, about 4
percent lower than the daily average this year.  Jiangxi Copper, the largest copper producer, lost 0.8
percent to 22.04 yuan today. Yunnan Copper Industry Co.
retreated 0.4 percent to 16.52 yuan. Copper fell 0.4 percent in
London trading.  Banks Advance  Fourteen analysts surveyed by Bloomberg said they expect
prices to drop next week and seven were bullish. A further 10
were neutral, making the proportion of bears the highest since
June 1. Copper supply will outpace demand by 458,000 metric tons
in 2013, the first glut in four years and the biggest in more
than a decade, according to the Lisbon-based International
Copper Study Group, whose members include 23 nations.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., the nation’s
biggest lender, advanced 0.5 percent to 3.84 yuan. China
Construction Bank jumped 1.7 percent to 4.14 yuan.  China’s biggest banks are limiting discounts for their best
corporate clients to 10 percent of the benchmark lending rate,
the officials said, asking not to be identified as they’re not
authorized to speak publicly. The central bank in July began
allowing lenders to offer credit at 30 percent less than the
benchmark rates.  Keeping borrowing costs high may blunt efforts to revive
growth that has decelerated for six straight quarters in the
 world’s second-largest economy .  Repo Rate  The central bank has kept the reserve-requirement ratio
unchanged at 20 percent since a second reduction this year in
May and has relied on reverse repurchase contracts to inject
capital into the financial system. Yesterday, it kept the yield
on seven-day reverse repos unchanged at 3.35 percent for a sixth
sale, higher than the one-year deposit rate of 3 percent.  “The central bank’s action of keeping seven-day reverse
repo rate higher than the one-year deposit rate is sending a
clear signal that it’s not necessary to further lower benchmark
interest rates,” said Zou Yu, head of fixed income in  Shanghai 
at Asset Management Co., which oversees 29.7 billion yuan ($4.7
billion) of assets.  Shanghai Xinhua Media Co. surged 10 percent to 6.23 yuan,
the daily maximum, on speculation author Mo Yan’s Nobel Prize
win would boost book sales. Time Publishing and Media Co. added
4.9 percent to 11.05 yuan and Changjiang Publishing and Media
Co. soared 6.3 percent to 7.43 yuan.  Mo won the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature for blending folk
tales, history and contemporary life with “hallucinatory
realism,” the Swedish Academy said.  -- Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Weiyi Lim in
