PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO)  led Polish stocks
lower after Prime Minister Donald Tusk unveiled plans to
transfer shares in state-owned companies to an investment
vehicle that may sell government holdings.  PKO, the nation’s largest bank, slid 2.2 percent to 36.29
zloty at 1:35 p.m. in Warsaw, the most in a month on a closing
basis. The decline accounted for 52 percent of the drop in the
benchmark WIG20 Index, which retreated 0.7 percent. The state
treasury holds a 33 percent stake in PKO. State-owned PGE SA,
the country’s largest utility, slid 1 percent.  The government will set up Inwestycje Polskie, a special-
purpose vehicle, to take shares in state-run companies as part
of plans to finance about 90 billion zloty (28 billion) in
investments in the next six years, Tusk told lawmakers today.
The unit will receive shares before 2014 and may sell them
directly on the market, Treasury Minister Mikolaj Budzanowski
said. He didn’t say which company shares will be transfered.  “Investors are concerned about the extra supply on the
market,” Marcin Materna, an analyst at  Bank Millennium SA (MIL) , said
by phone from Warsaw. “The decline shouldn’t last because it
was known that those stakes are for sale when the government
needs money.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
