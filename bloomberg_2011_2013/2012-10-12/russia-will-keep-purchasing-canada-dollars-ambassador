Russia  plans to keep buying Canadian
dollars as part of its foreign-exchange reserves, the country’s
ambassador to  Canada  said.  “It took them some time to convince central bankers in
Moscow that Canada can be a safe haven,” Georgiy Mamedov,
Russia’s ambassador to Canada, told reporters after a Speakers
Forum event in Toronto. “I don’t see any information that would
cause me to suggest something other than buying more Canadian
dollars.”  With more than $500 billion in its reserves, the world’s
fourth largest, Russia is seeking higher returns as it
diversifies the holdings by boosting gold purchases and adding
Canadian dollars, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said in an
interview today in Tokyo.  Russia increased its holdings of the loonie in its
international reserves to 1.6 percent from 0.8 percent as of
January, cutting the euro’s share to 42.1 percent down from 43.1
percent a year earlier.  The nation began adding the Canadian dollar to its 
international reserves in 2010 to promote the use of regional
currencies in international trade and finance to reduce risks
posed by the dominance of the  U.S. dollar ,  Alexei Ulyukayev , the
central bank’s first deputy chairman, said in an interview on
Nov. 25 of that year.  President  Dmitry Medvedev  in 2009 suggested Russia would
reduce its use of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency after
the greenback lost 34 percent of its value against the euro in
2.5 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
