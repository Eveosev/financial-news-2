South African truck drivers’ unions
reached a wage agreement with employers to end a strike that led
to fuel and food shortages in the continent’s biggest economy.  The settlement “offers stability to the road freight and
logistics industry for a long time,” according to a statement
today from the Board for the National Bargaining Council of the
Road Freight and Logistics Industry.  Workers won an average annual pay increase of 8.7 percent
for three years, the  Road Freight Employers Association  said.  The agreement does “come at a premium but we believe that
under the circumstances and in the long-term it is the best
possible,” said Magretia Brown-Engelbrecht, executive officer
at the employers group. The deal is effective from March 1.  About 20,000 drivers began a strike on Sept. 24 demanding a
12 percent annual wage increase over two years. The action cut
supplies to stores, and left food rotting at ports and some fuel
pumps dry. Vehicles were set on fire as protests turned violent.  Labor unrest at platinum mines spread to other industries
after  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  agreed to raises of 11 percent to 22 percent,
compared with a 5 percent inflation rate in the country.  South Africa ’s rand reversed a slide after the accord, up
0.5 percent at 8.6187 a dollar by 3:31 p.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
