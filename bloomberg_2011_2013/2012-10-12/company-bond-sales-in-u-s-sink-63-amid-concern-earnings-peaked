Sales of corporate bonds in the U.S.
fell 63 percent this week and relative yields narrowed as
companies began reporting third-quarter results amid mounting
concern that earnings have peaked.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) ,  Japan ’s third-biggest bank by
market value, and Hudson, Ohio-based Jo-Ann Stores Inc. led
borrowers selling at least $15.7 billion of debt, following
$41.9 billion in the five days ended Oct. 5, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales were the  lowest  since $5.5 billion
in the period ending Aug. 31 and compare with a 2012 weekly
average of $28 billion.  Signals are increasing that economic growth is tapering
off, making it harder for borrowers to repay obligations. Third-
quarter profits and sales for Standard & Poor’s 500 companies
probably fell in unison for the first time in three years,
according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The
 International Monetary Fund  lowered its global growth forecast
to the slowest pace since 2009. With many U.S. companies
restricted from issuing during earnings-related blackout
periods, others are stepping in, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC’s
Jody Lurie said.  There’s “potential for a lot of international issuers
tapping the market, and high-yield issuers who aren’t public,”
Philadelphia-based Lurie, a corporate credit analyst, said in a
telephone interview. “We’ve seen some of that already. Those
two buckets are where the supply is going to come from.”  Investment Grade  Yields on bonds from the most creditworthy to the riskiest
borrowers stood at an unprecedented low 3.647 percent yesterday,
down from 3.7 percent on Oct. 5, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield Master index.
The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
decreased 2 basis points to 238 basis points this week.  Sales of investment-grade debentures during the shortened
holiday week reached at least $9.6 billion, compared with $28.4
billion last week and a 2012 weekly average of $21.5 billion,
Bloomberg data show.  Mizuho raised $2.5 billion through its Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd. unit, selling $1.5 billion of 1.55 percent, five-year
securities at a relative yield of 90 basis points and $1 billion
of 2.95 percent debt due in 2022 at a spread of 130 basis
points, Bloomberg data show.  Yields on investment-grade debt fell to an unprecedented
2.808 percent yesterday, from 2.865 percent on Oct. 5, according
to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Master
index. Spreads decreased 3 basis points to 159 basis points this
week.  ‘Getting Expensive’  ’’I’m getting a bit nervous because there’s a lot of signs
that the market is getting expensive,’’  William Larkin , a fixed-
income money manager who helps oversee $500 million at Cabot
Money Management Inc. in Salem,  Massachusetts , said in a
telephone interview. ’’Exchange-traded funds and mutual funds
are basically at record size because inflows are so strong. Any
time that happens, as a buyer, you have to be very careful.’’  Offerings of speculative-grade bonds reached at least $6.1
billion, compared with $13.5 billion last week and a 2012 weekly
average of $6.4 billion, Bloomberg data show.  Jo-Ann Stores, the specialty retailer of fabrics and
crafts, sold $325 million of seven-year payment-in-kind notes on
Oct. 9 that pay 9.75 percent in cash and 10.5 percent if the
company pays in added debt, Bloomberg data show.  “A lot of PIK issuers will come when supply levels are
running down,” Lurie said. “It’s a little bit less attractive
of an investment strategy from the investor side, and it’s kind
of enticing them in a different way.”  PIK Bonds  Offerings of PIK bonds, which allow borrowers to pay
interest with extra debt, reached $2.6 billion in the past 30
days, making up more than one-third of this year’s $6.5 billion
of deals, Bloomberg data show.  High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  Yields on junk debt fell to 7.047 percent yesterday from
7.066 percent on Oct. 5, and compare with a record low of 6.948
percent reached on Sept. 19, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II index. Spreads increased
2 basis points to 557 basis points this week.  The world economy will grow 3.3 percent this year, the
slowest since the 2009 recession, and 3.6 percent next year, the
IMF said Oct. 9, compared with July predictions of 3.5 percent
in 2012 and 3.9 percent in 2013. The Washington-based lender now
sees “alarmingly high” risks of a steeper slowdown, with a
one-in-six chance of growth slipping below 2 percent.  Corporate Earnings  Third-quarter per-share earnings at S&P 500 companies may
have dropped 1.7 percent on average after they were little
changed in the second quarter. Sales may have slipped 0.6
percent, the data show.  Many companies report third-quarter earnings through Nov.
16, Bloomberg data show.  Issuers planning sales include Brazilian construction firm
OAS SA with a sale of seven-year notes and Albea Beauty
Solutions with a $650 million issue in dollar- and euro-
denominated debt, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
