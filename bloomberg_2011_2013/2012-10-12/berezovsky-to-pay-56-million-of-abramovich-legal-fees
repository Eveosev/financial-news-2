Boris Berezovsky  agreed to pay
35 million pounds ($56 million) of Roman Abramovich’s legal fees
for a U.K. lawsuit in which Berezovsky sought compensation for
stakes in two companies he said he was intimidated into selling.  The fee deal is a “very efficient settlement,” Judge
Elizabeth Gloster said at a London hearing today.  The self-exiled adviser to former Russian President  Boris Yeltsin  sued claiming he lost about $6.8 billion, because he was
intimidated by Abramovich into selling stakes in two Russian
companies. A large portion of the legal fees were racked up
during a three-month trial which culminated in August with
Gloster rejecting Berezovsky’s claims against Abramovich, who
owns Chelsea Football Club and has a fortune of about $14.5
billion.  Both sides accused each other of dishonesty and greed
during the trial and exposed the business practices of a small
group of extremely wealthy Russians who profited from the fall
of communism and the privatization of many of the country’s
largest energy companies.  Berezovsky was “an unimpressive, and inherently unreliable
witness, who regarded truth as a transitory flexible concept,”
Gloster said in her judgment after the trial.  To contact the reporter on this story:
