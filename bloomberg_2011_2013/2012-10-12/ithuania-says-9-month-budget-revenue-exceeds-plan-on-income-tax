Lithuania benefited from more
revenue than planned in the nine months from January to
September as higher income-tax proceeds offset lagging value-
added tax collections, the  Finance Ministry  said.  Revenue increased 3.9 percent from the same period last
year to 15.54 billion litai ($5.84 billion), 168 million litai
more than planned, the ministry in Vilnius said on its website.  The total from personal income tax of 2.85 billion litai
was 148 million litai more than planned, while income from VAT
of 6.80 billion litai was 56 million litai below plan. Excise
taxes fell 3.6 million litai short of plan in the period at
2.436 million litai. Revenue from taxes on corporate profits of
751 million litai was 18.7 million litai more than planned.  Lithuania intends to cut the 2012  budget deficit  to within
the European Unionâ€™s limit of 3 percent of output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
