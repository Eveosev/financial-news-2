New Jersey revenue missed Governor
Chris Christie’s forecast by 4 percent for the fiscal year’s
first quarter, putting collections about $175 million short of
targets in the budget he signed in June.  The state collected $4.23 billion in the first three months
of the year that started July 1, according to a statement
released today by Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff. Sales taxes
came in 6.7 percent under budget, at $1.3 billion, while income-
tax collections were $1.8 billion, or 0.4 percent above
projections. The collections of all major taxes were about 2
percent higher than in the same period a year earlier.  “Income-tax collections remain strong as the state’s
economy continues to grow,” Sidamon-Eristoff said.  Christie, 50, a first-term Republican who may run for re-
election next year, has battled the Democratic-controlled
Legislature over a proposed tax cut. Lawmakers set aside $183
million in the current budget for the first phase of the
governor’s plan, though they won’t release that funding until
they deem it supported by revenue.  Collections must rise 8.2 percent to balance Christie’s
$31.7 billion spending plan for the current year, and to make up
a shortfall in the year ended June 30, the legislature’s chief
budget officer, David Rosen, said last month. Final figures for
fiscal 2012 will be published before year-end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
