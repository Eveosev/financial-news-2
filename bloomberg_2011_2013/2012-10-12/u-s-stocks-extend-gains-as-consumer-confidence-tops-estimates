U.S. stocks extended gains, trimming
a weekly slide, after an unexpected increase in a gauge of
 consumer confidence  bolstered optimism in the economy.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index climbed 0.3 percent to 
1,436.91 at 9:58 a.m. in New York and the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average was up 60 points.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
October consumer sentiment index increased to 83.1 from 78.3 the
prior month. The gauge was projected to fall to 78, according to
the median forecast of 71 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  The  S&P 500  lost 1.9 percent this week before today,
heading for the biggest drop since June 1. The benchmark equity
gauge is still up 14 percent this year as companies reported
better-than-expected earnings and the  Federal Reserve  announced
a third round of bond purchases.  Earnings pessimism among U.S. companies is climbing to
levels last seen when stocks were mired in bear markets.  Over the last four weeks, the ratio of companies saying
profits will trail estimates compared with those saying they
will exceed them climbed to 4.3, according to 69 earnings
previews compiled by Bloomberg. The rate matches peaks reached
in February 2009 and October 2001, the data show.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
