Most  Japan shares  rose even after
 Softbank (9984)  Corp. and Fast Retailing Co. fell the most in more than
a year, dragging the Nikkei 225 Stock Average to a fourth
straight loss. Automakers gained after China and Japan agreed to
hold talks over a territorial dispute.  Nissan Motor Co., the leading Japanese carmaker in China,
rose 1.5 percent. Canon Inc., a camera manufacturer that gets 27
percent of sales in the Americas, gained 2.3 percent after U.S.
jobless claims fell more than expected. Softbank, Japan’s third-
largest mobile-phone company, plummeted 17 percent on a report
it may invest in loss-making Sprint Nextel Corp. Fast Retailing
plunged 9.9 percent after its profit forecast missed estimates.  The  Topix (TPX)  Index added 0.6 percent to 718.32 at the close of
trading in  Tokyo , with 28 of its 33 industry groups gaining. The
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  slid 0.2 percent to 8,534.12 after rising as much as
0.9 percent. The gauge dropped 3.7 percent this week, capping a
four-week decline.  “The market is rebounding after it fell a good amount
without many decisive factors,” said Isao Kubo, a Tokyo-based
equity strategist at Nissay Asset Management Corp., which
oversees about 5 trillion yen ($64 billion). The diplomatic
dispute “is weighing on China as much as on Japan. I think the
both sides will try to seek some form of compromise.”  The Topix dropped 1.4 percent this year as a slowdown in
the global economy boosted demand for the yen as a haven and as
a territorial dispute with  China  saw Japanese production there
disrupted, weighing on earnings. Policy makers in  Asia , the U.S.
and Europe have introduced a series of stimulus measures to
support growth.  Stock Valuations  Shares on the Topix trade at about 0.86 times book value,
compared with 2.22 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.51
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. A number lower than one
means a company can be bought for less than the value of its
assets.  Japan and China agreed to talks aimed at reducing tensions
over a dispute over a group of islands. Officials from both
countries agreed to hold vice-ministerial level discussions at
an unspecified date, Japan’s Foreign Ministry said last night.  Carmakers whose production in China was disrupted amid
anti-Japanese protests gained. Nissan added 1.5 percent to 666
yen.  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  gained 0.8 percent to 2,338 yen, while
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  rose 1.1 percent to 2,934 yen.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  rose 0.2 percent today after the
index closed little changed in New York yesterday. Labor
Department figures showed first-time applications for jobless
benefits dropped 30,000 to 339,000 last week, the fewest since
February 2008. Economists forecast 370,000 claims, according to
a Bloomberg survey.  Softbank Slumps  Softbank dropped 17 percent to 2,395 yen, its biggest
decline since 1998. The mobile-phone carrier is seeking control
of  Overland Park , Kansas-based Sprint, according to two people
familiar with the matter. CLSA called the possible acquisition
“a cause for concern,” citing difficulties in returning the
U.S. company to profit.  Fast Retailing plunged 9.9 percent to 16,040 yen, its
biggest loss since March 2011. The apparel maker plunged after
it forecast annual profit below analyst estimates as a slowdown
in global economic growth reduces  consumer spending .  Softbank and Fast Retailing had the biggest declines on the
Nikkei 225. Without their losses, the gauge would have risen 1.4
percent today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  dropped 8.3
percent to 17.77, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.1
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading
volume on the Nikkei 225 was 15 percent above the 30-day
average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
