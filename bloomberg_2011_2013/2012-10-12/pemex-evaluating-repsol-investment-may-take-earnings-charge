Petroleos Mexicanos, the state-owned
oil producer, said it may take an earnings charge for its 9.4
percent stake in Repsol SA after  Argentina  expropriated  YPF SA (YPFD) 
from the Spanish company in April.  “A sustained decline in the fair value of these Respol
shares may indicate an impairment that would require the loss to
be recorded in earnings,” Pemex said today in a U.S. regulatory
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
