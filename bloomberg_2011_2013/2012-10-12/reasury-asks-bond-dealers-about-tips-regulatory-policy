The U.S. Treasury Department asked
bond dealers for their views on whether short-term Treasuries
will be affected by “policy and regulatory developments in the
coming months.”  The survey, released in a statement today, is for an Oct.
25-26 meeting between Treasury officials and bond dealers in
advance of the government’s quarterly auctions of notes and
bonds. The Treasury will  announce  quarterly refunding auctions
on Oct. 31.  The biggest policy and regulatory developments facing the
U.S. include the so-called fiscal cliff, the more than $600
billion of spending cuts and tax increases that would take
effect next year if Congress fails to act by the end of 2012.  The survey also asked Treasury dealers for their economic
and fiscal forecasts for the 2013 and 2014 fiscal years, and
what recommendations they have for Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities, or TIPS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
