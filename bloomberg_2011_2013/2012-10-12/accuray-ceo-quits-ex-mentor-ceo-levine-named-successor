Joshua Levine, who oversaw the sales
of Mentor Corp. and Immucor Inc., has been named chief executive
officer of  Accuray Inc. (ARAY) , the maker of radiation devices used to
treat cancer.  Levine, 54, replaces Euan Thomson, who left the company
after more than a decade, the Sunnyvale, California-based
company said today in a statement. Thomson said a new CEO would
be “healthy for the organization,” according to the statement.  Accuray’s stock, which has risen 66 percent this year
before today, has been expanding its sales after last year
acquiring TomoTherapy, which makes a 3D-imaging system for
precisely targeting radiation.  Levine “is an experienced, commercially oriented CEO with
diverse global health-care experience necessary to lead the
company to the next level of success,” said Accuray Chairman
Louis Lavigne in the statement.  Accuray fell 3.3 percent to $6.79 at 4 p.m.  New York  time.  Levine oversaw the sale of breast implant maker Mentor to
J&J in 2009 for $1.1 billion. He was the CEO of Immucor, which
makes reagents used in medical testing, last year when it was
bought by TPG Capital for $2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
