Nigeria’s revenue increased 5.3
percent to 594.7 billion naira ($3.78 billion) in September
compared to the previous month, Finance Minister Yerima Ngama
said.  The increase was due to higher oil prices and increased
production, according to a statement given to reporters today in
Abuja, the capital of  Africa ’s largest oil producing country.  Income from oil production rose 11.6% to 504.2 billion
naira in September compared to the previous month, Ngama told
reporters.  About 124.1 billion naira was transfered into the excess
crude account, bringing the balance to 1.32 trillion naira,
Ngama said. The government said in June it wants to accumulate
about 1.57 trillion naira in the account.  Nigeria distributed 566.5 billion naira to its federal,
state and local governments in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
