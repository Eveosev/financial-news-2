In 1948, when Elvis Presley was 13,
his family moved from Tupelo,  Mississippi , to  Memphis ,
 Tennessee . His father got a job as at a munitions factory, while
his mother worked as a sewing-machine operator.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Still, the family could afford to rent only a single room
in a boardinghouse, where they shared the bathroom with others.
Meals were cooked entirely on a hotplate. Heading to downtown
Beale Street, Elvis would yearn for the cool outfits displayed
in the windows of Lansky Brothers.  The Presleys were typical of the period’s blue-collar
class. World War II had brought some prosperity to the rank and
file, but the average steelworker family moved above the
federally defined poverty line only in 1953.  To counter management efforts to roll back worker gains
after the war, labor unions ordered numerous strikes. Businesses
fought back by launching campaigns that equated any infringement
on the market as a move toward tyranny.  I spoke with Joshua Freeman, author of “American Empire:
1945-2000,” on the following topics:  1. Military Might  2. Expansion of Rights  3. Predatory Capitalism  4. Cultural Costs of Security  5. U.S. Decline  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  (Lewis Lapham is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
