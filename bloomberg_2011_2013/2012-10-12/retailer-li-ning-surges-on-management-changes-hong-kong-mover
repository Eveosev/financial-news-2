Li Ning Co. (2331)  surged to a three-month
high in Hong Kong trading after the sportswear retailer reported
the departure of its chief financial officer, fueling optimism
that a new management team could help revive sales.  The stock rose 3.4 percent to HK$4.83, the highest close
since July 6, after the company said Chong Yik Kay is quitting
as chief financial officer. The Chinese retailer in July
reported the departure of Chief Executive Officer Zhang Zhi Yong
and said Kim Jin Goon, a partner at private equity investor TPG
Capital would be executive vice chairman.  The sportswear company, founded by the Olympic gold
medalist of the same name, reported a 65 percent profit drop
last year as competition escalated from  Nike Inc. (NKE) ,  Adidas AG (ADS) ,
and  Anta Sports Products Ltd. (2020)  Li Ning has said it will seek to
improve results through marketing investments, and by clearing
its inventory.  The new team led by the TPG executive “may want to
introduce more vigorous reforms to turn around the company,”
said Forrest Chan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at CCB
International. “The CFO departure isn’t a complete surprise.”  Company Secretary Lee Hung is also leaving, the company
said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
