LinnCo LLC, created to help
partnership  Linn Energy LLC (LINE)  attract more institutional
investors, advanced in its debut after raising $1.1 billion in
an initial public offering priced below the proposed range.  The shares climbed 4.8 percent to $38.26 at the close in
 New York . Yesterday LinnCo sold 30.25 million shares at $36.50
each. The company had planned to offer the shares within 5
percent of Linn’s last price before the sale, regulatory  filings 
show. Linn closed at $40.01 yesterday, making the range $38.01
to $42.01.  Each share of LinnCo represents a unit in Linn Energy, and
LinnCo will own 13.2 percent of the partnership, the Houston-
based company said in an Oct. 2 filing. Linn will use the
proceeds to pay down debt, according to filings.       Barclays
Plc, Royal Bank of  Canada  and  Wells Fargo & Co . served as lead
managers on the sale for LinnCo, whose shares are listed under
the ticker LNCO on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  Linn is an oil-and-natural gas producer focused on buying
older fields that still have stable production. Because it is
similar to a master-limited partnership, Linn avoids federal
income taxes while passing on most of its  cash flow  to its
unitholders. LinnCo is structured as a corporation, which the
company said will allow it to attract investment from pension
funds and other investors who are sometimes barred from buying
partnerships.  LinnCo’s dividends will be based on Linn’s  payouts . If Linn
maintains its $2.90 annual payment per unit, LinnCo shareholders
will earn $2.75 to $2.84 after taxes, according to filings.  Linn has increased production more than fourfold in five
years and almost doubled its reserves in 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Linn agreed to buy gas fields in Kansas
and Wyoming from  BP Plc (BP/)  this year for $2.23 billion.  Linn and other tax-advantaged partnerships bought 10
percent of the oil-producing property sold in the U.S. through
August and 26 percent of the gas-producing property.  To contact the reporter on this story:
