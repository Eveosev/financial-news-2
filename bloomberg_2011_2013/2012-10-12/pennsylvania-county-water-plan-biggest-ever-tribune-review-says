A Pennsylvania county board has
authorized a $141 million water system plan, its largest capital
improvement program ever, the Tribune-Review said.  The five-year plan by Westmoreland County calls for major
upgrades to the municipal authority’s water delivery and
treatment network, the newspaper said. Average home water bills
may rise by almost $50 a year after financing, it said.  The authority serves at least 120,000 water customers in
five counties. Plans call for upgrading the system’s three water
treatment plants, replacing pump stations and installing a new
pipe, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
