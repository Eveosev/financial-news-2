Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc 
will next week have paid the government 2.5 billion pounds ($4
billion) in fees for using the Asset Protection Scheme, the
minimum required before the lender can stop using the aid
program, according to a person briefed on the talks.  RBS, Britain’s biggest publicly owned lender, was in 2009
the only bank to join the program, which provided insurance for
losses on 282 billion pounds of its most toxic loans. The bank
has never had to draw on the policy, for which it pays the
government a fee, and has reduced the amount of loans it covers
to 112 billion pounds.  Leaving the APS removes another obstacle to the 81 percent
government-owned lender’s return to private ownership. Chief
Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  has cut assets by more than 800
billion pounds, eliminated 36,000 jobs and scaled back RBS’s
securities and Irish units since he took over from  Fred Goodwin 
when the bank was rescued in 2008.  Hester has previously said the lender will leave the APS at
the earliest opportunity. Any exit from the program must still
be approved by the U.K.’s Financial Services Authority.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier today that RBS may
exit the APS next week. A Treasury spokesman denied the report.
RBS officials in London declined to comment. FSA spokeswoman
Kirsty Clay wasn’t immediately available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
