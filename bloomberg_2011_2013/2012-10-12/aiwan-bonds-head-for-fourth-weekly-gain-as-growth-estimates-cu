Taiwan’s government bonds gained for
a fourth week, the longest winning streak in five months, as the
slowing economy spurred demand for safer assets. The island’s
dollar rallied as U.S. jobless claims fell.  President Ma Ying-jeou said in a televised speech on Oct.
10 that reviving growth will be a top priority, as Deutsche Bank
AG cut its 2012 forecast to 1.3 percent from 2.1 percent on Oct.
8, citing a slump in exports and weak domestic demand. The  Asian
Development Bank  reduced its estimate by half to 1.7 percent
last week. Overseas shipments rebounded in September after
contracting for six consecutive months.  “Yields are sliding toward a record low so traders are
acting more cautious,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader
at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “People are starting to
worry this slowdown is going to turn into a structural problem
for the economy.”  The yield on the 1.125 percent notes due September 2022
fell one basis point to 1.135 percent this week and was little
changed today, according to Gretai Securities Market. Benchmark
10-year rates reached an all-time low of 1.125 percent on July
26.  Government data on Oct. 19 may show export  orders , an
indication of shipments over the next one to three months, rose
2.04 percent in September from a year earlier, after falling 1.5
percent the previous month, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The economy contracted 0.18
percent in the second quarter from a year earlier.  Currency Gains  Asian currencies and stocks rose today after official data
showed yesterday that applications for U.S. unemployment benefit
dropped to 339,000 in the week ended Oct. 6, the least since
February 2008.  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.2 percent today to
NT$29.36 against its U.S. counterpart, the biggest gain in two
weeks. It was little changed for the week. One-month non-
deliverable forwards in the currency climbed 0.1 percent to
NT$29.16 during the five days, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 28
basis points, or 0.28 percentage point, to 3.51 percent from the
end of last week.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.39 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
