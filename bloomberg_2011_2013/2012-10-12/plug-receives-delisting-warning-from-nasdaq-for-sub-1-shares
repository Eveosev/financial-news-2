Plug Power Inc. (PLUG) , the fuel-cell maker
thatâ€™s reported net losses each quarter since its shares began
trading, received a warning that it may be delisted from the
Nasdaq Stock Market.  Plug received a notice of noncompliance today after its
shares closed below the minimum $1 for 30 consecutive trading
days, the Latham, New York-based company said in a statement. It
has until April 10 to regain compliance by posting a closing
price of at least $1 for 10 straight business days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
