Pattern Energy Group LP, a San
Francisco-based renewable-energy developer, completed financing
for the 265-megawatt Ocotillo Wind project that’s under
construction in California’s Imperial County.  The construction loan has a seven-year commercial bank
tranche, from a group that was co-led by  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and
 Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , and a 20-year tranche funded by the North
American Development Bank, Pattern said today in a statement.
The  Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS) ,  Societe Generale SA (GLE) ,
Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale and  KeyCorp (KEY)  also
participated in the commercial tranch. The project will 
use 112  Siemens AG (SIE)  2.37-megawatt turbines and is expected to be
complete early next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
