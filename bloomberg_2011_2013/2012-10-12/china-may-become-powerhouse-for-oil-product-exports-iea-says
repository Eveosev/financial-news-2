China  may boost  exports  of oil
products as its refineries expand their capacity while the
nation’s slowing economy caps demand, according to the
International Energy Agency.  “The exact scope of this evolution hinges on the potential
emergence of a mismatch between Chinese domestic demand growth
and the nation’s ambitious program of capacity expansion,” the
Paris-based IEA said in its Medium-Term Oil Market Report today.
“If all planned projects go ahead while demand growth slows as
much as we forecast, China could emerge, at least for a while,
as a new powerhouse in product exports.”  China’s role as an exporter of fuels would be helped by its
companies’ growing footprint in international refining, storage,
terminals and logistics, the IEA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
