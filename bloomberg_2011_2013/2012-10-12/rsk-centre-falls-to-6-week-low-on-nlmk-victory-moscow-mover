OAO MRSK Centre fell to the lowest
level in six weeks after a court ordered the Russian
interregional power distributor to pay 5.1 billion rubles ($165
million) to OAO Novolipetsk Steel, billionaire  Vladimir Lisin ’s
metals company.  The power grid’s shares declined 1.8 percent to 57.96
kopeks by the close in Moscow, the lowest price since Aug. 31.
About 5.45 million shares traded, 68 percent of the three-month
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The tensions between MRSK Centre and NLMK will likely
escalate, increasing the anxiety surrounding the former,” Alfa
Bank analysts said in a report today, referring to the
steelmaker by the abbreviation of its name in Russian.  MRSK Centre, an interregional power distributor, must pay
damages for accepting payment for the use of grids that it had
been subrenting from Lipetsk Trunk Grids, according to a ruling
from the Moscow Arbitration court yesterday, Evgeny Lukashevich,
an NLMK spokesman, said in an e-mailed reply to questions.  Federal Grid Co. took over Lipetsk Grids in 2008, ending
the rent and subrent agreement, and MRSK refused to return
NLMK’s payment for energy transfers, Lukashevich said.  MRSK Centre plans to dispute the court’s decision,
according to a  statement  on the power distributor’s website.  Parent company OAO MRSK Holding’s shares closed down 0.7
percent at 2.158 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
