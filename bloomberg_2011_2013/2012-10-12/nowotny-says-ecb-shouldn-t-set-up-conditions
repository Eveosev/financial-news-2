European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said the central bank shouldn’t be
involved in setting conditions for a country seeking aid from
the region’s bailout fund.  “The ECB is not a European IMF,” Nowotny said in an
interview in Tokyo today. “That also means hammering out
specific macroeconomic conditions isn’t something the ECB wants
to be involved with.”  Nowotny, who heads  Austria ’s central bank, said that it
“makes sense to use the expertise” of the  International
Monetary Fund . It “underlines the clear view of the ECB that we
are in the field of monetary policy,” he said.  Rather than negotiating terms, the ECB should focus on
observing “whether they will be fulfilled,” he said. “We
don’t want to do business in discussing this directly with the
countries involved.”  Asked whether the IMF should also be involved financially
in the ECB’s planned unlimited bond-buying program, Nowotny said
“there is a certain discussion” and “it is a bit a question
of what would add more credibility to the operation.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
