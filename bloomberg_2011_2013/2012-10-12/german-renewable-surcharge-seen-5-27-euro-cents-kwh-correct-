German grid operators will probably
increase the surcharge consumers pay for renewable energy next
year by 47 percent, according to the nation’s wind-power lobby.  The rate is expected to be set at 5.27 euro cents (7 U.S.
cents) a kilowatt-hour, Herman Albers, the BWE president, said
today in Berlin, citing calculations by the wind energy group.
It’s currently set at 3.59 euro cents a kilowatt-hour.  More than half of the fee, which is added to electricity
bills, comes from exemptions for German industry, low power-
market prices and costs held over from this year, Albers said.  “The government should cancel the exemptions for
industry” because the feed-in-tariff payments for renewables
make up only 2.26 euro cents of the new surcharge, he said.  Germany  is debating how to overhaul a clean-energy subsidy
system that helped raise the share of renewables to 25 percent
of total generation, while increasing costs. The grid operators
are due to release a statement on the surcharge on Oct. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
