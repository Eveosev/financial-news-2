Vietnam ’s five-year bonds fell,
driving the yield to the highest level since May, on concern
demand for existing securities will weaken as a budget deficit
spurs the government to borrow more. The dong strengthened.  The notes dropped for a second day after yields rose at a
sovereign debt auction yesterday. The State Treasury sold a
total 1.6 trillion dong ($77 million) of two- and three-year
bonds at 9.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively, according to
the Hanoi Stock Exchange. It issued similar-maturity bonds at
9.7 percent and 9.9 percent on Oct. 5. State spending jumped
14.5 percent to 643.2 trillion dong in the first nine months of
2012, exceeding revenue by 29 percent, according to a finance
ministry statement yesterday.  “The budget deficit is putting pressure on government bond
issuance,” said Tran Thi Thanh Thao, a Hanoi-based analyst at
MB Securities Joint-Stock Co. “The finance ministry needs to
push up yields to attract investors.”  The yield on the five-year securities climbed eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 10.32 percent, the highest
since May 3, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. It rose 17 basis points since Oct. 5, the most since
the five days ended Aug. 24, in an eighth weekly increase.  The dong rose 0.1 percent to 20,845 per dollar as of 2:20
p.m. in  Hanoi , extending this week’s gain to 0.2 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank fixed
the  reference rate  at 20,828, a level unchanged since Dec. 26,
according to its website. The currency is allowed to trade as
much as 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
