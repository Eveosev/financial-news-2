Geneva may cut its corporate  tax
rate  to about 13 percent as European Union pressure to abolish
an existing tax regime threatens to drive out more than 900
multinational companies and commodity traders.  That may replace the existing standard rate of 24.2 percent
as early as 2017, according to a  presentation  on the Geneva
cantonal government’s website. The canton said it wants the
Swiss federal government to help compensate for lost annual tax
revenue of as much as 457 million Swiss francs ($490 million),
according to the presentation.  Geneva is considering lowering the rate as the EU pushes
 Switzerland  to abandon a so-called auxiliary regime that allows
multinationals to pay less tax on income from outside the
country. That permits more than 70 commodity trading companies,
including Vitol Group and Trafigura Beheer BV, to pay an average
tax of 12 percent, according to the  Geneva Trading and Shipping
Association .  This “is a very clear, attractive and welcome
initiative,” Thierry Boitelle, a partner at Geneva law firm
Bonnard Lawson, said in a statement. “The canton of Geneva has
made clear that it intends to keep the many multinational and
trading companies already present here and that it is in the
business of attracting new companies as well.”  Companies that account for about a quarter of Geneva’s
economy and employ about 20,000 people currently benefit from
the auxiliary tax regime, according to the canton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
