Gold futures declined the most in a
week amid concern that demand for bullion has declined from
China, the world’s largest buyer after India.  Banks extended 623.2 billion  yuan  ($99.5 billion) of local-
currency loans last month, the People’s Bank of China said on
its website today, below the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of analysts. Gold imports from  Hong Kong  fell 29 percent
in August from July amid a seasonal slowdown and as higher
prices deterred buyers, data from the Census and Statistics
Department of the Hong Kong government show.  “People are worried about China’s growth, and that has
cast a gloom over gold,”  Michael Smith , the president of T&K
Futures & Options in Port St. Lucie,  Florida , said in a
telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.6 percent to
settle at $1,759.70 an ounce at 1:36 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest decline since Oct. 5. For the week, the price
dropped 1.2 percent, the most since July 6.  During the three months ended Sept. 30, gold jumped 11
percent, the most for any quarter in two years, on demand for a
store of value as central banks in the U.S., Europe and Japan
announced stimulus programs.  Silver futures for December delivery fell 1.2 percent to
$33.669 an ounce on the Comex. The 2.6 percent decline for the
week was the biggest for a most-active contract since June 22.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery slumped 1.8 percent to $1,659.30 an ounce,
capping a 2.8 percent drop for the week, the first decline in
three weeks. Palladium futures for December delivery slipped 1.8
percent to $639.05 an ounce, the biggest drop since Sept. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
