Fiat SpA (F)  has agreed to build a
factory in Russia to expand in the country’s fast-growing car
market, three people familiar with the matter said.  Fiat will finalize the deal for the factory, which will be
located near St. Petersburg, by the end of the year, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions
are private.  Russian authorities expressed concern that the Turin,
Italy-based carmaker may delay plans to invest 850 million-euro
($1 billion) in a factory that would build 120,000 vehicles a
year, because the sales slump in  Europe  freed up capacity that
could be exported to Russia.  Sergey Vyazalov, the vice governor of the St. Petersburg
region, said earlier this month that Fiat hasn’t contacted the
regional administration for three months and hasn’t presented an
investment plan.  Fiat is seeking to expand in  Russia  with the European car
market set to contract for the fifth straight year and Fiat
losing market share as it halts development of new models. By
contrast, Russian demand for cars and light vehicles jumped 14
percent in the first nine months of 2012. Sales of Fiat’s Jeep
models more than doubled to 3,455 vehicles, while demand for the
Fiat brand plunged 72 percent to 6,263 cars. Fiat plans to build
Jeep models at the new plant.  “We are working to close the deal,” Chief Executive
Officer Sergio Marchionne said today in  London . “I’m really
interested” in Russian expansion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
