Fifteen years of up-and-down swings
in U.S. stocks may finally come to an end, according to Jeffrey Kleintop, LPL Financial Corp.’s chief market strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY highlights one of four reasons for
Kleintop’s outlook, presented this week in a report: stocks are
cheap by historical standards even though the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index is approaching its past highs.  Within the past two weeks, the S&P 500 has closed less than
7 percent below its record of 1,565.15, set in October 2007. The
index was valued at 14.5 times profit as of yesterday, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price-earnings ratio stood at
17.5 when the earlier peak was reached and 31 when the index
climbed to a high in March 2000.  The ratio would have to drop below 10 for the S&P 500 to
revisit its March 2009 low, Kleintop wrote in the Oct. 8 report.
That hasn’t happened since 1985, when the economy was recovering
from inflation and unemployment rates of more than 10 percent.  Along with valuation, growth since 2000 in earnings,
dividends and the economy will lend support to stocks, the
Boston-based strategist wrote. The combination may limit the
effects of a sluggish global economy, European financial stress
and U.S. budget battles, the report said.  “Stocks are likely to weather nearly any outcome” better
than they would have at other times, Kleintop wrote. Individual
investors may be too cautious, he added, citing data from the
Investment Company Institute that showed money flowed out of
equity mutual funds in the second half of September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
