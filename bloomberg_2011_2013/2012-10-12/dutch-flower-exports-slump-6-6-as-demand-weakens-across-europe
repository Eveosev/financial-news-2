The Netherlands’  flower  and plant
exports, the world’s biggest, slumped 6.6 percent last month on
falling demand across  Europe  and plunged 23 percent in Spain
after a tax increase.  Shipments slid to 371.4 million euros ($482.2 million) from
397.7 million euros in September 2011, the Aalsmeer,
Netherlands-based Dutch Agricultural Wholesale Board for Flowers
and Plants wrote in a  report  on its website today.  Dutch flower sales to southern European countries including
 Italy  and Spain dropped this year as Europe’s debt crisis hurt
 consumer confidence , according to the report. Spain raised
value-added tax on flora to 21 percent from 8 percent last
month, further hurting demand, it showed.  “The VAT increase for flowers and plants in Spain as of
Sept. 1 immediately impacted on sales,” the board wrote.
“Rumors about an imminent VAT increase in  Germany  are also
circulating again.”  Germany, Europe’s largest economy, is the biggest market
for flowers from the Netherlands. Dutch flower and plant exports
to the country fell 4.4 percent in September to 104.2 million
euros. Shipments to Spain slid to 7.22 million euros.  Deliveries to the U.K., the second-biggest buyer of Dutch
blooms, slipped 2.2 percent to 56 million euros. Exports to
 France  slumped 6.2 percent to 46.8 million euros and shipments
to Italy fell 9.8 percent to 27.1 million euros.  Exports to Russia, the biggest client for Dutch flowers and
plants outside the EU, dropped 4.6 percent to 15.9 million
euros, the board’s data showed. Shipments to the U.S. fell 13
percent to 3.83 million euros.  “Margins are under pressure,” the board wrote. “The cost
price of flowers and plants is higher on average, but this often
can’t be passed on. Expenses, however, are increasing, among
other things because of growing payment problems.”  Total nine-month exports rose 4 percent to 4.2 billion
euros, boosted by a 33 percent jump in shipments to  Russia  and
increased deliveries to the U.K. and Germany. The board
predicted a 4 percent gain in full-year shipments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
