Morgan Crucible Co Plc (MGCR)  Chief
Executive Officer Mark Robertshaw said the maker of advanced
materials used in  body armor  and wind-turbine blades will close
facilities in Europe and shift work to lower-cost operations to
counteract a greater-than-expected drop in revenue.  Third-quarter revenue was 10 percent below the preceding
three months, the company said today in a statement. Markets in
Europe and  China  were particularly affected, the Windsor,
England-based company said.  Morgan Crucible’s advanced materials and technology
business has been hit most by global economic slowdown, with
demand at the ceramics and molten metal systems units is holding
up. The company is grappling with a drop in sales to the U.S.
Department of Defense this year. The stock fell as much as 14
percent, the most in more than three years.  “We are looking at the potential closure and
rationalization of some of our smaller plants,” Robertshaw said
in a telephone interview. He would not name the facilities,
mainly in  Europe , because employees still need to be consulted.  Work will be moved into larger facilities and to existing,
lower-cost sites, he said. Closing decisions, which will cost
about 15 million pounds, will be taken in the next 3 to 4 months
and should yield a 7 million pounds to 8 million pound reduction
in the annual cost base, Robertshaw said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
