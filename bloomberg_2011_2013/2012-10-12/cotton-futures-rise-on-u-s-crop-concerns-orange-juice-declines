Cotton gained the most in more than
three weeks on signs that hot, dry weather eroded crop quality
in the U.S., the world’s top exporter. Orange juice slid.  For the season started Aug. 1, 46 percent of harvested
cotton has met the standards needed to be delivered against
futures traded in  New York , a unit of the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said in a  report  today. That’s below a historical
average of about 70 percent, according to Peter Egli, a Chicago-
based director of risk-management for Plexus Cotton Ltd. Plants
are producing coarse fiber in growing areas including  Texas , the
biggest producer, he said.  “The extreme heat and drought this summer have taken a
toll on fiber characteristics,” Egli said in an e-mailed
report. “We believe that this low percentage of tenderable
grades has traders nervous” that there won’t be enough supplies
to rebuild inventories, he said.  Cotton for December delivery rose 0.9 percent to settle at
71.36 cents a pound at 2:31 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the biggest advance since Sept. 18.  Orange-juice  futures for November delivery retreated 0.9
percent to $1.126 a pound. This week, the commodity sank 2.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
