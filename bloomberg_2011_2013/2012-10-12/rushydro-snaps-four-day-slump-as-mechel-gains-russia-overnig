Russian shares traded in New York
rose for the first time in five days and  OAO RusHydro (RSHYY)  rebounded
as analysts speculated a yearlong dispute over its investment
program is ending.  American depositary receipts of  Russia ’s biggest renewable
energy producer climbed 1.9 percent to $2.66 yesterday after
shares in Moscow added 0.7 percent.  OAO Mechel (MTL)  rallied the most
in a month. The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-
traded Russian companies in New York added 0.4 percent to 98.12
yesterday while  RTS stock-index futures  expiring in December
fell.  RusHydro called yesterday a general shareholders’  meeting
 for Nov. 16 to approve a capital increase that will help with
its $12.3 billion expansion program through 2016. Shareholders
had disagreed on whether Russia should boost its stake in the
company and pump money or allow state-owned OAO Rosneftegaz to
obtain a stake in the producer. The government had frozen power
tariffs for 18 months to July, reducing RusHydro’s revenue.  “The shareholders’ meeting announcement today signals this
whole drama is nearing the end, which is highly appreciated by
the market,” Sergey Beiden, an analyst at Otkritie Financial
Corp. in Moscow, said by phone yesterday. “We are very near the
final decisions and that is big progress.”  ‘Surely Suffer’  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.-traded
exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, rose 0.7 percent
to $28.89 yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index slid 0.1 percent
to 28.99.  U.S. Labor Department reported yesterday that claims for
 jobless benefits  fell to 339,000 last week, the lowest level
since February 2008.  China’s biggest banks are resisting government pressure to
lower borrowing costs amid an economic slowdown as they seek to
maintain the profitability of their lending operations,
officials at the top four lenders said.  Futures on the dollar-denominated RTS Index fell 0.5
percent to 147,760.  “As people analyze the latest claims figure there is a
question of how sustainable it is,” Ilya Kravets, who helps
manage $100 million of investments at ED Capital, said by e-mail
from New York yesterday. “ China  may not be able to reaccelerate
growth as some have expected. In this case, Russia would surely
suffer as one of the major global commodity exporters.”  Investment Program  RusHydro needs the cash to expand its production facilities
throughout the country. The company plans to invest  98.3 billion
rubles  ($3.2 billion) for development of its production
facilities in 2012, RusHydro said on its website. It plans to
invest a total of 381.8 billion rubles through 2016.  The government  owned  60.5 percent of the company as of June
30 according to RusHydro’s website. Instead of allowing state-
controlled Rosneftegaz to buy a stake in RusHydro, Russia will
use dividends it will receive from Rosneftegaz to help finance
RusHydro’s investment program, Economy Minister Andrei Belousov
said in Moscow on Oct. 10.  “The market expects the value of the company will increase
as the government will buy RusHydro’s new shares with a premium
to the market price,” Beiden said.  RusHydro settled at 84.97 kopeks, or 2.7 U.S. cents, in
Moscow yesterday.  Oil, which together with natural gas accounted for half of
state budget revenue in 2011, rose 0.9 percent to $92.07 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices are up 7.3
percent from a year earlier.  Brent oil for November settlement climbed 1.2 percent to
$115.71 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, gained 1.8
percent to $114.58 a barrel yesterday.  Foreign Stock Futures  The Moscow Exchange may start trading foreign stock futures
next year and is planning to expand foreign currency futures
trading, Roman Sulzhik, managing director of Moscow Exchange’s
derivatives market said by e-mail yesterday.  “Right now the Moscow Exchange is developing the
parameters for trading foreign stock futures,” he said. “The
launch decision may be taken in early 2013.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities climbed
to the highest level in three weeks, adding 1.1 percent to
671.84.  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s biggest producer of coal for steelmakers,
surged 4.6 percent to $7.04 in New York. The ADRs settled at a
1.9 percent premium to the company’s Moscow-traded shares, the
most since Sept. 26. The stock rose 0.8 percent to 214.50
rubles, or $6.9, in Moscow yesterday.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world’s biggest producer of the
metal, gained 0.8 percent to $15.54. The company’s shares traded
on the Micex Index advanced 0.2 percent to 4,831 rubles, or

rose for the first time in five days, adding 1.4 percent to
HK$4.38 as of 1:10 p.m. in Hong Kong trading. The MSCI Asia
