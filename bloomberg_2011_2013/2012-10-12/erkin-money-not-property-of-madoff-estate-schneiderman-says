New York  Attorney General Eric
Schneiderman said the $415 million that former Bernard Madoff
investor J. Ezra Merkin will pay under a settlement to
compensate investors in three hedge funds he managed isn’t
“property” of the con man’s estate, as claimed by the trustee
liquidating the estate.  Asking U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff to take the case, the
state’s highest law enforcement official said it would be
“unprecedented” for a federal court to stop the settlement of
claims by a state law enforcement agency against parties who
aren’t trying to take money from a bankrupt entity, “on the
ground that the settlement might make it difficult for the
trustee to collect a judgment he hopes to obtain someday.”  Madoff trustee  Irving Picard  sued Schneiderman, saying he
was making an “end run” around bankruptcy law and the Merkin
deal should be stopped because Picard was pursuing similar
claims  against the former money manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
