American Airlines expanded the use
of extra seat clamps to 49  Boeing Co. (BA)  767s as a “precautionary
measure” after determining that the planes have the same locks
as those that came loose in flights on another type of jet.  There haven’t been any “in-flight” incidents affecting
customers on the 767 planes and no flights will need to be
canceled,  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s American said in an e-mailed statement
today. The extra clamps have the same strength as the ones put
on seats for 48 of the company’s 757 jets, and the work will be
completed by around Oct. 21.  American, based in  Fort Worth , Texas, has inspected its
entire fleet, it said today, after seat rows in the coach
sections of its 757s became wobbly on three flights from Sept.
26 through Oct. 1. Seats were loose enough to shift backward
toward the next row, although they never came completely free
from the floor, the company has said.  The loose seats have added to the bankrupt carrier’s
problem with flight delays, which have caused a 1 percent
reduction of capacity that will last through the first two weeks
of November. The delays occurred after the airline imposed
concessions on pilots and began notifying mechanics of layoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
