MAN SE (MAN) , the truckmaker controlled by
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) , said next year will be even tougher than 2012 as
orders in the third quarter slumped more than normal.  The decline in third-quarter business was stronger than
seasonal patterns, Chief Financial Officer Frank Lutz said today
at an analyst meeting in Nuremberg. Stefan Straub, a spokesman
for the Munich-based company, confirmed the comments.  MAN reaffirmed its 2012 earnings forecast, which was
lowered in July as weaker demand in  Brazil  added to woes in
Europe. The German truckmaker said at the time that it expects
its profit margin to decline to about 6 percent of sales,
compared with a previous target of 8.5 percent. Operating profit
in the second quarter tumbled 50 percent to 218 million euros
($283 million), as Europe’s debt crisis sapped truck demand.  “MAN’s focus on Europe and  South America  is difficult,”
said  Juergen Pieper , an analyst at Bankhaus Metzler in
Frankfurt. “The European truck market will certainly drop more
and sales in South America are only gradually improving,”
making a clear “sell case” for the stock.  MAN shares  dropped  as much as 2.72 euros, or 3.5 percent,
to 74.85 euros and traded 1.8 percent lower as of 12:34 p.m. in
Frankfurt. The stock has advanced 9 percent this year, valuing
the truckmaker at 11.2 billion euros.  Other European truckmakers also fell.  Scania AB (SCVB)  dropped as
much as 1.3 percent to 117.40 kronor and  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  fell as much
as 1 percent to 91.10 kronor in Stockholm.  Demand Drop  Deliveries of heavy-duty vehicles are forecast to fall 4
percent in western Europe this year, according to the German
industry association VDA. MAN is in the process of integrating
its truck operations with Sweden’s Scania, also controlled by
VW, in an attempt to cut costs.  European heavy truck sales declined 9.1 percent in August
to 14,436 vehicles, according to data from industry group ACEA.
Eight-month deliveries dropped 6.3 percent to 148,531 trucks.  Truckmakers have cut production in response to the
slowdown.  Daimler AG (DAI) , Europe’s biggest commercial-vehicle maker,
plans to halt production at its truck factory in Woerth,
Germany, for four days in October. Scania has let contracts
lapse for most of its 1,400 temporary workers in Europe as
demand has weakened.  MAN announced a hiring freeze to counter flagging truck
sales in Europe when it reported second-quarter results in July.
The company in late August said it may eliminate additional
temporary staff and cut production shifts after demand for heavy
vehicles declined this summer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
