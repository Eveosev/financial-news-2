South African white corn rose for
the first time in five days after a U.S. government report
predicted world inventories will drop more than expected after
the worst drought in more than 50 years cuts output.  White corn for December delivery, the most active contract,
added 1.9 percent to 2,520 rand ($294) a metric ton by the close
in Johannesburg. Yellow corn for delivery in the same month
climbed for a second day, rising 1.6 percent to 2,538 rand.  Worldwide inventories on Oct. 1 will be 117.27 million
metric tons, down from 123.95 million predicted a month ago and
131.54 million estimated this year, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said yesterday. Reserves as a percent of consumption
will fall to the lowest since 1974, USDA data show. Stockpiles
in the U.S., the largest grower and exporter, will fall 37
percent from last year to 15.7 million tons.  “Yields and stocks will be low, that is why our corn
prices are up today,” Theo Venter, an analyst at Klerksdorp,
South Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by phone.  South African wheat increased 0.1 percent to 3,565 rand a
ton after a three-day drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
