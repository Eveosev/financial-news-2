China ’s stocks fell, erasing earlier
gains, on concern high borrowing costs may hurt efforts to
revive growth in the world’s second-biggest economy.  Jiangxi Copper Co. led a decline for metal producers after
a Bloombery survey of analysts found copper traders are the most
bearish in four months on mounting concern that demand for
industrial metals will weaken as growth slows. China’s biggest
banks are resisting government pressure to lower borrowing costs
amid an economic slowdown as they seek to maintain the
profitability of their lending operations, officials at the top
four lenders said.  “There’s still a lack of confidence so any gains is always
short-lived,” said Zhou Lin, an analyst at Huatai Securities
Co. in a telephone interview in Nanjing. “Investors need
concrete evidence from economic data that we have reached a
bottom. I don’t see that happening this year. And it seems hard
to find an effective policy to boost the growth.”  The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.2 percent to
2,097.79 at 11:25 a.m. local time, erasing a gain of as much as
1.2 percent. The CSI 300 Index lost 0.4 percent to 2,293.34.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
