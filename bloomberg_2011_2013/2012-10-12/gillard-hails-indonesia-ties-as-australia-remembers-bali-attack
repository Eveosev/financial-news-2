Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  visited the Indonesian island of Bali today to mark the
10th anniversary of nightclub bombings that killed 202 people
amid concerns that terrorists would target the event.  The attacks, which killed 88 Australians, brought the two
countries closer than ever before, Gillard said, according to
prepared remarks distributed to reporters.  Indonesia  and
 Australia  worked together to rescue and heal the victims and
dismantle the terrorist network responsible, she said.  “There is a grim reassurance in knowing that the
terrorists did not achieve what they set out to do,” Gillard
said. “They did not undermine Indonesian democracy, which has
only grown stronger across the passage of a decade.”  Indonesia deployed about 2,400 security personnel to secure
today’s memorial service after indications of a threat, National
police spokesman Boy Rafli Amar said yesterday. In the past few
years, police killed the alleged masterminds of the attack,
Noordin Top and Dulmatin, who were both tied to Jemaah
Islamiyah, an al-Qaeda linked group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
