Corn fell from a three-week high and
soybeans declined after a government report showed slowing
demand for supplies from the U.S., the world’s biggest grower
and exporter.  In the week ended Oct. 7, exporters sold 4,232 metric tons
of  corn  for delivery before Aug. 31 compared with 1.26 million a
year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today.
Sales in the past four weeks were 89 percent below the same
period in 2011.  South Korea ’s Nonghyup Feed Group canceled a
tender for 210,000 tons of corn overnight. Soybean sales last
week fell to 500,657 tons, less than half the week-earlier total
and down 26 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said.  “Corn sales were extremely disappointing, suggesting
overseas buyers are shopping for cheaper alternatives,”  Jerry Gidel , the chief feed grain analyst for Rice Dairy LLC in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Soybean demand slowed
as it appears buyers are expecting record crops in  South America 
to depress U.S. prices.”  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 2.7 percent to
close at $7.5275 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest decline since Sept. 17. Yesterday, after the
USDA forecast the tightest world inventories since 2007 because
of the worst domestic drought since 1956, the price jumped to
$7.76, the highest since Sept. 17.  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 1.7 percent to
$15.225 a bushel on the CBOT, capping the first four-week
decline since June. The price reached a record $17.89 on Sept.
4.  Corn and soybeans also fell on speculation that rain during
the past two weeks and more forecast next week will improve soil
moisture for planting and earlier development of both crops in
South America, Gidel said. The USDA said yesterday that soybean
production in Brazil and  Argentina , the biggest exporters after
the U.S., will rise 26 percent to a record this year.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
