Wheat fell the most in more than
three weeks as an unexpected drop in U.S. exports dimmed
prospects for demand after a drought-fueled price surge since
mid-June.  Export  sales  totaled 279,877 metric tons in the week that
ended on Oct. 4, down 8.8 percent from a week earlier, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a report. That’s less
than the 400,000 to 625,000 forecast by analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. Accumulated exports since June 1 are down 9 percent from
the same period a year earlier, USDA data show. Prices are up 37
percent since June 15.  “Export sales were a little under trade expectations,”
 Tomm Pfitzenmaier , a partner at Summit Commodity Brokerage in
 Des Moines ,  Iowa , said by telephone. U.S. grain is still
“overpriced” compared with wheat from Russia, Ukraine and the
European Union, he said.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 3.3 percent to
settle at $8.5675 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest decline since Sept. 17. The price was little
changed this week, dropping 0.1 percent.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
