Patty was downgraded to a depression
from a tropical storm as a second system threatened to form in
the eastern  Caribbean Sea , according to the U.S. National
Hurricane Center.  Patty’s top winds dropped to 35 miles (56 kilometers) per
hour in the Atlantic about 265 miles east-northeast of the
central Bahamas, according to a 4:30 p.m. hurricane center
advisory. The storm, which formed yesterday, may break up by
tomorrow, the statement said.  Farther to the southeast, the center is tracking a system
that has a 90 percent chance of becoming the season’s 17th storm
within the next two days. It would be named Rafael and may
become a tropical storm as early as tonight, the center said.  “If a tropical storm forms, warnings would be needed for
portions of the Lesser Antilles and the Virgin Islands,”
according to a hurricane center bulletin at 5 p.m.  Sixteen storms have formed in the Atlantic this year,
making it the fifth-most-active season and tying it with 2008,
2003 and 1936, according to  Weather Underground  in  Ann Arbor ,
 Michigan . The basin has also exceeded early seasonal predictions
from both the U.S.  Climate Prediction Center  and  Colorado State
University .  The most active season was 2005, which produced 28 storms
including  Hurricane Katrina .  The U.S. predicted nine to 15 storms and Colorado State
researchers called for 13 during the season that runs from June
1 to Nov. 30.  Patty, which is stationary, is being torn apart by wind
shear, the hurricane center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
