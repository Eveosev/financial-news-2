Wisconsin Representative  Paul Ryan 
won tonight’s debate with Vice President  Joe Biden , according to
a  CNN /ORC International poll of 381 registered voters who
watched the nationally televised event.  Forty-eight percent of those surveyed said Ryan fared
better in the vice-presidential debate, compared with 44 percent
for Biden, according to results aired on CNN after the event
concluded. The results were within the survey’s five-percentage-
point margin of error.  Biden was declared the winner over Ryan by 50 percent to 31
percent in a poll of 431 uncommitted voters conducted by CBS
News/GfK after the debate. Fifty-six percent thought Biden would
be an effective president if necessary, compared with 49 percent
for Ryan, according to the CBS poll.  Tonight’s showdown in Danville, Kentucky, gained added
significance after a majority of voters said President  Barack Obama  lost to Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  in their first
debate on Oct. 3. Romney has since gained in national and state
polls.  The two presidential candidates will meet in two more
debates later this month.  Sixty-seven percent of those surveyed by CNN after the Oct.
3 debate said Romney fared better, compared with 25 percent for
Obama, according to results aired on CNN after it concluded.
Forty-six percent said they found Romney more likeable, compared
with 45 percent for Obama, CNN reported.  The CNN post-debate poll on Oct. 3 interviewed 430
Americans and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
