The forint gained and the cost to
protect against a default by  Hungary  fell to a 14-month low
after Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said Hungary isn’t far from a
“good” agreement with the  International Monetary Fund  on aid.  The currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 281.45 per euro by
12:07 p.m. in Budapest, extending this week’s advance to 0.6
percent. Credit-default swaps slid three basis points to 300,
the lowest since July 2011. Yields on the government’s benchmark
10-year bonds basis dropped 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage
point, to 6.92 percent.  There is a “good chance” for an agreement with the
Washington-based lender, which is aimed at reducing Hungary’s
financing costs, Orban said today in an interview with state-run
MR1 radio. The aid talks have dragged on for almost a year as
the government insists on a precautionary  credit line  that
doesn’t carry the same conditions attached to an IMF standby
loan, government spokesman Andras Giro-Szasz told TV2.  “Hungary’s improving risk perception is mainly to do with
the points of view closing in on an agreement,” Imre Kerekgyarto, a Budapest-based trader at Commerzbank AG, wrote in
an e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
