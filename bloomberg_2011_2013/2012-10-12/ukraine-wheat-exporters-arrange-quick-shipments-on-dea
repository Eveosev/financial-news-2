Ukraine’s wheat exporters are
arranging “quick shipments” after the government agreed with
traders that exports of the cereal should be limited to 5
million metric tons in the marketing year that began July 1,
UkrAgroConsult said.  Ukraine’s Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said
yesterday that the government and traders approved raising the
limit from the 4 million tons set a month ago, the Kiev-based
agriculture researcher said today in e-mailed statement.  The country exported 343,000 tons of wheat in the first
week of October, UkrAgroConsult said yesterday. Another 775,000
tons are ready to be shipped from ports in the near future, the
researcher said. Wheat exports reached 3 million tons from
July 1 through Oct. 9, UkrAgroConsult said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
