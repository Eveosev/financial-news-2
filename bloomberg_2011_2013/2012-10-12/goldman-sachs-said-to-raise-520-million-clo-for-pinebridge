Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  raised a
$520 million collateralized loan obligation for PineBridge
Investments LLC, according to two people with knowledge of the
deal.  The fund, Galaxy XIV CLO, includes a $318.75 million slice
rated AAA that pays a rate of 143 basis points more than the
London interbank offered rate, said the people, who declined to
be identified because the terms are private. Libor is the rate
at which banks say they can borrow in dollars from each other.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  This is the second CLO PineBridge has issued this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley arranged
a $412.5 million fund for the firm in March.  There have been $32 billion of CLOs backed by widely
syndicated loans raised in the U.S. this year, an increase from
$11.7 billion in all of 2011, according to Bloomberg data.  Michael DuVally , a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
