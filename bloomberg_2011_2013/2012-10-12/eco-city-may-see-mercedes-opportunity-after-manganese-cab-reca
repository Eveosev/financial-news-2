Eco City Vehicles Plc (ECV) , which
supplies the Mercedes Vito to London taxi drivers, will seek to
exploit opportunities after competitor Manganese Bronze Holdings
Plc recalled 400 cabs and suspended trading of new models.  “The main priority for me is to preserve our market share
and to take advantage should advantage present itself,” Peter DaCosta, chief financial officer of London-based Eco City, said
in a phone interview today. “If opportunity presents itself, I
want my shareholders to benefit from it.”  Eco City will evaluate the repercussions of the recall
before deciding whether to increase advertising efforts, DaCosta
said. Eco City’s sales increased 116 percent to 324 vehicles in
the first half.  Manganese, the biggest supplier of London black cabs,
recalled the vehicles because of a fault in the steering box,
which has been provided by a new supplier since February, the
Coventry, England-based company said in a statement today,
without identifying the supplier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
