The ruble dropped for the first day
in three against the dollar as oil,  Russia ’s chief export
earner, declined.  The ruble fell less than 0.1 percent to 31.0300 against the
dollar by 7 p.m. in Moscow, taking the weekly drop to 0.5
percent. The Russian currency was little changed versus the euro
at 40.2400 and at 35.1745 against the central bank’s euro-dollar
target basket.  Brent declined 0.9 percent to $114.67 a barrel in London by
the close of ruble trading after the  International Energy Agency 
cut its forecast for global demand by 100,000 barrels a day from
a month ago. Oil and gas accounts for about 50 percent of
Russia’s government revenue.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.4881 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.5125 yesterday.  An index of five-year government bond yields compiled by
the Micex fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percent, to 7.278
percent. The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell three basis points 186,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
