Canadian oils weakened before a
planned shutdown at  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting refinery in  Indiana .  The 420,000-barrel-a-day plant will shut its largest crude
unit for planned work on Nov. 1, a person familiar with
operations at the plant said April 19. The London-based company
plans to move heavy equipment to the plant on Nov. 4 or Nov. 11
Bob Kark, economic development director for the city of Whiting,
said in a telephone interview.  November Syncrude’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
narrowed 60 cents to $3.90 a barrel at 3:21 p.m. in  New York ,
according to  Net Energy Inc ., a Calgary-based oil brokerage.
Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI widened 35 cents to $15
a barrel.  Prices also weakened on the U.S. Gulf Coast as the
differential for WTI compared with North Sea Brent narrowed.  The  difference  between the benchmarks decreased 88 cents to
$22.76 a barrel in New York. When Brent falls at a faster pace
than WTI, as it did today, it typically weakens the value of
U.S. grades competing with foreign oils priced against the
European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 50 cents to $21.20
a barrel over WTI, according to data compiled by Bloomberg at
4:12 p.m. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium lost 30 cents to $21 a
barrel.  Poseidon’s premium narrowed 45 cents to $13.80. Mars Blend
decreased by 10 cents to $14.90 a barrel over WTI, and Southern
Green Canyon lost 5 cents to $13.40.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
narrowed 25 cents to $19.25 above WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
