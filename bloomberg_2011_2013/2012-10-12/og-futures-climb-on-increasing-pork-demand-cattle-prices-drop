Hog futures rose for the third day
this week on signs of increasing U.S. demand for pork. Cattle
prices fell.  Wholesale  pork  rose 1.2 percent to 87.69 cents a pound
yesterday, the highest since Aug. 21, and prices are up 16
percent from a 22-month low on Sept. 19, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Yesterday,  hogs  for immediate delivery to
slaughterhouses rose 0.4 percent to 79.33 cents a pound, and
prices are up 1.3 percent this year, according to the USDA.  “We have been able to move pork,”  Don Roose , the
president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa ,
said in a telephone interview. “We have been able to make
money. We’ve been eating through the large supply.”  Hog futures for December settlement rose 1.1 percent to
settle at 78.375 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the  Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange. Prices advanced 2.4 percent this week, the
second straight gain.  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 0.3 percent to
settle at $1.255 a pound in Chicago. Prices are up 3.3 percent
this year.  Meatpackers processed 613,000 head of cattle in the first
five days of this week, up 1 percent from a week earlier, USDA
data show.  “With the scarcity of feed, you’re going to see this
continued culling as we work our way into the fall,” Mike
North, a senior risk-management adviser at First Capitol Ag in
Platteville,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone interview. “We
could see more animals working their way to the market in the
next several weeks, and that could provide some pressure to
price.”  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement advanced 0.3
percent to $1.44225 a pound in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
