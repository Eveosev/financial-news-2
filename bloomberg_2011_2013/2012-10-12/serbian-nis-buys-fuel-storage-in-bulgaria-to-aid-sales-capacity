Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) , the
Serbian oil and gas company controlled by  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) ,
bought a fuel storage site in neighboring  Bulgaria  as it seeks 
to boost sales and capacity.  The 25,500 cubic meter-facility in Kostinbrod, northwest of
Bulgaria’s capital Sofia, will be used for storing, blending and
distributing gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, ethanol and liquefied
natural gas, the Novi Sad-based refiner said today in an e-
mailed statement. The seller nor the price of the acquisition
wasn’t disclosed.  The storage will be fully operational by the end of the
month, the company said.  NIS plans “a significant increase” of storage capacity in
Bulgaria over the next three years, as part of the development
of its retail network in the region, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
