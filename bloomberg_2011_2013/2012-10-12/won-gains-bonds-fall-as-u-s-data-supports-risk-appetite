South Korea’s won appreciated and
 government bonds  declined for a second day as data showed
jobless claims in the U.S. fell to a four-year low, supporting
demand for riskier assets.  Applications for unemployment benefit in the world’s
largest economy dropped to 339,000 in the week ended Oct. 6, the
fewest since February 2008, official figures showed yesterday.
Singapore’s central bank unexpectedly kept its monetary policy
stance today, saying it’s appropriate to contain inflation and
ensure economic growth as the republic reported gross domestic
product contracted last quarter.  “The U.S. jobs data and Singapore refraining from easing
contributed to a weakening of the dollar against Asian
currencies,” said Lee Jung Hyun, a Seoul-based currency trader
at Industrial Bank of  Korea .  The won appreciated 0.3 percent to 1,111.30 per dollar at
the close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency was little changed for the week. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, slipped 38 basis points, or 0.38 percentage point, to
5.88 percent today.  The  Bank of Korea  lowered the benchmark interest  rate  for
the second time this year to 2.75 percent yesterday, while
revising its 2012 economic growth forecast lower to 2.4 percent
from a July estimate of 3 percent.  The yield on the 2.75 percent notes due September 2017
climbed one basis point to 2.82 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. The rate was unchanged for the week. The one-year
 interest-rate  swap held at 2.77 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
