Azerbaijan’s inflation accelerated
to 1.5 percent in the first nine months from a year earlier as
food, non-food and service prices rose, the State Statistics
Committee said on its  website  today.  The Caspian Sea nation’s inflation rate was 7.9 percent
last year. The central bank expects consumer-price growth will
remain below 10 percent this year as well.  To contact the reporter on this story:
