Philippine 25-year bonds had their
first weekly gain in a month as speculation of further monetary
easing helped shore up demand for an offering of debt targeted
at individuals. The peso snapped a two-day decline.  The government sold 127 billion pesos ($3 billion) of the
6.125 percent notes due 2037 that are on sale until Oct. 22, and
bids so far total 200 billion pesos, Deputy Treasurer Eduardo
Mendiola said in an interview today. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
has room to lower borrowing costs this year, Governor Amando
Tetangco said in  Tokyo  this week.  “Expectations of another rate cut and the general view
that the government is efficiently managing the economy are
making the retail bonds very attractive,” said Roland Avante,
president of Philippine Business Bank in Manila.  The yield on the 5.75 percent securities due August 2037
fell 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 6.14 percent,
according to midday fixing prices at Philippine Dealing &
Exchange Corp. The weekly drop is the biggest since the notes
were issued in August. The rate declined one basis point today
to the lowest level in more than a week.  Bangko Sentral reduced its overnight borrowing rate three
times this year, most recently trimming it to a record-low 3.75
percent in July. The central bank’s remaining policy meetings
for this year are due on Oct. 25 and Dec. 13.  The peso rose 0.4 percent to 41.43 per dollar at the close
in  Manila , according to prices from Tullett Prebon Plc. It was
little changed from 41.427 on Oct. 5. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was unchanged at 5.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
