Torrential rain hit parts of
 Scotland  overnight, with lingering downpours causing road
closures and widespread disruption to transport.  The  Met Office  issued an amber warning in the east of the
country, meaning people should be prepared for further
inundation and dangerous conditions. Surface water is affecting
drivers across Scotland and the A92 has been shut between Dundee
and Arbroath, according to the Traffic Scotland  website .  There is potential for almost a month’s average rainfall
over a 24 to 48-hour period, with about 8 centimeters (3.1
inches) possible in some areas, Transport Scotland said in an e-
mailed statement.  “Just weeks after the first major storm of the autumn, the
transport network is braced for another major challenge,”
Transport Minister  Keith Brown  said in the statement.  The  Scottish Environment Protection Agency  said there is an
increasing risk of flooding in northeast Scotland into tomorrow.
The agency has flood warnings in place for Dundee and Angus,
Scottish Borders and Tayside as well as Aberdeenshire, Ayrshire
and Arran, Sutherland, Dumfries and Galloway, Edinburgh and the
Lothians, Fife and West Central Scotland.  “We are currently expecting the worst of any flooding
impacts to be focused in the Aberdeenshire area later on Friday
and into Saturday,”  Richard Brown , head of hydrology for the
agency, said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
