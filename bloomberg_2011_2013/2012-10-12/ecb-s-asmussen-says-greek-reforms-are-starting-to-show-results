European Central Bank Executive
Board Member Joerg Asmussen said  Greece ’s government has made
progress and reforms are beginning to show positive results.  “A lot has been done by the Greek authorities in the last
two years -- the primary deficit has been reduced,” Asmussen
said in a speech in  Tokyo  today. “Labour-market reforms are
beginning to show positive results.”  Asmussen said the ECB is “seeing encouraging signs that
the fiscal targets for next year can be met.” The best way out
of its crisis for the euro area is “for Greece to reform within
the euro area,” he said.  Speaking about the European Stability Mechanism, Asmussen
said that “few would have predicted, in early 2010, that we
would today have an international treaty ensuring balanced
budgets and a permanent rescue fund of 500 billion euros” ($649
billion). At the same time, “to fully restore confidence in the
euro area, we also need to fix the flaws in its institutional
architecture,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
