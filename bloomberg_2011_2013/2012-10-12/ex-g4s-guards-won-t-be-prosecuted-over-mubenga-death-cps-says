A  G4S Plc (GFS)  unit and three security
guards won’t be prosecuted in the U.K. over the death of Jimmy
Mubenga, the Crown Prosecution Service said today.  The CPS said today’s statement was the same as it released
in July and an administrative error led to it being republished
on its website.  G4S declined to comment today beyond the statement the
company put out in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
