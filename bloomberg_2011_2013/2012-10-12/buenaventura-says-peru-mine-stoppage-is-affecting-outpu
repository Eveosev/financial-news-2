Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SAA ,
 Peru ’s biggest precious metals producer, said the Orcopampa gold
mine’s fifth strike this year is reducing output.  Contract workers downed tools as part of annual talks,
Buenaventura said today in an e-mailed statement. The stoppage
at Orcopampa, the company’s largest wholly owned gold mine,
started to affect production on Oct. 9. Orcopampa produced
285,201 ounces of gold last year. The company didn’t say how
much output was affected by the strike.  “Negotiations are progressing and the company believes
that this issue can be solved in short order,” Buenaventura
said in the statement. “The company will keep the market
updated with regards to any developments or changes as they
occur.”  Workers in Peru,  Bolivia  and  Chile  have held work stoppages
at copper, gold and zinc mines this year to seek a bigger
percentage of company earnings. Shougang Hierro Peru SAA began a
strike Oct. 9.  Buenaventura Chief Financial Officer Carlos Galvez and the
company’s labor negotiator, Miguel Angel de la Flor, weren’t
available to comment when called by Bloomberg News.  Buenaventura’s  American depositary receipts  fell 1.4
percent to $36.81 at 3:56 p.m. in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
