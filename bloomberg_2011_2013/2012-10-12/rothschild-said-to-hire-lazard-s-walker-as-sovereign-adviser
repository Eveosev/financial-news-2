Rothschild, a family-run bank, hired
 Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) ’s former senior adviser Mark Walker, who worked with 
Greece on debt restructuring, three people with knowledge of the 
matter said.  Walker joined Rothschild in London last month to work on
sovereign debt for government clients, said the people, who
declined to be named because they aren’t authorised to speak to
the press on the matter. Richard Creswell, a London-based
spokesman for Lazard, and a Rothschild spokesman in Paris
declined to comment.  Lazard hired Walker to its government advisory unit in
Paris last year. He was previously managing partner at New York-
based law firm  Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP , working on
debt negotiations for five decades, including in Mexico during
the Latin American crisis of the early 1980’s.  Before  moving to Lazard , Walker also worked with the  New
York  Federal Reserve and the  U.S. Treasury  on how to deal with
the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Lazard said in a
statement in June last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
