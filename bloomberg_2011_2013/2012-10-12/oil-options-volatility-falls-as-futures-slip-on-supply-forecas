Crude oil options volatility
declined for the first time this week as underlying futures were
little changed.  Implied volatility for options expiring in December, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 30.87 percent at 3:10 p.m. in  New York ,
after being at 32.35 percent the previous day.  December-delivery crude oil declined 22 cents to settle at
$92.28 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The most active options in electronic trading today were
November $95 calls, or bets that prices will rise, which fell 17
cents to 23 cents a barrel at 3:34 p.m. with 1,666 lots trading.
November $90 puts were the second-most active, with 1,329 lots
exchanged as they declined 13 cents to 46 cents a barrel.  Bullish bets accounted for 55 percent of the 25,038
contracts in electronic trading. One contract covers 1,000
barrels of oil.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bets that prices would rise made
up 54 percent of the 83,235 contracts traded.  November $90 puts were the most actively traded options
yestereday with 3,347 lots changing hands. They fell 47 cents to
59 cents a barrel. December $85 puts declined 18 cents to $1.12
on volume of 3,047 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
67,784 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 50,859 lots
and December $125 calls with 44,933.  To contact the reporter on this story:
