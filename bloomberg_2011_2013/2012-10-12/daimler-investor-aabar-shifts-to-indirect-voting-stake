Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s third-
biggest luxury-car manufacturer, said the  Abu Dhabi  investors
that formed its largest shareholding group sold their  voting
rights  in the automaker.  Aabar Investments PJSC and partners, including
International Petroleum Investment Co. and the government of Abu
Dhabi, disposed of their holdings on Oct. 5, Stuttgart, Germany-
based Daimler said in a statement after the market closed
yesterday. The partners still hold 12.75 percent voting rights
indirectly, Florian Martens, a spokesman at the carmaker, said
today.  Daimler “respects” the shift in shareholdings, and
nothing else has changed in its ties with Aabar, Martens said.
Aabar didn’t immediately respond to requests for comments during
the weekly Friday day off in the Persian Gulf.  Aabar, which bought stock in Daimler for 1.95 billion euros
($2.52 billion) in 2009, lent about half its holdings a year ago
to an unidentified recipient, saying at the time that it
remained “fully committed” to the carmaker. Since then, an
investment firm affiliated with Daimler has shifted stock in
U.S. electric-car manufacturer Tesla Motors Inc. to Aabar.  Daimler, Aabar and the Algerian government signed a
memorandum of understanding in March 2011 to build trucks and
buses in the North African country. Aabar also holds a stake in
the Formula One racing team owned by Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz car
brand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
