U.S. stocks  had the biggest weekly
retreat since June as the  International Monetary Fund  reduced
its global growth forecasts and projections from  Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. (AMD)  and  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  disappointed investors.  All  10 industry groups  in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
fell for the week. Technology companies slumped 2.9 percent as
AMD cut its sales forecast and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  had its longest string
of weekly losses since July.  Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR)  led consumer-
discretionary shares to a 2.9 percent drop after saying revenue
will be at the low end of its estimate. Alcoa slid 4.4 percent
after trimming its global aluminum outlook while  Wells Fargo &
Co. (WFC)  sank 4.4 percent amid narrower profit margins.  The S&P 500 tumbled 2.2 percent to 1,428.59 for the week.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 281.30 points, or 2.1
percent, to 13,328.85. Both gauges had their biggest weekly
retreat since June 1.  “We’re in this quarterly period of maximum uncertainty,”
 Dan Veru , who oversees $3.5 billion as chief investment officer
at Palisade Capital Management LLC in Fort Lee, New Jersey, said
in a phone interview. “Earnings haven’t started in earnest yet,
but the companies that have bad news to report are putting their
news out. We’re just early in the process and that makes it
tricky. I’m trying not to read too much into it.”  Stocks fell worldwide as the IMF reduced its global growth
estimate for 2012 to 3.3 percent from 3.5 percent, the slowest
since the 2009 recession. The Washington-based lender warned of
even slower expansion unless officials in the U.S. and Europe
address threats to their economies. Economic reports during the
week showed confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly jumped
in October to the highest level since before the recession began
five years ago and jobless claims fell to the lowest since 2008.  Earnings Season  The  S&P 500  has lost 0.9 percent since Alcoa unofficially
started the earnings season with release of its third-quarter
numbers on Oct. 9. S&P 500 profits declined 0.9 percent during
the July-to-September period, the first income drop since 2009,
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  Among the 35 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far,
69 percent beat  analysts’ estimates , the data show. Profits have
exceeded their forecasts by an average 7.6 percent, more than
double the rate for the previous quarter.  The S&P 500 has rallied 14 percent this year as the Federal
Reserve announced a third round of bond buying to stimulate
economic growth and pledged to keep its target interest rates
near zero through at least mid-2015.  ‘Market Dictates’  The Fed’s action “has changed the relationship between the
economy and the stock market, and corporate earnings and the
stock market,” Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at
Milwaukee-based RW Baird & Co., which oversees $85 billion, said
in an Oct. 11 phone interview. “It should be over the long term
the economy dictates how well the stock market will do, but now
the stock market dictates how well the economy is going to do.
It means that earnings are not as significant right now as it
used to be.”  Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, fell 4.4 percent
to $8.69 for the week after reducing its 2012 forecast for
global consumption of the metal by 1 percentage point on slowing
Chinese demand. Stimulus spending may result in a pick-up in
demand from China at the end of the fourth quarter, Chief
Executive Officer  Klaus Kleinfeld  said on a conference call with
analysts.  Technology shares  in the S&P 500 tumbled the most since
May. AMD lost 15 percent to $2.74. The second-largest maker of
processors for personal computers cut its third-quarter revenue
forecast, citing weak demand across all product lines. It joins
other computer-component makers suffering fallout from sluggish
growth and a shift in consumer tastes toward mobile devices,
away from traditional desktop and laptop machines.  Apple Retreats  Apple retreated 3.5 percent to $629.71 for the third
straight weekly loss. Earnings growth at the world’s most
valuable company may slow to less than 10 percent beyond 2014 as
demand in developed markets weakens and a shift to emerging
markets may come at the cost of profit margins,  Stuart Jeffrey ,
an analyst with Nomura Holdings Inc., wrote in an Oct. 9 note to
clients. He initiated coverage with a neutral rating.  Shares of the iPhone maker have fallen 10 percent from an
all-time high of $702.10 on Sept. 19, driving the stock below
its average price in the past 50 days for the first time since
July. The shares are still up 55 percent this year.  Consumer Shares  A gauge of consumer-discretionary stocks fell 2.9 percent.
 Dollar Tree , the U.S. operator of more than 4,500 discount
stores, tumbled 14 percent to $40.11. Chief Executive Officer
Bob Sasser said third-quarter sales will be at the low end of
its forecast because of uncertainty about the U.S. presidential
election, high gas prices and long-term unemployment. The
company in August projected revenue of $1.71 billion to $1.75
billion for the period.  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  fell 5.8 percent to $59.56. The largest
U.S. home-improvement retailer was cut to market perform from
outperform at Oppenheimer & Co. The stock, which surged more
than 120 percent from a low in August 2011 through Oct. 5, is
“due for a breather,” analyst Brian Nagel wrote in an Oct. 10
note.  Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, dropped 4.4
percent to $34.25. Net interest margin, the difference between
what the bank makes on loans and pays for funds, fell by 0.25
percentage point to 3.66 percent during the third quarter, the
company said. The drop was worse than guidance from Chief
Financial Officer Timothy Sloan, who said on Sept. 11 that the
margin might narrow by about the same as last year’s 0.17
percentage point.  Shifting Balance  Phone companies fell the most in the S&P 500, sinking 4.5
percent.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  said it’s in talks to take a
“substantial” investment from Softbank Corp., Japan’s third-
largest mobile-phone company, potentially shifting the balance
of power in the U.S. telecommunications industry.  MetroPCS
Communications Inc. (PCS) , which Sprint has considered buying, slumped
6.1 percent to $11.88.  AT&T Inc. (T)  erased 5.9 percent to $35.63.
Sprint rallied 10 percent to $5.73.  Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW)  slumped 20 percent, the most in
the S&P 500, to $87.10. The maker of artificial heart valves
said third-quarter sales were lower than the company’s forecast.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  climbed 0.9 percent to a record
$75.81. The world’s largest retailer said its back-to-school
season was “very strong” and annual sales would grow as much
as 7 percent next year. Jefferies & Co. lifted the stock to buy
from hold.  Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) , owner of the Taco Bell and KFC fast-food
chains, rallied 5.2 percent to $69.45 after third-quarter profit
topped analysts’ estimates on sales gains in the U.S. and China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
