French rapeseed conditions improved
in the country’s north and northeast after rain in past days,
easing concerns about poor crop development ahead of winter,
according to industry researcher Cetiom.  “The current rainfall and mild temperatures favor the
growth of the plants,” the Paris-based researcher wrote in an
online  report  yesterday. In the Picardie, Nord-Pas-de-Calais and
Seine-Maritime regions “crop stages are varied, but the
rapeseed is moving toward a correct development before winter,”
it said.  France  is the European Union’s largest grower of the
oilseed. Rainfall in August and September was below average, and
Cetiom said rapeseed was planted in drought conditions.  In Champagne-Ardenne, plants have developed three or more
leaves in about 70 percent of rapeseed plots, compared with 40
percent last week, according to Cetiom. In Picardie, Nord-Pas-
de-Calais and Seine-Maritime, more than 75 percent of fields are
at three or more leaves, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
