Vermont  and its chief election
official were sued by the U.S. over the state’s alleged failure
to send more than 20 percent of the absentee ballots requested
by Vermont’s military and overseas voters.  The complaint, filed today by the U.S.  Justice Department 
in federal court in Vermont, seeks an order to ensure military
voters can cast their ballots in time to have their votes
counted, the department said in an e-mailed statement.  “The U.S. seeks an order requiring the state of Vermont to
ensure that military and overseas voters will have sufficient
opportunity to receive, cast and return their ballots in time to
be counted by extending the deadline until Nov. 16, 2012, for
the receipt of ballots,” the Justice Department said in the
statement.  The lawsuit was filed under the Uniformed and Overseas
Citizens Absentee Voting Act, which requires states to allow
uniformed service voters and their families as well as overseas
citizens to register to vote and to vote absentee for all
elections for federal office, according to the statement.  Vermont Secretary of State James C. Condos, who is named as
a defendant, didn’t return a phone call seeking comment on the
lawsuit after regular business hours.  The case is U.S. v. Vermont, 12-cv-00236, U.S. District
Court, District of Vermont.  To contact the reporter on this story:
