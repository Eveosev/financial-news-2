China Water Industry Group Ltd. (1129) ,
which generates more than half of its revenue from the
construction of pipelines, said a former director has been
charged by Hong Kong’s law enforcement with bribery.  Chang Kin Man, an independent non-executive director until
his resignation on Oct. 10, was charged by the Independent
Commission Against Corruption under the city’s prevention of
bribery ordinance, according to a statement today to the
Hong Kong stock exchange.  The alleged offenses against Chang don’t relate to the
company, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
