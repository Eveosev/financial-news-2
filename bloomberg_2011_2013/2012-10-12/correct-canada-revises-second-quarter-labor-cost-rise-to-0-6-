(Corrects unit labor cost figure in first paragraph.)  Canadian unit labor costs rose at a
0.6 percent pace in the second quarter, slower than the 0.7
percent rise initially reported,  Statistics Canada  said today.  Labor productivity  declined by 0.6 percent in the April-
June period, faster than the 0.4 percent drop initially
reported, the Ottawa-based agency said.  Statistics Canada published revised data today as part of
larger changes to its system of classifying the national
accounts. The revisions show productivity growth averaged 0.1
percent less in the 1981 to 2011 period than originally
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
