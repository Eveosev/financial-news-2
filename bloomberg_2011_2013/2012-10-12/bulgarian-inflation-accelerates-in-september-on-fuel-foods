Bulgarian inflation accelerated in
September on higher food and fuel prices, which increased
transport and production costs.  Consumer prices rose 4.9 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a 3.9 percent increase in August, the National
Statistics Institute in Sofia said in a statement today. The
median estimate of three economists surveyed by Bloomberg was
4.5 percent. Prices advanced 1.1 percent from the previous
month.  Bulgaria, the European Union’s poorest country in terms of
economic output per capita, withstood the global recession
without an international bailout. Producer prices rose 7.1
percent August after 4.5 percent in July.  The country’s EU-harmonized inflation will ease to 2.6
percent on average this year and to accelerate 3.4 percent in
2013, the government forecast on Oct. 3. The  International
Monetary Fund  forecast this year’s average inflation at 2.5
percent on Oct. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
