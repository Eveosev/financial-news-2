Treasuries fell as a third
government note auction this week produced poor demand after
Greek lawmakers passed the first part of an austerity plan
needed to maintain access to bailout funds.  Yields on seven-year notes rose to the highest level this
month after the $29 billion auction of the securities drew the
lowest participation from a class of investor including foreign
central banks in more than two years. Yields on two-year notes
touched 0.50 percent a day before the  Federal Reserve ’s
$600 billion second round of quantitative easing concludes.  “It looks like a disappointment,” said Gary Pollack, head
of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank AG’s private wealth
management unit in New York. “We have three auctions in a week
that have fallen below expectations. It’s not a good sign
considering QE2 ends tomorrow.”  Yields on 10-year notes increased nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 3.12 percent at 1:25 p.m. in New
York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.125
percent securities maturing in May 2021 fell 23/32, or $7.19 per
$1,000 face amount, to 100 2/32. Yields touched 3.13 percent,
the highest level since May 26.  The current seven-year note yields gained 11 basis points
to 2.41 percent after touching 2.42 percent, the highest level
since May 31. Two-year note yields were little changed at 0.47
percent today after rising to 0.50 percent, the highest level
since May 27. The yields touched 0.32 percent on June 24, within
a basis point of the all-time low of 0.3118 percent, which was
reached Nov. 4.  Seven-Year Auction  At today’s auction, the securities drew a yield of 2.430
percent, compared with the average forecast of 2.420 percent in
a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the 20 primary dealers
obliged to participate in  U.S. debt  offerings. The bid-to-cover
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with amount
of securities offered, was 2.62, compared with 3.24 last month
and an average of 2.89 at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 32.2 percent of the notes, the lowest
level since March 2009. That compares with an average of 50.1
percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealers that place their bids
directly with the Treasury, purchased 11.8 percent of the
securities, compared with 13 percent at the previous sale and an
average of 8.1 percent at the past 10 offerings.  Auction Demand  The offering is the last of three note auctions this week
totaling $99 billion. The government’s $35 billion auction of
five-year securities yesterday drew the lowest bid-to-cover
ratio in a year. A record low yield of 0.395 percent at the
$35 billion offering of two-year notes on June 27 drew the
lowest demand from indirect bidders in more than three years.  In  Greece , Prime Minister  George Papandreou  clinched enough
votes to pass the first part of an austerity plan aimed at
meeting European Union aid requirements and staving off default
for his debt-laden nation.  After gaining 155 votes in the 300-seat parliament,
Papandreou is now in a position to secure a bill setting out the
strategy for a 78 billion-euro ($112 billion) package of budget
cuts and asset sales that is the condition for further rescue
funds. The vote, overshadowed by a 48-hour strike, became the
target of protests in which police fired tear gas at
demonstrators outside the parliament.  Quarterly Return  As of yesterday, U.S. debt was headed for its largest
quarterly return in a year as a slowing economy and  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis boosted demand for the safest assets. U.S.
debt had returned 2.8 percent since the end of March, the most
since the second quarter of 2010, according to indexes compiled
by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  The number of Americans signing contracts to buy previously
owned homes rose 8.2 percent in May, the National Association of
Realtors reported. The median forecast of 36 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 3 percent gain.  “We need a constant flow of bad news to maintain yields at
these low levels,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist
at Monument Securities Ltd. in  London . “If we don’t get it,
then supply becomes a struggle.”  The central bank purchased $2.456 billion in Treasuries due
from February 2029 to February 2041 today to support the
economy. The Fed plans to purchase $4 billion to $5 billion of
notes due from December 2016 to June 2018 tomorrow as the second
round of quantitative easing ends.  Morgan Stanley Wager  Morgan Stanley, the firm targeting a 2 percent market-share
gain in fixed-income trading this year, was burned by a wager on
U.S. inflation expectations in the second quarter, three people
informed of the dealings said.  The bank’s interest-rates trading group lost at least tens
of millions of dollars on the trade, which the firm has been
unwinding, two of the people said, declining to be identified
because the transaction isn’t public. Mary Claire Delaney, a
Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, declined to comment.  Traders at the bank bet that inflation expectations for the
next five years would rise in Treasury markets, while forecasts
for the next 30 years would fall, according to two of the
people. Such wagers involve paired purchases and short sales of
Treasuries and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities in both
maturities.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and TIPS, a
gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices over the life
of the debt know as the break-even rate, increased to 2.37
percentage points, the highest level since May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
