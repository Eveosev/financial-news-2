The  University of South Carolina 
defeated the University of Florida 5-2 to repeat as college
baseball champion.  The Gamecocks won the best-of-three College World Series
final against their Southeastern Conference rival by two games
to none for their record-extending 16th straight victory in the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.  South Carolina  (55-14) is the first team to go 10-0 in an
NCAA tournament. The Gamecocks have won a record 11 straight
games in the College World Series and are the only team since
Oregon State in 2007 to claim the title without losing.  South Carolina scored three runs in the third inning at TD
Ameritrade Park in Omaha,  Nebraska , last night.  Peter Mooney crossed home plate when Scott Wingo flied out
to right field. Christian Walker reached base on a fielding
error by the shortstop that scored Evan Marzilli and Brady
Thomasâ€™s single brought Jackie Bradley Jr. home.  Mooney homered in the sixth and Wingo hit a one-run single
in the eighth to give the Gamecocks a 5-2 lead.  Mike Zunino put  Florida  on the scoreboard in the fourth
with a home run and Josh Adams drove in Zunino with a single in
the eighth.  The Gamecocks won the first game 2-1 in 11 innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
