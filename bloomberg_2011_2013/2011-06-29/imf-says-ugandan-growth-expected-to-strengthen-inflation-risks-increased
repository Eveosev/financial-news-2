Uganda ’s economic growth is expected
to strengthen and inflation risks have risen, the  International
Monetary Fund  said.  “Thanks to generally sound macroeconomic policies, Uganda
withstood the global financial crisis and other shocks,’’ the
fund said in an e-mailed statement. “Economic growth has
recovered and is expected to strengthen, although inflation
risks, mostly related to rising food prices, have increased.”  The IMF released the statement after completing the second
review under the Policy Support Instrument for Uganda. “The
board approved waivers for the nonobservance of the end-December
2010 assessment criteria on net domestic assets and net
international reserves,” the fund said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
