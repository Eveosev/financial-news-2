by  Statistics Canada .  Consumer prices rose 3.7% in the 12 months to May, the

Canada has updated the weights in the basket of goods and
services used in the calculation of the Consumer Price
Index (CPI).  These weights, as with previous updates, are based on
information derived primarily from Statistics Canada's
Survey of Household Spending. The new weighting pattern is
based on 2009 consumer expenditures and replaces the 2005
weighting pattern. The CPI's time base remains 2002=100.  For more information, refer to survey 2301,
"Documentation" at the end of this release.  The special aggregate "Energy" includes electricity;
natural gas; fuel oil and other fuels; gasoline; and fuel,
parts and supplies for recreational vehicles.  The Bank of Canada's core index excludes eight of the
Consumer Price Index's most volatile components (fruit,
fruit preparations and nuts; vegetables and vegetable
preparations; mortgage interest cost; natural gas; fuel
oil and other fuels; gasoline; inter-city transportation;
and tobacco products and smokers' supplies) as well as the
effects of changes in indirect taxes on the remaining
components.  To contact the reporter on this story:
