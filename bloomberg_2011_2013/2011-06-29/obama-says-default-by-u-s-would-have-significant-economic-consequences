President  Barack Obama  said the
consequences of the U.S. defaulting if Congress doesn’t raise
the nation’s debt ceiling will be “significant” and
unpredictable.  Aug. 2 is a “hard deadline” for when the U.S. will no
longer to meet all its debt obligations, Obama said at a White
House news conference. “We don’t know how capital markets will
react” if the deadline passes without an agreement to raise the
$14.3 trillion limit.  “The consequences for the  U.S. economy  will be
significant,” he said. “Job growth will be further stymied,
further hampered.”  Republicans and Democrats are negotiating a deal for about
$2 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years to clear the way for
an agreement to raise the nation’s borrowing limit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
