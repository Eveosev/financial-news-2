The eight teams in  Australia ’s
revamped Twenty20 cricket tournament will have a salary cap of
A$1 million ($1 million) for the inaugural season.  The minimum retainer has been set at A$20,000 and the first
window for contracting players will begin tomorrow and close
July 22, Cricket Australia said today. Teams can sign as many as
18 players during that time, including two from overseas.  “Contracting will be conducted under a free agency player
allocation model,” Cricket Australia said in a statement.
“Teams and players can negotiate with each other as they
choose, within the defined salary cap.”  The final squads of 18 players must be submitted by Dec. 9,
a week before the opening match, Cricket Australia said. The
expanded T20 Big Bash League competition for 2011-12 includes
two teams each in Sydney and  Melbourne , Australia’s most-
populous cities.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
