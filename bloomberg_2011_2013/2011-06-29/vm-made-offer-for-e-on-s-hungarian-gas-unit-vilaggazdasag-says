Hungary’s state-owned electricity
wholesaler MVM Zrt. offered 800 million euros ($1.2 billion) for
 E.ON AG (EOAN) ’s Hungarian gas unit two months ago,  Vilaggazdasag 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  MVM’s offer wasn’t successful “for now” as E.ON demanded
1.2 billion euros for the unit, which includes gas wholesale,
import contracts and underground storage, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
