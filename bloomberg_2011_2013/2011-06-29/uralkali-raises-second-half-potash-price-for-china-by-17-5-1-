OAO  Uralkali (URKA) , the world’s largest
potash producer by output, increased prices for  China  by 17.5
percent for the second half of the year.  Belarusian Potash Co., a joint venture trader of Uralkali
and Belaruskali, agreed to supply potash to Chinese importers at
$470 a metric ton, Uralkali said in a statement today. They paid
$400 a ton in the first half, Uralkali’s website shows.  BPC will supply 500,000 tons to China’s Sinochem and China
National Agricultural Means of Production Group Corp. in the
period, with an option for 200,000 tons more, Uralkali said.  Uralkali, based in Berezniki, Russia, is in talks on potash
supply contracts with India, Chief Executive Officer Vladislav Baumgertner told reporters yesterday in Moscow. Prices for  India 
will probably be higher than for China, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
