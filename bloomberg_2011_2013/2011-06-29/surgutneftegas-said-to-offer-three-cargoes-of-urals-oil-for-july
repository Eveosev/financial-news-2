OAO Surgutneftegas, a Russian oil
producer, issued a tender to sell a total of 340,000 metric tons
of Urals crude for loading in July, said two traders who
participate in the market.  The company is seeking to sell two 100,000-ton cargoes for
loading from Primorsk port on the  Baltic Sea  and one 140,000-ton
shipment from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea , said the
people, who declined to be identified because they arenâ€™t
authorized to speak on the matter. The tender will close
tomorrow.  Last week, the company sold a total of four cargoes of
Urals for loading in July to Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Repsol
YPF SA through two tenders.  Details of the sale are as follows:  To contact the reporter on this story:
