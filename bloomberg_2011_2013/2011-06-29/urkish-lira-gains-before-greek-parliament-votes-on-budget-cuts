The lira snapped a seven-day losing
streak and bonds gained as the Greek parliament passed budget
cuts aimed at preventing a default and the Turkish central bank
cut its dollar purchases in daily auctions.  The lira strengthened 0.6 percent to 1.6323 per dollar at
5:38 p.m. in Istanbul. The yield on benchmark two-year bonds
fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 9.14
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield fell
for the first day in three, the TEB Local Benchmark Bond Index
showed.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won approval of his
78 billion-euro ($112 billion) package of budget cuts and asset
sales, key to receiving further international financial aid. The
Turkish central bank said today it was reducing the amount of
dollars it buys in daily auctions to $30 million from $40
million.  Turkey ’s currency has depreciated 5.4 percent this year,
making it the worst performer among more than 20 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The central bank has kept
 interest rates  at a record low of 6.25 percent since January.  “Today’s move on the FX auctions, although small, is very
significant in our view, as it is the first time in many months
that the central bank has come out with clear action,” Simon Quijano-Evans, chief economist at ING Groep NV in  London , said
in e-mailed comments. “Markets will want to see more of the
same.”  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  rose 0.3 percent to 63,002.88,
advancing for a second day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
