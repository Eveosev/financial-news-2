Advisers to New York Governor  Andrew Cuomo  told officials at  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  that he’s determined to
shut the company’s Indian Point nuclear plant, the  New York
Times reported .  The licenses for two reactors, located about 35 miles north
of New York City, are set to expire in 2013 and 2015. A new law
to streamline the siting of new power plants may make it easier
to replace the electricity produced at Indian Point, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
