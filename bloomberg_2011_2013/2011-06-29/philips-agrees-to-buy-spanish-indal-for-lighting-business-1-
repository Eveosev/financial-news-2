Royal Philips Electronics NV, the
world’s biggest maker of light bulbs, agreed to buy Spanish
lighting company Grupo Indal for an undisclosed sum, a week
after predicting lower earnings for the lighting division.  Indal had 2010 revenue of 156 million euros ($224 million)
and employs about 1,000 people, Amsterdam-based Philips said in
a statement today. Indal provides outdoor lighting for road,
industrial and floodlighting applications, Philips said.  Indal’s capabilities strengthen Philips’s ability to offer
“integrated and high-value options for professional lighting,”
Marc de Jong, general manager for the Professional Luminaires
business of Philips Lighting, said in the statement.  Philips said on June 22 that it needs to deepen cost cuts
to combat deteriorating demand for lighting and consumer
electronics. Narrowing margins and lower sales growth will
result in earnings before interest, taxes and amortization at
the lighting unit of 85 million euros in the second quarter,
Philips predicted. That compares with 210 million euros in the
year-earlier period, and a 165 million-euro estimate of analysts
at SNS Securities.  Philips rose 0.7 percent to 16.91 euros at 9:18 a.m. in
Amsterdam trading.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
