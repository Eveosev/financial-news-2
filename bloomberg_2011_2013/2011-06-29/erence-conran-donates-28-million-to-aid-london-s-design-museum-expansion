Terence Conran, the designer and
restaurateur who founded the Habitat store chain, is donating
the equivalent of 17.5 million pounds ($28 million) to help the
 Design Museum  move into a new  London  home with three times the
space of the current premises, the trustees said today.  The gift consists of 7.5 million pounds in cash and the
value of the sale of the lease of the present building at Shad
Thames, valued at about 10 million pounds. This will take
Conran’s contribution to the museum and its predecessor to 50
million pounds over 30 years, the trustees said in a statement.  “Sir Terence’s exceptionally generous gift to the Design
Museum will not only help this excellent institution move to a
new home, but will also help showcase Britain’s ability to
produce some of the world’s greatest designers,” Culture
Secretary  Jeremy Hunt  said in an e-mailed release.  Conran established the forerunner of the museum, the
Boilerhouse, in the basement of the  Victoria and Albert Museum 
in 1982, before the Design Museum opened at Shad Thames in 1989.
The museum plans to move into the former Commonwealth Institute,
with the project scheduled for completion by 2014.  To contact the writer on the story:
