The Australian dollar rose to a two-
week high versus the greenback before a central bank report that
economists said will show bank lending expanded last month.  The so-called Aussie advanced for a third day as traders
trimmed bets that the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  will cut
 interest rates  in the next 12 months. New Zealand’s currency
climbed toward a record versus the greenback on optimism
European officials will support further aid for Greece, boosting
demand for riskier assets.  “The market is expecting an improvement in the lending
numbers and that could give the Aussie a little more upside
momentum,” said Jim Vrondas, a manager at the online foreign-
exchange dealer OzForex Ltd. in Sydney. “Domestically we’re
looking pretty good.”  Australia’s dollar appreciated to $1.0706 as of 10:08 a.m.
in Sydney from $1.0683 in  New York  yesterday after rising to
$1.0711, the highest since June 15. The currency traded at 86.38
yen from 86.29 yen and reached 86.41, the most since June 6.  New Zealand ’s dollar rose 0.4 percent to 82.82 U.S. cents,
after reaching 82.92 cents, the most since June 9, when it
touched a record. The kiwi advanced 0.2 percent to 66.83 yen.  Both currencies were supported after Greek Prime Minister
George Papandreou won support yesterday for a bill laying out a
strategy for budget cuts. Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who
leads a group of euro-area finance ministers, said the Greek
vote paves the way for payment of the next aid installment from
euro-area governments and the  International Monetary Fund .  Loans provided by Australian banks and finance companies
increased 0.4 percent in May from the previous month, the RBA
will say today, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists.  New Zealand’s currency rose against 15 of its 16 major
counterparts as a government report showed home-building
approvals rose in May for the second time in three months.
Permits increased 2.2 percent after falling a revised 1.2
percent in April,  Statistics New Zealand  said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
