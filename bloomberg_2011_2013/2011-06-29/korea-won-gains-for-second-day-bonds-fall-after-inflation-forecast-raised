South Korea ’s won rose for a second
day and bonds fell on speculation the central bank will boost
borrowing costs after the government said inflation this year
would be faster than predicted.  The yield on five-year notes climbed to the highest level
in more than a month after the presidential office said in a
statement yesterday that consumer-price inflation will be around
4 percent this year, compared with the official target of 3
percent. Germany’s biggest lenders and insurers will meet with
the  Finance Ministry  in Berlin today to thresh out their
contribution to a Greek aid package as parliament votes on a 78
billion-euro ($112 billion) austerity plan.  “Comments on inflation are adding to speculation that the
central bank may need to raise  interest rates  in the second
half,” said Kong Dong Rak, fixed-income analyst at Taurus
Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “Rising confidence that
 Greece  will avoid a default is reducing appetite for bonds as a
safe-haven asset.”  The won rose 0.6 percent to 1,076.80 per dollar as of the 3
p.m. close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency advanced as much as 0.7 percent earlier.  The yield on the 4 percent government bonds due March 2016
rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.01
percent, the highest since May 11, according to prices from
Korea Exchange Inc. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
