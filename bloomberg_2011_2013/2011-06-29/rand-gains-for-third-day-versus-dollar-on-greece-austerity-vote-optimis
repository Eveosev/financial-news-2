The rand strengthened versus the
dollar for a third day after Greek lawmakers voted to approve a
package of austerity measures to avert a debt default, boosting
investor appetite for high-yielding assets.  The South African currency gained as much as 0.4 percent to
6.8818 per dollar, and traded up 0.3 percent at 6.8230 at 6:02
p.m. in Johannesburg. It slipped 0.3 percent to 9.8466 per euro.  Emerging-market stocks rose to a two-week high and
commodities rallied for a second day. Advances in gold and
platinum, which account for 20 percent of  South Africa ’s
exports, helped drive South Africa’s benchmark stock index to
the highest since June 7.  “The rand continues to take its cue from the level of
global risk appetite,” Standard Bank Group Ltd. analysts led by
Johannesburg-based Michael Keenan wrote in a research note. The
currency may strengthen to 6.77 per dollar in coming weeks, they
wrote.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  got 155 out of 300
votes in Parliament, enough for passage of his 78 billion euro
($112 billion) plan for budget cuts and state asset sales. The
bill is a prerequisite for the cash-strapped nation to tap a
fifth portion of last year’s European Union rescue package. The
Greek parliament faces a second vote tomorrow to authorize
implementation for the measures.  The rand pared gains immediately after the vote as traders
who had bought the currency anticipating the austerity measures
would be approved unwound positions. The currency had gained 0.9
percent versus the dollar in two days before today’s vote.  “Today’s positive vote was largely discounted already,”
Ian Cruickshanks, head of treasury strategic research at
Johannesburg-based Nedbank Capital, a unit of South Africa’s
fourth-biggest bank, said by phone.  Bonds declined for second day. The 13.5 percent notes due
2015 slipped 25 cents to 121.16 rand, driving the yield up five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.51 percent. The .
bond due 2021 dropped 37 cents to 88.89 rand, boosting the yield
six basis points to 8.44 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
