The Sheskharis and Caspian Pipeline
Consortium oil terminals at  Russia â€™s Black Sea port of
Novorossiysk opened to tankers after closing due to bad weather
June 26, a port agent said today.  Mooring operations resumed at Sheskharis at 4 p.m. local
time yesterday, and the Caspian Pipeline Consortium facility
opened an hour later, GAC Russia Agency Operations Supervisor
Stanislav Szygar said.  Tankers moor at the terminals to collect cargoes of up to 1
million barrels of oil. Sheskharis is an outlet for Urals crude,
and CPC Blend is exported from the Caspian Pipeline Consortium
terminal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
