Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA (PGN) , Poland’s dominant gas company, said it wants to
spend as much as 27 billion zloty ($9.8 billion) on investment
through 2015.  PGNiG will invest about 14.7 billion zloty in the search
for natural gas and oil as well as output as it seeks to boost
domestic gas production to 4.5 billion cubic meters a year by
2015 from the current 4.1 billion and double oil output to 1
million tons, the company said in a regulatory statement.  Releasing its 2011 strategy, PGNiG maintained targets for
total gas production at as much as 6.2 billion cubic meters a
year and about 1.8 million tons for oil output. The company said
it will spend about 9 billion zloty on foreign exploration and
output and 5 billion zloty on domestic investments.  Domestic operations will include the research for fuel from
unconventional resources, including shale gas, it said.
Additionally, PGNiG wants to invest in the production of energy
from gas. Planned spending in this ‘new business area” will be
as much as 2.9 billion zloty by 2015, it said.  The company said it wants to spend about 500 million zloty
on wholesale and trading business between 2011 and 2015 as well
as around 1.4 billion zloty on storage infrastructure. It aims
to increase storage capacity by 1.4 billion cubic meters to 3
billion by 2015, less than the 3.8 billion meters of capacity
previously planned.  The company plans to invest as much as 5.8 billion zloty in
distribution operations by 2015, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
