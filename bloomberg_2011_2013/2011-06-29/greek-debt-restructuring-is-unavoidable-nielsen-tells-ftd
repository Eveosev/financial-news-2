A Greek debt restructuring is
“unavoidable,” Guillermo Nielsen, a former Argentinian finance
secretary who oversaw the country’s defaulted debt exchange in
2005, told  Financial Times Deutschland .  “Politicians in the euro zone consider a restructuring as
one of many options and seem to believe that they can ride out
the problem,” the German newspaper cited Nielsen as saying.
“But lawmakers only have the option between an orderly
restructuring and a disorderly sovereign default. A haircut on
debt is unavoidable.”  Greece  would need a haircut of at least 64 percent on its
bonds to stabilize its debt and another aid package of 150
billion euros ($216 billion), of which two thirds should be used
to support the banking sector and one third to stimulate the
economy, Nielsen told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
