AT&T Inc. (T) , the second-largest U.S.
wireless provider, said it will begin offering exclusive content
from Zynga Inc. later this year as it seeks to tap into the
market for downloadable smartphone games such as “FarmVille.”  The carrier will add multiple Zynga games to its wireless
store, including “Words with Friends” and "Zynga Poker,"
according to a statement. While the content is exclusive, the
agreement doesn’t preclude Zynga from making similar deals with
other carriers, said Mari Melguizo, an AT&T spokeswoman. Terms
of the agreement weren’t disclosed.  Separately, Dallas-based AT&T will introduce later this
year an  HTC Corp. (2498)  handset, known as the Status, that features a
button for quick access to Facebook Inc.’s website, said
Melguizo. She said users will be able to update their Facebook
pages more quickly and efficiently with the Status.  Melguizo declined to say when the Status would be available
or at what price.  Zynga, based in  San Francisco , is set to file paperwork for
an initial public offering today, said investor GreenCrest
Capital Management LLC. The offering may raise more than $1
billion, GreenCrest said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
