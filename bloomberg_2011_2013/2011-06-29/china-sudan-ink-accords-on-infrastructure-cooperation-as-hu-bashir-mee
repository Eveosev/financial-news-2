China  and Sudan signed agreements on
loans for infrastructure and equipment and economic and
technological cooperation during a meeting between President Hu
Jintao and his Sudanese counterpart Umar al-Bashir in Beijing.  Al-Bashir, indicted for genocide and war crimes by the
 International Criminal Court , arrived in China yesterday after
being forced to postpone meetings because his plane was turned
back by Turkmenistan authorities. China, which isn’t a signatory
to the ICC convention, has repeatedly said it has reservations
about the court’s charges and that it will continue to engage
with al-Bashir’s government.  The agreements, signed by officials of both countries in
the presence of the two heads of state, covered loans for a
bridge project in eastern  Sudan  and a facility for equipment and
materials, according to a pooled press report. No further
details were given.  China continues to court Sudan’s leaders, as well as the
new government of the country’s oil-rich south, which is to
split away next month to form an independent country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
