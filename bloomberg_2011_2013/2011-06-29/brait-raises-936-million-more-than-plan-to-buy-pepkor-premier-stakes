Brait SA (BAT) ,  South Africa ’s largest
private equity company, raised a larger-than-planned 6.4 billion
rand ($936 million) in a rights offer and private placement to
buy stakes in Pepkor Ltd. and Premier Foods Plc.  Strong demand for Brait’s shares meant the company raised
500 million rand more than it had been targeting, it said in a
statement today. Proceeds will be used to buy shares in Pepkor,
South Africa’s biggest clothing retailer, and Premier Foods,
maker of Blue Ribbon bread and Snowflake flour.  Brait, based in Johannesburg, is transforming itself into
an  investment company  to allow it to become a long-term investor
rather than having the short-term profile of a private equity
operator, it said on March 2.  Existing shareholders took up 81 percent of the offering,
with the remainder sold to its underwriters through an auction
arranged by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange today, Brait said.  The company’s investment team, led by Chief Executive
Officer John Gnodde, bought a further 30.3 million shares in
order to get an 18 percent stake in Brait, it said. Pepkor
Chairman Christo Wiese’sTitan Nominees (Pty) Ltd. also bought
shares in the offering, taking its stake to 33.3 percent, Brait
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
