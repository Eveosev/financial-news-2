U.S. stocks rose, giving benchmark
indexes the biggest three-day gain since March, as Greece passed
austerity measures and the  Federal Reserve  moved to set a less-
severe limit on debit-card swipe fees than previously proposed.  Visa Inc. (V)  and  MasterCard Inc. (MA) , the biggest consumer-payment
networks, jumped more than 11 percent, as the Fed moved to cap
debit-card transaction fees at 21 cents.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
advanced 3 percent after agreeing to pay $8.5 billion to resolve
claims over soured mortgages.  Monsanto Co. (MON) , the largest seed
company, climbed 5 percent after net income jumped 77 percent.
U.S. Steel Corp. paced a rally in steelmakers, rising 5.9
percent, as Deutsche Bank AG predicted demand rebound.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.8 percent to
1,307.41 at 4 p.m. in New York, adding 3.1 percent in three
days. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added 72.73 points, or
0.6 percent, to 12,261.42 today.  “ Greece  is kicking the can down the road,” said Bruce McCain, who helps oversee $22 billion as chief investment
strategist at the private-banking unit of KeyCorp in Cleveland.
“That’s certainly an important first step. On top of that, the
economy has a number of catalysts that could help push the
market higher over the next few weeks. We’ve came down a lot on
price. It seems a bit overdone.”  The S&P 500 has fallen 2.8 percent in June, and headed for
the second straight monthly loss, amid concern about the
European debt crisis and weaker-than-expected economic data. The
index is still up 4 percent in 2011 on government stimulus
measures and better-than-estimated profits.  Greece’s Package  Global stocks rose for a third day, the longest advance in
a month, as Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  clinched
enough votes to pass the first part of an austerity plan aimed
at meeting European Union aid requirements and staving off
default for his debt-laden nation. Papandreou is now on track to
secure a bill setting out the strategy for a 78 billion-euro
($112 billion) package of budget cuts and asset sales that is
the condition for further rescue funds.  “It relieves a certain amount of uncertainty related to
outsized risks that would come with a default,” said Kevin Caron, market strategist in  Florham Park ,  New Jersey , at Stifel
Nicolaus & Co., which has $115 billion in client assets. In
addition, “it was good to see that home sales rose more than
expected. That was a positive sign.”  Housing Data  More Americans than forecast signed contracts in May to buy
previously owned homes. The index of pending home resales
increased 8.2 percent from April after a revised 11 percent drop
the prior month that was smaller than initially reported, the
National Association of Realtors said. Economists forecast a 3
percent increase, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Financial shares had the biggest gain in the  S&P 500  within
10 industries, rising 2.1 percent. Visa soared 15 percent, the
most since March 2008, to $86.57. MasterCard surged 11 percent
to $309.70, the highest since June 2008.  “This is a big win for Visa and MasterCard,” said  Giri Cherukuri , lead trader and portfolio manager for Lisle,
Illinois-based Oakbrook Investments, which manages about $2.7
billion. “They’ve been arguing for a long time that these
regulations are too onerous. Definitely good news for them.”  Bank of America added 3 percent to $11.14. The stock rose
even after the bank said its settlement will contribute to a
second-quarter loss of $8.6 billion to $9.1 billion, or 88 cents
to 93 cents a share.  Citigroup Rallies  Citigroup Inc. (C)  advanced 3.4 percent to $41.50. Bank of
America raised the stock to “buy” from “neutral,” saying
potential earnings should lift the shares.  Gauges of raw material and energy shares in the S&P 500
gained at least 1.1 percent. The S&P GSCI Index of 24
commodities advanced 2.1 percent as oil and metals rallied.  Monsanto climbed 5 percent to $70.26. The world’s largest
seed company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that topped
analysts’ estimates and raised its full-year profit forecast on
higher sales of Roundup weed killer and genetically modified
crop seeds. Profit excluding some items will rise to $2.84 to
$2.88 a share in the fiscal year through August. Its previous
forecast was for $2.72 to $2.82.  U.S. Steel rallied 5.9 percent, the biggest increase since
July 2010, to $45.85. Deutsche Bank AG said demand and prices
for the metal will rise. Steel producers in the U.S. will
benefit as Chinese inventories empty and industrial activity
picks up in the second half of 2011, analysts including David Martin and  Jorge Beristain  wrote in a research note yesterday.  Higher Ratings  Deutsche Bank raised its ratings on Pittsburgh-based U.S.
Steel and  AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS) , the third-largest U.S.
steelmaker, to “buy” from “hold.”  BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc. (BJ)  climbed 4.6 percent to $50.29 as
Leonard Green & Partners LP and  CVC Capital Partners  agreed to
buy the warehouse-club chain for $2.8 billion. Its investors
will receive $51.25 a share in cash for each common stock they
hold, the companies said. That’s 6.6 percent more than the
closing price yesterday.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the S&P 500, tumbled 9.9 percent, the most since March, to
17.27.  A gauge of homebuilders in S&P indexes slumped 2.3 percent.
 KB Home (KBH)  tumbled 15 percent, the most since September 2008, to
$10.08. The Los Angeles-based homebuilder that targets first-
time buyers reported a wider second-quarter loss as new orders
and revenue decreased amid weak demand for new houses.
PulteGroup Inc. declined 3.9 percent to $7.58. D.R. Horton Inc.
fell 3.2 percent to $11.37.  To contact the reporters on this story:
