Howard Hughes Corp. (HHC) , the real estate
company spun off last year from  General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) ,
bought an interest in a master-planned community in Texas from a
unit of  Morgan Stanley (MS)  for $117.5 million.  Howard Hughes will take full control of the Woodlands
development in Houston, the Dallas-based company said in a
statement today. The 28,000-acre (11,300-hectare) community has
97,000 residents and 1,372 acres of residential land for sale.
It also has 936 acres of unsold land for commercial use.  Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing has owned a stake in
Woodlands since 1997, while Howard Hughes has been an investor
since 2004. The project generated $36 million in revenue in the
first quarter from the sale of residential and commercial real
estate lots, and is projected to sell out in 2022, according to
Howard Hughesâ€™s annual report.  The company owns master-planned residential communities and
commercial real estate, including Summerlin, a 22,500-acre
residential project in  Las Vegas , and South Street Seaport, a
shopping center in Manhattan.  Howard Hughes rose 94 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $63.23
yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
