Middle East oils for sale to  Asia 
slumped against their benchmarks with cargoes remaining
available as refiners wound down their purchases for the month.  Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.’s Upper Zakum for August loading
dropped 3 cents to a discount of 38 cents a barrel to its
official selling price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the biggest gap since August 2009. Qatar Marine dropped 1
cent to 48 cents below its official level, the largest discount
since June 17, Bloomberg data showed.  Extra cargoes remain in the market as refiners reach the
end of the monthly purchase period for August supplies. Demand
for shipments has eased on concern over an oil glut after  Saudi
Arabia  agreed to sell more crude and the  International Energy
Agency  said it would release stockpiles.  Oman futures for August delivery fell 80 cents to $103.90 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 4:38 p.m. Singapore
time, with 305 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$103.98 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  Oman crude for immediate loading surged $2, or 1.9 percent,
to $105.73 barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil for delivery
in August jumped 2 percent to $105.31. Murban increased 2
percent to $109.88.  The August Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker against the Persian Gulf grade, narrowed 6
cents to $4.44 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., an oil and refined-products broker in  London .
The exchange for swaps for September rose 20 cents to $4.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
