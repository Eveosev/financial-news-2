Above-average warmth will linger in
the U.S. Midwest and East through the middle of next week,
boosting energy demand for cooling, said  Matt Rogers , president
of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  While the heat won’t be as severe as initial forecasts, it
should last until the next wave of cooler air arrives around
July 7 or July 8, Rogers said today from his office in Bethesda,
Maryland.  A pocket of warmer-than-normal air is forecast to settle in
over the Rocky Mountains and central  California  in the July 4 to
July 8 period, Rogers said.  In his 11- to 15-day forecast, Rogers calls for the most
intense heat to develop over Texas, with much of the South and
Rocky Mountains states also being warmer than average. The rest
of the country should be seasonable.  Natural-gas traders monitor  weather forecasts  to determine
whether temperatures may boost heating or cooling demand.
Predictions of below-normal or above-normal temperatures may
prompt traders to buy or sell gas futures. Commodity traders
watch precipitation forecasts for impact on planting and yields.  Rogers said there won’t be any significant threats from
tropical systems through the next two weeks. Tropical Storm
Arlene, which formed in the Bay of Campeche, will come ashore in
 Mexico  overnight, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
