OAO  Russian Sea Group (RSEA)  climbed to its
highest since March after the fish producer and distributor said
billionaire Gennady Timchenko’s Volga Resources will acquire a
stake in the company via a joint venture.  The shares climbed as much as 24 percent before closing up
8.6 percent at 75.32 rubles by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow,
its strongest since March 14.  Volga Resources has agreed to form a 50-50 venture with
Maxim Vorobiev’s RS Group that will hold 60.936 percent of
Russian Sea Group, according to a regulatory filing yesterday.  “A new anchor investor in RSG might be positive for the
company,” Maria Kolbina, an equity analyst at VTB Capital, said
in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
