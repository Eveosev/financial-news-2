The Treasury Department’s $29
billion sale of seven-year notes may draw a yield of 2.420
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of eight of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in June 2018, yielded 2.410
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time.  The size of the offering is the same as at the past 11
sales of the seven-year maturity after peaking at $32 billion in
auctions from November 2009 through April 2010.  Last month’s seven-year note sale drew a yield of 2.429
percent. The record low yield of 1.890 percent was reached at
the September 2010 auction.  The May 26 offering’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.24, versus an average of 2.89 for the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 47.6 percent of the notes at the
May auction, compared with an average of 50.1 percent for the
past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 13 percent of
the notes at the last offering, compared with the 10-auction
average of 8.1 percent.  Seven-year notes have returned 4.7 percent this year, after
gaining 8.3 percent in 2010, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes. The overall Treasury market has returned
2.7 percent in 2011 after rising 5.9 percent last year.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  At yesterday’s $35 billion five-year note auction,
investors bid for 2.59 times the amount offered, the lowest
since June 2010. A record low yield of 0.395 percent at the $35
billion offering of two-year notes on June 27 drew the lowest
demand from indirect bidders in more than three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
