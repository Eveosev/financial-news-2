Salvatore Ferragamo SpA rose as much
as 9.2 percent in the Italian luxury shoemaker’s debut on the
Milan exchange after raising 344.5 million euros ($496 million)
in an initial public offering.  The stock gained as much as 83 cents to 9.83 euros and was
up 8.9 percent, at 9.80 euros, as of 11:39 a.m., giving the
Florence, Italy-based company a market value of 1.65 billion
euros. Ferragamo sold shares at 9 euros each, near the midpoint
of the marketed range of 8 euros to 10.50 euros.  Ferragamo joins luxury-goods makers including Prada SpA in
selling stock to the public as demand for bags and shoes in Asia
fuels sales growth and draws investors. Prada, the Milan-based
maker of Church’s shoes, has risen 15 percent since it started
trading June 24 in  Hong Kong ’s biggest IPO this year.  “Ferragamo, like Prada, is part of a unique Italian
industry that is growing in emerging markets and the U.S., and
that explains their success in the IPO,” said Fabrizio Spagna,
chairman of Axia Financial Research in Padua,  Italy . “The stock
is attractive because it’s a visible and recognized brand that
managed to stay profitable, even through the crisis.”  Ferragamo, whose shoes have been worn by  Marilyn Monroe  and
 Jennifer Lopez , reported net income of 60.8 million euros in
2010 compared with a loss of 14.7 million euros a year earlier.
Sales rose 26 percent to 781.6 million euros. Earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization advanced 83
percent in the period to 113.1 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
