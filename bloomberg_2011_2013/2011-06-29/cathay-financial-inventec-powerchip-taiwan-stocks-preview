business.  HTC Corp. (2498)  (2498 TT), the world’s largest maker of mobile
phones that use Google Inc.’s Android operating system, dropped

speculation the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based company’s second-quarter

from the brokerage. Maggie Cheng, a spokeswoman for HTC, didn’t
immediately respond to calls to her office and mobile phones.  MStar Semiconductor Inc. (3697 TT) advanced 4.4 percent to

The two contract makers may get orders from Samsung Electronics
Co. to produce its notebooks, the Economic Daily News reported,
without saying where it got the information from. Samsung was
producing at maximum capacity after raising output targets, the
newspaper said, without citing anyone. Pegatron Chief Financial
Officer Charles Lin and Inventec CFO Alex Hsu weren’t in their
offices for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
