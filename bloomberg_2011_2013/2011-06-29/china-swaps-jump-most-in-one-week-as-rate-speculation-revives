China ’s interest-rate swaps jumped
by the most in one week on speculation policy makers will boost
 interest rates  after the central bank lifted the yield on one-
year bills for a second sale.  The People’s Bank of China sold 2 billion yuan ($309
million) of the securities at 3.4982 percent yesterday, compared
with 3.4019 percent at a sale on June 21. Inflation is likely to
average 5.3 percent this year, topping the government’s 4
percent target, the Economic Information Daily reported today,
citing Li Jianwei, director of the macro economy research
institute under the State Council’s Development Research Center.  “You have a lot of funding stresses” said  Matthew Huang ,
Asian currency and rates strategist at Macquarie Group Ltd. in
 Singapore . “Most of the banks are still expecting another rate
hike.”  The one-year interest rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, increased six
basis points to 3.82 percent as of 5:12 p.m. in Shanghai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 4.03 percent
on June 23, the highest level since at least 2006.  China has paused for 11 weeks in raising interest rates,
the longest gap since increases began in October. Consumer
prices climbed 5.5 percent in May from a year earlier, the most
since July 2008, the statistics bureau said on June 14.  Consumer-price increases may stabilize in the third quarter
before accelerating in the fourth, driven by rising wages and
imported inflation, the newspaper cited Li as saying. Inflation
may reach 7.1 percent in the third quarter of next year, partly
due to higher commodity prices, he said.  The seven-day repo rate, a gauge of cash in the financial
system, fell 25 basis points to 6.38 percent in  Shanghai ,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The yield on the 3.83 percent government bond due March
2021 was unchanged at 3.83 percent, according to the Interbank
Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Ven Ram, Sandy Hendry  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
