European stocks rose for a third day
amid speculation that Greek lawmakers will pass an austerity
plan needed to avoid default.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.6 percent to 266.86 at
8:02 a.m. in  London  for the longest winning streak in almost two
months. The benchmark gauge has still tumbled 8.4 percent from
its peak this year on Feb. 17 as investors speculated that
 Greece  will fail to repay all its debt. The retreat left the
measure trading at the cheapest valuation compared with reported
profits since 2008 last week, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
