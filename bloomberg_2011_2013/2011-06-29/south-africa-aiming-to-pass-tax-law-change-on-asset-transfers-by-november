South Africa ’s National Treasury
said it expects Parliament to pass new tax laws by Nov. 30 that
will regulate asset transfers within companies.  While the government remains committed to allowing the
“tax neutral” movement of assets within companies, it won’t
allow “artificial” structures set up for the purpose of  tax
avoidance , the Treasury said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
