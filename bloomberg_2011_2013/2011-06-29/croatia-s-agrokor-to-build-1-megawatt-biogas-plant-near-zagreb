Agrokor d.d.,  Croatia ’s largest
privately held company, will build a 1-megawatt biogas plant
northeast of the capital Zagreb.  The Vrbovec facility will be built by Slovenia’s  GH
Holding , the company said late yesterday in an e-mailed
statement.  Croatia’s biggest food producer by revenue plans to invest
1 billion kuna ($194 million) in the next five years to build 30
megawatts of biogas projects, it said.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
