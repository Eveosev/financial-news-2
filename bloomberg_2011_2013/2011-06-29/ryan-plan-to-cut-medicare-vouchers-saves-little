Giving wealthy seniors less for
Medicare, a component of a budget plan by Representative  Paul Ryan  that made the Wisconsin Republican a polarizing figure in
the U.S., would barely dent health spending, a Bloomberg
Government study shows.  The plan would replace the current Medicare system of
guaranteed benefits with payments to make up for the cost of
obtaining private health insurance. It offers less assistance to
seniors with the highest incomes, a policy known as “means
testing” that Ryan has said will reduce the  budget deficit .  Ryan would make the wealthiest 8 percent of 65-year-olds
pay a larger share of their health-care bills in 2022, the first
year the plan would take effect. Smaller U.S. subsidies would be
4.4 percent, or $1.2 billion, cheaper than if all beneficiaries
got the same assistance, according to the study.  The plan “actually generates very modest dollars” in
savings while giving higher-income seniors an incentive to pull
out of the entitlement program, said Judith Feder, a professor
at the  Georgetown Public Policy Institute  at  Georgetown
University  in  Washington . Costs for remaining beneficiaries may
be higher if that happens, she said.  Stephen Spruiell, a spokesman for Ryan, didn’t respond to
an e-mail requesting comment. Ryan is chairman of the House
Budget Committee.  A copy of the complete study may be found at  Bloomberg
