Minerva Plc (MNR) , the second-largest
developer in the  City of London  financial district, accepted a
takeover bid by a group of funds that values the company at
202.6 million pounds ($324 million).  Funds advised by Area Property Partners (U.K.) Ltd. and a
unit of DV4 Ltd. offered 120.5 pence a share, according to a
statement today. That’s 54 percent more than the closing price
of 78.5 pence on Jan. 13, the day before Minerva said it was in
talks that might lead to a bid.  “We have conducted an extensive auction process over the
past few months and the board has concluded that the offer is
the most attractive proposal and provides certain value for
Minerva shareholders,” Minerva Chairman Oliver Whitehead said
in the statement.  Minerva has been the subject of takeover talk for almost
three years. KiFin, the investment vehicle of Nathan Kirsh,
abandoned a 50 pence-a-share bid for Minerva in January 2010
after failing to win support from the developer’s shareholders.
That followed an unsuccessful attempt by Dubai’s Limitless LLC
to purchase Minerva in 2008. Two of Minerva’s developments, the
Walbrook and St. Botolphs, are in the City of  London .  Minerva rose 2.8 percent to 120.75 pence in London trading,
the highest since April 12, 2010. The shares have gained 52
percent this year.  Area Property Partners manages more than $11 billion of
equity and has overseen investment in more than 500 deals with a
total value of more than $50 billion, according to the
statement.  Greenhill & Co. is advising Minerva, while Delancy Real
Estate Asset Management Ltd. is acting for DV4.  The offer for Minerva was made through a new company called
Jupiter Properties 2011 U.K. Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
