Mumias Sugar Co.,  Kenya ’s biggest
maker of the sweetener, rose for the first time in six trading
sessions on speculation a 4.7 percent drop was overdone.  The stock gained 1.4 percent to 7.15 shillings as of the 3
p.m. close in Nairobi, the capital, the first increase since
June 21. The shares’ 14-day relative strength index closed
trading yesterday at 23.5 yesterday. A reading below 30
indicates to some technical analysts that a stock is due to
rise.  “What you are now seeing is purely bargain-buying,”
George Bodo, an equity strategist at Nairobi-based Apex Africa
Ltd., a brokerage, said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
