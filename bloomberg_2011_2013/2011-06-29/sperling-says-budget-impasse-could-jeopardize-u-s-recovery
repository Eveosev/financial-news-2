The stalemate in deficit
negotiations could jeopardize the U.S. economic recovery as the
Aug. 2 deadline to raise the debt ceiling approaches, said  Gene Sperling , director of the White House National Economic Council.  “We’re at a point of our recovery where we need more
momentum,” Sperling said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television. “This is about job growth, it’s about investment,
it’s about confidence. Why would anyone play games with that?”  Democrats and Republicans are striving for a deal to cut
spending and reduce the deficit over 10 years to clear the way
for an agreement to raise the nation’s borrowing limit,
currently capped at $14.3 trillion. The Treasury Department says
its ability to borrow runs out on Aug. 2.  “Why would any elected, serious public official who is
concerned about our job growth and our confidence play a game of
chicken on the default of the United States government?”
Sperling asked during today’s interview.  President  Barack Obama  earlier urged Republicans to put
raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans on the table. Obama
said at a news conference that Democrats are willing to accept
“painful cuts” to some government programs to fix the  budget
deficit .  Both sides have to be willing “to put some of their sacred
cows on the table,” Sperling said, while “you can’t have a
deficit-reduction plan that is going to ask seniors and the
middle class to do all the sacrifice.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
