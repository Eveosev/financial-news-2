The ruble climbed to the strongest
level in a week on bets  Greece ’s debt crisis will abate,
spurring demand for riskier assets.  Russia ’s currency appreciated for a second day, gaining 0.6
percent to 27.975 per dollar by the 5 p.m. close, which came
before the Greek vote ended and was the strongest since June 21.
The ruble was little changed against the euro at 40.3519,
leaving it 0.3 percent stronger versus the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket at 33.5446.  The Greek parliament passed Prime Minister  George
Papandreou ’s 78 billion-euro ($112 billion) austerity plan,
needed before the cash-strapped nation can tap a fifth
installment from last year’s 110 billion-euro rescue and euro-
area finance ministers can approve a second aid package.  “Market sentiment has lifted,” Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency
strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said in response to
e-mailed questions today. “Progress on a new aid package is
being made, which was taken positively by markets.”  Commerzbank predicts “some short- to medium-term
strengthening” of the ruble due to rising oil prices, “which
will, however, ease considerably by the end of the year,”
Nguyen said. The ruble will trade at 33.5 against the basket by
the end of 2011, Nguyen said.  Oil, Russia’s chief export earner, rose as much as 0.4
percent today, trading at $93.22 a barrel.  Russian  government bonds  advanced for a second day,
lowering the yield on dollar debt due in 2015 by ten basis
points to 2.893 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield on the country’s ruble Eurobond was little
changed at 6.987 percent.  Non-deliverable forwards, which allow companies to hedge
against currency movements, show the ruble at 28.2593 per dollar
in three months, compared with 28.3667 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
