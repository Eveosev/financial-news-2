Drillisch AG (DRI)  Chief Executive Officer
Paschalis Choulidis doesn’t rule out buying more shares of
 Freenet AG (FNTN) , as losses carried forward by that company to reduce
future tax liability wouldn’t be affected as long as Drillisch
owns less than 30 percent,  Boersen-Zeitung  reported, citing an
interview.  Freenet’s management has to retain “a certain capacity to
act” on its dividend and the proposed payment of 80 cents is
“not a bad sum,” Choulidis was cited as saying. While he
reiterated that a merger of the two companies would be “value-
creating,” there are “no talks” about a combination at
present, according to Boersen-Zeitung.  To contact the reporter on this story:
