HTC Corp. (2498)  shares dropped 3.9 percent
to NT$1,000 as of 11:53 a.m. in Taipei, set for the biggest
retreat since June 16.  There is market speculation the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based
company’s second-quarter handset shipments may be at 11 million,
compared with Deutsche Bank AG’s estimate for 11.8 million,
according to a sales note from the brokerage.  HTC may ship 12 million handsets in the second quarter, the
Economic Daily reported on May 23. The company itself forecast
shipments for the three-month period to be about 11 million to
11.5 million units, according to an April 29 statement.  Maggie Cheng, a spokeswoman for HTC, didn’t immediately
respond to calls to her office and mobile phones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
