Brighton Pier , a landmark in the
English resort thatâ€™s attracted visitors including Greta Garbo
and  Winston Churchill  since opening in 1899, was put on the
market for an undisclosed price by the leisure and amusement-
arcade operator that owns it.  Noble Group bought the pier in 1984 and the closely held
company has spent 35 million pounds ($56 million) to improve the
property, according to a statement today. The 1,760-foot (533-
meter) structure, originally called the Palace Pier, has 18
fairground attractions, two amusement arcades, shops, bars and
restaurants.  The pier is the last of three that were built in Brighton,
a resort made fashionable by the Prince Regent, later King
George IV, in the early 19th century. The Chain Pier was
destroyed in a storm and the  West Pier  closed to the public in
1975 on safety grounds and was destroyed by a fire in 2003.  GVA Humberts Leisure , a real estate broker, is handling the
sale of the pier, which has a Grade II listing because of its
historical importance. Brighton is a city about 44 miles (71
kilometers) south of  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
