Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , Colgate-
Palmolive (India) Ltd. and  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , the country’s biggest
 consumer goods  makers, climbed to their highest in at least 20
years in Mumbai trading after Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee
maintained his economic growth target.  Hindustan Unilever, the Indian unit of the world’s second-
biggest consumer-goods company, rose 2.8 percent to 332.80
rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, the highest level since
Bloomberg began compiling data in 1991. Colgate surged 7.8
percent to 986 rupees, making it the best performer on the
Bombay Stock Exchange Fast Moving Consumer Goods Index of 10
stocks. ITC gained 2.9 percent to 199.55 rupees.  “People would be taking comfort in buying out consumer
goods rather than other stocks” to counter rising inflation and
interest rates, said Himani Singh, an analyst with Elara
Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “There is a possibility of continued
future growth, which is what drives these stocks.”  Mukherjee is “still holding” the projection he made in
the budget that  India  will achieve growth of about 8.5 percent
in the year through March 31, 2012, even after the longest
string of monetary tightening measures in a decade, the minister
said in an interview in  Washington  yesterday. India’s $1.4
trillion economy expanded 7.8 percent in the three months
through March, the slowest pace in five quarters.  India’s wholesale-price inflation accelerated 9.06 percent
in May, from 8.66 percent in April, according to government data
published on June 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
