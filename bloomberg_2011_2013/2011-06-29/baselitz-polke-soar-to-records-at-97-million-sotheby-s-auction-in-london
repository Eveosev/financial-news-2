Dealers hailed a recovery in the
market for contemporary art last night after the biggest auction
held in  London .  The 88-lot  Sotheby’s (BID)  sale raised 108.8 million pounds ($175
million), helped by 60.4 million pounds for 34 works from the
Duerckheim Collection of German art.  Growing confidence among collectors in an increasingly
international market has boosted demand, defying concerns in the
wider economy. This has encouraged owners, such as Christian Graf Duerckheim-Ketelhodt, to release high-value works for sale.  “Some artists’ prices are now higher than they were in
2007,” the New York dealer  Stellan Holm  said. “The buying is a
lot more intelligent than it was in the boom. People aren’t just
buying brands and not everything is flying out of the window.
It’s a lot better than 2009, though.”  Five records were set for artists, including  Georg Baselitz 
and Sigmar Polke, among the works sold by the chairman of the
Cologne-based pharmaceutical company  Axiogenesis AG. (AI8)   “In terms of quality and range, Duerckheim’s was the best
collection of 1960s German works to have come on the market,”
said San Francisco dealer Anthony Meier, who bought a 2.1
million-pound Gerhard Richter painting for a client. “Estimates
were reasonable, prices were buoyant.”  Polke’s 1967 oil of a sunset, “Dschungel” (Jungle) -- the
largest of the artist’s “Rasterbilder” (dot paintings) to appear
at auction -- was the star of the collection. Measuring 8 feet
(2.4 meters) wide, it sold to a telephone bidder for 5.8 million
pounds, beating an upper estimate of 4 million pounds.  Top Baselitz  The top Baselitz was a 1965 painting of a male figure,
“Spekulatius,” bought by  New York ’s  Acquavella Galleries  for 3.2
million pounds.  Richter’s 1974 color chart “1024 Farben” sold to the New
York-based dealer Christophe van de Weghe, bidding for a client,
for 4.3 million pounds, more than double the upper estimate.  All but one of the Duerckheim lots found buyers, generating
a total that was almost double the low estimate of 31.8 million
pounds.  In the mixed-owner sale,  Eurythmics  musician Dave Stewart
sold a 1994 Damien Hirst spot painting “Dantrolene (Being God
for Dave).” The artist had given Stewart the canvas, with a
dedication on the back. The work made 1.1 million pounds,
against an estimate of as much as 800,000 pounds.  An Andy Warhol 1980 silk screen portrait of Blondie singer
Debbie Harry made a low-estimate 3.7 million pounds.  Francis Bacon ’s 1961 “Crouching Nude” sold for 8.3 million
pounds to a telephone bidder. It was valued at 7 million pounds
to 9 million pounds.  The sale was estimated to raise 74 million pounds to 105.4
million pounds at hammer prices. During the financial crisis,
when the values of some artists halved, Sotheby’s took just 17.9
million pounds at its equivalent offering in February 2009.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
