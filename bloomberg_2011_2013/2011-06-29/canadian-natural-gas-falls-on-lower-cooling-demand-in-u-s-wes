Canadian natural gas fell for the
first time in four days on forecasts of lower cooling demand in
the U.S. West that would cut the need for the fuel to power air-
conditioners.  Alberta  gas for July delivery fell 6.25 cents, or 1.7
percent, to C$3.605 per gigajoule ($3.52 per million British
thermal units) as of 12:40 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX, 
a Canadian Internet market. August gas fell 7.5 cents to C$3.38.
Gas traded on the exchange goes to users in Canada and the U.S.
and is priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  dropped 1.6 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $4.338 per
million Btu as of 12:24 p.m.  “This is a temporary correction here and I expect it to be
going up over the next couple of months because of stronger
demand and warmer weather going into a  hurricane season ,” Peter Linder, investment manager at DeltaOne Capital Partners in
Calgary, said in a telephone interview.  Cooling demand in  San Francisco  will be non-existent and 3
percent of normal in Seattle until at least July 6, according to
Belton, Missouri-based forecaster Weather Derivatives. Power
plants use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies, according to the
Energy Department.  Much of the West will have normal temperatures until July
3, and the Midwest will cool to normal from above-normal during
the July 4-8 period, MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg,
Maryland, said in a forecast to clients.  California Temperatures  The high in  Los Angeles  today may reach 76 degrees
Fahrenheit (24 Celsius), 6 below normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. of State College, Pennsylvania.  Volume on  TransCanada’s  Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.57 billion
cubic feet as of 11:30 a.m. in  New York .  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.91 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.7 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.06 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.85 billion cubic feet today, about 64
percent of its capacity of 2.9 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
gained 9.55 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $4.4529 per million Btu
yesterday on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an
express line that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the
