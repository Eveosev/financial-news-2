Spot gasoline in the West weakened
against futures for the second straight day after the Energy
Department reported an unexpected fall in U.S. stockpiles.  The discount for prompt-delivery, California-blend
gasoline, or Carbob, in  Los Angeles  widened 4.5 cents to 6.15
cents a gallon versus futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange as of 4:24 p.m. New York time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Yesterday, the fuel weakened 1.15 cents.  Gasoline for July delivery rose to a two-week high on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  after an Energy Department report
showed stockpiles of the motor fuel fell 1.43 million barrels to
213.2 million last week.  The discount for Carbob in  San Francisco  widened 4.25 cents
to 9.4 cents a gallon versus Nymex futures. Conventional, 87-
octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon, weakened to a discount of
1.5 cents after reaching parity with futures yesterday.  “The screen squeezed them pretty good today,” said Chris
Mennis, who owns oil broker New Wave Energy LLC in Aptos,
 California , referring to the gain in Nymex futures.  The premium for California-blend, low-sulfur diesel in Los
Angeles gained 1.25 cents to 10 cents versus heating oil
futures. The premium for the same fuel in San Francisco rose 0.5
cent to 10 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
