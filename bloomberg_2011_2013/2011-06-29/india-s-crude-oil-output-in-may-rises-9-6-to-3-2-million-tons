India ’s crude oil output rose for
the 18th straight month in May as  Oil India Ltd. (OINL)  and non-state
companies including  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR)  boosted production.  Asia ’s second-biggest energy consumer pumped 3.2 million
metric tons of oil last month, a 9.6 percent increase from a
year earlier, the  oil ministry  said in a statement today.  Production by non-state explorers climbed 33 percent to
916,500 tons. Output from Rajasthan state, where Cairn India
operates the country’s biggest onshore oil deposit, more than
doubled to 540,900 tons, according to the data. Cairn India
started output at the field in August 2009.  Oil India, the second-biggest state-run crude producer,
reported a 41 percent increase in output to 323,800 tons,
according to the statement.  Output by state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the nation’s
largest energy explorer, fell 1.7 percent to 2 million tons,
according to the ministry.  ONGC’s Mumbai High fields produced 1.4 million tons, a
decline of 3.3 percent. The fields, 100 miles (160 kilometers)
northwest of Mumbai in the  Arabian Sea , account for about 44
percent of India’s oil production.  Natural gas output in India fell for the sixth straight
month, declining 9.6 percent to 4.1 billion cubic meters,
according to the data.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s biggest company by market
value, cut production from the country’s largest gas field,
located off the east coast, to 50 million cubic meters a day
from a maximum level of 60 million because of reduced pressure
in the reservoir, according to the country’s oil regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
