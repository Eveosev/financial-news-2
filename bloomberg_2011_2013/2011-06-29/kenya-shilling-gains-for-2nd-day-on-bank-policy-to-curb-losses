Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for
the second day against the dollar after the central bank
announced policy measures aimed at reining in inflationary
expectations and curbing speculative trade in the currency.  The shilling appreciated as much as 0.6 percent to 89.63
per dollar and was 0.4 percent stronger at 89.80 by 2:35 p.m. in
the capital, Nairobi from yesterday’s close of 90.15.  The central bank of East Africa’s biggest economy will
start charging commercial lenders 8 percent on loans from its
so-called overnight discount window and review the rate on a
daily basis at 9 a.m., it said in an e-mailed statement today.
The bank also blocked use of funds borrowed from the overnight
window to trade in the  interbank market  or in the foreign-
exchange market, it said.  “This decision is expected to address the recent wild
swings in the local currency, which was largely due to arbitrage
and speculative trading,” Fred Moturi, a fixed-income dealer at
Nairobi-based Sterling Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  Kenya’s inflation rate climbed for the eighth straight
month to 14.5 percent in June, the highest in more than two
years, as food and fuel prices increased, the Kenya National
Bureau of Statistics said earlier today. The shilling has
declined 10 percent against the dollar this year, making it
Africa’s second-worst performing currency, after neighboring
 Uganda ’s, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
