OTP Bank Nyrt.’s Romanian arm is
interested in buying “anything” on the local market as it eyes
the acquisition of a large bank to gain market share, the unit’s
Chief Executive Officer Laszlo Diosi said.  The bank has “enough money for a significant acquisition”
and would be willing to buy the Romanian unit of a Greek bank,
if one was available, Diosi told a Bucharest conference today.  OTP, the largest lender in neighboring  Hungary , is in talks
with several banks about potential acquisitions in Romania,
Slovakia,  Croatia  and  Serbia  and has a “concrete target” in
Romania, Chairman Sandor Csanyi said in April. The Bucharest-
based  Ziarul Financiar  reported today that BNP Paribas SA of
 France , OTP and two British investment funds may bid for Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s Romanian unit.  “We are not interested in buying small banks in Romania,
that’s not our strategy,” Diosi said. “We want to buy a bank
that has at least the same size as us, or bigger, at a moment
when the organic growth has become very expensive and is not
profitable.”  Diosi declined to comment on whether OTP is reviewing the
books of RBS’s local arm.  OTP  Romania  would become the 10th or 11th largest bank in
the country following the acquisition, Deputy Chief Executive
Officer Laszlo Wolf said in April.  In Romania, OTP had a market share of 1.16 percent at the
end of 2010 and total assets of 3.9 billion lei ($1.3 billion).  OTP shares rose 2 percent to 5,903 forint at 3:40 p.m. in
Budapest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
