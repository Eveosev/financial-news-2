Georgia ’s inflation rate will fall
to 7.5 percent by the end of the year, after consumer-price
growth accelerated to 13.9 percent in the first quarter, the
central bank said.  While inflation may remain at 13 percent to 14 percent in
the second quarter, it will slow in the second half as food
prices stabilize, the  Tbilisi-based bank  said today in an e-
mailed report.  Inflation has exceeded the central bank’s 6 percent target
for the last 11 months, driven largely by food prices, which
comprise more than 40 percent of Georgia’s consumer-inflation
basket.  Consumer prices rose 14.3 percent in May from a year
earlier, up from 13.5 percent in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
