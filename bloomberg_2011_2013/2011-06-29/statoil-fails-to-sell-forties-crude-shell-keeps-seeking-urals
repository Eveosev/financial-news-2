Statoil ASA failed to sell  North Sea 
Forties crude even after it lowered its offering price. Royal
Dutch Shell Plc was unable to buy Russian Urals in northwest
Europe for the second day.  North Sea  Statoil failed to sell Forties at 55 cents a barrel below
Dated Brent for loading July 11 to July 13, according to a
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts trading
window. The company yesterday offered a cargo at a discount of
30 cents.  Shell maintained its offer to buy Forties for July 10 to
July 12 at 30 cents less than Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Trafigura Beheer BV didn’t manage to buy a shipment for
July 11 to July 13 at 85 cents below the cash cost of North Sea
crudes for August, and also failed to sell a cargo for July 13
to July 15 at 30 cents below Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before
the window, Forties loading in 10 to 21 days was 45 cents below
Dated Brent, compared with a discount of 39 cents yesterday,
according to Bloomberg data.  Brent for August settlement traded at $111.89 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the
window, up from $107.86 yesterday. The September contract was at
$110.80 a barrel, 9 cents less than August.  Mediterranean/Urals  Shell raised its bid for 100,000 metric tons of Urals for
July 8 to July 12 delivery to Rotterdam by 30 cents to a
discount of $1.90 a barrel to Dated Brent without attracting any
sellers. No bids or offers were made in the Mediterranean.  Iraq  will export 16.3 million barrels of Kirkuk crude oil
in July from the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean,
according to a shipping schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  The July program comprises 24 cargoes with total volume of
524,355 barrels a day, the plan showed. The cargo sizes range
from 250,000 barrels to 1 million barrels.  OAO Surgutneftegas, a Russian oil producer, issued a tender
to sell a total of 340,000 metric tons of Urals crude for
loading in July, said two traders who participate in the market.  The company is seeking to sell two 100,000-ton cargoes for
loading from Primorsk port on the  Baltic Sea  and one 140,000-ton
shipment from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea , they said. The
tender will close tomorrow.  West Africa  Bharat Petroleum Corp.,  India ’s second-biggest state
refiner, may not buy crude oil from the  spot market  for August
because it has excess supplies, two people with knowledge of the
matter said.  The company’s newly constructed Bina refinery in central
India is operating at about 35 percent capacity, the people
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
