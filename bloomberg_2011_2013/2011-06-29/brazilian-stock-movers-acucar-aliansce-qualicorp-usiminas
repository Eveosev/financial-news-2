The following companies had unusual
price changes in Sao Paulo trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4:15 p.m. New York time.
Preferred shares are usually the most-traded class of stock.  The Bovespa Index rose less than 0.1 percent to 62,333.97.  Aliansce Shopping Centers SA (ALSC3)  (ALSC3 BS) dropped 0.3 percent
to 13.94 reais after rising as much as 1.6 percent. The
Brazilian mall operator said it agreed to buy a 50 percent stake
in a project of a shopping center in Vila Velha, in the
Brazilian state of Espirito Santo. The company will pay 70
million reais ($44 million) for the stake and make additional
investments in the project, Aliansce said yesterday in a
regulatory filing. The total investment estimated for the
project is 292 million reais, the company said.  BR Properties SA (BRPR3)  (BRPR3 BS) rose 3.2 percent to 17.70
reais. The company is selling as many as 40.3 million common
shares, including a possible supplementary offering of 5.3
million shares, at yesterday’s closing price of 17.15 reais,
according to a regulatory filing.  Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar (PCAR4
BS) retreated 3.1 percent to 71 reais after jumping as much as
12 percent. Pao de Acucar fell as speculation eased that a
proposal by Banco BTG Pactual SA investment fund Gama to merge
the retailer with  Carrefour SA (CA) ’s Brazilian assets will succeed.  Qualicorp SA (QUAL3 BS) gained 16 percent to 15.05 reais.
The health-insurance broker started trading in Sao Paulo today
after pricing shares below the projected range in its June 27
initial public offering.  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA (USIM5 BS),  Brazil ’s
second-largest steelmaker, climbed 4.8 percent, the most in
almost five months, to 13.81 reais. Usiminas expects steel
production this year to fall or match about 7 million metric
tons in 2010, International Logistics Manager Rafael Borges said
in an interview in  Rio de Janeiro  today. The steelmaker is
reducing exports because of declining international prices, he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
