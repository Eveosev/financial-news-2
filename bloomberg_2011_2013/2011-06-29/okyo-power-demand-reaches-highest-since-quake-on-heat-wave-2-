Electricity demand in  Tokyo  and
surrounding areas was the most today since the March 11
disaster reduced capacity by crippling the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear plant, as temperatures hit a high for this year.  Power demand rose to 45,700 megawatts at 2 p.m.,
equivalent to 93 percent of Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s supply,
spokesman Taichi Okazaki said by telephone. Temperatures in
Tokyo’s Otemachi district reached a high for this year of 35.1
degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) as of 1:10 p.m.,
according to the weather agency.  Tepco and the government would warn the public of possible
blackouts if the area’s demand breached 97 percent of the
utility’s capacity, according to the company. Tepco is
expanding its supply by installing additional gas turbines and
buying excess power from factories that operate in-house
generators in a bid to prevent shortages in July and August --
the months when consumption typically reaches an annual peak
because of air conditioning usage.  Companies in Tokyo that use more than 500 kilowatts of
power capacity have been asked by the government to reduce
usage by 15 percent this summer from levels a year earlier.
Many businesses have turned off lights in common areas, turned
up thermostats and encouraged employees to shut off computer
monitors when they leave the office.  Tokyo Electric  plans to boost its power capacity to 55,200
megawatts by the end of July from 49,000 megawatts today, and
further expand it to 56,200 megawatts by the end of August,
Watanabe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
