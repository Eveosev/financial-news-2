Asian stocks rose, with the key
regional index headed for its highest close in three weeks, amid
signs Greece may avoid defaulting on its debt, lessening a risk
to bank earnings, and after commodities gained.  Standard Chartered Plc. (2888) , the U.K.’s third-largest bank by
market value, gained 2 percent in Hong Kong on speculation Greek
lawmakers will pass budget cuts needed to secure international
financial aid.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining
company, jumped 1.8 percent after oil and metal prices climbed.
 Fanuc Corp. (6954) ,  Japan ’s biggest maker of industrial robots,
advanced 3.6 percent in  Tokyo  after the nation’s factory output
expanded at the fastest pace in more than 50 years.  “There’s less anxiety about the issues surrounding
Greece’s debt,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “Investors are starting to
move into riskier assets.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 1.3 percent to 133.04
as of 7:27 p.m. in Tokyo, headed for its highest close since
June 8. Almost four stocks rose for each that dropped on the
measure. The gauge tumbled 6.7 percent from this year’s high on
May 2 through yesterday, amid concern a slowing U.S. economy,
 Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis and  China ’s steps to curb
inflation will crimp earnings.  Greek Rescue  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average and South Korea’s Kospi
Index increased 1.5 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
advanced 1.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was little
changed after swinging between gains and losses and China’s
Shanghai Composite Index lost 1.1 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.2
percent today. The gauge advanced 1.3 percent yesterday in  New
York , rising to its highest level in three weeks, after Nike
Inc.’s earnings beat estimates and amid optimism Europe will
take action to prevent a Greek default.  Stocks extended gains ahead of a meeting in Berlin today
between the German Finance Ministry and the nation’s biggest
banks in search of an agreement on how creditors will contribute
to an aid package for  Greece , two people with knowledge of the
matter told Bloomberg. Greek lawmakers will vote today and
tomorrow on budget cuts and tax increases that European
officials have set as a condition for delivering bailout money.  Failure to resolve the crisis in Greece, which needs loans
from Europe and the International Monetary fund to cover 6.6
billion euros ($9.4 billion) of maturing bonds in August, may
further increase funding costs for banks, even when they don’t
own Greek bonds.  Lenders, Exporters Rise  Standard Chartered, a London-based bank that gets more than
half of revenue in the Asia Pacific, rose 2 percent to HK$198.30
in Hong Kong. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s
largest bank, advanced 1.1 percent to 382 yen.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the nation’s biggest lender
by market value, added 1.1 percent to A$51.37. Moody’s Investors
Services last month cut ratings for Australian banks because of
their reliance on debt markets for funding.  Exporters to Europe rebounded.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest camera maker by sales, advanced 2.1 percent to 3,820 yen
in Tokyo. Nintendo Co., which sells about a third of its Wii
game consoles and other products in Europe, rose 1.5 percent to
15,160 yen.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a Hong Kong-based clothier
that counts Europe as its main market, increased 2.6 percent to
HK$24.05 in Hong Kong.  Bosideng Surges  Bosideng International Holdings Ltd. (3998) , which sells jackets
in China, surged 14 percent to HK$2.45 in  Hong Kong , the biggest
advance on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The company said full-
year net income increased 18 percent from a year earlier to 1.28
billion yuan ($198 million).  Yue Yuen Industrial Holding Ltd., a maker of athletic shoes
that supplies Nike, climbed 1.4 percent to HK$25 in Hong Kong.
Nike yesterday said fourth-quarter net income rose 14 percent
from a year earlier to $594 million, or $1.24 a share. That beat
the $1.17 average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Raw material producers led gains by all 10 industry groups
on the benchmark regional index after rising crude oil and metal
prices boosted earnings prospects for miners and energy
explorers.  BHP Billiton increased 1.8 percent to A$43.15 in Sydney.
Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-biggest mining company by
sales, gained 1.5 percent to A$81.53. Inpex Corp., Japan’s
largest energy explorer, rose 2.1 percent to 589,000 yen in
Tokyo. Cnooc Ltd., China’s No 1. offshore oil producer, climbed
1.7 percent HK$17.84 in Hong Kong.  Oil, Metals  Crude oil for August delivery rose 2.5 percent yesterday,

yesterday, compared with a gain of 3.1 percent by the  S&P 500 
and a drop of 3.8 percent the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.5 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 13.1 times for the S&P 500 and 10.8
times for the Stoxx 600.  Japanese manufacturers and utilities advanced after
government data showed factory output increased 5.7 percent in
May from April, the biggest gain since 1953, as companies
reopened factory lines damaged by a record earthquake and
tsunami on March 11. The median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg was for a 5.5 percent gain.  Japan Quake  Fanuc surged 3.6 percent to 13,430 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
whose sales plunged 33 percent because of supply-chain
disruptions after the March temblor, gained 1.7 percent to 3,270
yen. Aisin Seiki Co., which supplies parts to Toyota, climbed
2.5 percent to 3,085 yen.  Tokyo Electric Power Co., operator of the Fukushima Dai-
Ichi plant crippled by the disaster, rose 2.9 percent to 325 yen
after the utility’s shareholders voted not to abandon the
nuclear power business.  Among stocks that declined, CJ CheilJedang Corp., South
Korea’s largest food manufacturer by market value, dropped 6.4
percent to 234,000 won, the steepest fall on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index, amid concern it’s paying too much for a stake in
Korea Express Co., the nation’s biggest logistics company.  CJ Cheiljedang and CJ Corp. are set to buy about 40 percent
of Korea Express after beating out a rival offer from a Posco-
Samsung Group venture. The partners bid about 2 trillion won
($1.86 billion), Korea Economic Daily reported, without saying
how it got the information. That’s more than double the market
value of the stake in the logistics company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
