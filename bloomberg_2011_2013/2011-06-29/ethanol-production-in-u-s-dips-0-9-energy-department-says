Ethanol production in the U.S.
decreased 0.9 percent to 893,000 barrels a day last week,
according to the Energy Department.  Stockpiles were little changed at 19.5 million barrels,
enough supply for 21.8 days, the department said.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
was little changed at 5.17 million barrels a day. Refiners
receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended
into the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery jumped 7 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $2.74 a gallon at 10:34 a.m. New York time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have climbed 15 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
