South Africa ’s mining industry
brought on a debate about nationalizing operations as it didn’t
do enough to boost black ownership and comply with the nation’s
Mining Charter, Business Day reported, citing Department of
Mineral Resources Director-General Sandile Nogxina.  A solution where outright nationalization is avoided can be
found, Nogxina told the Johannesburg-based newspaper. He
declined to provide more detail. The ruling  African National
Congress  will complete its study of other countries’ experiences
of nationalization by November, he told Business Day.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
