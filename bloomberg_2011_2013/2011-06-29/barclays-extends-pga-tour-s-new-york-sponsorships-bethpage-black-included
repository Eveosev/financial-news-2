Barclays Plc (BARC)  extended its
sponsorship of the  U.S. PGA Tour ’s New York-area  tournament 
through 2016, including two editions at Long Island’s Bethpage
State Park Black  course .  The London-based company’s contract was due to expire after
the 2012 tournament, which will now be staged at Bethpage, the
first public course to host a U.S. Open., the  PGA Tour  said in a
press release.  The tournament has rotated to courses around the New York
and northern  New Jersey  area since 2007. The 2011 event will be
played at Plainfield Country Club in Edison, New Jersey.  Bethpage Black, which will also host the 2016 Barclays
tournament, was designed by A.W. Tillinghast and opened in 1936.
It was the site of Tiger Woods’s three-shot  U.S. Open  win in
2002 and Lucas Glover’s victory in 2009, when the tournament was
stretched to five days by rain.  The 2013 Barclays will be played at Liberty National Golf
Club in Jersey City, New Jersey, followed by Ridgewood Country
Club in Paramus, New Jersey, in 2014 and Plainfield in 2015.  Financial terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed by the
PGA Tour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
