Gold gained for a second day in  New
York  as a drop to a five-week low spurred some investors to buy
the metal as an alternative to currencies.  Futures touched $1,490.80 an ounce on June 27, the lowest
price since May 20. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou today
clinched enough votes to pass the first part of an austerity
plan aimed at meeting European Union aid requirements and
staving off a default.  “When gold gets to a reasonable level, we do see the
buyers come in,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC
in Chicago, said today by phone. “Just because of the  Greece 
vote, it doesn’t mean that Greece has solved all its problems.
All of the drivers for gold remain.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose $10.20, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $1,510.40 at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The price gained 0.3 percent yesterday.  Prices are up 6.3 percent in 2011 after climbing the past
10 years.  Europe ’s debt crisis helped futures reach a record
$1,577.40 on May 2. Greece is trying to avoid the euro area’s
