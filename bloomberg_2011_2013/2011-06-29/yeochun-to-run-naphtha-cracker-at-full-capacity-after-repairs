Yeochun NCC Co. has been running its
No. 1 cracker in Yeosu,  South Korea , at a reduced rate of 70
percent since June 25, and plans to operate at full capacity on
July 1, according to a company official.  The cracker, capable of producing 857,000 metric tons a
year of ethylene from naphtha, had to be taken offline on June
25 because of a technical glitch, said the official, who asked
not to be identified as the company doesn’t disclose such
information.  The company’s two remaining crackers in Yeosu are running
at full capacity, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
