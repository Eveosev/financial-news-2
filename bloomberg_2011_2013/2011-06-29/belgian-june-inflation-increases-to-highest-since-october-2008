Belgian inflation accelerated to 3.7
percent in June, the highest in more than 2 Â½ years, boosted by
higher energy prices, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in
Brussels said today in an e-mailed statement.  The increase in consumer prices accelerated from 3.4
percent in May, according to the ministry. Excluding energy,
inflation quickened to 1.9 percent from 1.7 percent as the cost
of fresh fruit increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
