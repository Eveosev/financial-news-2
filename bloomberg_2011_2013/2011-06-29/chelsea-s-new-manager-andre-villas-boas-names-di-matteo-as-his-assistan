the media at Stamford Bridge in  London  today.  Di Matteo is a former Chelsea player who scored in the

the 1997 F.A. Cup final.  Villas-Boas, 33, was named as the Premier League club’s new
manager on June 22, a day after exercising a break clause in his
contract with Porto. His departure entailed a payment of 15
million euros ($21.6 million) to the Portuguese club, according

second to  Manchester United  in soccer’s Premier League  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
