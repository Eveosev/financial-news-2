Gasoline jumped to a two-week high
after the Energy Department reported that U.S. stockpiles of the
motor fuel fell unexpectedly last week and imports slid to the
lowest level in 15 weeks.  Futures rose 4.2 percent as stockpiles dropped 1.43 million
barrels to 213.2 million, the biggest loss in nine weeks. The
median forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was
for a gain of 775,000 barrels. Daily gasoline imports dropped 21
percent to an average 683,000 barrels, the fewest since the week
ended March 11.  “The market is focused on the headline inventory number,”
said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in
 New York . “The market doesn’t care about why it fell. The
market doesn’t care about demand.”  Gasoline for July delivery rose 12.01 cents to settle at
$3.0097 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
largest gain since May 9. The more actively traded August
contract gained 11.93 cents to $2.9349. July gasoline and
heating oil futures expire at the end of floor trading tomorrow.  Futures were up a third day before the report as Greek
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won approval for the first part
of an austerity plan that may ward off default and quell fears
of a broader European debt crisis. The Greek Parliament passed
Papandreou’s 78 billion-euro package of budget cuts and asset
sales, crucial to receiving further international financial aid.  ‘Sigh of Relief’  “Passage of the austerity budget will make some breathe a
sigh of relief that the debt crisis would not spread throughout
the  euro zone  and result in a slower economy throughout the
region,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC
in Houston.  Gasoline stockpiles in U.S. East Coast, or Padd 1 region,
fell 1.7 percent to 55.3 million barrels, 8.1 percent below a
year earlier. Supplies of reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, in the
region were 27 percent lower than in 2010, department data
showed. The Nymex futures contract reflects RBOB delivered to
New York Harbor.  The inventory decline came as imports and production
dropped. Plants reduced refinery rates 1.1 percentage points to
88.1 percent, cutting output of the motor fuel by 4.7 percent to
the lowest level in seven weeks. Imports were 34 percent below a
year earlier.  ‘Uneconomical’ Imports  “Brent strength is making it uneconomic to import gasoline
and domestic production overall is basically flat,” said  Sander Cohan , an analyst with Energy Security Analysis Inc. in
Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “The report is bullish because you’ve
lost the import stream and domestic production hasn’t moved into
the gap yet.”  Gasoline and heating oil premiums over crude oil on Nymex
increased as  Brent crude  on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange
gained more than West Texas Intermediate oil. Refineries on the
East Coast, where Nymex gasoline futures are delivered,
primarily use oil from Europe and West Africa, which are priced
versus Brent.  The August gasoline crack spread increased $3.13 to $28.50
a barrel on the exchange, while the August heating oil crack
spread gained $2.04 to $28.49.  The WTI-Brent spread, based on August futures, was $17.63 a
barrel, up from $15.89 yesterday.  Gasoline demand, measured by deliveries to wholesalers,
fell to a three-week low of 9.26 million barrels a day. On a
four-week average, consumption was 0.3 percent below a year
earlier.  “Demand is dropping but gasoline is the item people are
going to want to own and buy,” said  Gordon Elliott , a risk
management specialist at INTL FC Stone LLC in  St. Louis Park ,
 Minnesota .  Distillate Supplies  Supplies of heating oil and diesel increased 258,000
barrels to 142.3 million, a six-week high. The survey projected
a rise of 1.05 million barrels. Demand for industrial, trucking
and home-heating fuels climbed 3.9 percent to 3.55 million
barrels a day, the first gain in five weeks.  Regular gasoline at the pump fell 0.8 cent to $3.543 a
gallon yesterday, according to AAA data. That’s the lowest level
since March 18.  Heating oil for July delivery rose 9.45 cents, or 3.3
percent, to settle at $2.9202 a gallon. The August contract
gained 9.32 cents to $2.9347.  To contact the reporter on this story:
