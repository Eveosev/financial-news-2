New Zealand rugby captain  Richie McCaw  was named to start for the Canterbury Crusaders in their
July 2 Super Rugby semifinal against South Africa’s Stormers.  McCaw, who hasn’t played since the May 29 loss to the
Queensland Reds because of a foot injury, replaces Matt Todd at
openside flanker in the only change to the team that beat the
Sharks 36-8 last weekend.  “I expect him to last,” Crusaders coach Todd Blackadder
told the Christchurch-based Press newspaper. “He’s one of those
guys who just does so much training that he’s mentally strong.”  The match in Cape Town will be the seven-time champion
Crusaders’ fourth semifinal in South Africa in five seasons.
They lost the previous three to the Bulls.  CRUSADERS: Tom Marshall, Sean Maitland, Robbie Fruean,
Sonny Bill Williams, Zac Guildford,  Dan Carter , Andy Ellis,
Kieran Read, Richie McCaw (captain), George Whitelock, Sam
Whitelock, Brad Thorn, Owen Franks, Corey Flynn, Wyatt Crockett.  RESERVES: Quentin MacDonald,  Ben Franks , Luke Romano, Matt
Todd, Kahn Foutali’i, Matt Berquist, Ryan Crotty.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
