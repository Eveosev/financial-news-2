Corn advanced for a second day,
extending the biggest gain in almost three months, and soybeans
rose on declining crop conditions in the U.S., the biggest
exporter of both commodities.  U.S. corn was rated 68 percent good or excellent as of June
26, down from 73 percent a year earlier, the Department of
Agriculture said this week. Sixty-five percent of soybeans
earned top ratings, down from 67 percent in 2010, USDA data
show.  “Crop conditions in the U.S. have deteriorated from the
previous week,” Rabobank International said in a report today.
Lower crop ratings are “providing some support to soybeans. The
focus is now on crop conditions and their evolution, rather than
planting progress,” analysts including Luke Chandler said.  Corn for December delivery climbed 16.5 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $6.695 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by
1:15 p.m. London time. The price gained 4.2 percent yesterday,
the biggest single-day rise for the most-active contract since
April 1.  Soybeans for November delivery climbed 15.25 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $13.3425 a bushel in Chicago. The price has risen
1.9 percent this week, gaining for three straight days.  “Supply concerns are starting to come to the fore again,”
 Michael Creed , an agribusiness economist at the  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , said by phone from  Melbourne  today.
“There’s still a fair bit of weather-related risk” to the next
global harvests of corn, soybeans and wheat, he said.  Stockpile Reports  Prices also may be rising ahead of the USDA’s annual
acreage and quarterly stockpile reports set to be released
tomorrow, Rabobank said. Corn futures jumped 29.5 cents, or 8.6
percent, on June 30 last year after the acreage report found
farmers planted less than intended and the stockpiles report
showed inventories were smaller than expected.  “Our fundamental analysis suggests prices should mirror
the 2010 price action with a shift higher,” Rabobank said in
its report.  Wheat futures advanced for a second day, extending the
biggest daily gain for the most-active contract since May 18.
The contract for September delivery rose 16.75 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $6.885 a bushel in  Chicago . Milling wheat for
November delivery gained 9.25 euros, or 4.7 percent, to 204.25
euros ($294.55) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris.  To contact the reporters on this story:
