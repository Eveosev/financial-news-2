The French government’s decision to
not allow an increase in natural-gas prices on July 1 will hurt
the functioning of the gas market,  Le Figaro  reported, citing
the country’s energy regulator.  According to the current system used to determine gas
prices in  France , tariffs should rise by an average of 7.1
percent from next month, the newspaper cited the Commission de
Regulation de l’Energie as saying. It will now be
“imperative” that prices increase from Oct. 1, the regulator
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
