The German government plans to
introduce carbon-dioxide emissions certificates for all fuels in
2015, the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing
unidentified officials.  Under the rule change, merchants selling heating oil,
natural gas or wood pellets would have to buy certificates and
might pass on the costs to consumers, the newspaper said.
Officials from the ministries in charge of finance, the economy,
construction and the environment will discuss details of the
proposal after the summer break, according to the FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
