Ethiopian officials arrested nine
people, including two journalists, on charges of terrorism, said
 Shimeles Kemal , state minister for communications.  They are accused of “organizing a terrorist structure to
destroy, demolish and sabotage essential power and
telecommunications infrastructure,” he said by phone today from
 Addis Ababa , the capital. The arrests took place last week. They
have “nothing to do with viewpoints they have published,” said
Shimeles.  The arrests “should be viewed as a strong measure by the
government to protect freedom of speech,” since they are
connected to alleged plots to destroy telecommunications
infrastructure, he said. Two members of the opposition Ethiopian
National Democratic Party were among those detained, Shimeles
said.  Ethiopia “has a well-documented history of using false
charges to jail critical journalists and force detainees to sign
false confessions,” said Mohamed Keita, a spokesman for the New
York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, in an e-mailed
response to questions today. “Ethiopia trails only Eritrea as
Africa’s foremost jailer of journalists.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
