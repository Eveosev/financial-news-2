Yields on most Brazilian interest-
rate futures contracts rose after policy makers signaled that a
fifth interest rate increase this year won’t be enough to slow
inflation to its 4.5 percent target in 2012.  The yield on the contract due in January, the most-traded
today in Sao Paulo, increased three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 12.44 percent at 5 p.m. New York time. The
yield on the contract due in January 2013, the second-most
traded, widened four basis points to 12.59 percent.  The real gained for a third straight day, strengthening 0.5
percent to 1.5677 percent per  U.S. dollar , from 1.5759
yesterday. Earlier in the day the currency rose to 1.5667, the
highest level in two months. It reached 1.5656 on April 29.  Brazil ’s central bank forecast in its quarterly inflation
report today that consumer prices would rise 4.9 percent in 2012
and slow to target in the second quarter of 2013 if it increases
the benchmark interest rate in July to 12.50 percent and the
real weakens. Policy makers estimated in March that inflation,
which ran at 6.55 percent in the 12 months through May, would
slow to 4.6 percent by the end of next year, under the so-called
market scenario.  “The central bank’s projections increased from the last
report,”  Luciano Rostagno , the chief strategist at Sao Paulo-
based CM Capital Markets, said by telephone from Sao Paulo.
“The market sees the possibility that the bank will go beyond
12.5 percent.”  12.25 Percent  Policy makers led by central bank President Alexandre Tombini have raised benchmark borrowing costs four times this
year by a total of 1.5 percentage points to 12.25 percent in
order to tame inflation which is above the ceiling of the
central bank’s target range of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points.  Traders, who expect the central bank to increase the Selic
by a quarter point to 12.50 percent at its July meeting, are
split whether policy makers will raise again in August or pause,
according to Bloomberg estimates based on interest rate futures.  Policy makers today forecast in all three inflation
outlooks -- the reference, the market and the alternative
scenarios -- that consumer prices will only meet the target in
the second quarter of 2013.  The central bank slowed the pace of interest-rate increases
to a quarter point in April, after half-point increases at its
two previous meetings.  Policy makers also said they twice bought dollars in the
spot currency market today, first at 1.5694 reais and then at
1.5713 each. The purchases are part of an effort by policy
makers to curb the currency’s 25-percent rally over two years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
