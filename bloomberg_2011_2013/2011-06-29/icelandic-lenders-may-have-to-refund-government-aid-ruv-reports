Icelandic lenders may be required to
refund the government’s financial aid,  RUV  reported, citing Per
Andreas Bjorgan, a director with the European Free Trade
Association’s Surveillance Authority.  The EFTA watchdog ruled today that a mortgage-loan program
operated by the government-owned Housing Finance Fund entailed
prohibited state aid to Icelandic financial institutions under
European Union rules, since the program didn’t have a limit in
size and scope, or a clearly marked timeframe, RUV said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
