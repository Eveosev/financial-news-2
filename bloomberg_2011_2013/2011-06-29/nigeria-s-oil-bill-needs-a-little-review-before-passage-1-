Nigeria  needs to review a new bill
which will regulate how the government runs the oil industry of
Africa’s top producer before it is passed into law by
parliament, a former energy minister said.  Energy companies’ concerns that the proposed law will make
investments in deep water oil fields unprofitable have been
addressed, former energy minister Diezani Alison-Madueke told
lawmakers today in Abuja, the capital. The bill still needs “a
certain amount of reviewing” before it is passed, she said.  Alison-Madueke and seven others were approved by parliament
as ministers in President Goodluck Jonathan’s new cabinet,
according to today’s proceedings.  The Petroleum Industry Bill, which will reform the way the
oil industry is funded and regulated, has been in the
legislature for more than two years, stalling new projects in
the industry as producers including  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and
 Total SA (FP)  backed away from investment until the law is passed.  Nigeria is the fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports.
Shell, Exxon Mobil Corp.,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , Total and  Eni SpA (ENI)  run
joint ventures with the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum
Corp. that pumps about 90 percent of the country’s crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
