HomeAway Inc., the vacation-rental
website that just raised $216 million in an initial public
offering, expects more customers to visit the site following the
share sale, Chief Executive Officer Brian Sharples said.  “The reason we took the company public is even though we
have a great company, most consumers around the world have never
heard of the business,” Sharples said in an interview today.
“By taking the company public, presuming this is a successful
IPO, it really puts the business on the map.”  HomeAway isn’t “one of these rocketship internet companies
that has superhigh growth and potentially an uncertain future,”
he said. “HomeAway is really a very, very
predictable business. We have been an above average growth
company but very stable in terms of our growth year to year.”  The Austin, Texas-based company sold 8 million shares at
$27 apiece, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. HomeAway
offered 8 million shares for $24 to $27, according to a
regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
