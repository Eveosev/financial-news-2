Ghana ’s five-year borrowing costs
are poised to fall to 14 percent at the first auction of the
debt in 3 1/2 years as inflation pressures ease, according to
Databank Financial Services Ltd.  “Slowing inflation gives support to stabilizing the
currency,” Sampson Akligoh, an economist at the Accra-based
brokerage, said by phone yesterday. “With a stable currency,
investors know they can cash back their investments at any time
without the value being eroded.”  Ghana last sold a five-year bond in June 2007 at a yield of
15 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. An issue
that will mature in December yields 14.47 percent and another
bond due in December 2012 is 13.67 percent.  Inflation slowed for the third consecutive month to 8.9
percent in May, from 9 percent in April, the Ghana Statistical
Service said June 15. The domestic currency, the cedi,
strengthened 3.9 percent against the dollar after it depreciated
to its weakest since at least 1994 in February, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It strengthened less than 0.1
percent to 1.5163 per dollar by 12:34 p.m. in Accra, the
capital.  “An environment of volatile exchange rates is what puts
investors off,” Emmanuel Nambware, a bond trader at  Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN) ’s Ghanaian unit, said by phone yesterday. He
projected five-year borrowing costs at 13.5 percent.  The Bank of  Ghana  will sell 300 million cedis ($197.7
million) of the debt to raise money for roads in Accra and
Kumasi, the second-biggest city, Adams Nyinaku, head of treasury
at the  central bank  said by phone yesterday. The date of the
sale will be decided by the end of the week, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
