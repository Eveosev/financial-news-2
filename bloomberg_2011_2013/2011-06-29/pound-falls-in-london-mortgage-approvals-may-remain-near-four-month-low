U.K. government bonds fell for a
third day after Greek lawmakers voted in favor of an austerity
plan needed to avoid default, boosting investor appetite for
higher-yielding assets.  The declines raised 10-year gilt yields to the highest in
three weeks, widening the spread over two-year note yields to
the most since August. The pound recovered from an almost two-
month low against the euro after Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  clinched 155 votes in the 300-seat  parliament , enough
to pass the first part of an austerity plan aimed at meeting
European Union requirements for further aid.  “There’s a bit more appetite for risk today, and we’re
seeing strong moves in equities, so naturally bonds will sell
off in that environment,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income
strategist at Credit Agricole SA in  London . “There’s a bit more
optimism about the Greek situation.”  The 10-year gilt yield rose six basis points to 3.33
percent as of 4:55 p.m. in London, after reaching 3.36 percent,
the most since June 8. The 3.75 percent security due September
2020 fell 0.515, or 5.15 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,602) face
amount, to 103.33. The yield on the two-year note added two
basis points to 0.81 percent.  European stocks rose as Papandreou remained on course to
secure a bill setting out the strategy for a 78 billion-euro
($112 billion) package of budget cuts and asset sales. The vote,
overshadowed by a 48-hour strike, became the target of protests
outside the parliament building that saw the police fire tear
gas at demonstrators.  Stocks Rise  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose for a third day, adding 1.7
percent for the longest winning streak in almost two months.
German 10-year bunds fell for a third day.  “Gilts are really moving in line with what bunds are
doing; they’re selling off because there’s a bit less of a safe-
haven demand,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income analyst at
Evolution Securities Ltd. in London.  The pound strengthened against the dollar for a third day,
adding 0.4 percent to $1.6072. Britain’s currency was little
changed at 89.79 pence per euro, after losing as much as 0.4
percent to 90.15 pence, the weakest intraday level since May 5.  British banks granted 45,900 home loans last month,
compared with 45,400 in April, the  Bank of England  said today.
Economists had forecast an increase to 46,300.  The U.K. central bank has held its benchmark rate at a
record low of 0.5 percent since April 2009 to support growth
even as inflation accelerated to 4.5 percent in May, more than
twice the government’s 2 percent target.  The pound has fallen 9 percent in the past 12 months,
making it the second-worst performer among 10 developed-market
currencies after the  U.S. dollar , according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
