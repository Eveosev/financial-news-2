Colombia ’s peso gained after the
Greek parliament approved austerity measures needed to win
European bailout funds and stave off default, boosting demand
for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 1,779.50 per dollar at
3:10 p.m. New York time, from 1,781.94 yesterday. The peso has
gained 7.2 percent this year, the best performer among the six
most-traded Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “The mood in international markets is of lower  risk
aversion  as we’re kind of absorbing the news from  Greece ,” said
Daniel Lozano, an analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Serfinco SA.
The peso also rose as the country advanced toward a trade
agreement with the U.S., he said.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  clinched enough
votes today to pass the first part of an austerity plan aimed at
meeting European Union aid requirements. President Barack Obama
won support of the largest U.S. business lobbying groups
yesterday for his plan to attach aid for displaced workers to
stalled trade deals with Colombia,  South Korea , and Panama.  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said today Colombia
will continue to “combat” the peso’s appreciation.  In April, Echeverry announced that the government would
create an overseas fund with as much as $1.2 billion from
dollars bought in the local  spot market  through the end of 2011,
and forgo repatriating funds from abroad for the rest of the
year. That comes on top of the central bank’s plans to buy a
minimum of $20 million daily until at least Sept. 30.  Echeverry also said today that Colombia may sell bonds in
 Asia  this year or next. The government last sold bonds in Asia
in 2009, when it issued 45 billion yen-denominated bonds ($556
million).  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.77 percent,
according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The security’s price
fell 0.092 centavo to 117.881 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
