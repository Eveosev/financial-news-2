New York Governor  Andrew Cuomo  gets
a positive job-approval rating from almost two-thirds of voters
after a legislative session that included an on-time budget with
reduced spending, tighter rules on ethics, a property tax cap
and passage of his bill to legalize same-sex marriage.  Voters approved of Cuomo’s first six months in office 64
percent to 19 percent, matching his previous best reached in
April, according to the survey by Quinnipiac University. The
positive feedback is the highest for a New York governor since
July 2002, when George Pataki’s approval rating stood at 66
percent to 18 percent.  The  latest poll , conducted June 20 to June 26, spanned a
period in which the Democratic governor built a coalition of
state senators that included four Republicans and all but one
member of his party to win a 33-29 vote passage of a law making
same-sex marriage legal.  “Cuomo has the same economic problems as governors in
other states polled by  Quinnipiac University , but somehow he
outscores them all,” said  Maurice Carroll , director of the
 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute  in Hamden,  Connecticut .
“The governor’s job approval is more than double the level of
the Legislature.”  White Catholic voters approve of Cuomo, 53, by almost
three-to-one, or 62 percent to 22 percent, and Republicans gave
him positive marks, 53 percent to 26 percent. Catholic
Archbishop Timothy Dolan opposed Cuomo on the gay-marriage bill.  Cuomo’s appeal among voters ran higher than several other
first-term governors, according to the institute. New Jersey’s
 Chris Christie  had a 44 percent to 47 percent rating as of June
21; Florida’s  Rick Scott , 29 percent to 57 percent as of May 25;
and Ohio’s  John Kasich , 38 percent to 49 percent as of May 18.  The survey consisted of 1,317 telephone interviews on cell
and landlines with registered voters, and had a margin of error
of 2.7 percentage points, the institute said in a news release.  To contact the reporters on this story:
