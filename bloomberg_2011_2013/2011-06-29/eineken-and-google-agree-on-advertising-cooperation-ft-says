Heineken NV (HEIA)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG)  have
agreed to cooperate on digital advertising, including YouTube
video and mobile adverts, in a deal that will cover more than 20
international markets, the Financial Times reported.  The agreement will give Heineken access to special
consultancy, data and discounts in exchange for committing to a
minimum amount of advertising investment across Google’s sites,
the FT said. Heineken sees the partnership as providing “a
competitive advantage,” the FT said, citing Alexis Nasard,
Heineken’s chief commercial officer, speaking to the newspaper
last week at the Cannes Lions advertising festival.  To contact the reporter on this story:
