New Zealand ’s economy is being
bolstered by high prices for its milk, meat and lumber exports,
which are underpinning demand for the nation’s currency, central
bank Governor Alan Bollard said.  “Rising commodity prices are improving export incomes but
putting pressure on the  exchange rate ,” Bollard said in a
statement on the  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand  website .  The currency has gained 8.2 percent the past three months,
the second-best performing G-10 currency after the Swiss franc.
The higher exchange rate reduces the returns from exports, which
make up 30 percent of the economy, and particularly overseas
sales of manufactured goods that don’t benefit from commodity
prices movements, Bollard said earlier this month.  The central bank was commenting after publishing its annual
Statement of Intent, which outlines its priorities and focus
over the next three years.  “We expect the New Zealand economy to be driven by
continued growth in our East Asia and Australian trading
partners,” Bollard said today. “High commodity prices have
become an important engine of growth, but we expect price
volatility will pose challenges for monetary policy.”  Rising oil and food prices, fanned by international
political instability and global demand growth and supply
disruptions, “are starting to cause significant inflation
concerns,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
