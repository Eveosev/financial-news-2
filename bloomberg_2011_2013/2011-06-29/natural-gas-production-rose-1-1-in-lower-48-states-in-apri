Natural gas production in the
continental U.S. increased 1.1 percent in April as output from
 Louisiana  rose, the Energy Department said.  Production climbed to 69.05 billion cubic feet a day from a
revised 68.33 billion in March, the department’s Energy
Information Administration said in the monthly  EIA-914  report.  Total U.S. production, including  Alaska , gained 0.5 percent
to 78.58 billion cubic feet a day from a revised 78.16 billion,
according to the department. Output in Louisiana gained 2
percent to 8.15 billion cubic feet a day, and in  Oklahoma 
increased 1.8 percent to 5.15 billion.  “Drilling activities in the Haynesville and Marcellus
shale plays are largely responsible for the gains in Louisiana
and other states,” the department said.  Production in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico dropped
1.4 percent to 5.44 billion cubic feet a day, the department
said.  The EIA-914 report covers gas gross withdrawals, which
include gas used for repressuring, quantities vented and flared,
and non-hydrocarbon gas removed in treating or processing
operations.  Natural gas for August delivery fell 2.7 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $4.327 million British thermal units as of 12:32
p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices have dropped
1.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
