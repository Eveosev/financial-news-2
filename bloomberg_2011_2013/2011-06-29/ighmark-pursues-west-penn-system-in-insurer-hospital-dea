Highmark Inc., a private U.S.
insurer, is pursuing an affiliation with a hospital system based
in Pittsburgh to help lower costs and improve coordination in
health care.  Highmark , also based in Pittsburgh, would provide $50
million to the system immediately and invest as much as $475
million over the next four years under the terms of the deal,
West Penn Allegheny Health System said in a  statement  on its
website yesterday. Highmark operates Blue Cross and Blue Shield
plans in  Pennsylvania  and  West Virginia , and employs more than
19,500 people nationally, according to its website.  The managers and boards of the insurer and the health
system are continuing talks aimed at reaching a final agreement.  The Wall Street Journal reported the deal earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
