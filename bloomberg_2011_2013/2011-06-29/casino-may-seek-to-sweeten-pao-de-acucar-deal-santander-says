Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO)  may
seek better terms in a proposal to merge the Brazilian assets of
 Carrefour SA (CA)  with Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de
Acucar, which Casino partly owns, Banco Santander SA said.  Casino “could start negotiations in order to sweeten the
deal to its benefit,” Santander analyst Tobias Stingelin wrote
in a note to clients today.  The Saint-Etienne, France-based company may also veto the
deal, potentially hurting Pao de Acucar shares after they surged
13 percent yesterday to 73.25 reais, Stingelin wrote. Other
risks include a “prolonged fight among controlling
shareholders” and antitrust regulations, he wrote.  Banco BTG Pactual SA investment fund Gama proposed the deal
yesterday, setting up a power struggle with Casino, which called
the plan “illegal.” Casino owns a 37 percent stake in Pao de
Acucar and would gain control of the company next year under a
2005 accord.  The current proposal may imply a valuation for the combined
company of 92 reais a share, Stingelin wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
