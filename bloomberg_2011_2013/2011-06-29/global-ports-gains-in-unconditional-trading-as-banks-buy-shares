Global Ports Investments Plc, which
handles more than a quarter of fuel exports from  Russia , gained
on its first day of unconditional trading in  London  as the banks
that advised on its initial public offering exercised an option
to buy shares.  The shares added 0.9 percent to $17.25 by 8:47 a.m. in
London after climbing 14 percent in the previous three days.  The IPO raised about $588 million after banks fully
exercised an option to buy shares, according to a statement from
the company today. The bookrunners bought about 10.7 million
shares, or 10 percent of the base offering, from a shareholder.
That increased the size of the June 24 IPO by about $53.5
million, from $534 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
