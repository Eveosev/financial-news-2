U.S. stock-index futures pared
gains after Greek lawmakers approved an austerity package needed
to avoid default.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  advanced 3.1 percent in early New
York trading after agreeing to pay $8.5 billion to settle claims
from institutional investors over defective mortgages.  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  rose 2.1 percent as BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research
advised buying the shares of the third-biggest U.S. lender by
sales.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September gained 0.2 percent to 1,297.5 at 9:15 a.m. in New
York. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures advanced 15 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 12,156.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  secured the approval
of the country’s parliament to pass budget cuts and tax
increases needed to win the next tranche of financial aid from
the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund .  Papandreou quelled dissent from within the ruling Pasok
party to win a majority in the 300-seat Greek parliament to
deliver the 78 billion-euro ($112 billion) austerity package.
The opposition Democratic Alliance said late yesterday that its
five lawmakers should vote “according to their conscience,”
taking into account “the immediate danger of bankruptcy facing
the country.”  A report at 10 a.m. New York time may show that pending
sales of U.S. homes increased 3 percent in May, according to the
average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Transactions plunged 12 percent in April.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
