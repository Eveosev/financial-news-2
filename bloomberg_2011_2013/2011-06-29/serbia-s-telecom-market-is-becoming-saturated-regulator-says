Growth of  Serbia ’s telecom market is
slowing even as the economy shakes off recession, the country’s
agency for electronic communications said.  The market nominally grew 6.4 percent last year to 151.1
billion dinars ($2.12 billion), the Agency for Electronic
Communications said in its annual  analysis  published today. The
market comprising fixed and mobile phone services, media content
distribution, Internet services and voice-over-Internet-protocol
had average annual growth of 13.9 percent in the four preceding
years.  Expansion and further liberalization of the industry is a
priority for the government as it seeks to begin membership
talks with the European Union. Serbia failed to sell
Telekom Srbija AD, the former monopoly, earlier this year when
the only bidder,  Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , offered less than the
asking price of 1.4 billion euros ($2 billion) for a controlling
stake.  Mobile phone services remained the biggest part of
telecommunication services in 2010 with 52.7 percent, even as
the number of subscribers in the category was little changed at
9.92 million compared with 9.91 million in 2009.  This “indicates the market is becoming saturated,” the
government agency said. “The average annual rate of growth has
slowed” after the revenue from mobile services expanded an
average 20 percent a year from 2003 to 2009. Serbia’s economy
grew 1.8 percent in 2010 after contracting more than 3 percent
in 2009.  Land Lines  The number of land lines was little changed, reaching 3.11
million from 3.1 million in 2009 in a country of 7.4 million
inhabitants, though revenue in the category increased to 43.6
billion dinars from 41.1 billion dinars due to higher rates
approved by the agency.  The dinar depreciation of almost 11 percent in 2010 hurt
the results of the three mobile networks on the market,  MT:S 
owned by Serbia’s state-run Telekom Srbija AD, a local  unit  of
 Telenor ASA (TEL)  and  VIP Mobile  owned by  Telekom Austria .  Telekom Srbija’s mobile arm remained the biggest provider
in the segment, even as its market share fell to 56 percent from
59.7 percent by number of subscribers and to 43.7 percent from
50.7 percent by revenue.  The Telenor unit and VIP Mobile and increased their market
share to 30.3 percent and 13.7 percent respectively by client
base and to 42.4 percent and 13.9 percent by revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
