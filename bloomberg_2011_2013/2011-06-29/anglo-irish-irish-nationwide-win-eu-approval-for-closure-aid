Anglo Irish Bank  Corp. and Irish
 Nationwide Building Society  won European Union approval for
Irish government aid to help pay for their closure.  The European Commission authorization allows the banks to
be merged and wound down over the next 10 years to compensate
for state guarantees and some 34.7 billion euros ($50 billion)
in capital injections to cover losses on property loans.  “Today, the state aid chapter on Anglo Irish Bank and INBS
has been finally closed,”  Joaquin Almunia , the EU’s antitrust
commissioner, said in an e-mailed statement. “The distortions
of competition caused by the enormous aid they have received is
satisfactorily addressed by their exit from the market.”  Ireland may spend as much as 100 billion euros to solve
 Europe ’s worst banking crisis, including 29.3 billion euros
injected into Anglo Irish, which was nationalized in 2009 as
loan losses soared. The country, forced into an international
bailout in November, is struggling to convince investors its
debt is sustainable after the collapse of a domestic real-estate
bubble in 2007.  “Today’s decision allows us and the Irish government to
focus on the future of the Irish banking system,” Almunia said.  The Brussels-based commission is responsible for checking
whether government subsidies to companies harm competition in
the 27-nation EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
