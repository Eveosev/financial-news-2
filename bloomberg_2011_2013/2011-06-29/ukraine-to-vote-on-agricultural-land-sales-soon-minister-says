Some Ukrainian proposals to lift the
ban on selling agricultural land in the country are expected to
be voted on before Parliament’s summer recess, Mykola Bezuhlyi,
the first deputy agriculture minister said.  Companies currently lease plots from individual owners at a
price set by the government. There are around 6.5 million plots
in the country. Ukraine has 41.6 million hectares (103 million
acres) of agricultural land covering 69 percent of its
territory. Arable land accounts for 32.5 million hectares.  The proposed measures would stimulate an increase in
agricultural borrowing and would allow peasants to use land in
order to get bank loans, Bezuhlyi said according to a  statement 
published today on the government’s website.  The government’s last session before the summer break is on
July 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
