Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose,
pushing the yield to the lowest level in two months, on
speculation banks will boost purchases as a central bank ruling
on loans frees up cash for investment. The dong advanced.  Commercial banks must limit lending to “non-production
businesses” such as those investing in the stock and property
markets to 22 percent of loans by June 30 and to 16 percent by
the end of the year, the  State Bank  of Vietnam said in March.
There was no cap on loans earlier.  “Demand at banks is very high now since they have abundant
cash,” said Luu Hai Yen, a Hanoi-based analyst at Thang Long
Securities Joint-Stock Co. “Having good liquidity, banks have
been returning to the  bond market .”  Five-year bond yields fell eight basis points to 12.42
percent, the lowest level since April 22, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The dong rose 0.1 percent to 20,583 per dollar as of 3:07
p.m. in Hanoi, compared with 20,610 yesterday, according to
prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,618 today,
unchanged since June 10, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the official
rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Ven Ram, Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
