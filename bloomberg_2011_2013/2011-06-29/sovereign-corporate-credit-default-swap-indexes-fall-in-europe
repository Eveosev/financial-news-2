The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and bank debt fell on speculation  Greece ’s
government will approve austerity measures needed for a second
bailout and investors will agree to rollover their bond
holdings.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments dropped 6 basis points to 227 at
10 a.m. in London. A decline signals improvement in perceptions
of  credit quality .  Investors are betting approval of Prime Minister George Papandreou’s 78 billion-euro ($112 billion) austerity plan and a
rollover of fixed-income investments into fresh Greek debt will
buy the nation time to avoid default. A debt extension will
delay losses and allow banks to recapitalize, according to
Olivia Frieser, an analyst at BNP Paribas SA.  “A positive vote in Greece today, and these proposals,
would remove a significant risk in the near term,” London-based
Frieser wrote in a note. “But the Greek issue will be a chronic
one, so we wouldn’t get overly carried away on the news.”  Swaps on Greece tumbled 60 basis points to 1,992 basis
points, according to CMA. That’s down from a record 2,421 basis
points June 27, and still implies an 82 percent chance of
default within five years.  Contracts on Ireland dropped 23 basis points to 756,
 Portugal  declined 22 to 772 and  Italy  fell 11 to 180, while
 Spain  was 11 lower at 277 and  Belgium  was down 9 at 151.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers decreased 6.5 basis points to 165.5 and
the subordinated index dropped 10 to 288, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  Crossover Narrows  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 8
basis points to 417. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings declined 1.75 basis
points to 111.5 basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
