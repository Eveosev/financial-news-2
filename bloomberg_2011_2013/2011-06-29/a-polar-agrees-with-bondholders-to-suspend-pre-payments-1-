Bondholders of  Chile ’s  Empresas La
Polar SA (LAPOLAR)  agreed on a waiver of bond covenants that allows the
company to suspend pre-payments of debt after it increased bad-
loan provisions from fraudulent consumer-credit practices.  La Polar’s bondholders agreed “unanimously” on the 90-day
waiver following a meeting with the board in Santiago today, the
company said in a statement.  “There is a general agreement among creditors, suppliers
and customers to give La Polar a new opportunity,” Chairman
Cesar Barros told reporters today.  CorpGroup, controlled by Chilean banking and retail
entrepreneur Alvaro Saieh purchased a 10 percent stake in La
Polar, the company said in a statement e-mailed June 25, after
the retailer’s share price slumped more than 70 percent.  CorpGroup said in a June 26 statement it may purchase a
larger stake in La Polar if the company is able to reach an
agreement with shareholders and bondholders.  La Polar rose 5 percent, to 773.44 pesos at 4 p.m. in
Santiago today. The stock climbed 17 percent yesterday following
Saieh’s purchase, which made CorpGroup the largest shareholder
in the company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
