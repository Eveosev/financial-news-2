Westfield Group (WDC)  plans to start a 1
billion pound ($1.6 billion) redevelopment at a site it owns in
London’s White City area adjacent to its shopping center, as it
boosts its pipeline for projects amid a recovery in sales.  The company is now seeking public feedback on plans for the
redevelopment, which will include 1,700 homes and about 48,000
square meters (516,668 square feet) of retail space, the world’s
biggest shopping center operator by market value said in an e-
mailed release.  Westfield in May upgraded its development-starts forecast
for 2012 and 2013 as sales improved, and the spinoff of
Westfield Retail Trust enabled the company to focus more on new
projects. The company is planning a “sizeable expansion” of
Westfield  London , co-Chief Executive Director Steven Lowy said
at the time.  Westfield London’s revenue jumped almost 20 percent in the
first quarter, compared with a 0.9 percent rise in U.K.’s retail
sales. The mall, which opened in October 2008, a month after the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., said sales last year
climbed 19 percent, exceeding those at the company’s other
shopping centers in the country.  Westfield shares climbed 0.1 percent to A$8.67 at the 4:10
p.m. close of trading in Sydney.  Westfield will display plans for the development for public
consultation on July 8, 9 and 11, the company said. The land is
currently used as access roads for parking, service yards and
warehouses, it said.  While the development will be completed in stages, its
present value is about 1 billion pounds, the Sydney-based
company said.  Westfield will in September open the Stratford City
shopping center,  Europe ’s largest urban mall, close to the main
site of the 2012 Olympics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
