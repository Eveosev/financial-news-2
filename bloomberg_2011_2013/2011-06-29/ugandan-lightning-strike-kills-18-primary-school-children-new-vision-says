A lightning strike killed 18
primary-school children and injured 36 others at a school in
northwestern  Uganda , the  New Vision  reported, citing Patrick
Byaruhanga, a regional police commander.  The children died at Runyanya Primary School in the
Kiyandongo district, about 189 kilometers (117 miles) northwest
of the capital, Kampala, the newspaper said. They were waiting
in their classroom for a storm to pass when the lightning
struck, it said.  The deaths came as at least 37 children and two teachers
were wounded in another lightning strike at a school in Paidha
near the Congolese border, the newspaper said.  In the past “few weeks,” at least 40 people have died in
Uganda after being hit by lightning, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
