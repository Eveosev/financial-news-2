Polandâ€™s current-account deficit
reached 3.36 billion euros in the first quarter, the Warsaw-
based Narodowy Bank Polski said today.  The gap was narrower than the 4.15 billion-euro median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 17 economists. It compares
with a revised shortfall of 5.67 billion euros in the fourth
quarter after the central bank changed its accounting rules to
reduce the volume of unclassified transactions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
