The  European Central Bank  said it
has extended a dollar liquidity swap line with the U.S.  Federal
Reserve  through Aug. 1, 2012, and will continue to lend dollars
to euro-area banks.  “The Governing Council of the European Central Bank has
taken a decision, in coordination with the  Bank of Canada , the
 Bank of England  and the  Swiss National Bank , to extend the
liquidity swap arrangements with the Federal Reserve up to Aug.
1, 2012,” the Frankfurt-based ECB said in a statement. “The
Bank of  Japan  will consider a similar measure soon.”  The ECB said it will “continue to conduct U.S. dollar
liquidity-providing operations with a maturity of seven days.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
