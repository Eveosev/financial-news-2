Most African officials meeting at a
regional summit in Equatorial Guinea agree that Libyan leader
 Muammar Qaddafi  must leave power for a democratic transition to
take place, a U.K. government minister said.  An exit strategy for the conflict in the North African
country will be discussed by heads of state at the African Union
summit in Equatorial Guinea’s capital, Malabo, tomorrow. Foreign
ministers from the continent have been meeting in the city since
yesterday.  “Most of those AU foreign ministers have been telling me
privately that they feel that Qaddafi must go, that there’s no
future for Qaddafi in Libya,” U.K. Minister for the United
Nations and Africa Henry Bellingham said in an interview
yesterday in Malabo.  Members of a group of leaders mapping out the African
Union’s position on  Libya  on June 26 said hostilities in the
country should end and Qaddafi should not be part of
negotiations to decide a democratic transition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
