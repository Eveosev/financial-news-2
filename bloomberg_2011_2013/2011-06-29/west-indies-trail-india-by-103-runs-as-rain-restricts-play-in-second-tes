The West Indies reached 98-5 in
reply to top-ranked  India â€™s 201 as rain and bad light restricted
play on day two of the second cricket Test to 25.3 overs.  Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Marlon Samuels added an unbroken
41-run partnership to steady the home team in Bridgetown,
Barbados, after it had slumped to 57-5. Chanderpaul will resume
on 20, with Samuels 21 not out.  India, which leads the best-of-three series 1-0, has never
won two Tests in a series in the Caribbean. The final match is
scheduled July 6-10 in Dominica.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
