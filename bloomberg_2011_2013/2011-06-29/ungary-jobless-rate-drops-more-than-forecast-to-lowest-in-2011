Hungary’s jobless rate dropped more
than economists forecast in the March to May period,  the
statistics office  in Budapest said today in an e-mail.  The  unemployment rate  fell to 11 percent, the lowest since
October-December last year, from 11.5 percent in December-
February period. The median estimate of 10 economists in a
Bloomberg survey was 11.2 percent.  Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  has pledged to create
a million jobs in a decade in a bid to raise the European
Union’s second-lowest employment rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
