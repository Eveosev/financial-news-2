Sony Corp. (6758)  said it is cooperating
with a probe by the U.S. Justice Department’s antitrust division
as part of a wider investigation into competition in the
rechargeable battery business.  The Tokyo-based company’s U.S. subsidiary, Sony
Electronics, received the request for information on May 3,
Keita Sanekata said in an e-mailed statement. Sanekata declined
to comment further on the scope of the investigation disclosed
in an annual report filed today.  Lithium batteries account for the largest portion of the
global market for rechargeable batteries. They are used in
smartphones, personal computers, tablets and plug-in electric
vehicles. The largest battery makers cut prices in 2010 amid a
supply glut, according to the Institute of  Information
Technology , a Tokyo-based market research firm.  Manufacturers have announced plans to expand capacity to
meet demand for batteries in electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrid
cars. Sales will increase to 1.7 trillion yen ($21 billion) in
2020 from almost zero in 2009, Daiwa Securities Group Inc.
estimated in March 2010.  President  Barack Obama ’s administration has provided more
than $2.4 billion in grants and low-cost loans to battery makers
and auto companies to support projects intended to spur the
development and sale of rechargeable electric cars and plug-in
hybrids, as part of a 2009 stimulus package.  To contact the reporter on this story:
