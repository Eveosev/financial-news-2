Germany  and seven other net
contributors in the European Union are demanding “significant”
cuts to salaries and pensions of the region’s civil servants,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing a letter of the
countries to the European Commission.  The commission will present its proposals for a revision of
the civil-servant status in the region today or tomorrow, the
German newspaper reported. The suggestions will include lifting
the retirement age to 65, raising weekly working hours to 40 and
allowing member states to adjust civil servants’ pay increases
in times of a shrinking economy, FAZ said, citing unidentified
officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
