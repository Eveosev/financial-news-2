Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
biggest retailer, said its acquisition of a 51 percent stake in
South Africa’s  Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM)  isn’t affected by a local
labor union’s appeal against the transaction.  The appeal by the  South African Catering and Commercial
Workers’ Union  to South Africa’s Competition Appeal Court has no
impact on the deal’s implementation, Wal-Mart and Massmart said
today in a joint e-mailed statement.  Court spokeswoman Lerato Motaung confirmed that an appeal
notice has been received from the union. SACCAWU, as the union
is known, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment when
Bloomberg News called its head office in Johannesburg.  The union and the government jointly opposed the
acquisition, which has already been approved and implemented, on
the grounds that Wal-Mart’s entry into  South Africa  would
threaten local jobs and lead to a surge in imports.  “This is not an unexpected development and the companies
remain firm in their belief that the transaction rests on solid
legal ground,” Wal-Mart and Massmart said in the statement.  On June 20, Wal-Mart paid 16.5 billion rand ($2.4 billion)
to acquire the majority stake in the South African retailer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
