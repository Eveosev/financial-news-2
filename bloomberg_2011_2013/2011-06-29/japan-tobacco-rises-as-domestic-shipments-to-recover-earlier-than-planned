Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914)  rose the most in
almost two months in  Tokyo  trading after the company said it
planned to resume shipments earlier than previously announced
for all cigarette brands disrupted by the March 11 earthquake.  The world’s third-largest publicly traded cigarette maker
by volume climbed 4.5 percent to 313,000 yen at the 3 p.m. close
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, its biggest gain since May 2. The
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 1.5 percent.  Japan Tobacco will restore deliveries of all brands by July
18 instead of early August, as it had planned earlier, the
company  said  yesterday. The 9-magnitude earthquake and tsunami
forced Japan Tobacco to suspend all domestic shipments for 12
days, with cigarette brands gradually returning to production
after that.  “Japan Tobacco can finally move on,”  Mitsuo Shimizu , an
equity analyst at Cosmo Securities Co. in Tokyo, said by
telephone today. “The impact from the earthquake has started to
diminish.”  Domestic sales fell 38 percent to 7.2 billion cigarettes in
May, the Tokyo-based company said June 10. They plunged 81
percent in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
