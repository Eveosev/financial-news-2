Canadian exporters’ optimism about
their sales has increased since the end of last year, the
country’s export-finance arm said.  Export Development Canada ’s semi-annual  trade confidence
index  rose to 76.2 in a survey of 810 exporters, up from a
reading of 74.1 in a November survey, according to a statement
from the Ottawa-based agency. The index hit a record low of 61
in 2008.  “Canadian exporters are remarkably upbeat, considering the
fluctuations in the world economy,”  Peter Hall , the agency’s
chief economist, said in the statement.  EDC’s survey showed an increase in four of the five
components of the index: expectations over the coming six-month
period for domestic sales, export sales, domestic economic
conditions and international business opportunities. The global
economic conditions component was the only area where confidence
has waned, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
