A New York federal judge approved a
$153.6 million settlement by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  of allegations
by the Securities and Exchange Commission that the bank misled
investors in a mortgage securities transaction just as the
housing market was starting to plummet, according to court
records.  JPMorgan doesn’t admit or deny allegations in the
complaint, and will pay a civil penalty of $133 million, plus
$18.6 million repayment of its profits and $2 million in interest,
according to papers signed by Judge Richard M. Berman in Manhattan 
court today. Of the payments, $126 million will be for investors 
who bought notes in a product called Squared CDO 2007-1.  The order also states that JPMorgan and its employees are
barred from making money by “means of any untrue statement of a
material fact or any omission of a material fact” or engaging
in any transaction which “would operate as a fraud or deceit
upon the purchaser.”  JPMorgan shares rose as much as 93 cents, or 2.35 percent,
to $40.47 and were trading on the  New York  Stock Exchange at
$40.11, up 57 cents, as of 10:42 a.m.  The case is In re U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
JPMorgan Securities LLC; 11-cv-04206; Southern District of New
York (Foley Square).  To contact the reporter on this story:
