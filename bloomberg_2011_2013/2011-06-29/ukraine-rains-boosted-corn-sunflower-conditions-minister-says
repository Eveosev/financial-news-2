Rainfall in  Ukraine  this week helped
to improve the conditions of sunflower and corn crops, said
Mykola Bezuhlyi, first deputy agriculture minister.  “Rains in general had a positive impact on the future
harvest, especially for late crops like corn, sunflower and
soya,” Bezuhlyi said in a statement on the government  website .  Rain fell in almost all regions from the middle of June,
helping crops after dry weather in May and earlier this month.
Spring barley will be most damaged by the dryness, the country’s
Hydrometeorology Center has said. Rains caused grain losses in
the southern Odessa region amounting to tens of thousands of
hectares, he said, without being more specific.  Winter barley was harvested from 313,000 hectares (773,440
acres) as of today, the  Agriculture Ministry  said today in a
statement on its website. More than 890,000 metric tons of
barley was harvested. Barley yields increased to 2.86 tons a
hectare from 2.51 a year earlier.  Winter wheat yields increased to 3.34 tons a hectare from
2.52 tons a year earlier, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
