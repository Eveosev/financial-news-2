France  plans to spend 214 billion
 CFA francs  ($470 million) on development projects in Cameroon
between 2011 and 2016, said Ambassador Bruno Gain.  Agriculture projects will be given 128 billion CFA francs,
urban development and infrastructure will get 73 billion CFA
francs and professional training and other courses will receive
the rest, he told reporters in Yaounde, the capital, yesterday.  The money is part of a French program to reinvest canceled
debt into development projects. From 2006 to 2011, 351 billion
CFA francs was spent on Cameroonian projects, Gain said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
