The unexpected release of strategic
oil stocks by International Energy Agency countries last week
caused many traders and hedge funds that had bet on widening
spreads between different types of crude oil to suffer losses,
the Financial Times reported.  The price differential between lower quality Dubai crude
and premium-quality Brent crude almost halved in four days, to a
six-month low, the newspaper said.  The spread between the two reached a session high of $9.20
a barrel on June 15, the highest since October 2004; after the
release, the spread plummeted to $3.30 on June 27, the FT said.  When such a trend reversal occurs, “you know there is
going to be a lot of pain,” the FT cited Michael Guido, the
associate director of hedge-fund sales at Macquarie Group Ltd.
in  New York , as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
