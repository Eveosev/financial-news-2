The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars rose versus the majority of their 16 most-traded peers
as  Greece  approved an austerity plan to help head off the euro
region’s first sovereign-debt default, boosting risk appetite.  The South Pacific currencies gained for a second day
against the  U.S. dollar  as the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index of raw materials climbed 1.4 percent to 339.03, the
highest level in two weeks. The MSCI World Index of stocks
increased 1.5 percent.  “Risk appetite has stabilized and commodities are
firmer,” said  Richard Franulovich , a senior currency strategist
at Westpac Banking Corp. in New York. “It was a big relief for
the market; it looks like Greece is going to get its tranche to
avert a default.”  The Aussie climbed 1.2 percent to $1.0669 at 11:40 a.m. in
 New York , from $1.0541 yesterday, and reached $1.0680, the
strongest level since June 15. The currency rose 0.8 percent to
86.22 yen, after earlier increasing to 86.33 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, advanced 1.2
percent to 82.21 U.S. cents, from 81.21 cents. It appreciated
0.8 percent to 66.43 yen and touched 66.81 yen, the highest
since June 1.  Greek lawmakers voted 155-138 to pass Prime Minister George Papandreou’s 78 billion-euro ($113 billion) package of budget
cuts and asset sales, Parliament Speaker Filippos Petsalnikos
said in remarks carried live on state-run Vouli TV. They vote
tomorrow on an implementation law. The measures are needed for
the nation to get a fifth installment from last year’s 110
billion-euro rescue and a second aid package.  To contact the reporters on this story:
