Mozambique has approved a 1.5
billion Meticais programme to finance the production of seeds
that will lead to improved yields, state run news agency Agencia
de Informacao de Mocambique reported, citing Agriculture
Minister Jose Pacheco.  The approval of the funding, which will partly come from
the state budget, comes after the government approved a
development plan for the agricultural sector in May this year,
the Maputo-based news agency said.  Mozambique produces 6,000 tons of seeds, of which 50
percent is maize seed, 32 percent rice seeds while the
rest is diverse seeds, according to AIM.  To contact the reporter on this story:
