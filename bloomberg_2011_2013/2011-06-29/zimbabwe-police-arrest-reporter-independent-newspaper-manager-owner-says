Zimbabwean police arrested two
journalists and a newspaper manager, said Trevor Ncube, owner of
 Zimbabwe ’s Alpha Media Holdings Ltd.  Nevanji Madanhire, editor of the  Zimbabwe Standard ,
Patience Nyangove, a reporter with the same newspaper and the
company’s human resources manager, were taken by police who
refused to say what charges would be laid, Ncube said in an e-
mailed statement today. Charges may relate to a Standard story
about the arrest last week of Jameson Timba, a minister of state
and a member of the Movement for Democratic Change, Ncube said.  Calls to Zimbabwe’s chief police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena
weren’t immediately answered when Bloomberg News sought comment.  Madanhire was previously arrested on Nov. 30 last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
