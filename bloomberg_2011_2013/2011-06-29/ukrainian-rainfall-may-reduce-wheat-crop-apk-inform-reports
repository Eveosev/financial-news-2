Ukraine’s wheat harvest may be 5
percent to 10 percent smaller than expected because of local
rains, APK-Inform reported.  Wet weather caused crop losses for winter and spring wheat,
the news service said today, citing Tetiana Adamenko, head of
the national weather center’s agricultural department. Wheat
fields suffered in the Kirovohrad, Vinnytsya, Kiev, Cherkasy,
Odessa and Mykolayiv regions, it said.  Corn and sunflowers will benefit from the wet weather, APK-
Inform said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
