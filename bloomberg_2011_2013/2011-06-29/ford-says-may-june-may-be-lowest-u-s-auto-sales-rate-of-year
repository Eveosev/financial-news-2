Ford Motor Co. (F) , the second-largest
U.S. automaker, said U.S. industrywide auto sales will rise in
the second half on greater availability of models and increased
demand after reaching a low point in May and June.  June’s seasonally adjusted annual rate will match or be
“slightly better,” than May’s 11.8 million rate,  George Pipas ,
Ford’s sales analyst, told reporters today in Dearborn,
 Michigan , where the company is based. Ford’s June sales rose
from a year earlier, he said, without providing specific
figures.  Industrywide sales have been hurt by “the lack of
availability of some popular products in May, June and probably
July” because of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in  Japan ,
Pipas said. “When they come back on line, we’ll do as well as
we did in the first four months of the year, plus we’ll have
pent-up demand from people who have been deferring purchases.”  Ford’s U.S. sales fell 2.6 percent in May, as rising
gasoline prices and smaller discounts pushed industrywide sales
lower by 3.7 percent. Ford’s U.S. market share slid to 16.6
percent this year through May from 16.9 percent a year earlier,
according to researcher Autodata Corp. of  Woodcliff Lake ,  New
Jersey .  The “underlying demand” is for a 13 million sales rate,
Pipas said. “The economy is expanding, income is expanding, the
population is growing and cars are getting older.”  Ford’s Forecast  Next year, U.S. auto sales should climb higher than Ford’s
2011 forecast, which is for 13 million to 13.5 million cars and
trucks, Pipas said. That forecast includes 200,000 medium- and
heavy-duty trucks.  Light-vehicle sales climbed to 11.6 million in 2010 from a
27-year low of 10.4 million in 2009. Deliveries still were 31
percent fewer than the 16.8 million annual average from 2000 to
2007, according to Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey-based Autodata.  The automaker is not concerned the  U.S. economy  will fall
back into a recession, Pipas said.  “The likelihood of a double dip is not even on our radar
screen,” Pipas said. “There’s too much uncertainty to say with
clarity when sales in the U.S. will return to the levels we saw
earlier” in the century.  Ford rose 9 cents to $13.42 at 4 p.m. in composite trading
on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen 20
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
