Actelion Ltd. (ATLN) ,  Switzerland ’s biggest
biotechnology company, took a $577 million provision to cover
damages that a U.S. jury awarded to Asahi Kasei Pharma Corp. in
a dispute over development of a lung medicine.  Actelion will record the provision in its second-quarter
financial statements after a U.S. trial court didn’t enter a
judgment yesterday, the Allschwil-based company said today in a
statement. Actelion is “very likely” to report an operating
loss for the year under U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles as long as the amount stands, it said.  A California jury awarded Tokyo-based Asahi Kasei $577
million on May 3. The Japanese drugmaker earlier claimed
Actelion had acquired CoTherix Inc. to halt work on the fasudil
lung drug and protect profit margins for its own competing
product, Tracleer. Before the acquisition, CoTherix was
developing fasudil with Asahi Kasei.  “The company and its external advisers believe that the
verdict is neither supported by the facts nor is it correct as a
matter of law,” Actelion said today. “The company is therefore
confident that there are significant grounds for a successful
appeal, which will be filed in due course.”  The provision won’t be included in the Swiss drugmaker’s
non-GAAP operating profit for 2011 and doesn’t affect its
forecast for the year, Actelion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
