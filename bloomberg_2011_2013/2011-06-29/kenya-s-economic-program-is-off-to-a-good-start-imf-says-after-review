The International Monetary Fund said
 Kenya ’s economic reform program is “off to a good start,” and
noted that inflation pressures have emerged.  “Strong growth continues in 2011, with the exception of
the agricultural sector, expected to decelerate significantly as
a result of weather disturbances in the first months of the
year,” the IMF said in a statement. “Inflationary pressures
have emerged as a result of the global increase in food and fuel
prices, insufficient rains, and growing domestic demand.”  The fund completed the first review under a three-year
arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility for Kenya. The
completion of the review enables the disbursement of about $65
million, the IMF said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
