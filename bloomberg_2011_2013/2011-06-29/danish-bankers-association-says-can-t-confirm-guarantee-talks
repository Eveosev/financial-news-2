The Danish Bankers Association
declined to confirm a media report that it had proposed a state
guarantee on foreign bank loans and that the government was
considering the option.  The Copenhagen-based group can’t comment on discussions
with the government, press spokesman Mikael Winkler said in a
text reply to questions.  Reuters Finans earlier today reported that  Denmark ’s
government may be mulling a state guarantee for foreign loans
taken up by the country’s banks, after the bankers association
raised the option.  “At the moment, there is a range of proposals from the
bankers association and a number of bank directors that I’m
discussing,” Economy Minister Brian Mikkelsen said today,
according to Reuters. “ I don’t wish to reveal which proposals
we’re working on. But I can say that the government won’t be
providing more state capital. There’s no question of that.”  Calls to the mobile phone of Mikkelsen’s spokesman Erik
Ljunggren went unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
