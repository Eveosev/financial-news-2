Greece ’s planned sale of state
assets, which is intended to raise 50 billion euros ($72
billion) for the country by 2015, may not bring in more than a
quarter of that amount, unless more prime land and cultural
heritage are added to the sales list, the Financial Times
reported, citing a report by Privatisation Barometer, a Milan-
based institute backed by Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei and KPMG.  Only 13 billion euros of assets are ready for sale, leaving
a shortfall of 37 billion euros, the study said, according to
the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
