BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc. (BJ)  received
commitments for $2.58 billion in senior secured debt to back its
buyout by private-equity firms  Leonard Green  & Partners LLP and
 CVC Capital Partners .  The third-largest U.S. warehouse-club chain has received
financing for a $1.25 billion first-lien  term loan , a $900
million, asset-based loan and a $425 million second-lien term
loan, according to a regulatory filing today.  BJ’s, based in Westborough, Massachusetts, said today it
agreed to be purchased by Leonard Green and CVC Capital in an
all-cash deal valued at $2.8 billion.  The private-equity firms plan to invest $320 million of
equity to help finance the buyout, the company said in the
regulatory filing.  The debt funding will be supplied by Deutsche Bank AG,
Citigroup Inc. Barclays Bank Plc, Jefferies Group Inc., General
Electric Capital Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co.  The buyout is expected to close in the fourth quarter,
pending regulatory approval.  Borrowings under an asset-based revolver are tied to a

repaid first in a bankruptcy or liquidation, second-lien debt is
repaid next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
