Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  climbed the most in
more than a month in Mumbai on reports that India’s top court
asked the government of West Bengal state to not return land
acquired by the company to farmers.  The shares rose 1.85 percent to 1,002.95 rupees at 12.11
p.m. local time, after climbing as much as 2.9 percent. The
benchmark Sensitive Index advanced 0.7 percent.  “It’s a positive development,” said Kunal Dalal, an
analyst with Mumbai-based KR Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt.
“Vendors whose money is tied up will be very happy. Tata can
derive some relief out of this ruling.”  The  Press Trust of India  reported the ruling today, without
saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
