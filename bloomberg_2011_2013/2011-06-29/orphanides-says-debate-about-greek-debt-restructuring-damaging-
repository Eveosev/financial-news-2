European Central Bank Governing
Council member Athanasios Orphanides said public debate about a
possible restructuring of Greek debt has damaged the euro-area
economy.  “Public discussion of potential debt restructuring by
euro-area sovereigns has been extremely damaging to the euro-
area economy as a whole,” Orphanides said today in Nicosia,
according to speech notes provided by the Central Bank of
Cyprus, which he heads. He called for more clarity on a crisis
resolution framework for the euro area, saying while the main
elements of the proposed European Stability Mechanism have been
agreed, “crucial details are lacking.”  “Because financial markets are forward looking, the
uncertainty created by lack of clarity regarding the handling of
future potential crises has an adverse impact on the euro area
today,” Orphanides said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
