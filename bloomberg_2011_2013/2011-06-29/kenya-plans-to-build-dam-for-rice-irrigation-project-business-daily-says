Kenya plans to build a 13.6 billion-
shilling ($151 million) dam with assistance from Japan and the
 World Bank  to irrigate rice fields at Mwea in the central
region, Business Daily reported.  Japan will provide 12 billion shilling for the project,
while the World Bank will contribute 650 million shillings and
the government 1 billion shillings, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said, citing Hosea Wendot, manager of the Mwea Irrigation
Scheme.  The so-called Thiba Dam will help boost rice production in
the area to 100,000 metric tons from 40,000 tons, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
