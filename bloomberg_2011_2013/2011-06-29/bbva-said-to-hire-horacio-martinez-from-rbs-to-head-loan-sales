Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) 
hired Horacio Martinez from  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  to
head global loan sales as Spain’s second-largest expands its
investment banking operations, according to two people with
direct knowledge of the matter.  Martinez will report to Janin Campos, who also joined
BBVA from RBS earlier this year as global head of loan
syndication, said the people, who declined to be identified
before a public announcement. Martinez will start next month,
said the people. Martinez previously ran loan sales for Southern
Europe at RBS, which was taken over by the U.K. government in
2008 after being hobbled by losses in the credit crisis.  BBVA is hiring about 300 bankers and traders this year,
expanding its workforce of 4,400, Jose Barreiro, head of the
lender’s wholesale banking and asset management division, said
in a June 9 interview.  A Madrid-based spokesman at BBVA who didn’t want to be
identified declined to comment. Rebecca Nelson, a London-based
spokeswoman at RBS, wasn’t immediately available to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
