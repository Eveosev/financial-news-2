Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNEC) , the Calgary-
based  oil company  that operates fields in  South America ,
advanced from an 11-month low after saying it discovered a new
pool at its main production field in Colombia.  Canacol rose 3.1 percent to 1,985 pesos in Bogota at 4 p.m.
 New York  time. Shares fell to 1,925 pesos yesterday, the lowest
since July.  The company said the C7 sandstone reservoir in the Rancho
Hermoso 4 well flowed at an average rate of 1,785 barrels per
day after a week of production testing.  “No reserves are currently attributed to the C7 reservoir,
and based upon the positive test results, the corporation is
formulating a plan to develop this new productive reservoir on a
field-wide basis,” Canacol said in a statement on its website.  The company plans to develop four wells at the Hermoso
field between July and year-end. Its total average net
production was 11,799 barrels a day for May 2011, mostly from
the Hermoso field, the statement said.  “The update is positive,” analysts Maria Adelaida Velasquez and Juan David Pineros at Interbolsa SA,  Colombia ’s
biggest brokerage, wrote in an e-mailed report “This will
contribute to an increase in its future reserves.”  Canacol had fallen for three days in a row as investors
waited for an update on exploration at the Hermoso field,
Velasquez said in a phone interview yesterday.  Oil rose, in the biggest two-day rally in seven weeks in
New York, after the U.S. government said supplies dropped almost
three times as much as expected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
