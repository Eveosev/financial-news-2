Indian Oil Corp. and state-run rival
Hindustan Petroleum Corp. led refiners in boosting the country’s
crude processing in May for the sixth straight month.  Refiners turned 14.4 million metric tons of crude into
fuels, 4.5 percent higher than a year earlier, the oil ministry
said in a statement in  New Delhi  today.  Processing by state-owned Indian Oil, the nation’s largest
refiner, rose 7.8 percent to 4.8 million tons after its plant at
Koyali in Gujarat state increased production by 29 percent.
Hindustan Petroleum, based in Mumbai, raised output 16 percent
to 1.3 tons.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , operator of the world’s biggest
refining complex, processed 2.9 million tons, a drop of 5.7
percent. Smaller rival  Essar Oil Ltd. (ESOIL)  cut output 1.2 percent.
Reliance didn’t provide data for its newer, 29 million ton-a-
year refinery, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
