U.S. stocks pared gains after the
Greek parliament approved austerity measures needed to win
European bailout funds, as investors bet the vote failed to
justify this week’s rally.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent to
1,298.98 at 10:04 a.m. in  New York . September futures on the
measure had risen as much as 0.7 percent earlier. The index
rallied 2.2 percent the first two days of the week. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  fell 4.73 points, or less than 0.1
percent, to 12,183.96.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
