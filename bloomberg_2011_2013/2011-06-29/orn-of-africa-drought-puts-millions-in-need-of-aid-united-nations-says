At least 9 million people in the
Horn of  Africa  are in need of humanitarian assistance because of
drought and conflict in the region, the World Food Program said.  The  United Nations ’ food agency has been forced to scale
back aid in two of the affected countries, Somalia and Ethiopia,
due to a lack of funds, at a time when rations should be
increased, Josette Sheeran, WFP’s executive director, said in an
e-mailed statement today. Other countries hit by the drought
include Djibouti, Kenya and  Uganda .  The WFP aims to provide food assistance to about 6 million
of the most vulnerable people in the region, where the drought
poses as big a threat as the earthquake in Haiti that killed
300,000 people last year, she said. The crisis comes as more
than 10,000 Somali refugees flee conflict to camps in
neighboring  Kenya  each week, she said.  Somalia hasn’t had a functioning central administration
since the ouster of Mohamed Siad Barre 20 years ago. The south
and center of the country is under siege by an al-Qaeda-linked
Islamic militia, known as al-Shabaab, while the government has
control over parts of Mogadishu, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
