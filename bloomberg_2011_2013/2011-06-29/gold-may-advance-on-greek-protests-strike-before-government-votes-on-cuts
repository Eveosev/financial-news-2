Gold increased for a second day as
concern about protests and strikes in  Greece  before the
government’s vote on budget cuts boosted demand for the metal as
an alternative investment.  Gold for August delivery gained as much as 0.4 percent to
$1,506.40 an ounce and was at $1,505.90 at 2:21 p.m. in
Singapore. The price has lost 2 percent this month. The
immediate-delivery contract was 0.3 percent higher at $1,505.28
an ounce.  “One of the key things we might get is some form of  risk
premium  built into the market if social unrest starts to pick
up,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity
Broking Services Pty. in Sydney. “If they see some social
unrest, they can see instability again. Those sorts of things
suggest a flight back to some sort of security.”  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s 78 billion euro
($112 billion) plan to cut spending and sell assets is set for a
vote in parliament today. Papandreou won a confidence vote in
parliament last week by a vote of 155-143.  Greece’s parliament remains the focus of protests that
yesterday clogged Athens’ city center with more than 20,000
people in the first half of a 48-hour general strike. Thirty
seven police were injured and clouds of tear gas filled the air
as hooded youths wielding clubs smashed windows at a McDonald’s
Corp. restaurant and burned vehicles.  “There are challenges ahead and no 100% guarantee that
parliament will enforce austerity measures right away,”  Andrey
Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in  London , wrote in a
report yesterday. “We still believe that, despite the latest
pullback, escalating  risk aversion  could still push bullion back
to May highs, with resistance around $1,568 and $1,570, should
the situation in the Eurozone worsen.”  Tear Gas  At 10:30 p.m. last night, police estimated the crowd
outside Parliament at 8,000. Officers used more tear gas to
fight off protesters rushing fences around the legislature.  “We anticipate that everything will be alright, that we’ll
get the green light for the austerity measures,” Barratt said.  Failure to pass the two bills may lead to the euro area’s
first sovereign default as Greece needs to cover 6.6 billion
euros of maturing bonds in August. Greek government officials
have said they may also not have cash to pay wages and pensions
by mid-July.  Germany’s biggest banks and insurers will meet with the
 Finance Ministry  in Berlin today as they seek to reach an
agreement on their contribution to a Greek aid package.  German and French lenders are the biggest European holders
of Greek debt and their participation in the plan is key to the
European Union goal of getting banks to roll over at least 30
billion euros of bonds.  Silver for September delivery climbed 1.5 percent to $34.17
an ounce, while the metal for immediate delivery gained 0.6
percent to $34.1613 an ounce. Spot palladium was 0.3 percent
higher at $743.50 an ounce, and cash platinum increased 1
percent to $1,707.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
