It is difficult to see how the
current economic slump will end, Nobel-prize winning economist
 Paul Krugman  said.  “I’ve been trying very hard to think of how this ends, and
it is hard to see,” Krugman said today at an Economic Club of
 Canada  breakfast in Toronto. “It does look as if this is going
to be a prolonged slump in the  United States ; in Western Europe
as a whole.”  Krugman , a columnist for the New York Times who has written
books on the financial crisis, said the sovereign debt troubles
faced by  Greece  have warped the debate about economic policies.
“A little inflation would actually be helpful right now,” he
said.  Financial markets don’t appear to have a fear of future
inflationary pressures and the  U.S. economy  won’t slip into
another recession, Krugman said.  Krugman added the U.S. “would be in great shape” if it
could keep its health-care costs, which have been rising, in
line with Canada’s. Integrated systems and socialized medicine
would be the cheapest way to accomplish this, he said.  “If the United States could trade for Canadian health-care
costs, our budget problems would be solved for the next 15 or 20
years,” he said.  Krugman also said that the Canadian economy looks
remarkably like the U.S. economy in terms of its liabilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
