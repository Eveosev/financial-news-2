Oil options volatility declined as
oil rose in the biggest two-day rally in seven weeks in  New York 
after the U.S. government reported that supplies dropped almost
three times as much as expected.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of option prices, was 30.1 percent as of 3 p.m. in New
York, down from 30.2 percent yesterday.  Crude for August delivery rose $1.88, or 2 percent, to
settle at $94.77 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices advanced 4.6 percent in the past two sessions, the
biggest two-day increase since May 10. Futures have gained 25
percent in the past year and have fallen 11 percent this
quarter.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
August $80 puts, with 2,881 lots changing hands as of 3:12 p.m.
They slipped 2 cents to 9 cents a barrel. August $85 puts, the
next-most active option, fell 13 cents to 27 cents a barrel with
2,236 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  August $80 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 10,009 lots changing hands. They lost 14 cents
to 11 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, August $100
calls, increased 16 cents to 35 cents a barrel on volume of
4,053 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
43,588 contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 38,796 and
