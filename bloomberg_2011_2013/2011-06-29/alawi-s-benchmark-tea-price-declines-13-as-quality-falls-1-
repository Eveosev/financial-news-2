The benchmark price of tea in
Malawi,  Africa ’s largest producer of the crop after Kenya, fell
13 percent yesterday as the quality declined, according to Tea
Brokers Central Africa, which manages the nation’s tea sales.  The top grade of tea, known as pekoe fannings, fetched
$2.52 a kilogram (2.2 pounds) at a sale in the commercial
capital, Blantyre, down from $2.91 a week earlier, Tea Brokers
said in an e-mailed report today.  Farmers raised $125,952 selling 76,160 kilograms of various
grades of the leaf, compared with $207,876 from 138,840
kilograms a week earlier, it said.  Tea is Malawi’s second-largest foreign exchange earner,
after tobacco, generating 8 percent of total export earnings.
The U.K. is typically the largest buyer of tea from  Malawi .  To contact the reporter on this story:
