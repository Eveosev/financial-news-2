Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  recommends purchasing
the dollar and selling  Japan ’s yen as the Asian nation’s
declining exports will erode its currency’s status as a haven.  The bank recommends buying the dollar at 81.01 yen and
targeting an appreciation to 84 yen. The trade should be
scrapped if the dollar depreciates to 79.5 yen, Stockholm-based
strategists Jonas Thulin, Daniel Nilsmo and Nils Rosendahl wrote
in a research note today.  “With Japan currently running a trade deficit, we question
for how long its safe-haven status will persist, as the country
previously has been able to borrow cheaply despite massive
government debt,” the note said. “Japan might not be able to
access credit markets as cheaply as it previously has, which
should weigh on the yen.”  The dollar weakened 0.4 percent to 80.83 yen as of 2:09
p.m. in  London .  Japan’s exports fell more than economists estimated in May,
adding to signs the world’s third-largest economy may struggle
to recover from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  Exports decreased 10.3 percent last month from a year
earlier, the  Finance Ministry  said June 20, while economists had
projected an 8.4 percent decline. It was the second-biggest
trade deficit since comparable data were made available in 1979.  To contact the reporter on this story:
