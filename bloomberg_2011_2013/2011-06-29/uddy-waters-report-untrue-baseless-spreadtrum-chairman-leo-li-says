Spreadtrum Communications Inc. (SPRD) , the
Chinese chip designer questioned by short-seller Muddy Waters
LLC over its accounting, said a report suggesting it misstated
financial results is “untrue” and “baseless.”  “Our performance is very solid,” Leo Li, the chief
executive officer, chairman and president of the Shanghai-based
company, said in an interview in his office today. “The
allegations, none of them, are true.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
