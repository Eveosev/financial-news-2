The European Commission approved a
staff recommendation to unlock a 300 million-euro ($431.5
million) loan payment to help finance  Latvia â€™s budget deficit
after the government submitted plans to restructure a state-
owned bank, the  Baltic News Service  reported.  The money comes from about 650 million euros the EU and
 International Monetary Fund  set aside for bank stabilization
measures. Latvia turned to a group led by the EU and IMF for a
7.5 billion-euro loan program in 2008 after its second-biggest
bank needed a state rescue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
