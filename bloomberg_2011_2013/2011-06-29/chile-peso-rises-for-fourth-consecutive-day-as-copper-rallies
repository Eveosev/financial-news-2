Chile ’s peso strengthened for a
fifth straight day as rising copper prices bolstered trade
prospects in the metal’s top-producing nation, and speculation
that  Greece  will avoid a default on its debt increased demand
for riskier emerging-market assets.  The peso advanced 0.5 percent to 467.22 per  U.S. dollar  at
2 p.m. New York time, from 469.73 yesterday. The currency
decreased 0.5 percent in June.  “As copper rises, the peso will continue pushing forward,
especially if other drivers are promising,” Mauricio Olivares,
a senior currency trader at Scotiabank Sud Americano in
Santiago, said in a telephone interview. “The imminent bailout
in Greece has also helped the peso’s strong showing.”  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, gained
as much as 1.5 percent today in  New York , reaching the highest
price since April 28.  Greek lawmakers backed a bill to authorize implementation
of the government’s 78 billion-euro ($113 billion) package of
budget cuts and state asset sales.  Approval of the bill was needed before the cash-strapped
nation can tap a fifth loan payment from last year’s 110
billion-euro rescue by the European Union and  International
Monetary Fund .  Chile’s central bank paid an average of 468.56 pesos per
U.S. dollar for $50 million as part of a $12 billion effort to
limit the peso’s gains, according to data posted on the bank’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
