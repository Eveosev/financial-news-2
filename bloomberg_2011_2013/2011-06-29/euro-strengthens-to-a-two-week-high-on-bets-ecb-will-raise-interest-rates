The euro touched the highest in
almost three weeks against the dollar on prospects the  European
Central Bank  will increase interest rates next week to curb
inflation and as European ministers are set to approve the next
aid payment due to  Greece .  Riskier assets advanced against the Swiss franc and the
dollar after German financial firms agreed to roll over Greek
debt holdings. Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won
approval of a second bill to authorize his 78 billion-euro ($113
billion) package of budget cuts and asset sales, a key to
receiving further international financial aid. The Dollar Index
fell even as the  Federal Reserve  ended its second round of
quantitative easing.  “The euro is higher after Greece passed the implementation
bill for austerity measures this morning, providing a bit more
relief,” said Charles St-Arnaud, a foreign-exchange strategist
at Nomura Holdings Inc. in  New York . “Greece seems to have
accepted it needs to tackle its problem and bank rollovers are
leading to better sentiment.”  The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.4502 at 5 p.m. in New York.
It touched $1.4538, the highest level since June 10. The euro
gained 0.2 percent versus the Japanese currency to 116.84 yen.

up 2.4 percent in the quarter that ends today.  German Rollover  German banks have agreed to roll over about 2 billion euros
in the Greek bonds they’re holding that mature through 2014,
German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said today.
Papandreou garnered the support from 155 lawmakers in the 300-
strong chamber, with 136 voting against, Deputy Parliament
Speaker Grigoris Niotis said in remarks carried live on state-
run Vouli TV today.  The Swiss franc, a traditional haven from financial
turmoil, fell against all 16 of its major peers. It depreciated
1.2 percent against the euro to 1.21876 and was weakened 0.7
percent to 84.04 centimes per dollar, from 83.42.  ECB President Trichet today repeated that policy makers are
in a state of “strong vigilance” ahead of the July 7 meeting,
a phrase he has used before tightening monetary policy in the
past.  ECB Forecast  Investors anticipate the ECB will add 70 additional basis
points to its benchmark interest rate in the next 12 months,
according to a Credit Suisse Group AG index based on swaps. That
compares with 46 basis points yesterday.  The yen pared gains the dollar after the Institute for
Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said today its business barometer
unexpectedly rose to 61.1 in June from 56.6 a month earlier.
Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.  “Chicago PMI massive surprise top side, new orders sharply
up inventories down,” said  Sebastien Galy , a senior foreign-
exchange strategist at Societe Generale SA in  London . “That
would confirm the manufacturing shock thesis. It’s risk on, U.S.
dollar down and dollar-yen tempted to drift higher with U.S.
Treasury yields.”  The dollar was 0.3 percent weaker against the yen at 80.56
after falling as much as 0.6 percent and gaining as much as 0.1
percent.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against currencies from six major U.S. trading
partners, dropped 0.4 percent to 74.691, after touching the
lowest since June 14.  The Fed bought $4.9 billion of notes due from June 2017 to
June 2018, marking completion of the central bank’s effort to

fourth day of gains. U.S. 10-year yields rose five basis points
or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.16 percent.  Canada ’s dollar advanced 0.6 percent against the dollar to
96.34 cents per  U.S. dollar , from 96.95. Crude oil, the nation’s
largest export gained 0.4 percent to $95.12 a barrel in the
third day of gains.  South Korea’s won was the best performer against the U.S.
currency as factory output beat economists estimates today..  The won climbed as much as 0.9 percent to 1,067.65 per U.S.
dollar, the highest in almost two months, gaining 2.7 percent
for the quarter, the best performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-
active currencies.  Sterling weakened versus 13 of its 16 major peers as U.K.
consumer confidence fell more than forecast and mortgage demand
is predicted to fall in the third quarter. The euro strengthened
to a 15-month high against the pound amid bets the  Bank of
England  will be restrained in increasing  interest rates  compared
with the ECB.  The pound weakened for a fourth day against the euro,

since March 16, 2010. It was little changed versus the dollar at
$1.6053, touching less than $1.60 for the sixth successive day.  The sputtering economy has investors betting the central
bank will raise borrowing costs May 2012, according to forward
contracts on the sterling overnight interbank average, data from
Tullett Prebon Plc show. As recently as February, traders were
betting on a rate increase in May of this year, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
