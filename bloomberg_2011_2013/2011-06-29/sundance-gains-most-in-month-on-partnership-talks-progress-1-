Sundance Resources Ltd. climbed the
most in almost a month in Sydney trading after saying it made
progress in talks to seek a strategic partner for its $4.7
billion Mbalam  iron ore  project in West Africa.  The shares rose 6.4 percent to 33.5 Australian cents at
10:31 a.m. local time, set for their biggest advance since May
30, and were trading at 32 cents at 11:23 a.m.  Perth-based Sundance wants to develop iron ore deposits at
the border of the Republic of Cameroon and the Republic of
Congo, it said in a stock exchange filing today. The mine may
produce 35 million metric tons of iron ore a year and Sundance
needs to build a 510-kilometer (317 mile) rail line to send the
ore to the Cameroon coast. It also needs to construct a deep
water port that can handle carriers with a capacity of 300,000
tons.  “Potential partners and a number of Chinese banking
institutions recently visited Sundance’s operations"  to
complete due diligence, Sundance said. The company aims to start
work on the construction of the rail and port infrastructure by
the end of this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
