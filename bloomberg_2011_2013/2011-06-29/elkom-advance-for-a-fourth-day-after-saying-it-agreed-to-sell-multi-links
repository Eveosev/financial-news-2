Telkom South Africa Ltd., the
continent’s biggest fixed-line phone operator, climbed for a
fourth day after saying it reached an agreement where an
affiliate of Helios Towers Nigeria Ltd. will buy its unit in the
West African nation.  The stock rallied 74 cents, or 2.1 percent, to 36.19 rand
by 9:05 a.m. in Johannesburg.  The Helios unit will acquire full ownership and control of
Telkom’s Multi-Links, it said in a statement after the market
closed yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
