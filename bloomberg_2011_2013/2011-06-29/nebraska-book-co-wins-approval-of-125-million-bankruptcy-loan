Nebraska  Book Co., an operator of a
nationwide chain of college bookstores, won court approval to
borrow as much as $125 million to help fund operations while in
bankruptcy.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Peter Walsh gave the company
permission to borrow the funds on an interim basis, according to
court papers filed yesterday in  Delaware . A  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
unit is acting as the agent for lenders.  Nebraska Book will seek court approval to borrow an
additional $75 million from the total $200 million financing
package at a hearing set for July 21, court documents show.  The company, based in Lincoln, Nebraska, listed about
$657.2 million in assets and about $564 million in debt as of
Feb. 14, including the debt and assets of affiliates, in Chapter
11 documents filed this week in Wilmington.  Nebraska Book currently has about 280 stores on and off
campus. It also has one of the largest wholesale distribution
networks of used textbooks, supplying college bookstores with
more than 105,000 different book titles and selling more than
6.3 million books a year.  The funds allow them to acquire the textbooks and other
supplies they need for the fall back-to-school rush, which were
historically obtained on credit from vendors, the company said
in court papers.  The loan was necessary to “seamlessly transition their
business into Chapter 11 at this critical stage in their
business cycle and ultimately reorganize in a successful and
expedient manner.”  Noteholder Support  The company reached an agreement on a restructuring with
the support of more than 95 percent of the holders of its 8.625
percent senior subordinated notes and more than 75 percent of
its 11 percent discount noteholders. The bookseller said in a
June 27 statement it will restructure about $450 million in
loans and bonds of its parent, NBC Acquisition Corp., and
affiliates.  Nebraska Book has proposed a restructuring that would turn
control of the company over to noteholders, court papers show.
Under the proposal, $175 million in 8.625 million senior
subordinated notes would be converted into $30.6 million in
secured notes, $120 million in unsecured notes and 78 percent of
the new equity. Holders of the $77 million in 11 percent
discount notes would receive the remaining 22 percent of the
stock.  Secured lenders, owed about $26.3 million, and secured
noteholders, owed about $200 million, would be paid in full with
cash.  The case is In re Nebraska Book Co. Inc., 11-12005,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
