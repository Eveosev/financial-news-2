OAO Cherkizovo Group,  Russia ’s
second-largest poultry producer, began construction yesterday of
a new plant estimated to cost 19.5 billion rubles ($696
million).  The plant will start operating in 2013 and will reach its
full capacity by the end of 2015, the Moscow-based company said
today in a statement. OAO Gazprombank provided a 10-year loan
that covers 80 percent of the project’s cost, it said. The
factory is in the town of Yelets in the Lipetsk region.  The facility will produce more than 500,000 metric tons of
poultry a year by live weight, Cherkizovo said. That equates to
almost 13 percent of Russian poultry output last year, according
to the Federal State Statistics Service. Annual production of
poultry meat is planned to exceed 200,000 tons, the statement
shows.  The plant includes a hatchery, a slaughter complex, a
waste-utilization facility and a feed-producing unit, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
