Brazil  will seek support from the
Mercosur trade bloc for a plan allowing temporary increases in
import tariffs for certain goods from outside the region, a
Brazilian official said.  The proposal would allow all members of Mercosur, which
includes  Argentina , Brazil,  Paraguay  and Uruguay, to protect
local manufacturers from foreign competition, Bruno Bath, who
heads the Mercosur Department at Brazil’s Foreign Affairs office,
told reporters today in Asuncion, where the trade bloc is having
its annual summit.  Under the proposal, each country could present a list of
products on which they would like to charge higher import
tariffs, with final approval from the other members required,
Bath said.  “There are products that are heavily subsidized by certain
governments and which are highly competitive,” Bath said.
“This distorts the product’s price, which becomes so cheap that
it displaces local production.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
