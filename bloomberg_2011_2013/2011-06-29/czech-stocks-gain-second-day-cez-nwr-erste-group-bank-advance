The  Czech Republic ’s benchmark stock
index rallied the most in almost seven months, led by lenders,
as optimism  Greece  will approve budget cuts aimed at preventing
a default fueled investor demand for riskier assets.  The PX gauge increased 1.9 percent to 1,216.3 at the close
of trading in  Prague  today, the biggest rally since Dec. 1.
Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech
unit of Societe Generale SA, jumped more than 3 percent each.  Stocks and commodities advanced worldwide and the euro
gained to the dollar on speculation Greek Prime Minister  George
Papandreou  would have enough votes in parliament to pass a 78
billion-euro ($112 billion) austerity package. The plan, needed
to secure more rescue funds, passed by 155 votes to 138 today.  “After days of concern about the Greek austerity package
and the whole country, optimism is getting the upper hand in the
markets,” Ondrej Moravansky, an analyst at Cyrrus brokerage in
Brno, Czech Republic, wrote in a report before the Greek vote.
“The lawmakers’ approval is now the only thinkable option.”  Czech coal company New World Resources Plc rose 1.7 percent
to 240.1 koruna as European derivatives for the commodity
gained.  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the country’s largest power utility, added 1.3
percent to 864.9 koruna, its biggest one-day gain since June 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
