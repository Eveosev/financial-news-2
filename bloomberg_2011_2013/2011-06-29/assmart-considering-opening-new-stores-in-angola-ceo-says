Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) , the South
African retailer controlled by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , is
considering opening stores in Angola, said Chief Executive
Officer Grant Pattison.  “We are considering starting with a Game store in Luanda,
but a decision will be made in the next few months,” Pattison
told reporters on a conference call today. Massmart’s Game
stores sell general merchandise and non-perishable goods. Luanda
is the capital of Angola,  Africa ’s second-largest oil producer.  Angola would be the first store expansion into a new market
for Johannesburg-based Massmart since Wal-Mart announced on June
20 that it had acquired a 51 percent controlling interest.  The company likes growing cities where new properties are
being developed and infrastructure is being rolled out, said
Pattison. “We take that as an indicator that the market is
ready for us,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
