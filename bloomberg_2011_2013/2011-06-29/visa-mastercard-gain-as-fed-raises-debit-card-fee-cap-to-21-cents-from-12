Visa Inc. (V)  and  MasterCard Inc. (MA) , the
world’s biggest consumer-payment networks, both surged more than
9 percent after the  Federal Reserve  moved to cap debit-card
transaction fees at 21 cents.  Visa advanced 9.1 percent, to $82.15 at 3:12 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. MasterCard rose 9.2
percent, to $303.92  The cap on swipe fees, also called interchange, was
mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. San Francisco-based Visa and
MasterCard, based in Purchase, New York, set interchange fees
that are paid by merchants and pass the money to card issuers
including  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)   The cap, which will reduce the fees merchants pay to accept
debit cards, replaces a formula that averages 1.14 percent of
the purchase price.  Visa had gained 7 percent this year through yesterday after
falling 20 percent in 2010, while MasterCard had gained 24
percent this year after last year’s 12 percent decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
