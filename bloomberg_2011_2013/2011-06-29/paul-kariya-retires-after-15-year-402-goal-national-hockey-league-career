Paul Kariya retired from the
 National Hockey League  after missing last season because of
post-concussion symptoms, ending a 15-year career.  Kariya, 36, has played his last NHL game, his agent, Don
Baizley, announced today in a statement distributed by the NHL
Playersâ€™ Association. A seven-time All-Star, Kariya had 402
goals and 587 assists.  Kariya was selected by the Anaheim Ducks with the No. 4
pick in the 1993 NHL Draft. He reached the 50-point level 10
times, including the 1996-97 season, when he led the league with
10 game-winning goals. He had 39 points in 46 playoff games.  Kariya won a gold medal with Canada in the 2002 Winter
Olympics, scoring in the final against the U.S. He played for
four teams in his 15-year NHL career -- the Ducks, the Colorado
Avalanche, the  Nashville Predators  and the  St. Louis Blues  --
and was twice awarded the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for
sportsmanship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
