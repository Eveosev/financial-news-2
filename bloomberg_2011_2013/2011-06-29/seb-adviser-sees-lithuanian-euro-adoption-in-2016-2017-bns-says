Lithuania  may adopt the euro in 2016
or 2017 as inflation and debt delay plans to introduce the
currency in 2014, said Gitanas Nauseda, an adviser to SEB AB’s
Lithuanian unit, according to the  Baltic News Service .  "I don’t think that Lithuania will manage to adopt the euro
in 2014," Nauseda said at a British Chamber of Commerce event in
Vilnius today, BNS reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
