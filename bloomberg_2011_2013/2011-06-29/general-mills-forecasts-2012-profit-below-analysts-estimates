General Mills Inc. (GIS)  projected full-
year earnings that trailed analysts’ estimates as the maker of
Cheerios cereal faces “significantly” higher costs for
ingredients and energy.  Profit for fiscal 2012 will rise to $2.60 to $2.62, the
Minneapolis-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
projected $2.68, the average of 19 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Ken Powell said he expects input
cost inflation of as much as 11 percent in fiscal 2012,
according to the statement. The company has been raising prices
on some products to combat rising costs for raw ingredients like
wheat and sugar. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  predicts
that cereal and bakery product prices will rise as much as 4.5
percent in 2011.  Fourth-quarter net income rose to $320.2 million, or 48
cents a share, in the quarter ended May 29, from $211.9 million,
or 31 cents, a year earlier, the company said today in a
statement. Analysts projected 52 cents, the average of 18
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  General Mills fell 4 cents to $37.21 yesterday in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares had gained 4.6
percent this year before today.  Last month, the company acquired French yogurt maker
Yoplait SAS for 810 million euros ($1.15 billion) to build
market share and accelerate growth in emerging economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
