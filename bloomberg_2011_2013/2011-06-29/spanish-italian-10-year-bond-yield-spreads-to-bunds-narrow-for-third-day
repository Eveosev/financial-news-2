The additional yield investors
demand to hold Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds instead of
benchmark German bunds narrowed for a third day.  The difference in yield, or spread, between the Spanish
securities and equivalent-maturity German debt fell three basis
points to 267 basis points as of 7:37 a.m. in  London . The
Italian spread narrowed two basis points to 2.03 percentage
points, as German 10-year bond yields rose.  Greek 10-year bonds opened little changed, leaving the
yield at 16.46 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
