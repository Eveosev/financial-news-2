President  Barack Obama  told gay-
rights activists today that they should recognize the progress
made on their issues during his administration, even though
there is still work to do.  At a White House reception for members of the lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transgender community, Obama listed accomplishments
that included expanded hospital visitation rights for same-sex
couples, an end to the ban on travel to the U.S. by foreign
nationals infected with the virus that causes AIDS and a repeal
of the policy prohibiting openly gay people from serving in the
armed forces.  “I think it’s important for us to note the progress that’s
been made just in the past two and a half years,” Obama said.
“The bottom line is I’ve met my commitments.”  “That doesn’t mean our work is done,” he added. “I will
continue to fight alongside you.”  The president did not mention last week’s legalization of
same-sex marriage in  New York  except to note that the struggle
for gay rights goes on in many places, including “in
legislatures like New York” -- a remark that was met with
applause.  Obama said that gay couples should be allowed to “live and
love as they see fit,” but he has not endorsed same-sex
marriage.  At a news conference last December, Obama, who has backed
civil unions for gay couples, said his views on the issue “are
constantly evolving. I struggle with this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
