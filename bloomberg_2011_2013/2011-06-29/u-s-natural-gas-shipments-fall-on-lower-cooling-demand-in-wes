Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators fell for the first time in four days
on forecasts of lower cooling demand in the West, decreasing the
need for fuel to power air-conditioners.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments fell 8.7 percent to 18.3 million
dekatherms (17.9 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Shipments to power generators in California
dropped 20 percent.  Cooling demand in  San Francisco  will be non-existent and 3
percent of normal in Seattle until at least July 6, said Belton,
Missouri-based forecaster Weather Derivatives. Power plants use
30 percent of U.S. gas supplies, according to the Energy
Department.  Much of the West will have normal temperatures until July
3, and Midwestern temperatures will cool to normal from above-
normal July 4-8, MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland,
said in a note to clients.  The high in  Los Angeles  today may reach 76 degrees
Fahrenheit (24 Celsius), 6 below normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. of State College, Pennsylvania.  Scheduled gas shipments for U.S. residences fell 4.5
percent to 22.9 million dekatherms after a 14 percent drop
yesterday.  Wholesale gas at the SoCal Border hub, where gas is
delivered to the Southern California Gas Co., gained 2.03 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $4.4378 per million British thermal units
yesterday on the  Intercontinental Exchange .  Gas at the Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
gained 9.09 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $4.3411 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
