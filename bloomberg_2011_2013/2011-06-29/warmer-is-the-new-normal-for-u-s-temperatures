The  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration ’s benchmark “normal temperatures” for the U.S.
will increase July 1 by a half-degree Fahrenheit to reflect a
warmer world.  In the continental U.S., every state’s maximum and minimum
temperatures are now warmer, according to a NOAA statement
released today. The U.S. government has been updating its
benchmarks once a decade since 1956, when it first published a
set of normal temperatures covering 1921 to 1950.  Normal temperatures are used to determine planting times
for crops, to predict energy usage and to gives states data for
setting utility rates. The previous normals were based on
climate information from 1971 to 2000, a period slightly cooler
than the 30-year span that includes the past decade.  “The climate of the 2000s is about 1.5 degree Fahrenheit
warmer than the 1970s, so we would expect the updated 30-year
normals to be warmer,” said Thomas R. Karl, director of NOAA’s
 National Climatic Data Center .  The new set of statistics being released July 1 will also
include more detailed snow and rain data and hourly normal
temperatures from 250 weather stations, at the request of the
 energy industry , the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
