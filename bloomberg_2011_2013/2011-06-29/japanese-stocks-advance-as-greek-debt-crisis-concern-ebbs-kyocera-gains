Japanese stocks advanced, pushing
the  Nikkei 225  Stock Average to its highest level in seven weeks,

2.1 percent.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) ,  Japan ’s
second-largest publicly traded bank, climbed 1.2 percent. Mitsui
& Co., the country’s No. 2 trading company, increased 2.1
percent.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co., operator of the crippled

plan for  Greece  to some extent and most investors expect the
country will be able to pass its austerity measures,” said
 Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee the equivalent of $18 billion
as chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.
“That boosted investment in risky assets.”  The Topix index has lost 9.3 percent since March 10, the
day before a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated
Japan’s northeast coast, triggering the worst nuclear accident

Inaba.  Japanese banks gained as Europe inched toward agreement on

money in global debt markets.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group climbed 1.2 percent to
2,437 yen.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-biggest
lender by market value, advanced 2.3 percent to 131 yen.  Germany ’s biggest banks and insurers will meet today with

creditors will contribute to a Greek aid package, two people
with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg.  Voting in Greece  Stocks advanced as Greek lawmakers prepared to vote today
and tomorrow on budget cuts and tax increases that European
officials require for delivering bailout money. Greece needs
loans from Europe and the IMF to cover 6.6 billion euros ($9.5
billion) of maturing bonds in August.  The yen depreciated to 116.67 against the euro, the lowest
level in two weeks, compared with 115.28 at the close of  stock
trading  in Tokyo yesterday. Against the dollar, Japan’s currency
weakened to 81.27 from 80.79. A weaker yen benefits Japanese
exporters by boosting the value of their overseas sales.  Trading houses climbed after crude oil for August delivery

Metal Exchange Index of metal prices rose. Mitsui & Co. advanced
2.1 percent to 1,384 yen.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s largest

while the Kyushu utility jumped 5 percent to 1,389 yen.  Japan’s trade ministry said today in Tokyo that industrial
production increased 5.7 percent in May from April, the biggest
gain since 1953, a sign that the economy is recovering after
county’s strongest earthquake shut factories and caused power
shortages. Manufacturing output was better that the 5.5 percent
increase predicted in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  advanced 1.7 percent to 3,270 yen after
the industrial production report. The carmaker’s U.S. sales
