The  New York Mets  ended an almost
two-year wait for a grand slam and moved above .500 for the
first time since the opening week of the Major League Baseball
season with a 14-3 rout of the  Detroit Tigers .  Jason Bay hit his third career grand slam and first since
2006 in the fourth inning at Comerica Park, Detroit, last night
to record the first four-run homer for the Mets since Angel Pagan on Aug. 1, 2009. Carlos Beltran then tallied his ninth
career slam and first since 2008 in the next inning. The Mets’
grand slam drought was the longest in the league.  “Sometimes in this game there are things that take a while
to happen,” Beltran told reporters. “Today, we were able to hit
two. No explanation for it.”  The Mets had 280 at-bats with the bases loaded in 299 games
since Pagan’s grand slam. It was the longest streak without a
four-run homer since the  Florida Marlins  went 363 games without
a grand slam from 2002 to 2004.  The victory took the Mets to 40-39, the first time they
have been above .500 since April 6, when they were 3-2.  Opponents recorded 18 grand slams against  New York  during
the drought, according to Stats LLC.  Both scores last night came off reliever Daniel Schlereth.
The last club to hit grand slams in consecutive innings was the
Washington Nationals on July, 27, 2009, according to Stats.  The  Milwaukee Brewers  now assume the mantle of longest
streak without a grand slam, having last scored one on June 14,
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
