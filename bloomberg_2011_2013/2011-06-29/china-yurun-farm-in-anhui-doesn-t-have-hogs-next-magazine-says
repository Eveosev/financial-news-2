(Corrects ownership of farm in headline and first and
second paragraphs.)  Billy Chan and Michelle Yun  China Yurun Food Group Ltd. (1068) ’s
Chairman Zhu Yicai owns a hog farm in Anhui province that
doesn’t have any stock, Next Magazine reported.  A farm in Xiao county, a four-hour drive from Anhui’s
capital of Hefei, didn’t have any pigs, the Hong Kong
publication reported, citing staff visits. A sign said it
belongs to a company controlled by Zhu and his wife, Next said.  A plant in Taihe county, also in the same province and
owned by Zhu and his wife, appeared to be under construction
even as local government documents showed it as having been
completed in 2008, according to the report.  Winny Yip, a spokeswoman for Hong Kong-listed Yurun,
didn’t answer two calls to her phone.  The pork producer’s shares climbed 6.8 percent, the most
since March 30, to HK$20.70 at the 4 p.m. close of trading in
 Hong Kong .  Yurun had declined 31 percent over the four trading days
through yesterday, wiping about $2 billion off its market value,
amid speculation Muddy Waters LLC may issue a negative report
on the company.  Yurun is  China ’s second-biggest listed meat processor,
trailing Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development Co.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
