France ’s economy, the 17-member euro
region’s second largest after Germany, expanded less than
previously estimated in the first quarter as rising energy
prices squeezed household spending.  Gross domestic product rose 0.9 percent from the fourth
quarter instead of a previously estimated 1 percent, Paris-based
Insee said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the fastest
pace since the second quarter of 2006. In the year, the economy
grew 2.2 percent.  French economic growth accelerated from 0.3 percent in the
fourth quarter as companies boosted output to meet increasing
export demand. With a 30 percent increase in crude  oil prices  in
the year through March reducing disposable incomes,  consumer
spending  rose 1 percent in the first quarter instead a
previously estimated 1.3 percent, Insee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
