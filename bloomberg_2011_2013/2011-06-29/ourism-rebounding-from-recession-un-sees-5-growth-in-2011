International tourism recovered from
the global recession last year, increasing 6.6 percent to a
record 940 million travelers who spent more than $1 trillion,
and is forecast to grow 5 percent in 2011, the  United Nations 
said.  “Developments in North  Africa  and the Middle East, as well
as the devastating earthquake that hit Japan in March, are not
expected to substantially affect this overall forecast,” the
Madrid-based UN World Tourism Organization said in its annual
report today. Tourism has become a “key driver of socio-
economic progress through the creation of jobs and
enterprises,” the report said.  France was the top-ranked destination for tourists in 2010,
followed by the U.S. and  China , which moved up one place from
the previous year. China, which has passed Spain, Britain and
Italy in the past five years, saw a 9.4 percent increase to 55.7
million visitors. That’s 4 million fewer than visited the U.S.
and well behind France’s world-leading 76.8 million tourists.  The  Middle East , before this year’s unrest, was the
fastest-growing region in 2010, at 14.1 percent, followed by
 Asia  and the Pacific at 12.7 percent and Africa at 7.3 percent.  Tourism as an export category ranks fourth behind “fuels,
chemicals and automotive products,” the UN said, accounting for
5 percent of the global gross domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
