Taser International Inc. (TASR)  and a group
of shareholders settled a lawsuit against financial firms in
which the stun-gun maker alleged stock-price manipulation
through illegal short selling.  Both sides told a federal court in Atlanta they had reached
a binding agreement. The judge yesterday put the case on hold
pending the filing of a dismissal notice. The case was filed in
2008 against companies including  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)   Terms of the settlement are confidential and won’t have to
be approved by the judge, Steven Rosenwasser, a lawyer for Taser
and about 40 of the company’s investors, said today in a
telephone interview.  “After lengthy litigation, the plaintiffs are happy to
have the case resolved,” Rosenwasser said.  In routine short selling, stocks are borrowed and then sold
in anticipation of falling prices in hopes of repaying the loan
with cheaper shares bought at a later date. The Taser investors
accuse the brokerages of so-called naked short selling by
placing electronic orders to sell shares without borrowing the
corresponding shares or actually delivering them to the buyer.  The plaintiffs accused the firms of creating phantom or
counterfeit Taser shares and diluting the value of authentic
shares.  Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Andrea Raphael and  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
& Co. spokesman Pen Pendleton declined to comment.  The case is Taser International v. Morgan Stanley, 10-
03108, U.S. District Court, Northern District of  Georgia 
(Atlanta.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
