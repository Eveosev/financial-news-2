Inflation will stabilize without
sliding into deflation after the  Federal Reserve ’s program to
spur growth by purchasing $600 billion of Treasuries concludes
tomorrow, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.’s  George Goncalves .  Commodity prices will decline as the program, the second
round of a strategy called quantitative easing, ends on
schedule, Goncalves, Nomura’s head of interest-rate strategy in
New York, said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt. The effort, which
began in November, helped push commodities higher, he said.  “As that money stops growing, as the Fed’s balance sheet
stabilizes as of tomorrow, I think that will take away some of
the inflation pressures,” Goncalves said. “We’re not calling
for double dip, we’re not calling for real disinflation, but
lower inflation, sure, and that’s a good thing.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials rose
to a 2011 high of 760.33 on April 8, from 465.46 in May 2010. It
was 670.67 today, after touching a five-month low of 635.27 on
June 27. Crude oil reached a 31-month high of $114.83 in May.
Crude for August delivery traded at $95.07 a barrel in  New York 
today, up 2.4 percent from yesterday.  The U.S. consumer price index increased 3.6 percent last
month from May 2010, Labor Department data showed on June 15. It
was the biggest year-over-year advance since October 2008.  If Nomura’s outlook is wrong and the  U.S. economy  starts to
drop, it still will not reach deflationary levels because the
Fed will step in, Goncalves said.  “We don’t believe in QE3 -- we’ve been very vocal on that
as well -- but if we’re wrong and if the economy actually does
start to dip down into the second half of the year and into the
start of 2012, the Fed will pull out all the stops again,”
Goncalves said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
