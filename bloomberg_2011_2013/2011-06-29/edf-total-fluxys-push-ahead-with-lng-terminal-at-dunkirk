Electricite de France SA,  Europe ’s
biggest power generator, said it will invest 1 billion euros
($1.44 billion) with Fluxys and  Total SA (FP)  to develop a terminal
to import liquefied natural gas at the port of Dunkirk.  The LNG terminal will have a total re-gasification capacity
of 13 billion cubic meters a year, boosting France’s ability to
import natural gas by almost a fifth, according to a statement
from the Paris-based utility. The terminal could start
operations by the end of 2015.  Electricite de France SA will retain a capacity of nearly 8
billion cubic meters a year while Total will reserve 2 billion
cubic meters, the statement said. Bessac-Razel-Soletanche,
Bouygues-Entrepose Contracting and Techint-Sener will build
parts of the installation.  Total, which came under fire from unions and the government
last year for shutting its refinery at Dunkirk, will have a 10
percent stake in the project while Fluxys will have 25 percent,
according to EDF.  GDF Suez SA, the former French gas monopoly, operates
 France ’s three existing LNG terminals at Fos-Tonkin, Montoir-de-
Bretagne and Fos-Cavaou, in which Total has a 28 percent stake.
These have a total regasification capacity of about 25 billion
cubic meters annually.  EDF and GDF Suez are competing on the French market for
duel energy customers who want to buy power and natural gas from
the same supplier. EDF said the import terminal will help secure
its supply of natural gas for thermal power plants.  To contact the reporters on this story:
