The pound declined for a third
consecutive day against the euro, sliding to an almost two month
low versus the shared currency.  Britainâ€™s currency depreciated as much as 0.4 percent to
90.13 pence per euro, the weakest intraday level since May 5,
before trading at 90.02 pence as of 9:08 a.m. in  London . The
pound bought $1.5989, from $1.6001 in  New York  late yesterday.  Gilts fell for a third day, raising 10-year yields by five
basis points to 3.31 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
