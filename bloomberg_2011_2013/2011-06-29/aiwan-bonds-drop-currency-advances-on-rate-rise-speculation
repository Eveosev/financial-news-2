Taiwan ’s government bonds dropped
and the currency strengthened on speculation the  central bank 
will raise borrowing costs tomorrow to tame accelerating
inflation.  The Central Bank of  China  (Taiwan) will lift the benchmark
interest rate by 12.5 basis points to 1.875 percent, according
to all 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The local currency
advanced for a second day as Asian stocks rallied amid signs
Greece may avoid a default.  “The market is pretty much expecting the central bank to
raise interest rates by 12.5 basis points, and that’s been
driving yields up,” said James Wang, a fixed-income trader at
Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “The rally in stocks also led
to weaker bonds.”  The yield on the 1.375 percent notes due March 2021, the
most-traded  government securities , increased one basis point to
1.491 percent as of the 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei, according to
Gretai Securities Market. The rate will rise to 1.53 percent by
the end of the week, Wang forecast. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$28.920
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. close, according
to Taipei Forex Inc.  The consumer-price index rose 1.66 percent in May from a
year earlier, compared with 1.32 percent the previous month, the
government reported this month. Prices will advance 1.83 percent
in June, according to the median estimate of analysts in a
Bloomberg survey before data due on July 5.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, climbed two basis points to 0.365 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
