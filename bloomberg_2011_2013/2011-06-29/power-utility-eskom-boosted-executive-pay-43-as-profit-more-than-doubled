Eskom Holdings Soc Ltd., the South
African utility spending $73 billion to end power shortages,
increased management compensation by 43 percent in the last
fiscal year as it raised salaries and added positions.  Eskom’s two executive directors and five executive-
committee members received a combined 29.2 million rand ($4.3
million) in the 12 months through March, up from 20.4 million
rand a year earlier, according to the utility’s  annual report .
Two committee members were added in the period, while the
departure of former Chief Executive Officer Jacob Maroga in late
2009 cut the number of executive directors from three to two.  The state-owned company, which supplies about 95 percent of
 South Africa ’s power, is spending about 500 billion rand through
2017 expanding plant capacity to avoid a repeat of the shortages
that shut most of the country’s mines for about five days in
January 2008. Full-year profit more than doubled to 8.4 billion
rand as Eskom increased power prices by an average 26 percent.  Brian Dames , CEO of the Johannesburg-based company since
June last year, was paid 5.74 million rand, while Paul O’Flaherty, finance director since January 2010, was paid 4.99
million rand.  The executive committee received a combined 18.5 million
rand, up from 8.8 million rand a year earlier, after Dan Marokane and Chose Choeu were added as chief commercial officer
and corporate affairs head, respectively. Human resources head
Bhabalazi Bulunga received 3.04 million rand, compared with
501,000 rand a year earlier, when he worked for two months.  “Those executives who were in place throughout both
financial years saw their pay packages increase by an average 5
percent or less,” Eskom said in an e-mailed statement today.
“A comparison with similar entities indicates that Eskom’s
executive compensation is towards the lower end of the norm.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
