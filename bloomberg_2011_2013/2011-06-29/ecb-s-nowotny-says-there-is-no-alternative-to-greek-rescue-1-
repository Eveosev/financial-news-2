European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said that there is no alternative
to a Greek rescue.  “In the case of  Greece  once can’t just discuss the
problems of financial policy, but has to bear in mind the role
of the euro,” Nowotny told Austrian construction union members
today. “The euro continues to be the most important and most
stable currency -- and this has to stay that way.”  “It’s a fact that there is no alternative to the rescue
measures, in particular for  Austria  as an export country,”
Nowotny, who also heads Austria’s central bank, said according
to a statement from the union.  The Greek parliament votes today on Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s 78 billion-euro ($112 billion) austerity plan,
needed before the cash-strapped nation can tap a fifth portion
of last year’s 110 billion-euro rescue and euro-area finance
ministers can approve a second aid package.  As Papandreou races to clinch agreement, German finance
ministry officials will meet with banks and insurers in Berlin
today. They will use a French proposal as a blueprint for
discussion to seek an agreement on their role in a Greek rescue,
two people with knowledge of the matter said.  EU leaders and officials have leaned on Papandreou to draw
the widest possible support for a program that runs beyond 2013,
when he is next slated to face the polls. EU Economic and
Monetary Commissioner Olli Rehn said yesterday there is “no
plan B” for the country if the laws aren’t passed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
