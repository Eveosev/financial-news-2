Copper rose to an eight-week high
after reports that more Americans than forecast signed contracts
to buy previously owned homes and Japanese industrial production
expanded.  Last month, pending sales of U.S. existing homes increased
8.2 percent from April, signaling the residential real estate
market may be rebounding. Japanese factory output climbed 5.7
percent in May from April, the fastest pace since 1953. The U.S.
is the world’s second-biggest copper user, and  Japan  is fourth.  “Copper is getting some support from the positive home
sales data,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago. Demand will rise from Japan
as the manufacturing industry “starts to come back on line”
after March’s earthquake and tsunami, he said.  Copper futures for September delivery rose 12.05 cents, or
2.9 percent, to $4.2285 a pound at 11:25 a.m. on the Comex in
 New York . Earlier, the price touched $4.234, the highest since
May 4.  Before today, the metal jumped 33 percent in the past year,
reaching a record $4.6575 on Feb. 15, as the global economic
recovery lifted demand.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed $238, or 2.6 percent, to $9,310 a metric ton
($4.23 a pound).  Aluminum, nickel, tin, zinc and lead also gained in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
