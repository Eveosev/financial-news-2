Cocoa arrivals from Bahia,  Brazil ’s
biggest growing region, plunged 20 percent from a week earlier,
after a public holiday shortened the work week, said analyst
 Thomas Hartmann .  Deliveries to shippers and processors were 61,426 bags in
the week to June 26, Hartmann wrote in a report yesterday. That
compares with 77,143 bags he reported a week earlier. Total
arrivals across Brazil were 79,868 bags, compared with 97,523
bags a week earlier. A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  The latest figures on deliveries may be revised when weekly
data from one of the large grinders comes in, Hartmann said.  Bahia represents almost 80 percent of the country’s cocoa
output and 95 percent of its grindings, Hartmann said in a Jan.
19 e-mail. He is a board member of the Commercial Association of
Bahia and is in charge of the group’s statistical service on
Brazilian cocoa output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
