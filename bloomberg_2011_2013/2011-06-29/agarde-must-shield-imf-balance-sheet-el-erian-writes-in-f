Christine Lagarde , newly installed
as managing director of the International Monetary Fund, should
prepare the fund’s balance sheet for the risk of future
impairment resulting from loans made in the past year, Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive officer of Pacific Investment
Management Co., wrote in the Financial Times.  This is necessary so the fund doesn’t follow the  European
Central Bank  in obscuring a solvency problem by shifting a
member-country’s debt to its own balance sheet, thus becoming
part of the problem rather than part of the solution, the Pimco
chief said.  Lagarde should also restore an appropriate separation
between the IMF job and the political ambitions of the holder, a
separation that’s been damaged by the widely held view that
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn , who resigned as IMF chief last month,
was using the post  as a springboard to the presidency of
France, El-Erian said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
