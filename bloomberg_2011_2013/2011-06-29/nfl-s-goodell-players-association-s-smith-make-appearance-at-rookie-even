National Football League
Commissioner  Roger Goodell  and players’ association chief
DeMaurice Smith appeared together at a orientation for rookies
and said they were working hard to end a lockout that has
shuttered the U.S.’s most-popular sport since March.  Smith said both men felt it was important to attend the
event in Sarasota, Florida, where they answered questions from
rookies and discussed the state of the league.  “Obviously, what we’re trying to do on the business of
football on a macro scale is about getting a fair deal done and
trying to get back to the game and business of football as
quickly as possible,” Smith said in remarks distributed by the
NFL.  Goodell said rules of mediation restricted some of what the
two men could tell the rookies. Owners and players are
discussing how to divide about $9 billion in revenue, the most
of any sports league.  The NFL locked out players in March. The players, led by
Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks  Tom Brady ,  Peyton Manning  and
 Drew Brees , sued the league in federal court for antitrust
violations and wage-fixing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
