Ally Financial Inc., the auto
and home lender that got a $17.2 billion bailout, will record
a second-quarter cost of about $100 million to cover losses
suffered by trusts that bought its mortgages. The firm also got
subpoenas from U.S. investigators relating to home loans.  The cost will help cover losses on insured mortgages where
insurers later canceled the policies because “they believe
certain loan underwriting requirements have not been met,”
Detroit-based Ally said today in a filing. The mortgages had
been sold to trusts, which packaged them into securities to sell
to bond investors.  “These payments resulted from a review of securitized
mortgages as to which  mortgage insurance  was rescinded, although
no claims have been made against us to date with respect to
these mortgages,” Ally said in the filing.  The disclosure was contained in an  update  to the
prospectus, initially filed in March, for the company’s planned
public share offering. The share sale has been delayed until
equity markets improve, a person familiar with the plans said
earlier this month.  Ally, 74 percent owned by the U.S. Treasury Department,
also said in the filing that it has received subpoenas from the
 U.S. Department of Justice  and the Securities and Exchange
Commission relating to how it handled mortgages.  The DOJ subpoena “includes a broad request for
documentation and other information in connection with its
investigation of potential fraud” tied to the origination or
underwriting of home loans, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
