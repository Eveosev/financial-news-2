The  Philippines  reported a budget
deficit in May as revenue growth slowed.  The shortfall was 9.6 billion pesos ($220 million) last
month, compared with a 26.3 billion-peso surplus reported
earlier for April, the government said in an e-mailed statement
in Manila today. Revenue rose 9.5 percent from a year earlier,
easing from a previously reported 11.1 percent for April.
Spending fell 7.5 percent.  President  Benigno Aquino , who completes his first year in
office this month, has gone after tax evaders and corrupt
officials to narrow the budget gap from a record 314.5 billion
pesos in 2010.  Fitch Ratings  raised the country’s debt to one
step below investment grade on June 23, days after Moody’s
Investors Service upgraded the Philippines to the highest rating
since the start of 2005.  “The government is definitely on the right track,” Roland Avante, treasurer at Sterling Bank of  Asia  in Manila, said
before the report. “This is proven by the rating upgrades we’ve
had. Efforts to raise revenue and manage spending are showing
results.”  The budget deficit was 9.54 billion pesos in the five
months through May, from 162.1 billion pesos a year earlier, the
report showed.  Fitch raised the country’s long-term foreign currency bond
rating last week to BB+ from BB, with a stable outlook. The
Southeast Asian nation’s rating was increased to Ba2 from Ba3 by
Moody’s on June 15, two steps below investment grade.  Standard &
Poor’s  in November increased its rating on Philippine debt for
the first time since 1997, boosting it to BB, the second-highest
non-investment grade.  Next year, the government aims to narrow the budget deficit
to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product, or about 270 billion
pesos, from a target of 3.2 percent this year, or about 300
billion pesos.  To contact the reporters on this story:
