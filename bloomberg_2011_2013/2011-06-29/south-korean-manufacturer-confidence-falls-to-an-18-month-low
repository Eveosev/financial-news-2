South Korean manufacturers’
confidence slipped to an 18-month low amid increasing concern
that rising production costs, weak domestic demand and the
strengthening won will curb growth.  An index measuring expectations for July dropped to 90 from
97 for June, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement in  Seoul 
today. A measure of non-manufacturing companies’ expectations
declined to 84 from 86.  The survey was conducted from June 15 to June 22 and was
based on responses from 1,652 manufacturers and 909 non-
manufacturers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
