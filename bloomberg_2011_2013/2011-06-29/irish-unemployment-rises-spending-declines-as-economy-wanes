Irish unemployment rose and retail
sales declined as the economy struggled to emerge from recession
after three years of contraction.  Unemployment rose to 14.2 percent in June from 14.1 percent
in May and 13.4 percent a year earlier, the  Central Statistics
Office  in Cork said on its website today. Retail sales fell 2.1
percent in May from a year earlier, it said in a separate
report.  “Households are likely to remain nervous about employment
prospects and maintain their emergency saving,” said Conall MacCoille, an economist at Dublin-based securities firm Davy.
They “clearly continue to struggle.”  Ireland’s jobless rate has more than trebled over the last
four years, as a decade-long real-estate bubble burst. With
unemployment showing few signs of declining and  Greece ’s
government trying to stave off a default, Irish  consumer
confidence  fell in June to the lowest in four months after
increasing in the early part of the year.  Jobless claims rose 2,900 to 446,800 in June from the
previous month, the statistics office said. In May, retail sales
rose 1.3 percent on the month, boosted by car sales as a “cash
for clunkers” program nears an end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
