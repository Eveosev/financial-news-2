Goldoni SpA, an Italian farm
machinery producer, signed a letter of intent to buy a stake in
21. Maj d.o.o., a Serbian maker of small engines.  Goldoni plans to buy 70.6 percent of the Serbian state-
controlled company and invest 10 million euros ($14.4 million)
over the next three years, General Manager Andrea Goldoni and
 Serbia ’s Economy Minister Nebojsa Ciric said as they signed the
document in Belgrade today.  The Modena-based maker of two-wheeled tractors and mowers
wants to outsource part of its production to Serbia because of
the Balkan country’s free-trade agreement with  Russia , Goldoni
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
