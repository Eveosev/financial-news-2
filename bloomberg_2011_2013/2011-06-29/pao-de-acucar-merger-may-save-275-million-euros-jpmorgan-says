The proposal to merge  Carrefour SA (CA) ’s
Brazilian assets with retailer Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao
Grupo Pao de Acucar may save the combined company 150 million to
275 million euros ($396.4 million) a year, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
said.  Banco BTG Pactual SA investment fund Gama, which proposed
the deal yesterday, said the combination would produce savings
of 700 million euros a year. Carrefour rival Casino Guichard-
Perrachon SA called the proposal “illegal.” Casino owns 37
percent of Pao de Acucar and would gain control of the company
next year under a 2005 accord.  JPMorgan maintains a “cautious view” on the plan because
of the “execution risk” involved, according to an e-mail to
clients today from analysts including Andrea Teixeira. They rate
Pao de Acucar “underweight.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
