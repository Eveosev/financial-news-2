CA Inc. (CA)  agreed to buy closely held
Interactive TKO Inc. for $330 million in cash, adding software
services that let developers simulate how their applications
will run.  The acquisition is expected to be completed within three
months, the Islandia, New York-based company, which operates as
CA Technologies, and Interactive TKO said in a statement today.
Interactive TKO will become a division managed by Shridhar Mittal, currently its chief executive officer, they said.  “ITKO’s technology allows customers to anticipate how
their applications will perform in alternate environments,
significantly reducing risk” and getting them to market faster,
David Dobson, a CA Technologies executive vice president, said
in the statement.  The acquisition of Plano, Texas-based Interactive TKO is
expected to reduce CA’s earnings per share this fiscal year and
next, based on generally accepted accounting principles,
according to the statement. The companies didn’t provide
figures.  CA rose 17 cents to $22.63 at 5:19 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have declined
7.4 percent this year  To contact the reporter on this story:
