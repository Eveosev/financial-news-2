GreenVolts Inc., a closely held
developer of concentrating solar power systems, received about
$39 million in venture capital financing.  The funding includes $22.4 million received in December
from  Oak Investment Partners  and other existing and new
investors, David Gudmundson, the Fremont, California-based
company’s chief executive officer, said today by telephone. He
wouldn’t name the other backers.  The financing will be used to build equipment for projects
that include a 1-megawatt plant at Arizona Western College. The
company is also developing a Byron, California, project  for
utility Pacific Gas & Electric Co. using  “completely
redesigned” technology, he said.  Details of GreenVolts’ “next generation” systems will be
announced in the coming months, Gudmundson said, and will still
use concentrating photovoltaic technology incorporating high-
efficiency solar cells from suppliers such as  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s
Spectrolab Inc. unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
