Aluminum alloy stockpiles tracked by
the London Metal Exchange rose to the highest level in more than
nine years, while inventories of primary aluminum extended their
drop to the longest in almost seven years.  Stocks of aluminum alloy, used to make parts for  car
engines , increased 1,960 metric tons to 121,180 tons, the
highest since February 2002, LME data showed today. Inventories
gained in  Singapore  and  South Korea  and are up 61 percent this
month.  Aluminum inventories declined 13,300 tons, or 0.3 percent,
to 4.51 million tons, the lowest level since Jan. 20. That was
the 25th consecutive drop, the longest streak since Aug. 26,
2004. Stockpiles have dropped 4.2 percent since May 24,
according to exchange figures.  Orders to remove aluminum from warehouses, or canceled
warrants, gained 6,650 tons, or 1.5 percent, to 458,400 tons.
They tripled at warehouses in Gwangyang, South Korea.  Zinc canceled warrants rose 1,350 tons to 49,525 tons, the
highest level since September. The increase was driven by a
3,000-ton gain in Port Klang,  Malaysia . Zinc stockpiles fell
1,650 tons to 864,400 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
