Bearish options on an exchange-
traded fund tracking the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were the
most-active U.S. contracts after a single “butterfly” spread
trade betting that the ETF will slump 2.8 percent in two weeks.  An investor sold 92,000 July $126 puts on the  SPDR S&P 500
ETF Trust (SPY)  while buying 46,000 each of the July $123 and $129
puts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and  Trade Alert
LLC . The ETF rose 0.9 percent to $130.72 as of 4 p.m. in New
York. The trade profits most if the fund falls to the middle
strike of $126 by expiration on July 15, and loses money if the
fund is above about the upper strike or below the lower one.  “It’s either a hedge or it’s a bet that we’re going to
move down,” said Alex Panagiotidis, managing director for
equity derivatives at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. in New York.
“It’s a smart way to play it because you don’t have to lay out
a lot of premium.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slumped 4.9 percent from
its 2011 high on April 29 through yesterday as Europe’s debt
crisis threatened to reduce economic growth and the Citigroup
Economic Surprise Index for the U.S., which measures whether
reports exceed forecasts, fell to a 29-month low on June 3. The
benchmark gauge for American equities has retreated for seven of
the past eight weeks.  The butterfly strategy takes its name from the strategy’s
payout diagram, which resembles the insect’s outstretched wings,
and involves selling the middle contract and buying the two
outside ones. The $126 strike is 2.8 percent below yesterday’s
close and below this year’s lowest closing level for the fund.  To contact the reporters on this story:
