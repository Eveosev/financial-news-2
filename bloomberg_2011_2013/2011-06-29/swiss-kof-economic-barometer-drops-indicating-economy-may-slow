Switzerland ’s economic barometer
fell in June, adding to signs the franc’s ascent and a faltering
euro-region economy may hurt economic growth.  The monthly gauge that aims to predict the economy’s
direction about six months ahead dropped to 2.23 from 2.30 in
May, the  KOF Swiss Economic Institute  in Zurich said in an e-
mailed statement today. That’s in line with the median forecast
of 10 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Switzerland’s economy is showing some signs of cooling as
the franc’s 10 percent gain versus the euro over the past year
and faltering demand in the single-currency area are curbing
export growth. Foreign sales declined 1.5 percent in May and the
government on June 14 lowered its forecast for 2012 economic
growth to 1.5 percent from 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
