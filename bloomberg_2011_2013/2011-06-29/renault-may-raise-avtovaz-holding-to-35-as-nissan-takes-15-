Renault SA (RNO)  may seek to raise its
stake in Russian carmaker  AvtoVAZ (AVAZ)  to 35 percent from 25 percent,
under “one hypothesis” in talks to increase the holding,
Rachel Konrad, a spokeswoman for the Renault-Nissan alliance,
said today by phone. She was confirming comments that  Carlos
Ghosn , chief executive officer of both Renault and Nissan Motor
Co., made to analysts this week.  Under the scenario, Nissan would take a 15 percent stake as
the alliance seeks to raise its combined stake in AvtoVAZ to 50
percent. Renault will be the “dominant partner” in AvtoVAZ as
talks continue “behind closed doors,” Konrad said, declining
to comment on details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
