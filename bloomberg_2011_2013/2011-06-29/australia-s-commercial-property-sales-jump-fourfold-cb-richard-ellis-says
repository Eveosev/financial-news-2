Australian commercial property sales
in the second quarter soared by more than four times the value
of transactions in the previous three months, when natural
disasters dampened activity, real estate services firm  CB
Richard Ellis Group Inc. (CBG)  said.  Commercial property investments jumped to A$2.7 billion
($2.85 billion) in the second quarter, compared with A$638
million in the three months ended March 31, CBRE said in an e-
mailed report based on preliminary data. The value of sales was
14 percent above the long-term quarterly average, it said.  “Floods and cyclones in Queensland, the Japanese and New
Zealand earthquakes and general global uncertainty all conspired
to create a very slow start to the investment year in 2011,”
CBRE’s Sydney-based Executive Director Kevin Stanley said in the
statement. “However, many of the mid-to-major sized
transactions in the pipeline since late 2010 have now finally
reached conclusion, which contributed to the significant spike
in sales activity.”  While  consumer spending  has slowed over the past few months,
investors remain convinced retail property will remain a
“strong and stable investment asset class” in the long term,
he said.  Office property transactions accounted for 52 percent of
the sales, retail for 40 percent and industrial for the rest,
Los Angeles-based CBRE said. Overseas investors bought 37
percent of the properties sold, compared with an average of 10
percent to 15 percent, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
