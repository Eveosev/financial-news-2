Members of the Icelandic central
bank’s policy board discussed increasing the benchmark interest
rate by 25 basis points, according to minutes of the bank’s June
14 rate meeting, published today.  The Monetary Policy Committee “considered two options:
keeping rates unchanged and raising them by 0.25 percentage
points,” the minutes showed. “The governor proposed that the
bank’s  interest rates  be kept unchanged.” All five members
supported the proposal “although one member would have
preferred to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points,
placing more emphasis on factors suggesting greater inflationary
risks,” according to the minutes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
