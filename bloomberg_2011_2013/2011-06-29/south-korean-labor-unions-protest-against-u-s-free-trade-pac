South Korean labor unions, students
and farmers opposed to the planned free trade agreement with the
U.S. rallied in central  Seoul  today, blocking traffic for more
than hour.  As many as 5,000 demonstrators who had planned to march to
President Lee Myung Bak’s official residence were turned back by
police, said Lee Seung Chul, a policy director at the Seoul-
based  Korean Confederation of Trade Unions , which organized the
protest. They also urged the government to make changes in  labor
laws , Lee said by telephone.  South Korea’s National Assembly has yet to ratify the trade
pact while in the U.S., President  Barack Obama  is seeking to
overcome opposition from some members of Congress.  South Korea’s free trade agreement with the European Union
takes effect on July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
