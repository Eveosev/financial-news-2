(Corrects cash holdings in third paragraph.)  China South City Holdings Ltd. (1668)  said
it has the funds for a 20 billion yuan ($3.1 billion) planned
property venture in Harbin, brushing aside concerns it may face
liquidity problems.  Moody’s Investors Services placed China South City’s debt
rating on review for a possible downgrade on June 21 because the
company’s planned investment in Harbin “could greatly escalate
its financial and operating risk.”  “We are holding about HK$4.5 billion ($580 million) cash
including the issue of $250 million senior notes in January,
which should be comfortable for the expansion,” Stephen Fung,
China South City’s chief financial officer, told reporters after
a meeting with shareholders in  Hong Kong  today. “The Harbin
project will be separated into different phases. I expect every
phase to recover the cost within four years after launch.”  Moody’s said the investment amount, which will be spent
over 10 years, is far bigger than the company’s existing
developments in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city. China South
City said in a June 16 filing it will own 51 percent of the
joint venture company that will develop the project.  The stock, which is traded in Hong Kong, fell 17 percent
this year, compared with 4.2 percent drop in the city’s
benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   To contact the reporter on this story
