Singapore ’s  inflation  rate exceeded
5 percent for a fifth month as prices of transportation and
housing surged.  The  consumer price index  rose 5.4 percent in October from a
year earlier, the Department of Statistics said in a statement
today. That compares with the 5.2 percent median estimate of 16
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg News. Inflation was 5.5 percent
in September, according to previously reported data.  Singapore’s central bank, which uses the island’s dollar to
manage prices, said last month it will slow gains in its
currency, joining other Asian policy makers in trying to juggle
inflation pressures with protecting growth amid a faltering
global recovery. The trade ministry predicts economic expansion
will slow next year and a central bank official said this week
the monetary policy stance remains “appropriate.”  “Wage inflation pressures from the still tight labor
market” may be keeping services costs and inflation elevated,
Kit Wei Zheng, a Singapore-based economist at Citigroup Inc.,
said before the report. Accommodation costs are also a source of
inflation, he said.  The  Singapore dollar  fell about 2.5 percent against its U.S.
counterpart in the past month, the second-worst performer among
10 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Inflation will average about 5 percent this year and 2.5
percent to 3.5 percent in 2012, the central bank said last month.  Prices rose 0.4 percent last month from September, without
adjusting for seasonal factors, today’s report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
