More New Zealand consumers expect
 house prices  to rise in the next 12 months as demand spurred by
record-low  interest rates  outstrips supply.  Sixty-four percent of respondents in an October survey
expected values will increase over the next year compared with
61 percent in July, ASB Bank Ltd. said in an e-mailed report.
The proportion that expects lower prices dropped to 8 percent
from 11 percent.  Rising values may limit the central bank’s scope to cut
rates in an economy where unemployment soared to a 13-year high
and retail sales slumped last quarter. Fewer consumers expect
higher borrowing costs over the next year and 42 percent predict
no change, the most since 1999, the survey showed.  “This more widespread belief that interest rates will
remain low could underpin demand” for houses, Auckland-based
ASB Chief Economist  Nick Tuffley  said in the report.
“Expectations of higher prices are firmly embedded.”  Tuffley is one of 13 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News 
last week who forecast the central bank will keep the official
cash rate at a record-low 2.5 percent until at least July. Three
predict a rate rise in the first half.  House prices  rose 6.9 percent in October from a year
earlier, the Real Estate Institute said Nov. 9. In Auckland,
home to a third of the nation’s 4.4 million people, values
surged 14.4 percent amid a shortage of new listings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
