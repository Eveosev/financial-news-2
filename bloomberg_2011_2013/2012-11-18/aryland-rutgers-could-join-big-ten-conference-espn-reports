The University of Maryland is in
serious negotiations to join the Big Ten Conference,  ESPN
reported , without saying where it got the information.  Should Maryland leave the Atlantic Coast Conference for the
Big Ten,  Rutgers University  in New Jersey then may also join the
league and exit the  Big East , ESPN said.  Maryland president Wallace Loh has been handling
discussions with Big Ten officials and an announcement could
come as soon as tomorrow, ESPN said. Big Ten and ACC officials
didnâ€™t immediately respond to messages seeking comment.  The additions of Maryland and Rutgers would give the Big
Ten conference 14 members, though Maryland may face financial
obstacles, according to ESPN. The ACC recently raised its exit
fee for schools leaving the conference to $50 million and
Maryland last year cut eight sports to save money. The buyout
for Rutgers to leave the Big East would be $10 million if the
schools provides 27 months notice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
