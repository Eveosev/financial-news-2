The Baltimore Ravens got a 63-yard
punt return for a touchdown to beat Pittsburgh 13-10, dropping
the Steelers’ record to 0-5 against division rivals when playing
without quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger .  Jacoby Jones scored on a return for the third time this
season for the Ravens, who improved to 8-2 and halted the
Steelers’ four-game National Football League winning streak.  Roethlisberger missed the game with a sprained shoulder and
dislocated rib as the Steelers (6-4) lost at home for the first
time in five games. Seven of the last nine regular-season games
between the Ravens and Steelers have been decided by exactly
three points, including the past five in Pittsburgh.  The New York Jets ended their three-game losing streak with
yesterday’s 27-13 win at the St. Louis Rams, while the New
England Patriots set a franchise scoring record in rolling past
the visiting Indianapolis Colts 59-24.  The Houston Texans beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 43-37 in
one of three games that went to overtime in Week 11 of the
National Football League. The Jaguars, Cleveland Browns and
Carolina Panthers all blew second-half leads of more than 10
points before losing in overtime.  Mark Sanchez  threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Chaz Schilens and  Nick Folk  kicked a pair of 51-yard field goals as
the Jets opened a 13-7 lead in St. Louis. Bilal Powell added two
rushing touchdowns in the fourth quarter for New York (4-6),
which has won its past two meetings with the Rams (3-6-1) after
a seven-game losing streak in the series.  The Patriots beat Indianapolis as  Tom Brady  threw three
touchdown passes, Julian Edelman returned a punt 68 yards for a
score, and Aqib Talib and Alfonzo Dennard both returned
interceptions of Colts quarterback  Andrew Luck  for touchdowns.
Luck had three interceptions and also lost a fumble.  Win Streak  New England has won four straight games to improve to 7-3,
while the Colts (6-4) had a four-game winning streak snapped.  The Texans avoided an upset at home against Jacksonville as
 Matt Schaub  threw his fifth touchdown pass of the game, a 48-
yarder to  Andre Johnson , with two minutes left in overtime.
Schaub, who finished with 527 yards passing, threw two touchdown
passes in the final 5:42 of regulation as Houston rallied from
14 points down. Schaub’s passing yardage total was tied for the
second most in NFL history, behind only the 554 yards by Norm Van Brocklin in 1951.  Both the Texans and Jaguars made field goals on their first
possession in overtime before Schaub’s winning touchdown pass on
Houston’s third drive in extra time. The Texans improved to 9-1
on the season, while the Jaguars, who were 15-point underdogs,
fell to 1-9.  Overtime Wins  The  Dallas Cowboys  sent Cleveland to its 12th straight road
loss, winning 23-20 on Dan Bailey’s 38-yard field goal in
overtime. Bailey had made a tying 32-yard field goal with two
seconds left in the fourth quarter for the Cowboys (5-5), who
fought back from a 13-0 halftime deficit.  The Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Panthers 27-21 in
overtime after rallying from a 21-10 fourth-quarter deficit. The
Buccaneers (6-4) tied the game with 20 seconds left in
regulation as Josh Freeman and Vincent Jackson hooked up for a
24-yard touchdown pass and then a two-point conversion.  The  Green Bay Packers  scored 10 points in the last 2:02 to
beat the Detroit Lions 24-20 on the road yesterday and extend
their winning streak to five games.  The Atlanta Falcons overcame five interceptions by  Matt Ryan  to beat the Arizona Cardinals 23-19 and improve to 9-1. The
New Orleans Saints won for the fifth time in six games following
an 0-4 start, beating the Oakland Raiders 38-17 as  Drew Brees 
threw three touchdown passes.  Slumping Eagles  In other Week 11 games, the Washington Redskins sent the
Philadelphia Eagles to a sixth straight loss, winning 31-6 as
Robert Griffin III threw four touchdown passes; the Denver
Broncos beat the San Diego Chargers 30-23 behind Peyton Manning’s three touchdown passes, and the Cincinnati Bengals
cruised past the Kansas City Chiefs 28-6.  The  Chicago Bears  visit the San Francisco 49ers tonight.  The Week 11 schedule started on Nov. 15 as the Buffalo
Bills beat the Miami Dolphins 19-14.  The  New York Giants ,  Minnesota Vikings ,  Seattle Seahawks 
and Tennessee Titans were off this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
