Soaring costs for Argentine credit-
default swaps arenâ€™t a sign the country is heading toward
default, Economy Minister Hernan Lorenzino said in an interview
with newspaper Pagina/12.  Speculators are pushing the costs of Argentine credit-
default swaps higher, Lorenzino told the Buenos Aires-based
daily. The government will continue paying bondholders who
agreed to debt restructurings in 2005 and 2010 while refusing to
issue payments to holders of defaulted securities who are suing
the country, Pagina/12 said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
