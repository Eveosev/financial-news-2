The University of  Notre Dame  is
poised to grab the No. 1 spot in the Bowl Championship Series
rankings after losses by college football’s top two teams --
Kansas State and the University of Oregon.  No. 1 Kansas State was upset 52-24 at Baylor last night
while second-ranked Oregon lost 17-14 in overtime to Stanford.
It was the third time the top two teams were beaten on the same
day since the BCS rankings began in 1998.  Notre Dame, ranked third in the BCS entering the week,
routed Wake Forest 38-0 yesterday to improve its record to 11-0
for the first time since its 1988 national championship season.
The Fighting Irish, who finish their regular season next week at
the  University of Southern California , will probably claim the
No. 1 spot when updated BCS rankings are released today.  Fourth-ranked  Alabama  may also be a beneficiary of the
losses by Kansas State and Oregon. Alabama, which routed Western
Carolina 49-0 yesterday, had been No. 1 for the first four weeks
of the BCS standings before losing 29-24 last week to  Texas A&M .
This is the first time since 2007 that the No. 1 team in the BCS
has lost in consecutive weeks.  The top two teams in the final BCS standings on Dec. 2 will
play for the national championship Jan. 7 in Miami.  Notre Dame has never been No. 1 in the BCS rankings and
last sat atop the national polls in 1993. Quarterback Everett
Golson threw three touchdown passes as the Irish opened a 31-0
halftime lead on Wake Forest yesterday in  South Bend ,  Indiana .  Kansas State (10-1) fell behind 28-7 in the second quarter
in Waco,  Texas , and never got closer than nine points the rest
of the way. Baylor (5-5) rolled up 580 yards of offense, as
Lache Seastrunk rushed for 185 yards and a touchdown, and Glasco
Martin ran for 113 yards and three scores.  Wildcats Struggle  “They took the fight to us and I didn’t have them well-
enough prepared for it,” Kansas State coach Bill Snyder told
reporters. “We struggled on both sides of the ball.”  Oregon (10-1) lost at home as Stanford scored the tying
touchdown with one minute, 35 seconds left in the fourth quarter
and Jordan Williamson made a 37-yard field goal in overtime. The
Ducks missed a 41-yard field goal on the first possession in
extra time, as Alejandro Maldonado’s kick bounced off the left
upright.  No. 13 Stanford (9-2) overcame three turnovers and limited
an  Oregon  offense that entered the game averaging 54.8 points,
the most at college football’s top level. The Ducks hadn’t
scored fewer than 42 points in any of their first 10 games.  “We’re proud to survive our mistakes and in the end pull
it out,” said Stanford freshman quarterback Ken Hogan, who was
making his first road start.  Critical Call  Hogan ran for a touchdown and threw the tying 10-yard
scoring pass to tight end Zach Ertz in the closing minutes.
Officials initially ruled Ertz landed out of bounds before the
call was reversed by instant replay.  “It’s tough, but I told them things don’t always go your
way,” Oregon coach Chip Kelly said at a news conference. “It
hurts so bad because they’ve invested so much.”  Ohio State improved to 11-0 yesterday with a 21-14 overtime
victory against  Wisconsin , yet the Buckeyes are ineligible for
the postseason because of National Collegiate Athletic
Association violations that occurred under former coach  Jim
Tressel . Ohio State can’t be ranked in the BCS standings or play
for the Big Ten or national titles.  No. 5  Georgia  (10-1), No. 6 Florida (10-1), No. 8 Texas A&M
(9-2) and No. 9  South Carolina  (9-2) all won yesterday against
schools in the Football Championship Subdivision, the sport’s
second level. Seventh-ranked Louisiana State (9-2) beat
Mississippi 41-35 on a one-yard touchdown run by Jeremy Hill
with 15 seconds left, while No. 10 Florida State is 10-1 after a
41-14 win over  Maryland .  UCLA, which entered the weekend ranked 17th, beat No. 18
USC 38-28 to claim a spot in the Pacific-12 championship game as
the conference’s South Division winner. UCLA (9-2) also knocked
USC quarterback Matt Barkley out of the game with a shoulder
injury, putting his status for the Trojans’ Nov. 24 matchup
against Notre Dame in question.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
