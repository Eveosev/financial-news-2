Ocado Group Plc (OCDO) , the U.K. online
grocer, said it is not in immediate danger of breaching its
lending covenants.  “Ocado is not about to breach its covenants,” the company
said in an e-mailed statement. “We have reiterated this for
months. Our banks know this and remain supportive of our
business model and plan.”  The Sunday Times reported that the company is in talks with
its lenders, without saying where it got the information. The
report said that the covenants require Ocado’s net debt to be
less than 3.5 times earnings, and Ocado was asking its banks to
reset the covenants or waive the test altogether.  A spokeswoman for Ocado declined to comment on whether the
company was in talks with its banks.  Ocado’s sales growth slowed in the third quarter, rising
9.9 percent from a year earlier compared with 12 percent in the
first half. Chief Executive Officer Tim Steiner said in
September that the company will consider selling and leasing
back a warehouse if necessary to avoid breaching debt covenants.
Steiner said at the time that Ocado wasn’t close to a covenant
breach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
