Radek Stepanek  defeated Nicolas Almagro in four sets in Prague to give the  Czech Republic  a 3-2
win over defending champion Spain in the final of tennis’s Davis
Cup.  The Czechs held a 2-1 lead going into today’s matches.
 David Ferrer  leveled the score at 2-2 with a 6-2, 6-3, 7-5
victory over Tomas Berdych, who was involved in a four-hour
singles match two days ago and the doubles yesterday. Then
Stepanek defeated Almagro 6-4, 7-6 (7-0), 3-6, 6-3 in the
decider.  Two days ago Ferrer defeated Stepanek 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 and
Berdych beat Almagro 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3. Yesterday
Berdych and Stepanek beat Marcel Granollers and Marc Lopez 3-6,
7-5, 7-5, 6-3 in the doubles to give the Czechs a 2-1 lead.  The Czech Republic previously won the competition, the top
team event in men’s tennis, as part of the former Czechoslovakia
in 1980. Spain was aiming for a fourth Davis Cup title in five
years and a sixth victory overall.  Spain, which was without the injured  Rafael Nadal  this
weekend, beat Argentina in the 2008 and 2011 finals, and was
host for the 2009 win over the Czech Republic.  Serbia is the only other team to claim the trophy since the
U.S. had the last of its  record 32 titles  in 2007.  The latest victory completes a double for the Czech
Republic, whose women two weeks ago retained the Fed Cup title
with victory over Serbia.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
