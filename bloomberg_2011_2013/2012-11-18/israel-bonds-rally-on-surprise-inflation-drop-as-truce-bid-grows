Israel ’s benchmark bonds rallied,
pushing the yield down the most in almost three weeks, as a
surprise drop in inflation spurred demand and regional leaders
raced to broker a truce between Israelis and Palestinians.  The yield on the 5.5 percent Mimshal Shiklit bonds due
January 2022 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point,
the biggest decline since Oct. 30, to 3.95 percent at the close
in Tel Aviv. The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference
between the inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government
notes of similar maturity, slumped 28 basis points to 205,
implying an average annual inflation rate of 2.05 percent.  Annual  inflation  slowed to 1.8 percent in October from 2.1
percent the previous month, the  Central Bureau of Statistics 
said on Nov. 15 after markets closed. That was below the 2.2
percent median estimate of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi said late yesterday that there
are indications an agreement to halt the fighting that killed 60
Palestinians and three Israelis may be reached. The benchmark
yield rose nine basis points last week amid the tension.  “The market is adjusting inflation expectations downwards
after consumer prices came out lower than forecast as consumer
demand and economic growth slows,” said Avihay Hermon, a bond
trader at Psagot Investment House Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “There
aren’t any inflationary pressures at the moment, which is
prompting investors to sell consumer price-linked bonds and buy
non-linked  government bonds .”  The yield on the 1 percent inflation-linked notes due May
2017 rose five basis points to 0.368 percent, highest since Oct.
29. Israel’s economic growth slowed to an annualized 2.9 percent
in the third quarter from 3.4 percent in the previous three
months, the statistics bureau said today. Seven analysts had
forecast growth of 3.4 percent.  Lower Rates  The  European debt crisis  and slower global expansion has
weighed on Israel’s economy this year, with growth likely to
slow to 3.5 percent this year from 4.6 percent in 2011,
according to the bureau’s forecasts in September. More than 40
percent of Israel’s gross domestic product is made up of exports
and  Europe  is one of the top destinations.  The  Bank of Israel  lowered the benchmark  interest rate  to 2
percent at the end of October, citing a high level of global
economic risk and slowing domestic growth.  Two-year interest
rate swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for the
benchmark rate in the period, plunged six basis points, the
biggest decrease since Oct. 29, to 1.97 percent on Nov. 16.  The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, declined for a third day,
slipping 0.1 percent to 278.79. Local funds raised a net 702
million shekels ($177 million) in the week ended Nov. 15, 40
percent less than in the previous week, Meitav Investment House
Ltd. said today.  The shekel strengthened 0.3 percent to 3.9664 a dollar on
Nov. 16, trimming last week’s decline to 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
