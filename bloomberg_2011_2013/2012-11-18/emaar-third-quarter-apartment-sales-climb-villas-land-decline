     Nov. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Emaar Properties PJSC, the developer
of the world’s tallest tower in Dubai, said quarterly revenue
from apartment sales more than doubled from a year earlier. Sale
of villas, commercial units and land dropped.  Revenue from apartment sales climbed to 567 million dirhams
($154 million) in the three months ended Sept. 30 from 183
million dirhams a year earlier, according to Emaar’s financial
 statement posted  on Dubai’s stock market today. Revenue from
sale of villas fell to 123 million dirhams from 126 million
dirhams, while income from the sale of land and commercial units
declined to 109 million dirhams from 798 million dirhams.  Emaar said on Oct. 23 third-quarter profit dropped 4.7
percent to 387 million dirhams, missing analysts’ estimates,
after revenue declined. The company provided a breakdown of
revenue today.  The developer said the money owed by Amlak Finance PJSC,
the mortgage lender being reorganized by the United Arab
Emirates’ government, was lowered to 242 million dirhams at the
end of September from 595 million dirhams at the end of last
year. The amount is unsecured and earns an average return of
1.45 percent a year compared with 3.13 percent to 4 percent last
year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
