The fastest-growing U.S. demographic group is highly educated, relatively affluent and, politically, increasingly Democratic. That's Asian-Americans, who comprised 3 percent of this year's electorate, a share that will keep growing. They voted almost three to one for President  Barack Obama , according to the exit poll. Yet unlike African Americans or  Latinos , Asian Americans are more highly educated -- half have at least bachelor's degrees -- and are more affluent than whites. Why then did they  support  the more liberal party? James Lai, a professor of political science at Santa Clara University, offers several explanations for this trend in favor the Democrats in recent presidential contests. Although polls show immigration isn't a top concern for Asian-Americans, he believes it may be a threshold test: Candidates who are seen as anti-immigration are disqualified from consideration. In 2010, Asian-Americans accounted for more than one-third of all new immigrants to the U.S. Lai says he suspects that  Mitt Romney 's anti-China rhetoric during the campaign also may have affected some Chinese-Americans, who are the single largest Asian-American bloc, followed closely by Filipinos. In addition, he says that many Asian-Americans identify more with the values of fairness and opportunity articulated by Obama in the election. "Most Asian-Americans identify with the middle class," says Lai, who has written a book on Asian-Americans and politics.   He says it’s a mistake to stereotype Asian-Americans, who represent at least 25 different ethnicities, as a monolithic group. The political influence of Asian-American voters is spreading geographically, no longer concentrated on the West Coast. States such as Virginia,  North Carolina  and  Florida  have growing populations that are flexing their muscle. ( Albert R.
