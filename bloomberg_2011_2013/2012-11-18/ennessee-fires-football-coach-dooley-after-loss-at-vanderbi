The University of  Tennessee  fired
coach Derek Dooley one day after a 41-18 loss at Vanderbilt
University.  Director of Athletics Dave Hart said offensive coordinator
Jim Chaney will serve as interim head coach for the Vols’ season
finale on Nov. 24 at home in Knoxville, Tennessee, against the
University of  Kentucky .  Tennessee (4-7) has lost all seven of its Southeastern
Conference games this season. A loss to Kentucky would leave it
winless in SEC play for the first time in school history.  “Derek and I met early this morning, and I informed him
that I believed a change in leadership, despite the positive
contributions he has made to the overall health of the program,
was in the best long-term interests of Tennessee football,”
Hart said in a statement on the school’s website.  Dooley, 44, who had four years left on his contract, had a
15-21 record in three seasons at Tennessee and was 4-19 in SEC
play.  The loss to Vanderbilt clinched a third straight losing
season for the Volunteers, the first such streak since 1909-11.
Tennessee had won its previous 14 games at in-state rival
Vanderbilt (7-4).   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
