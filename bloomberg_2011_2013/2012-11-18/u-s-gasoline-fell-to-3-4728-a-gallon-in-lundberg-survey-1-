The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps fell 7.26 cents in the past two weeks to
$3.4728 a gallon, according to the Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended Nov. 16 and is based on
information obtained from about 2,500 stations by the Camarillo,
California-based company. The average is up 9.21 cents from a
year earlier. Gasoline is 49 cents below the year-to-date high
of $3.9671 on April 6.  “The decline is big enough to be a help to consumers in a
shaky economy,”  Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg Survey,
said yesterday in a telephone interview. The decline was the
result of lower demand at beginning of daylight saving time and
 Hurricane Sandy , she said.  U.S. gasoline demand sank to an eight-month low in the week
ended Nov. 9 after Hurricane Sandy disrupted travel and the
distribution of fuel supplies on the East Coast, according to
data from MasterCard Inc.  Drivers bought 8.39 million barrels a day of gasoline in
the week ended Nov. 9, down from 8.46 million the prior week,
MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report showed.  Gasoline futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  rose
13.65 cents, or 5.3 percent, to $2.7101 a gallon in the past two
weeks amid concern damage from the storm would reduce supplies
around  New York  Harbor, the contract’s delivery point.  Gas Stations  Sandy, which went ashore Oct. 29 near  Atlantic City ,  New
Jersey , shut refineries and terminals in the New York
metropolitan area, curbing gasoline production and the
distribution of supplies through the Northeast.  Fuel was offered for as much as $8 a gallon on Craigslist
in the New York area while drivers there were forced to wait in
hours-long lines to fuel up.  AAA , the nation’s largest motoring group, said 80 percent
to 85 percent of gas stations in  New York City  and Long Island
sold gas Nov. 15, the highest level since the storm hit.  Regular gasoline on Long Island averaged about $4.18 a
gallon, up 26.16 cents since Nov. 2, Lundberg said.  Total U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  fell 440,000 barrels to
201.9 million in the week ended Nov. 9 after four consecutive
weekly increases, Energy Department data show. On the East
Coast, supplies dropped 1.54 million barrels to 45.1 million, a
four-year low.  Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged $3.81 a gallon,
down 20 cents, Lundberg said.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
markets surveyed was in  Long Island , Lundberg said. The lowest
price was in  Memphis , where customers paid an average of $3.04 a
gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
