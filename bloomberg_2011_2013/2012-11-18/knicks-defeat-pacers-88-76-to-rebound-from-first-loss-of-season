Carmelo Anthony scored 26 points and
the host  New York  Knicks bounced back from their first loss of
the season to defeat the Indiana Pacers 88-76 today.  The Knicks (7-1), who had their perfect start to the season
ended two days ago with a loss at Memphis, took an 11-point
halftime lead and kept a double-digit margin for most of the
second half of the National Basketball Association game.  Paul George  had 20 points to lead Indiana (4-7), which lost
its sixth straight road game.  The Knicks have won all four of their games at Madison
Square Garden this season by 10 or more points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
