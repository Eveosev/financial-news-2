U.S. President  Barack Obama  said
tomorrow’s visit to Myanmar is an acknowledgment of the
country’s political reform efforts.  “There is an articulated commitment to further political
reform,” Obama said at a press briefing in Bangkok. “But I
don’t think anyone is under any illusion that Burma has arrived
and that they are where they need to be,” he said, referring to
the country by its former name. “The country has a long way to
go.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
