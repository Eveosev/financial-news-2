The  National Hockey League  and its
players’ association will resume negotiations aimed at reaching
a new collective bargaining agreement after a one-week hiatus.  “We have tentatively agreed to get back together on
Monday, either late in the afternoon or early evening,” NHL
Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said on the  league’s website .
“The meeting was requested by the Union and it’s their agenda.
We will see what they have to tell us.”  The NHL and the NHLPA last met on Nov. 11.  NHL teams have been locked out since Sept. 16, the day
after the old labor contract expired. The NHL has canceled a
total of 327 regular-season games, including all games through
Nov. 30 and the annual Winter Classic scheduled for Jan. 1. The
regular season was supposed to begin Oct. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
