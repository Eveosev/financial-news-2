Saudi Arabia ’s crude oil exports
rose in September to 7.28 million barrels a day as local
refineries cut processing by 14.6 percent, according to the
Joint Organizations Data Initiative.  The world’s largest crude exporter shipped 2.9 percent more
crude while producing 0.3 percent less oil than it did in
August, according to data posted today on JODI’s website. Saudi
Arabia  pumped  9.72 million barrels of crude a day in September,
the data showed.  Refineries in the kingdom processed 1.68 million barrels a
day, down by 287,000 barrels a day from August, JODI said,
citing statistics the Saudi government submitted to the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in OPEC, stored 269.3
million barrels of crude within its borders in September, up
from 269.1 million a month earlier, the data show. The country,
which burns crude to produce electricity and desalinate water,
is seeking increasingly to use natural gas as a substitute fuel.
By doing do, the government plans to free up more crude for sale
overseas, where the commodity can sell at higher prices than it
does at home.  JODI, supervised by the Riyadh-based International Energy
Forum, uses statistics supplied by national governments to
compile data on production, imports and exports for oil-
producing and consuming nations. The data include crude oil and
condensates and exclude natural gas liquids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
