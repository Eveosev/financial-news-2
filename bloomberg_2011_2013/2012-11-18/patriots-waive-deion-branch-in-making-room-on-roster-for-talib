 The New England Patriots waived
wide receiver Deion Branch, who was the Most Valuable Player of
their most recent Super Bowl win in 2005, and activated
recently-acquired cornerback Aqib Talib.   Branch re-signed with the Patriots on Sept. 19 and had nine
catches for 80 yards in seven games this season. He had a
season-high four receptions for 30 yards in last week’s win over
Buffalo, yet suffered a hamstring injury this week.   Talib joined the Patriots in a Nov. 1 trade with Tampa Bay
and the former first-round draft pick is eligible to return this
week after completing a four-game suspension for violating the
National Football League’s drug policy.    The Patriots, who also signed receiver Greg Salas from
their practice squad and released defensive back Malcolm
Williams, host the Indianapolis Colts tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
