The U.S. Defense Department’s
“failure to sufficiently defend”  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s F-35
Joint Strike Fighter is leading to calls in Congress to curtail
the program, according to Republican Senator  John Cornyn  of
Texas.  Cornyn, in a letter today to the Pentagon’s acquisition
chief, Ashton Carter, who has been nominated to become Deputy
Secretary of Defense, asks for his “personal commitment” to
the success of the $382 billion program -- the Pentagon’s
largest.  “I write to express disappointment with your apparent lack
of commitment to the success” of the F-35, said Cornyn, a
member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which must
approve Carter’s nomination. “I strongly encourage you to step
up defense of this key program.”  Congress will return to Washington next month. A 12-member
congressional committee has been charged with finding $1.5
trillion in budget savings.  The F-35 is built in Cornyn’s state. He and other lawmakers
will be using their leverage to protect federal spending in
their states.  “I am concerned that the DoD’s failure to sufficiently
defend and advocate for the F-35 program has enabled and even
invited unwarranted criticisms from many corners, including
partial or complete cancellation of the program,” Cornyn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
