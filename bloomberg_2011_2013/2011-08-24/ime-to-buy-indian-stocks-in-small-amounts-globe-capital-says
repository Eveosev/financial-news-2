Avinash Gupta, vice president of
equity research at Globe Capital Market Ltd, comments on the
outlook for the Indian stock market. Gupta spoke by phone from
 New Delhi .  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose
156.77 points, or 1 percent, to 16,498.47 yesterday. The
National Stock Exchange S&P CNX Nifty Index gained 1 percent to
4,948.90.  On markets:  “The market is having a technical bounce-back. Some sort
of short-term investment is going on in the market. We expect
markets to rally to 5,000 to 5,200. If a long-term investor
wants to buy good stocks, this is a good time to start
accumulating them. The market is weak and it could go down
further. If you want to buy, then buy in small amounts. If the
market goes down further, buy further. But if it turns around,
it will be a different ball game altogether.”  On  interest rates :  “The  Reserve Bank  of  India  is not going to ease the
situation till the time inflation comes down. In the short-term,
we’re not seeing any easing of interest rates.”  On the anti-corruption movement:  “The impact is at present very minimal. It is beneficial
for the market in the long-run. If there is no corruption, it
will increase valuations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
