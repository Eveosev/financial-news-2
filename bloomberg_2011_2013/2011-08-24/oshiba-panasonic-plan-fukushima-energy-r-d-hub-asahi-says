Toshiba Corp. (6502)  and  Panasonic Corp. (6752) 
are considering a research and development hub for renewable
energy and agriculture in Fukushima, the Asahi newspaper
 reported  today.  About 20 companies have shown interest in joining the R&D
hub project to be set up in two towns, Shimogo and Nishigo, west
of the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, the paper said
citing consulting company  A.T. Kearney .  The project is intended to help develop new industries and
create jobs, it said. The two towns plan to apply for the
government’s “special zone for reconstruction” to receive tax
break by as early as the end of the year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
