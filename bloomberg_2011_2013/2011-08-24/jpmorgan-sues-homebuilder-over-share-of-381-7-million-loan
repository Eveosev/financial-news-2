JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , leader of a
group of lenders owed $381.7 million on a bankrupt homebuilding
project in Henderson, Nevada, sued  Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH)  to
recover the builder’s share of a guarantee.  JPMorgan and other lenders agreed in 2004 to advance as
much as $535 million to builders including Meritage and  Beazer
Homes USA Inc. (BZH) , taking repayment guarantees from each builder,
according to a complaint filed yesterday in Las Vegas. The share
of Meritage for the loans advanced to date is $13.3 million,
JPMorgan said in the filing as it asked a judge to compel
payment.  “JPMorgan has made due demand under the repayment
guaranty, and the defendants have failed and refused to pay
their liabilities,” the bank said.  South Edge LLC, which is owned by the builders, is in
 bankruptcy court  in Nevada. The bankruptcy triggered the
repayment guarantee, JPMorgan said.  Meritage sued the bank Aug. 19 in state court in Ohio,
where the JPMorgan unit that is the trustee for the lenders is
based. Meritage asked a judge to rule the homebuilder doesn’t
have any obligations to the lenders and seeks $8 million in
damages.  Meritage claims that it tried to pay the lenders in April
2008 but JPMorgan refused to accept the payment.  Meritage’s claim for damages is based on losses related to
the drop in value of the property and legal fees, company Chief
Financial Officer Larry W. Seay said today in a telephone
interview.  The case is JPMorgan v. Meritage Homes, 11-cv-01364, U.S.
District Court, District of Nevada ( Las Vegas ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
