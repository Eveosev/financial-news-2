CME Group Inc. raised the margin
requirements on gold trading at its Comex unit for the second
time this month, after prices surged to a record above $1,900 an
ounce and then plunged today by the most since March 2008.  The minimum cash deposit for borrowing from brokers to
trade gold futures will rise 27 percent to $9,450 per 100-ounce
contract in the speculative Tier 1 category at the close of
trading tomorrow, Chicago-based CME said in a  statement . On Aug.
11, the increase by the exchange was 22 percent to $7,425. The
cost of one contract after today’s close was $175,730. The
maintenance margin will rise to $7,000 from $5,500.  Comex is making it more expensive for speculators to trade
the metal as open interest for gold options climbed to a record
1.263 million contracts on Aug. 18 and prices slumped more than
7 percent in two days, erasing the gain of the past two weeks
that sent the metal to a record $1,917.90 yesterday.  “It will add selling pressure, even after today,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services said in
a telephone interview from  Chicago . “This is the exchange
reacting to the volatility.”  The CME last raised margins on Aug. 11, when prices fell
1.8 percent, the biggest slump since June 23.  Today, gold futures for December delivery plunged $104, or
5.6 percent, to settle at $1,757.30, the biggest decline for a
most-active contract since March 19, 2008.  Historical Volatility  The 10-day historical volatility for gold jumped to 39.9
percent, the highest since March 2009, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “There will be a short-term impact on  gold prices ,”
Savneet Singh, the chief executive officer of  New-York  based
Gold Bullion International, said in a telephone interview. “The
long-term fundamentals are intact.”  The precious metal has surged 24 percent in 2011, gaining
for an 11th year, as the sovereign-debt crisis and a faltering
economy boost demand for the metal as a protection of wealth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
