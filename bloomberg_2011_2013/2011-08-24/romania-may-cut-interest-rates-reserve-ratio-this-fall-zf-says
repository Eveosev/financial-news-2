Romanian inflation holding below 5
percent through September would allow the central bank to cut
its main interest rate and minimum  reserve requirements  for leu
deposits this autumn, Ziarul Financiar reported today, citing an
unidentified person in banking.  Romanian policy makers may switch to an easing bias after
keeping rates unchanged for more than a year to boost leu-
currency lending and spur economic growth on slowing inflation,
the Bucharest-based  newspaper said , citing the person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
