Kenyan coffee prices increased 2.9
percent at an auction yesterday compared with a week earlier
after supplies dropped, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The average price for all coffee sold climbed to $331.01
for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, from $321.57 a week earlier,
the exchange said in an e-mailed statement today from the
capital, Nairobi. The benchmark AA grade rose 1.9 percent to an
average of $500.09 a bag after supplies fell 6.8 percent to 627
bags, it said.  “There is a tightness in supply with reports that there is
little coffee in the market,” Mansukh Shah, a coffee trader at
the Nairobi-based Alanwood Ltd., said by phone. “Global prices
have improved.”  Total coffee supplies at the auction declined 6.8 percent
to 16,724 bags and sales dropped 1.2 percent to 11,441 bags,
according to the exchange. Kenya harvests the bulk of its crop
from October through December, while a secondary crop is reaped
from April to June.  The following are details of yesterday’s auction in U.S.
