Nigeria ’s naira appreciated the most
in two months as two people familiar with the transaction said
the central bank sold dollars after the African country’s
currency fell to the lowest level in more than four weeks.  The currency of sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest economy
appreciated by 1.1 percent against the dollar to 154.25 at 5:15
p.m. in Lagos, its biggest gain on a closing basis since June
27, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The naira dropped
as much as 0.3 percent to 156.43 yesterday, the weakest level
since July 26, before ending the day little changed.  The central bank sold an unspecified amount of dollars,
according to Usman Onoja, chief executive officer of Lagos-based
Lovonus Trust and Investment Ltd., which trades the naira. A
trader at another bank also said the central bank sold the
currency. He asked not to be identified because the transaction
had not been made public.  Central bank spokesman Mohammed Abdullahi didn’t answer his
telephone following calls seeking comment by Bloomberg.  Today’s advance left the currency 0.4 percent weaker since
the central bank said it removed a $1 million cap on the amount
of foreign exchange that bureaus may buy from lenders per week
on Aug. 19. The currency has declined 1.4 percent against the
dollar this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
