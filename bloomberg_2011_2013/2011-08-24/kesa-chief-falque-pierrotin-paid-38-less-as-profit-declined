Kesa Electricals Plc (KESA)  Chief Executive
Officer Thierry Falque-Pierrotin received 38 percent less in
remuneration in the fiscal year through April as retail profit
slumped 2.7 percent and sales declined at its U.K. chain Comet.  Falque-Pierrotin, 51, who was appointed CEO in January
2009, was paid 1.46 million euros ($2.1 million), compared with
2.38 million euros a year earlier, according to  Kesa’s  annual
report. He didn’t receive any shares under the performance share
plan or deferred annual bonus. The CEO was granted 747,400
shares as part of the long-term incentive plan based on earnings
per share and free  cash flow .  Kesa is considering an exit of its Comet chain after retail
profit fell to 107 million euros last fiscal year, from 110
million euros a year earlier. Comet posted a full-year retail
loss of 8.9 million pounds ($14.7 million) compared with profit
of 11.5 million pounds a year earlier, while Kesa’s Darty France
unit reported a 12 percent gain in retail profit to 149.2
million euros.  Kesa defines retail profit as operating profit excluding
reorganization and one-time financial costs, gains or losses on
acquisition-related options and associates’ share of interest
and taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
