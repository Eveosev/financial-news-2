South Korean consumer confidence
fell to a five-month low as stock market turmoil dented the
outlook and accelerating inflation hurt purchasing power.  The sentiment index fell to 99 in August from 102 in July,
the  Bank of Korea  said in an e-mailed statement today. A reading
below 100 indicates people are more pessimistic than the average
between the first quarter of 1999 and the second quarter of 2008.  The Bank of Korea left  interest rates  unchanged for a
second straight month on Aug. 11 as faltering recoveries in
 Europe  and the U.S. threaten to crimp demand for Asian exports.
At the same time, inflation quickened in July and has exceeded
the monetary authority’s 4 percent limit each month this year.  The expected inflation rate over the next year was 4.2
percent, faster than last month’s 4 percent and the highest
since March 2009, today’s report showed.  A sub-index measuring consumers’ views of the economic
outlook plunged to 77 in August from 88 in the previous month.  The benchmark Kospi stock index has tumbled 18 percent so
far in August. A rout triggered by concern the global recovery
is weakening has wiped about $6 trillion of shares worldwide in
the same period.  The  consumer confidence  index is based on survey responses
from 1,988 households in 56 cities. It was conducted by mail and
telephone between Aug. 11 and Aug. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
