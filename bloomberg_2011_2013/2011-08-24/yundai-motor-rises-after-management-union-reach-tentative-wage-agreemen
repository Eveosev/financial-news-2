Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  rose as much as
6.5 percent in Seoul trading after its management and labor
union reached a tentative wage accord, paving the way for  South
Korea ’s largest automaker to avoid a strike for a third straight
year.  The Seoul-based automaker advanced 1.4 percent to 180,500
won as of the 3 p.m. close. It earlier touched 189,500 won,
taking its two-day intra-day gain to the most since October
2008. The benchmark  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  slipped 1.2 percent.  “It’s definitely positive news,” Kang Sang Min, an
analyst at Hanwha Securities Co., said by phone today. “This
agreement with the union, coupled with a planned release of
August sales next week, will provide a turning point for the
stock, which has been really badly hit recently.”  If the agreement is accepted, Hyundai will avoid a strike
for the third straight year, the first time that has happened
since the union was set up in 1987. Hyundai Motor shares tumbled
31 percent this month through Aug. 22 amid a rout in global
equities.  Workers’ monthly base salary will be increased by 5.4
percent, or 93,000 won ($86), Hyundai and the  union  said in
separate statements today. The two parties also agreed on a
bonus equal to three months’ pay in addition to 7 million won in
cash and a distribution of 35 shares for each worker. The deal
will be put to union members for approval in a vote planned for
Aug. 26.  Affiliate  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) ’s workers approved a wage accord
for 2011 on Aug. 19, averting strikes for a second straight
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
