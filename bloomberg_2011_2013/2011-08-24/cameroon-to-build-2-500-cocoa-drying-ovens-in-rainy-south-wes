Cameroon ,  Africa ’s fourth-biggest
cocoa producer, will construct 2,500 ovens to dry beans in the
South West region, where heavy rains slow down the process, said
James Mosima Lobe, president of the Cameroon National
Association of Cocoa and Coffee Producers.  The ovens will be built in January and February and replace
old ones that have broken down, he said in an interview today in
Yaounde, the capital. About 600,000 cocoa farmers will benefit
and the ovens will be built by the country’s Cocoa and Coffee
Development Fund, Lobe said.  Ivory Coast , Ghana and  Nigeria  are the continent’s top
producers of the chocolate ingredient. Cameroon’s 2010-11
harvest increased to 240,000 metric tons from 198,000 tons a
year earlier, Jean Nkuete, minister of agriculture and rural
development, said Aug. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
