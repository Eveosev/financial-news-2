Cocoa arrivals from Bahia,  Brazil ’s
biggest growing region, slipped 3.8 percent from a week earlier
in line with a seasonal decline, according to analyst  Thomas Hartmann .  Deliveries to shippers and processors totaled 54,056 bags
in the week to Aug. 21, Hartmann wrote in a report yesterday.
That compares with the 56,164 bags he reported a week earlier.
Total arrivals across Brazil were 76,527 bags compared with
80,677 bags a week earlier. A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132
pounds).  Bahia represents almost 80 percent of the country’s output
and 95 percent of grindings, Hartmann said in a Jan. 19 e-mail.
He’s a board member of the Commercial Association of Bahia and
heads the group’s statistical service on Brazilian production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
