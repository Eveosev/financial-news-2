Former University of Tennessee
basketball coach Bruce Pearl was banned from recruiting for
three years at any National Collegiate Athletic Association
school for violations while he was with the Volunteers, the NCAA
said.  Pearl, who was fired at the end of last season, was
suspended for eight games during 2010-11 and forfeited $1.5
million in pay.  The NCAA said Pearl failed to monitor his program and
provided “false and misleading information” during its
investigation into recruiting violations.  The NCAA, college sports governing body, also put the
Knoxville, Tennessee, school on probation for two years.  The violations involved three recruits who attended a
dinner at Pearl’s home during their unofficial visits to the
school. Pearl took the families outside, informed them the visit
was a violation of NCAA rules and asked them not to tell anyone.
Pearl later told NCAA investigators the meeting never happened.  The NCAA investigation also found that the men’s basketball
staff had placed 94 impermissible phone calls to 12 prospects
over two years. Three former assistant coaches also were banned
from recruiting for two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
