U.S. Gulf oil premiums strengthened
after West Texas Intermediate’s discount to Brent widened.  The gap between October contracts gained $1.04 to $24.91 a
barrel at 3:10 p.m. in  New York . The spread settled Aug. 19 at a
record margin of $26.21 a barrel.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet added $2.10 to $25.60 a barrel over
WTI at 2:06 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 75 cents to
$21.55 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added $1.10 to $21.75 while Poseidon strengthened $1.20 to
$21.50 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium increased 25 cents to
$19.50 a barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at 70
cents. Thunder Horse’s premium added 25 cents to $25 above the
benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $14 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The spread for Western Canada Select strengthened $1 to a
discount of $13 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
