Li Ning Co.,  China ’s largest maker
and retailer of sportswear, said its gross and profit margins
may narrow on rising costs and heightening competition.  The clothier founded former Olympic gymnast Li Ning
yesterday said first-half net income plummeted 49 percent to 294
million yuan ($46 million) on sales that fell 4.8 percent to 4.3
billion yuan. Profit margin narrowed to 6.8 percent from 12.9
percent.  The gross margin for the second half of this year will be
lower than in the same period in 2010 and the margin on profit
attributable to equity holders for the full year of 2011 is
expected to decline by about 1 to 2 percentage points, the
company said.  “Rising costs have inflicted far-reaching impacts on the
overall structure of the industry and have had a profound
influence on different segments of the industry value chain,”
Beijing-based  Li Ning  said in the statement. Competition
continues to intensify, it said.  Li Ning fell 3 percent to HK$9 at the 4 p.m. close of
trading in  Hong Kong , before it announced earnings. The stock
has tumbled 45 percent this year.  Escalating costs for raw materials, labor and rents, as
well as higher discounts for distributors, cut Li Ning’s gross
profit margin to 47.3 percent in the first half from 47.9
percent a year earlier, the company said. Operating profit
decreased 46 percent to 442 million yuan from a year earlier.  The company said last month it expected first-half sales to
drop about 5 percent and the margin on profit attributable to
equity holders to shrink to as low as 6 percent on higher costs
and increased competition.  Xtep International Holdings (1368)  Ltd., a Chinese sportswear
maker part-owned by the  Carlyle Group , said last week its first-
half net income climbed 25 percent to 466 million yuan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
