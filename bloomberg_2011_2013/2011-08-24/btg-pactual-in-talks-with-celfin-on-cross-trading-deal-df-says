Brazilian bank Banco BTG Pactual SA
is in talks with Chilean brokerage Celfin Capital SA to

other’s home country through which clients can buy or sell
securities, the Santiago-based newspaper wrote, citing a person
close to the negotiations.  Elisa Perez, head of communications at Celfin Capital, was
not available to comment, an assistant said by phone today. BTG
Pactual doesn’t comment on rumors, said an external
communications firm representing the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
