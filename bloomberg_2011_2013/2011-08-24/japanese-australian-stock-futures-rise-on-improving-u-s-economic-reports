Japanese stocks rose, pushing up the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average the most in almost two months, after
better-than-estimated U.S. economic data improved the earnings
outlook for exporters.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , which gets 28 percent of its sales in
the U.S. and  Canada , rose 1.7 percent after demand for cars
boosted orders for U.S. durable goods the most in four months.
 Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Panasonic Corp. (6752)  and other Japanese technology
companies gained as shares of Apple Inc. dropped in after-hours
trading following  Steve Jobs ’ resignation as the firm’s chief
executive officer.  The Nikkei 225 advanced 1.5 percent to 8,772.36 at the 3
p.m. trading close in Tokyo, its biggest increase since June 29.
The broader Topix index gained 1.3 percent to 751.82, with more
than two stocks rising for each that fell.  “The  U.S. economy  weakened toward spring as people talked
about a soft patch, but we’ve seen good data over the past month
or so,” said Koichi Kurose, chief economist in Tokyo at Resona
Bank Ltd. “There’s no need to be too pessimistic.”  The Topix has lost about 11 percent this month amid concern
U.S. growth is sputtering and  Europe ’s debt crisis will damage
the banking system, damping demand in two of  Japan ’s biggest
export markets. The decline has cut the price of shares on the
index to 0.88 times book value, the lowest since March 2009.  ‘Mood Lift’  The U.S. report on goods meant to last at least three years
contrasted with data this month on jobless claims,  consumer
confidence  and manufacturing that spurred concern the U.S. is
poised for a recession.  “The mood has lifted because U.S. economic reports
released yesterday weren’t as bad as expected and the foreign-
exchange market has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, who
oversees about $600 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management Co.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is scheduled to
speak at a meeting of central bankers in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming 
on Aug. 26, where he is expected to signal new stimulus measures.
Bernanke triggered a 28 percent rally in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index last year at the same conference when he hinted the
Fed would buy more bonds to prop up the economy.  Exporters to the U.S. advanced after the durable orders
report and the yen fell 0.4 percent against the dollar yesterday.
Toyota rose 1.7 percent to 2,764 yen. Nissan Motor Co., which
has lost 18 percent this month, climbed 7 percent to 673 yen.  Jobs’ Resigns  The yen traded at 77.12 per dollar today compared with
76.98 in  New York  yesterday. A weaker yen helps exporters
because it boosts the value of overseas income.  Nasdaq-100 Index futures declined after Jobs’ resignation
was announced. Futures on the index, which gets 66 percent of
its value from computer-related companies such as Apple, fell
0.8 percent to 2,122.75. S&P 500 Index futures pared their loss
to 0.2 percent from 0.6 percent. Apple shares dropped 5.1
percent to $357.10.  Japanese technology companies rose. Sony gained 2.1 percent
to 1,581 yen. Panasonic, an electronics maker which yesterday
dropped to its lowest level since 1980, climbed 3.8 percent to
792 yen.  Nippon Electric Glass Co. rose 6.1 percent to 751 yen.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. boosted its investment rating on the
glassmaker to “buy” from “neutral,” citing an increase in
its market share and improved profit performance.  Hitachi Chemical Co.  climbed 4.4 percent to 1,287 yen
after the maker of chemical products said it will establish a
subsidiary in  India .  To contact the reporters on this story:
