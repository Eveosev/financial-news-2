Barclays Plc (BARC)  sued a U.K. debt
recovery company in a trademark dispute over the use of the name
of the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets.  Barclays Recovery Services has no connection to the London-
based bank, Barclays said in a statement. The lawsuit was filed
in London on Aug. 22.  Under U.K. intellectual property law, company names can be
protected as registered trademarks, according to the
Intellectual Property Office’s website. Infringement may occur
when a logo or name can be confused with a registered trademark,
or where it takes advantage of another company’s reputation.  “The legal proceedings seek to stop Barclays Recovery
Services Ltd. from infringing the bank’s trademarks and engaging
in conduct that is misleading,” Barclays said. “Barclays
values its reputation with its customers and the general public
and will always act to protect its name.”  Barclays Recovery Services, which is registered at an
address on Regent Street in  London , doesn’t have a listed phone
number.  The case is Barclays Bank Plc v. Barclays Recovery Services
Ltd.,  High Court  of Justice Chancery Division, No. HC11C02895.  To contact the reporter on this story:
