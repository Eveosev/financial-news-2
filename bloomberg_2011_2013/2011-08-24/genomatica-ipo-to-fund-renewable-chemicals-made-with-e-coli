Genomatica Inc., which genetically
engineers microorganisms like E. coli to make chemicals used in
spandex and running shoes, applied to raise as much as $100
million through an initial public offering of shares.  Genomatica, based in  San Diego  will be listed on the Nasdaq
Stock Market under the ticker GENO, according to a regulatory
filing. Proceeds would be used for research and development,
capital projects and other purposes.  Genomatica plans to open its first commercial-scale plant
for making butanediol, used in spandex, running-shoe soles and
plastics, with Italian partner Novamont SpA by the end of 2012.
The company engineers E. coli bacteria, among other
microorganisms, to turn sugar from plants such as corn into
chemicals traditionally made from oil and natural gas.  Genomatica also has agreements with  Tate & Lyle Plc (TATE) ,
 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corp. (4188)  and Gruppo Mossi & Ghisolf’s
Chemtex unit to make butanediol in the U.S.,  Europe  and  Asia 
starting in 2014.  Competitors in butanediol include BASF SE, Koch Industries
Inc., LyondellBasell Industries NV, BioAmber Inc., Metabolix
Inc. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the company said.  Genomatica also plans to convert plant sugars into
butadiene, used in synthetic rubber.  The company has raised $84.2 million by issuing convertible
preferred stock and has lost $43.5 million since its founding in
1998. Genomatica has no product sales, with revenue coming from
grants, partnership agreements and software licensing.  Pricing and timing of the IPO weren’t provided in the
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
