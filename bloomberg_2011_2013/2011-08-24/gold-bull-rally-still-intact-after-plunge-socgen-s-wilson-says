Gold’s bull rally is still intact
even after the metal’s drop of as much as 8 percent from a
record set yesterday, said  David Wilson , an analyst at Societe
Generale SA.  Gold futures reached a record $1,917.90 in New York
yesterday before erasing the gain and today slumped as much as
5.2 percent to $1,763.80 as increased orders for U.S. durable
goods eroded demand for the metal as a haven asset.  Wilson spoke by phone today from London.  “Gold typically corrects when it hits psychological
important levels, and my guess is $1,900 is a key level.  ‘‘The uptrend is still very much intact’’ and bullion will
likely reach $2,000 by the end of the year, he said.  Central bankers from around the world gather on Aug. 26 in
 Jackson Hole , Wyoming, for an annual meeting that last year saw
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke hint at a second round
of asset purchases.  ‘‘To a certain extent it’s a wait and see on what happens
on Friday to gain a clear sense of the short-term direction.  ‘‘The bigger macro drivers, which are still debt levels in
the U.S. and  Europe , anemic growth in the U.S. and Europe’’ and
low  interest rates  will support gold, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
