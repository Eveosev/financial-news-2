Private equity investments in Nordic
companies rose in the first half of the year and may surpass the
record 8 billion euros ($11.6 billion) that were invested in
2007,  Argentum Fondsinvesteringer AS  said.  Investors placed 6.6 billion euros in the first half of the
year, compared with the 6.8 billion euros invested in Nordic
companies for all of last year, the Bergen, Norway-based asset
manager said today in a quarterly report. Buyouts drove the
increase as funds invested 6.4 billion euros in companies in
 Sweden ,  Norway ,  Denmark  and  Finland  in the period.  The biggest deal was Bain Capital LLC and Hellman &
Friedman LLCâ€™s 21 billion-krona ($3.3 billion) purchase of
Securitas Direct, a security and alarm company owned by Swedish
private-equity group EQT Partners AB. The number of private
equity funds seeking to cash in on their investments rose to 31
in the quarter from 25 in the first quarter as buyout firms sold
stakes to other managers, Argentum said.  Argentum, which has 6.5 billion kroner under management, is
funded by the Norwegian government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
