Gold’s “correction” was overdue
and the metal may slide below $1,700 an ounce in the next few
days before rebounding, said  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG.  Gold futures reached a record $1,917.90 an ounce in  New
York  yesterday before erasing the gain and today slumped as much
as 5.2 percent to $1,763.80 as increased orders for U.S. durable
goods eroded demand for the metal as a haven asset.  Briesemann spoke today by phone from  Frankfurt .  “I definitely think that a correction was overdue. Maybe
the trigger for the correction was that the gold price yesterday
wasn’t able to maintain the $1,900 mark. This may have triggered
some technical selling and profit-taking.”  Gold may have been pressured by a report showing orders for
U.S. durable goods climbed more than forecast in July and by
advancing U.S. and European equities, he said.  While gold may fall below $1,700 an ounce in the next
couple of days, “the correction should be rather short-lived,”
Briesemann said.  “The recovery is still on a very shaky footing. We see
more downside risks than upside potential for the global
economy. That, in turn, should be quite positive for gold as a
store of value or a safe haven. If the global economy gets even
gloomier and if we get more disappointing data, then we will
test the psychological $2,000 mark” before the end of the year,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
