Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose on
optimism borrowing costs are headed lower. The dong dropped as
the central bank set a lower reference rate.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam aims to lower dong lending rates
to a range of 17 percent to 19 percent starting mid-September
through to the end of 2011, newly appointed Governor Nguyen Van
Binh said this month. Lending rates have exceeded 20 percent
this year. Government notes snapped a two-day drop as official
data released today showed consumer prices rose 0.93 percent
from a month earlier in August after having increased 1.17
percent the prior month.  “Commercial banks are expecting  interest rates  will go
down as the central bank has shown its determination,” said Luu
Hai Yen, a Hanoi-based analyst at Thang Long Securities Joint-
Stock Co. “The slowing of inflation on a monthly basis is also
a signal for banks to reduce lending rates.”  The yield on the nation’s five-year bonds fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.55 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong fell 0.1 percent to 20,831 per dollar as of 3:46
p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The central bank set the currency’s  reference rate  at
20,628 today, from 20,618 yesterday, its website showed. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the official rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Ven Ram, Andrew Janes  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
