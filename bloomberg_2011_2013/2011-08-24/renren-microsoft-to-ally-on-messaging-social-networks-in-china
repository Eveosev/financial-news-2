Renren Inc., the Chinese social
networking site operator that completed an $855 million initial
public offering in May, agreed with  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s MSN to
cooperate on instant messaging services and social networks.  The services will allow users to create universal logins to
both sites and share photos and status updates, the companies
said in a joint statement e-mailed today.  The announcement is at least the second web partnership
announced by Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft in China in the
past two months as it seeks to broaden its access to the world’s
largest Internet market by users. Microsoft and Baidu Inc. last
month agreed to allow Baidu’s users to see English search
results generated by the U.S. company’s Bing technology.  Renren, based in Beijing, had 124.2 million users at the
end of June.  China  had 485 million  Internet users  in the same
period, according to data from the government-sponsored China
Internet Network Information Center.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
