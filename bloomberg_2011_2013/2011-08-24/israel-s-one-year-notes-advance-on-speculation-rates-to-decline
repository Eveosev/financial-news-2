Israel ’s one-year central bank bills
advanced for the first time in three days on speculation the
Bank of Israel may lower  interest rates  this year to bolster the
economy as inflation slows.  The rate on the Makam bills due August 2012 dropped one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.06 percent at the
4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. The yield has retreated 43 basis
points since the notes started trading this month. The shorter-
term maturities are more sensitive to rate fluctuations. One-
year interest-rate swaps, an indicator of investor expectations
for rates in the next 12 months, dropped two basis points to
3.03 percent.  “The yield on the Makam has fallen below the current
interest rate level, which shows that the market is pricing in
the possibility of a rate cut,” said Moshik Yaniv, head of the
local fixed-income desk at Migdal Capital Markets Ltd. in  Tel
Aviv . “Signs of a slowdown in inflation expectations and
concern about a recession in the global economy will keep yields
in a downward direction as the central bank is expected to
reverse its rate policy in the coming months.”  Central bank Governor  Stanley Fischer  will maintain the
benchmark rate at 3.25 percent for a third month at a meeting on
Aug. 29, according to all six economists surveyed this month by
Bloomberg News. Economic growth slowed to an annualized 3.3
Percent in the second quarter from a revised 4.7 percent in the
first quarter, the  Central Bureau of Statistics  said on Aug. 16.  Slowing Inflation  The yield on the 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit bond due January
2020 rose four basis points to 4.67 percent. The rate has
declined 36 basis points this month. The rate on the 5.5 percent
notes maturing in January 2022 gained six basis points to 4.83
percent.  The shekel weakened 0.5 percent to 3.6082 against the
dollar as of 5:43 p.m., taking the decline to 5.2 percent this
month.  Israeli consumers reduced purchases of food and other items
last month amid protests against the higher cost of living. Food
sales at chain stores dropped a seasonally adjusted 6.6 percent
in July from June, the Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau of
Statistics  said Aug. 22.  Consumer prices fell for the first time in more than a year
in July, retreating 0.3 percent from June, the statistics bureau
said Aug. 15. The annual inflation rate slowed to 3.4 percent
from 4.2 percent.  Prices are expected to rise 2.5 percent in the next 12
months, according to the average of forecasters surveyed by the
 Bank of Israel , the central bank said in an e-mailed statement
on Aug. 21.  Breakeven Rate  The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, was little changed at 257.34.  More than 100,000 Israelis have joined a Facebook group
calling for a boycott of cottage cheese to protest its rising
price, prompting dairy companies to lower the cost and the
government to set up a committee to examine food prices.  The two-year breakeven rate, which reflects market
expectations for inflation over the time period, fell to 210,
implying an average annual inflation rate of 2.10 percent. The
yield on the CPI-linked bond due in June 2013 dropped three
basis points to 0.954 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
