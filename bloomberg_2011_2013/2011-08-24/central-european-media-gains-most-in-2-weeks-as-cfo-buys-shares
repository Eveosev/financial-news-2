Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV)  rose the most in two weeks after the television broadcaster
said Chief Financial Officer David Sach bought company shares.  CME, as the Bermuda-based company part-owned by Time Warner
Inc. is known, rose as much as 5.5 percent, its biggest intraday
advance since Aug. 10. It traded 4.1 percent up at 210.3 koruna
as of 1:25 p.m. in Prague, snapping a four-day decline.  Sach bought 20,000 shares at $12 apiece on Aug. 19, CME
said in a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission yesterday after the Czech equity market
closed. The companyâ€™s U.S.-traded shares climbed 6.2 percent to
$12.39 in New York after the announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
