Japanese stocks rose for a second
day after weaker-than-estimated U.S. economic data reinforced
optimism Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will act to
support growth.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Japan’s largest carmaker, rose 0.3
percent.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s No. 1 energy explorer, advanced
2.2 percent after oil prices rose. A measure of banks in the
Topix index was little changed after Moody’s Investors Service
cut Japan’s sovereign-credit rating, citing “weak” prospects
for cutting the country’s debt burden.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 0.7 percent to 8,792.03
as of 9:21 a.m. in Tokyo. The broader Topix index climbed 0.7
percent to 755.88.  “The market has priced in a slowdown in the  U.S. economy 
to a good degree, and that’s why a series of weak U.S. economic
reports tend to raise expectations that Bernanke will do
something, rather than damping the market,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist at Tachibana Securities
Co. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
