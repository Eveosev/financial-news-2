German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  wants to empower the European Financial Stability
Facility to act largely without parliamentary control,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing a draft framework contract.  The German parliament would only vote on the master
contract and thereafter partly lose its budget authority, the
newspaper said. The use of the fund would also not be tied to
fiscal and economic conditions anymore, according to the report.  The EFSF, which is planned to be expanded to almost 780
billion euros ($1.12 trillion) from 440 billion euros, could
grant precautionary credits and recapitalize banks through
credits to governments, Handelsblatt said. Countries under
pressure from financial markets could get precautionary stand-by
credit lines, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
