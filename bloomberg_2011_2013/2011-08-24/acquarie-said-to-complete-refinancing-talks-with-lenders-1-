Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) ,  Australia â€™s
biggest investment bank, completed talks with lenders to
refinance part of a A$9 billion ($9.4 billion) debt facility
signed in 2007, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The Sydney-based bank raised about A$2 billion in new loans
from domestic and Asian banks, the person said, asking not to be
named as the details are private. The borrowings include 3 1/2-
year debt paying a margin of about 170 basis points more than
the bank bill swap rate, and five-year loans with about a 190
basis-point margin, the person said.  About A$4.5 billion of the facility signed in November 2007
is outstanding, the person said. Half is due in November, while
the rest matures a year later, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Navleen Prasad, a Sydney-based spokeswoman for Macquarie,
declined to comment on the refinancing.  The loans were used to set up Macquarie Group as a new
holding company in a reorganization of Macquarie Bank Ltd.
Eleven banks arranged the facility and 44 lenders contributed,
Macquarie said at the time.  Macquarie is paying interest of 55 basis points more than
the bank bill swap rate on the loan due in 2011, and 60 basis
points on the 2012 borrowing, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
