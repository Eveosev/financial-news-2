Malawiâ€™s tobacco earnings declined
57 percent from the start of the selling season to Aug. 22
compared with a year earlier, the Guardian reported, citing
Tobacco Control Commission chief executive officer, Bruce 
Munthali.  The southern African nation has earned $151.4 million from
130 million kilograms (286 million pounds) of tobacco sold, the
Blantyre-based newspaper cited Munthali as saying. This compared
with $352.9 million from 176.8 million kilograms for the same
period in 2010, it said.  The selling season started on March 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
