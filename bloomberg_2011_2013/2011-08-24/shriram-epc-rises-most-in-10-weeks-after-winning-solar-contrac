Shriram EPC Ltd. (SEPC) , a developer of
renewable-energy projects in  India , rose the most in 10 weeks in
Mumbai trading after winning an order to build one of the
country’s first solar thermal power plants.  Shriram EPC climbed as much as 15 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since June 16, and traded up 6.6 percent at 129.3
rupees as of 12:01 p.m. local time. The benchmark Sensitive
Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange fell 0.8 percent.  The Chennai-based company, whose Orient Green Power Co.
unit develops wind farms and biomass plants, won a 6.4 billion-
rupee ($140 million) contract from Abhijeet Projects Ltd. to
build a 50-megawatt solar project in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan state,
it said in a filing to the Bombay exchange.  The project is one of 37 awarded in India’s first solar
auction to build 620 megawatts of capacity by 2013. Companies
including billionaire Anil Ambani’s  Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR)  and
 Lanco Infratech Ltd. (LANCI)  are responsible for putting up 75 percent
of that capacity using solar thermal technology, which harnesses
the sun to heat liquids that produce steam for generators.  Shriram EPC will design, engineer, supply and construct the
project within 20 months using technology from Jerusalem-based
 Ener-t International Ltd. , it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
