Canadian natural gas for September
delivery fell amid forecasts of mild weather in the U.S. Midwest
that threatens to cut demand for power-plant fuels to run air-
conditioners.  Heating requirements in  Chicago  will trail normal by 11
percent for the next week, according to Belton, Missouri-based
forecaster Weather Derivatives. The Midwest is the biggest
consuming region for  Canada ’s gas exports.  “The North has cooled off even though it’s still fairly
hot across the South,” said  Martin King , senior commodities
analyst at FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary.  Alberta  gas for September fell 6 cents, or 1.7 percent, to
C$3.405 per gigajoule ($3.27 per million British thermal units)
as of 3:15 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian
Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users
in Canada and the U.S., and is priced on TransCanada Corp.’s
Alberta system.  Gas for September delivery on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange slipped 7.1 cents, or 1.8 percent, to settle at $3.922
per million Btu.  Gas for prompt delivery gained as warm weather today
boosted air conditioner use. Chicago was forecast to reach a
high of 93 degrees Fahrenheit (34 Celsius), 11 more than normal,
before cooling to 80 tomorrow, Accuweather Inc. said  Spot Prices  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
rose 8.06 cents, or 2 percent, to $4.1698 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from
western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas was up 9.13 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $3.907,
according to ICE. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas rose 8.82 cents to $3.9862.  Volume on  TransCanada’s  Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.8 billion cubic
feet as of 1:30 p.m. in New York, 19 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.9 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.94 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.23 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.53 billion cubic feet today, about 55
percent of its capacity of 2.76 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.7
billion cubic feet at 1:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
