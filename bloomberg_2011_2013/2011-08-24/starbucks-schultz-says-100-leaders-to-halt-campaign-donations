Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  Chief Executive
Officer  Howard Schultz  said more than 100 business leaders have
joined his pledge to boycott U.S. political campaign donations.  AOL Inc. (AOL)  CEO Tim Armstrong, J.C. Penney Co. CEO Myron Ullman, Whole Foods Market Inc. Co-CEO Walter Robb and others
have agreed to accelerate hiring and halt campaign giving to
incumbents in  Washington  until Congress finds a solution to the
nation’s growing debt, Starbucks said in an e-mailed statement.  Schultz is taking his campaign to the Internet and to
Facebook today with the creation of Upward Spiral, “a platform
for action inspired by the letter to America from Howard
Schultz,” according to the  website .  Last week, Schultz, 58, sent an e-mail to fellow CEOs and
business leaders urging them to boycott donating to political
campaigns. The Starbucks head has previously addressed issues
including the high price of coffee, which he says is fueled by
market speculation.  Seattle-based Starbucks has spent $350,000 lobbying the
U.S. government this year, according to OpenSecrets.org. Schultz
donated to Senator  Maria Cantwell , a Washington state Democrat,
in March, data from the research organization show.  Schultz joined the company about three decades ago and
later served as CEO until 2000. He became CEO again in 2008 amid
declining sales after Starbucks opened cafes too quickly.  Starbucks is the largest coffee-shop operator with more
than 17,000 locations worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
