BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,  Australia ’s
largest oil and gas producer, said full-year petroleum earnings
rose 38 percent, driven by higher prices and the fourth
consecutive increase in annual output.  The oil and gas unit’s underlying earnings before interest
and tax were $6.33 billion in the 12 months ended June 30,
compared with $4.57 billion a year earlier, the Melbourne-based
company said today in a statement. That compares with a Credit
Suisse Group AG estimate of $6.26 billion.  Petroleum Chief Executive Officer, J. Michael Yeager, has
led a drive into U.S. shale gas this year, agreeing to buy
Petrohawk Energy Corp. for about $12.1 billion and paying $4.75
billion for assets from Chesapeake Energy Corp. Full-year oil
and gas sales climbed 22 percent to $10.74 billion.  “The growth potential of the petroleum business has been
significantly enhanced by the acquisition of onshore U.S. shale
gas resources,” BHP said in the statement.  Full-year petroleum output increased to 159.4 million
barrels of oil equivalent from 158.6 million barrels a year ago,
helped by the purchase of Chesapeake’s Fayetteville shale
assets, the company said last month.  The company reiterated in July that it expects oil and gas
production to decline in the 2012 financial year, excluding the
Chesapeake acquisition, as permitting delays in the U.S. Gulf of
 Mexico  following the disaster at BP Plc’s Macondo well disrupt
the drilling of production wells.  To contact the reporter on this story:
