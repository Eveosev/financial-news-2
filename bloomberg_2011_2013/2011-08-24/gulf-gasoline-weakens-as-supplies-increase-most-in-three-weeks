Gulf Coast  gasoline slumped after
government data showed stockpiles of the fuel in the region
increased the most in three weeks.  Total gasoline inventories in the Gulf Coast rose 1.9
million barrels to 74.1 million barrels last week, the highest
level since Feb. 25, according to Energy Department data.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast widened 1.25 cents to 6.38 cents at 11:50 a.m. versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose 0.61 cent to
$2.8315 a gallon.  Colonial Pipeline Co. resumed operations on its lines 3 and
4, which carry oil products from Greensboro, North Carolina, to
areas including New York Harbor, after inspections showed a 5.8-
magnitude earthquake didn’t damage the system,  Steve Baker , a
company spokesman, said in e-mail.  Main lines 1 and 2, connecting Houston to Greensboro, were
cleared and restarted earlier yesterday after inspections.  The discount for the same gasoline in New York Harbor
narrowed 0.13 cent to 2.25 cents.  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  is operating one of the crude units at its
Philadelphia refinery at reduced rates after a “small” fire
early today, Thomas Golembeski, a company spokesman, said in an
e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
