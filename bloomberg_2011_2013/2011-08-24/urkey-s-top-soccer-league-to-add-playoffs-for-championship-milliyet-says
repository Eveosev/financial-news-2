Turkey ’s top soccer league will
determine its champion with play-offs beginning with the
upcoming 2011-2012 season, Milliyet reported, citing Besiktas
Chairman Yildirim Demiroren.  The Turkish Football Federation had decided to implement
play-offs and clubs participating in the league agreed to it,
Demiroren said on behalf of all the teams, according to
Istanbul-based Milliyet.  The clubs also discussed extending subscription-based
television channel Digiturk’s five-year broadcasting rights by
another three years, Milliyet said, citing Demiroren. Teams will
decide on the matter after receiving an opinion from the
competition watchdog, according to Milliyet.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
