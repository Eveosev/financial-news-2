The cost to hire capesize vessels
that haul  iron ore  and coal climbed for an 11th consecutive day
to the highest level this year as increased shipments pushed
earnings for some cargoes over $40,000 a day.  Average daily capesize rents rose 5.6 percent to $19,010,
the most since Dec. 24 and more than double levels at the start
of the month, according to the London-based Baltic Exchange,
which tracks freight costs on 29 dry-cargo routes.  The Baltic Dry Index, a broader measure of commodity costs,
gained 2.4 percent to 1,602 points.  Rents for the ships that account for 40 percent of dry-bulk
fleet capacity have rallied this month as higher commodity
exports helped relieve a vessel glut. The surplus caused average
rents to plunge to the lowest level since 2002 over the year’s
first two quarters.  Trading in forward freight agreements, used to bet on or
hedge the cost of shipping dry-bulk commodities by sea, suggest
rates may be peaking, Frode Morkedal, an analyst at Oslo-based
RS Platou Markets AS, wrote in an e-mailed report.  October-to-December capesize contracts were trading lower
for the first time in 12 sessions, after gaining 16 percent over
the last week, according to data compiled by Clarkson Securities
Ltd., the freight derivatives unit of the world’s largest
shipbroker.  The contract was trading at $14,575 a day by 3:47 p.m. in
 London , down from yesterday’s closing price of $14,700 a day.  “The paper market is yet to signal the sustainability of
this rally and questions remain on its strength,” Morkedal
said.  Mining Company Cargoes  Still, voyages for capesize vessels booked for loading from
ports in the Atlantic region may have secured rates equating to
$43,500 daily, the Baltic Exchange said in a daily report to
members yesterday.  Cargoes from mining companies are increasing because iron
ore produced in  China  costs more for the first time this year
than imports of the steelmaking raw material from Australia and
China, Omar Notka, an analyst with Dahlman Rose & Co. in  New
York , said Aug. 17. He forecast rents will rise as high as
$33,000 daily.  The cost to hire panamax vessels, the largest to transit
the Panama Canal, gained 0.9 percent to $13,281, according to
the  Baltic Exchange . Supramax vessels, about 25 percent smaller,
were up 0.7 percent to $14,412 a day. Daily rates for handysize
ships, the smallest tracked by the gauge, rose 0.7 percent to
$9,765.  To contact the reporter on this story:
