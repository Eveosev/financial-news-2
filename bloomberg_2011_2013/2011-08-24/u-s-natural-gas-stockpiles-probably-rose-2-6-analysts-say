U.S. natural-gas supplies probably
rose by more than the seasonal average last week as moderating
temperatures reduce electricity demand, according to analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories gained 74 billion cubic feet, or 2.6 percent,
to 2.907 trillion cubic feet in the week ended Aug. 19, based on
the median of 12 estimates. The five-year average stockpile
change for the week is an increase of 55 billion, according to
Energy Department data. Supplies rose 38 billion a year earlier.  Temperatures were normal in most of the eastern U.S. and
northern Midwest last week, according to Commodity Weather Group
in Bethesda, Maryland. The high in  New York  on Aug. 18 was 83
degrees Fahrenheit (28 Celsius), matching the normal temperature
for the day, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,
Pennsylvania.  “The cooler temperatures are likely to result in some
reduced gas demand,” said Jason Schenker, the president of
Prestige Economics in Austin,  Texas . “We still have robust
supplies, especially in the Marcellus Shale region in the
eastern U.S.”  The stockpile estimates ranged from increases of 61 billion
to 80 billion cubic feet. The Energy Department’s weekly supply
report is scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in
 Washington .  Power plants  use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, according to department data.  Gas storage levels increased 50 billion cubic feet to 2.833
trillion in the week ended Aug. 12, the department reported last
week. Stockpiles were 2.5 percent below the five-year average
and 5.8 percent below year-earlier levels.  Natural gas for September delivery fell 4.7 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $3.94 per million British thermal units
last week on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices today fell
4.4 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $3.949 as of 11:07 a.m. on the
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
