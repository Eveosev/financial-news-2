The Treasury’s $35 billion sale of
five-year notes may draw a record low auction yield of 1.021
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 10 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in August 2016, yielded 1.020
percent in pre-auction trading, which would be the lowest in
Bloomberg data beginning in 1994. The record low auction yield
of 1.260 percent was set in September 2010. Bids are due by 1
p.m. New York time.  Today’s offering is the same size as the past 11 monthly
five-year debt auctions. The last sale of the maturity, on July
27, drew a yield of 1.580 percent, down from 1.615 percent in
the previous month.  The July sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.62,
lower than the average for the past 10 offerings of 2.77.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 36.6 percent of the notes at the July
sale, less than the 10-sale average of 39 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealers that place their bids
directly with the Treasury, bought 14.6 percent of the
securities at last month’s offering. That compares with an
average of 10.7 percent at the past 10 sales.  Five-year notes have returned 2.1 percent in August, the
most since a 2.4 percent gain at the depths of the financial
crisis in December 2008, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes.  Today’s auction is the second of three note sales totaling
$99 billion this week. Yesterday’s $35 billion auction of
two-year debt produced a record low yield of 0.222 percent. The
U.S. will auction $29 billion of seven-year securities tomorrow.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in U.S. debt
auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
