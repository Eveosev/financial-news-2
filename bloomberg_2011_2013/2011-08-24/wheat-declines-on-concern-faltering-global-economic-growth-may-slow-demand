Wheat fell in  Chicago  after three
days of gains as  Egypt , the world’s biggest importer of the
grain, shunned U.S. and European Union crops in favor of less
expensive Russian supplies.  Egypt bought 180,000 metric tons of Russian milling wheat
at a tender yesterday for prices from $284.17 to $290 a ton,
said Nomani Nomani, vice chairman of the state-run  General
Authority  for Supply Commodities. A ban on all cereal exports
from  Russia  expired July 1 as scheduled.  “Russian grain is still relatively cheap and convenient,
but there is political determination not to rely too heavily”
on imports from the country, said Justine White, an analyst at
VM Group in London.  Wheat for December delivery dropped 5.25 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $7.7925 a bushel by 11:39 a.m.  London  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Milling wheat for November delivery
traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris fell 1 euro, or 0.5 percent, to
206.75 euros ($298.88) a ton.  Russia barred exports last year after the nation’s worst
drought in a half-century cut production, causing the wheat
harvest to plunge 37 percent from 2009. Egypt also has purchased
Romanian wheat since the ban ended.  “This disruption in supply hit Egypt very hard,” White
said. “I think they are likely to diversify their sources after
that experience.”  Corn, Soybeans  Corn for December delivery declined 2.75 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $7.4075 a bushel in Chicago. Soybeans for November
delivery slid 2.75 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $13.945 a bushel.  Prices also slipped as German business confidence fell more
than estimated by analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. “Weak”
prospects for economic growth in  Japan , the top global corn
importer, caused Moody’s Investors Service to cut the country’s
debt rating. Futures indicated U.S. equity benchmarks will
retreat when trading starts in  New York .  “The weakness seen this morning is not due to any change
in the fundamental outlook, which remains strong, but likely a
result of pressure from continuing weakness in external
markets,” White said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
