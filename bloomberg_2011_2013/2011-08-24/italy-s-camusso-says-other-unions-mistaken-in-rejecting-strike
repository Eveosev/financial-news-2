Susanna Camusso, leader of  Italy ’s
biggest union, said a general strike she called for Sept. 6 is
the only way to get the government to change its 45.5 billion-
euro ($66 billion) austerity plan and said the country’s other
unions are “making a mistake” by not participating.  Italy’s two other main union federations, the CISL and UIL,
have rejected the CGIL’s calls and deemed the strike
irresponsible.  They “are making a mistake and they are under the
government’s spell,” Camusso said today at a press conference
in  Rome . “The government is irresponsible, not the strike.”  Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  proposed the austerity
package on Aug. 6, in a move to get the  European Central Bank  to
buy its bonds and help lower the country’s surging borrowing
costs. The plan seeks to balance the budget in 2013 by cutting
central and regional government spending and imposing a
“solidarity tax” on people earning more than 90,000 euros.  Under Camusso’s alternative plan, the government’s bonus
tax on high earners would be replaced with a proportional levy
on all incomes for a year. The CGIL plan would also introduce a
 wealth tax  and a one-off levy on real-estate holdings, both
starting from a value of 800,000 euros.  The briefing took place opposite the Senate in Rome, where
lawmakers are reviewing the package, which still needs to be
approved by parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
