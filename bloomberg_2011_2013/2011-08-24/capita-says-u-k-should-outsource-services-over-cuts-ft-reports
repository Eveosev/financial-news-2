Capita Group Plc’s Chief Executive
Officer Paul Pindar said the government should make spending
cuts in administration and processing functions rather than in
public services, the Financial Times reported, citing an
interview. Pindar said just 10 percent of the U.K.’s 468 local
authorities were outsourcing significantly and there is room for
expansion, according to the FT.  Capita is bidding for a record 4.7 billion pounds ($7.8
billion) of contracts after it won twice as much work in the
first half of this year than it did the year before, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
