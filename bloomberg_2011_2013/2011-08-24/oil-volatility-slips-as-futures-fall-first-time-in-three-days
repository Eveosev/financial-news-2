Crude oil options volatility slipped
as the underlying futures dropped for the first time in three
days in  New York  after the dollar increased and gold plummeted
the most in more than two years, curbing investor interest in
raw materials.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
October, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 42.4 percent at 3 p.m. in New York,
down from 42.8 percent yesterday. Options volatility was 37.5
percent a week ago.  Oil for October delivery fell 28 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
settle at $85.16 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices have fallen 6.8 percent this year.  The most active contract in electronic trading today was
October $80 puts, with 3,244 lots changing hands as of 4:20
p.m.. The options dropped 5 cents to $1.92 a barrel. October $75
puts, the next-most active option, lost 4 cents to 98 cents with
2,683 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Seven of the most-active options today were puts, with
strike prices ranging from $50 to $85 a barrel. There were 2.5
puts traded for each call in electronic trading on the Nymex.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
