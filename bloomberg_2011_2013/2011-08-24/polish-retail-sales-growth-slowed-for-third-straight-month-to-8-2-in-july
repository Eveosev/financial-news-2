Polish retail-sales growth slowed
for a third month in July as consumers deferred purchases,
missing analyst forecasts and suggesting the economy may be
weakening in the second half of 2011.  Sales increased 8.2 percent from a year earlier, compared
with 10.9 percent the previous month, the  Central Statistical
Office  in Warsaw said today. The median estimate of 18
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 10.1 percent. Sales rose
0.7 percent from June.  Consumer demand, typically lower during the summer-holiday
season, was suppressed further by signs of slower economic
growth. Investor confidence in  Germany ,  Poland ’s main trading
partner, fell to the lowest in 2 ½ years in August, the ZEW
Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim said
yesterday.  “Consumers aren’t in a shopping mood,” said Wojciech Matysiak, an economist at Bank Pekao SA. “They are increasingly
concerned about jobs as economic prospects worsen, savings are
eaten away by declines on capital markets and the expensive
Swiss franc threatens the ability to repay mortgages.”  Gross domestic product grew 4.2 percent in the second
quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey, slower than the
previous quarter’s 4.4 percent expansion. The initial GDP
estimate is scheduled for release Aug. 30.  Slower Growth  Matysiak expects the economy to grow 4 percent during 2011,
with retail sales to slow further and new manufacturing orders
to weaken.  New orders fell 0.6 percent from a year earlier in July
after growing 10.8 percent in June, while fixed investments grew
9 percent on the year in the January-June period, the statistics
office said.  Unemployment, which was 11.5 percent a year ago, declined
to 11.7 percent in July from 11.8 percent in June, the office
said. Corporate employment increased 3.3 percent from a year
earlier during the month, the slowest pace this year.  The zloty traded at 4.1544 per euro at 11:30 a.m. in
Warsaw, up from 4.1537 late yesterday. It traded at 3.6394 to
the Swiss franc after falling to record 4.0393 earlier this
month, boosting the combined debt of 700,000 Poles with franc-
denominated mortgages and consumer loans by 13 billion zloty
($4.52 billion), according to the Polish Debt Registry data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
