Harmony Gold Mining Co.,  Africa ’s
third-largest producer of the precious metal, is targeting a 19
percent increase in output this fiscal year after prices surged.  Harmony is seeking to produce 1.45 million ounces to 1.55
million ounces in the year through June 2012 and as much as 1.7
million ounces the following year, Chief Executive Officer
Graham Briggs said today. Harmony plans to produce 2 million
ounces in fiscal 2015, rather than in 2013 as previously
estimated, it said in a webcast presentation.  Gold has soared 30 percent this year, touching a record
$1,913.50 an ounce yesterday on concern the global economic
recovery is stalling. It will probably average $2,275 an ounce
next year, Societe Generale SA said in a report this month.
Harmony missed last year’s production forecast.  “We’re really focused on achieving these targets,” Briggs
told investors. “We need to get production up and that will
bring the rand-per-kilogram costs down.”  Safety stoppages and “under-performance” at some shafts
cut output to 1.3 million ounces in the year through June, 9
percent lower than a year earlier and missing a target of as
much as 1.5 million ounces. Fifteen workers died in Harmony’s
mines in the period.  Harmony’s rand-per-kilogram costs will probably be “fairly
flat” in fiscal 2012, Briggs said in an interview in
Johannesburg today. Costs on that basis rose 16 percent to
226,667 rand ($31,337) in fiscal 2011.  Shares Slide  Harmony fell 2.9 percent to 90.18 rand at the 5 p.m. close
in Johannesburg, trimming its gain this year to 8.7 percent.
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , Africa’s largest gold producer, has
fallen 4.6 percent in the period, while  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) , the
second biggest, dropped 5.6 percent.  Gold futures for December delivery plunged $76.10, or 4.1
percent, to $1,785.20 an ounce at 10:58 a.m. on the Comex in  New
York  amid speculation that financial markets may be stabilizing.
A close at that level would be the biggest loss since Feb. 4,
2010.  Briggs has shut unprofitable shafts and cut staff in  South
Africa , where electricity and labor costs are rising faster than
inflation. Harmony, based in Johannesburg, is expanding in  Papua
New Guinea  to reduce exposure to South Africa, where it has 90
percent of its gold resources.  The company values the Wafi-Golpu gold-copper mine, a
venture with  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM)  in Papua New Guinea, at $6
billion to $8 billion, Briggs said, adding that it has potential
to grow “much bigger.” A pre-feasibility study may be
completed in the first half of 2012, he said.  Mineral Ownership  Harmony isn’t “hugely concerned” about a proposal in the
country to transfer mineral ownership from the state to
landowners, according to the CEO. It doesn’t appear to be a
“widely supported concept,” he said.  Wafi Golpu could add as much as 400,000 ounces of gold and
250,000 metric tons of copper a year to Harmony’s production.
The mine could start output in fiscal 2017.  Harmony could start uranium production from material at its
Tshepong, Phakisa and Masimong mines in 2014, Briggs said. A
decision on the project, which could cost less than 1.7 billion
rand, will probably be made between October and January, he
said. It targets 850,000 pounds a year.  Harmony is also studying a 315 million-rand expansion at
its Joel mine to extend its life by eight years and a 152
million-rand project at Evander to extract gold from material
that’s already been processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
