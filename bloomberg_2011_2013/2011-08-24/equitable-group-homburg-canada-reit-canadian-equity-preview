Canadian stocks rose for a third
day, led by banks, as U.S. durable-goods orders doubled the
median economist forecast.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s largest lender by
assets, advanced 2.4 percent after the U.S. Commerce Department
said bookings for goods meant to last at least three years
increased 4 percent last month.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s
biggest gold producer, declined 3.7 percent as the metal’s
futures sank the most since March 2008.  Encana Corp. (ECA) ,  Canada ’s
largest natural gas producer, climbed 2.5 percent as energy
stocks rose.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index gained 5.48
points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,343.81.  “There seems to be a little bit of a pause on the panic of
investors,” Tony Demarin, chief investment officer at BCV Asset
Management in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said in a telephone interview.
BCV oversees C$300 million ($304 million). “Durable goods are
another reason why the risk trade can be considered to be back
on a bit.”  The index’s 4.7 percent retreat this month through
yesterday was the second-smallest among major developed-market
stock benchmarks behind  New Zealand ’s. A 10 percent jump in
S&P/TSX gold stocks mostly canceled out the impact of a 9.9
percent plunge in energy-company shares as precious metals rose
on concern that the global recovery is slowing.  Economists had forecast a 2 percent increase in U.S.
durable-goods orders, according to the median of 81 estimates in
a Bloomberg survey.  Royal Bank, TD  Bank stocks gained 1.8 percent after surging 3.8 percent

to C$75.07.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , the country’s third-biggest
lender by assets, climbed 1.7 percent to C$52.32.  Gold futures plunged $104 an ounce, or 5.6 percent. The
futures had settled at a record $1,891.90 an ounce on Aug. 22.  Barrick declined 3.7 percent to C$48.25.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the
world’s second-largest gold producer by market value, lost 4
percent to C$48.76.  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW) , Canada’s fourth-biggest precious-
metals company by market value, decreased 4.4 percent to C$36.67
as silver slumped 7.4 percent.  Tahoe Resources Inc. (THO) , which
explores for silver in  Guatemala , tumbled 12 percent, the most
since it began trading in June 2010, to C$16.95.  Energy  S&P/TSX energy stocks rose to add to yesterday’s 3.9
percent gain.  Encana advanced 2.5 percent to C$24.89.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ,
Canada’s largest pipeline company, increased 1.5 percent to
C$31.99.  Tourmaline Oil Corp. (TOU) , which produces natural gas and
oil in western Canada, rallied 4.9 percent to C$32.05.
 PetroBakken Energy Ltd. (PBN) , another western Canadian oil and gas
company, jumped 6.2 percent to C$11.15 after CNBC discussed the
Bakken oil formation.  West Fraser Timber Co., Canada’s largest forestry company,
climbed 5.9 percent to C$42.29 after the U.S. reported the
biggest monthly increase in  home prices  since 2005.  Sino-Forest

of financial manipulation, rose 13 percent to C$5.10 after

to C$28.25. The company will release smartphones that can run
programs built for Google Inc.’s Android operation system next
year, according to three people familiar with the plan. The
people declined to be identified because the plans aren’t
public.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s biggest
fertilizer producer by market value, advanced 1.7 percent to
C$54.70 as dry weather persisted in the U.S. Midwest. If drought
continues into September and October, wheat prices may jump 50
percent, Dan Manternach, a wheat economist at Doane Advisory
Services in  St. Louis , said in a telephone interview.  Viterra Inc. (VT) , Canada’s largest grain handler, increased 5.3
percent to C$10.49.  To contact the reporter on this story:
