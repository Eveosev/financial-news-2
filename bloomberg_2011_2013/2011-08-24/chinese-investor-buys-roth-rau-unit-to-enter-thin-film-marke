Roth & Rau AG (R8R) , the German maker of
solar-panel manufacturing equipment, sold its thin-film unit to
a Chinese investor that plans to enter the market “on a large
scale.”  Roth & Rau sold its CTF Solar GmbH unit, which specializes
in systems for producing cadmium telluride-based thin-film solar
modules, to an unnamed Chinese investor for less than 10 million
euros ($14.4 million), Vice President of Sales and Marketing
Silvia Roth said today in a telephone interview.  The investor also purchased a coating system and plans to
buy four more of them after completing a pilot project, said
Roth. The system has annual production capacity of 80 megawatts
and is key to making this type of thin-film module. Roth & Rau
has accepted a 357 million-euro ($515 million) takeover bid from
Swiss rival Meyer Burger Technology AG.  The investor, which isn’t an established solar company,
“plans to produce thin-film modules on a large scale in  China 
starting in 2013,” Roth said.  The sale of CTF, which Roth & Rau acquired in 2009, is part
of a shift away from offering complete production systems to
selling individual machines, the company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
