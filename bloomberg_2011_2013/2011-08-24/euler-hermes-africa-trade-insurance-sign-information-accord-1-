Euler Hermes Kreditversicherungs AG,
the German credit insurer owned by  Allianz SE (ALV) , signed an accord
with the  African Trade Insurance Agency  to share information,
ATI Chief Executive Officer George Otieno said.  The two agencies will begin by doing joint business in
Ghana, Otieno said yesterday in an interview in Nairobi,  Kenya ’s
capital.  “We are coming together for 10 member states and we are
moving on to 15 this time next year,” Otieno said.  ATI, part of the  African Union , was created in 2001 by the
 Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa , the continent’s
biggest trading bloc, to promote trade and investment by
providing political and credit-risk insurance.  Last year Euler Hermes provided credit worth 1 billion
euros ($1.4 billion) for exports to sub-Saharan  Africa , Managing
Director Andreas Klasen said yesterday.  “What we want to do is increase business opportunities for
German companies,” Klasen said. “In the first six months of
this year were have covered around 500 million euros, new cover
for sub-Saharan Africa.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
