The leases of 14 Borders Group Inc.
superstores and specialty stores will be acquired by Books-A-
Million Inc. for $934,209, according to court documents.  Borders and Books-A-Million reached agreement for the lease
sale, which includes a payment of $750,000 plus $184,209 in
“cure” costs for landlords, according to the filing yesterday
in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan. The agreement has a
condition that it must be approved by the bankruptcy court by
Aug. 29, according to the filing. A deal for Books-A-Million to
buy 30 Borders locations fell through last month.  The store locations in the lease agreement include
Portland, Maine; Canton, Ohio; Concord,  New Hampshire ; and Mays
Landing,  New Jersey .  “Debtors, after consulting with their professional
advisers, believe that the consideration offered as part of the
BAM transaction for the BAM leases is greater than the debtors
would receive if they sold each individual lease pursuant to the
auction process approved by the bankruptcy court,” Borders
lawyers said in the filing.  Books-A-Million said on July 26 that it ended a bid to buy
30 locations after the companies failed to agree on terms and
going-out-of-business sales at the locations.  Borders on July 21 won bankruptcy court approval to
liquidate its remaining 399 stores.  Books-A-Million, which also runs stores under the names
Books & Co., Bookland and Joe Muggs Newsstands, is based in
Birmingham,  Alabama , and operates 230 stores.  The case is In re Borders Group Inc., 11-10614, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
