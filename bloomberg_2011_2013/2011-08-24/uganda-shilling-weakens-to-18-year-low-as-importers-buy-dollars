Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency this year, weakened for a third day to
an 18-year low against the dollar as oil and telecommunication
companies bought dollars to prepare for next month’s orders.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
depreciated as much as 0.8 percent to 2,818.50, the weakest
intraday level since June 1993, before trading 0.7 percent lower
at 2,815.02 per dollar as of 2:40 p.m. in the capital, Kampala,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There was a big corporate in the market buying dollars,
and the demand is mainly by oil and telecommunication
companies,” Lucas Ochieng, a currency trader at Orient Bank
Ltd. in Kampala, said by phone. Companies need dollars to place
orders for equipment and supplies next month, he said.  “The central bank intervened in the market easing pressure
on the shilling,” he said.  Stephen Kaboyo, the central bank’s director of financial
markets, wasn’t able to comment when Bloomberg contacted him by
phone today.  The shilling slumped 18 percent this year, the biggest
decline among more than 170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg, as
inflation accelerated. A surge in food and fuel prices pushed
inflation to a more than 18-year high of 18.7 percent in July
from 15.7 percent in June.  Uganda is on the cusp of an oil boom with Tullow Oil Plc, a
U.K. explorer with the most licenses in Africa, expected to
start pumping crude and gas from the Lake Albert Basin in 2012.
The country has an estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil, with
about 1 billion barrels in proven reserves, according to Tullow.  Tullow said today it may invest at least $4 billion with
its partners to develop  oil fields  off  Ghana ’s Atlantic coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
