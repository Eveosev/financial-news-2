Banco Finandina SA, a Colombian
lender, will offer as much as 100 billion pesos ($56 million) of
bonds in the local market tomorrow.  The Bogota-based bank will offer 60 billion pesos of the
securities, and make an additional 40 billion pesos available if
there is sufficient demand, it said in a statement published
today in  La Republica  daily. The bank had initially planned to
sell as much as 80 billion pesos of debt, according to a  report 
published yesterday by brokerage Interbolsa SA, which is helping
manage the sale.  Banco Finandina will auction 24- and 36-month securities to
yield as much as 2.1 and 2.5 percentage points above the IBR
interbank rate, according to the offer. The lender will also
sell 60-month debt to yield up to 4.4 percentage points above
inflation, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
