Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, dismissed speculation it’s considering a
merger with smaller rival  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  as “baseless”
in a memo to employees.  “Some blogs are speculating about rumors of merger talks
with J.P. Morgan Chase, which are baseless and don’t even make
practical sense,” the bank’s communications department said in
a memo to employees yesterday that was obtained by Bloomberg.
Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman at Bank of America, confirmed the
contents of the memo.  The memo also rebutted a blog’s suggestion that Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America needs to raise as much as
$200 billion as “just wrong.”  “We have a clear path to meet the new regulatory
requirements under Basel III and we intend to meet these
standards without having to issue additional common stock,”
according to the memo.  JPMorgan, based in  New York , is the second-biggest U.S. 
bank by assets.   To contact the reporters on this story:
