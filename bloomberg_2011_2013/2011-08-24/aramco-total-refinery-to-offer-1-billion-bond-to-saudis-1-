Saudi Aramco Total Refining &
Petrochemical Co., a joint venture oil refinery complex between
Saudi Aramco and  Total SA (FP)  also known as Satorp, will sell $1
billion of Islamic bonds to Saudi investors next month.  The sale will start Sept. 10 and be open for 16 working
days, it said in a  statement  on its website. Satorp will meet
with potential investors on Sept. 13. Deutsche Bank AG, Saudi
Fransi Capital and  Samba Financial Group (SAMBA)  were hired to manage
the sale, the company confirmed.  The offering is limited to Saudi nationals, and those with
a permanent establishment in the kingdom holding a commercial
registration number issued by the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry, the statement said.  The bond will help finance Satorpâ€™s 400,000 barrel-a-day
refinery and petrochemicals complex, which is being built in
Jubail on the Persian Gulf coast of  Saudi Arabia . It is due to
start operations in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
