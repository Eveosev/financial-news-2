Drivers will account for a greater
share of Americans traveling around the Labor Day holiday as a
faltering economic recovery crimps travel plans.  Travel by automobile will rise to 27.3 million travelers
from 27.2 million a year ago as vacationers stay closer to home.
Automobile travel will account for 87 percent of all travel, up
from 84 percent last year.  The number of Americans traveling 50 miles or more from
will fall 2.4 percent to 31.5 million from 32.3 million last
year, according to a forecast by the  American Automobile
Association , the biggest U.S. motoring organization. That’s the
second decline in three years. This year the long weekend runs
from Sept. 1 to Sept. 5.  “Some of the economic momentum seen earlier in the year
has begun to slow and we expect that the result of that will be
a decrease in holiday travelers,” Heathrow, Florida-based AAA
said in a statement.  The U.S. cost of living rose in July by the most in four

routes.  The Bloomberg Comfort Index slumped in August to the
weakest since March 2009. The index measures consumer’s views on
the economy, personal finances and buying climate.  Retail gasoline demand, on a four-week average, has trailed
year-earlier levels for the past 22 weeks, according to
MasterCard Inc.’s SpendingPulse report on Aug. 23. For the four
weeks ended Aug. 19, demand was down 3.8 percent from a year
earlier.  Regular gasoline at the pump was $3.572 as of Aug. 22, 32
percent above a year earlier, according to data on AAA’s
website. The price reached $3.985 on May 4, the highest level

608 miles, down from 635 a year earlier, while spending will
rise to $702 from $697 per trip, AAA said, based on the median
estimate.  A survey of intended travelers found that 71 percent said
that higher prices at the pump wouldn’t affect travel plans.  The projections by AAA are based on research and forecasts
from IHS Global Insight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
