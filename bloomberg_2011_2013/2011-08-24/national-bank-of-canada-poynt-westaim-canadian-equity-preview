Canadian stocks fell for the first
time in four days, led by financial companies and energy
producers, after the U.S. reported an increase in initial
jobless claims and European equities plunged.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Canada ’s largest oil and gas producer,
dropped 2.4 percent.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s largest
lender by assets, lost 1 percent as financial shares slid.
 Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest gold producer, increased
2.3 percent as companies in the industry rebounded after sinking
7.2 percent in the previous two days.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index slipped 59.5
points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,284.31 after gaining 0.3 percent
earlier on speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will signal new
measures to stimulate the economy at a symposium in  Jackson
Hole ,  Wyoming , tomorrow.  “A lot of hopes had been put into tomorrow’s Jackson Hole
meeting,” Luciano Orengo, a  money manager  at  Manulife Financial
Corp. (MFC)  in Toronto, said in a telephone interview. Orengo oversees
C$1.6 billion ($1.6 billion). “People are coming to the
realization that nothing of substance is going to come out
tomorrow.”  The S&P/TSX slipped 4.7 percent this month through
yesterday, the second-least among major developed-market stock
benchmarks behind  New Zealand ’s, as gold rallied to a record
while oil futures sank 11 percent. Gold tumbled 5.6 percent
yesterday, the most since March 2008, after the U.S. reported a
bigger increase in durable-goods orders than most economists had
forecast.  Jobless Claims  Last week, 417,000 Americans filed for first-time
unemployment claims, the Labor Department said today in
 Washington . The figure exceeded all 46 forecasts in a Bloomberg
survey of economists.  Energy companies fell as European equity markets tumbled on
concern the region’s debt crisis is worsening.  Suncor dropped 2.4 percent to C$29.54.  Encana Corp. (ECA) , the
country’s largest natural gas producer, declined 3.6 percent to
C$23.99.  Niko Resources Ltd. (NKO) , an oil and gas producer with
operations in  South Asia , sank 5.4 percent to C$53.31, the
lowest since March 2009, after reporting a quarterly loss.  Athabasca Oil Sands Corp. (ATH) , PetroChina Co.’s partner in oil-
sands development, surged 4.6 percent to C$12.90 after the
 Washington Post  said the U.S. State Department will take a step
toward approving a proposed TransCanada Corp. pipeline to the
 Gulf Coast  as early as tomorrow. The newspaper cited unnamed
sources familiar with the process.  Financials Retreat  The S&P/TSX Financials Index decreased after jumping the
most since July 2009 in the previous two days.  Royal Bank retreated 1 percent to C$50.76. Manulife,  North
America ’s fourth-biggest insurer, slipped 3.2 percent to
C$12.80.  National Bank of Canada (NA) , the country’s sixth-biggest
lender, fell 2.7 percent to C$70.40 after reporting third-
quarter revenue that trailed the average analyst estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  Precious-metals producers advanced as silver gained and
gold rebounded from a two-week intraday low.  Barrick increased 2.3 percent to C$49.37.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) ,
the world’s second-largest gold producer by market value,
climbed 2.7 percent to C$50.06. China Gold International
Resources Corp. rallied 6 percent to C$4.42 after reporting a
fivefold resources increase at its Jiama copper and gold mine in
 Tibet .  Electronic-products maker  5N Plus Inc. (VNP)  jumped 14 percent,
the most since January 2009, to C$8.15. The company reported
fourth-quarter profit that beat the average of four analyst
estimates by 48 percent, excluding certain items.  To contact the reporter on this story:
