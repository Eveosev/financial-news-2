The U.S. Defense Department is
examining whether the country will lift restrictions on the sale
of military technology to  Vietnam , Senator  Jim Webb  said at a
press conference in Hanoi today.  The department and Vietnam’s Ministry of Defense have had
“careful but positive” discussions on the issue, he said. The
U.S. currently  bans the sale  of lethal weapons to Vietnam under
an arms embargo in place since 1984.  The move would further enhance the military relationship
between the U.S. and Vietnam amid escalating spats with  China 
over energy resources in the South China Sea. Vietnam said this
month it’s weighing whether to host a U.S. Navy medical center
in a sign of warming ties between the former enemies.  Vietnam and the U.S. held non-combat exercises in Danang
last month, building upon a series of military exchanges since
2003, when the first U.S. warship docked in the country since
the end of the Vietnam war.  Vietnam received a second Russian-made warship last month,
state-run newspaper Thanh Nien  reported  yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
