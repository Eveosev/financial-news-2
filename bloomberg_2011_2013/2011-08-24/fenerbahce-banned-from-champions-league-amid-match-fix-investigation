Turkey ’s soccer federation barred
Fenerbahce from playing in  Europe ’s elite  Champions League  this 
season as the club is involved in a police investigation into 
alleged match-fixing.  The federation made the decision after European soccer body
UEFA said it might take disciplinary action against the entire
Turkish league if Fenerbahce didn’t withdraw from the
competition, according to a  statement  on the Istanbul-based
federation’s website.  “Bearing in mind the sanctions that might be faced by our
country, Fenerbahce has been ruled ineligible to compete in this
season’s UEFA Champions League,” the statement said.  The decision came less than 24 hours before tomorrow’s
Champions League group draw in  Monaco . UEFA’s emergency panel
selected Turkish club Trabzonspor to replace Fenerbahce in the
draw, the governing body said on its  website .  In a  statement  on its website, Turkish league champion
Fenerbahce called the federation’s decision “a clear violation
of the law that negates decisions the federation has taken
itself.”  The federation last week ruled that it wouldn’t take action
on the match-fixing investigation until prosecutors released a
full charge sheet and details of the evidence they’ve gathered.  Trabzonspor finished second to Fenerbahce in the Turkish
league last season. Its inclusion in the Champions League means
its qualifier in the second-tier Europa League tomorrow against
 Athletic Bilbao  has been canceled, with the Spanish club
automatically progressing to the group stage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
