South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus said  monetary policy  isn’t the main lever to
influence growth in the economy and that often the bank is
assumed to have powers beyond its capabilities, the Financial
Mail reported, citing Marcus.  Microeconomic policies are needed to improve the economy’s
potential growth rate and the current level of  interest rates 
aren’t an obstable to faster  job creation , the Johannesburg-
based weekly magazine quoted Marcus as saying. The governor said
the core function of the central bank is to curb inflation,
disagreeing with some views that the bank hasn’t raised interest
rates yet for fear of being criticized, the Financial Mail said.  Marcus said it’s not possible to manage the rand in a
systemic or sustained way by intervening in the foreign  currency
market , the magazine reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
