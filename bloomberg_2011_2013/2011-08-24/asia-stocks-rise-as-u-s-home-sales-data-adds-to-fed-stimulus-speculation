Asian stocks dropped amid concern
central bankers meeting in Jackson Hole,  Wyoming , will fail to
announce new plans to keep the global economy from slowing and
as companies across the region reported mixed profit results.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank 1.2 percent to 119.34 as
of 7:46 p.m. in  Tokyo , after climbing by the most in five months
yesterday and gaining as much as 0.7 percent today. China Life
Insurance Co. and  Malaysian Airline System Bhd. (MAS)  led declines
after posting lower earnings. Australian companies Suncorp Group
Ltd. and  WorleyParsons Ltd. (WOR)  reported profits that exceeded
analyst estimates.  “It’s risk-off at the moment,” said Khiem Do, the Hong
Kong-based head of multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset
Management, which oversees about $10 billion. “People are
having second thoughts about  Jackson Hole ’s outcome. I’ve seen
some people suggesting the outcome may not be as good as the
market was expecting, so they’re putting on some short skin.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.8 percent
after the U.S. equity benchmark rose by the most in almost two
weeks yesterday amid speculation a slowing economy will force
the  Federal Reserve  to boost stimulus efforts. Government data
yesterday that showed U.S. home sales in July fell to the lowest
level in five months added to evidence the recovery is
faltering. A report on durable goods orders today is expected to
show a decline.  Fed Support  “No doubt the Fed will signal that it remains ready to do
whatever it can to support growth,” said  Stephen Halmarick ,
Sydney-based head of investment markets research at Colonial
First State Global Asset Management, which oversees about $150
billion. “But stock markets will remain volatile because it
remains clear that the pace of growth in the developed world is
slowing significantly.”  Hong Kong ’s HSI Volatility Index and South Korea’s Kospi
200 Volatility Index of option prices are trading about 60
percent above their 90-day moving average levels.  China  Life Insurance, mainland China’s biggest insurer,
sank 12 percent in Hong Kong after reporting first-half profit
fell 28 percent. Malaysian Airline fell 4.9 percent after
posting a second quarterly loss.  Suncorp Group, an Australian lender and insurer, advanced
5.6 percent in Sydney after full-year profit fell less than
analysts’ estimates. WorleyParsons, a provider of engineering
services to the oil and gas industry, jumped 10 percent after
reporting full-year profit that exceeded analyst estimates.  Japan  Rating Cut  Of the 585 companies in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
reported net income since July 11, 45 percent exceeded analyst
estimates, while 33 percent fell short, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average dropped 1.1 percent after
swinging between gains and losses as Moody’s Investors Service
cut the country’s credit rating and Finance Minister  Yoshihiko
Noda  failed to announce measures to stem the yen’s advance to
record levels.  Japanese exporters, whose earnings are hurt by a stronger
currency because it reduces the value of overseas sales,
declined.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker,
dropped 1.6 percent to 2,718 yen, after rising as much as 1.5
percent.  Sony Corp. (6758) , the maker of Bravia Televisions and
PlayStation game consoles, declined 2.9 percent to 1,549 yen.  “Stocks have risen on expectations of Fed action, but it’s
not as though there’s been an improvement in the fundamentals,”
said Toshiaki Iwasaki, an analyst at Mito Securities Co.
“People are covering shorts but beyond that there’s not much
buying because there’s so much uncertainty about the global
economic outlook.”  Banks Drop  The nation’s lenders also dropped after Moody’s reduced
their credit ratings on concern weaker public finances will
reduce the government’s ability to support the banks in times of
crisis.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest
publicly traded lender, fell 2.9 percent to 332 yen. Smaller
rival  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)  lost 1.8 percent to
2,170 yen.  South Korea’s Kospi Index retreated 1.2 percent. Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 2.1 percent, while China’s Shanghai
Composite Index lost 0.5 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
slipped 0.1 percent, erasing gains of as much as 1.6 percent.  China Life tumbled 12 percent to HK$20.30 in Hong Kong, the
most since October 2008. The insurance company said first-half
net income dropped 28 percent from a year earlier to 12.96
billion yuan ($2 billion) as declines in the nation’s stock
market hurt investment returns. Ping An Insurance Group Co., the
country’s second-biggest insurer, retreated 3.7 percent to
HK$62.45.  Malaysian Airline fell 4.9 percent to 1.56 ringgit in  Kuala
Lumpur . The company posted a second consecutive quarterly loss
in the three months ended in June as higher fuel costs eroded
gains from carrying more passengers.  Price Ratios  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 12 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 7.6 percent drop by the  S&P
500  and an 18 percent decline by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.1 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 11.6 times for the S&P 500
and 9.4 times for the Stoxx 600.  Suncorp Group advanced 5.6 percent to A$7.59 in Sydney. The
company said full-year net income slumped 42 percent from a year
earlier to A$453 million ($476 million). Claims increased
following floods in Queensland and earthquakes in New Zealand.
Still, the earnings beat the average estimate of A$400.9 million
by nine analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  WorleyParsons surged 10 percent to A$26.07 after posting a
full-year net income of A$364.2 million, exceeding the average
estimate of A$297.8 million by six analysts compiled by
Bloomberg.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company,
closed unchanged at A$38.21 in Sydney, erasing losses of as much
as 0.9 percent earlier. The company reported just before the
market closed that full-year net income rose to a record of
$23.6 billion, from $12.7 billion a year earlier, as copper,
iron ore and coal prices reached all-time highs because of
demand from China. That beat the $22.6 billion mean of 18
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
