Starwin Products Ltd. (SPL) , a Ghanaian
drugmaker, expects to increase revenue by at least 28 percent
this year as operations start at a new factory for syrup-based
products and sales begin in  Sierra Leone , said Managing Director
Kwasi Yirenkyi.  The Accra-based company, which makes pharmaceutical
products including pain relievers and antibiotics, will start
operations through an agency in Sierra Leone next month, he said
in an interview yesterday on the sidelines of Starwin’s annual
general meeting.  “Exports to  Sierra Leone  should account for 10 percent of
total revenue this year,” Yirenkyi said. Starwin’s net income
for the six months through June soared to 136,445 cedis
($89,530) from 42,347 cedis a year earlier as revenue grew 19
percent to 1.9 million cedis, it said in an Aug. 3 statement to
the Ghana Stock Exchange.  A new plant for syrup-based medication, built at a cost of
more than 100,000 cedis, started operations in May and will
increase output of the liquids fourfold, Yirenkyi said.  “Our resolve is to improve margins and profitability,” he
said. Starwin has developed new products including an appetite
stimulant, pain reliever in blister packaging and an antacid, he
said.  Starwin’s shares were unchanged at 4 pesewas at 11:34 a.m.
in Accra.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
