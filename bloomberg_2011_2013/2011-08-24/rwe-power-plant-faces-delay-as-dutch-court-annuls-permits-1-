RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany ’s second-largest
utility, faces delays to a planned coal-fired power station in
the Netherlands after a court overturned permission to build the
plant in the northern port of Eemshaven.  The Dutch Council of State in  The Hague  annulled permits
granted by the government because an assessment of the potential
effects on nearby nature reserves was incomplete, the court said
today in a website  statement . An appeal isn’t possible, it said.  The national government and the provinces of Groningen and
Friesland granted the permits in 2008 to Essent NV, the Dutch
utility bought by Essen-based RWE the following year. The 1,600-
megawatt plant was scheduled to be completed in 2013, according
to Essent’s website.  “We are very disappointed that after a lengthy and
intensive process, there is still no final certainty about the
completion of the most important energy project in the
Netherlands,” the company said on its website today.  “With the ruling, a large number of studies that are part
of the permit have been accepted. On a number of points though,
more clarity is needed. We are studying how to provide that.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
