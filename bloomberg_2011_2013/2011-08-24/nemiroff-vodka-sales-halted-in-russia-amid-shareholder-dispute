A conflict between shareholders of
Nemiroff, a Ukrainian vodka maker that supplies alcoholic
beverages to 72 countries, halted sales in  Russia , said
Alexander Glus, one of Nemiroff’s owners.  The conflict stalled work of Nemiroff’s Moscow office and
Russian consumers haven’t received vodka supplies since Aug. 19,
Glus told journalists in Moscow today. Glus is chairman of the
board and the biggest single shareholder with a blocking stake
of 25 percent plus two shares.  Nemiroff produced 8.3 million decaliters of alcoholic
beverages last year, according to the company’s website. Russia
accounts for about 35 percent of the sales volume, Glus said.  The conflict erupted this year when some of company’s
shareholders disagreed with the price offered for their stakes
and refused to sign a contract after three years of talks with
billionaire Roustam Tariko’s Russian Standard Vodka, Glus said.
The Russian vodka producer planned to buy 100 percent of
Nemiroff for about $350 million, according to Glus.  Glus said he will either try to buy his partners’ stakes on
borrowed funds to further develop the company and sell to an
investor in several years, or will sell his own stake to
partners at the market price. At present, the shareholders
cannot agree on a price in their talks, according to Glus.  Other Nemiroff owners were not immediately available to
comment after Bloomberg made several calls to company offices in
 Ukraine . The press service of Russian Standard Vodka declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
