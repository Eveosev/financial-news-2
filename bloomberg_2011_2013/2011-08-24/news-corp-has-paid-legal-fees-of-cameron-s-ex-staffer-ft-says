Legal fees incurred by  Andy Coulson ,
the former Sunday newspaper editor who was communications chief
for U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron until January this year,
have been paid to date by  News Corp ., the Financial Times
reported, without saying how it obtained the information.  Coulson, who was arrested last month in the course of a
police inquiry into phone-hacking at News Corp.’s now-defunct
News of the World, is being represented by the law firm DLA
Piper LLP, the newspaper said.  Cameron has said that, with hindsight, it was a mistake to
bring Coulson into his team in 2007, a few months after the
journalist resigned as News of the World editor following the
jailing of one of his reporters for hacking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
