TiVo Inc. (TIVO) , the digital-video
recording pioneer, reported a smaller second-quarter loss than
analysts anticipated, helped by a net increase in cable and
satellite subscribers.  The net loss widened to $19.6 million, or 17 cents a share,
from a loss of $15.3 million, or 13 cents, a year earlier,
Alviso, California-based TiVo said today in a statement.
Analysts had projected a 20-cent loss, the average of eight
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  TiVo enrolled 10,000 new cable and satellite customers,
compared with a loss of 77,000 subscribers a year earlier. The
company posted its first gain in cable and satellite customers
in years, Chief Executive Officer Tom Rogers said in an
interview, without being more specific.  “We’re just seeing the very tip of the iceberg,” Rogers
said.  TiVo rose 57 cents, or 7 percent, in extending trading to
$8.69. The shares fell 13 cents to $8.12 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. They had declined 4.4 percent
this year before today.  Revenue rose 19 percent to $61.2 million in the period
ended July 31 from $51.6 million. Analysts had estimated $54.3
million on average.  Cable operators around the world are licensing TiVo
technology in a rush to deliver to customers set-top boxes that
can connect to the Internet. Virgin Media Inc. added more than
50,000 TiVo subscribers in the U.K. in the quarter.  TiVo has begun manufacturing high-definition boxes for
satellite provider DirecTV, which could accelerate TiVo’s
customer acquisition rate by the end of the year, Rogers said.  Total Subscribers Fall  The number of people who pay TiVo directly for service fell
by 43,000 to 1.17 million.  During the quarter, TiVo reached a $500 million settlement
of its seven-year-old patent infringement lawsuit with Dish
Network Corp. and EchoStar Corp.  TiVo is also pressing patent infringement lawsuits against
AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. A federal judge in
 Texas  is expected to issue a ruling by late September that may
indicate a likely outcome for the cases before trial.  To contact the reporter on this story:
