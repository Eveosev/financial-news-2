Global mergers and acquisitions in
the information technology and communications industries grew 19
percent in the first eight months of the year to $323 billion,
 Financial Times Deutschland  said, citing data by market
researcher Dealogic Holdings Plc.  The amount was close to the level of the $339 billion
reached in 2008, the newspaper said. Companies agreed to deals
faster than before the crisis because their cash reserves are
higher and mobile telephone and cloud computing markets are
undergoing rapid changes, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
