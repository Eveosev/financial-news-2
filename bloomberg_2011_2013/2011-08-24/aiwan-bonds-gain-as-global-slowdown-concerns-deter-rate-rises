Taiwan’s government bonds gained for
the first time in three days on speculation the central bank
will refrain from raising borrowing costs as a worsening outlook
for the global economy threatens exports. The island’s currency
weakened.  Industrial production rose 3.93 percent in July from a year
earlier, less than the 5.39 percent increase forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of economists, data showed yesterday. Sales of
new homes in the U.S. last month also came in below what
analysts had forecast. The island’s central bank raised its
policy rate at each of its last five quarterly meetings, lifting
it most recently to 1.875 percent in June. Taiwan’s benchmark
stock index fell 0.6 percent, after a 3.3 percent gain yesterday.  “The market is starting to price in a pause in rates in
September,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First
Securities Inc. in Taipei. “There was a big rally in stocks
yesterday, which drove up bond yields. Today’s fall in rates
could be seen as a market correction too.”  The yield on the 2 percent bonds due July 2016 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.01 percent as of
the 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei, prices from Gretai Securities
Market show. The rate rose five basis points yesterday, the
biggest increase for benchmark five-year securities since June.  Taiwan’s dollar closed 0.1 percent weaker at NT$29.025
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc.  There were 298,000 new homes sold in the U.S. in July, data
showed yesterday. That was less than 312,000 in June and the
310,000 that economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was unchanged at 0.384 percent, according
to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
