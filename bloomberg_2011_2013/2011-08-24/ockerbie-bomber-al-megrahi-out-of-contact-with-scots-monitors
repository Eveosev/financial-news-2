The Scottish municipality charged
with monitoring freed Lockerbie bomber Abdel Basset Al-Megrahi
hasn’t been able to contact him since Libyan rebels entered
Tripoli three days ago.  East Renfrewshire Council has to ensure Al-Megrahi, who has
prostate cancer, doesn’t break conditions imposed by Scottish
Justice Minister Kenny MacAskill when he freed him on
compassionate grounds in August 2009. Officials spoke to Al-
Megrahi within the past two weeks, George Barbour, a spokesman
for the municipality, said by telephone today.  “We are looking to get in touch with him earlier than we
would be expecting to,” Barbour said. “We need to be realistic
and take into account the conditions on the ground. We are not
at the moment concerned about the lack of contact.”  The battle for control of Tripoli, as rebels fight forces
loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi , has disrupted telephone and video
links, the municipality’s means of contacting Al-Megrahi. The
59-year-old was released two years ago on the grounds that he
was likely to die within months.  U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague  said yesterday that
the Scottish government should consider extraditing Al-Megrahi
back from  Libya . MacAskill’s office didn’t immediately respond
to requests for comment.  Al-Megrahi was convicted in 2001 of the killing of 270
people in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over the Scottish
town of Lockerbie in 1988. He was released after dropping his
appeal against his conviction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
