Fidelity Investments , the second-
biggest U.S. mutual-fund company, named Charles Morrison
president of its fixed-income unit as part of organizational
changes after the death last week of Boyce Greer.  Morrison, 50, who previously oversaw bonds and money funds
at Fidelity, was also named vice chairman of the Pyramis Global
Advisors unit, Stephen Austin, a spokesman for the Boston-based
firm, said in an interview today. Derek Young, who was appointed
as president of the asset-allocation unit on Aug., 1, will also
take the title of vice chairman of Pyramis, which manages money
for institutional clients.  Greer, the former head of Fidelity’s institutional
investments and vice chairman of Pyramis, died Aug. 14 at the
age of 55 in a kayaking accident in  Idaho . In their new roles,
Morrison and Young will report to Ronald O’Hanley, the president
of asset management at Fidelity, which manages about $1.66
trillion in assets.  Chris Sullivan , president of bonds, and  Bob Brown ,
president of money markets, will report to Morrison, who has
been with Fidelity for 24 years in various roles and oversaw the
firm’s money funds from 2004 to 2009. Morrison most recently led
“strategic projects” within Fidelity, including those gauging
the impact of the new Dodd-Frank rules and other regulations on
its funds.  The appointments were reported yesterday by Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
