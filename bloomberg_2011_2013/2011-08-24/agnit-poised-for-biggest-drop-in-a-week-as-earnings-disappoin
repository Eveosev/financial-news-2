6:45 p.m. close, their steepest loss since Aug. 18.  Magnit reported second-quarter net income of 4 billion
rubles ($139 million), compared with 3.95 billion rubles a year
earlier, the company said in a statement today.  Analysts led by Tigran Hovhannisyan at UralSib Financial
Corp. said Magnit’s earning were 5.3 percent below their
forecasts and 9.8 percent below consensus, according to an e-
mailed report sent today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
