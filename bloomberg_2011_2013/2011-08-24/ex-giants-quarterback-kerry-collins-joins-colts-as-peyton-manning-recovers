(Corrects  Super Bowl  score in fifth paragraph.)  Former New York Giants quarterback
Kerry Collins agreed to terms with the Indianapolis Colts,
providing a veteran option as  Peyton Manning  recovers from a
neck injury.  The move comes two months after the 38-year-old Collins
announced his retirement from the  National Football League ,
following a 16-year career with five teams. Terms of the
agreement weren’t disclosed, team spokesman Avis Roper said in a
telephone interview.  Manning, an 11-time Pro Bowl selection, is on the team’s
physically unable to perform list and hasn’t played since having
offseason neck surgery. The other two primary quarterbacks on
the Colts’ roster, Curtis Painter and Dan Orlovsky, have
combined for seven NFL starts.  The Colts open the season against the Houston Texans on
Sept. 11.  Collins led the Giants to a Super Bowl berth after the 2000
season, losing to the Baltimore Ravens 34-7. He is second among
active quarterbacks with 40,441 yards passing, trailing
Manning’s 54,828.  Collins was selected by the  Carolina Panthers  with the No.
5 pick in 1995, the first draft choice in franchise history. He
is 81-96 in 177 starts with the Panthers, New Orleans Saints,
Giants,  Oakland Raiders  and  Tennessee  Titans, throwing for 206
touchdowns and 195 interceptions.  Last season with Tennessee, Collins was 2-5 as a starter,
throwing for 14 touchdowns and eight interceptions.  Collins went 12-4 as a starter with the Giants in 2000,
when they won the National Football Conference East. He had five
touchdown passes in a 41-0 victory over the  Minnesota Vikings  in
the NFC Championship Game before struggling in the Super Bowl,
throwing four interceptions and posting a 7.1 passer rating.  Painter, 26, is 8 for 28 with two interceptions and no
touchdowns in his career and the 28-year-old Orlovsky hasn’t
thrown a pass since the 2008 season. The two have combined to
complete 44 percent of their passes for one touchdown and four
interceptions during the preseason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
