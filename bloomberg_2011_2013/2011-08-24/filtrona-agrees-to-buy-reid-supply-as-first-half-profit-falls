Filtrona Plc (FLTR) , a U.K. maker of
plastic packaging and cigarette filters, said it was considering
other acquisitions after agreeing to buy U.S. industrial parts
distributor Reid Supply Co. for as much as $32 million in cash.  The purchase will add products to Filtrona’s protection and
finishing division and increase the number of its U.S.
customers, Chief Executive Officer Colin Day said in a telephone
interview today.  Filtrona may complete the deal within three weeks and is
considering other acquisitions at least as big as the Muskegon,
Michigan-based company, in faster-growing markets such as China,
India and  Indonesia , he said.  “There are a number of deals out there -- that’s a key
element to the growth” of the company, Day said. “The Reid
size would be the baseline. That would be the sort of bottom end
for me.”  First-half profit fell 5.5 percent to 25.6 million pounds
($42 million), as the preceding year’s results had included a 5
million-pound profit from discontinued operations,  Milton
Keynes , England-based Filtrona said in a statement today.
Revenue for the six months ended June 30 climbed 8 percent to
268.6 million pounds.  Filtrona shares climbed 7.1 percent to 337.30 pence at the
4:30 p.m. close in  London . The stock has gained 39 percent this
year, giving the company a market value of 702.3 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
