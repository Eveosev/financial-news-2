South Africa ’s ruling African
National Congress said four more leaders of its youth wing will
face disciplinary action for deliberately disrupting meetings
and interfering with the orderly functioning of the
organization.  Sindiso Magaqa, Ronald Lamola, Pule Mabe, and Kenetswe
Mosenogi have been served with charges and will face the party’s
disciplinary committee, the Johannesburg-based ANC said in an e-
mailed statement today. ANC Youth League President  Julius Malema 
and spokesman Floyd Shivambu will face the disciplinary
committee for bringing the ANC into disrepute because of
comments around Botswana and sowing divisions in the ranks of
the ANC.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
