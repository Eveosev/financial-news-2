Ghana ’s cedi headed for a more than
two-week high against the dollar as stronger gold prices helped
boost sales by mining companies in West Africa’s second-biggest
economy.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
appreciated as much as 0.5 percent to 1.5182 per dollar, before
trading 0.1 percent up at 1.5255 per dollar as of 1:19 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
close at this level will be the cedi’s highest since Aug. 8.  Gold, which yesterday touched a record, rebounded from its
biggest drop since February 2010 in London as concern about
slowing economic growth and debt crises boosted demand for the
metal as a protection of wealth.  “Dollar flows from the  mining industry  are adding to
liquidity,” Othniel Kwainoe, a currency trader at Standard
Chartered Bank Ghana Ltd., said in a telephone interview today.
“The mining companies sell the dollars to finance their
activities in cedis, but I think the gold prices are also on
their side.”  Johannesburg-based AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. and Newmont
Mining Corp. of  Greenwood Village , Colorado, have mines in
Ghana, which follows  South Africa  in output of gold on the
continent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
