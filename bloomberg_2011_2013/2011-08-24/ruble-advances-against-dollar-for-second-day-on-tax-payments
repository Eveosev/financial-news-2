The ruble strengthened against the
dollar for a second day amid speculation exporters are
converting dollar revenue into the Russian currency to pay
taxes.  Russia ’s currency climbed 0.4 percent to 28.92 per dollar
at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow. The ruble was 0.3 percent
stronger at 41.6825 per euro, leaving it up 0.3 percent at
34.6631 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Exporters in the world’s biggest oil-producing nation need
to pay a total 330 billion rubles ($11 billion) of value-added,
excise and natural-resource taxes this week, according to HSBC
Holdings Plc estimates. Urals crude, Russia’s main oil export
blend, traded above $110 a barrel for the first time since Aug.
4 yesterday, before falling to $109.60 a barrel this morning.  “The need for rubles to pay taxes” is driving the
currency’s strength today, Alexei Moiseev, the Moscow-based
chief economist at VTB Capital, said by phone. “We’re entering
the tax payments period, so obviously we’re seeing exporters
selling dollars.”  Non-deliverable forwards show the currency at 29.2322 per
dollar in three months, compared with 29.2995 yesterday. The
contracts provide a guide to expectations of currency movements
and interest-rate differentials and allow companies to hedge
against currency shifts.  The ruble has been “overbought” in its 2.9 percent rally
against the dollar since Aug. 10, Moiseev said. VTB Capital
expects it to weaken 2 percent to 29.5 per dollar by the end of
2011, he said.  BRICs  The ruble has climbed 5.7 percent against the dollar so far
in 2011, beating all three of its peers in the so-called BRIC
group of emerging-market countries.  Brazil ’s real gained 3.6
percent against the greenback,  China ’s yuan appreciated 3.4
percent and  India ’s rupee lost 2.8 percent.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Russian government
dollar debt rather than U.S. Treasuries fell seven basis points
to 282, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global indexes.
The difference lost one basis point to 394 for  Kazakhstan  and
rose six basis points to 575 for Ukraine.  Russia’s domestic OFZ bonds declined, pushing the yield on
ruble-denominated debt due August 2016 up three basis points to
7.62 percent. The yield on the country’s benchmark ruble
Eurobond was little changed at 7.08 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
