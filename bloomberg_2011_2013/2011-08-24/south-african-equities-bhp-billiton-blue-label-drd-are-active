The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
rose 344.73, or 1.2 percent, to 29,604.59 in Johannesburg, its
strongest close in a week.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s largest producer
of the metal, dropped the most since March 10, falling 13.20
rand, or 4.1 percent, to 312.01 rand. Gold plunged in  New York ,
heading for the biggest drop in 18 months, on speculation that
financial markets may be stabilizing, eroding the appeal of the
precious metal as a haven.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s biggest mining
group, climbed 5.43 rand, or 2.4 percent, to 228.34 rand, the
highest in a week. The group raised its interim dividend 22
percent to 55 cents a share, beating a 50 cent estimate from UBS
AG and Deutsche Bank AG.    EOH Holdings Ltd. (EOH)  , a South African information
technology company, rallied the most in a year, gaining 1.45
rand, or 7.1 percent, to 22 rand. Earnings per share for the
year to July 31 rose 30 percent to 40 percent from a year
earlier, the company said in a trading statement.  Imperial Holdings Ltd. (IPL)  ,  South Africa ’s largest
auto dealer, fell for a third day, retreating 1.45 rand, or 1.3
percent, to 106.99 rand. The group said the volatile and
uncertain conditions in the global economy will make it
challenging for the company to achieve “meaningful” growth in
fiscal 2012.  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  , the world’s second-largest brewer,
added 5.94 rand, or 2.4 percent, to 252.86 rand, the highest
since July 28. Foster’s Group Ltd.,  Australia ’s biggest brewer,
said it is open to discussing a “sensible” bid with SABMiller
after refusing to enter detailed negotiations on the company’s
hostile A$9.5 billion ($10 billion) offer.  Village Main Reef Ltd. (VIL SJ), a mining investment
company, retreated the most in a month, dropping 8 cents, or 5.3
percent, to 1.42 rand. Production at the Tau Lekoa gold mine
