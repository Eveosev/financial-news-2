Russian stocks headed for their
first decline this week as oil, the country’s chief export
earner, fell in  New York .  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  slipped 0.2 percent to 1,440.71 as of 1:20
p.m. in Moscow, the first loss since Aug. 19. OAO Sberbank,
Russia’s largest lender, dropped 0.4 percent to 76.95 rubles.
The dollar-denominated RTS Index was little changed at 1,579.82.  Oil dropped from the highest closing price in four days in
New York before a report forecast to show crude supplies
increased in the U.S. last week, a sign demand for the commodity
may fall in the world’s largest economy. Crude for October
delivery fell 0.3 percent to $85.20 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
