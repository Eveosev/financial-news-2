Treasuries fell, pushing 10-year
note yields to the highest in a week, after a report showed
durable goods orders rose in July more than forecast, renewing
optimism that the U.S. economic recovery may accelerate.  The yield on the 10-year note touched the highest level
since Aug. 17 as the report showed bookings for goods meant to
last at least three years rose the most in four months. The U.S.
will auction $35 billion of five-year notes today and $29
billion of seven-year debt tomorrow. Treasuries rose earlier,
led by the longest maturities, on concern that the  U.S. economy 
is slowing and the European debt crisis is deepening.  “It’s encouraging for the economy,” said Thomas Simons, a
government debt economist in  New York  at Jefferies Group Inc.,
one of 20 primary dealers that trades with the Federal Reserve.
“The Treasury market is looking squarely at the headlines. It
will probably track stocks for the rest of the day.”  Ten-year note yields rose five basis points to 2.20 percent
at 11:57 a.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The 2.125 percent security due in August 2021 fell
14/32, or $4.38 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 10/32.  Five-Year Sale  The five-year notes on offer today yielded 1.01 percent in
pre-auction trading, less than the record auction low of 1.26
percent on Sept. 28, 2010. The yield was 1.58 percent at the
previous sale on July 27. Investors bid for 2.62 times the
securities offered last month.  “The hope is that the five-year can fare well,” said
 Martin Mitchell , head government bond trader at the Baltimore
unit of Stifel Nicolaus & Co., a St. Louis-based brokerage firm.
There are “outside factors that lead to buyers on dips.”  The Treasury sold $35 billion of two-year notes at a record
low yield of 0.22 percent yesterday as investors sought the
shortest, safest tenors as a refuge from market turmoil.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt, was 1.98
percentage points. The spread narrowed to 1.99 percentage points
on Aug. 18, the least since Oct. 13, 2010. It has averaged 2.06
percentage points during the past five years.  Yields on most Treasuries were at almost record lows amid
speculation  Federal Reserve  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will signal
in an Aug. 26 speech at  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , that policy
makers are willing to take further measures to prevent the U.S.
returning to recession.  Bernanke Role  “People are thinking the worst is behind us,” said
 Michael Franzese , managing director and head of Treasury trading
at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in New York. “Stocks are getting
a feel that Bernanke will be involved in the market.”  Treasury bulls are in the minority. Most investors predict
yields will rise because the economy is still growing. A
Bloomberg survey of financial companies with more recent
forecasts given heavier weightings projects the 10-year yield
will climb to 2.74 percent by year-end. The pace of economic
expansion will quicken to 2.1 percent in the third quarter from
1.3 percent in the second, a separate survey showed.  The current rate of inflation, 3.6 percent as measured by
the  consumer price index , means 10-year notes yield negative
1.47 percent after accounting for costs in the economy.  Bond Returns  U.S. government securities have surged 3.1 percent this
month, based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch data, as investors
sought the security of debt while stocks tumbled. The MSCI All
Country World Index of stocks has handed investors a loss of
almost 12 percent since the end of July, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed after
rising as much as 1.1 percent. Gold futures for December
delivery plunged 4.1 percent to $1,785.20 an ounce on the Comex
in New York.  Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years rose
4 percent after falling a revised 1.3 percent in June, a
Commerce Department report showed today in  Washington . The
median projection of 81 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
called for a 2 percent gain. Orders minus the volatile
transportation equipment category unexpectedly climbed 0.7
percent.  The  U.S. budget deficit  is projected to be $1.3 trillion in
the year ending Sept. 30, down from $1.4 trillion forecast in
April because of curbs on federal spending, the  Congressional
Budget Office  said.  The nonpartisan CBO, in its semiannual look at the nation’s
fiscal health, also projected the deficit for the subsequent 12-
month period through Sept. 30, 2012, at $973 billion rather than
the $1.1 trillion forecast in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
