Nebraska Book Co., the operator of a
nationwide chain of college bookstores, won court approval to
seek creditors’ votes on a reorganization plan that gives
noteholders control of the company.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Peter Walsh approved the company’s
disclosure statement, a description of the plan, allowing them
to send the turnaround proposal to creditors, according to court
documents filed yesterday in Wilmington,  Delaware .  Nebraska Book reached an agreement on the restructuring
plan with holders of more than 95 percent of its 8.625 percent
senior subordinated notes and more than 75 percent of its 11
percent discount notes. The bookseller said in a June 27
statement that it will restructure about $450 million in debt of
its parent, NBC Acquisition Corp., and affiliates.  Under the plan, holders of $179.2 million in the 8.625
percent notes would convert the debt into 78 percent of the new
equity, $110 million in unsecured notes and a cash payment of
$30.6 million. The noteholders are projected to recoup about 87
cents on the dollar. The notes traded for 50 cents on the dollar
yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Holders of $77 million in 11 percent discount notes would
get the remaining 22 percent of the stock, for a projected
recovery of about 7 cents on the dollar. Those notes were
trading at 1 cent as of 12:05 p.m. New York time, according to
Trace.  Secured Lenders  Secured lenders, owed about $26.3 million, and secured
noteholders, owed about $200 million, would be paid in full with
cash, according to court documents. If the owners of the holding
company’s equity interests don’t oppose the plan, they would get
warrants to purchase 3 percent of the reorganized company’s
equity at an enterprise value of $500 million, and 5 percent of
the new stock if the enterprise value reaches $550 million.  Nebraska  Book scheduled an Oct. 4 hearing to seek court
approval of the reorganization plan, court papers show.  The company, based in Lincoln, Nebraska, listed about
$657.2 million in assets and about $564 million in debt as of
Feb. 14, including the debt and assets of affiliates, in Chapter
11 documents filed June 27.  The company said in court papers that it was forced to seek
bankruptcy after “several years of declining or stagnant levels
of profitability” at bookstores, predominately those located off
campus.  Nebraska Book has about 280 stores on and off campuses. It
also has one of the largest wholesale distribution networks of
used textbooks, supplying college bookstores with more than
105,000 different titles and selling more than 6.3 million books
a year.  The case is In re Nebraska Book Co. Inc., 11-12005,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
