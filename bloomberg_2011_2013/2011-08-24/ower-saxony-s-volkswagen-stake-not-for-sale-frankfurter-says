The German state of  Lower Saxony 
won’t sell its stake in Volkswagen as it tries to reduce the
amount of new debt to zero by 2017, the state’s Finance Minister
Hartmut Moellring told  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  in an
interview.  The state may look at selling its stake in Hanover airport
provided there are interested bidders, the newspaper cites
Moellring as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
