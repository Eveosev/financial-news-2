(Corrects where Fast Retailing is based in second
paragraph.)  Fast Retailing Co.,  Japan ’s biggest
apparel chain, said it has formed an alliance with Mitsui
Fudosan Co., the nation’s largest developer, to expand business
in  East Asia .  Fast Retailing, based in Yamaguchi prefecture, and Mitsui
Fudosan, will share information about retail properties in East
Asia as the retailer aims to accelerate opening of its Uniqlo
brand stores, according to a statement released on the
retailer’s website. Meanwhile, Mitsui Fudosan aims to broaden
its retail property business in the region, it said.  The latest alliance builds on the two companies’ past
experiences of opening Uniqlo shops in Mitsui Fudosan’s projects
in Japan, the statement said. Mitsui Fudosan, which generated
less than 10 percent of its profit overseas, is expanding its
business outside of Japan including  China .  Tokyo-based Mitsui Fudosan plans to build “several”
shopping centers in cities including Beijing from 2014, after
completing its first mall in  Shanghai  by 2013, said Takehito Fukui, a project manager of the retail properties division at
Mitsui Fudosan last year. The plan will depend on the completion
of the Shanghai project, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
