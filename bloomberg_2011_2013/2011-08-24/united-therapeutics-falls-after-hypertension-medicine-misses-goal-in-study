United Therapeutics Corp. (UTHR)  fell the
most in almost three years after its experimental lung-disorder
drug failed in a study.  United Therapeutics, based in  Silver Spring , Maryland,
dropped $8.85, or 18 percent, to $39.91, at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading, the biggest single-day
decline since Nov. 17, 2008. The company has fallen 15 percent
in the past 12 months.  The 310-patient trial failed to show that the experimental
treatment helped patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension
walk farther, the study’s main goal. The medicine is an oral
version of the drug treprostinil, which is already approved to
treat the life-threatening lung disorder by injected,
intravenous and inhaled routes of administration.  “While we did not achieve a statistically significant
result for this trial, we believe the positive results from our
previously announced” studies support an application filing
with the  Food and Drug Administration  by the first half of 2012,
Roger Jeffs, United Therapeutics president and chief operating
officer, said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
