Namibia ’s central bank left its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged for a fourth consecutive
meeting to help support a recovery in the economy and as
inflation slowed from the fastest pace in more than a year.  The repo rate was kept at 6 percent, Bank of Namibia
Governor Ipumbu Shiimi told reporters today in the capital,
Windhoek. The bank has held the rate unchanged this year after
reducing it at the last two meetings of 2010 to boost growth.  The economy of Namibia, the world’s biggest miner of
offshore diamonds and the fourth-largest producer of uranium,
will probably expand less than an initial forecast of 4.1
percent for 2011, according to the central bank. The annual
inflation rate fell to 4.8 percent in July from 5.4 percent a
month earlier, the statistics office said on Aug. 11.  The decision is in line with the central bank of
neighboring  South Africa , which kept its benchmark rate at 5.5
percent last month. Namibia’s currency is pegged to the South
African rand and the central bank generally follows monetary
policy set by the South African Reserve Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
