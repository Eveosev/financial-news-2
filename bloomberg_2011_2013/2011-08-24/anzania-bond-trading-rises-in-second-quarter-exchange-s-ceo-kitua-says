Tanzania’s value of bonds traded in
the secondary market climbed to 240 billion shillings in the
second quarter, Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange Chief Executive
Officer Gabriel Kitua said.  The value of debt traded rose from 130 billion shillings in
the previous three months, he said in an interview today in
 Kenya ’s capital, Nairobi.  The Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange’s All Share Index, which
has advanced 9.5 percent this year, may rise a further five
percentage points by the end of 2011, driven by investor demand
for manufacturers such as Tanzania Cigarette Co. amid economic
growth and on share offerings expected in September by  Tanzania
Breweries Ltd. (TBL)  and Precision Air Ltd., he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
