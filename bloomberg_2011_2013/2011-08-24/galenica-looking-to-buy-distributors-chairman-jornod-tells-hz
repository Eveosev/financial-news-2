Galenica AG is “systematically”
looking for European distributors it can acquire to add its
sales network, Handelszeitung reported, citing Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Etienne Jornod.  Potential takeover targets have become less expensive
because of the Swiss franc’s advance against the euro, Jornod
was quoted as saying by the Zurich-based newspaper in an e-
mailed summary of an article to appear tomorrow.  Still, Galenica’s pharma division is suffering from strong
currency headwinds, and the company is considering whether to
cut jobs or ask workers to work longer or be paid in euros, he
said, according to the summary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
