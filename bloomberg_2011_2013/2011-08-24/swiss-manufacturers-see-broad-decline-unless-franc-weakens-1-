The Swiss manufacturers’ association
Swissmem said the country could face serious economic damage
unless a “clear weakening” of the Swiss franc begins soon.  “If that doesn’t happen, many companies will have to take
drastic decisions in the fall,” the industry group said today
in a faxed statement.  ‘What’s looming is nothing less than a
broad decline of  Switzerland ’s industrial base.’’  The franc’s “massive over-valuation” led to a decline in
orders for the first time since 2009, said the association,
whose members include ABB Ltd. and Sulzer Chemtech AG. Orders
fell 2.6 percent in the second quarter of 2011, compared with
the same period a year earlier, the statement said.  Last week the Swiss government announced a 2 billion-franc
spending plan to ease the pain to industry caused by the surging
franc. The  Swiss National Bank  on Aug. 3 cut key interest rates
to near zero. The central bank also increased sight deposits
almost seven-fold to boost liquidity. That might not be enough,
Swissmem said.  “Swissmem expects the SNB to continue along the path it
has laid out,” the statement said. “If necessary, it will have
to take even sharper measures.”  So far, the central bank has declined to set a target
exchange rate for the franc, which traded at 1.1420 to the euro
at 11:29 a.m. in Zurich.  To contact the reporters on this story:
