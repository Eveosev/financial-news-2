Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , whose
bankruptcy fees are approaching $1.4 billion, paid lawyers and
managers $28.6 million in July.  Restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal LLC, whose co-founder
 Bryan Marsal  runs the defunct investment bank, received
$460.1 million in fees for 34 1/2 months of “interim
management,” including about $9 million last month, according
to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, based in New York, whose fees
totaled $326.6 million for acting as Lehman’s lead bankruptcy
law firm, collected $7.7 million in July.  Marsal, who bills Lehman hourly, ended a fight for control
of the firm’s $65 billion liquidation by taking some potential
payments from bondholders including hedge fund Paulson & Co. to
give to derivatives creditors such as  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
The chief executive officer has said holders of $100 billion in
claims now support his liquidation plan, due to be voted on in
November.  Marsal has said he aims to raise $65 billion by selling the
defunct company’s assets in the next few years to pay estimated
claims of more than $300 billion. He will start distributing
some cash by next year, or more than three years after the
September 2008 bankruptcy filing, he has said.  Kimberly Macleod , a Lehman spokeswoman, declined to comment
on the fees.  July Cash  Lehman and its affiliates reported cash and investments of
$25.2 billion on July 31, compared with $24.4 billion on June
30. Of the July total, $2.7 billion was unavailable for use,
according to the filing.  The Lehman bankruptcy in  Manhattan  became the most
expensive in U.S. history in April 2010, when it topped the
$757 million cost of energy trader Enron Corp.’s three-year
liquidation, according to data compiled by Lynn LoPucki, a
bankruptcy-law professor at the University of California,  Los
Angeles .  Lehman’s creditors range from banks and hedge funds to the
New York Giants and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, as well as
individuals who hold Lehman bonds. Once the world’s fourth-
biggest investment bank, Lehman filed for bankruptcy on Sept.
15, 2008, with assets of $639 billion.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
