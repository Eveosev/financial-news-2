Greece ’s Cabinet approved a bill
that aims to enhance regulation of the financial sector and
ratify the July 21 European Union summit agreement to bolster
the country’s bailout package.  “The bill reinforces the Greek banking system’s stability
and especially of smaller banks,” according to an e-mailed
statement from the Athens-based  Finance Ministry  today. “The
bill includes the ability to divide a bank and create a
transitional credit institution under the control of the state,
with the reinforcement of the Financial Stability Fund and the
Hellenic Deposit & Investment Guarantee Fund.”  Greece’s 110 billion-euro ($158 billion) bailout from the
EU and the  International Monetary Fund  included the creation of
a 10 billion-euro stability fund to support the banking system.  EU and IMF officials said in their fourth review of the
aid program, released in July, that Greece’s central bank must
strengthen supervision and cooperation with the FSF. The bill is
scheduled to be put to parliament in September, under the EU-IMF
agreement.  The legislation is also intended to approve the July 21
overhaul of the European Financial Stability Facility, the
ministry said. “The new role of the EFSF is the euro zone’s
answer to market pressures” and it is critical to implement it
quickly, it said.  EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  urged governments last week
to ratify the 440 billion-euro rescue fund quickly so it can buy
bonds in the secondary market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
