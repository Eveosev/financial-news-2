European industrial orders
unexpectedly fell in June as slower growth in  Germany  and a
slump in  Spain  offset a surge in  France .  Orders in the euro area slipped 0.7 percent after rising
3.6 percent in May, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said today. Economists had forecast a gain of 0.4
percent, the median of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
showed. Orders rose 11.1 percent from a year earlier.  Euro-area manufacturers, who have relied on emerging-market
demand to power the region’s expansion, are now contending with
a global economic slowdown.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) , Germany’s largest
steelmaker, posted fiscal third-quarter earnings on Aug. 12 that
missed analysts’ estimates on slowing global demand and a sharp
drop in European consumption.  Euro-area industrial production unexpectedly declined 0.7
percent in June, the biggest monthly drop since September 2010,
adding to signs that growth is losing momentum as governments
struggle to contain the sovereign debt crisis.  The euro was little changed after the data were released,
trading at $1.4454 at 11:03 a.m. in Brussels.  Industrial orders in Germany rose 1.2 percent in June after
a 1.9 percent increase a month earlier, today’s report showed.
Spain posted a 1.5 percent decline after 4.2 percent growth a
month earlier, while French orders soared 13.8 percent.  Euro-area orders for intermediate goods dropped 5.3 percent
in June after a 2.8 percent increase a month earlier. Orders for
durable  consumer goods  slipped 3.4 percent, while those for
capital goods rose 4.1 percent. Total orders excluding heavy
transport equipment such as ships and trains fell 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
