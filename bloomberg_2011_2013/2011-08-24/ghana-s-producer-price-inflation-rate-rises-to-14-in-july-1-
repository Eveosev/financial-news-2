Ghana’s  producer-price inflation
rate rose in July to 14 percent, the first increase since April,
as costs climbed in the manufacturing and mining industries.  Inflation accelerated from a revised 12.05 percent in June,
Ebo Duncan, an official with the  Ghana  Statistical Service, told
reporters in Accra, the capital, today.  Manufacturing costs, which make up 70 percent of the index,
rose 14.4 percent from 12 percent in June, while mining and
quarrying costs, which account for 14 percent of the overall
measure, increased 34.2 percent in July from 30.2 percent the
month before, Duncan said. Utility costs, which account for 16
percent of the overall index, were 0.3 percent higher in July,
he said.  Rising prices for companies in  Africa ’s second-biggest gold
producer may prompt the Bank of Ghana to keep its key lending
rate on hold at a Monetary Policy Committee meeting next week,
 Razia Khan , London-based head of Africa research at Standard
Chartered Bank Plc, said in an e-mailed note today.  The central bank cut the rate to 12.5 percent on July 6,
the second consecutive decrease. The bank will hold a press
conference to announce its next decision on Aug. 31.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
