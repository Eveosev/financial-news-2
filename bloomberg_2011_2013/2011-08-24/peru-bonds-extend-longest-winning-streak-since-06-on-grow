Peruvian bonds rose, extending their
longest winning streak in five years, as investors bet slower
growth will lead the central bank to keep  interest rates  on hold
for longer than expected.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.73 percent at 11:16 a.m.  New York  time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price
climbed 0.13 centimo to 114.60 centimos per sol.  Yields have fallen for 12 straight days, the longest streak
since the period ending Aug. 2, 2006.  Peru ’s central bank has kept its benchmark rate on hold at
4.25 percent during its last three meetings as global growth
eases and after a drop in investment caused the Peruvian economy
to slow. Gross domestic product rose at the slowest annual pace
in 17 months in June as cement demand fell and manufacturing
activity eased.  “A lot of people were still expecting hikes even after the
central bank put rates on hold,” said  Roberto Melzi , a Latin
America strategist at Barclays Capital Inc. in New York.
“Economic activity has been decelerating more than expected,
which has led people to re-price the monetary policy outlook.”  The Andean nation projects annual growth of 6 percent to
6.5 percent this year, compared with an average 7.2 percent in
the last five years.  The sol was little changed at 2.7320 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7330 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
