Indonesia ’s 10-year bonds advanced
for a third day, pushing yields to a record low, on speculation
the country’s yield advantage over the U.S will attract foreign
funds. The rupiah fell.  The spread between 10-year Indonesian local-currency bond
yields and similar-dated U.S. Treasuries reached 469 basis
points today, compared with this year’s low of 380 basis points
on Jan. 5. The  Federal Reserve  pledged on Aug. 9 to keep U.S.
interest rates near zero until mid-2013.  “The spread between Indonesian and U.S. bond yields is
widening,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank
Commonwealth in Jakarta. “That attracts investors to Indonesian
assets. The rupiah still has a tendency to appreciate.”  The yield on 8.25 percent notes maturing July 2021 slipped
two basis points, or 0.019 percentage point, to 6.81 percent as
of 4:21 p.m. in Jakarta, according to closing prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association. The rate also reached that
record low yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
dating back to 2003.  The rupiah traded at 8,551 per dollar, compared with 8,544
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
touched 8,453 on Aug. 2, the strongest level since March 2004.  Foreign ownership of Indonesian rupiah  government bonds  has
increased more than 25 percent this year through Aug. 23 to 246
trillion rupiah ($28.7 billion), figures from the debt
management office show. Offshore holdings peaked at 249.87
trillion rupiah on Aug. 3, before  Standard & Poor’s  lowered its
top AAA credit rating for the U.S. on Aug. 5  To contact the reporter on this story:
