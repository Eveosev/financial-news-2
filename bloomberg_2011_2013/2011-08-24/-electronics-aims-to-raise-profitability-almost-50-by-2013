TT Electronics Plc (TTG) , a U.K. maker of
car sensors for Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Volkswagen AG,
expects to raise its profit margin by almost 50 percent by the
end of 2013.  TT’s operating margin will reach 8 percent by the fourth
quarter of 2013 compared with 5.4 percent at the end of the
first half, up from 4.1 percent a year earlier, the Weybridge,
England-based company said in a statement today.  “If you have got the right strategy and are in the right
markets, most markets are still growing,” Chief Executive
Officer Geraint Anderson said in a telephone interview. “There
is still a lot for us to do internally in terms of self-help
action.”  TT is focusing on growth industries including “high-end”
automotive products, critical safety sensors, medical components
and defense to boost profitability. It’s opening a new plant in
eastern  Europe  and expanding in  Mexico  and  China  to meet demand,
as well as closing a factory in  North Carolina .  First-half net income surged 70 percent to 17.3 million
pounds ($28.6 million), or 11.1 pence a share, from 10.2 million
pounds, or 6.6 pence, a year earlier, TT said in the statement.
Revenue rose 12 percent to 294.6 million pounds.  The shares fell 16.25 pence, or 10 percent, to 142 pence at
the close in London trading, the biggest drop in three weeks,
extending this year’s decline to 17 percent and paring TT’s
market value to about 220 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
