Orange-juice  futures fell the most
in two weeks on forecasts showing Hurricane Irene will miss
Florida, the world’s biggest citrus grower after  Brazil . Cotton
also declined.  Irene, which was 250 miles (402 kilometers) southeast of
Nassau in the Bahamas at 2 p.m. New York time, is forecast to
pass near the North Carolina coast and strike southern New
England late Aug. 28 or Aug. 29, according to the National
Hurricane Center.  “Florida is not in the track of the storm, so we’re not
seeing people coming in and buying,”  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst
at Transworld Futures, said in a telephone interview from Tampa,
Florida. “No news means weaker prices right now.”  Orange juice for November delivery fell 2.95 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $1.6025 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S., the
biggest decline since Aug. 10.  Damage to Southeast U.S. cotton crops from Hurricane Irene
is also likely to be minimal given its current track,  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in Mandeville, Louisiana, said in
a telephone interview.  Cotton for December delivery fell 0.25 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $1.0499 a pound, after touching $1.09, the highest
since July 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
