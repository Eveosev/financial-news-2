Crude oil declined in  New York  after
the dollar increased and gold plunged the most in more than
three years, curbing investor interest in raw materials.  Futures dropped 0.3 percent as the U.S. currency rebounded
against the euro, reducing the appeal of dollar-denominated
commodities as an investment. Gold plunged the most since March
2008 on speculation financial markets are stabilizing. Oil rose
as much as 1.4 percent earlier when the Energy Department said
supplies fell 2.21 million barrels to 351.8 million last week.  “The dollar finished the day a bit higher, which sent oil
lower,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest
in  Chicago . “A lot of traders are diversified, and when gold
dropped they probably had to sell oil because of margin calls.”  Crude oil for October delivery fell 28 cents to settle at
$85.16 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are
up 19 percent over the past year.  Brent oil for October settlement increased 84 cents, or 0.8
percent, to end the session at $110.15 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark
contract was at a $24.99 a barrel premium to U.S. futures, down
from a record $26.21 on Aug. 19 based on closing prices.  The dollar gained versus all of its 16 most-traded peers
amid speculation about whether Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will say this week that the Fed is willing to provide
greater stimulus for the economy. He’s meeting with central
bankers in Jackson Hole,  Wyoming .  ‘The Main Drivers’  “Economic perceptions remain the main drivers,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “All eyes will be on  Jackson Hole , and
whether there will be an announcement that’s good for the
economy and the oil market.”  The U.S. currency rose 0.1 percent to $1.4425 against the
euro from $1.4442 yesterday.  Gold for December delivery tumbled $104, or 5.6 percent, to
settle at $1,757.30 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Prices
surpassed $1,900 for the first time ever this week. The S&P GSCI
Index of 24 raw materials slipped 0.3 percent to 650.41.
Eighteen commodities dropped.  “Oil has stayed well propped up,” said Todd Horwitz,
chief strategist at Adam Mesh Trading Group in New York. “The
gold bubble appears to have popped, and it’s probably only a
matter of time before the same thing happens to oil.”  Refineries operated at 90.3 percent of capacity, equaling
the 2011 high set July 15, the Energy Department report showed.
Operating rates were forecast to be unchanged at 89.1 percent,
according to the median of 13 analyst responses in a Bloomberg
news survey.  Refinery Profits  Refinery margins as expressed by the so-called crack spread
climbed to a record $37.957 a barrel Aug. 19. The profit to
process three barrels of oil into two of gasoline and one of
heating oil, based on New York futures prices, climbed to $33.57
today and has averaged $19.87 in the past year.  Gasoline inventories rose 1.36 million barrels to 211.4
million in the week ended Aug. 19, the report showed.  Supplies of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, increased 1.73 million barrels to 155.7
million, highest level since February. Distillate fuel output
rose 2.9 percent to 4.68 million barrels a day, the highest
level since July 2008.  Consumption of distillate fuel climbed 8.4 percent to 3.85
million barrels a day in the week ended Aug. 19, the department
said. Gasoline demand dropped 2 percent to 9.01 million barrels
a day, the report showed.  Libyan Conflict  In  Libya , rebels seized control of Muammar Qaddafi’s
compound in Tripoli yesterday after battling loyalist forces for
control of the capital for a third day. Today, fighters are
closing in on the loyalist-held town of Sirte, Qaddafi’s
hometown and one of the last strongholds of his forces, said the
rebel Military Council in Misrata.  Oil production may take a year to reach the previous total
of 1.5 million barrels a day, Ahmed Jehani, chairman of the
rebels’ stabilization team, told reporters yesterday in Dubai.
The country’s production fell to 100,000 barrels a day last
month, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Federal Reserve 
will act to stimulate the economy.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 478,976
contracts as of 3:26 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 572,256
contracts yesterday, 16 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.47 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
