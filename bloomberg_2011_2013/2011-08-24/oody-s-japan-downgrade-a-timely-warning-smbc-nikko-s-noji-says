Makoto Noji, a senior bond and
currency strategist in  Tokyo  at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.,
comments on the downgrade of Japan today by Moody’s Investors
Service.  Moody’s lowered Japan’s sovereign credit rating by one step
to Aa3.  On the timing of the downgrade:  “The timing, before the election scheduled on Aug. 29 by
the ruling Democratic Party of Japan to select its next leader,
was good. Moody’s has long expressed concerns about the
instability of Japanese politics. We hope that the downgrade
will get candidates to outline their medium- to long-term plans
for managing the nation’s economy and finances.”  “It may become more difficult for the contenders to talk
about party promises in manifestos. Changes in taxes and social
security may become a focus of debate. A candidate may have
trouble attracting support unless he makes it clear that he’ll
work to clean up government finances.”  On the impact on Japanese bonds:  “In the short-term, the downgrade won’t prompt bond buying
because it came just before events in focus, such as tomorrow’s
20-year bond auction and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s meeting in
 Jackson Hole .”  “More attention will be paid to fiscal issues at the
 Democratic Party ’s election because of the rating cut, so the
downgrade may ease concerns in the  bond market  going forward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
