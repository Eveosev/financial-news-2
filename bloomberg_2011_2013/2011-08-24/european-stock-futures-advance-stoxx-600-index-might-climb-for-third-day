European stocks climbed for a third
day after a report on U.S. durable-goods orders beat forecasts
amid ongoing speculation that the Federal Reserve will act to
bolster the economy.  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Fiat SpA (F)  led a gauge of automakers to the
biggest gain in 13 months. Ageas, the majority owner of
Belgium’s largest life insurer, surged 21 percent after
announcing a buyback.  WPP Plc (WPP) , the world’s largest advertising
company, advanced 7.4 percent as profit beat estimates.  Heineken
NV (HEIA) , the world’s third-biggest brewer by volume, tumbled the most
since 2003 after saying earnings are unlikely to grow this year.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 1.4 percent to 229.79 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , extending the advance from the
two-year low reached at the end of last week to 3 percent. The
gauge has still fallen 21 percent from this year’s peak on Feb.
17 as European and U.S. economic data that trailed economists’
forecasts added to concern the global recovery is at risk.  “Everyone is waiting for Friday’s meeting of the  Federal
Reserve ,” said John Plassard, a director at Louis Capital
Markets in Geneva. “Until then, every bit of good news, such as
the strong durable-goods numbers, will support the markets.”  Central bankers are meeting this weekend in  Jackson Hole ,
 Wyoming . At last year’s event, Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s
hint of a second round of asset purchases, or quantitative
easing, spurred a 28 percent jump in the  Standard & Poor’s  500
index through April.  FTSE, CAC 40  National benchmark indexes advanced in all of the 18
western European markets, except Greece and Iceland.  France ’s
CAC 40 rose 1.8 percent, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 1.5 percent
and  Germany ’s DAX Index climbed 2.7 percent.  The valuation of Stoxx 600 companies as a multiple of their
estimated earnings has slipped to 9.5, near the lowest since
March 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Investors are starting to look through the dark cloud to
see the promised land of cheap valuations,” said  Henk Potts ,
who helps oversee $239 billion as an equity strategist at
Barclays Wealth in London. “It’s not bargains that matter, it
is buyers. And finally investors seem to be willing to put their
heads above the parapet.”  European stocks extended their gains as a Commerce
Department report showed that U.S. orders for durable goods
climbed more than forecast in July. Bookings for goods meant to
last at least three years rose 4 percent, the most in four
months, after falling a revised 1.3 percent in June. The median
projection of 81 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called
for a 2 percent gain.  Automakers Advance  Daimler, the maker of Mercedes trucks and luxury cars, rose
5.2 percent to 36.05 euros and Fiat climbed 6.6 percent to 4.21
euros as a gauge of European carmakers rallied the most of the
19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  The gain in U.S. durable-goods orders reflected a rebound
in production at vehicle makers following supply disruptions
caused by the earthquake in  Japan  in March. Orders for motor
vehicles and parts jumped 12 percent, the most since 2003.  Ageas (AGS) , the majority owner of Belgium’s largest life
insurer, rose 21 percent to 1.33 euros, the most since May 2010,
after saying it will buy back as much as 250 million euros ($360
million) of shares. The company also reported a first-half net
loss of 58.8 million euros, narrower than the 115 million-euro
loss analysts had projected.  WPP, Tullow  WPP jumped 7.4 percent to 623 pence as first-half earnings
beat analysts’ estimates after sales in emerging markets grew 11
percent from a year earlier. Profit, excluding some items such
as the impact of interest and taxes, rose to 517.9 million
pounds ($854 million) from 455.3 million pounds a year ago,
beating the 512.6 million pounds analysts had forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the London-based explorer with the most
licenses in  Africa , rallied 8.4 percent to 1,026 pence after
saying that profit after tax more than tripled to $330 million
as oil production from  Ghana  boosted revenue in the first six
months of the year.  Man Group Plc (EMG) , the world’s largest hedge fund manager,
soared 10 percent to 216.1 pence after Nitin Arora, an analyst
at HSBC Holdings Plc, raised the stock to “overweight” from
“underweight.”  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s second-largest cement maker,
jumped 5 percent to 46.55 Swiss francs after Credit Suisse Group
AG lifted the company’s shares to “outperform” from
“neutral.”  Hochtief, Carillion  A gauge of construction companies was among the best
performers of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  Hochtief
AG (HOT) , Germany’s largest builder, rose 3.4 percent to 46.34 euros
and  Carillion Plc (CLLN) , a U.K. support and construction-services
company, added 3.8 percent to 323 pence. Carillion was raised to
“buy” from “add” by Howard Seymour, an analyst at Numis
Securities Ltd.  Heineken dropped 7.6 percent to 33.44 euros, its biggest
slump since June 2003, after reporting first-half earnings
before interest and taxation, excluding one-time items, of 1.26
billion euros, missing the median analyst estimate of 1.37
billion euros.  The company said full-year profit is unlikely to grow,
saying so-called organic net income for 2011 will be “broadly
in line” with last year’s 1.45 billion euros. Analysts forecast
adjusted profit of 1.68 billion euros.  Royal Unibrew A/S, Scandinavia’s second-largest brewer,
sank 5.6 percent to 269 kroner after the company said it expects
2011 revenue and earnings to be in the lower end of its
previously expected ranges due to “unusually bad weather” and
consumer restraint, especially in Italy.  Admiral Group Plc (ADM)  slumped 12 percent to 1,353 pence, the
biggest drop since December 2008. The U.K. car insurer posted
first-half pretax profit that missed analyst estimates after it
held back more cash to cover claims from previous years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
