Guinea , the worldâ€™s biggest exporter
of bauxite, said a 5 percent increase in production of the
metal, as well as a rise in output of other commodities, helped
the West African nation post a first-half budget surplus.  Bauxite rose to 8.2 million metric tons from 7.8 million
tons, while diamond production increased 41 percent to 202,880
carats, according to the  Finance Ministry . The fiscal surplus
was 81.2 billion Guinea francs ($12 million) compared with a
deficit of 1.5 trillion francs a year earlier, the Conakry-based
ministry said in a statement handed to reporters today.  Guinea is attempting to restore economic stability after a
period of military rule that ended with the November election of
President  Alpha Conde . The economy may grow 4 percent this year
from 1.9 percent in 2010, Budget Minister Mohamed Diare said May
18.  Gold output declined 15 percent to 372,560 ounces in the
period, while production of electricity dropped 6.6 percent to
269,372 megawatts, according to the statement.  Cement production rose 29 percent to 195,460 tons, coffee
output increased 14 percent to 21,170 tons, palm oil processing
was 30 percent higher at 6,370 tons and cocoa production jumped
to 22,650 tons from 1,670 tons in the first half of 2010, the
ministry said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
