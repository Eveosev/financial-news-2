The biggest earthquake in Virginia
in more than 100 years should lead the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission to impose tougher reactor-safety standards,
Representative  Edward Markey  said.  A 5.8-magnitude temblor yesterday in central Virginia cut
power to Dominion Resources Inc.’s North Anna nuclear plant,
about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Richmond, forcing
reliance on diesel generators. Power was restored later
yesterday. The quake also spurred operators at 12 plants from
 North Carolina  to  Michigan  to declare “unusual events,” the
NRC’s lowest-level emergency designation.  “The Virginia earthquake is now our local 911 call to stop
delaying the implementation of stricter safety standards,”
Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, wrote today in a letter to NRC
Chairman  Gregory Jaczko .  The NRC is considering new regulations for 104 U.S.
reactors after a March earthquake and tsunami caused meltdowns
and radiation leaks at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-
Ichi plant. By Oct. 3, NRC officials must determine actions in
response to an NRC task-force report in July that made
recommendations to bolster reactor safety.  The epicenter of the earthquake was less than 15 miles from
the North Anna plant. The facility’s twin reactors were halted
automatically, and back-up generators switched on to provide
power for cooling. Dominion today said it is placing the
reactors into “cold” shutdown for damage inspections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
