Billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s investment
fund Inmobiliaria Carso SA added to its holdings in  New York
Times Co. (NYT)  and  Saks Inc. (SKS)  on Aug. 19 for a second straight day.  The fund bought 450,000 Times Co. shares and 279,000
Saks shares that day, according to U.S. regulatory filings
today. Those purchases boosted Slim’s stakes in Times Co. to
7.5 percent and in Saks to 16.2 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Slim is buying shares of both companies for the first time
since 2009 after last week’s market turmoil sent the stocks to
lows of at least 11 months. He spent $14 million on Saks and
Times Co. shares on Aug. 18 and Aug. 19, according to regulatory
filings. His publicly disclosed holdings are valued at about
$63 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Times Co. rose 30 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $7.30 at
10:13 a.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. Saks
gained 40 cents, or 4.6 percent, to $9.14. Both companies are
based in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
