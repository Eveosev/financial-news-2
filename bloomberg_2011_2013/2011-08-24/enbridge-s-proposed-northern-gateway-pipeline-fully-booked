Enbridge Inc. (ENB) , Canada’s largest
pipeline operator, has obtained all the shipping agreements it
needs to support construction of its C$5.5 billion ($5.6
billion) Northern Gateway pipeline.  “This support demonstrates the need for Northern Gateway
and is a major step forward for the project,” Janet Holder,
executive vice president for western access at Calgary-based
Enbridge, said in a statement today.  The project, which would reduce Canada’s dependency on U.S.
markets by shipping crude to the West Coast for export to  Asia ,
still faces regulatory hurdles and opposition from
environmentalists and Canadian Indian groups.  The 732-mile (1,177-kilometer) pipeline, which would run
from near Edmonton, Alberta to Kitimat, British Columbia, is
fully subscribed with long-term commitments from producers, the
company said. The proposed project would have the capacity to
export 525,000 barrels a day of crude produced in  Canada ’s oil
sands and import 193,000 barrels a day of natural-gas
condensate.  Alberta has the third-largest crude reserves in the world
after  Saudi Arabia  and Venezuela with 175 billion barrels of
recoverable oil, according to the Canadian Association of
Petroleum Producers.  Enbridge rose 19 cents to C$31.71 at 10:06 a.m. on the
Toronto Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
