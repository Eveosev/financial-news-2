Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  deferred an
order of 100 small narrow-body jets until 2012, delaying talks
with planemakers such as  Embraer SA (EMBR3) , as it prepares to buy 100
 Boeing Co. (BA)  737s, a person familiar with the matter said.  Discussions with Embraer and competitor Bombardier Inc.
advanced this year while Atlanta-based Delta negotiated with
Boeing and Airbus SAS for the larger planes, said the person,
who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly. The Boeing deal was
described this week by people familiar with that purchase.  Embraer and Bombardier are trying to create a niche for
jets smaller than those from Airbus and Boeing. Single-aisle
planes from Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil-based Embraer or
Bombardier would complement Delta’s mainline fleet of Boeing and
Airbus narrow-bodies.  “After talks with Delta, Embraer expects that Delta’s
decision whether to buy its planes or equivalents from
competitors will only be made next year,” Embraer Executive
Vice President Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva said yesterday in an
e-mailed statement.  Embraer hasn’t decided whether to build a new plane or a
version of its largest regional jet with new engines to compete
with Montreal-based Bombardier’s CSeries. Bombardier targets a
2013 debut for that plane, which has a list price of $58.3
million for the CS100 model and $66.6 million for the CS300.  Trebor Banstetter, a spokesman for Delta, and Bombardier’s
 John Arnone  declined to comment.  No Timeline  People familiar with the matter had said on Aug. 22 that
Delta had delayed a decision beyond this week on buying smaller
narrow-body aircraft, without giving the size of the planned
purchase or a new timetable.  Delta’s plan to order Boeing 737-900ERs would have a list
value of about $8.58 billion, based on list prices. Airlines
typically buy planes at a discount.  The 737-900ER is the largest variant of Chicago-based
Boeing’s 737 family, the world’s most widely flown jetliner, and
seats about 200 passengers. Bombardier has targeted the CSeries
as a rival to planes with 100 to 149 seats.  Early customers for the CSeries include Korean Air Lines,
which ordered 10 CS300 jets in June at the  Paris Air Show . The
CSeries has a 20 percent fuel advantage over similar planes,
according to Bombardier.  Delta had said in January that it planned to buy 100 to 200
narrow-body jets and seek options for 200 more, with deliveries
starting as soon as 2013. The company said it would consider
small, medium and large single-aisle aircraft.  To contact the reporters on this story:
