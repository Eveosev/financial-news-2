Egyptian government officials and
banks are “afraid” to take investment decisions during the
country’s transitional period, Ahmed Heikal, chairman of Citadel
Capital SAE said in an interview with Al Arabiya Television
station.  “Everybody knows that this is a transitional period,”
Heikal told the Dubai-based broadcaster. “So banks are worried
and afraid, and this is normal.” Citadel Capital is an Egyptian
private-equity firm with $8.7 billion in assets under
management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
