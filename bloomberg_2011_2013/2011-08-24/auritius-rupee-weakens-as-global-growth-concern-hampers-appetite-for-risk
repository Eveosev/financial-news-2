Mauritius’s rupee weakened against
the dollar after German business confidence fell to the lowest
in more than a year, raising concern the global economic
recovery is faltering and damping demand for riskier assets.  The currency depreciated as much as 1.2 percent to 28.1 per
dollar and traded 0.6 percent down at 27.95 by 1:34 p.m. in  Port
Louis , the capital. Against the euro, the rupee climbed 0.4
percent to 40.4207.  Business confidence in Germany,  Europe ’s largest economy,
declined to 108.7 in August from 112.9 in July, the lowest since
July 2010. Economists forecast a decline to 111, according to
the median prediction of 37 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. Investor confidence plunged the most in five years in
August, the ZEW Center for European Economic Research in
Mannheim said yesterday, citing fears of a U.S. recession and
Europe’s debt crisis.  The data have “confirmed the slowdown which the global
economy is experiencing,” analysts at Mauritius Commercial
Bank, the country’s largest lender by market value, wrote in an
e-mailed note today. “ Germany , being one of the major actors in
trying to stem the European debt crisis, could review its stance
as domestic growth stagnates.”  Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation with a population
of 1.3 million, has a six-year contract to 2015 to sell its
refined white sugar to Germany’s Suedzucker AG. Europe, led by
France and  Italy , is biggest buyer of Mauritian goods, the
 Central Statistics Office  said on Aug. 22. Europe also accounts
for almost two-thirds of visitors to the island, where tourism
and textiles are the biggest foreign-currency earners.  Buying prices for the dollar were from 27.1844 to 27.3496
rupees, while the selling price was 28.6446 per dollar, compared
with 28.697 on Aug. 23, according to indicative exchange rates
published today on the  Bank of Mauritius’s website .  The 38-member SEMDEX index of the Mauritian official stock
market climbed for a second day, advancing 0.4 percent to
1,940.53 by the 1:30 p.m. close, led by  State Bank  of Mauritius
Ltd., the country’s second-largest lender by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
