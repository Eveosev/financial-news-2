A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell from the highest level since June 2010 as investors
weighed what the  Federal Reserve  will do to bolster the
faltering economy.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, declined 1 basis point to a mid-
price of 125 basis points as of 5:35 p.m. in New York, according
to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. The cost to protect
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  debt for five years fell from the highest
level since April 2009, while contracts for one year jumped.  The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates, had soared to as high as 129.6 basis
points from 96.3 at the end of last month as concern mounts that
the global economic recovery is fading and as  Europe ’s sovereign
crisis spreads. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and other central
bankers meet this week in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, as U.S.
unemployment holds above 9 percent.  “You do have a number of potential policy headline events
that could stem the tide” of negative sentiment, said  Rizwan Hussain , a credit strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York.  Contracts protecting against a default by  Charlotte , North
Carolina-based Bank of America dropped 12 basis points to 372.6
basis points, according to data provider CMA. That means it
would cost $372,600 annually to protect $10 million of the debt
for five years.  Swaps protecting the debt against losses for one year
jumped 24.4 basis points to 460, according to CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market.  An inverted curve signals traders are pricing in a greater
probability of credit deteriorating in the shorter term.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
