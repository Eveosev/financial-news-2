CEVA Inc. (CEVA) , the developer of chips
available in most iPhones and iPads, is beating U.S.-traded
semiconductor makers as it benefits from rising demand for data
on smartphones and tablets.  The  Mountain View , California-based company created in 2002
as a spin-off from Israel-founded DSP Group Ltd. jumped 30
percent in the past year, the best performer among 40 stocks in
the Russell 2000 Growth Electronics Semi-Conductors/Components
Industry. CEVA, which has most of its research and development
facilities in Herzliya,  Israel , rose 1 percent to $26.59
yesterday. The Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index of the biggest
Israeli companies traded in the U.S. fell 0.01 percent to 83.91.  The maker of processors is benefiting from higher demand
for its products as an increasing number of consumers use
smartphones and handsets to surf the Web, play games and
download music and videos.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  accounted for 18.5 percent
of global smartphone shipments in the second quarter, compared
with 13.5 percent a year earlier, research group Strategy
Analytics said on July 29.  “These guys are on almost every apple phone, which means
when Apple is doing well, CEVA is doing well,” said Jay Srivatsa, an analyst at Chardan Capital Markets in  New York .
“CEVA can be a derivative plays on Apple.”  Shares of Apple, based in Cupertino, Califorina, are up 57
percent over the past 12 months. Apple rose 0.7 percent to
$376.18 yesterday.  Earnings Rise  CEVA’s second-quarter earnings surged 83 percent to 22
cents per share, beating the 17 cents median forecast of 10
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, as it boosted its market share
in third generation, smart phone handsets, the company said on
July 26 in a PRNewswire statement on July 26.  Increasing demand in China for smartphones will also boost
the company’s revenue, according to Andrew Uerkwitz, an analyst
at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York.  Spreadtrum Communications Inc. (SPRD) , the Chinese maker of
mobile-phone chips who uses CEVA’s technology exclusively, said
on Aug. 4 that second-quarter net income almost tripled to $32.5
million from $11.1 million a year earlier.  “China is the biggest growth driver for CEVA,” Uerkwitz
said. “These kinds of high performance and low costs chips
thrive in emerging markets.”  Israel’s benchmark TA-25 Index slumped 0.9 percent to
1,105.59 at 1:28 p.m. in Tel Aviv, bringing the loss this year
to 17 percent this year, or 18 percent in dollar terms. The
Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index is down 19 percent this year.  Nasdaq  Companies  Israel, whose population of 7.7 million is similar to
Switzerland’s, has 57 companies traded on the Nasdaq, the most
of any country outside the U.S. after  China . It is also home to
the largest number of startup companies per capita in the world.  Israeli technology companies raised $569 million in capital
during the second quarter of 2011, the most in two years and up
from $343 million in the same period last year, according to the
Israel Venture Capital-KPMG Quarterly Survey released July 13.  Israel’s stock market was upgraded to developed market
status by MSCI Inc. in May 2010, the same month the 63-year-old
country was accepted to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.  The shekel was little changed at 3.6074 against the  U.S.
dollar , after dropping to 3.6211, the weakest level since March.
The currency has lost 1.3 percent versus the dollar over the
past five days, the worst performer among 10 emerging markets in
 Europe ,  Middle East  and  Africa  tracked by Bloomberg.  EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH) , the Israeli maker of network
processors that counts Cisco Systems Inc. as a customer, rose
1.7 percent to $30.95 yesterday. The Tel Aviv shares climbed 0.4
percent to 109.40 shekels, or the equivalent of $30.32, today.  SodaStream International Ltd., the Israeli maker of
machines that turn tap water into soda, rose 4 percent to
$34.91, while Retalix Ltd., a maker of software used by
supermarkets, fell 5.6 percent to $12.99.  To contact the reporter on this story:
