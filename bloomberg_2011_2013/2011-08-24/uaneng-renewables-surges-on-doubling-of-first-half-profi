Huaneng Renewables Corp., a unit of
 China ’s biggest electricity producer, rose the most in 11 weeks
in Hong Kong trading after its first-half profit more than
doubled.  The stock jumped 15 percent, the biggest intra-period
increase since June 10, to HK$2.06, and traded at HK$1.95 at
11:20 a.m. local time. This compares with the benchmark  Hang
Seng Index ’s 1 percent decline.  The China Huaneng Group Corp. unit’s net income climbed to
673.3 million yuan ($105 million) from 291.5 million yuan a year
earlier, according to a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange
yesterday.  Huaneng joins  China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916)  and China
Datang Corp. Renewable Power Co. to report a substantial
increase in profit for the six months ended June 30. Wind-power
companies are expanding production, encouraged by the
government’s goal to have 110 gigawatts of wind capacity by
2015.  Huaneng increased its installed wind-power capacity by 125
percent to 3.7 gigawatts by the end of June from a year earlier,
the company said. Building costs fell, as the average
procurement cost of turbines declined 17 percent in the first
half compared with the same period a year earlier.  “The major factor contributing to such growth is the
strategic location of the company’s wind farms,” said Huaneng.
About 60 percent of its projects are in the northeast of the
country, according to the filing.  The Beijing-based company in June raised HK$6.6 billion
($846 million) from an initial offering in  Hong Kong , the
nation’s second-biggest clean-energy share sale this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
