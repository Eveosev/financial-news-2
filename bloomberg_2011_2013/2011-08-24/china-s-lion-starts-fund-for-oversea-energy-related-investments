Lion Fund Management Co.  aims to
raise more than 3.2 billion yuan ($500 million) in  China  for
investing overseas in energy related products including
exchange-traded funds backed by oil and gas.  The fund, which will be sold from August 29, aims to
“defeat inflation,” Lion Chief Executive Officer Ao Chengwen
said at a briefing today in Beijing. This fund is the first of
its kind in China, according to the company.  Lion received approval to set up the fund under China’s
Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors program that allows
Chinese investors to buy overseas financial assets. The company,
which also manages a fund that invests in gold, has a total
quota for overseas investments of $2 billion.  China, the world’s largest oil user, consumed 439 million
tons of crude last year, of which 236 million tons were imported,
according to data from PetroChina Co. Demand for crude oil in
2015 will exceed 500 million metric tons and top 600 million
tons in 2020, the company said in a presentation on March 31.  --Penny Peng. Editor: John Liu  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
