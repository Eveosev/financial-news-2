The premium European banks pay to
borrow in dollars through the swaps market fell for the second
consecutive day, a sign that funding pressures in the U.S.
currency may be easing.  The cost of converting euro-based payments into dollars, as
measured by the one-year cross-currency basis swap, rose 0.25
basis point to 48.75 basis points below the euro interbank
offered rate, or Euribor, at 11:43 a.m. in  London . The spread
reached 52 basis points yesterday, the most since Dec. 16,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Basis swaps allow investors to borrow in one currency and
simultaneously lend in another. A wider spread signals that
lenders may be facing increasing pressure to raise funds in the
U.S. currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
