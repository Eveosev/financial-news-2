Kenya ’s five-year borrowing costs
rose to the highest since at least May 2006 and 30-year yields
surged to a record at an auction where supply exceeded demand.  The yield on the re-opened 6.671 percent notes due 2015
climbed to 13.887 percent compared with 12.529 percent at the
previous sale on June 22, the Nairobi-based Central Bank of
Kenya said in an e-mailed statement today. The yield on the 12
percent 2041 debt increased to 16.397 percent from 13.52 percent
on March 23. The maturity was first sold February.  The central bank began applying a penalty for lending from
its overnight discount window on Aug. 15, causing the rate to
surge to 17.98 percent on Aug. 18, compared with 6.25 percent
before the new rules came into force. The central bank stopped
publishing the figure as of Aug. 19 and said it would only
reveal the data to borrowers when they are seeking funds.  ‘The market is short of cash; there is very tight
liquidity’’ after the central bank raised the cost of borrowing
from its overnight lending window last week, Fred Moturi, a
fixed-income trader with Nairobi-based Sterling Investment Bank
Ltd., said in a phone interview today. Rising inflation is also
a concern, Moturi said.  The measures were taken to further tighten monetary policy
after inflation accelerated to 15.5 percent in July, more than
triple the government’s 5 percent target, as food and fuel costs
surged. The shilling depreciated to its weakest level in 17
years earlier this month. Kenya’s benchmark three-month
borrowing costs rose to a nine-year high of 9.258 percent on
Aug. 18.  Bonds Undersubscribed  The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee unexpectedly
left the benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 6.25 percent at
its last meeting on July 27, following two consecutive
increases, saying tighter monetary policy won’t reduce supply-
side price pressures.  The central bank of  East Africa ’s biggest economy issued
997.14 million shillings ($11 million) of five-year debt and
2.48 billion shillings of 30-year bonds, having offered 10
billion shillings in total. It received 4.15 billion shillings
of bids for the 2015 notes and 4.55 billion shillings for the
2041 debt, or 87 percent of the amount offered.  The yield on 182-day bills rose to 10.356 percent, the
Central Bank of Kenya said in an e-mailed statement today from
the capital, Nairobi. That’s the highest since May 2002.  Kenyan central bank Governor Njuguna Ndung’u said on Aug.
18 that he’s confident inflation will slow in coming months
after being pushed higher by surging demand for food.  Food prices in Kenya have risen as refugees fled Somalia to
the Dadaab refugee complex in northeastern Kenya, the world’s
biggest such facility with more than 400,000 people. The  United
Nations  has declared a famine in five regions of Somalia and
predicted it may spread across the country’s southern region and
persist until at least December.  To contact the reporters on this story:
