The euro region’s bailout fund won’t
get blanket powers from the German parliament to help indebted
nations, the president of the country’s lower chamber told the
 Handelsblatt  newspaper, denying an earlier report.  Norbert Lammert, a member of the ruling  Christian Democrats 
and parliament’s most senior lawmaker, said a report in the
newspaper today citing plans by Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  to pass parliamentary control over bailouts to the
fund would “definitely not happen.”  Citing a “secret” ministry document, the Handelsblatt
said Schaeuble wants the bailout fund, called the European
Financial Stability Facility, to assume “general powers” to
carry out rescues, sidestepping German budget laws.  German lawmakers have been asked to approve a national bill
to expand the fund’s powers by Sept. 23. Lammert said parliament
would take its cue in deliberations from a Sept. 7 court ruling
on the constitutionality of bailouts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
