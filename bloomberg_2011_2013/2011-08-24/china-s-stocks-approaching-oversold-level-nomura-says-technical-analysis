China’s stocks are approaching
oversold levels after the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index
fell 16 percent from this year’s April 18 high, according to
technical analysis at  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)   The Shanghai Composite, which gained 1.5 percent to
2,554.02 yesterday, may climb to a resistance level of 2,645,
Tacky Cheng, a Hong Kong-based quantitative analyst at Nomura,
said in e-mailed comments yesterday. The 14-day relative
strength index for the stocks gauge declined to 30.28 on Aug. 22
before rebounding to 37.94 yesterday. A reading below 30
indicates it may be poised to rise. A rebound may not last as
the gauge remains in a “downward channel” that may take it to
the levels of 2,461 and 2,392, he said.  “A potential rebound may happen” after the index closed
near oversold levels, Cheng said. “The downward channel is
intact.”  The Shanghai gauge has declined 9 percent this year as the
central bank raised  interest rates  five times and ordered
lenders to set aside more cash as deposit reserves 12 times
since the start of 2010 to contain inflation that quickened to
the fastest pace in three years last month.  In  technical analysis , investors study charts of trading
patterns and prices to predict changes in a security.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
