China ’s yuan advanced toward a 17-
year high after the central bank set the currency’s daily fixing
at the strongest level since July 2005, fueling speculation it
will tolerate further gains to curb inflation.  The  reference rate  was set at 6.3896 per dollar, 0.14
percent stronger than yesterday. The yuan is allowed to trade up
to 0.5 percent either side of the fixing, which is now 0.9
percent higher than at the end of last month. China’s consumer-
price situation in the second half is “not optimistic,”
according to a front-page commentary piece today in the official
People’s Daily. Inflation reached 6.5 percent  in July, the
highest since June 2008, government data show.  “A moderate appreciation in the yuan will help ease the
money inflows from the widening trade surplus,” said  Liu Dongliang , a Shenzhen-based senior analyst at China Merchants
Bank Co., the country’s sixth-largest lender by market value.
The yuan will rise to 6.25 per dollar by the end of this year,
Liu forecast.  The yuan climbed 0.13 percent to 6.3885 per dollar as of
the 4:30 p.m. close in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. It touched 6.3820 on Aug. 16, the
strongest level since the country unified official and market
exchange rates at the end of 1993. In  Hong Kong ’s offshore
market, the currency was little changed at 6.3705.  A preliminary report from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics released yesterday showed the purchasing managers’
index rose to 49.8 in August, compared with 49.3 in July. The
final reading is due early next month. China had a trade surplus
of $31.5 billion in July, the most since January 2009, the
customs bureau said on Aug. 10.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.09 percent
to 6.2868, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The premium
to the onshore spot rate was 1.6 percent.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, James Regan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
