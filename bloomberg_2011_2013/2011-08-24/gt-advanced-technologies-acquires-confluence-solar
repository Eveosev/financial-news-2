GT Advanced Technologies Inc., a
U.S. maker of silicon-production equipment, acquired Confluence
Solar Inc. for $60 million to lower the cost of manufacturing
solar cells.  Closely held Confluence develops technology for producing
high-efficiency monocrystalline silicon ingots, Merrimack, New
Hampshire-based GT Advanced said today in a statement.  Photovoltaic “manufacturers are focusing more closely on
increasing cell efficiency as a way to lower the cost of solar
energy,” GT Advanced’s Chief Executive Officer Tom Gutierrez
said in the statement. Silicon ingots are sliced into wafers
that are made into solar cells.  GT Advanced plans to offer silicon-production systems using
Confluence’s technology in fiscal 2013, which starts in April,
and will eliminate some planned “organic development costs” in
the current fiscal year.  Confluence shareholders, which include the private equity
company Convexa Capital and the South Korean polysilicon
producer OCI Co., will receive an additional $20 million if
certain conditions are met.  To contact the reporter on this story:
