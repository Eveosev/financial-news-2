Bank of Ireland Plc is seeking to
impose a discount of about 60 percent on a group of junior
bondholders spared from an earlier offer two months ago.  The Dublin-based lender on June 28 scrapped an offer to
swap 75 million pounds ($126.7 million) of 13.375 percent
perpetual unsecured bonds for cash or equity after some owners
of the securities had “procedural difficulties.” The bank
offered to pay 40.20 pounds for every 100 pounds owned, it said
in a statement today.  The lender withdrew its original offer two months ago as it
faced a court challenge from an investor contesting the exchange
of the securities, originally sold by the Bristol & West
Building Society in 1991. They became obligations of Ireland’s
biggest bank when it bought the former mutual lender for 600
million pounds in 1997. The bank said June 28 it had resolved
the legal challenge.  Some holders of the notes didn’t hold the minimum amount
required to swap them for new securities rather than cash,
according to Mark Taber, who coordinated the bondholder campaign
against Bank of Ireland. The initial offer applied an 80 percent
discount on bonds exchanged for cash, and 60 percent for those
swapped for equity.  The new offer doesn’t have a debt-for-equity alternative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
