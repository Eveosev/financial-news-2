Chile ’s peso rose for a fourth day
as an increase in copper prices and European equities boosted
risk appetite and countered speculation that the central bank
may soon cut  interest rates .  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 467.06 per  U.S. dollar  at
12:30 p.m. New York time, from 467.34 yesterday.  “Copper is up and so are European stocks and that is
moving the peso,” Sebastian Momberg, a trader at the brokerage
unit of lender Banco de Credito & Inversiones, said today in a
phone interview.  Chile’s central bank may cut rates if a global slowdown
reduces commodity prices and damps growth in the world’s biggest
copper producer, where domestic demand is showing signs of
slowing, central bank President Jose De Gregorio said yesterday
at the Bloomberg Chile Economic Summit in Santiago.  The price of copper, Chile’s main export, rose for a second
day in New York on speculation that demand will be sustained by
growth in China, the top global consumer. Codelco, the world’s
largest producer, plans to invest almost $20 billion on
expansion amid “robust” demand, Codelco Chief Financial
Officer  Thomas Keller  said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
