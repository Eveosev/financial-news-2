Philippine bonds fell, snapping an
eight-day rally, on concern gains have been excessive. The peso
declined.  The yield on the nation’s 10-year notes has dropped 34
basis points this month after official data showed annual
inflation moderated to 5.1 percent in July from 5.2 percent in
June. Trading is winding down ahead of the long weekend,
according to Antonio Espedido, treasurer at China Banking Corp.
in  Manila .  “There’s some selling pressure,” Espedido said. “Yields
are very low. There’s going to be a long weekend and it’s better
to be on the safe side.”  The yield on the 6.5 percent bonds due April 2021 increased
11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 5.97 percent in
Manila, according to prices from the Philippine Dealing &
Exchange Corp. The rate reached 5.86 percent on Aug. 23, the
lowest level since the notes were issued.  Philippine bonds returned 10.6 percent in the past year,
the second-biggest gainers among 10 local-debt indexes tracked
by HSBC Holdings Plc.  The peso weakened 0.3 percent to 42.455 per dollar as of
the 4 p.m. close, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  Local financial markets will be shut on Aug. 29 and 30 for
public holidays.  The  Philippines  may sell 15-year peso bonds to individuals
for the first time to take advantage of the slide in long-term
yields, Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said on Aug. 22.  Central bank Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo expects more
inflows should the  Federal Reserve  add stimulus measures even as
the Philippines’ inflation is “improving.” The Southeast Asian
nation’s foreign-exchange reserves rose to a record $71 billion
in July from $69 billion a month earlier, according to official
data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
