Queens Park Rangers is cutting
season ticket prices a week after AirAsia CEO  Tony Fernandes 
took control of the team.  Supporters of the Premier League club who’ve bought tickets
will receive a “significant” refund, the team said on its
website, without being more specific. There will also be
reductions on match-day tickets, QPR said.  Fernandes is reacting to complaints by fans of the west
London club after prices of season tickets were raised by the
previous owner, Formula One CEO  Bernie Ecclestone , for its first
season in English soccer’s top flight since 1995-96. Prices were
raised as much as 40 percent.  “This is a major step forward in terms of rebuilding the
bond between the club and its supporters,” Jenny Elliott, QPR’s
box office manager, said on the website.  Fernandes’s Tune Group last week bought a 66 percent stake
in QPR from Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore. Financial terms of
the sale weren’t disclosed. The Guardian reported it was worth
35 million pounds ($56 million).  Fernandes has become chairman of QPR Holdings Ltd. with
Amit Bhatia resuming his role as vice-chairman. Bhatia, the son-
in-law of billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, whose family owns the
remaining 33 percent in the club, quit the board earlier this
year because of differences with Ecclestone and Briatore over
ticket prices among other matters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
