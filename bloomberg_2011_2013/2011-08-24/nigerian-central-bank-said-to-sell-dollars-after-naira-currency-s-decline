Nigeria ’s central sold dollars after
the African country’s currency fell to the lowest level in more
than four weeks, two people familiar with the transaction said.  The central bank sold an unspecified amount of dollars,
according to Usman Onoja, chief executive officer of Lagos-based
Lovonus Trust and Investment Ltd., which trades the naira. A
trader at another bank also said the central bank sold the
currency. He asked not to be identified because the transaction
had not been made public.  Central bank spokesman Mohammed Abdullahi didn’t answer his
telephone following calls seeking comment by Bloomberg.  The currency of sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest economy
appreciated by 1.1 percent against the dollar to 154.25 naira at
4:10 p.m. in Lagos, its biggest intraday gain since July 12
sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
