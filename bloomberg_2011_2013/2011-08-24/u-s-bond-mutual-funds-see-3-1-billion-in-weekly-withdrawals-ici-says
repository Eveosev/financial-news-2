U.S. investors put $1.48 billion
into stock  mutual funds  in the week ended Aug. 17, the first
deposits in four months, according to the  Investment Company
Institute .  Customers pulled $3.1 billion from U.S. mutual funds that
buy bonds, the fourth straight week of withdrawals from fixed
income, the Washington-based trade group said today in an e-
mailed statement. U.S. stock funds collected $1.13 billion
during the week ended Aug. 17.  The equity-fund deposits reversed a streak of withdrawals
that accelerated to $30 billion during the previous week, the
most since October 2008, ICI data show. Stocks fell in late July
and the first three weeks of August amid concerns that the
economic recovery is faltering and an unprecedented downgrade of
U.S. credit by  Standard & Poor’s .  The last previous equity deposits came in the week ended
April 20, when $3.05 billion was invested, including $1.92
billion in domestic funds.  The  S&P 500 Index , a benchmark for large-company stocks,
has lost 14 percent since reaching this year’s high on April 29.
The index has advanced 4.8 percent this week, trimming this
year’s decline, as traders speculate that policy makers will
take further steps to stimulate the economy.  Domestic equity funds experienced $9 billion in redemptions
in the first six months of 2011 and may be headed for a record
fifth straight year of withdrawals, ICI data show. All stock
funds, including those that invest outside the U.S., gathered a
net $13.7 billion in deposits in the first half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
