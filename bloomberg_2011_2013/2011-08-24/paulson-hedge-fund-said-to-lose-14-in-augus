John Paulson , the billionaire who is
betting on an economic recovery by the end of 2012, has lost
about 14 percent this month on a merger arbitrage hedge fund,
according to an investor.  The Paulson Partners Enhanced fund declined 11 percent this
year through Aug. 19, said the investor, who asked not to be
named because the information is private. The fund had been up
2.9 percent this year through Aug. 4.  Paulson’s merger-fund losses add to the declines his New
York-based firm, Paulson & Co., has suffered on other
strategies. His largest hedge fund, Paulson Advantage Plus,
dropped 22 percent this month through Aug. 19, bringing its 2011
loss to 39 percent, the investor said.  Paulson, 55, has scaled back bullish bets after losses this
year. His firm last quarter cut its stake in Bank of America
Corp. stock by half and trimmed its Citigroup Inc. holding as
financial shares slumped, and also reduced its investment in
 Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , one of its other large holdings. The
computer maker’s stock has fallen 15 percent since Aug. 18, when
the company agreed to buy software maker Autonomy Corp. for
$10.3 billion.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for Paulson, which manages about
$35 billion, declined to comment on the losses that were
reported earlier today by the Wall Street Journal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
