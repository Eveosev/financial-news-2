Bulgaria will export at least 2
million metric tons of surplus 2011 wheat as the harvest exceeds
last year’s, said Pavel Nikolov, deputy chief of the  National
Grain and Feed Service .  The Balkan country has already sold some 570,000 tons of
wheat, mostly to  Portugal ,  Greece , Cyprus,  Spain  and other
countries in the European Union, Nikolov said in a phone
interview in Sofia today. Farmers have reaped 4.26 million tons
of wheat this year, exceeding last year’s crop of 4 million
tons.  “The yield is higher this year, and the wheat crop is of
much better quality than last year’s because of the better
weather,” Nikolov said. “Wheat shipments are ongoing and will
reach at least 2 million tons.”  Bulgaria has also exported some 260,000 tons of barley to
the EU, even though the crop of about 685,000 tons this year was
below last year’s 833,000 tons, he said.  Bulgaria sold some 1.59 million tons of wheat in 2010,
according to the service. The country’s domestic grain
consumption is about 2 million tons, which allows for further
exports, Nikolov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
