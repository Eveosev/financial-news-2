Iamgold Corp. (IMG)  said it will delist
its shares from the Botswana Stock Exchange as of Sept. 2
because of a lack of liquidity on the bourse.  “The low liquidity in shares traded on the BSE cannot
justify the costs to Iamgold of maintaining a listing,” the
company said in a statement to the exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
