French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
called for an international conference on  Libya  to be held in
Paris on Sept. 1.  Speaking to journalists after a meeting with Libyan
National Transition Council leader Mahmoud Jibril today, Sarkozy
said France is ready to provide medical aid to Libya and will
continue to have a military presence there “as long as our
Libyan friends need it.”  Jibril, speaking through an interpreter, said Muammar Qaddafi’s forces are still shelling parts of Tripoli and other
towns. He said the country will need help to rebuild after the
conflict and called for the release of frozen Libyan assets.  Along with the 40 members of the so-called Contact Group,
Sarkozy also invited China, Russia and  India , according to a
European diplomat who was not authorized to speak publicly about
preparations for the meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
