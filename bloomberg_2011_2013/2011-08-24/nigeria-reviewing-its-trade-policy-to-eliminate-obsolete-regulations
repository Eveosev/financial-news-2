Nigeria is reviewing its trade
policy to remove obsolete regulations and evolve a strategy to
address imbalance in commercial exchanges with other countries,
Trade and Investment Minister Olusegun Aganga said.  “Currently, Nigeria does not have a comprehensive and
coherent trade-policy framework to adequately govern and guide
the nation on domestic and international trade,” Aganga was
quoted as saying in an e-mailed statement today by the ministry.  A draft policy will be ready by November and will come into
effect in January next year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
