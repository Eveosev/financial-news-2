The Egyptian pound advanced the most
in more than six months against the dollar.  The pound climbed 0.3 percent to 5.9592 per dollar at 3:15
p.m. in Cairo, the biggest gain since Feb. 8, when the central
bank said it bought pounds to support the currency against
speculation during the popular uprising that toppled President
 Hosni Mubarak  three days later. The currency earlier fell to
5.9816, the lowest level since January 2005.  Central Bank Governor Farouk El-Okdah and Deputy Governor
Hisham Ramez didn’t answer calls seeking comment.  Egypt ’s international reserves declined more than $10
billion in the first seven months this year to $25.7 billion in
July, according to central bank data. The nation’s default risk
surged 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 409 today,
the highest level since Jan. 31, according to data provider CMA,
which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The yield on the government’s 5.75 percent dollar bond
maturing in April 2020 rose four basis points to 5.56 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
