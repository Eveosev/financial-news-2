The zloty may weaken as the sale of
Polish units by Vattenfall AB signals a decline in foreign
direct investment in Poland, UniCredit SpA said today.  The Italian bank would add to “bearish positions” against
the zloty if the currency appreciates to around 4.10 per euro,
 Gyula Toth , UniCredit’s Vienna-based emerging-market strategist,
wrote in a note to clients. The zloty weakened less than 0.1
percent to 4.1544 versus  Europe ’s common currency as of 12:08
p.m. in Warsaw.  Vattenfall, the Nordic region’s largest utility, yesterday
agreed to sell its Polish power and heating units to Tauron
Polska Energia SA and  Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA (PGN) 
for 7.59 billion zloty ($2.7 billion). Separately, the
government halted plans to raise as much as 6.8 billion zloty
from the sale of a stake in PKO Bank Polski SA, the country’s
biggest lender, citing turmoil on the global markets.  “The deteriorating foreign direct investment backdrop
might weigh on the zloty,” UniCredit said in a note. As the
Vattenfall sale “is from non-residents to residents, the deal
will count as foreign direct investment outflow.”  Poland’s current account deficit, the broadest measure of
money flowing in and out of the country, reached 4.5 percent of
gross domestic product last year, the central bank said on June
29. Foreign direct investment in  Poland  shrank for a third year,
declining to 6.67 billion euros ($9.64 billion) in 2010. They
reached 9.34 billion euros in 2009, according to the  central
bank’s website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
