coalition is considering cutting social security contributions
from 2013,  Bild newspaper  reported, citing unidentified party
leaders.  A further favorable economic environment opens up leeway to
reduce both the health insurance fee and the unemployment
contribution by 0.2 percentage points to 15.3 percent and 2.8
percent respectively, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
