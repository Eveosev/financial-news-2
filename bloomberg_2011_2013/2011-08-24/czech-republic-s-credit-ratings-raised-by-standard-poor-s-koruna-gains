Czech stocks rose the most in a week
and the koruna strengthened after  Standard & Poor’s  lifted its
rating on the country’s debt two notches, citing low debt levels
and a “prudently managed and balanced” economy.  The PX equity gauge rallied 1.6 percent to 1,014.8 at its
4:28 p.m. end of trading in Prague, led by a 4.1 percent jump
for  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , Societe Generale SA’s Czech unit. The
koruna gained 0.5 percent to 24.324 per euro.  S&P lifted the European Union member’s long-term foreign-
currency debt to AA- from A, the company said in a statement
today. That is its fourth-highest grade and puts the country on
par with euro-region Estonia, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The move was prompted by a change in sovereign-rating criteria
that puts more weight on the “political and economic profile”
of central governments, S&P said.  “Our ratings on the  Czech Republic  thus reflect its
prudently managed and balanced economy,” S&P said. “The
economy is characterized by low levels of foreign borrowing, a
deposit-funded banking sector with minimal lending in foreign
currency, and a largely independent central bank that has kept
both consumer-price inflation and interest rates at low
levels.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
