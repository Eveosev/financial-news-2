Belgian business confidence sank in
August to the lowest level since December 2009, driven down by
declining optimism in the business-services sector.  The confidence index for  Belgium  fell to minus 7.8 from
minus 2.5 in July, the National Bank of Belgium in Brussels said
today in an e-mailed statement. Economists expected a drop to
minus 3.5, the median of 14 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  Belgium’s economic growth slowed to 0.7 percent in the
second quarter from 1 percent in the previous period as Europe’s
recovery lost momentum amid government budget cuts and concerns
that the sovereign-debt crisis will spread. The slower growth
may complicate efforts to narrow the  budget deficit  as a
political stalemate has left Belgium without a full-time
government for 14 months.  The central bank’s gauge of confidence in the business-
services sector plummeted to 2.7 in August from 13.9 a month
earlier, today’s report showed. Sentiment in manufacturing fell
to minus 12 from minus 6.2, while the trade figure rose to 5
from 1.2.  The National Bank of Belgium reported last week that
 consumer confidence  declined in August to the lowest in 14
months as households pared their expectations for economic
growth and became less optimistic about their capacity to save.  Borrowing Costs  Europe’s economy is struggling to gather strength as
governments from  Italy  to  Spain  step up budget cuts to fight the
debt crisis. Pledges of 365 billion euros ($525 billion) in
official loans to Greece, Portugal and Ireland, and 110.5
billion euros of bond purchases by the  European Central Bank 
failed to fix the finances of those countries or prevent
speculative attacks on Spain and Italy.  Belgian borrowing costs soared during those attacks. The
premium investors demand to hold Belgian 10-year debt over
German bonds of similar maturity peaked Aug. 4 at 218 basis
points. The spread has since narrowed to 174 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
