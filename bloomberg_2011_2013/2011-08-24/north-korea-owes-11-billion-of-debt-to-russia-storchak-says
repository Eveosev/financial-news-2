North Korea  owes Russia $11 billion
of debt that dates back to the Soviet period and the two
countries have resumed talks to restructure the Asian state’s
liabilities, Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said.  Russia hasn’t lent money to North Korea since the collapse
of the  Soviet Union  in 1991 because the communist state hasn’t
settled its debt, Storchak told reporters at a military base
near Ulan-Ude, a Siberian city close to the border with
Mongolia. North Korea also has yet to recognize Russia as the
successor to the Soviet Union, he said.  Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  agreed on a joint
approach to debt restructuring with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il at their meeting near Ulan-Ude today, said a Kremlin
official, who declined to be identified in line with government
policy.  Russia  and North Korea restarted talks on the issue a
month and a half ago after a long pause, the official said.  The resumption of negotiations is seen as a breakthrough by
the Russian delegation attending today’s meeting, according to
the official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
