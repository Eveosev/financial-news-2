Bonds of  Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (HOV) 
plummeted to the lowest price since they were issued after a
report showed U.S. home prices fell in the second quarter by the
most since 2009.  Hovnanian’s $155 million of 11.875 percent senior unsecured
notes due in October 2015 fell 7 cents to 57 cents on the dollar
at 11:17 a.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the bond price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
The debt, issued Feb. 3, yields 31 percent, Trace data show.  Investors in Hovnanian’s unsecured debt may find their
holdings have “no value” if the company is forced to liquidate
as declining home sales and falling prices hurt its earnings,
according to Vicki Bryan, a bond analyst at Gimme Credit LLC in
New York. The  Red Bank , New Jersey company’s stock has declined
67 percent to $1.37 this year through yesterday, compared with a
7.6 percent loss for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 .  “Hovnanian remains at the top of our worry list with
consistently below-average sales and operating performance,
critically weak liquidity and even weaker asset coverage for its
debt,” Bryan wrote in a note to clients today. The company
doesn’t have “a convincing case for staying power if the
housing market takes years to recover,” she wrote.  Hovnanian’s $797 million of 10.625 percent senior secured
notes climbed 0.25 cent to 86 cents at 11:06 a.m. in New York,
Trace data show. Bondholders may recover 20 to 30 cents on the
dollar less than that if Hovnanian is forced to liquidate, Bryan
wrote.  Yield Premium  The extra yield investors demand to own Hovnanian’s bonds
instead of Treasuries has almost doubled to 18.44 percentage
points on average yesterday from 9.74 percentage points at the
end of 2010, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show.  U.S. home prices fell 5.9 percent in the second quarter
from a year earlier, the biggest decline since 2009, as
foreclosures added to the supply of properties on the market,
according to the Federal Housing Finance Authority. Sales of new
homes slowed to a 298,000 annual pace last month, the least
since February, Commerce Department data shows.  Hovnanian’s net loss for the three months ended April 30
widened to $72.7 million, or 69 cents a share, from $28.6
million, or 36 cents, a year earlier, the company said June 7.
Revenue declined to $255.1 million from $318.6 million a year
earlier.  Jeff O’Keefe, vice president of  investor relations  at
Hovnanian, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
