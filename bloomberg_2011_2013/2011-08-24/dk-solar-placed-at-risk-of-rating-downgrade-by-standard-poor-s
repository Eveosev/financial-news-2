LDK Solar Co., the largest maker of
silicon solar wafers last year, may get its  credit rating  cut by
 Standard & Poor’s  after reducing revenue and gross margin
forecasts.  The Chinese company’s B+ long-term rating was put on S&P’s
CreditWatch with negative implications, S&P said today in a
statement. LDK on Aug. 18 reduced its forecasts for the full
year to a range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion from $3.5
billion to $3.7 billion. The new guidance for revenue and
margins were lower than S&P expected, it said.  The Xinyu-based company’s American depositary shares slid
23 percent on Aug. 19, the day after the forecast cut, compared
with a 7.6 percent drop by the Bloomberg Industries Global Large
Solar Energy index. S&P said today LDK’s financing will be
affected.  “We believe the company’s leverage is likely to rise and
remain high in 2011 because of the lower-than-expected
profitability,” the unit of New York-based McGraw-Hill Cos.
said in the statement.  LDK’s 10 percent notes due Feb. 28, 2014, skidded after the
forecasts were cut. The yield has jumped to 24.9 percent today
compared with 17.8 percent on Aug. 17, according to Bloomberg
composite prices.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
