The cost of protecting debt issued
by Edison Mission Energy jumped to a record high.  Credit-default swaps tied to the company’s debt surged 3.3
percentage points to 36.6 percent upfront, according to data
provider CMA. That’s in addition to 5 percent a year, meaning it
would cost $3.66 million initially and $500,000 annually to
protect $10 million of Edison Mission’s debt.  The contracts have risen to levels that imply 84.9 percent
odds the company will default within five years, up from an 80.8
percent probability yesterday, according to CMA, which is owned
by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. The contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses
on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, decline
as investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
