Naftna Industrija Srbije AD, the
Serbian refining unit olf OAO Gazprom Neft, said first-half net
income rose to 21.4 billion dinars ($302.4 million) as the local
currency strengthened and production increased.  First-half earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization rose 144 percent to 20.5 billion dinars,
company officials said at a news conference in Belgrade today.
Net income, excluding currency effects, for the period was 15.1
billion dinars from 6.2 billion dinars a year ago. NIS imports
most of its supplies.  “The company maintained the trend of rising
profitability,” said Chief Financial Officer Alexey Urusov. In
the second quarter alone, NIS earned 11.6 billion dinars after a
9.8 billion-dinar profit in the first three months.  Sales rose 31 percent to 83.1 billion dinars even as the
volume of oil sold declined 3 percent to 1.14 million tons.  The company owns the only two refineries in  Serbia  as well
as several oil and gas fields. It also has a retail network of
480 fuel stations and depots.  Its share of the retail market fell to 34.4 percent at the
end of June from 37 percent at the end of the first quarter,
reverting to about the same level as a year ago.  NIS’s oil and gas production in Serbia increased 30 percent
to 730 tons of oil equivalent in the first half, Urusov said.
Oil output alone rose 25 percent to 498,000 tons.  Dinar Rate  Risks in the second half of the year include “a potential
decrease in the dinar rate as well as a drop in demand for fuel
on the market as a result of increased prices” if the global
price of oil rises “significantly, Urusov said.  The company decreased its debt to lenders in the second
quarter to $574 million from $632 million at the end of March,
he said. At the end of December, its debt was $611 million.  NIS shares fell 1.42 percent today to 766 dinars. The
stock, which started trading last August, was a record-high 865
dinars on Aug. 3.  Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of  Russia ’s state-controlled gas
producer, bought 51 percent of NIS for 400 million euros in 2009
with a commitment to invest another 500 million euros. It raised
the stake earlier this year to 56.15 percent and Serbia owns
29.88 of the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
