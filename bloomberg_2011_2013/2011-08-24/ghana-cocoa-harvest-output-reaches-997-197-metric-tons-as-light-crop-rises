Cocoa production in  Ghana  during the
2010-11 season has reached 997,197 metric tons after purchases
of beans from farmers during the ongoing light-crop harvest more
than doubled, according to the Ghana Cocoa Board.  In the nine weeks to Aug. 11, purchases increased to 80,393
tons compared with 34,421 in the same period a year earlier,
said Kwabena Asante-Poku, deputy chief executive of the Accra-
based board.  The light, or mid, crop will last for two more weeks and
may produce as much as 10,000 tons, he said in an interview
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
