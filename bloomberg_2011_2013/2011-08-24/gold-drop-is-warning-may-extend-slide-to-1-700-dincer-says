Gold’s drop of as much as 8 percent
from a record yesterday is a warning signal to investors and it
may fall to $1,700 an ounce this week, said Bayram Dincer, an
analyst at LGT Capital Management in Pfaeffikon,  Switzerland .  Gold futures reached a record $1,917.90 in New York
yesterday before erasing the gain and today slumped as much as
5.2 percent to $1,763.80 as increased orders for U.S. durable
goods eroded demand for the metal as a haven asset.  Dincer commented today by e-mail.  “This is a warning signal for gold investors -- that price
moves can be very erratic. Late entry gold investors are exiting
the market and $1,700 is a possibility before” central bankers
from around the world gather on Aug. 26 in  Jackson Hole ,
 Wyoming , Dincer said. The annual meeting last year saw Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke hint at a second round of asset
purchases.  “We expect long-term buyers will still trust in gold and
that only the short-term investors will book profits,” Dincer
said.  The metal will trade between $1,650 and $1,900 in the
fourth quarter, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
