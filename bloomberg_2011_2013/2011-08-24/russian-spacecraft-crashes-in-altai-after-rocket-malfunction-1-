A Russian cargo spacecraft crashed
shortly after take-off following a malfunction in its booster
rocket, Roskosmos, the country’s space agency, said in a
 statement  on its website today.  The Progress craft was carrying 3.5 tons of cargo to the
International Space Station, where it was expected to dock on
Aug. 26, Interfax reported, citing unidentified sources. The
spacecraft crashed in the Altai Republic, north of  Russia ’s
border with  China , about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the
closest residential area, according to the news service.  Next month’s launch of the Soyuz TMA-22 spaceship may be
delayed until the circumstances of today’s crash are determined,
Interfax said. Roskosmos suspended its Proton-M rocket program
yesterday after a faulty launch caused it to lose control of a
satellite. Russia lost an Express-AM4 telecommunications
satellite Aug. 18, while the Vedomosti newspaper reported in
February that a Geo-IK-2 military satellite was also lost.  No injuries have been reported so far around today’s crash
site, an unidentified police representative told Interfax.
Alexei Kuznetsov, head of the space agency’s press service,
didn’t answer five calls to his cell phone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
