Palm oil  dropped for the first time
in three days as a rally to a one-week high prompted some
investors to lock in gains.  The November-delivery contract declined as much as 0.9
percent to 3,041 ringgit ($1,019) per metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and ended the morning trading session at
3,053 ringgit. Futures gained 1.5 percent yesterday to the
highest level at close since Aug. 15.  “We have seen significant gains in the past week, so I
don’t rule out that some profit taking activities will kick
in,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., said
by phone from  Singapore . “I don’t expect sharp movements in the
palm oil market because the market is skeptical and is still not
convinced enough before  Ben Bernanke ’s speech.”  Weaker-than-estimated U.S. economic data reinforced
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will act to support growth,
paving the way for a rebound in U.S. demand. Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and other central bankers will meet
this week in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming. During last year’s
conference, Bernanke signaled a second round of asset purchases,
known as QE2, that buoyed asset markets.  “Last year, he announced QE2 so market participants are
sort of expecting that maybe he will announce or signal some
stimulus package for the  U.S. economy ,” Ker said.  Strong Fundamentals  Palm oil is “trading lower because of a small correction
on the previous rise,” Vimala Reddy, an analyst at Karvy
Comtrade Ltd., said by phone from the Indian city of Hyderabad.
“The fundamentals are very strongly supported,” she said,
citing soybean crop uncertainties in the U.S., lower crop
production and stock levels expected in  Malaysia , and strong
global demand for edible oils.  Soybean crop conditions in the U.S. have deteriorated in
the past two months due to hot and dry weather in the key-
growing regions, government data show.  Palm oil output in Indonesia and Malaysia, the largest
growers, typically falls during the Muslim fasting month of
Ramadan, which began Aug. 1 this year, as laborers work fewer
hours.  Palm oil output in Malaysia slipped 0.1 percent to 1.75
million tons in July, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said on Aug.
10. Stockpiles dropped to 2 million tons in July from 2.05
million tons in June, while exports rose 9.1 percent to a record
1.73 million tons, it said.  The November-delivery soybean contract fell as much as 0.3
percent to $13.9275 per bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The December-delivery  soybean oil  gained as much as 0.6 percent
to 56.54 cents a pound.  Palm oil for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
fell as much as 0.5 percent to 8,898 yuan ($1,393) per ton,
while soybean oil for delivery in the same month retreated as
much as 0.4 percent to 10,134 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
