Treasuries fell, pushing 10-year
note yields to the highest in a week, after a report showed
durable goods orders rose in July more than forecast, renewing
optimism that the U.S. economic recovery may accelerate.  U.S. 30-year bond yields rose the most since Aug. 11 amid
speculation about whether Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will signal if policy makers are willing to take
further measures to prevent the U.S. from returning to recession
when he delivers an Aug. 26 speech at  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming . The
U.S. sold $35 billion in five-year notes at a record low auction
yield before a sale of $29 billion of seven-year notes tomorrow.  “The economy is not dead,” said  William Larkin , a fixed-
income money manager at Salem, Massachusetts-based Cabot Money
Management, which oversees $500 million. “You’ve got all this
fear, but when you get data that says the fear may not be
warranted, like today’s data, you’ll get a pop up in yield.”  Ten-year note yields rose 15 basis points to 2.30 percent
at 5:01 p.m. in  New York , the highest level since Aug. 16,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.125 percent
security due in August 2021 fell 1 9/32, or $12.81 per $1,000
face amount, to 98 14/32.  The yield on the 30-year bond rose 16 basis points to 3.65
percent, the highest since Aug. 17. Yields on the current five-
year note climbed eight basis points to 1.02 percent.  Further Stimulus  “As a lot of the expectations for further stimulus come
out of the market, a lot of the buying we’ve seen on the long
end in anticipation of Fed purchases in that part of the curve
has come off,” said  Richard Bryant , senior vice president in
fixed-income at MF Global Inc. in New York, one of the 20
primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “The growing consensus
is that we may not get an indication of imminent Fed involvement
in the long end on Friday.”  U.S. government securities have surged 3.1 percent this
month, based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch data, as investors
sought the security of debt while stocks tumbled. The MSCI All
Country World Index of stocks has handed investors a loss of
almost 12 percent since the end of July, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Today’s auction yield of 1.029 percent was less than the
previous record low auction yield of 1.260 percent in September
2010 and compared with the average forecast of 1.021 percent in
a Bloomberg News survey of 10 primary dealers.  Bid Pattern  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.71,
compared with 2.62 at the July offering and an average of 2.77
at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 42.1 percent of the notes, versus an
average of 39 percent at the past 10 sales. They bought 36.6
percent at the July auction.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 13.9 percent of
the notes, compared with the 10-auction average of 10.7 percent.  The Treasury sold $35 billion of two-year notes at a record
low yield of 0.22 percent yesterday as investors sought the
shortest, safest assets as a refuge from market turmoil.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices during the life of the debt, was 2.04
percentage points. The spread narrowed to 1.96 percentage points
on Aug. 18, the least since Oct. 13. It has averaged 2.06
percentage points during the past five years.  Durable Goods  Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years rose
4 percent after falling a revised 1.3 percent in June, a
Commerce Department report showed today in  Washington . The
median projection of 81 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
called for a 2 percent gain. Orders minus the volatile
transportation equipment category unexpectedly climbed 0.7
percent.  “People are thinking the worst is behind us,” said
 Michael Franzese , managing director and head of Treasury trading
at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in New York. “Stocks are getting
a feel that Bernanke will be involved in the market.”  The  U.S. budget deficit  is projected to be $1.3 trillion in
the year ending Sept. 30, down from $1.4 trillion forecast in
April because of curbs on federal spending, the  Congressional
Budget Office  said.  The nonpartisan CBO, in its semiannual look at the nation’s
fiscal health, also projected the deficit for the subsequent 12-
month period through Sept. 30, 2012, at $973 billion rather than
the $1.1 trillion forecast in April.  The current rate of inflation, 3.6 percent as measured by
the  consumer price index , means 10-year notes yield negative
1.47 percent after accounting for costs in the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
