Utah Senator  Orrin Hatch  said the
Obama administration hasn’t adequately consulted with Congress
on a plan to reorganize 12 agencies related to U.S. exports.  Hatch, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee,
which oversees trade issues, asked for a meeting with the
administration to discuss the proposal, according to a statement
today from the senator who complained he hasn’t been briefed.  President  Barack Obama  in March directed his administration
to develop a plan to reshape the government that may include
folding the  U.S. Trade Representative ’s office into the Commerce
Department, abolishing some agencies and reducing the workforce.  “I expect to be fully briefed and kept up to date on the
status of any recommendations to reorganize the trade agencies
that fall within our committee’s jurisdiction,” Hatch said in a
letter to Obama. “I am deeply concerned about any proposals to
place the Office of the United States Trade Representative into
any other agency.”  Hatch also urged Obama to send Congress trade agreements
with Colombia, Panama and  South Korea  as a way to increase
competitiveness, while expressing concern that the trade agency
may be folded into another part of an “otherwise bloated
bureaucracy.”  “The solution to America’s trade competitiveness does not
lie in creating a new ‘Department of Jobs’ or a new ‘Department
of Competitiveness,’” Hatch wrote. “It lies in fighting to
aggressively open foreign markets to U.S. exports.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
