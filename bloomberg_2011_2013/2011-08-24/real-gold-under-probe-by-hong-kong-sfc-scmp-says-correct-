(Corrects spelling of Hong Kong in headline.)  Real Gold Mining Ltd. (246)  is under
investigation by Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission,
South  China  Morning Post reported, citing court documents.  The commission obtained warrants to search the company’s
premises on July 5 and 6, the report said.  The probe was revealed in a writ filed by Real Gold against
the commission in Hong Kong  High Court  yesterday, saying the
regulator may have obtained files protected by “lawyer-client
privilege,” the newspaper said.  Several calls to Real Gold’s Hong Kong and China offices
made before business hours went unanswered. A message left at
Esther Lau of Strategic Financial Relations (China) Ltd., Real
Gold’s public relations company, was not returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
