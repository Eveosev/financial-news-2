Gold rebounded from its biggest drop
since February 2010 in London as concern about slowing economic
growth and debt crises boosted demand for the metal as a
protection of wealth. Bullion futures fell in  New York .  Gold touched a record $1,913.50 an ounce yesterday before
plunging as some investors sold the metal after its gain and as
global equities rallied. Moody’s Investors Service cut  Japan ’s
credit rating, while a report showed German business confidence
fell to the lowest level in more than a year. German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  rejected a call to put up gold as security for
bailouts, reflecting euro-area divisions.  “We’ve seen a bit of bargain-hunting and people are happy
to buy” after yesterday’s drop, Bernard Sin, head of currency
and metal trading at bullion refiner MKS Finance SA in Geneva,
said by phone today. “People are still very concerned. One of
the only avenues still open is gold.”  Immediate-delivery gold rose $17.47, or 1 percent, to
$1,845.82 an ounce by 1:01 p.m. in  London . It slid 3.6 percent
yesterday and is up 30 percent this year. Gold for December
delivery was down 0.7 percent at $1,848.40 on the Comex in New
York after touching a record $1,917.90 yesterday. Futures spiked
about $28 at yesterday’s settlement, Bloomberg data show.  Bullion fell to $1,850 an ounce in the morning “fixing”
in London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,876 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  Stocks vs. Gold  The metal is in the 11th year of a  bull market , the longest
winning streak since at least 1920 in London, as investors seek
to diversify their holdings away from equities and some
currencies. Gold’s 120-day correlation with the MSCI All-Country
World Index of stocks fell to -0.76 today, the lowest level
since May 2008. A figure of -1 means they move in opposite
directions all the time.  Merkel rejected demands that  Greece  provide collateral for
emergency loans as splits emerged in her Cabinet. She said a
call by Labor Minister Ursula von der Leyen for countries to put
up gold as security for bailouts is “not the right way.” The
disagreement underscores risks over a second Greek aid package
after the Finnish government said Aug. 16 it secured a
collateral arrangement to ensure its contribution would be
repaid.  Central bankers from around the world gather on Aug. 26 in
 Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , for an annual meeting that last year saw
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke hint at a second round
of asset purchases. That’s created speculation the Fed may
bolster the economy again at this meeting.  ‘Well Bid’  “Gold is very well bid every time prices come off,” said
Duan Shihua, head of corporate services at Haitong Futures Co.
in  Shanghai . “This will keep prices supported as investors
continue to look for a safe place to put their money.”  Exchange-traded-product holdings fell for a third day
yesterday and the most since January, sliding 24.8 metric tons
to 2,181.6 tons, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Assets reached
a record 2,216.8 tons on Aug. 8.  Silver for immediate delivery was little changed at
$41.9375 an ounce after yesterday touching $44.25, the highest
price since May 3. It’s up 36 percent this year.  Platinum was up 0.4 percent at $1,869.60 an ounce. It
yesterday reached $1,916.75, the highest price since July 2008.
Palladium was little changed at $761.75 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
