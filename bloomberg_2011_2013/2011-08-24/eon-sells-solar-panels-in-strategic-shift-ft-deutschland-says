EON AG shifted strategy and began
selling solar panels to private customers after Germany decided
to phase out nuclear  power plants , the  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing Uwe Kolks, who heads the utility’s
solar business.  While the solar unit is aimed at improving EON’s public
image, it must earn money and will communicate sales targets in
the fourth quarter, the newspaper cited Kolks as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
