(Corrects to say borrow in third paragraph.)  The rate banks charge to lend to
each other in Swiss francs for three months, or Libor, dropped
to a record low 0.00667 percent, the British Bankers’
Association said.  Credit Suisse AG, the Zurich-based bank, submitted a
negative three-month Libor for a fifth day, unchanged at minus
0.15 percent, BBA data show. Citigroup Inc. submitted a rate
below zero for the third day, unchanged at negative 0.05
percent.  Societe Generale SA, the third lender to submit a negative
rate, offered to borrow at minus 0.03 percent today, compared
with negative 0.01 percent yesterday.  The  Swiss National Bank  lowered its target for three-month
franc Libor to “as close to zero as possible” on Aug. 3 as it
attempts to restrain the currency’s appreciation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
