Soco International Plc (SIA) , an oil
explorer in Asia and  Africa , may buy back shares to bolster the
price after a 21 percent drop this year, Chief Financial Officer
Roger Cagle said.  “We’re off in line with everyone else,” Cagle said in a
telephone interview. “We’ll have a board meeting soon and I
expect one of the topics of discussion will be a share
buyback.”  Soco’s Te Giac Trang field off the coast of  Vietnam  started
production this month and may increase output to more than
50,000 barrels of oil a day by the end of the year, bolstering
cash flow, it said in a statement today. The company also plans
to drill three wells off Congo starting this month.  Soco rose 3.2 percent to 294 pence as of the 4:30 p.m.
close in London.  The TGT field alone can generate over $500 million in  cash
flow  with  oil prices  at $70 a barrel, and Soco’s share-price
decline this year was probably due to the falling market, Cagle
said. The FTSE 350 oil and gas producer index has slipped 12
percent this year.  “With markets acting as they are, being financially strong
is a good position to be in,” Cagle said. “We’re sitting on
$213 million in cash and it’s going to be a steady ramp-up.”  Profit after tax in the first six months of the year rose
to $6.8 million from $3.7 million in 2010, the company reported
today. Capital expenditure increased to $65 million from $51.6
million in the period.  “We’ve never gone back to shareholders to ask for more
money for drilling,” Cagle said. “We’ll keep that record.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
