U.S. stock futures fell, indicating
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will decline after yesterday’s
biggest advance in a week, before data that may show companies
are ordering less equipment as economic growth slows.  S&P 500  futures expiring in September declined 0.5 percent
to 1,152.5 at 10:21 a.m. in London. Futures on the Dow Jones
Industrial Average lost 63 points, or 0.6 percent, to 11,078.  The S&P 500 rallied 3.4 percent to 1,162.35 yesterday, its
largest rally since Aug. 11, on optimism that the Federal
Reserve will take steps to boost the world’s biggest economy.  “There may be some disappointment with QE3 expectations,”
Anthony Crescenzi, executive vice president and strategist at
Pacific Investment Management Co. said on Bloomberg Television’s
“First Up” with Susan Li. Pimco oversees $1.34 trillion in
 Newport Beach , California. “The Fed doesn’t have a lot of
ammunition left. It could announce some options that are on the
table, but to expect implementation of it to occur quickly
probably is the wrong bet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
