China ’s benchmark money-market rate
fell by the most in three weeks on speculation that the
availability of cash is improving after GD Power Development Co.
concluded a debt sale.  The Beijing-based company sold 5.5 billion yuan ($860
million) of six-year convertible bonds on Aug. 19, according to
a statement on the Shanghai stock exchange late yesterday.
Subscriptions for the issue likely totaled as much as 45 times
the amount sold, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  “Liquidity close to 200 billion yuan to 250 billion yuan
was locked up,” said Linan Liu, a Greater China interest-rate
strategist at Deutsche Bank in  Hong Kong . “The money will be
released today and tomorrow, so this is why liquidity is getting
better.”  The seven-day repurchase rate dropped 82 basis points, or
0.82 percentage point, to 4.38 percent as of 10:02 a.m. in
 Shanghai , according to a weighted average compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center. That was the biggest drop
since Aug. 4. It touched 5.21 percent yesterday, the highest
level since July 25.  The People’s Bank of China kept the yield on one-year bills
unchanged at 3.5840 percent at a sale of 3 billion yuan of the
securities yesterday. The monetary authority boosted yields on
its three-month, one- and three-year bills last week.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined four
basis points to 3.79 percent in Shanghai, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
