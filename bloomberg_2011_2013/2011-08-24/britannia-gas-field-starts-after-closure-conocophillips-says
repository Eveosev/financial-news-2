(Corrects operators in third paragraph.)  The North Sea Britannia natural-gas
field is returning to operation after planned maintenance, the
platform’s operator said.  “Britannia is currently in the process of coming back
online,” Sandra Duncan, a spokeswoman for  ConocoPhillips (COP)  in
Aberdeen,  Scotland , said today by e-mail.  Britannia, one of the U.K.’s biggest gas fields, pumps the
fuel into Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Sage plant at St. Fergus terminal
42 miles (68 kilometers) northeast of Aberdeen. A joint venture
between ConocoPhillips and Chevron Corp. operates the field.  Along with its satellite fields Brogdar and Callansih,
Britannia produced an average of about 12 million cubic meters a
day last year, data from the U.K. Department of Energy and
Climate Change show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
