South Africa  will not be able to
expand its economy and create employment for young people on its
current trajectory, Business Day reported, citing National
Planning Minister  Trevor Manuel .  The country could face its own Arab Spring if changes are
not made, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited Manuel as
saying.  Strike activity was hampering growth and not contributing
to much needed job creation, Business Day quoted Manuel as
saying, while South Africa also needed to attract more foreign
investment to spur growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
