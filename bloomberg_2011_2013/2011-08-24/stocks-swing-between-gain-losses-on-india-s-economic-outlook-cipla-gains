Indian stocks dropped for the first
time this week on concern measures taken by the central bank to
curb price increases have started to cool demand and hurt
corporate earnings.  Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the world’s biggest producer, fell the
most in six weeks. The  Reserve Bank of India  is watching for
signs of any slowdown in demand as it seeks to tame “inflation
drivers” that are “very much in play,” Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said yesterday.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the
largest software services exporter, led a decline among peers.  “There’s further downside to the Sensex earnings-per-share
target,” Rakesh Arora, head of research at Macquarie Capital
Securities (India) Pvt., said in an interview with Bloomberg
UTV. Arora expects companies on the measure to report earnings
of 1,160 rupees to 1,170 rupees a share in the year to March 31,
compared with a previous estimate of 1,200 rupees. He correctly
predicted in July that the gauge would decline 10 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
213.49 points, or 1.3 percent, to 16,284.98 at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock
Exchange declined 1.2 percent to 4,888.90 and its August futures
settled at 4,869.30. The BSE-200 Index fell 1.1 percent.  India ’s central bank policy makers expect the country’s
growth to slow to 8 percent in the year to March 31, from an
estimated 8.5 percent in the previous 12 months, as inflation
erodes spending power and 11 rate increases since March 2010
hurt corporate profits. The nation’s economy has grown at an
average pace of 8.6 percent since 2006, compared with  China ’s
9.8 percent during the period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  CLSA Cut  The Sensex has retreated 22 percent from a Nov. 5 peak,
exceeding the 20 percent level marking a so-called  bear market 
for some investors. Companies on the measure are valued at 13.6
times estimated earnings, down from 21.5 times last March. The
MSCI Emerging Markets Index trades at a multiple of 9.6 times.  CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets lowered its target on the Sensex
to 18,200 from 19,500, according to a note today.  “While the sharp correction in the market may suggest
attractive valuations, we note that the pace of corporate
earnings downgrades has intensified in the recent results
season,” CLSA analysts led by Mahesh Nandurkar wrote.  Earnings for 46 percent of Sensex companies missed analyst
estimates in the quarter ended June 30, according to Bloomberg
data. That compares with 33 percent that lagged forecasts in the
previous quarter.  Reserve Bank  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said Aug. 12 that
it’s “too early to say” whether India’s policy stance to raise
borrowing costs will be changed. The central bank meets on Sept.
16 to review policy.  Benchmark wholesale-price inflation in July climbed 9.22
percent from a year earlier after a 9.44 percent jump in June.  State Order  Coal India tumbled 4.7 percent to 373.9 rupees and its
August futures settled at 371.65 rupees. The stock’s surge 18
percent surge this year is the best among Sensex companies. The
pollution control board of India’s Jharkhand state has ordered a
unit of the miner to close 22 open cast and underground mines,
 Press Trust of India  reported yesterday.  Tata Consultancy slid 1.9 percent to 962.6 rupees and
larger rival Infosys Ltd. fell 1.1 percent to 2,250.9 rupees.
 Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , the third-biggest software services provider, shed
0.9 percent to 329.85 rupees. India’s largest software exporters
get at least 80 percent of their sales from abroad.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the biggest truckmaker and owner of
Jaguar Land Rover, fell 3.7 percent to 700.75 rupees. The stock
has dropped 46 percent this year and is the worst performer on
the 30-member Sensex. Morgan Stanley yesterday cut its earnings
estimate for the year through March 2012 by 30 percent, citing a
“deteriorating global macro environment.”  Earnings Estimate  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the largest carmaker, decreased
3.2 percent to 1,114.5 rupees and its August futures settled at
1,116 rupees. Kotak Institutional Equities today lowered its
price target on the stock to 1,475 rupees from 1,515 rupees and
cut its earnings estimates by 3 percent to 9 percent.  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the nation’s biggest lender, plunged
3.6 percent to 1,989.75 rupees and its nearest rival  ICICI Bank
Ltd. (ICICIBC)  shed 1.2 percent to 842.2 rupees.  Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB) , the
fourth-largest lender by market value, dropped 3.1 percent to
1,049.7 rupees. Indian banks need “substantial capital” to
support the nation’s economic growth, central bank’s Sinha said.  A drop in regional equities also contributed to today’s
fall. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank 1.2 percent as investors
weighed what the  Federal Reserve  will do to bolster the economy.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and other central bankers meet
this week in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, amid signs of a slowing U.S.
recovery. Data today showed German business confidence fell to
its lowest in more than a year, while a report may show U.S.
business-equipment demand declined. Moody’s Investors Service
cut  Japan ’s credit rating by one step, saying “weak” prospects
for growth will make it difficult to tackle public debt.  Foreign investors have sold $1.8 billion of equities this
month, set for the worst monthly outflow since May 2010, as
higher borrowing costs weighed on company earnings and the
government curbed its decision making amid corruption scandals.  Overseas investors sold a net 7.66 billion rupees ($167
million) of Indian equities on Aug. 22, paring their investment
in stocks this year to 18 billion rupees, according to data on
the website of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  To contact the reporters on this story:
