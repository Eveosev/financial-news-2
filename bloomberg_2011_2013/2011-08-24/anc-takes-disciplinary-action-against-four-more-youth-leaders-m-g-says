South Africa ’s ruling African
National Congress has taken disciplinary steps against another
four top officials of the party’s Youth League, the Mail &
Guardian reported, citing unidentified members of the group.  Ronald Lamola, deputy president of the league, Sindiso
Magaqa, secretary general, his deputy Kenetswe Mosenogi and
treasurer-general Pule Mabe have been accused of undermining the
ANC for their statements calling for regime change in Botswana,
the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  The ANC said last week it’s taking disciplinary action
against ANC Youth League leader  Julius Malema  and spokesman
Floyd Shivambu for bringing the party into disrepute.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
