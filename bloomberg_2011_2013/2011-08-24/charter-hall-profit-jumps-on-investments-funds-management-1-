Charter Hall Group (CHC) , an Australian
real estate investment trust, plans to create new unlisted funds
and at least two single-asset syndicates to meet rising demand
for alternatives to listed funds.  “We expect to grow our third-party mandate business over
the next 12 months,” said David Harrison, joint managing
director of the Sydney-based company. “We expect to roll out
more single-asset syndicates to retail investors and continue to
look at other funds that may appeal to that sector.”  Charter Hall today reported net income of A$52.3 million
($54.7 million) in the year ended June 30, from A$6.8 million a
year earlier. The group’s earnings from its property investment
business rose 33 percent, and income from its property funds
management and development investment division were close to
three times last year’s.  Charter Hall will continue to seek partners to expand its
development investment business, looking for office and
residential projects, Harrison said. It will also seek office,
retail and industrial properties to acquire, primarily off
market, he said.  The group’s shares climbed 5 percent to A$1.68 as of the
4:10 p.m. close of trade in Sydney, paring this year’s decline
to 32 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
