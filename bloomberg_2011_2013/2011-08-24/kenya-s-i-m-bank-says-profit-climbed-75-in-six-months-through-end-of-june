I&M Bank Ltd., a Kenyan lender that
is partly owned by the French Development Agency and the German
Investment & Development Co., said profit in the six months
through June climbed 75 percent as earnings from loans grew.  The lender, which is 21.7 percent owned by the two
development finance institutions, said net income climbed to
1.69 billion shillings ($18.2 million) from 968.1 million a year
earlier. Net interest income, the money the bank earns from
loans, rose to 2.65 billion shillings from 1.69 billion
shillings a year earlier, it said today in a statement published
in Nairobi-based Daily Nation newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
