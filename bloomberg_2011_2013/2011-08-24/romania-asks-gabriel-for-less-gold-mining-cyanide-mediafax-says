Romania ’s Environment Minister
Laszlo Borbely asked  Gabriel Resources Ltd. (GBU)  to lower its
proposed cyanide level in a tailing pond at its Rosia Montana
gold-mine project, which is currently under assessment for
environmental approval,  Mediafax  reported.  Romania asked the Canadian company to reduce the cyanide
level to below its proposed five parts-per-million
concentration, which is half of the European Union’s maximum
allowed level, and that he aims to conclude talks on the level
in two to three weeks, the Bucharest-based news service  quoted
Borbely as saying  yesterday.  The ministry also asked the company to set aside about $160
million in environmental guarantees in the first years of
development, said Mediafax. Dragos Tanase, the head of Rosia
Montana Gold Corp., said that the company is studying the
ministry’s demands to look for a solution to lower the maximum
proposed level, according to Mediafax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
