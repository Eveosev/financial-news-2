AES Tiete SA (GETI3) , the Brazilian unit of
 AES Corp. (AES) , was ordered by a court in Sao Paulo to boost its
power-generating capacity after it failed to meet the terms of a
1999 privatization accord.  The company has 60 days to present a new investment
proposal or it will face a fine of 30,000 reais ($18,800) per
day, Sao Paulo’s state government said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement, citing a court ruling.  As part of the accord to privatize the company in 1999, AES
Tiete agreed to expand its generating plants by 15 percent and
add 400 megawatts by 2008, according to the statement. Duke
Energy Corp.’s local unit was also ordered to boost capacity in
 Brazil  under a similar ruling on Aug. 11, the statement said.  A spokeswoman for AES Tiete didn’t immediately return a
call and an e-mail from Bloomberg News seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
