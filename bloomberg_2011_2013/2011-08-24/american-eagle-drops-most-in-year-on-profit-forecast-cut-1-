American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO) , the
Pittsburgh-based teen apparel chain, sank 8.8 percent, the most
in 15 months, after lowering its full-year profit forecast as
higher costs for cotton will reduce margins.  American Eagle declined $1.02 to $10.60 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading for the largest drop since
May 26, 2010. Shares have fallen 28 percent this year.  Profit will be 85 cents to 95 cents a share, American Eagle
said today in a statement. That’s down from a previous
projection in May of $1.02 a share. Analysts projected 93 cents,
the average of 26 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  American Eagle has “tempered” sales expectations for the
second half, according to the statement. The company, along with
other retailers, is contending with higher materials costs.  “The lack of an economic recovery has created a
persistently challenging retail environment,” Chief Executive
Officer James O’Donnell said today on a conference call.  Second-quarter net income from continuing operations fell
to $19.7 million, or 10 cents a share, from $25.8 million, or 13
cents, a year earlier. Analysts’ projected 11 cents, the average
of 26 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Same-store sales, a key
indicator of growth because new and old stores are excluded,
were little changed last quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
