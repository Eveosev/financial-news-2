Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s
largest oil company, is selling its second exploration asset in
Brazil’s  Santos Basin  in two months as part of plans to focus on
the country’s Parque das Conchas area.  QGEP Participacoes SA, a unit of Brazilian engineering and
construction company Queiroz Galvao SA, agreed to buy Shell’s 30
percent stake in the BS-4 block for an undisclosed amount, QGEP
said in a statement today. The sale, which needs approval from
Brazilian regulators, includes the Atlanta and Oliva finds.  Shell is selling exploration areas with no production in
Brazil as it plans to add wells at Parque das Conchas to keep
output stable. The project in deep waters of the southeastern
Campos Basin produced 90,000 barrels a day of oil and natural
gas in June.  Shell sold a 20 percent stake in the deep-water BM-S-8
license in July to QGEP and Barra Energia, a Rio de Janeiro-
based oil startup. It also plans to sell stakes in the BM-S-45
and BM-ES-28 offshore blocks as part of a sale plan it announced
last year.  Shell’s partners at BS-4 are  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and state-
controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA. Chevron would consider
selling its stake in the block if it gets an offer, Ali Moshiri,
Chevron’s head of exploration and production for Africa and
Latin America, said in a Jan. 13 interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
