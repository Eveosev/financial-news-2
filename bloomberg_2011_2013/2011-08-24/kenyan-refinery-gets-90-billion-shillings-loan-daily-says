Kenya Petroleum Refineries Ltd.
received a bank loan of 90 billion shillings ($971 million),
 Business Daily  said, citing Managing Director Bimal Mukherjee.  The money will be used to upgrade the companyâ€™s 50-year-old
fuel processor, the Nairobi-based newspaper said. The
improvements will reduce the cost of refining oil and increase
liquefied petroleum gas production, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
