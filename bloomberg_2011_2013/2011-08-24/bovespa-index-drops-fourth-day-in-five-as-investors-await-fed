The Bovespa stock index fell for the
fourth day in five as investors considered what the U.S. Federal
Reserve may do to support the economic recovery, and after
European industrial orders unexpectedly declined in June.  The gauge slid 0.4 percent to 53,576.50 at 9:27 a.m.  New
York  time. The real weakened 0.4 percent to 1.6027 per U.S.
dollar.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and other central bankers meet
on Aug. 26 in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , for an annual conference.
At last year’s meeting, Bernanke signaled that the Fed would
start a second round of asset purchases, known as QE2, that
boosted stock markets.  “Investors are looking for any short-term catalyst they
can point to, so they’re hoping Bernanke, the Fed, can supply
what’s needed,”  Ed Kuczma , who helps manage $30 billion at Van
Eck Associates in New York, said in a phone interview. “On a
macro level, investors in Brazil are still looking at inflation
with reduced expectations for global growth.”  Brazil ’s central bank is scheduled to start its two-day
policy meeting on Aug. 30. Policy makers lifted the benchmark
rate 1.75 percentage points this year to 12.5 percent to curb
annual inflation that quickened to a six-year high of 7.1
percent in mid-August.  European area industrial orders unexpectedly fell in June,
data published by the European Union’s statistics office today
show. Orders slipped 0.7 percent after rising 3.6 percent in
May.  Bear Market  The Bovespa entered a bear market on July 27 after plunging
20 percent from its bull-market peak in November. The measure
extended that drop to 26 percent through yesterday.  The Bovespa trades at 8.8 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, the lowest since March 2009, according to weekly data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of 11.7 for the
Shanghai Composite Index, 5.7 for  Russia ’s Micex and 13.6 for
India’s Sensex.  Traders moved 5.82 billion reais ($3.63 billion) in stocks
in Sao Paolo yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares to a daily average this year of 6.46 billion reais
through Aug. 10, according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
