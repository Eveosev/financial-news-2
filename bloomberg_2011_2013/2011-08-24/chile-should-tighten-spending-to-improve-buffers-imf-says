Chile should accelerate the pace of
fiscal tightening to give it the funds to face a possible
downturn in the global economy, the International Monetary
Fund’s executive board said.  Chile’s gross domestic product will grow an estimated 6.5
percent this year and 5 percent in 2012, the Washington-based
lender said in the report published on its website today. The
government will post a budget surplus equivalent to 1.3 percent
of GDP this year and 1.8 percent in 2012, the IMF said.  Rebuilding “fiscal buffers” at a faster pace than
currently planned would improve stability as a potential
slowdown in  Asia  and intensification of the global financial
crises threaten the South American country’s economy, the fund
said.  “Greater fiscal restraint would help guard against upside
inflation risks and improve the policy mix,” the IMF said. “In
the long term, larger fiscal buffers will help preserve the
government’s ability to respond to adverse shock.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
