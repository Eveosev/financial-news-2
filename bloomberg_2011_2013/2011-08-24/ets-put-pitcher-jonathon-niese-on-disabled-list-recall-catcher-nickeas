The  New York Mets  placed pitcher
Jonathon Niese on the disabled list with a strained rib muscle
on his right side.  The Major League Baseball team said in a news release that
it also recalled catcher Mike Nickeas from its Triple-A farm
team in Buffalo,  New York .  Niese, 11-11 with a 4.40 earned run average this season,
was injured while swinging a bat on Aug. 16 and aggrevated the
condition in last nightâ€™s loss to the  Philadelphia Phillies .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
