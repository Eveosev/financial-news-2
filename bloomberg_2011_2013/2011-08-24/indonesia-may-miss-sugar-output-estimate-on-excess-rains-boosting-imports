Indonesia,  Southeast Asia ’s largest
sugar buyer, may produce less sweetener this year than an
earlier forecast after excess rains lowered the yields,
according to an industry group.  Refined-sugar output in the year that began on May 1 will
be less than the 2.58 million metric tons estimated by the
Indonesian Sugar Council on July 21, Secretary Bambang Priyono
said in a phone interview in Jakarta today. The council plans to
lower its estimate in September, he said. Output was 2.3 million
tons in 2010.  Reduced domestic supplies may force Indonesia to boost
imports to bridge a shortage, potentially supporting a 53
percent rally in raw-sugar prices in  New York  in the past year.
Demand in the world’s fourth-most populous nation will total 5.2
million tons this year, according to the industry ministry.  Indonesia  is likely to import more raw sugar than refined
variety to meet demand, Colosewoko, a senior adviser at the
Indonesian Sugar Association, said today. The country may buy
2.84 million tons, up from 2.48 million tons the previous year,
Faruk Bakrie, chairman of the association, said on Aug. 15.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery fell as much as 0.6
percent to 30.65 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
White sugar for October delivery was little changed at $800.90 a
ton on NYSE Liffe in  London .  Indonesian farmers planted cane across 453,000 hectares
(1.12 million acres) of land this year, up 5 percent from a year
earlier, said Colosewoko, who uses only one name.  La Nina  “We still see the impact from last year’s rain” on
production, Priyono said. A longer than usual rainy season
caused by the La Nina weather pattern damaged crops including
coffee, cocoa and sugar late last year.  Mills produced 1.3 million tons of sugar by July 31 and
crushing will conclude in early November, Priyono said. Sugar
mills in Java, the main producing island, crushed an average
4,000 tons of cane a day this season, down from 5,000 tons in
normal conditions because of heavy rains, Colosewoko said.  “Producers can only work normally during the dry season,
if it is too wet it will reduce the extraction rate,” he said.  Indonesia’s sugar inventories reached 730,000 tons at the
end of July and may rise to between 800,000 tons and 900,000
tons by year end, Colosewoko said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
