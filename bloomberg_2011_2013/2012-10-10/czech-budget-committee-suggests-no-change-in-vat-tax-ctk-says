The Czech parliamentary budget
committee today proposed an amendment to the government’s tax-
increase proposal that would keep the value-added tax rates at
14 percent and 20 percent, the CTK newswire reported.  The government wants to raise the sales tax rates to 15
percent and 21 percent from 2013. Parliament doesn’t have to
take the committee’s proposal into consideration when holding a
final reading of the draft, CTK said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
