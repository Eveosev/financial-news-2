Amarin Corp. (AMRN) , maker of the blood-fat
drug Vascepa, fell the most in two weeks after the company said
U.S. regulators hadn’t determined whether to grant the medicine
five-year marketing exclusivity.  Amarin dropped 5.6 percent to $11.20 at the close in New
York, for the biggest decline since Sept. 24. The Dublin-based
company’s American depositary receipts have increased 50 percent
this year.  Vascepa, which aims to reduce high levels of triglycerides
that can contribute to heart attack and stroke, was approved in
July. The  Food and Drug Administration  still hasn’t decided
whether to grant the drug “new chemical entity” marketing
exclusivity, Amarin said in a  regulatory filing , citing a
conversation yesterday with the regulator.  “While Amarin continues to believe its arguments in
support of an NCE determination for Vascepa are strong, the FDA
may not agree with Amarin’s arguments,” the company said in the
filing. “Amarin can make no assurance that Vascepa will be
granted NCE exclusivity, or that the FDA will make a
determination in a timely manner.”  Amarin said it expects to get three-year marketing
exclusivity if the FDA decides against five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
