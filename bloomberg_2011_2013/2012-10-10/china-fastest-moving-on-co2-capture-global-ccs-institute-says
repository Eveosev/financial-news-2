China , which is developing more than
half of the carbon-capture and storage projects announced within
the last year, is quickly becoming a leader in deployment of
systems to cut emissions from power plants, according to the
Global CCS Institute.  Currently there are 75 carbon-capture and storage, or CCS,
projects in development worldwide compared with 74 a year ago,
Brad Page, chief executive officer of the institute, said today
on a media call. Nine were newly identified, including  five  in
China, and eight were canceled or put on hold, he said.  “China is the fastest-moving nation now on CCS,” Page
said. The country “has moved very rapidly from right down in
the bottom of our league tables to now being number three in the
world in terms of number of projects,” he said. The U.S. and
 Canada  have the most projects.  Chinese companies are beginning to participate in projects
in other countries, and that is a trend that may continue, Page
said. China Petrochemical Corp., Asia’s biggest refiner that’s
known as Sinopec Group, last month won an engineering contract
for Summit Power Group LLC’s CCS project in  Texas .  “That may well turn out to be just a sign of things to
come,” Page said. “It’s a very important development.”  The Global CCS Institute is based in Canberra,  Australia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
