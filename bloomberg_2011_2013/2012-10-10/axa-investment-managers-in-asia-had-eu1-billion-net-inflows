Axa Investment Managers , a unit of
 Europe ’s second-largest insurer, had about 1 billion euros
($1.29 billion) in net inflows this year in the Asia-Pacific
region, excluding Japan, said Jean-Pierre Leoni, who oversees
the business in the area.  The inflows were driven by Taiwan and Korea, Leoni told
journalists at a meeting in Paris today. Still, Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis is pushing Asian clients to seek “the
lowest price” for investments in European assets, leaving Axa
Investment Managers below its goal of 2 billion euros of net
inflows in the region this year, the executive said.  Axa Investment Managers,  Axa SA (CS) ’s Paris-based asset-
management unit, has about 20 billion euros under management and
260 staff at seven locations in Asia-Pacific markets excluding
 Japan , according to a presentation handed to journalists.  The unit said in a  May 16 statement  that it opened a
representative office in Beijing “to perform market research
and build on relationships with Chinese institutional
investors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
