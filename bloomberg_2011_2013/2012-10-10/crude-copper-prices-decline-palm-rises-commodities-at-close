for global demand citing slowing growth in  China , the world’s

ahead of French and Italian industrial data due today that may

euro and demand for the precious metal.  Spot gold fell as much as 0.2 percent to $1,760.85 an ounce
and traded at $1,761.93 at 2:05 p.m. in Singapore. The metal

products rose to a record 2,582.43 tons yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Palm oil  advanced for a second day to the highest level in
more than a week after  Malaysia , the second-biggest producer,
signaled that it may reduce a tax on exports after prices
slumped to a three-year low last week.  The December-delivery contract rose as much as 1.9 percent

Oct. 1, and was at 2,480 ringgit at 4:09 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur .
Futures fell on Oct. 2 to the lowest close since November 2009
as stockpiles climbed and demand cooled. Official data released
today showed Malaysian reserves at an all-time high last month.  Rubber fell to the lowest close in more than a week on
concern that the debt crisis in Europe and weaker vehicle sales
in China will weaken demand for the commodity used in tires and
gloves.  Rubber for delivery in March dropped as much as 1.8 percent
to 268.8 yen a kilogram ($3,443 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, before settling at 269.4 yen, the lowest
finish since Oct. 1.  Soybeans dropped after a government report showed U.S.
farmers completed more than half of their harvesting, easing
concerns of a shortage after a drought damaged crops.  Soybeans for November delivery fell as much as 0.9 percent
to $15.3625 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and were at
$15.44 at 2:12 p.m. Singapore time. Futures have tumbled 14
percent from a record reached on Sept. 4 as the worst U.S.
drought in half a century shriveled crops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
