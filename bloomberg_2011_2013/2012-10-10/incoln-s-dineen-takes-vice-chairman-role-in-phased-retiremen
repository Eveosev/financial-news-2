Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) , the seller
of life insurance and annuities, said Will Fuller, head of the
wholesale distribution unit, will add duties as Robert Dineen
scales back his role as part of a phased retirement.  Fuller, 41, will run a single unit with both wholesale and
retail distribution, the company said today in a statement.
Dineen, 63, who was president of the retail unit, was named a
vice chairman and will continue to report to Chief Executive
Officer Dennis Glass.  Glass is reshaping management at the Radnor, Pennsylvania-
based insurer. Lincoln promoted John Rhodes to chief risk
officer in July and said the same month it hired Ellen Cooper
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as chief investment officer.  Today’s “organizational change reflects our normal
succession process, with no change in our distribution
strategy,” Glass said in the statement.  Fuller had led product distribution for the global wealth
management division at Merrill Lynch & Co. before joining
Lincoln in early 2009, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
