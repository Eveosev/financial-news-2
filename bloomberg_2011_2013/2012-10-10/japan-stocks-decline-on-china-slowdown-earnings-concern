     Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  capping its biggest two-day loss since
July, after carmakers’ sales in China dropped, adding to concern
a territorial dispute between the two nations is weighing on
corporate earnings.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Asia ’s largest carmaker by market
value, fell 1.9 percent after reporting its biggest drop in
China sales since at least 2008.  Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406)  paced losses
among steelmakers after its target price was cut by  Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604)  Toshiba Corp. dropped 4.2 percent on a plan to buy
up a stake in its nuclear-power unit, Westinghouse Electric Co.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 2 percent to 8,596.23
at the close of trading in  Tokyo , capping its biggest two-day
drop since July 23. The broader Topix Index retreated 1.5
percent to 716.84, with about six stocks falling for each that
rose.  “Growth is facing headwinds not only in  China , but also
everywhere, and the territorial dispute is adding another
headache, weighing on the auto sector,” said Kuninobu Takeuchi,
Tokyo-based executive portfolio manager at DIAM Co., which
oversees about 10 trillion yen ($128 billion). “You had
expected a rebound in earnings in the second half of this fiscal
year, but now things seem to be going against that hope.”  The Topix slid 1.6 percent this year as a slowdown in the
global economy boosted demand for the yen as a haven, weighing
on Japanese exporters’ earnings. Policy makers in Asia, the U.S.
and  Europe  have deployed a global wave of stimulus to prop up
growth.  BOJ Easing  The  Bank of Japan  has room to ease policy further,
International Monetary Fund Deputy Managing Director Naoyuki
Shinohara said yesterday in Tokyo, adding to calls from Japanese
politicians for more action by the central bank.  Shares on the Topix trade at about 0.86 times book value,
compared with 2.23 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. A number lower than one
means a company can be bought for less than the value of its
assets.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  were little changed today. The index
fell 1 percent in  New York  yesterday as the IMF cut estimates
for global growth. After close of market, Alcoa Inc., the
largest U.S. aluminum producer, cut its forecast for global
consumption of the material as Chinese economic growth slows.  China Slowdown  “We are clearly seeing the impact of a Chinese slowdown
globally and it’s indicated in Alcoa’s numbers,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of dynamic  asset allocation  at AMP
Capital Investors Ltd., which manages almost $100 billion.
“Equity markets have had a very strong run, so it won’t be
surprising if they go through some correction. In a sense,
actually a correction will be healthy.”  Yesterday marked the five-year anniversary of the  S&P 500 ’s
all-time highest close of 1,565.15. The U.S. equity measure lost
more than half its value from October 2007 through March 2009,
when equity markets bottomed during the global financial crisis.
The gauge recovered to close yesterday 7.9 percent below the
record level.  Japanese carmakers extended yesterday’s losses after
Toyota, Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. reported drops in
China sales after rioters torched dealerships and smashed cars
in protests sparked by a territorial dispute over a group of
islands. Japanese auto brands may lose their market-share lead
in the country for the first time since 2005, according to data
from the China Passenger Car Association.  Honda dropped 1.1 percent to 2,334 yen, while Nissan
rebounded 1.2 percent to 664 yen after sliding as much as 2.6
percent. Toyota retreated 1.9 percent to 2,943 yen, with the
stock also declining after the carmaker recalled 7.4 million
vehicles due to a faulty window switch.  Steelmakers Fall  Kobe Steel dropped 4.8 percent to 60 yen, leading
steelmakers lower, after Nomura cut its target price to 65 yen
from 77 yen. Nisshin Steel Holdings Co. lost 6.6 percent to 596
yen, and Kyoei Steel Ltd. declined 4.9 percent to 1,113 yen.  Toshiba fell 4.2 percent to 252 yen as it plans to pay
about 125 billion yen to acquire Shaw Group Inc.’s 20 percent
stake in Toshiba’s Westinghouse Electric nuclear-power unit.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  added 1.3 percent
to 18.10, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.2 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume on
the Nikkei 225 was about the same as the 30-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
