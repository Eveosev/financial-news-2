Speculation limits for oil, natural
gas and other commodities that were blocked by a federal judge
Sept. 28 reflect wasteful spending by the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, according to four House Republicans.  “The commission’s limited financial resources spent
promulgating and defending the position limits rule demonstrates
a serious mismanagement of the agency’s priorities,”
Representatives Scott Garrett of New Jersey, Spencer Bachus of
 Alabama , and Jeb Hensarling and Randy Neugebauer, both of Texas,
wrote in a letter to CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler today seeking an
accounting of the costs.  The four Republicans asked the CFTC to provide the time
spent on the position limits rule and the total amount it cost
to complete the rule and defend it in court.  U.S. District Judge Robert Wilkins said in his Sept. 28
ruling that the CFTC failed to assess whether the limits imposed
under the Dodd-Frank Act were necessary and appropriate. His
decision blocked a measure scheduled to take effect Oct. 12 that
was challenged by two industry groups that represent  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and other
banks and energy trading firms.  The CFTC is considering a recommendation by the agency’s
general counsel’s office to appeal the judge’s ruling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
