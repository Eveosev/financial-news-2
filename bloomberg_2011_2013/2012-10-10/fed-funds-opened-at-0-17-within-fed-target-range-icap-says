Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.17 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target range of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.28 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.1 percent to 0.28 percent and averaging 0.16 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will sell Treasuries today maturing from
April 2014 to February 2015. The sales are part of the Fed’s
program to replace $267 billion of short-term debt in its
portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an effort to keep
borrowing costs low.  The central bank plans to sell from $7 billion to $8
billion of the securities today, according to the New York Fed’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
