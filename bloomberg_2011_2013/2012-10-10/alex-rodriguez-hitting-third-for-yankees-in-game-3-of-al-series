Alex Rodriguez  will bat third for
the New York Yankees in today’s Major League Baseball playoff
game against the Baltimore Orioles, after producing one hit in
nine at-bats this postseason and striking out five times.  Yankees manager Joe Girardi yesterday didn’t rule out the
possibility of moving Rodriguez down in the lineup. Rodriguez,
however, remains in the No. 3 spot for Game 3 of the American
League Division Series and is the Yankees’ designated hitter
against the Orioles today.  Eric Chavez  will play third base and
bat ninth at Yankee Stadium in New York.  The best-of-five series is tied at one game apiece.  Derek Jeter  will lead off for the Yankees, followed by
Ichiro Suzuki, Rodriguez, Robinson Cano and Nick Swisher.  Mark Teixeira  is hitting sixth, while Curtis Granderson, Russell Martin and Chavez complete the lineup.  Rodriguez, 37, is 3-for-27 with 11 strikeouts over the past
two postseasons. In the Yankees’ 3-2 loss in Game 2 two days
ago, Rodriguez became the first major leaguer in postseason
history with four career game-ending strikeouts.  A three-time AL Most Valuable Player whose 647 home runs
rank fifth on the MLB career list, Rodriguez last hit a homer on
Sept. 14 and has gone 19 games since his last postseason home
run in 2009. He’s now batted third or fourth in the Yankees’
lineup in 121 of 122 starts this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
