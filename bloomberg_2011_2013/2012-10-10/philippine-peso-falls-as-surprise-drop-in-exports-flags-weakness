The Philippine peso fell to a one-
week low after exports unexpectedly contracted in August,
signaling risks to the Southeast Asian economy’s fastest
expansion since 2010.  Government bonds  rose.  Overseas shipments  declined 9 percent from a year earlier
to $3.8 billion, the biggest drop this year, the  National
Statistics Office  said in  Manila  today. That compares with a
median estimate for a 5.5 percent gain in a Bloomberg News
survey. The government may cut local borrowing next quarter
given favorable demand for retail bonds currently on sale,
Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said yesterday.  “We expect exports to remain lackluster as the external
environment remains fairly weak,” said  Prakriti Sofat , a
Singapore-based economist at Barclays Plc. “Economic growth in
the second half will be much softer compared with the first two
quarters.”  The peso slipped 0.2 percent to 41.547 per dollar at the
close of trading in Manila, data from Tullett Prebon Plc showed.
The currency will probably trade at 41.50 at year-end, Sofat
forecast. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at 5.3 percent.  The central bank has cut its overnight borrowing rate three
times this year to a record low 3.75 percent.  “Given that the inflation outlook remains benign for both
this year and next, we have monetary policy space,” central
bank Governor Amando Tetangco said today  The yield on the 8 percent bonds due July 2031 fell 10
basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 5.63 percent, the
lowest level since Sept. 14, according to data from Tradition
Financial Services.  The Bureau of the Treasury sold 63 billion pesos ($1.5
billion) of 6.125 percent retail bonds due 2037 yesterday. Bids
totaled 76.5 billion pesos, allowing the government to sell more
than twice the 30 billion pesos on offer. The sale, which runs
until Oct. 22, may be capped at 100 billion pesos, Treasurer
 Roberto Tan  said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
