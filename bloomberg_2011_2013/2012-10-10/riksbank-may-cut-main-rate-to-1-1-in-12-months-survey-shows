Sweden ’s central bank will cut its
 main lending rate  to 1.1 percent in the next year, according to
a survey of money-market traders and investors.  Consumer prices  will rise 1.2 percent in the next 12
months, the TNS Sifo Prospera survey commissioned by the
Stockholm-based Riksbank showed. Prices will increase 1.7
percent the following year, it showed.  The Riksbank last month cut its benchmark repo rate for a
third time since December, reducing it to 1.25 percent as
 manufacturing  in the export-dependent Nordic economy suffers
from the  European debt crisis . It predicted unchanged rates
until the middle of next year for the biggest Nordic economy,
which sells about half of its output abroad. About 70 percent of
exports go to Europe where countries including the Netherlands
and  France  are cutting spending to reduce debt.  The central bank’s main rate is expected at 1.5 percent in
two years as the Swedish  economy  will grow 1.5 percent in the
next 12 months and 2 percent the following year, according to
the survey published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
