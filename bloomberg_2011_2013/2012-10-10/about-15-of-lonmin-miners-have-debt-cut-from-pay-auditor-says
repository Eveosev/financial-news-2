About 15 percent of  Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s
South African miners have debt repayments deducted directly from
their wages because of court orders won by creditors, according
to an auditor involved in reviewing claims against employees.  “That doesn’t mean that only 15 percent have loans,” Kem
Westdyk, a business manager at Summit Garnishee Solutions, said
in an interview with Moneyweb broadcast on SAFM radio. “I would
say there’s not a miner at Lonmin that doesn’t have a loan.”  Lonmin awarded pay increases of as much as 22 percent after
about 28,000 workers went on strike for six weeks. Under South
African law, creditors can obtain orders from courts demanding
employers deduct money owed to creditors before paying wages.  Lonmin declined to comment on the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
