European Union carbon permits
declined the most in a week after Greek and German auctions and
before a Czech sale for the current trading period tomorrow.  EU carbon allowances for December dropped as much as 3.3
percent to 7.63 euros ($9.84) a metric ton, the biggest intraday
loss since Oct. 3, and closed at 7.72 euros on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in  London .  Germany  sold 850,000 EU carbon permits for this year at
7.67 euros a ton in an auction on the  European Energy Exchange 
AG, according to the Leipzig-based company’s website.  Greece  sold 500,000 allowances for the current trading
period at 7.64 euros a ton, according to the Athens Exchange,
which hosted the  auction .  The  Czech Republic  will offer 1 million spot permits on the
European Energy Exchange tomorrow from the reserve for new
entrants in the 2008-2012 period of the EU emissions program.  Prices recovered from their lowest of the day after EEX
announced it was delaying its first auction of EU permits for
the next phase of the bloc’s carbon market by two weeks. The
first sale of so-called Phase 3 allowances will take place on
Oct. 26, the exchange said in an e-mailed statement.  United Nations carbon offsets for December fell as much as
9.5 percent to 1.71 euros before closing at 1.74 euros on ICE
Futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
