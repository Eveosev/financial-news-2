Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
 Brazil ’s second-biggest airline by market share, fell to a four-
week low as the country’s antitrust regulator approved its
acquisition of Webjet Linhas Aereas SA.  Shares sank 2.8 percent to 10.93 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the lowest since Sept. 12. The benchmark
 Bovespa index  slid 0.8 percent. Before the decision was
announced, the stock lost as much as 4.4 percent.  Officials at the regulator, known as Cade, authorized the
acquisition with one restriction: Gol will have to achieve an
efficiency rate of at least 85 percent at its slots in  Rio de
Janeiro ’s Santos Dumont airport. The 96 million reais ($47
million) merger was agreed to in July 2011.  “The big question now is how the air carrier will conduct
the merger in a very challenging scenario of rising fuel prices
and demand that’s not rising,” Leonardo Nitta, an analyst at
 Banco do Brasil , said by phone from  Sao Paulo .  Gol’s shares have lost 12 percent  this year . Webjet isn’t
publicly traded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
