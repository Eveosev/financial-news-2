Poland is seeking to raise as much
as 858 million zloty ($271 million) from the sale of its 50
percent stake in ZE PAK SA utility in what is set to be the
country’s largest initial public offering in more than a year.  The government, which offers 26 million shares, set the
maximum price for individual investors at 33 zloty a share,
according to an IPO prospectus published on PAK’s website today.
The price range for institutional investors, who can place bids
until Oct. 22, was set at 26 zloty to 33 zloty, according to the
terms obtained by Bloomberg News today.  “The price looks attractive near the lower end of the
range,” Adam Drozdowski, who helps manage the equivalent of
$275 million at Axa TFI SA in Warsaw, said by phone. “This is a
restructuring story and there’s lots of risk after the company
bought coal mining assets this year.”  The IPO is set to be the biggest in Warsaw since the 5.37
billion-zloty sale of state-owned coal mine  Jastrzebska Spolka
Weglowa SA (JSW)  in June 2011. The government has raised 8.12 billion
zloty from asset sales this year to help finance the budget
deficit, compared with its full-year goal of 10 billion zloty.
In July Poland sold PAK two coal mines for 175.5 million zloty.  Billionaire Owner  Billionaire Zygmunt Solorz-Zak owns 49 percent of PAK and
plans to raise his stake to 51.7 percent in the IPO, according
to the company’s presentation in Warsaw today. Solorz-Zak
pledged not to sell his holding for 180 days after the IPO.  The  Konin , Poland-based company will start trading on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange on Oct. 30, becoming the fourth-largest
Polish power producer on the bourse after  PGE SA (PGE) ,  Tauron Polska
Energia SA (TPE)  and  Enea SA. (ENA)  The final price that investors will pay
for PAK will be set on Oct. 22, according to the prospectus.  PGE shares sank 2.5 percent to 17.56 zloty at 2:30 p.m. in
Warsaw, heading for the lowest close since May 25, while Tauron
lost 2.7 percent to a two-month low of 4.71 zloty as PAK’s sale
was priced below the industry’s valuation.  Based on the IPO price range, PAK is valued at 1.35 billion
zloty to 1.71 billion zloty, or 4.3 times to 5.4 times earnings
seen this year. PGE currently trades 8 times profit, while
Tauron is valued 6.8 times earnings, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  PAK, which has 2,462 megawatts of installed generation
capacity, posted net income of 214.4 million zloty on sales of
1.28 billion zloty in the first half of the year. The company
expects its net income in 2012 to be “close to” last year’s
317 million zloty, Chief Executive Officer Katarzyna Muszkat
said at a news conference today.  The company plans to spend 1.6 billion zloty by 2015 to
upgrade its Patnow plant and a further 2.8 billion zloty to
build two gas-fired units, it said in the prospectus.  Credit Suisse Group AG, ING Groep NV, JPMorgan & Chase Co.
and UniCredit SpA are global coordinators for the sale, while
Espirito Santo Investment Bank, Ipopema Securities SA, Trigon
Dom Maklerski SA and PKO Bank Polski SA are joint book runners.  To contact the reporters on this story:
