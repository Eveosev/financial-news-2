Raw sugar from  Brazil , the world’s
largest producer, is trading at a bigger discount as offers to
sell the sweetener increase, according to SA Commodities.  Raw sugar for loading in October traded yesterday at a
discount of 0.77 cent a pound to the price of the March futures
contract on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange, the Santos, Brazil-
based brokerage and consultancy said in a report e-mailed
yesterday. That is 0.07 cent a pound lower than the previous
cargo traded on Oct. 5, according to the report.  “It seems that we do have a lot of sellers in the market,
which is not the case for buyers,” said Luiz Carlos dos Santos
Jr., head of sugar brokerage and operations at the company.  Sellers for October loading were yesterday offering the
sweetener at a discount of 0.65 cent a pound to the exchange
price, while buyers wanted to receive a discount of 0.8 cents a
pound, SA Commodities data showed.  Raw sugar for March delivery fell 0.6 percent to 21.35
cents a pound 5:43 a.m. in  New York  trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
