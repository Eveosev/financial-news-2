Novelis Inc., the largest supplier
of flat-rolled aluminum products to the global  auto industry ,
plans to more than triple recycling capacity by 2020 to meet
increased demand.  The capacity may grow to 2.1 million metric tons by 2015
and to 4 million tons by 2020 from 1.2 million tons now, Derek Prichett, vice president for global recycling, said in an
interview. Novelis, the U.S. unit of India’s  Hindalco Industries
Ltd. (HNDL) , plans to make 50 percent of its products from recycled
metal by 2015 and as much as 80 percent by 2020, from about 39
percent at present, Prichett said in Seoul on Oct. 9.  To meet the expanded recycling target, Novelis is building
plants in Germany and South Korea and doubling capacity in
 Brazil , Prichett said. Aluminum demand for auto applications may
grow at an average annual rate of 25 percent globally over the
next five years, the fastest pace among major markets, he said.  “It’s a huge growth,” Prichett said, referring to the
projected increase in auto-parts demand. “There’s been a very
fast increase in that market in Europe and North America, but
also it is growing very fast in  Asia  and in  China .”  Aluminum futures fell as much as 0.8 percent to $1,993 a
ton on the London Metal Exchange today, dropping below $2,000
for the first time since Sept. 7, and traded at $1,998 at 2:47
p.m. in Singapore.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. producer, on Oct.
9 cut its global demand forecast for this year to 6 percent
growth from 7 percent, citing slowing Chinese demand.  ‘Very Attractive’  While there are concerns about the economic slowdown in
China, the world’s biggest user of aluminum, the Asian country
is still “very attractive” in the long term, Prichett said.
The country accounts for about 40 percent of global production
and demand, according to an estimate from researcher Brook Hunt.  “When we say slowdown in growth, we are talking about
slowdown to maybe only 6 to 8 percent growth instead of 8 to 10
percent growth,” he said. “If you compare to say  North America 
at less than 2 percent growth, the Chinese market is still
growing very fast even at the reduced expectations.”  The  Asian Development Bank  cut its forecast for China’s
economic growth this year to 7.7 percent from 8.2 percent.
Manufacturing in China contracted a second month for the first
time since 2009, a report showed last week.  The beverage-can market may grow at an average of 4 percent
to 6 percent a year over the next five years, led by Asia and
Brazil, Prichett said. Demand in Asia for each of the auto and
can markets may grow faster than global averages, Prichett said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
