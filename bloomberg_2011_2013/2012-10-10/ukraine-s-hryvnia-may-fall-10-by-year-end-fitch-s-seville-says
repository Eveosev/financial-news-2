Ukraine’s hryvnia may depreciate 10
percent by year-end because of “fairly weak” confidence in the
currency, according to Charles Seville, director of Fitch
Ratings’s sovereign group.  While officials including Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  say
the hryvnia will remain stable, moving to a more flexible
exchange-rate regime would benefit the former Soviet republic in
the medium term, Seville said today.  “There is pressure on the currency,” he told a conference
in  London . While derivatives investors are predicting a
devaluation, “it’s not going to be on the scale of 2008.”  The hryvnia, which has declined 1.2 percent against the
dollar this year, plunged almost 35 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2008 after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed.
Ukraine’s gold and foreign-currency reserves fell 2.5 percent
last month as the  Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy  sold $1.8 billion to
support the hryvnia.  Fitch is “watching how Ukraine will meet financing needs
in 2013” and sees the government refinancing its loans to the
 International Monetary Fund , Seville said.  The Washington-based lender granted Ukraine a bailout in
July 2010 before freezing it the following March after the
government rejected demands to raise household heating tariffs.
Ukraine spends as much as 2 percent of gross domestic product on
natural-gas subsidies for state-run energy company NAK Naftogaz
Ukrainy, according to Seville.  To contact the reporters on this story:
