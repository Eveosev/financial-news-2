The premium for United Nations
emission credits for December 2013 over those for this year
widened to the most for three weeks as futures declined a second
day.  The spread widened as much as 13 percent to 26 euro cents
($0.33) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London  and was at 25 cents at 11:54 a.m. UN Certified Emission
Reduction credits for this year dropped 6.4 percent to 1.77
euros a ton, extending yesterdayâ€™s 3.1 percent loss.  European Union carbon permits declined as supplies sold at
auctions will jump to 4.25 million tons from today through Oct.
12.  Germany  and the  Czech Republic  will sell allowances on the
 European Energy Exchange AG  in Leipzig, Germany on those days.
There are another 6.05 million tons for sale next week, further
adding to supply.  European Union carbon permits for December, the industry
benchmark, fell 1.7 percent to 7.76 euros a ton, taking the loss
in the past year to 31 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
