MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI) , a
provider of cash transfers worldwide, won a judge’s permission
to pay $10 million to settle a 2011 shareholder lawsuit over a
company recapitalization plan.  MoneyGram designed the plan to let controlling investors
convert about 29 percent of their $760 million investment in
preferred stock, diluting common stockholders’ value and voting
power, investors contended.  The settlement was fair and reasonable given the
“uncertainty” of the outcome of a trial, said Delaware
Chancery Court Judge J. Travis Laster in approving the agreement
today at a hearing in Wilmington.  Laster withheld a decision on a request by plaintiffs’
lawyers for $3.65 million in fees and expenses from the
settlement fund, pending receipt of further information.  “We were beating the tar out of each other right to the
end” of settlement talks, John C., Wander, a lawyer for Dallas-
based MoneyGram, told Laster. The company didn’t oppose the
initial fee request.  MoneyGram fell 29 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $16.59 at
11:55 a.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The
settlement, minus legal fees, is to be distributed to
shareholders, according to court papers.  The recapitalization agreement, approved last year by
shareholders, involved investment affiliates of  Thomas H. Lee
Partners LP  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)   The case is Pittman v. Clark, CA6387, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
