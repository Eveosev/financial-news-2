Option NV (OPTI) , the Belgian maker of
wireless broadband-access devices, fell the most in more than
seven months after saying it was seeking a  cash injection  of at
least 5 million euros ($6.4 million) by year end.  Option declined as much as 18 percent and traded 6 cents
lower at 34 cents a share at 10:50 a.m. in Brussels. That’s the
sharpest drop since Feb. 23.  The company’s board is investigating “ different options  to
strengthen its working capital” in an effort “to secure the
prospect of regaining profitability and sustainable growth,”
Option said today in an e-mailed statement. On June 30, the
company had 13 million euros of cash on hand, down from 25.2
million euros at the beginning of the year, Option said on Aug.
31.  Since the end of the first half, the cash position “has
been further impacted by the build-up of inventory and the
longer sales cycles for the new products,” Option said.  The 5 million-euro amount is “only a  first step ,” KBC
analysts said in a note today. “More drastic” measures are
needed, said the analysts, who have a sell recommendation on the
shares.
“So far, Option has been unable to prove that its strategy --
focusing on value-added products, away from commoditised
hardware -- is successful,” they said.  Option said it is continuing its efforts to reduce costs
while at the same time seeking to develop its brand name and
adding sales channels in  North America ,  China  and  Europe .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
