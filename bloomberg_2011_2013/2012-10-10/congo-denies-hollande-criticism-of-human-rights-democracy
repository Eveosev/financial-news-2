Democratic Republic  of Congo’s
government denied criticism of its  human rights  record by French
President Francois Hollande three days before his arrival in the
country for a meeting of French-speaking nations.  Hollande told reporters in Paris yesterday that the
situation in Congo regarding human rights, democracy, and
recognition of opposition was “totally unacceptable.” The
French president plans to spend Oct. 13 in Congo’s capital,
Kinshasa, for the biannual meeting of the Francophonie.  “The DR Congo of today is one of the rare countries in
sub-Saharan Africa in which the rights of the opposition are
recognized,” Congo’s Minister of Communication Lambert Mende
said today in an e-mailed statement. Reforms of its electoral
and judicial institutions are under way, “and will not be the
result of outside pressure,” he said.  Congo’s President  Joseph Kabila  was re-elected to a second
term last November in a vote marred by violence and ballot-
stuffing, according to monitors from the country’s Catholic
Church and the European Union. It was the Central African
nation’s second democratic election after more than 30 years of
dictatorship and a series of wars that ended officially in 2003.  Hollande plans to meet with opposition and human rights
leaders during his trip.  To contact the reporter on this story:
