Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  raised
$2.5 billion in its third dollar-denominated bond sale this year
of benchmark size, or bigger than $500 million.  The lender’s Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. unit sold $1.5
billion of 1.55 percent, five-year securities that yield 90
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and $1
billion of 2.95 percent debt due in 2022 at a relative yield of
130 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Mizuho said last week it would book 173.7 billion yen ($2.2
billion) in losses related to domestic stock holdings.  Japan ’s third-biggest bank by market value last sold more
than $500 million of dollar obligations in July, issuing $1.5
billion of 4.2 percent, 10-year subordinated debt that traded at
103.4 cents on the dollar to yield 3.78 percent yesterday,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Tokyo-based lender
also issued $1.5 billion of 2.55 percent, five year securities
in March.  The new bonds may be rated A1 by Moody’s Investors Service,
according to a person familiar with the offering who asked not
to be identified, citing lack of authorization to speak
publicly. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes,
the person said.  The banking group expects to recognize the valuation losses
in the three months ended Sept. 30, Mizuho said in a statement
to the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Oct. 5. The lender owns stakes of
more than 1,200 companies including electronics maker Sharp
Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
