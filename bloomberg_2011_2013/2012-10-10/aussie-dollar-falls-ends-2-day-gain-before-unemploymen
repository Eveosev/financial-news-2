Australia ’s dollar advanced for a
third day after the nation sold its longest-dated debt in three
decades, boosting demand for the country’s assets.  The so-called Aussie gained versus all but one of its 16
major counterparts after prices for iron ore, Australia’s
biggest export, surged to a two-month high. Demand for the
currency was tempered before a report tomorrow that may show
unemployment climbed to the highest in three months. New
Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, dropped as Asian stocks
followed a slide in global equities.  “Demand for Australian bonds is supporting the currency,”
said Lee Wai Tuck, currency strategist at Forecast Pte in
Singapore. “But I think interest is still to sell the Aussie on
rallies.”  The Australian dollar rose 0.2 percent to $1.0226 at 4:21
p.m. in Sydney. It added 0.2 percent to 79.99 yen. New Zealand’s
currency dropped 0.1 percent to 81.72 U.S. cents. It bought
63.92 yen, 0.1 percent lower than the close in New York.  Australia’s  10-year note yield  rose two basis points to
3.09 percent. New Zealand’s swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates, was unchanged at 2.625 percent.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares declined 0.7 percent.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1 percent yesterday.  Australia today sold A$3.25 billion ($3.3 billion) of 3.25
percent notes due in April 2029, according to an e-mailed
statement from the Australian Office of Financial Management.
The security has the longest maturity on record in AOFM data
going back to 1982. Today’s sale matches the government’s
largest ever offering.  Ore Prices  Physical iron ore  with 62 percent content at the Chinese
port of Tianjin jumped 6.2 percent yesterday to $117.20 a ton,
the highest close since Aug. 1, according to The Steel Index
Ltd.  China  is Australia’s biggest trading partner and New
Zealand’s second-biggest export destination.  The  jobless rate  in Australia probably rose to 5.3 percent
in September from 5.1 percent in the previous month, according
to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
before the statistics bureau releases the report tomorrow. If
confirmed, that would be the highest since June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
