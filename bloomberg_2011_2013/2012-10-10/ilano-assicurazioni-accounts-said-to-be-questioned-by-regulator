Italian market regulator Consob has
challenged the 2011 results of  Milano Assicurazioni SpA (MI) , the
insurer controlled by  Fondiaria-SAI SpA (FSA) , according to two people
with knowledge of the matter.  Consob sent a letter to Milano questioning the insurer’s
accounting of 249 million euros ($321 million) of reserves and
requesting more documents, one of the people said, asking not to
be identified because the letter isn’t public.  The probe raises more questions about the insurer’s ability
to reach its targets, Fidentiis Equities said in a note to
clients today. Milano Assicurazioni is merging with Fondiaria,
 Premafin Finanziaria SpA (PF)  and Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA as
part of a plan to rescue Fondiaria. Consob’s probe follows a
similar review of Fondiaria’s accounts in June.  Milano Assicurazioni  shares fell  4.7 percent to 32.4 cents
in Milan trading, giving the company a market value of 633
million euros. The stock has gained 44 percent this year.  Milano Assicurazioni and Consob officials declined to
comment on the probe, which was reported earlier today by  Il
Messaggero .  To contact the reporter on this story:
