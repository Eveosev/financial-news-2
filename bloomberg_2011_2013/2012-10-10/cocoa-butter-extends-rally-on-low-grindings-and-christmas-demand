Cocoa butter, used to make
chocolate, extended a five-month rally in  Europe  with bean
processors keeping grindings curbed just as demand increases
before Christmas, said three traders involved in the sales.  The cost of cocoa butter relative to the price of beans on
the NYSE Liffe exchange rose to a ratio of 1.85 to 1.9, said the
traders, who declined to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak to the media. The butter, which accounts for
as much as 20 percent of the weight of a chocolate bar, was at
1.66 to 1.75 times the bean futures price on Sept. 14.  Cocoa butter ratios have been rising since May, according
to data from KnowledgeCharts, a unit of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania-
based researcher  Commodities Risk Analysis LC . The last time the
ratio in Europe was above 1.9 was in November 2009, the data
showed. Demand for the by-product of bean grinding rises before
Christmas as chocolate sales gain.  Cocoa processors slowed their factories because of
declining prices of cocoa powder, another by-product of bean
grinding. Lower powder prices reduced their profitability, which
is determined by the prices of powder and butter divided by that
of beans. Cocoa powder in Europe was at 3,002 euros ($3,871) a
metric ton on Oct. 5, down 14 percent this year, KnowledgeCharts
data showed.  European cocoa grinding may fall 15 percent in the three
months ended Sept. 30 compared with a year earlier, according to
a Bloomberg survey of 10 traders published Aug. 24. The European
Cocoa Association will release the grind data on Oct. 16 after
some participants delayed reporting, the Brussels-based group
said on Oct. 5. Processing fell 18 percent in Europe in the
second quarter.  When  cocoa beans  are ground, about 80 percent is turned
into cocoa liquor, which is then processed into powder and
butter, according to  Barry Callebaut AG (BARN) , the world’s largest
bulk chocolate maker.  Cocoa for March delivery was down 1.6 percent to 1,543
pounds ($2,470) a ton by 5:09 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
