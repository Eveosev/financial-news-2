Angel Pagan , Gregor Blanco and Pablo
Sandoval hit home runs to lead the San Francisco Giants to an
8-3 win against the Cincinnati Reds, forcing a decisive fifth
game tomorrow in their National League Division Series.  The Giants, who lost the first two games of the best-of-
five Major League Baseball series at home, now have won two
straight in Cincinnati -- the site of Game 5.  The winner of the series will play either the St. Louis
Cardinals or the Washington Nationals for a spot in the  World
Series . The defending champion Cardinals defeated the Nationals
8-0 earlier today to take a 2-1 lead in that series.  In the American League, the  New York  Yankees host the
Baltimore Orioles tonight with their series tied 1-1. The
visiting Detroit Tigers lead the Oakland Athletics 2-1 and will
try for the second straight night to finish off their series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
