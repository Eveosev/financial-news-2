Bulgaria ’s Cabinet approved next
year’s draft budget and imposed a 10 percent tax on interest
from deposits to boost revenue and spending before elections.  The draft budget, which has yet to be debated and approved
by Parliament, assumes economic growth of 1.2 percent under a
pessimistic scenario and 1.9 percent under an optimistic one,
Finance Minister  Simeon Djankov  told reporters in the capital
Sofia today.  “The budget sets a sustainable macro-economic environment
and encourages quicker economic recovery,” Djankov said. “It
will provide the funds needed to deal with challenges in
education, culture, infrastructure projects, environment
protection and welfare.”  Bulgaria, the European Union’s poorest country in terms of
economic output per capita, weathered the global crisis without
borrowing from lenders abroad. Growth slowed to 0.5 percent from
a year earlier in the second quarter, the same as in the first
three months. The government works to cut the budget gap to help
contain the fallout from the euro debt crisis.  Next year’s budget-deficit assumption is 1.3 percent of
gross domestic product, unchanged from this year, he said. Next
year’s revenue is estimated at 30.55 billion lev ($20.13
billion) or 37.5 percent of GDP, a 1.84 billion-lev increase
from this year. Spending is projected at 31.65 billion lev or
38.8 percent of GDP, a 1.85 billion-lev increase from 2012.  Interest Tax  The government forecasts average EU-harmonized inflation at
3.4 percent next year, after 2.6 percent this year. The
government set a public debt limit of 14.6 billion lev, or 17.8
percent of GDP, in 2013.  The Balkan country will impose in 2013 a 10 percent tax on
interest from deposits for households, which will provide 120
million lev in revenue, Djankov said. The government plans to
keep personal and corporate income taxes unchanged from a flat
10 percent next year, in an effort to attract more investment
and boost growth, he said.  The interest tax “will not affect Bulgarian banks’
indicators and their stability,” the central bank in Sofia said
in an e-mailed statement today. “Bank deposits have no
alternative as the best form of savings” in Bulgaria, the bank
said.  Bulgaria will raise pensions by 9.3 percent, minimal wages
by about 7 percent and army salaries by 9 percent next year,
Djankov said.  The  International Monetary Fund  raised this year’s economic
growth forecast for Bulgaria on Oct. 2 to 1 percent from a 0.8
percent estimate on April 17, and to 1.5 percent for 2013 citing
recovering exports.  The economy grew 1.7 percent last year, after a revised 0.4
percent in 2010. The European Commission forecasts the economy
to expand 0.5 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
