New Zealand  manufacturing contracted
for a third month in September amid weak domestic orders and a
rising currency, a private survey showed.  The performance of manufacturing  index  rose to 48.2 from a
revised 47.4 in August,  Bank of New Zealand  Ltd. and Business
New Zealand said in an e-mailed report today. An index less than
50 shows that the industry is contracting.  The New Zealand dollar’s 5 percent gain this year makes it
the best-performing Group of 10 currency and has curbed returns
from exports and prompted manufacturers such as Norske Skog to
reduce production and fire workers. Prime Minister John Key has
dismissed calls from his political opponents to weaken the
currency to help struggling businesses.  “Talk that the industry is in crisis is overblown,”  Craig Ebert , senior economist at Bank of New Zealand in Wellington,
said in the report. “While the data are worryingly weak, they
are about current conditions rather than the way ahead.
Expectations for output over the next three months remain
positive.”  Four of the five sub-indexes were in contraction, with the
new orders gauge falling to the lowest since May 2009, today’s
report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
