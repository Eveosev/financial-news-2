Canadian  stocks  fell to the lowest
level in almost five weeks after Alcoa Inc. cut its aluminum
outlook on weakening demand in China, the world’s biggest
commodities consumer.  Niko Resources Ltd., an oil and gas explorer, slumped 8.5
percent.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  retreated 1 percent.  AuRico Gold Inc. (AUQ) 
surged 21 percent after selling mining properties in Mexico to
billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s Minera Frisco SAB.  Centerra Gold Inc. (CG) 
jumped 5.1 percent after analysts at Canaccord Genuity raised
the stock’s rating.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  retreated 61.15
points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,212.42 in Toronto, its lowest
level since Sept. 6. The benchmark equity gauge is up 2.2
percent this year. Energy and bank shares  contributed  the most
to losses in the S&P/TSX as seven of 10 industries retreated.  “Alcoa is rephrasing what we’ve been seeing all along,”
Pat McHugh, senior managing director and Canadian equity
strategist with Manulife Asset Management Ltd., said from
Toronto. The firm manages about $218 billion. “China is slowing
down and Europe is in recession and getting worse.”  Alcoa (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum producer, cut its forecast
for global consumption of the metal by 1 percentage point on
slowing Chinese demand, the company said yesterday. The
International Monetary Fund said today European banks may need
to sell as much as $4.5 trillion in assets through 2013 if
policy makers fall short of pledges to stem the fiscal crisis,
up 18 percent from its April estimate.  Energy Shares  Niko Resources, the worst-performing stock in the S&P/TSX
this year, fell 8.5 percent to C$14.93. Enbridge retreated 1
percent to C$39.46.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  declined 1.2 percent to
C$32.29 and  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE)  lost 1.5 percent to C$33.68.  Crude for November delivery slipped 1.2 percent to settle
at $91.25 a barrel in  New York .  AuRico Gold jumped 21 percent to C$7.60, its biggest gain
since November 2008. The company agreed to sell its Ocampo mine
and several other projects under development in the Chihuahua
and Nayarit states to Slim’s Minera Frisco for $750 million.
Slim is the world’s richest person, according to the Bloomberg
Billionaires Index.  Centerra advanced 5.1 percent to C$12.38 after Steven Butler, analyst with Canaccord Genuity,  raised  the stock to a
buy from a hold and increased his price target to C$16.50 from
C$8.70 on reduced risk of government intervention at its Kumtor
mine in Kyrgyzstan.  “The shares offer good risk-reward at current prices,” he
said in a research note today.  Metal Producers  Kinross Gold Corp. (K) , Canada’s third-largest gold producer by
sales, gained 0.7 percent to C$10.25 after saying Chief
Financial Officer Paul Barry will leave the company to pursue
other interests. Kinross fired its chief executive officer, Tye
Burt, two months ago, replacing him with J. Paul Rollinson.  Keegan Resrouces Inc. (KGN) , a metals exploration company, rose
18 percent to C$3.58, the most since February 2009 after
increasing its estimate for the amount of gold at the Esaase
project in Ghana. The company said the site has a measured and
indicated gold resource of 3.83 million ounces, compared with a
September 2011 estimate of 3.64 million ounces.  Gold futures for December delivery rose 10 cents to settle
at $1,765.10 in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
