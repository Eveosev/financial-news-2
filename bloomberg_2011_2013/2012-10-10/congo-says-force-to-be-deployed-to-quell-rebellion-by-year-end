A neutral force of 4,000 troops will
deploy in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s eastern border with
 Rwanda  and Uganda by the end of the year to combat rebel forces,
Congolese Minister of Communication Lambert Mende said.  The decision to deploy the force under the auspices of the
United Nations and African Union came after heads of state from
the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region met in
Kampala, Uganda, on Oct. 8, Mende said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Congo accuses Rwanda of supporting a rebellion in its east
that has led to the displacement of nearly half a million
people. Rwanda denies the allegations.  The ICGLR will submit a proposal for the force to the UN
Security Council for approval, Mende said. “For the large
majority of the 11 countries of the ICGLR, the neutral force
constitutes the ideal solution to resolve the conflict between
Rwanda and DR Congo,” he said.  The UN already has about 19,000 personnel in its
peacekeeping mission in Congo, almost all of whom are stationed
in the east. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said Sept. 27 that
the idea of an additional force needed to be further refined
before the Security Council could consider it.  Tanzania has offered a battalion for the force, according
to the ICGLR.  To contact the reporter on this story:
