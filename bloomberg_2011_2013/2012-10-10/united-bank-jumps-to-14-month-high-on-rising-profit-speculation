United Bank for Africa Plc  surged to
the highest level in 14 months on speculation the Nigerian
lender will post an increase in third-quarter profit in results
expected within a week.  The stock gained 4.9 percent to 5.17 naira today in Lagos,
 Nigeria ’s commercial capital, its highest closing price since
Aug. 2, 2011.  “The first two quarters have been very good and the
expectation of investors is that this trend will continue in the
third quarter,” Abiola Rasaq, a Lagos-based analyst with Vetiva
Capital Management Ltd. who  rates  the stock the equivalent of
hold, said by phone today. UBA’s results may be released as
early as Oct. 12, “or early next week,” he said.  Calls and a text message to Nasir Ramon Olarenwaju, a
spokesman for the Lagos-based bank, requesting details of the
earnings release date weren’t immediately returned.  UBA’s net income in the second quarter more than doubled to
27.1 billion naira ($172 million) from 10.3 billion naira a year
earlier, the bank said on July 10. Revenue rose to 111 billion
naira from 91.27 billion naira.  Shares of the lender have more than  doubled  this year,
compared with a 30 percent advance in the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   Diamond Bank Plc (DIAMONDB) , a Lagos-based
lender, released its third-quarter results yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
