AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) , the airline owner
restructuring in bankruptcy, is seeking court approval to obtain
as much as $1.5 billion in financing backed by aircraft that it
said will reduce interest expenses.  AMR has negotiated terms of the financing and will repay
$1.3 billion in outstanding notes, the parent company of
American Airlines said yesterday in a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in  Manhattan .  “Time is of the essence because there can be no assurance
that market conditions will continue,” the company said.  AMR’s $174.2 million of 13 percent secured notes due in
August 2016 dropped 3 cents to 103.5 cents on the dollar at
8:31 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
Its $703.6 million of 8.625 pass-through certificates plunged
4 cents to 103.5.  The airline wants to redeem the 13 percent notes, the
8.625 certificates and $445.6 million of 10.375 percent pass-
through debt, “without the payment of any make-whole amount”
or “any other premium or prepayment penalty,” AMR said in the
court filing.  AMR, based in Fort Worth,  Texas , said interest-expense
savings under the financing may be more than $200 million. The
request requires approval from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane.  The bankruptcy case is In re AMR Corp., 11-15463, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
