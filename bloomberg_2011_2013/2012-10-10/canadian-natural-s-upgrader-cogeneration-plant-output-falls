Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) ’s
cogeneration  plant  that helps supply the Horizon  upgrader  with
electricity has slowed production, according to data from the
Alberta Electric System operator’s website compiled by
Bloomberg.  The cogeneration plant, which processes natural gas to help
supply the 110,000-barrel-a-day upgrader, reduced its “net to
grid power” to zero on Oct. 7, the data showed. The plant’s
average net output was 105 megawatts from Sept. 18 to Oct. 6.  The Calgary-based company didn’t immediately respond to an
e-mail sent to the investor relations department asking the
status of the upgrader and if production was affected.  The cogeneration plant has total generating capacity of 187
megawatts, according to a 2005  permit  on file with the Alberta
Energy and Utilities Board.  Canadian Natural said Oct. 3 that maintenance previously
planned for the third quarter has been delayed and is scheduled
to begin at the upgrader tomorrow. President  Steve Laut  said
during an Aug. 9 conference call that repairs to heat exchangers
and mechanical seals were scheduled for the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
