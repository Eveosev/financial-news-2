Grupo Interbolsa (INTBOL) , owner of
 Colombia ’s biggest brokerage, plans to expand into Chile and
Peru to capitalize on growth in Andean stock markets, Chief
Executive Officer Rodrigo Jaramillo said.  “We are looking to strengthen the company with a strategic
partner that can contribute to its development and expansion in
the region,” Jaramillo said in a phone interview today from New
York, where he said he is in discussions with potential
partners. He declined to give further details on the talks,
citing a confidentiality agreement.  Grupo Interbolsa also is looking to boost its presence in
Colombia amid increased competition as the country’s market
expands, Jaramillo said.  Brazil ’s BTG Pactual SA in June bought
Bogota-based brokerage Bolsa y Renta SA. In late December, Banco
de Credito del  Peru  purchased a 51 percent stake in Correval SA.  Jaramillo denied speculation that Interbolsa is closing its
brokerage in Brazil.  “That is completely false,” he said. “Our presence in
Brazil is fundamental and those unfounded rumors are damaging to
the company.”  Interbolsa has dropped 24 percent this year, compared with
the benchmark IGBC index’s 12 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
