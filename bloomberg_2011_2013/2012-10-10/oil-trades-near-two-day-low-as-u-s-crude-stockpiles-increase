Oil advanced in  New York  amid
concern that escalating tensions between Syria and Turkey may
disrupt supplies from the Middle East. Brent’s premium to West
Texas Intermediate crude widened to the most in almost a year.  Futures rose as much as 1.2 percent after Turkey seized
cargo on a Syrian passenger plane and on unconfirmed reports of
the discovery of weapons parts and military communications gear.
The Middle East accounts for about 33 percent of world oil
supplies, according to BP Plc. The  American Petroleum Institute 
said yesterday that U.S. crude inventories rose 1.6 million
barrels last week, and the Energy Department is forecast to
report a 1.5 million barrel gain for the period today.  “The unrest between Syria and Turkey is a lit powder
keg,” said Michael Poulsen, an analyst at Global Risk
Management in Middelfart, Denmark, who predicts  Brent crude  may
advance to $120 a barrel this month. “The general supply-demand
situation is balanced, walking a tightrope between weaker growth
projections and the risk of supply disruptions.”  WTI for November delivery increased as much as $1.06 to
$92.31 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was up 86 cents at $92.11 as of 1:06 p.m. London
time. The contract fell 1.2 percent yesterday to $91.25, the
lowest close since Oct. 8. Prices are down 7 percent this year.  Brent for November settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange advanced 78 cents to $115.11 a barrel.
The European benchmark crude was at a $22.95 premium to WTI. The
spread was $23.08 yesterday, the widest closing level since Oct.
21, 2011.  Gasoil Contract  The October gasoil contract on the ICE exchange expires
today. It traded at $1,027 a metric ton at 11:38 a.m. in London.  About 1.2 million barrels of crude a day is shipped from
the Turkish port of Ceyhan, according to consultants Petromatrix
GmbH in Zug, Switzerland. Ceyhan is the export location for most
of the oil pumped in northern Iraq, the second-largest producer
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and for
supplies from  Azerbaijan .  Crude inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point
for the WTI futures, increased 297,000 barrels last week to 44.1
million, the API data showed.  “The market is factoring in an inventory build and a
little bit more demand destruction,” said  Jonathan Barratt ,
chief executive officer of Barratt’s Bulletin, a commodity
newsletter in Sydney.  U.S. Gasoline  U.S. gasoline  consumption  will average 8.72 million barrels
a day this year, down from 8.75 million in 2011 and a projection
last month of 8.73 million, the DOE’s Energy Information
Administration said yesterday in its monthly Short-Term Energy
Outlook. WTI will average $95.55 a barrel this year, down from
its September forecast of $95.66, the report showed.  Gasoline for November delivery in New York was little
changed after closing at $2.9593 yesterday, the highest this
month.  Stockpiles of the motor fuel increased 2.5 million barrels
last week, the API said. The DOE report today will show a gain
of  250,000 barrels , according to the median estimate of 11
analysts surveyed. Distillate supplies, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, decreased 6.2 million barrels, the API
report showed. A 1 million-barrel drop is projected in the
government data.  California Blend  Gasoline at the pump in  California  declined from a record
as refiners began making a different blend of fuel after
receiving permission from the state. The average price slid to
$4.666 a gallon yesterday from an all-time high of $4.671 on
Oct. 9, according to AAA, the nation’s largest motoring
organization. Wholesale California-blend in  Los Angeles  slid
22.5 cents to 34 cents a gallon above New York futures after the
 California Energy Commission  said inventories in the state
climbed 4.9 percent last week.  Prices had surged after a  power failure  at Exxon Mobil
Corp.’s 150,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Torrance near Los
Angeles, a fire at  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s plant in Richmond close to
 San Francisco , and the closing of a Chevron pipeline that
delivers crude to northern California. The  California Air
Resources Board  granted refineries permission on Oct. 7 to make
gasoline with a higher vapor pressure, allowing them to produce
more of the fuel by adding butane to the mix.  To contact the reporters on this story:
