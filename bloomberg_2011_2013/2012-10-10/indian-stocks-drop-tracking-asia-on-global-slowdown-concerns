Indian stocks dropped, mirroring
losses in Asia, on concerns a slowdown in China and the debt
crisis in  Europe  will curb growth and hurt overseas investor
demand for the nation’s equities.  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the nation’s largest lender, slumped
2.7 percent. The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  fell for a third day
and headed for a one-month low. China car sales unexpectedly
shrank for the first time in eight months while Alcoa Inc. said
the nation’s slowing growth will cut global demand for aluminum.

2.1 percent.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, slid 0.9 percent
to 18,620.54, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai, its lowest close since Sept. 27. Spain’s Prime
Minister Mariano Rajoy is struggling to contain the country’s
deficit as he meets with French President Francois Hollande in
Paris today. The European Union is  India ’s largest trading
partner, accounting for 17.2 percent of exports in the six
months ended September 2011, according to the commerce ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
