Iraq will ship 25 cargoes of Basrah
Light crude from the  Persian Gulf  in the second half of October,
compared with 21 two weeks earlier, a final loading program
obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  A total of 36.6 million barrels, or 2.29 million barrels a
day of crude will be exported from the Basrah Oil Terminal,
according to the plan. This compares with 34.4 million barrels,
or 2.29 million a day two weeks earlier.  The schedule for the second half of October comprises 13
lots of 2 million barrels each, eight 1 million-barrel
shipments, and one cargo each of 930,000, 715,000, 556,000 and
444,000 barrels.  A shipping schedule reported by Bloomberg yesterday was not
complete. Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
