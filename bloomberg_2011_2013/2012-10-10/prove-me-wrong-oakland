The Oakland A’s won last night, improbably shutting out Miguel Cabrera and the   Detroit  Tigers to stay alive in the postseason. The crowd was announced as a  sellout -- even though there were close to 20,000 empty upper-deck seats beneath  a large green tarp that the team’s owner, Lew Wolff, refuses to remove, despite  demand from his team’s fans. As I  wrote yesterday , Wolff  is determined to move the A’s to San Jose, a decision that makes undeniable  financial sense. (San Jose recently displaced Detroit as America’s  10 th  largest city; as of 2010, Oakland was  47 th .) Some A’s fans  took  offense  at my argument, and I don’t blame them: This is their team, and they  don’t want to have to drive 41 miles to see them play in a different city. The  Athletics may have started in Philadelphia -- they were a charter  member of the American League -- but they’ve been in Oakland since 1968, and have  accumulated a lot of history there. (Before there was  Moneyball , there was   Billyball ). Most baseball franchises are  privately held businesses; but they are also public trusts. Wolff,  with his apparent disdain for his fan base, seems either not to understand this  or, more likely, not to care. He has a profitable team, worth roughly $140  million more than he paid for it in 2005, and his partner is the heir to the Gap  fortune -- and yet the A’s consistently have one of the lowest payrolls in  baseball. So Wolff gets to have it both  ways: He makes money on the A’s, even as he perpetuates the perception that  Oakland can’t sustain a big-league team. Who suffers? The fans, of  course. Is the A’s lack of fan  support connected to discontent with the ownership of the team? No doubt. Still, since 2006, the A’s best showing,  attendance-wise, was third to last in the American League. If Oakland wants to keep the  A's, its only option is for fans to get out and support the team. Protest  outside the stadium until Wolff agrees to remove the tarp. Order your 2013 season tickets now. I would love to be proved  wrong. (Jonathan Mahler is a sports columnist for Bloomberg View.  Follow  him on Twitter.) Read more breaking commentary from Bloomberg View at  the Ticker .
