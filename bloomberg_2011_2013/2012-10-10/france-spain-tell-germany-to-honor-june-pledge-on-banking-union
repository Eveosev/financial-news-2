French President  Francois Hollande 
and Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  called on nations such
as  Germany  to honor commitments on a banking union made at the
European Council in June.  “We want something as basic as those decisions being
fulfilled,” Rajoy said at a press conference in Paris with his
counterpart.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  has been hedging
his commitment to bringing European lenders together under a
single supervisor, saying yesterday it may not be possible to
meet a Jan. 1 deadline. European leaders called for the measure
in June as a condition for allowing banks in the 17-nation euro
area direct access to the 500 billion-euro ($645 billion)
permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism.  Both Hollande and Rajoy, who held a summit today in the
French capital, insisted the framework should cover all lenders
in the currency union. Schaeuble has called for the biggest
banks to enter first.  “The regulator must be credible, and to be credible it
must have a wide field to cover,” Hollande said.  The comments echo a statement issued alongside Italian
Prime Minister  Mario Monti  as well as the leaders of Portugal
and Cyprus last week, calling for the European Union to meet its
self-imposed deadline. Schaeuble said last month it may take
time to build the supervisory apparatus required, and raised the
prospect of subjecting lenders to stress tests before allowing
them to shelter under the pan-European umbrella.  To contact the reporters on this story:
