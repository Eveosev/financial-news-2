The Czech government approved a
proposal for a so-called financial constitution, which sets
limits on state debt.  The proposal sets long-term rules for governments to manage
public debt and avoid a crisis, Prime Minister Petr Necas said
at a press conference in  Prague  today. It also sets maximum caps
for government debt as well as spending, Necas said.  The proposal would force government to win a confidence
vote in Parliament if public debt exceeds 50 percent of gross
domestic product, Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek said at the
same briefing. The government should take preventive action if
debt rises above 40 percent of GDP, Kalousek added. A newly
established National Budget Council will oversee the
government’s policy as part of the proposal.  The Czech economy is suffering from weak domestic demand
after the government cut investments and raised sales taxes to
trim the  budget deficit . The Czech Republic’s public debt was
43.3 percent of GDP at the end of the third quarter.  The plan would be enshrined in the constitution and has to
be approved by a constitutional majority in Parliament,
according to Kalousek.  To contact the reporter on this story:
