European Central Bank Governing
Council member Jens Weidmann said the ECB must make sure that
the single currency retains its value.  “The central banks of the Eurosystem have the
responsibility to ensure that people continue to be able to hold
good and stable money in their hands,” Weidmann, who heads
 Germany ’s Bundesbank, said in a speech in Frankfurt today. “A
currency can only be stable when citizens have trust in their
central bank and recognize its will to keep prices stable.”  The Bundesbank openly opposes ECB President  Mario Draghi ’s
plan to buy bonds on the secondary market of countries that sign
up to economic adjustment programs, saying it comes too close to
financing governments and risks devaluing the euro through
inflation. Weidmann didn’t explicitly mention the ECB’s bond-
buying policy in his speech today.  Central banks “can more or less create money out of
nothing,” Weidmann said. “That possibility is always bound
with the temptation to ease the financial restrictions of
governments through the printing of money.”  Expectations of central banks increase in times of crisis
and they must have the courage to stick to their stability
principles to keep the hard-won confidence of the public,
Weidmann said.  “To prevent central banks being harnessed into financing
government expenditures, they have to remain independent and
they have to have a mandate that puts the goal of stable money
ahead of all others,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
