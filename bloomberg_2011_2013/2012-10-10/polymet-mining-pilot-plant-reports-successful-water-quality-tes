Polymet Mining Corp. (PLM)  said a reverse
osmosis pilot water treatment plant designed to meet  Minnesota 
quality standards has successfully treated more than 1 million
gallons of water since becoming operational in May.  The pilot plant test “is a significant accomplishment,
demonstrating that water with elevated sulfate levels can be
treated to meet Minnesota’s 10 parts-per-million sulfate
standard for waters used for the production of wild rice,” the
company said today in a statement.  Polymet said it combined with GE Water & Process
Technologies and Barr Engineering to design and operate the
pilot plant using reverse osmosis membrane technology developed
by  General Electric Co. (GE)  Operation of the Northmet pilot
treatment plant to boost efficiencies continues, Polymet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
