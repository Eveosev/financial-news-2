PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  and  Fiat SpA (F)  had
their debt ratings lowered by Moody’s Investors Service, which
cited concerns that the European automakers’ financial health is
deteriorating.  Fiat and Peugeot had their ratings cut one level to Ba3
from Ba2, both with a negative outlook, Moody’s said today in
statements. The rating is three levels below investment grade.  The downgrades affect about 14.9 billion euros ($19
billion) of debt and follow a debt crisis in the region that’s
sapping demand for cars. The  International Monetary Fund  cut its
global growth forecast yesterday and warned of even slower
expansion should European officials fail to address threats to
their economies.  About 9.3 billion euros of Fiat debt and 5.6 billion euros
of Peugeot debt are affected by the rating actions, Moody’s
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
