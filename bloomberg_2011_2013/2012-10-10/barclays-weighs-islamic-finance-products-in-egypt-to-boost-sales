Barclays Bank  Egypt  SAE is
considering entering the Islamic banking market in the country
and lending more to small and medium businesses as it seeks ways
to generate new revenue, a senior bank official said.  The bank is weighing how to replicate its South African
Islamic products in Egypt, where such finance makes as much as
4 percent to 5 percent of total banking assets in the country,
Sherif Elbehery, director for strategy, planning, marketing and
corporate affairs at the Bank in Egypt, said in an interview.  Elbehery said the bank has been studying lending to SMEs
for the last two years, because they make up 70 percent of
economic growth in Egypt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
