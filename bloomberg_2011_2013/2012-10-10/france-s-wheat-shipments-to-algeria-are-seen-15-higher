France shipped 4.6 million metric
tons of wheat to  Algeria  in the 2011-2012 season, 15% more than
a year earlier, according to France Export Cereales.  “We export to Algeria 20 to 25 percent of our annual wheat
production, it’s a very important market for us,” Jean-Pierre
Langlois Berthelot, the Paris-based grain-export lobby’s
president, said in an interview yesterday in Algiers, the
Algerian capital.  Soft wheat made up 80 percent of the shipments, and the
rest was the durum variety, he said.  Algeria is Africa’s second-largest wheat importer after
 Egypt , according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
