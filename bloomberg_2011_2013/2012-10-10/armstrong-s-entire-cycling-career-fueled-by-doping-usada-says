Seven-time Tour de  France  winner
Lance Armstrong’s entire cycling career was fueled by
performance-enhancing drugs, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said in
a summary of its case against him.  Armstrong also required teammates to use banned substances
or he would dismiss them from his squad, the report says. He
also paid Michele Ferrari, a physician who played a “major
role” in his doping program, $1 million, the report says.  Armstrong, 41, won the Tour de France every year from
1999-2005 with the U.S. Postal Service and Discovery teams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
