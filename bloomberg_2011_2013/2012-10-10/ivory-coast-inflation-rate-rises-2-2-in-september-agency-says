Consumer prices in  Ivory Coast , the
world’s biggest cocoa producer, rose 2.2 percent in September
from a year earlier as food and housing costs increased, the
country’s National Institute of Statistics said.  Inflation accelerated 1.9 percent in August, the Abidjan-
based statistics office said in an e-mailed statement today.
Prices rose 0.1 percent in the month.  Ivory Coast, the biggest economy in the eight-member West
African monetary union, is recovering from a post-election
crisis in 2011 that largely halted exports, shut banks and shops
and forced the stock exchange to relocate to  Mali . After
contracting 4.7 percent last year, the nation’s economy is
expected to grow 8.6 percent in 2012, the  International Monetary
Fund  said on Oct. 3.  Food price increased 2.4 percent from 1.8 percent in August
while prices for housing and utilities increased 3 percent from
a year earlier, the agency said. Transportation costs rose 2.3
percent while health-care prices fell 1 percent, it said.
Communication costs rose 2.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
