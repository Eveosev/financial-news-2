Thailand ’s baht declined to a one-
week low as concern that global growth is slowing worsened the
nation’s export outlook. Government bonds held steady.  The International Monetary Fund cut its world expansion
forecast for this year to 3.3 percent yesterday, the least since
the 2009 recession, from a July prediction of 3.5 percent,
citing an intensifying  European debt crisis  and a weaker U.S.
economy. The Washington-based lender also lowered its estimate
for  China , Thailand’s largest overseas market.  “Asian nations like Thailand and Malaysia that depend on
exports will see a bigger negative impact from the slowdown in
external demand,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the
Japan Center for Economic Research in  Tokyo . “Sentiment for the
regional currencies will remain weak for now as growth concerns
were highlighted by the IMF.”  The baht fell 0.2 percent to 30.72 per dollar as of 3:14
p.m. in Bangkok and touched 30.75 earlier, the weakest level
since Oct. 3, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was unchanged at 4.27 percent.  Thai  exports  declined for a third month in August, falling
7 percent from a year earlier, government data show.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 was
steady at 3.26 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
