The ruble advanced as oil,  Russia ’s
main export earner, gained and companies started buying the
domestic currency ahead of tax payments due next week.  The ruble gained 0.2 percent against the dollar to 31.0990
at 7 p.m. in Moscow, erasing losses of as much as 0.2 percent
earlier in the day. The Russian currency rose 0.1 percent versus
the euro to 40.1275 and was 0.2 percent up against the central
bank’s euro-dollar target basket.  Oil gained 1.3 percent to $93.54 per barrel in  New York 
after earlier declines on concern that escalating tension in the
 Middle East  will disrupt supplies in a region responsible for
more than a third of global output. Oil and gas account for
about 50 percent of Russia’s government revenue.  “The main reason is oil,” Igor Akinshin, a currency
trader at Moscow-based  Alfa Bank  said by phone. “Also the tax
period is ahead. We have seen some purchase of the ruble.”  Russian exporters began selling dollars to pay government
taxes next week, giving support to the ruble, Dmitry Polevoy, a
Moscow-based economist at ING Groep NV, said an e-mailed note
today. Companies are due to pay about 900 billion rubles ($29
billion) including in corporate profit tax and mineral
extraction tax over the next two weeks, he said.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.5578 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.6405 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell five basis points to 185,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
