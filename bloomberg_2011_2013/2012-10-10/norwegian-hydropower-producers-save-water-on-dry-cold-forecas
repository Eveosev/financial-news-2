Forecasts for drier, cooler weather
means Norwegian hydropower producers have more incentive to save
water for later use and run less volume through turbines, the
country’s water and energy directorate said.  The latest forecasts point to cool and dry weather as
runoff this week may total 1.9 terawatt-hours, 70 percent of the
seasonal average, along with rain amounts equivalent to 1
terawatt-hour or 30 percent of average, the agency said today in
a website  report .  “This may explain why hydropower production has dropped in
the past week,” the report said to describe the Oct. 1 to Oct.
7 period. Dry weather also makes it economical for hydropower
producers to store water for later use, which may prop up power
prices, according to the directorate.  Norway get as much as 99 percent of its power needs by
running water through turbines while the Nordic region as a
whole gets half its power use from hydroelectricity.  Norway produced 2,568 gigawatt-hours of power last week,
down 3.4 percent from a week earlier. Combined with rising
runoff at rivers, this helped hydro reservoir levels climb 0.5
percentage points to 91.6 percent full last week, 4.3 percentage
points above the seasonal median and 4 percentage points higher
than a year ago, according to the directorate.  Norway has seen 97.0 terawatt-hours of rain this year, 3.0
terawatt-hours above average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
