OPEC boosted estimates of the amount
of crude it will need to supply next year after trimming
forecasts for oil production from outside the group.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said in a
monthly report that its 12 members will need to provide an
average of 29.8 million barrels a day in 2013, about 200,000
more than estimated last month. The group reduced its forecast
for output from outside the group for next year by the same
amount, to 53.89 million barrels because of lower-than-expected
growth in emerging nations. Still, world markets will remain
“characterized by high volumes of crude supply and increasing
production capacity,” the organization said.  “The outlook for production from  India  and other  Africa  in
2013 were revised down on the back of updated data in 2012,
which provided an insight into the expectations for 2013,”
OPEC’s Vienna-based secretariat said today in its Monthly Oil
Market Report.  Brent crude futures have advanced 6 percent this year, as
concern that tensions with  Iran  and violence in  Syria  may lead
to wider supply losses counter signs that the economic recovery
is faltering. Saudi Arabian Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said
yesterday that prices for Brent, trading near $114 a barrel
today, are “still high” and that the kingdom would prefer a
level of $100.  Global Demand  OPEC kept its forecast for global oil demand in 2013
unchanged, predicting that consumption will increase by 780,000
barrels a day, or 0.9 percent, to 89.6 million a day. Growth in
non-OPEC supply coupled with natural gas liquids has outpaced
demand this year, a trend that will probably to continue into
next year, the group said.  Non-OPEC producers will increase output by 890,000 barrels
a day next year, driven by growth in the U.S. and  Canada ,
according to OPEC.  OPEC production fell by 265,000 barrels a day last month to
31.08 million a day, according to secondary sources cited by the
report. That’s 410,000 a day more than the average amount the
group considers needed to meet their customers’ requirements
this quarter, and about 1 million more than the target members
reaffirmed at their last meeting in June.  Oil inventories held by companies in the most
industrialized nations were 46 million barrels below their five-
year average in August after dropping “sharply” to 2.67
billion barrels, according to the report. In the U.S., the
world’s largest consumer of crude, stockpiles were 28.6 million
barrels higher than their five-year mean at 364.7 million.  OPEC’s members are Algeria,  Angola ,  Ecuador , Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. The organization is next scheduled to
meet on Dec. 12 in Vienna.  The  International Energy Agency , a Paris-based adviser to
consuming nations, will release its monthly report on global oil
supply and demand on Oct. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
