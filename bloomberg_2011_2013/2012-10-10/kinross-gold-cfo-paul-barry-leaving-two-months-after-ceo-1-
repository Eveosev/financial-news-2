Kinross Gold Corp. (K) , the Canadian
gold producer that fired its chief executive officer two months
ago, said Chief Financial Officer Paul Barry will leave the
company.  Barry, 54, who has been CFO since March 2011, will pursue
other interests, Toronto-based Kinross said today in a
statement. He’ll remain in the role until a replacement is
appointed and will assist the new CFO during an agreed
transition period, the company said.  Kinross,  Canada ’s third-largest gold producer by sales,
said Aug. 1 that it promoted J. Paul Rollinson, previously vice
president of corporate development, to replace Tye Burt as CEO.
In February, the company took a $2.49 billion writedown on the
Tasiast mine in  Mauritania , an asset it had acquired 17 months
earlier in its C$8 billion ($8.2 billion) takeover of Red Back
Mining Inc. A companywide review to cut costs may require
“tough decisions,” Rollinson said Aug. 9.  Barry is the latest senior gold-mining executive to get
replaced this year as shareholders demand greater returns.
Bloomberg has reported that five of the top 20 Canadian gold
producers have named new CEOs in 2012, the fastest replacement
rate in at least a decade.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Global Gold Index, including 57
gold companies, rose 0.7 percent to 339.79 at 11:07 a.m. The
index is down 5.7 percent this year.  In mid-August, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold and
Silver Index, another equities barometer, reached its lowest
level relative to the price of gold in 28 years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gold fell 2.5 percent to $1,760.50 an ounce at 10:33 a.m.
in  New York .  Kinross rose 1.3 percent to C$10.31 at 10:45 a.m. in
Toronto. The stock has dropped 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
