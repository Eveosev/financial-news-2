Relatives of people killed in a 2004
plane crash sued China Eastern Airlines Corp., its parent,
 Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  and  General Electric Co. (GE)  for 132 million  yuan 
($21 million), Beijing News said, citing the families’ lawyer.  The group is also seeking a detailed crash report, public
apologies and a monument at the accident site, lawyer Hao Junbo
said, according to the  newspaper . Hearings began yesterday in
the Beijing Second Intermediate People’s Court, the report said.  The case centers on a November 2004 crash in which a
Bombardier CRJ-200 plane operated by China Eastern plunged into
a frozen lake in the northern city of Baotou, shortly after
takeoff, killing 55. The plane crash was the nation’s deadliest
since 2002, according to the Aviation Safety Network  website .  China Eastern and engine-maker GE declined to comment.
Bombardier didn’t immediately reply to e-mails from Bloomberg
News. The case was accepted by the court in 2009, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
