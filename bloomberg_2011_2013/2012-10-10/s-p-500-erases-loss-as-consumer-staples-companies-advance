U.S. stocks erased losses as Wal-
Mart Stores Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp. led consumer-staples
companies higher, overshadowing a drop in commodity producers
after Alcoa Inc. cut its forecast for aluminum demand.  Costco jumped 4.5 percent after the largest warehouse-club
chain’s earnings topped estimates as low prices drove sales.
Wal-Mart surged 2.5 percent after saying its back-to-school
sales were “very strong.” Alcoa lost 2.6 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up less than 0.1
percent at 1,442.41 at 10:31 a.m. in  New York  after dropping as
much as 0.3 percent earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
