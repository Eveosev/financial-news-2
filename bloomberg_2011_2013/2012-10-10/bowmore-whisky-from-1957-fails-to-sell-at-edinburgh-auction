A bottle of 54-year-old Bowmore
whisky failed to sell at an auction in Edinburgh today because
no buyer was willing to meet the minimum price.  The hammer came down at 85,000 pounds ($136,000), short of
the 100,000-pound reserve price,  auctioneer Bonhams  said. The
sale would have set a record for a Scotch at auction. The
Bowmore 1957, the oldest whisky released by the distiller, was
bottled in 2011 and only a dozen are in existence. A second is
scheduled to go on sale in  New York  on Oct. 28.  “The skill and patience that has gone into the production
of this product has not been appreciated by the market,” said
Martin Green, the whisky specialist at Bonhams.  Bowmore was founded in 1779 on Islay off  Scotland ’s west
coast. Whiskies from the island, also including Lagavulin and
Laphroaig, are known for their peaty smokiness.  The whisky was presented in a hand-blown platinum encrusted
decanter. According to the tasting notes, it has initial flavors
of blueberries, cassis, figs, sea salt and eucalyptus followed
by dark chocolate and grapefruit leaving the drinker with an
aftertaste of bergamot and star anise.  The net proceeds of both sales were to go to five Scottish
charities, Bowmore said last month.  A bottle of 55-year-old Glenfiddich malt whisky produced to
honor the oldest living Scot sold at auction on Dec. 14 in
Edinburgh for a record 46,850 pounds. The whisky, which was put
into casks in 1955, had a guide price of between 30,000 and
35,000 pounds and all the proceeds were donated to Water Aid.  Muse highlights include  Mark Beech  on art and  James Russell 
on architecture.  To contact the reporter of the story:
