Nigeria said it found oil in its
inland basins as  Africa ’s biggest producer of crude stepped up
exploration after missing targets to raise reserves and output.  “We are determined to further develop on these findings
and expand the scope of such explorations,” President Goodluck Jonathan told lawmakers today in the capital of Abuja. In 2013,
the government plans to spend 16 billion naira ($102 million)
exploring for oil in the inland basins, Jonathan said.  Africa’s most populous nation gets more than 95 percent of
its foreign-exchange income from oil exports. The West African
nation, with an average daily output of 2.4 million barrels, is
targeting 40 billion barrels of crude reserves by 2020, up from
37 billion barrels now, Andrew Yakubu, group managing director
of state-owned  Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. , said Oct. 8.  That was after Nigeria missed plans to boost reserves to 40
billion barrels by 2010 and output to 4 million barrels a day.  At least 90 percent of Nigerian crude is pumped from the
oil-rich Niger River delta by  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Exxon Mobil
Corp.,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Total SA (FP)  and  Eni SpA (ENI)  in joint ventures
with the state oil company. New finds were made in four inland
basins including Anambra, Chad, Yola and the Benue Trough and
the state-owned petroleum company is leading the exploration.  To contact the reporters on this story:
