Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ) , the bankrupt
photography pioneer, reached a deal to resolve a $1.2 billion
liability stemming from retiree benefits that it will terminate
at the end of the year.  The agreement between Kodak and a committee representing
retirees will give the committee a $7.5 million cash payment, a
$635 million unsecured claim in Kodak’s bankruptcy case and an
additional claim of $15 million, Kodak said today in a
statement.  The Rochester, New York-based company said the move “will
pose challenges for retirees.”  Kodak’s retiree benefits program covers medical, dental,
life insurance and survivor income benefits, Kodak said. Kodak
will terminate the benefits as of Dec. 31. Kodak’s U.S. benefits
liability exceeded $1.2 billion as of Dec. 31, 2011, according
to the statement.  The bankruptcy case is In re Eastman Kodak Co., 12-10202,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  Editors: Fred Strasser, Michael Hytha  To contact the reporter on this story:
