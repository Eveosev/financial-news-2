South Africa ’s Treasury may call for
tenders for a new electronic bond-trading system to improve
transparency in the 1.45 trillion-rand ($170 billion) market,
replacing one where prices are set mostly over the phone.  The National Treasury held discussions with  World Bank 
consultants over the past couple of months on introducing
electronic market trading, Roy Havemann, chief director in the
department’s tax and financial sector policy unit, said by phone
from  Pretoria . JSE Ltd., operator of the country’s stock and
bond exchanges, will be required to tender for the new system if
it is adopted.  “The JSE is very well placed to operate this platform, but
equally other providers would also be well placed,” Havemann
said. “It will be a competitive process.”  The Treasury consulted with the JSE, bond traders, primary
dealers and interbroker dealers and provided feedback on
discussions held with the World Bank, Havemann said.  “We haven’t put out a paper yet, but we have had
consultations with the industry as part of the Bond Market
Development Committee,” he said.  JSE Ltd. (JSE)  said it will be able to introduce electronic
trading if required.  “Whichever way National Treasury decides to go, the JSE
believes it will be able to cater for all the envisaged
requirements that they require,” Warren Geers, general manager
of trading for interest-rate products and derivatives, said in
an e-mailed response to Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
