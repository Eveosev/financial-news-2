Australia ’s dollar rose for a third
straight day against its U.S. counterpart as the government’s
sale of its longest-ever bond maturity signaled strong demand
for the South Pacific country’s debt.  Money-market rates in  China , Australia’s biggest trade
partner, dropped for a second day yesterday on speculation cash
supply will increase as the central bank adds funds to the
financial system.  New Zealand ’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi,
weakened versus most major peers as global stocks declined amid
lower risk appetite.  “You had a better-than-expected government bond sale in
Australia,” Ravi Bharadwaj, a market analyst in  Washington  at
Western Union Business Solutions, a unit of Western Union Co.,
said in a telephone interview. “You also have a backdrop of
expectations that Chinese authorities will do what’s needed to
boost local demand.”  The Australian dollar appreciated 0.3 percent to $1.0234
yesterday in New York. It touched $1.0149 on Oct. 8, the lowest
since July 13. The Aussie rose 0.2 percent to 80.02 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, declined 0.2
percent to 81.63 U.S. cents and reached 81.46 cents, the lowest
level since Sept. 11. The kiwi fell 0.3 percent to 63.83 yen.  The MSCI  World Index (MXWO)  of equities retreated 0.6 percent
after Alcoa Inc. said slowing growth in China will cut global
demand for aluminum.  Bond Sale  Australia’s A$3.25 billion ($3.3 billion) of notes due in
April 2029 priced to yield 3.595 percent, the country’s Office
of Financial Management said. That compares with 3.24 percent on
the U.K.’s July 2052 gilt, the highest rate outside Australia
among sovereign debt with top credit scores from all three major
ratings companies.  The offering matched the amount of April 2027 bonds sold in
October 2011. Australia’s previous longest bond was the 2027
line.  The nation’s benchmark  cash rate  target is 3.25 percent,
compared with a range of zero to 0.25 percent in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
