The average American with an
undergraduate business degree will earn $2.6 million over a
lifetime, about $200,000 more than the average for all people
with a bachelorâ€™s degree.  The payoff is even better for engineers, who the U.S.
Census Bureau  reported  today had the highest average lifetime
earnings for college-educated graduates. They can expect to earn
$3.5 million during a 40-year career.  Computer or mathematics undergraduates reported earning
$3.1 million during that time, the  Census Bureau  said in its
report based on 2011 American Community Survey data.  The average lifetime earnings for business majors was tied
with the $2.6 million figure for people holding undergraduate
degrees in unspecified science-related fields and people who
majored in physical sciences.  Education was the least lucrative of college undergraduate
degrees. The average teacher earns $1.8 million during his or
her career.  Psychology and arts majors earned an average of $2 million.
Liberal arts and literature undergraduate degree holders said
they averaged $2.1 million. Biological sciences majors and
communications-degree holders were tied at $2.3 million. Social
science majors reported lifetime earnings of $2.5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
