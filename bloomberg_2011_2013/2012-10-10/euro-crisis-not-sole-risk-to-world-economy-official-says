The euro region’s sovereign-debt
crisis isn’t the only development posing risks to the global
economy, a German government official said.  Threats from the U.S. and  Japan  also must be considered at
an international meeting of finance officials in  Tokyo  this
week, the official said in Berlin today, speaking on condition
of anonymity according to government protocol.  The German government wants to engage in a fair and
balanced perspective of global economic development, in which
Europe will play a role along with other regions, including the
so-called BRIC bloc, the official said before German Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  travels to Tokyo for the meeting.  Schaeuble will make the point at international discussions
that monetary-policy tools can’t solve problems in the long run
and that fiscal and structural adjustments are needed to return
countries to sustainable fiscal positions, the official said.  The German finance chief will explain to international
partners the role of the European Stability Mechanism, the euro
region’s permanent financial backstop, in building confidence in
Europe’s crisis-solving ability and why the process of setting
it up was delayed in  Germany . Euro countries must adhere to
rules established by the bloc’s fiscal pact on deficit
limitations, the official said.  Crisis management efforts mustn’t keep European Union
members from discussing the path toward economic, fiscal and
political union, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
