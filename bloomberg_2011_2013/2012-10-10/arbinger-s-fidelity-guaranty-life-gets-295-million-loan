Fidelity & Guaranty Life, the
insurance company owned by  Harbinger Group Inc., (HRG)  got $295
million of credit to replace financing provided by its former
owner  Old Mutual plc. (OML)   Nomura Holdings Inc. is providing Fidelity & Guaranty the
loan, which matures in five years, Harbinger, a diversified
holding company based in New York, said today in a statement
distributed by  Thomson Reuters .  The company has “eliminated the last remaining credit
support by its former owner, more than three years ahead of our
obligation and at a lower financing cost,” Phil Gass,
Harbinger’s vice president of investments, said in the
statement.  Harbinger completed the purchase of  Fidelity & Guaranty ,
based in Baltimore, from Old Mutual in April 2011, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
