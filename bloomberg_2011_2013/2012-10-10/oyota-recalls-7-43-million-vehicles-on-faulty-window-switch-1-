Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  began recalling
about 7.43 million vehicles worldwide after the company detected
a possible flaw that could lead the power-window switch to melt
or catch fire.  The recall affects about 2.47 million vehicles in the U.S.,
1.4 million in China and 1.39 million in  Europe , said Joichi Tachikawa, a Tokyo-based spokesman. The Corolla and Camry are
among the 14 models -- some produced as far back as 2007 --
subject to inspection and repair, he said. The company hasn’t
received any reports of accidents because of the issue, he said.  The scale of the recall, equivalent to 93 percent of its
vehicles sold last year, comes as President Akio Toyoda pushes
to rebuild the company’s reputation for quality. Toyota, which
recalled more than 10 million units in 2009 and 2010 for defects
associated with unintended acceleration, took two years for its
Lexus brand to regain the top spot on J.D. Power & Associates’
new-car quality survey in 2011.  “The volume is big, and doesn’t look good,”  Satoru Takada , a Tokyo-based auto analyst at Toward the Infinite World
Inc., a securities research company, said by telephone today.
“Even if you calculate the cost in a very simple way, it’s
going to be significant. What comes with standardizing platforms
and parts is that these recalls become immense.”  Toyota, based in Toyota City,  Japan , didn’t provide
estimates on the cost of the recall. Its stock fell for a third
day in Tokyo trading, dropping 1.9 percent to 2,943 yen, its
lowest close since July 27.  ‘Sticky’ Switch  The recall involves about 490,000 vehicles in the Middle
East, 240,000 in  Canada  and about 650,000 in Asia, excluding
Japan and China, Tachikawa said.  The recall centers on the driver’s side power-window master
switch, which may feel “notchy or sticky” and prompt users to
apply commercial lubricants. That may result in melting, cause
smoke and lead to a fire, according to Toyota.  The company said it’s conducting the recall to inspect the
vehicles and apply special fluorine grease to the switch.  “It’s not something that would cause any deadly accidents
like the recall of 2009, so I do not think it would affect the
company’s profit or share price,” said Satoshi Yuzaki, Tokyo-
based general manager at Takagi Securities Co. “Investors are
focusing more on sales in  China , and not reacting much to this
recall.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
