China  may become the world’s
wealthiest country by household assets after the U.S. in five
years as the nation’s middle-class consumers grow richer,  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  forecast.  The nation will add $18 trillion in household wealth by
2017, taking its total to $38 trillion, according to the bank’s
global wealth report today. That would surpass Japan’s $35
trillion, and be less than half of the U.S.’s $89 trillion.  China, which is embroiled in a territorial dispute with
Japan over islands in the  East China Sea , surpassed its Asian
rival to become the world’s second-largest economy in the second
quarter of 2010. It had annual gross domestic product of $7.3
trillion at the end of last year, compared with  Japan ’s $5.9
trillion.  “If we look at the very top end of the wealth pyramid, in
terms of billionaires and ultra-high net worth individuals,
China is expected to have a higher number of these high wealth
holders than Japan,” said Fan Cheuk Wan, head of Asia-Pacific
research for Credit Suisse’s private bank. “This is mainly
related to continual capital-market reforms and privatization of
the economy.”  Japan and China are each claiming the islands, called
Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese, since Japan moved to
buy the islands from their private owner last month. The
territorial dispute has clouded a trade relationship between
 Asia ’s two largest economies that has tripled in the past decade
to more than $340 billion.  Household wealth in the Asia-Pacific region will rise 55
percent to $115 trillion by 2017, Credit Suisse forecast,
accounting for 35 percent of global wealth.  From mid-2011 to mid-2012, global wealth declined 5.2
percent to $223 trillion, mainly due to the euro-area’s debt
crisis, said Fan. That’s the fastest decline since 2008, when it
shrank 14.6 percent, she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
