French 10-year bonds advanced for a
third day, outperforming benchmark German bunds, as investors
bought the securities before existing debt matures this month.  Belgian securities rallied, sending 10-year yields to a
record low, and Austrian debt also gained. Spanish bonds rose
for the first time in three days as Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
traveled to Paris to meet French President  Francois Hollande .
German five-year notes slipped after the nation sold 3.1 billion
euros ($4 billion) of the securities. Italy auctioned 8 billion
euros of 12-month bills and 3 billion euros of three-month debt.  “Market focus is in the semi-core space at the moment,”
said Norbert Aul, a rates strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in
 London , referring to the debt from countries with a rating below
the top AAA grade. “France is rallying before redemptions.
Austria and  Belgium  are going along with that.”  French 10-year yields fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.20 percent at 4:19 p.m. London time. The
2.25 percent bond maturing in October 2022 rose 0.30, or 3 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.43. The yield difference, or
 spread , over similar-maturity German bunds dropped by six basis
points to 70 basis points, after touching 82 basis points on
Oct. 5, the most since Sept. 4.  France  is due to pay back more than 20 billion euros of a
4.75 percent bond on Oct. 25, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Belgian Records  Belgian  10-year yields  fell four basis points to reach
2.387 percent, an all-time low, with 30-year yields dropping to
3.227 percent, also a record. Austrian 10-year rates declined
one basis point to 2 percent.  The yield  spread  between Belgian 10-year government bonds
and their German equivalents narrowed three basis points to 92
basis points.  Belgium has sold about 34.9 billion euros of notes and
bonds so far this year, relative to a target of 38.25 billion
euros, which was increased by the debt agency in September.  “Markets have cottoned on to the fact that there’s only a
little bit of issuance left to go and that’s helping the
bonds,” said  Harvinder Sian , a senior fixed-income strategist
at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London. “Belgium is not
the most liquid of the euro-region markets.”  German Auction  Germany  sold five-year notes today at a yield of 0.53
percent. It last sold the securities at an average yield of 0.61
percent on Sept. 12. That compares with a  record-low  auction
yield of 0.31 percent in August.  Germany’s five-year yield was little changed at 0.54
percent, after falling three basis points over the past two
days. The 10-year bund yield increased two basis points to 1.50
percent.  Spain ’s 10-year bond yield fell two basis points to 5.81
percent, and the rate on similar-maturity Italian debt declined
one basis point to 5.10 percent.  Volatility on Ireland’s  government bonds  was the highest in
developed markets today, followed by  Portugal , according to
measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two- and 10-year
securities, and credit default swaps.  Ireland’s bond maturing in October 2020 rose, pushing the
yield down seven basis points to 4.95 percent, the  lowest level 
since August 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  German bonds returned 3.1 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities advanced 1.5 percent, while French and Belgian debt
earned 8.3 percent, and 14 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporters on this story:
