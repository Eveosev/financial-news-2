President Vladimir Putin said a
multi-billion-dollar arms contract with Iraq, making  Russia  the
second-biggest weapons supplier to the Middle Eastern state
after the U.S., showed trust in Russian military equipment.  “We are restoring military cooperation,” Putin said today
after talks outside Moscow with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al- Maliki. “Iraqi specialists know Russian weapons very well, and
we will find mutual understanding in this sphere that will
increase not only trade volumes but confidence.”  Iraq will purchase more than $4.2 billion of weapons from
Russia under contracts signed in recent months, the Russian
government said yesterday, in a challenge to the Middle Eastern
country’s military ties to the U.S. If fulfilled, the contracts
would lead to Russian military advisers and technicians working
in  Iraq  as they did during the Soviet era, according to Alexei Malashenko, an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center.  Iraq is buying 30 Russian MI-28 attack helicopters, worth
$2 billion, along with 42 Pantsir short-to-medium-range surface-
to-air missile and anti-aircraft artillery weapon systems, worth
$2.3 billion, according to Russian state broadcaster RT. The
country may also purchase Russian MiG fighter jets as well as
armored vehicles, RT said.  The deals are the biggest military contacts since the 2003
U.S.-led overthrow of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Since then,
the country spent about $300 million on Russian Mi-17 military
transport helicopters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
