Treasuries held a gain from
yesterday as investors prepared to bid for $21 billion in 10-
year notes after a three-year sale drew record demand.  A decline in stocks around the world helped buoy bonds, and
Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said U.S. securities
are regarded as a haven. The Fed is scheduled to issue its Beige
Book business survey today, after Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
last week the central bank’s debt-buying program is needed to
spur employment.  “Money should be coming into safe-haven assets, and that
is  U.S. Treasuries ,” said Tomohisa Fujiki, an  interest-rate 
strategist in  Tokyo  at BNP Paribas SA, whose  New York  unit is
one of the 21 primary dealers obliged to bid at U.S. debt sales.
“Equities are not doing well.”  Benchmark 10-year notes  yielded  1.72 percent as of 7:16
a.m. in  London , based on Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The record
low was 1.38 percent on July 25. The price of the 1.625 percent
security due in August 2022 was 99 5/32 today. Ten-year rates
have fallen from 1.74 percent at the end of last week.  The MSCI All-Country World Index of shares slid 0.2
percent. It dropped 1.5 percent over the previous two days, the
steepest back-to-back decline in almost two weeks.  Japan ’s 10-year yield was little changed at 0.765 percent,
versus this year’s low of 0.72 percent.  Weak Economy  Yellen, speaking today at an International Monetary Fund
meeting in Tokyo, also said “low inflation” and “weakness in
the  U.S. economy ” have pushed yields down.  The Fed announced Sept. 13 it will keep the main interest
rate at almost zero until at least mid-2015 and buy $40 billion
of mortgage debt every month in a third round of so-called
quantitative easing. The central bank is also swapping shorter-
term Treasuries in its holdings for longer maturities. It plans
to sell as much as $8 billion of debt due from April 2014 to
February 2015 today as part of the plan, according to the Fed
Bank of New York  website .  U.S. consumer prices rose 1.7 percent in August from the
year before, according to the latest figures from the Labor
Department. The rate has slowed from 3.8 percent in August 2011.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
debt, was 2.55 percent.  The IMF said European  banks  may need to sell as much as
$4.5 trillion in assets through 2013 if policy makers fall short
of pledges to stem the fiscal crisis, up 18 percent from its
April estimate.  Economic Improvement  There are signs of improvement in the U.S. economy, as
President  Barack Obama  and challenger  Mitt Romney  prepare to
face off in a Nov. 6 election.  U.S. unemployment declined to 7.8 percent in September from
8.1 percent the month before, the Labor Department reported Oct.
5. Existing-home sales and retail sales were both stronger in
August than analysts projected, industry and government reports
showed last month.  The $32 billion three-year sale yesterday drew a  bid-to-
cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with
the amount of securities offered, of 3.96. The figure topped the
previous high last month of 3.94.  Investors at the last auction of 2022 debt on Sept. 12 bid
for 2.85 times the amount of debt available, versus the average
of 3.11 for the past 10 auctions of the maturity.  Record Demand  The U.S. has attracted a record $3.16 in bids for each
dollar of the $1.59 trillion of securities it has sold in 2012
as of last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
exceeds the previous high of $3.04 set last year.  The government is scheduled to conclude this week’s sales
with $13 billion of 30-year bonds tomorrow. With the so-called
long-bond  yield  little changed at 2.93 percent today, Tomoya Masanao at Pacific Investment Management Co. said investors
should avoid the securities when rates are less than 3 percent.  Investors should favor intermediate maturities, Masanao
said at a conference in Tokyo today. Pimco, based in  Newport
Beach ,  California , has $1.82 trillion under management including
the world’s biggest bond fund.  Treasury 10-year notes have returned 3.7 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. Three-year debt advanced 0.5 percent, while 30-year
bonds gained 1.6 percent, the data show.  While stocks fell this week, the  MSCI All-Country World
Index (MXWD)  has rallied 14 percent in 2012, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  High Yield  High-yield bonds are attractive, according to Columbia
Management Investment Advisers LLC, which is based in  Boston  and
manages $331 billion.  Returns may be in the “mid single digit range” over the
next 12 months, Jennifer Ponce De Leon, a portfolio manager,
wrote on the company’s  website  Oct. 8.  High-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service and less than BBB- at  Standard & Poor’s .  Schroders Plc (SDR) , which is based in London and oversees $305.1
billion, said corporate bonds and emerging market debt should
prosper.  Fed efforts to put downward pressure on borrowing costs
will intensify the search for yield, Keith Wade, the chief
economist, wrote on the company’s  website  Oct 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
