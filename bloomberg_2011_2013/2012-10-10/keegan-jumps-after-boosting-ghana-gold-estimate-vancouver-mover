Keegan Resources Inc. (KGN) , a Canadian
metals exploration company, rose the most in three years after
increasing its estimate for the amount of gold at the Esaase
project in  Ghana .  Keegan soared 18 percent to C$3.58 at the close in Toronto
after earlier gaining 21 percent, the most intraday since Jan.
23, 2009.  Esaase has a so-called measured and indicated gold resource
of 3.83 million ounces with an average ore grade of 1.73 grams a
ton, the company said today in a statement. That compares with a
September 2011 estimate of 3.64 million ounces at a grade of 1.1
grams a ton.  The revision to the ore grade is “very significant -- a
massive increase,” Nicholas Campbell, a Vancouver-based analyst
at Canaccord Genuity Corp. who has a “speculative buy”
recommendation on the shares, said by telephone.  The estimates increased because Keegan decided to
“selectively mine” the deposit, the company said. Keegan will
announce an updated mine plan in about a month, John Eren, the
company’s Vancouver-based manager of  investor relations , said
today by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
