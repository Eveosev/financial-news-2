Four Athletics pitchers held the
 Detroit  Tigers to four hits as Oakland won 2-0 tonight to avoid
elimination in an American League Division Series.  Detroit still holds a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five Major
League Baseball playoff series, with Game 4 set for tomorrow in
Oakland.  Brett Anderson allowed two hits and struck out six in six
scoreless innings to get the win for the Aâ€™s in his first start
since he strained an abdominal muscle on Sept. 19. Ryan Cook,
Sean Doolittle and Grant Balfour each then added a scoreless
inning in relief for Oakland.  Seth Smith hit a solo homer and Yoenis Cespedes had a run-
scoring single for the Athletics.  In the National League, the San Francisco Giants stayed
alive with a 2-1 win in 10 innings against the Cincinnati Reds.
The Giants, who scored the decisive run on an error by Reds
third baseman Scott Rolen, trail 2-1 in the series, with Game 4
set for tomorrow in Cincinnati.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
