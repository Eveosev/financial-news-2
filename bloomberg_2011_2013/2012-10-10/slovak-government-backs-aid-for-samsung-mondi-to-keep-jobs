Slovakia’s government agreed to
grant state aid to  Samsung Electronics (005930) ,  Mondi (MNDI)  Ltd. and eight
other companies after they pledged new investment to create or
maintain jobs.  Samsung will receive 19.8 million euros ($25.6 million) in
tax breaks in exchange for a 70 million-euro upgrade of its
Slovak factory, which shall preserve 760 jobs, according to a
document posted on the government’s website after today’s
Cabinet meeting. The Slovak unit of Mondi, a paper and packaging
company, will get aid worth 25.4 million euros tied to a 95
million-euro investment project preserving 766 jobs.  The administration of Premier  Robert Fico  is trying to
balance a need to stimulate the  economy  and prevent job losses
with efforts to cut fiscal deficit to prevent contagion from the
euro-region debt crisis.  The Cabinet approved the aid mainly in form of tax breaks,
which will be granted after 2013 not to threaten the country’s
commitment to squeeze the fiscal gap below the European Union’s
limit as early as next year.  The remaining eight investors receiving a total of 76
million euros in aid are car-part makers  Continental AG (CON) , Magneti
Marelli SpA, Zizala Litchsysteme GMBH,  Bekaert NV (BEKB) ,  Spain ’s metal
maker Fagor Ederlan,  Delta Electronics Thailand PCL (2308) ,  Muehlbauer
Holding AG (MUB) , a maker of smart cards and Ekoltech SRO, a local
supplier of Ikea AB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
