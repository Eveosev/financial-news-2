Egypt’s inflation rate fell in
September to the lowest level in at least two years as the
economy struggles to rebound from the uprising that ousted
President  Hosni Mubarak  last year.  Inflation in urban areas, the gauge monitored by the
central bank, slowed to 6.2 percent from 6.5 percent in August,
the official statistics agency said. It was the lowest inflation
rate since Aug. 2010 when Bloomberg started to track the current
series. Consumer prices rose 1.2 percent from the previous
month.  “This confirms that the level of private spending is
reduced, and is outweighing the impact of higher  oil prices .”
 Mona Mansour , co-head of research at Cairo-based investment bank
CI Capital Holding, said by phone.  The inflation rate was less than CI Capital’s 6.7 percent
forecast.  Clothing and footwear prices rose 2.9 percent from the
year-ago month. Housing and utility prices rose 2.7 percent,
that’s less than half August’s 6.7 percent. Food and beverage
prices, the biggest component of the  consumer price index ,
increased 9.3 percent from a year earlier after gaining 8.2
percent in August.  Oil prices have gained 10 percent this year. The U.S.
benchmark oil, West Texas Intermediate, slipped 36 cents to
$92.03 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile at 8:21 a.m. in
London.  Economic growth in Egypt fell to 1.8 percent in 2011, a 19-
year low, and a median estimate of 13 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg shows gross domestic product is expected to expand 2
percent this year. International reserves have fallen to $15
billion, or more than 50 percent below their levels in the month
before the start of the January 2011 uprising.  Egypt is facing the  Middle East ’s widest budget deficit,
and officials have said they are seeking to secure a $4.8
billion International Monetary Fund loan this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
