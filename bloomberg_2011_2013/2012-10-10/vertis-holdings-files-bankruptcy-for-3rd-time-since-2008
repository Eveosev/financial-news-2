Vertis Holdings Inc., a maker of
advertising inserts, filed bankruptcy for the third time since
2008, saying it plans to sell itself to  Quad/Graphics Inc. (QUAD)  as
part of a court-supervised auction.  Vertis and Quad have agreed to a deal in which Quad would
be the lead bidder at a proposed auction with an offer worth
$258.5 million, according to court papers filed in  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  in Wilmington,  Delaware , and a statement issued
by the companies.  The Quad offer “ensures continuity for clients and the
greatest number of opportunities for our employees while also
maximizing value for our stakeholders,” Vertis Chief Executive
Officer Gerald Sokol Jr. said in the statement.  Baltimore-based Vertis shed $700 million in debt as part of
its second bankruptcy in 2010.  Vertis’s biggest unsecured creditor is the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp. The size of the debt wasn’t listed in court
papers. The second-biggest unsecured creditor was Abitibi
Bowater, owed $19.4 million.  The company has arranged to borrow $150 million so it can
operate while seeking court approval for the auction and other
bankruptcy requirements.  Quad, based in Sussex, Wisconsin, is a maker of advertising
inserts for magazines and direct-mail marketing.  The case is In re Vertis Holdings Inc., 12-12821, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
