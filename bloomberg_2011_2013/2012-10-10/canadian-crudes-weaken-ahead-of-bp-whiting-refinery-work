Canadian crudes weakened before a
planned shutdown at  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting  refinery  in  Indiana  that
will reduce demand for Alberta oils.  The 420,000-barrel-a-day Whiting refinery plans to shut its
largest crude unit Nov. 1, a person familiar with operations at
the plant said April 19. The unit, known as Pipestill No. 12, is
scheduled to be shut for about 100 days, the person said at the
time. The unit will undergo modifications so that it can process
heavier oil as part of the plant’s $3.8 billion modernization
project, BP has said.  November Syncrude’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
narrowed $1.40 to $4.50 a barrel at 11:56 a.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread has narrowed
from $11 on Oct. 2.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI widened 35 cents to
$14.60 a barrel. Bakken oil’s premium narrowed $1.50 to 50
cents.  Prices also weakened on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Light
Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 20 cents to $20.60 over WTI,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg at 11:56 a.m. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet’s premium was unchanged at $20 a barrel.  Poseidon’s premium narrowed $1.15 to $13.10. Mars Blend
decreased by 65 cents to $13.85 a barrel over WTI, and Southern
Green Canyon lost $1 to $12.75.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
narrowed $1 to $17.40 above WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
