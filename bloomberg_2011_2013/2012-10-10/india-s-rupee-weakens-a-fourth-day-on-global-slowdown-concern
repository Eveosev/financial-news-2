India ’s rupee fell for a fourth day,
its longest losing streak since July, on concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis will deepen and further damp global growth.  Industrial output  in India rose 1 percent in August,
compared with an average 7.2 percent since 2006, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey before data due Oct.
12. India may lose its investment-grade rating within 24 months
if growth slows and political opposition to policy overhauls
increase, Standard & Poor’s said in a report received today. The
rupee gained 5.1 percent against the dollar last month as the
government announced measures to spur economic expansion.  “A significant part of the rupee turnaround has been
sentiment driven,” said  Indranil Pan , chief economist at  Kotak
Mahindra Bank Ltd. (KMB)  in Mumbai. “We caution against equating the
recent measures to a long-term panacea for weak fundamentals.”  The rupee declined 0.6 percent to 53.0600 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
53.1850 earlier, the weakest level since Sept. 27, and has
dropped 2.3 percent this week. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose 35
basis points, or 0.35 percentage point, to 11.50 percent.  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh began pushing pro-growth
measures in mid-September, ending two years of policy gridlock.
His administration has reduced energy subsidies, cut taxes on
overseas borrowing by companies and allowed more foreign
investment in industries including retailing and airlines.  The rupee was also pressured as the International Monetary
Fund cut India’s 2012 economic growth forecast yesterday to 4.9
percent from 6.1 percent, and warned today that European banks
may need to sell as much as $4.5 trillion in assets through 2013
if policy makers fall short of pledges to stem the region’s
fiscal crisis. That is 18 percent more than the Washington-based
lender estimated in April.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards were at 54.07 a dollar,
compared with 53.67 yesterday, and offshore non-deliverable
contracts were at 53.87 versus 53.50. Forwards are agreements to
buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.
