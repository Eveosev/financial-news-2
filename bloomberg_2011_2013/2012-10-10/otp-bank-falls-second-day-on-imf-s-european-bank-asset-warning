OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, fell for a second day as European stocks retreated after
the International Monetary Fund said the region’s banks may need
to sell assets.  The shares fell 0.2 percent to 4,070 forint by 11:18 a.m.
in Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock  index  was little changed at
18,866.21.  The IMF said European banks may need to sell as much as
$4.5 trillion in assets through 2013 if policy makers fall short
of pledges to stem the fiscal crisis. The projection is 18
percent higher than its April estimate. The IMF made the
comments in its Global Financial Stability Report released
today.  “Hardly inspiring news for Emerging  Europe  as it struggles
with the already weak European growth environment,” Timothy Ash, a London-based economist at Standard Bank Group Ltd., wrote
in e-mailed comments today. “Maybe this will inspire a fresh
round of concern over European bank deleveraging across the
region.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
