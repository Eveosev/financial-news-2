General Electric Co. and Verve
Energy, a state-owned utility based in Perth, started
 Australia ’s biggest solar farm to generate electricity for the
Southern Seawater Desalination Plant.  The 10-megawatt Greenough River project in Western
Australia uses panels from First Solar Inc. and will produce
energy equivalent to powering 3,000 homes, according to a joint
statement from  GE (GE) , Verve and First Solar. GE and Verve own 50
percent each of the plant.  The project partners are now evaluating the possibility of
expanding the plant’s capacity to as much as 40 megawatts to
meet increasing demand for renewable energy, Verve Chief
Executive Officer Jason Waters said in the statement.  The solar farm is 50 kilometers (31 miles) southeast of the
port town of Geraldton in  Western Australia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
