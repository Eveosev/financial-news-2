Radian Group Inc. (RDN) , the mortgage
insurer whose stock advanced 87 percent this year, said it now
expects to meet regulators’ capital standards for the rest of
2012 after recording investment gains.  The risk-to-capital ratio will probably be below the 25-to-
1 ceiling set by some state watchdogs for the remainder of the
year, the Philadelphia-based company said today in a statement.
The insurer said in August that it may fail to meet the standard
in the second half of this year.  Chief Executive Officer S.A. Ibrahim has purchased
reinsurance and benefited from investment gains as he seeks to
stay within state regulators’ capital rules. Rivals including
PMI Group Inc. and Triad Guaranty Inc. were forced to stop
selling new policies after falling short of the standards as
losses backing home loans drained capital.  Meeting the requirement is a result of “proactive capital
management initiatives,” the company said in its statement.  The insurer  advanced  5 cents to $4.42 in extended trading
at 5 p.m. in New York. Mortgage insurers cover losses when
homeowners default and foreclosures fail to recoup costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
