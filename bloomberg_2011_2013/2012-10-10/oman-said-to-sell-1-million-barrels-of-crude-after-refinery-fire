Oman’s Ministry of Oil and Gas sold
1 million barrels of the country’s crude after an Oct. 5 fire at
the Mina Al Fahal refinery shut operations, according to two
people with knowledge of the deal.  Mercuria Energy Trading SA bought the cargo, said one of
the people, who asked not to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak to the media. The shipment was sold near its
official selling price, or OSP, the other person said.  Oman’s OSP is $109.05 a barrel for October and $111.24 a
barrel for November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
