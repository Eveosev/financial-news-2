Russia’s domestic wheat price rose
at a slower rate in the past week after traders eased purchases
of the grain for export,  SovEcon  said.  Some international traders suspended purchases, SovEcon
said on its website yesterday. Russia did not offer wheat in
 Egypt ’s latest tender on Oct. 3, the Moscow-based researcher
said.  Russian milling wheat prices, which include the cost of
freight to Novorossiysk port, dropped to a range of 11,000
rubles ($353) to 11,200 rubles a ton last week from a range of
11,200 rubles to 11,400 rubles in the previous week, SovEcon
said.  Domestic prices for the exportable variety of milling wheat
rose by 125 rubles a ton to 9,750 rubles a ton last week,
SovEcon said. They advanced as much as 900 rubles a ton in the
week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
