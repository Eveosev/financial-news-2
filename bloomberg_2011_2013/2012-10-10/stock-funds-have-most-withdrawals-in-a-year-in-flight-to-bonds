Stock mutual funds in the U.S. had
the biggest withdrawals in more than a year as investors
continued their flight to the perceived safety of bonds.  Domestic stock funds had redemptions of $10.6 billion and
those buying non-U.S. equities lost $483 million to withdrawals
in the week ended Oct. 3, the most since Aug. 10. 2011,
according to the Washington-based  Investment Company Institute .
Investors added $10.87 billion to fixed-income funds in the
week, the ICI said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
