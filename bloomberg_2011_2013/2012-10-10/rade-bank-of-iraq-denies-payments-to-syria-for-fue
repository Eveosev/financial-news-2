Trade Bank of  Iraq  denied a report
it had received cash or letters of credit from  Syria  for fuel
supplies from Iraq, according to Chairwoman Hamdiyah Al-Jaff.  “The Trade Bank of Iraq has not conducted such
transaction(s),” she said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Financial Times reported yesterday that the Iraqi
government was sending fuel to Syria in monthly shipments
through the Trade Bank of Iraq. The shipments didn’t violate
U.S. and European Union sanctions, the newspaper said, citing
commercial documents.  Baghdad-based Trade Bank was formed in 2003 as an
independent state-owned lender with paid capital of $100 million
that has since increased to $850 million from retained profit,
according to the statement. “The bank is committed to operate
in accordance with international laws and regulations,” Trade
Bank said in the release.  To contact the reporters on this story:
