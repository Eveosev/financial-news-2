Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , fell to the lowest in almost two
months after the government said it supported the entry of the
fourth competitor into the telecommunications market.  The shares dropped 1 percent to 413 forint by the end of
trade in Budapest, the lowest close since Aug. 14. The benchmark
BUX stock index rose 0.4 percent.  The government said it encouraged the opening up of the
telecommunications industry even after a court last month voided
a tender that awarded a license to a group of state-owned
companies. Magyar Telekom and the two other incumbents, the
local units of Vodafone Plc and  Telenor ASA (TEL) , had appealed
against the bidding result.  The government considers it “unacceptable” that consumers
have to pay “very high” prices indicating a lack of
competition, according to an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
