Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest
crude exporter, reduced oil production and supplies to the
market in September, according to the Gulf Oil Review.  The kingdom trimmed its daily crude output to 9.724 million
barrels from 9.753 million in August, data from Gulf Oil Review,
a report published by Winchester, U.K.-based Petroleum Policy
Intelligence founded by Bill Farren-Price, released today show.
Supplies to the market dropped to 9.777 million barrels from
9.835 million.  In contrast, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said that the kingdom increased supply to 9.85 million
barrels a day last month, from 9.81 million in August, according
to its secretariat’s Monthly Oil Market Report published today,
citing secondary sources. Saudi Arabia estimated its output at
9.72 million in direct communication with OPEC.  Saudi Arabia raised its production above 10 million barrels
a day this year, the highest in at least three decades, as it
sought to lower prices. Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  told reporters
in Riyadh yesterday that  Brent crude  is “still high” and the
kingdom along with other Persian Gulf Arab producers will “work
toward moderating the price.” Brent traded at $114.39 a barrel
as of 1:32 p.m. London time on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
