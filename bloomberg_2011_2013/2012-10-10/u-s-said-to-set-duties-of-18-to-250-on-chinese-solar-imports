  The U.S. Commerce Department set
final duties ranging from 18.32 percent to 249.96 percent on
imports of solar-energy products from  China , after determining
that the goods were sold in the U.S. below cost, according to a
person familiar with the decision.  The agency set separate duties of 14.78 percent to 15.97
percent to counter Chinese subsidies for the merchandise, the
person said in an e-mail today. The Commerce Department is
scheduled to announce the decision later today. The amount of
duties imposed varies by company according to Commerce
Department determination of damages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
