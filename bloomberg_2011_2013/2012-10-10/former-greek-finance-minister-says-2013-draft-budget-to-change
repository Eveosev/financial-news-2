Greece ’s 2013 budget draft will
change significantly because talks with international creditors
have yet to conclude, Pasok lawmaker and former Finance Minister
Filippos Sachinidis said.  “Today we discuss a budget draft for 2013 which was tabled
in order to meet a constitutional provision,”  Sachinidis said
today in  Athens  at the first parliamentary debate of the bill.
“It’s clear that the fiscal adjustment in 2013 will be much
more front-loaded compared to the draft.”  Key issues such as debt sustainability, the size of the
fiscal adjustment needed through 2016, and especially in 2013
and 2014, and how to cover Greece’s financing gap aren’t
included in the draft, Sachinidis said.  Greece’s government is in talks with international
inspectors on how to carve out a 13.5 billion-euro ($13.5
billion) package of of new budget cuts required for continued
aid under two bailouts totaling 240 billion euros. Agreement on
the measures is imperative to allow the release of 31 billion
euros of bailout funds designed mainly to recapitalize the
nation’s banks in a cash-starved economy.  “We don’t have the luxury to delay,” said Sachinidis, who
served as finance minister from March 2012 until elections in
May. “Every day that goes by without the tranche being
disbursed businesses are closing and jobs are being lost.”  Greece’s unemployment rate has risen to almost 25 percent
and the economy will contract for a fifth year under the weight
of austerity. Greece got its first European Union and
International Monetary Fund bailout in May 2010.  Delays by  Europe  and Greece in taking action earlier are to
blame for the Mediterranean country’s deepening crisis, he said.
Action must be taken at this critical juncture for Europe as
“it’s not just the southern countries but the eurozone itself
which is put at risk by the systemic dangers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
