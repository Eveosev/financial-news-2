The outlook for the Serbian dinar is
improving and the currency is likely to continue appreciating
against the euro,  Societe Generale  said.  “The coalition government has been delivering a tough
policy message since being sworn-in in July, which has been well
received,” SocGen analyst Guillaume Salomon wrote in a note to
clients today, issuing a “sell” recommendation at 114.00
dinars to the euro. Salomon set a target of 108.00 to the euro
and a stop-loss level of 117.20.  The currency traded at 113.9854 at 4:59 p.m. in Belgrade,
rising above 114 for the first time since mid-May, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Central bank Vice-Governor Veselin Pjescic said today the
dinar has stabilized since June because of increases in  interest
rates , changes to reserve requirement rules to drain dinar
liquidity and renewed lending subsidies for liquidity-stricken
companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
