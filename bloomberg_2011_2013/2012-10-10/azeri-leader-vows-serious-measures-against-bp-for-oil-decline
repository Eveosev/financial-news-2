President  Ilham Aliyev  blamed  BP Plc (BP/) 
for the decline in Azerbaijan’s oil production and vowed to take
“serious measures” against the U.K. producer.  In comments broadcast today on state TV channel AzTV,
Aliyev said the “unexpected decline” in oil output was because
of “grave mistakes’ by BP, which operates the Azeri-Chirag-
Guneshli, or ACG, and Shah Deniz fields.  Aliyev also accused BP of failing to deliver on a promise
nearly a month ago to keep output at a stable level.  ‘‘It’s totally unacceptable,” Aliyev said. “The State Oil
Co. of Azerbaijan has been instructed to officially raise this
issue and take the necessary measures. Serious measures are
needed and will be taken.”  ACG output plunged 12 percent in the first half of 2012
from a year earlier, according to data on BP’s website. The
field produced 35.4 million metric tons of oil last year, or 78
percent of  Azerbaijan ’s total output.  The U.K. energy producer, which holds 35.8 percent of the
project, gave no reason for the decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
