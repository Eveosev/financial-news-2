Swedish industrial production
rebounded in August as the largest Nordic economy showed
resilience to slumping demand from  Europe .  Industrial production  rose an annual 3.2 percent, after
contracting a revised 0.9 percent the previous month, Stockholm-
based Statistics  Sweden  said today. It was  estimated  to rise 1.5
percent, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
of five economists. Output rose a  monthly  0.4 percent, compared
with a 0.9 percent predicted contraction.  Swedenâ€™s central bank last month cut its benchmark rate for
a third time since December to boost economic growth. Sweden
gets about half its output from exports, about 70 percent of
which go to Europe where countries are cutting spending.  Industrial orders from Swedish companies fell an  annual  6.5
percent and decreased a  monthly  1.4 percent in August,
 Statistics Sweden  said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
