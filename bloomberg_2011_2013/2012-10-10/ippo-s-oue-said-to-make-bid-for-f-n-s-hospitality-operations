Fraser & Neave Ltd. received an
offer for its hospitality and serviced residence business from a
property affiliate of Lippo Group, said two people with
knowledge of the matter.   F&N today said it received a S$1.4 billion ($1.1 billion)
unsolicited offer for the operations, without naming the bidder.
 Overseas Union Enterprise Ltd. (OUE)  made the offer, the people said,
asking not to be identified because the information is private.  Teresa Woo, the head of investor relations at Overseas
Union, declined to comment.    To contact the reporter on this story:
