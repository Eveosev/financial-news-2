India’s automakers’ association
lowered its full-year domestic car sales forecast for the second
time in four months as  slowing economic growth  and high  interest
rates  keep buyers from showrooms.  The  Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers  cut its car
sales growth forecast to as low as 1 percent, S. Sandilya, the
president of the industry group, said in  New Delhi  today. Car
sales increased 0.2 percent in the year ended March 2009,
according to the group. The annual forecast for growth in local
car sales was cut to as low as 9 percent in July, from an
earlier estimate of 10 percent-12 percent pace given in April.  The forecast underscores the challenge carmakers from
 Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269)  to  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  will face to win
customers in Asia’s third-biggest auto market. New models and
variants are being introduced and discounts offered as
automakers seek to spur sales in the festive season under way as
 high gasoline prices  and borrowing costs discourage buyers.  “Inflation is not under control and the cost of vehicle
ownership is high,” said Sandilya. “Economic growth is also
not encouraging.”  Shares of  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  declined as much as 1.1
percent and traded at 1,384.10 rupees, or down 0.6 percent, as
of 11:45 a.m. in Mumbai.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM)  declined 1.4
percent to 857.25 rupees.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  fell 0.1 percent to
269.40 rupees. The benchmark Sensitive Index fell 0.7 percent.  September Sales  Local deliveries in September fell 5.4 percent to 157,536
cars, the second consecutive monthly decline, the group said.  The slowdown in India comes as the European debt crisis
dragged the region’s auto market to its lowest level in 17
years. China’s state-backed auto association will release
monthly sales data today.  Domestic sales of Maruti, the local unit of Suzuki, was
unchanged in the six months ended Sept. 30 from a year earlier.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  said on Oct. 1 its Indian sales last
month fell 14 percent to 30,851 vehicles. Tata Motors, maker of
the world’s cheapest car, the Nano, reported an 18 percent drop
in passenger-vehicle sales for September, while Toyota’s India
sales declined 5.4 percent.  Car demand has been hurt by  high gasoline prices  and
borrowing costs in a country where almost 80 percent of auto
purchases are funded through loans.  The International Monetary Fund yesterday cut its 2012
expansion forecast for Asia’s third-largest economy to 4.9
percent, the slowest pace in a decade, from 6.1 percent in July.  India’s central bank raised interest rates a record 13
times from March 2010 to October last year to rein in inflation.
Headline inflation accelerated to 7.55 percent in August, the
fastest pace in the BRIC group of largest emerging nations that
also includes Brazil, Russia and  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
