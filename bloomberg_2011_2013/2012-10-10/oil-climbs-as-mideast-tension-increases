Oil fell on expectations that U.S.
supplies will rise for the first time in three weeks and concern
that a weaker economy will curb demand for commodities.  Prices dropped 1.2 percent. Stockpiles probably gained  1.5
million barrels  last week, a Bloomberg survey showed before a
government report tomorrow. Oil slipped with equities as  Alcoa
Inc. (AA)  cut its aluminum-consumption forecast on waning Chinese
growth. Brent oil was little changed on Mideast tension, and its
premium to New York futures reached the most in almost a year.  “Looks like the inventory report will be bearish,” said
Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research
in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “Global economic growth is
slowing. The fundamentals are overtaking the geopolitical
threats.”  Oil for November delivery decreased $1.14 to settle at
$91.25 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
contract increased $3.06 yesterday to $92.39, the highest
settlement since Oct. 1. Prices are down 7.7 percent this year.  Prices were little changed after the industry-funded
American Petroleum Institute reported oil inventories gained
1.65 million barrels last week to 364.6 million. Oil fell 96
cents, or 1 percent, to $91.43 a barrel at 4:39 p.m. in
electronic trading. It was at $91.41 before the report was
released at 4:30 p.m.  Brent for November settlement slid 17 cents to $114.33 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The European benchmark’s premium to New York-traded West
Texas Intermediate oil widened to $23.08, the most since Oct.
20, 2011.  U.S. Supply  Crude inventories grew to 366.2 million in the seven days
ended Oct. 5, according to the median of 11 analyst estimates in
the Bloomberg survey. Output rose 11,000 barrels a day to 6.52
million in the week ended Sept. 28, the most since December
1996, the Energy Department reported Oct. 3.  The weekly report will be released at 11 a.m. tomorrow in
 Washington . It’s being delayed a day because of the Columbus Day
holiday on Oct. 8.  “We still have abundant supply in the U.S. and demand is
still pretty weak,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at
the Price Futures Group in Chicago.  The Energy Department lowered its 2012 estimate for
gasoline  consumption  to 8.72 million barrels a day from 8.73
million last month, the department’s Energy Information
Administration said today in its monthly  Short-Term Energy
Outlook . It was 8.75 million in 2011.  The department cut the 2012 oil-price projection to $95.55
a barrel from $95.66 in September. Futures have averaged $95.96
so far this year.  Chinese Slowdown  The U.S. and  China  are the world’s biggest oil-consuming
countries, together accounting for 32 percent of global demand
in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World
Energy.  The economic slowdown in China spurred Alcoa, the largest
U.S. aluminum producer, to cut its 2012 outlook for global
demand for the metal. Consumption will rise 6 percent this year,
compared with the 7 percent projected in July, the company said
yesterday. The World Bank forecast Oct. 8 that the easing growth
rate in China would curb a 2012 expansion in Asian countries,
excluding Japan and  India , to the lowest level in 11 years.  U.S. stocks retreated for a fourth day as Alcoa shares
slumped. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell as much as 0.8
percent, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1 percent.  “Oil is following the equities,” said Rich Ilczyszyn,
chief market strategist and founder of Iitrader.com in  Chicago .  Mideast Tension  Oil rallied as much as 1.4 percent earlier as Defense
Secretary Leon Panetta said the U.S. has sent military advisers
to Jordan and offered Turkey assistance to help prepare for
humanitarian aid and possible military spillover from the war in
neighboring  Syria . He spoke after NATO defense ministers
concluded a two-day meeting in Brussels.  “The tension could easily spill over from one country to
the next,” said Jacob Correll, a Louisville, Kentucky-based
analyst at Summit Energy Inc., which manages more than $20
billion in companies’ annual energy spending. “That’s the
reason that any type of tension there will keep the market on
the edge.”  Necdet Ozel, chief of the Turkish general staff, said
continued Syrian shelling would provoke a tougher response
following six days of retaliatory barrages by his forces against
President Bashar al-Assad’s army. The comments were broadcast by
CNN-Turk television.  The Turkish retaliation followed the deaths of five people
from a Syrian artillery shell that hit the border town of
Akcakale Oct. 3. Ozel inspected troops today in Akcakale as well
as another border town, Suruc in Sanliurfa province.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 585,054
contracts as of 5:05 p.m. Volume totaled 764,375 contracts
yesterday, 46 percent above the three-month average and the
highest level since Sept. 19. Open interest was 1.54 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
