percent to 1,616.36.  BASE METALS  Aluminum tumbled the most in 11 weeks as Alcoa Inc. cut its
forecast for global demand this year, and car sales unexpectedly
fell in  China , the world’s top metal consumer.  Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, reduced its
projection by 1 percentage point. The China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers said that wholesale deliveries were
1.32 million units last month, below the 1.35 million estimated

touched $3.6935, the lowest for a most-active contract since

for the first time in three weeks, and concern mounted that a
sluggish global economy will curb demand for commodities.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil futures for
November delivery dropped 1.2 percent to $91.25 a barrel.  Brent for November settlement slid 0.1 percent to $114.33 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.  BP Plc bought a third North Sea Forties cargo for October

Urals crude in northwest Europe at a smaller discount to Dated
Brent.  Two Forties shipments for export in October were deferred
for a second time, according to two people with knowledge of the
loading program.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Soybean fell, capping the longest slump in three weeks, on
speculation that rain boosted prospects for crops in the U.S.
and South America.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybean futures for November
delivery dropped 1.7 percent to $15.2325 a bushel. The price
dropped for the third straight day, the longest slump since

exports.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 0.7 percent to
$7.3675 a bushel. Earlier, the price touched $7.3225, the lowest
since Sept. 28.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cocoa futures fell the most in a week on speculation that
Europe’s economic woes will damp demand.  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, cocoa for December

Aug. 3.  Cattle futures for December delivery dropped 0.1 percent to
$1.26575 a pound.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement were
unchanged at $1.467 a pound.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil rose to a three-week high on speculation that
supplies fell last week, and higher prices for gasoil in Europe
may spur more exports of diesel from the U.S.  On the Nymex, heating-oil futures for November delivery
gained 0.3 percent to $3.2131 a gallon. Earlier, the price
reached $3.2424, the highest since Sept. 17.  Gasoline futures for November delivery advanced less than
0.1 percent to $2.9593 a gallon.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas gained for the third straight day amid

glut of the fuel in storage.  On the Nymex, gas futures for November delivery rose 0.2
percent to at $3.475 per million British thermal units.  U.K. gas for next-day delivery rose to the highest since
February as imports from  Norway  slumped to the lowest in a month
and cooler weather stoked demand.  The price climbed 1 percent to 64.65 pence a therm at 3:30
p.m. London time after earlier reaching 65.5 pence. Next-month
gas added 0.2 percent to 64 pence a therm. That’s equivalent to
$10.26 per million Btu.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold gained for the first time in four sessions as the
dollar fell against the euro, increasing demand for the metal as
an alternative investment.  On the Comex, gold futures for December delivery rose 10
