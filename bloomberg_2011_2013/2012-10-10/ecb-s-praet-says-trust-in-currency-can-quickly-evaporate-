European Central Bank Executive
Board member Peter Praet said a currency can’t function without
trust.  “We have to draw the lessons of history,” he said today
in a speech in  Frankfurt . “Trust in a currency can quickly
evaporate.”  In a crisis situation a central bank mandated to ensure
 price stability  has to “promptly and decisively resist the
shortage of liquidity,” he said. “An expanded central bank
liquidity buffer is non-inflationary under these conditions.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
