Following is a translation of the
statement by  Brazil ’s central bank on its interest rate decision
today.  “The Copom decided to reduce the Selic rate to 7.25
percent p.a., without a bias, by five votes in favor and 3 votes
for keeping the Selic rate at 7.50 percent p.a.  Considering the balance of risks for inflation, the
recovery of domestic activity and the complexity surrounding the
global environment, the committee understands that the stability
of monetary conditions for a sufficiently prolonged period of
time is the most adequate strategy to guarantee the convergence
of inflation to target, even if not in a linear fashion.  Voting in favor of the reduction in the Selic rate to 7.25
percent p.a. are the following board members: President
Alexandre Antonio Tombini, Aldo Luiz Mendes,  Altamir Lopes ,
Luiz Awazu Pereira da Silva and Luiz Edson Feltrim.  Voting for keeping the Selic rate at 7.50 percent p.a. are
the following board members: Anthero de Moraes Meirelles, Carlos
Hamilton Vasconcelos Araujo and Sidnei Correa Marques.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
