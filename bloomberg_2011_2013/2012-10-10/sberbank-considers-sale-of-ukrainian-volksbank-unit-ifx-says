OAO Sberbank may sell its Ukrainian
unit Volksbank International,  Interfax-Ukraine  reported, citing
Ihor Yushko, the chief executive officer at Sberbank’s Ukrainian
subsidiary.  Sberbank has already got some offers, which “did not
satisfy,” Yushko said, according to the news agency. The
decision on whether to sell Volksbank or incorporate it into
Sberbank’s Ukrainian subsidiary will be made by the end of the
month, Interfax quoted Yushko as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
