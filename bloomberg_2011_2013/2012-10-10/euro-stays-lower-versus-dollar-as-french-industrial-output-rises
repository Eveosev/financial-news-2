The euro stayed lower against the
dollar and yen as a report showed French industrial production
climbed in August.  The 17-member currency weakened 0.2 percent to $1.2862 at
7:51 a.m. London time, after earlier touching $1.2835, the
lowest since Oct. 1. It also declined 0.2 percent to 100.64 yen.
The yen was little changed at 78.24 per dollar.  French industrial output rose 1.5 percent from a month
earlier. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a
0.3 percent drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
