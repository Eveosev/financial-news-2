President Joachim Gauck will today
become the first German leader to visit the Czech village of
Lidice, which was razed by the Nazis in 1942 following the
assassination of occupation leader Reinhard Heydrich.  Gauck came to pay respects to Nazi victims of an event that
is a reminder of a very “bloody” and “monstrous” past, he
told a news conference aired on Czech state TV today.  The destruction of Lidice, near  Prague , started on June 10,
1942, when its 173 male residents were executed and women and
children were sent for re-education in German families or killed
in concentration camps, according to the Lidice memorial
website. In the Czech Republic, the village became a symbol of
atrocities committed by Nazis during World War II.  Gauck and his Czech counterpart Vaclav Klaus wouldn’t
discuss the expulsion of Sudeten Germans from the former
 Czechoslovakia  after the war, when asked by journalist during
the news conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
