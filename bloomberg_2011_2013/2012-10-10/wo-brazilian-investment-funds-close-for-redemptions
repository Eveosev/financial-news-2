Two  Brazil  investment funds closed
for redemptions and new investments because of lack of liquidity
to pay investors.  BRL Trust Distribuidora de Titulos e Valores Mobiliarios
SA , the funds’ administrator and manager, said it identified
“inconsistencies” in documents and registrations of the
holdings, BRL Trust said in two regulatory filings yesterday.  The two funds, Fundo de Investimento Multimercado Credito
Privado Salus and Fundo de Investimento Multimercado Credito
Privado Providentia, will ask shareholders what to do with
existing assets, according to the documents.  Providentia had 79.7 million reais ($39 million) in net
assets on Sept. 8 and three shareholders, and Salus had 80.7
million reais and 42 investors, according to data from Brazil’s
securities regulator, CVM.  An official at BRL Trust, who asked not to be identified in
accordance with internal policy, declined to comment further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
