Germany  will save 570 billion euros
($736 billion) by 2050 if it sticks to its plan to replace
atomic reactors and fossil sources with renewable sources of
energy, a group of researchers said.  “The investments made now, at the beginning, will pay off
within a foreseeable time frame and have a positive economic
impact,” the  Renewable Energy Research Association , a group of
clean-energy research institutes, said today on its website.  The statement comes as Germany debates how to overhaul its
clean-energy subsidy system, which has helped raise the share of
renewables to 25 percent of the power mix, to contain rising
costs. The fee consumers are paying via their electricity bills
to fund renewables is expected to climb by about 50 percent next
year after solar-panel installations exceeded forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
