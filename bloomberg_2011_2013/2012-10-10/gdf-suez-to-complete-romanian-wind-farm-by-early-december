GDF Suez SA (GSZ)  will complete the
construction of a 75 million-euro ($96 million) wind farm in
 Romania  at the end of November or early December, said Eric Stab, who heads GDF Suez Energy Romania.  The French natural-gas distributor will conclude building
its 48-megawatt wind farm and is considering investing into
other wind projects in the eastern European country, Stab said
today in an interview in Bucharest.  “This investment is on track,” Stab said. “We do have
different wind projects at different stages of maturity and I
hope we can move ahead with other projects in the not-too-
distant future.”  Romania is attracting energy investors, including  CEZ AS (CEZ) 
and  Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW) , with its wind investment-incentive
program and the location in the southern Black Sea region of
Dobrogea, where the average wind speed is about 25.2 kilometers
per hour (15.7 miles per hour).  To contact the reporter on this story:
