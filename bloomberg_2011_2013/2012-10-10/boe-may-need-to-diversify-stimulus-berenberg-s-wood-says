The  Bank of England  may need to
consider diversifying its asset purchase program as an
intensifying fiscal squeeze next year forces it to expand
stimulus, a former central bank official said.  “2013 is going to be a pretty tough year,” Rob Wood, the
newly appointed chief U.K. economist at Berenberg Bank who
previously led analysis of British data for the central bank,
told reporters at a briefing in London today. “The Bank of
England will do more QE to help things.”  Bank of England Governor Mervyn King yesterday said the
 economy  faces a slow and gradual recovery, and suggested asset
purchases were the bank’s primary tool to help spur growth. He
has rejected calls to diversify the type of assets purchased as
part of so-called quantitative easing. By the end of this month,
the central bank will have bought 375 billion pounds ($601
billion) of gilts.  “The drawback of QE as it’s currently implemented is that
it’s hard for it to reach consumers,” Wood said. “If you’ve
tried something with 375 billion quid and it’s not quite doing
the trick, then maybe it’s better to try it with a few other
things as well.”  Wood said that an easing of the  euro area  crisis will help
the U.K. economy recover after another “year or two.” While
the government shouldn’t implement any additional fiscal cuts in
the near term, more austerity will be needed in future to
eliminate Britain’s structural deficit, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
