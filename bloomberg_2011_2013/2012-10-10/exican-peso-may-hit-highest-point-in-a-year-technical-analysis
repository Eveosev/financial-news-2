The Mexican peso may strengthen to
its highest level versus the U.S. dollar in over a year
following a corrective phase, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
citing oversold and diverging momentum measures.  The peso may depreciate to the 12.91-to-12.95 per dollar
range before falling to 13 in the short term, Niall O’Connor, a
New York-based technical analyst at JPMorgan, wrote today in a
note to clients. The currency may bounce off this so-called
ceiling and reverse back to 12.55 per dollar, its highest level
since Sept. 9, 2011, he said. The peso rose to 12.6635 last
week, a level it hadn’t reached since March.  “The decline in the dollar last week against the peso may
have been overdone short term,” O’Connor said in a telephone
interview. “We’re in a temporary recovery phase. It looks like
it will correct up, but the bottom line is that the medium-term
trend is still lower.”  The Mexican currency fell 0.2 percent to 12.8962 per dollar
at 11:44 a.m. in New York after declining as much as 0.8 percent
yesterday, its biggest drop since Sept. 17.  The currency leads all 16 of the dollar’s biggest peers
with a gain of 8.1 percent this year.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
