France , Germany and Spain called for
stable funding for the European Union’s Common Agricultural
Policy, as the bloc negotiates the future of a system that
accounted for more than two-fifths of its budget in 2011.  France’s Agriculture Minister Stephane Le Foll met with his
German counterpart Ilse Aigner in Berlin yesterday and with
Spain’s Miguel Arias Canete in Paris today, according to
separate statements from the French and Spanish farm ministries.
The ministers backed a European Commission proposal to maintain
the farm budget at the level of 2013 for the period through
2020, according to the statements.  The EU’s budget for agriculture and rural development was
58 billion euros ($75 billion) in 2011, according to commission
spokesman  Roger Waite . The policy accounted for 44 percent of
total EU spending last year,  data  from the bloc shows.  Le Foll, Aigner and Arias Canete “underline the importance
of the CAP for growth, employment, the environment and
innovation in  Europe ’s rural areas, as well as Europe’s
contribution to global food balances,” the ministries wrote.  The three ministers underlined that they want to keep
planting rights for vines and prolong the EU’s system of sugar
quotas until 2020, according to the French and Spanish
statements.  Le Foll and Aigner agreed to “a certain rapprochement” of
the level of direct agricultural aid in EU countries, on the
condition aid adjustments are “reasonable and progressive,”
according to the French statement.  The French and Spanish ministers agreed that the EU
proposal to keep agricultural aid unchanged is “an absolute
minimum,”  Spain ’s ministry wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
