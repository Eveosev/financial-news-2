The Vietnamese government allocated
land for a joint Kuwaiti project to build a refinery and
petrochemicals plant, KUNA news agency reported, citing Kuwait
Petroleum Corp. magazine.  The land is now ready for excavation and basic
construction, KUNA said. State-run KPC and the Japanese refiner
Idemitsu Kosan Co. each has 35.1 percent stake in the Nghi Son
refinery, while state-controlled Vietnam Oil & Gas Group holds
25.1 percent and  Mitsui Chemicals Inc. (4183)  holds the rest. The
refinery is forecast to process 200,000 barrels per day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
