Skype Technologies SA co-founder
Niklas Zennstromâ€™s investment firm is raising a 300 million euro
($386 million) fund to back global technology companies,
according to three people familiar with the situation.  Atomico Ventures III LP has gathered about 250 million
euros, surpassing the $165 million the prior fund raised in
2010, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified
because the information is private. European Investment Fund,
based in Luxembourg, is a limited partner, according to its
website.  Olivia Doherty, a spokeswoman for London-based Atomico,
declined to comment.  Zennstrom, who founded the venture capital firm in 2006,
searches for young companies trying to take advantage of the
increasing popularity of smartphones and Internet shopping.
Atomico was part of a consortium that sold Skype, which
Zennstrom co-founded with Janus Friis in 2003, to Microsoft
Corp. last year for $8.5 billion in cash.  The firm also has invested in Klarna, a Swedish provider of
e-commerce payment systems; Rovio Entertainment Oy, the Finnish
maker of the Angry Birds mobile game; and Internet sales site
Fab.com.  Atomico has made more than 50 investments globally,
according to its website. It has offices in  Sao Paulo , Beijing,
Istanbul and  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
