The euro weakened for a fourth day
against the yen after Standard & Poor’s yesterday cut Spain’s
sovereign-debt rating to one level above junk.  The 17-member currency weakened against 13 of its 16 major
counterparts before Italy sells bonds today amid concern
Europe’s debt crisis is deepening. The  Dollar Index (DXY)  touched a
one-month high as demand for the greenback as a haven rose.
 Australia ’s dollar strengthened after data showed the nation
added the most workers since May. The yen rose versus the
majority of its peers as Asian stocks declined.  “I can see further weakness to the euro from here,” said
 Imre Speizer , a strategist in Auckland at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) ,
Australia’s second-largest lender. “If the fiscal outlook is
much worse in Spain, it could fall to junk status. In the short
term, it looks like the dollar is going higher,”  The euro declined 0.2 percent to 100.50 yen at 9:33 a.m.
London time. It was little changed at $1.2879, after weakening
as much as 0.4 percent to $1.2826, the lowest since Oct. 1. The
Japanese currency gained 0.2 percent to 78.04 per dollar after
reaching 77.95, the strongest level since Oct. 1.  Dollar Index  The Dollar Index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trade partners, gained 0.1 percent to 79.971, after climbing to
as high as 80.205, the most since Sept. 11.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares slid 0.1 percent,
extending declines to a fourth day.  S&P lowered Spain’s rating by two levels to BBB- from BBB+
and assigned a negative outlook for its debt. The country’s
deepening recession is limiting the government’s policy options,
the New York-based ratings company said in a statement.  Moody’s Investors Service on Aug. 30 said Spain’s credit
rating remains on review for a possible downgrade from Baa3, the
company’s lowest investment grade.  Spain’s 10-year  bond yields  have fallen from the euro-era
record of 7.75 percent reached in July to as low as 5.55 percent
since European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the ECB
is ready to do “whatever it takes” to preserve the euro. While
the central bank unveiled an unlimited debt-purchase program on
Sept. 6 to contain a surge in government borrowing costs,
Spain’s Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  has held off on a decision
about whether to request ECB and European Union aid.  Spain’s 10-year yield rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 5.88 percent.  Moody’s Action  “Because of S&P’s downgrade, people can’t help thinking
about Moody’s next action,” said Daisuke Karakama, a market
economist in  Tokyo  at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd., a unit of
Japan’s third-largest banking group by market value. “Rating
actions will be another catalyst for Spain to seek rescue.”  Italy will sell as much as six billion euros of  government
securities  maturing in 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2025 today.  The euro appreciated 1.7 percent in the past three months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that tracked
10 developed-nation currencies. The dollar fell 3.7 percent, and
the yen lost 1.3 percent. EU leaders will hold a two-day  summit 
in Brussels starting Oct. 18.  ‘Some Progress’  “We may see some progress in Spain’s request for rescue
toward the European Union summit next week,” said Ken Takahashi, assistant vice president of global markets in New
York at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd. “The downside risk to
the euro is limited until that time.”  In Australia, the statistics bureau said today the number
of people  employed  climbed 14,500 in September, almost three
times the median estimate from economists surveyed by  Bloomberg
News . The jobless rate rose to 5.4 percent, the highest since
April 2010, from 5.1 percent the prior month.  “The rise in the  unemployment rate  comes down to a rising
participation rate,”  Todd Elmer , head of Group-of-10 foreign-
exchange strategy for  Asia  excluding Japan at Citigroup Inc. in
 Singapore , wrote in a report today. “Australia’s dollar may
gain further” as the market digests the details of the report.  Australia’s dollar climbed 0.4 percent to $1.0271 and
touched $1.0287, the strongest since Oct. 2.  The  Bank of Korea  today cut borrowing costs for the second
time this year, lowering the benchmark rate to 2.75 percent from
3 percent. The won was little changed at 1,114.35 per dollar.  The Dollar Index may test its resistance area that includes
the 200-day moving average and the 38.2 percent retracement from
the July 24 high of 84.1 to the Sept. 14 low of 78.601,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The “short-term corrective
phase” continues to develop after the September low, Niall O’Connor, a New York-based technical analyst at JPMorgan, wrote
in a research note yesterday.  The 200-day moving average was at 80.719 today, while the
38.2 percent retracement stood at 80.702, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Resistance refers to an area on a chart where
orders to sell may be clustered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
