Fraser & Neave Ltd. plans to say
that Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi’s $7.3 billion
takeover offer isn’t compelling and undervalues some of its
assets, said people with knowledge of the matter.  F&N’s board is likely to say tomorrow the S$8.88 ($7.21) a
share bid is fair, based on recommendations from adviser
JPMorgan Chase & Co., said the people, who asked not to be named
because the matter is private. Still, F&N is likely to add that
the bid undervalues its properties and its brewing assets in
Myanmar, according to three of the people.  Charoen, through  Thai Beverage Pcl (THBEV)  and TCC Assets Ltd., in
September offered S$9 billion for the 70 percent of Singapore-
based F&N he didn’t already own. F&N  shareholders  last month
agreed to sell the company’s 40 percent stake in Tiger beer
maker  Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd. (APB)  for S$5.6 billion to  Heineken
NV. (HEIA)   Jennifer Yu, a spokeswoman for F&N, declined to comment. A
JPMorgan official declined to comment on the firm’s
recommendation.  TCC Assets owns or has commitments for 33.5 percent of
F&N’s shares, according to an statement to Singapore’s stock
exchange today.  On Oct. 8, F&N said it recorded a “revaluation surplus”
of about S$498 million on some of its properties, including The
Centrepoint shopping mall on  Singapore ’s Orchard Road. The
company is still reviewing the value of real estate under
development and its property management business, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
