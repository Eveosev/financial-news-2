Seven-time NBA All Star Tracy McGrady will play for Chinese Basketball Association team
Qingdao DoubleStar Eagles, Yahoo! Inc.’s sports website reported
today, citing an unidentified person.  McGrady, 33, signed a one-year contract yesterday with the
team based on China’s east coast, Yahoo! Sports said, without
giving financial details.  McGrady couldn’t secure a guaranteed NBA contract for this
season and decided against trying to make a roster in training
camp, the report said, adding that his partnership with  Yao Ming 
at the  Houston Rockets  from 2004 to 2010 made him popular in
China. He most recently played for the  Atlanta Hawks .  The Chinese season ends in March, allowing McGrady to
return to the United States and possibly sign with an NBA
playoff contender, the report said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
