Bumi Plc, the London-traded
Indonesian coal venture founded by  Nathaniel Rothschild , rose to
the highest in more than two weeks before a board meeting
scheduled for tomorrow.  The stock advanced 12 percent to 185.70 pence by the close
in  London , the highest price since Sept. 21. That was the last
day of trading before Bumi said it was starting an urgent probe
into “potential financial and other irregularities” at its
Indonesian operations, especially 29 percent-owned  PT Bumi
Resources. (BUMI)   Bumi Plc has hired a London lawfirm to investigate a $637
million writedown of development funds and exploration assets.
Liberum Capital Ltd. analysts wrote this week that the only two
acceptable outcomes for investors in the London company will be
Bumi Plc gaining a controlling stake in Jakarta-based Bumi
Resources, or a sale or swap agreement that separates  Bumi Plc (BUMI) 
from the Indonesian company.  The board meeting has been planned for a year, Kenneth Allan, marketing director at PT Borneo Lumbung Energi & Metal,
which holds a 23.8 percent stake in Bumi Plc, said Oct. 8. “Our
people are going up there,” Allan said, adding he hasn’t seen a
meeting agenda and isn’t a board member of Bumi Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
