The U.S. Treasury Department said
today that it has expanded sanctions against  Mexico ’s Sinaloa
drug cartel and its reputed leader, Juan Jose Esparragoza
Moreno, known as “El Azul.”  The Treasury forbade Americans to conduct business with two
companies linked to Esparragoza Moreno and also froze any assets
the companies may have under U.S. jurisdiction.  One of the firms, Urbanizadora Nueva Italia SA,
is a real estate company that sells homes in a community near
Guadalajara controlled by Esparragoza Moreno. The other is an
event-planning company, Socialika Rentas y Catering SA, owned by
his daughter.  “Today’s action serves as a reminder to Esparragoza Moreno
that he and his organization remain in our sights,” Adam J. Szubin, Director of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control,
said in a statement in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
