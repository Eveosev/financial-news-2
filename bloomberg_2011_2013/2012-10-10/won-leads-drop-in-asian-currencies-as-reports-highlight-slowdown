India ’s rupee and South Korea’s won
led losses in Asian currencies after reports this week added to
concern the global economic slowdown is deepening, damping the
region’s export outlook.  The International Monetary Fund yesterday cut its global
growth forecast to the least since the 2009, and warned today
that Europe’s debt crisis could worsen. Philippine overseas
sales unexpectedly fell in August, official data showed today.
Industrial production in Malaysia dropped in August for the
first time in a year and the  Bank of Korea  will cut its
benchmark  interest rate  tomorrow, according to Bloomberg
surveys.  “Sentiment for the regional currencies will remain weak
for now due to global growth concerns highlighted by the IMF,”
said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan Center for
 Economic Research  in Tokyo. “Asian nations like Thailand and
Malaysia that depend on exports will see a bigger negative
impact from the slowdown in external demand.”  The rupee slid 0.4 percent to 52.94 per dollar as of 2:05
p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The won
weakened 0.4 percent to 1,114.70 and Thailand’s baht and the
Philippine peso each declined 0.2 percent to 30.71 and 41.557,
respectively. Malaysia’s ringgit lost 0.1 percent to 3.0757.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s most-active currencies, fell for a second day. Its 60-
day  historical volatility  was steady at 2.64 percent. The MSCI
 Asia Pacific Index (MXAPJ)  of  shares  slumped 0.9 percent, extending its
slide this week to 1.6 percent.  Bearish IMF Report  European banks may need to sell as much as $4.5 trillion in
assets through 2013 if policy makers fall short of pledges to
stem the region’s fiscal crisis, the IMF said in a report
released today. That’s 18 percent more than the Washington-based
lender estimated in April. The IMF lowered its international
growth forecast for 2012 to 3.3 percent, compared with a July
estimate of 3.5 percent.  The peso dropped the most in two weeks after the statistics
office said exports fell 9 percent in August from a year
earlier, compared with a median forecast for a 5.5 percent gain
in a Bloomberg survey. Shipments rose 6 percent in July.  The ringgit touched the lowest level in almost two weeks
ahead of a government report that may show factory output fell 2
percent in August from a year earlier, the first drop since July
2011. Exports decreased 4.5 percent in August, following a 2.6
percent decline in July, official data showed last week.  “The weak factory output data tomorrow could be another
excuse to sell the ringgit,” said  Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-
based economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. “People are still
chewing over the IMF’s bearish report.”  Korean Rate Decision  Korea’s currency dropped the most since Sept. 20 before the
Bank of Korea’s policy meeting, at which 13 of 16 economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg forecast it will cut the seven-day
repurchase rate to 2.75 percent. Three predict no change.  The  yuan  appreciated 0.07 percent to 6.2833 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency approached a 19-year high, reversing an
earlier decline, on speculation fund inflows into  emerging
markets  will increase after U.S. Federal Reserve pledged last
month to keep borrowing costs near zero through mid-2015.  The People’s Bank of China weakened its  reference rate  for
the yuan to 6.3449, the lowest since Sept. 27. The Chinese
currency rallied 3.6 percent in 2010, 4.7 percent in 2011 and is
0.2 stronger this year.  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah rose 0.1 percent to 9,593 and
the Vietnamese dong gained 0.1 percent to 20,855. Financial
markets in  Taiwan  are closed for a holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
