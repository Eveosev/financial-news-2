Realogy Holdings Corp. (RLGY) , the real
estate brokerage company that’s controlled by  Apollo Global
Management LLC (APO) , raised $1.08 billion in an initial public
offering, pricing the shares at the top of the proposed range.  Realogy, which owns brokerage brands such as Coldwell
Banker and Century 21, sold 40 million shares for $27 each,
according to a statement yesterday, after offering them for $23
to $27 apiece, representing a 31 percent stake. The shares will
be listed on the  New York  Stock Exchange under the symbol RLGY.  Apollo, which was set to maintain a 50.2 percent stake in
Realogy after the IPO, sought to take the company public almost
six years after buying it as U.S.  home prices  headed for their
worst collapse since the 1930s. Parsippany, New Jersey-based
Realogy planned to use proceeds from the sale to help reduce
debt by more than a third, to $4.5 billion, regulatory filings
show.  The IPO also came as  Leon Black ’s Apollo prepares to raise
a new fund of $10 billion to $12 billion, people familiar with
the situation said in August.  Berry Plastics Group Inc. (BERY) , also
owned by Apollo, completed an IPO last week, pricing the shares
at the low end of the marketed range and since declining in
public trading. Apollo-owned companies  CKE Inc. (CK)  and Momentive
Performance Materials Holdings LLC shelved offerings this year.  Apollo’s Stake  Apollo invested $1.05 billion in Realogy in the buyout,
which was valued at $6.8 billion and completed in 2007,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The firm announced the
acquisition in December 2006, five months after home  prices 
peaked, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index.  At the midpoint of the IPO price range, Apollo’s stake
would be valued at $1.63 billion. Paulson & Co., the hedge fund
run by  John Paulson , was set to own a 10 percent stake in the
company following the IPO, filings show.  After the IPO and related transactions that convert debt to
equity, the midpoint price would give Realogy net debt of $4.5
billion as of June 30. It would have an enterprise value of
$7.77 billion, or about 16 times earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of $500 million in the 12
months through June 30.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were
hired to manage Realogy’s IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
