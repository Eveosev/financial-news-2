SAG Solarstrom AG (SAG) , a German
renewables developer, plans to build 440 megawatts of solar
generation capacity in  Spain ’s Extremadura region with partners.  Solarstrom agreed with Valsolar 2006 SL and Cavalum SGPS SA
to develop a 165-megawatt project in the Bienvenida district and
three smaller plants in Calzadilla de la Serena, it said today
in a statement. The total investment will be in the “three-
digit million range,” according to the Freiburg-based company.  Construction may start in the second half of 2013,
Solarstrom said. The German developer, which will own 51 percent
of the venture building the plants, will seek to sell the output
through power-purchase agreements with utilities and has backing
from local authorities, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
