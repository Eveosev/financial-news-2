Evidence that  Lance Armstrong ’s U.S.
Postal Service cycling team was involved in systematic doping is
“overwhelming,” the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said.  The agency said in a news release that it had compiled more
than 1,000 pages of evidence against Armstrong and the team,
which will be sent today to the Internatinal Cycling Union, the
 World Anti-Doping Agency  and the World Triathlon Corp.  “The evidence shows beyond any doubt that the U.S. Postal
Service Pro Cycling Team ran the most sophisticated,
professionalized and successful doping program that sport has
ever seen,” USADA said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
