The European Parliament’s Economic
and Monetary Affairs Committee will hold a hearing on Oct. 22 to
consider the nomination of Luxembourg’s central bank chief Yves Mersch to fill a vacancy on the European Central Bank’s
Executive Board.  Mersch’s nomination was put in limbo last month when the
committee objected to the lack of female candidates for the post
and postponed a planned hearing. Today the committee decided to
set a date and prepare an opinion on his candidacy, committee
head  Sharon Bowles  said by e-mail in Brussels.  The ECB seat has been empty since June 1. Mersch, the euro
region’s longest serving central banker, was selected by
European finance ministers in July. The assembly’s decision to
proceed with the appointment process comes after ECB President
 Mario Draghi  and Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen called
for a speedy resolution to the impasse.  “In this time of crisis, the Executive Board should be
completed and this nomination should go through,” Draghi told
lawmakers yesterday.  European leaders will confirm Mersch’s appointment soon, a
European Union official said today on condition of anonymity.
The Luxembourg Central Bank declined to comment.  Bowles on Oct. 7 joined the race to succeed  Mervyn King  as
governor of the  Bank of England .  To contact the reporters on this story:
