Mexico’s peso fell the most in a
month after  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded Spain two levels,
deepening concern that Europe’s debt crisis will curb global
growth and erode demand for Latin American exports.  The peso slid 0.8 percent to 12.9774 per  U.S. dollar  at 4
p.m. in Mexico City, its biggest one-day drop since Sept. 10.
Its 7.4 percent advance in 2012 is still the most among the
dollar’s 16 most-traded counterparts.  The peso extended declines as S&P downgraded Spain two
levels to BBB-, the lowest investment rating and one notch below
Mexico’s BBB grade, citing mounting economic and political
risks. European turmoil and concern about how it would weigh on
global growth and the overall market for the Latin American
country’s exports helped make the peso the worst-performing
major currency in the region last year.  “The lowering of Spain’s rating was a big influence” in
the peso’s drop today,  Mario Copca , a currency strategist at
Metanalisis SA, said by phone from Mexico City. It presents “a
risk of bigger outflows toward U.S. Treasuries, which by
definition are a refuge for flows in moments of uncertainty.”  The peso may strengthen to its highest level versus the
U.S. dollar in more than a year following a corrective phase,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. technical analyst  Niall O’Connor  wrote in a
research note published today.  The yield on Mexican fixed-rate local-currency bonds due in
2024 increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
5.34 percent. The price dropped 0.09 centavo to 141.65 centavos
per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
