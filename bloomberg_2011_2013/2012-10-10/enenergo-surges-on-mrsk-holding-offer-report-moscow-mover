OAO Lenenergo jumped to a four-month
high, on concern OAO MRSK Holding, the nation’s largest
electricity distribution company, may overpay for a stake in the
power transmission operator.  Lenenergo surged as much as 7.7 percent before closing up
1.6 percent at 7.363 rubles, the highest level since May 21.
MRSK Holding sank as much as 2.5 percent before closing down 1.7
percent at 2.080 rubles, the lowest level since Sept. 7.  MRSK Holding has proposed swapping a 49 percent stake in
Kurganenergo for a stake in Lenenergo, the company said in a
 statement . For the transaction, Lenenergo shares will be valued
at 13.9 rubles a share, it said, a 92 percent premium to
yesterday’s closing price.  “The fact that MRSK Holding once again agrees with the
extremely high valuation of the asset only aggravates the
negative market sentiment,” Alfa Bank analysts led by Alexander Kornilov, said in an e-mailed note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
