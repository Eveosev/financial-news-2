Bonds of  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ)  fell after the
bankrupt airline company sought court permission to repay $1.3
billion of the securities without honoring an early redemption
provision and not paying a premium on the debt.  AMR’s $174.2 million of 13 percent secured notes due in
August 2016 dropped 3 cents to 103.5 cents on the dollar at 8:31
a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Its
$703.6 million of 8.625 pass-through certificates plunged 4
cents to 103.5.  The airline wants to redeem the 13 percent notes, the 8.625
certificates and $445.6 million of 10.375 percent pass-through
debt, “without the payment of any make-whole amount” or “any
other premium or prepayment penalty,” the company said in a
filing yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.  AMR, based in  Fort Worth , Texas, said interest-expense
savings under the financing may be more than $200 million. The
request requires approval from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane.  To contact the reporter on this story:
