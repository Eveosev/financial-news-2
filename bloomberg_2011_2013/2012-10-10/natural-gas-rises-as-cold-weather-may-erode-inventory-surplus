Natural gas futures gained for a
third day in  New York  amid forecasts of below-normal
temperatures that may reduce a glut of the fuel in storage.  Gas climbed 0.2 percent. The weather may be cooler than
normal in the Northeast through Oct. 14, according to MDA
EarthSat Weather. An Energy Department report tomorrow may show
that stockpiles rose 78 billion cubic feet last week, below the
five-year average increase of 84 billion, based on the median of
20 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “Anticipation of winter weather continues to underpin the
level of gas prices we’ve reached,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“We continue to erase the inventory surplus.”  Natural gas for November delivery rose 0.8 cent to settle
at $3.475 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures have gained 16 percent in 2012.  December $4.50 calls, bets that prices will rise, were the
most active gas options in electronic trading. They were
unchanged at 2 cents on volume of 661 contracts as of 2:43 p.m.
Calls accounted for 57 percent of options volume.  The high in New York on Oct. 12 may be 62 degrees
Fahrenheit (17 Celsius), 3 below normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The high in
 Chicago  may be 55 degrees, 9 less than the usual reading.  Heating demand in the U.S. may be 35 percent above normal
on Oct. 12, data from Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri ,
show. About 51 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Department.  Peak Demand  The heating season from November through March is the  peak
demand  period for U.S. gas consumption. Last winter was the
fourth-warmest on record in the lower 48 states,  cutting fuel
consumption . About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  The winter of 2012-2013 will probably bring a boost to
heating fuels compared with last year and leave above-normal
snowfall from  Massachusetts  to  Alabama , AccuWeather Inc. said.  The coldest part of the winter will probably be in
February, with slightly warmer-than-average weather in December
that may bring the entire season near normal, said  Paul Pastelok , long-range forecaster for AccuWeather in State
College, Pennsylvania.  Gas stockpiles totaled 3.653 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Sept. 28, 8.3 percent above the five-year average for
the week, according to the Energy Department. The surplus has
been declining since March.  U.S. natural gas production in 2012 will average 68.85
billion cubic feet a day, the department said today in its
monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. The estimate was little
changed from 68.86 billion in last month’s report.  Gas Boom  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first six months of the year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  Demand from electricity generators will average 25.36
billion cubic feet a day, up from 25.21 billion forecast in
September, according to the report. Gas use by  power plants  will
climb 22 percent this year.  The number of rigs drilling for gas rose by 2 to 437 last
week, according to data released Oct. 5 by Baker Hughes Inc. in
Houston. The rig count is down 46 percent this year.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
