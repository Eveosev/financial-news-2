Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) , the largest
U.S. warehouse-club chain, posted fiscal fourth-quarter profit
that topped analystsâ€™ estimates as low prices drove sales.  Net income  in the quarter ended Aug. 31 rose 27 percent to
$609 million, or $1.39 a share, from $478 million, or $1.08, a
year earlier, the Issaquah, Washington-based company said today
in a statement. Analysts projected $1.31, the average of 25
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Craig Jelinek has been keeping
prices low and adding more service areas, such as vision
centers, to increase store visits. The retailer also has been
selling more private-label goods to improve profit margins.  Costco rose 3.3 percent to $102.92 at 9:43 a.m. in  New York 
and earlier climbed as much as 3.9 percent for the biggest
intraday gain since Aug. 11, 2011. The shares added 20 percent
this year through yesterday.  Revenue from membership fees advanced 18 percent to $694
million, the company said.  Same-store sales, a key metric for retailers because only
established locations are counted, rose 6 percent, excluding
changes in  gas prices  and currency rates, the company reported
on Oct. 4. Net sales gained 14 percent to $31.5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
