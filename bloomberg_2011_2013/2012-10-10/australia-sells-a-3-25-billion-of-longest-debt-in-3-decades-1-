Australia  sold A$3.25 billion ($3.3
billion) of notes due in 16 1/2 years, the longest-maturity
bonds on record in government data going back to 1982, matching
its largest ever offering.  The 3.25 percent April 2029 security was placed via
syndication and yielded 3.595 percent, according to an e-mailed
statement from the Australian Office of Financial Management.
Notes due April 2027 were previously the nation’s longest-dated
debt.  Foreign investors seeking the world’s highest-yielding AAA
rated sovereign debt hold a near-record 77.5 percent of
Australian  government bonds , government data show. The U.K. gilt
due July 2052 offers the highest top-graded rates outside of
Australian securities, at 3.24 percent. Prime Minister  Julia
Gillard ’s plan to end four years of budget deficits has also
driven demand for federal debt. The benchmark 10-year note
touched an all-time low of 2.698 percent in June.  The  10-year rate  was at 3.08 percent as of 3:45 p.m. in
Sydney, while the 15-year yield was 3.39 percent. The Australian
dollar bought $1.0220.  The last time Australia extended its yield curve was in
October 2011, when it sold A$3.25 billion in 15 1/2-year
securities.  Australia has now sold A$16.25 billion of the A$35 billion
in Treasury bonds it  plans  to offer in the 2012-2013 financial
year, according to AOFM data.  After accounting for maturities of A$26 billion, net
issuance for the current financial year is expected to be $9
billion, government data show. The  net figure  for 2011-12 was
A$44 billion, with gross issuance of A$58 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
