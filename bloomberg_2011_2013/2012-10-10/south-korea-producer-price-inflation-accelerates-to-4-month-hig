South Koreaâ€™s producer prices rose
at the fastest pace in four months after typhoons damaged crops
and international oil prices increased.  Prices rose 1 percent in September from a year earlier,
after a 0.3 percent increase in August, the  Bank of Korea  said
in a statement today. The gain was 0.7 percent from the previous
month.  The Bank of Korea may reduce its benchmark rate to 2.75
percent today after a surprise cut in July, according to 13 out
of 16 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
