Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the worldâ€™s
largest producer of wind turbines, fired 75 workers at a factory
in Brighton, Colorado, the Associated Press reported.  Vestas fired about 30 workers at the same plant on Aug. 21
and about 90 workers at a plant in Pueblo, Colorado, Aug. 13, as
the company cuts its global workforce about 16 percent this year
to 19,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
