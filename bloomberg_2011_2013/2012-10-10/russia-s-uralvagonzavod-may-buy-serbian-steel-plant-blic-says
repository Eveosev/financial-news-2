NPO Uralvagonzavod OAO, a Russian
state-owned maker of battle tanks and railcars, will probably
buy  Zelezara Smederevo d.o.o. ,  Serbia ’s sole steel plant,  Blic 
reported, citing an unidentified person.  The Serbian government, which invited bids for Zelezara on
Oct. 8, has been negotiating with Uralvagonzavod for weeks, as
it seeks an investor for the unprofitable plant that it bought
back from  U.S. Steel Corp (X)  in January, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
