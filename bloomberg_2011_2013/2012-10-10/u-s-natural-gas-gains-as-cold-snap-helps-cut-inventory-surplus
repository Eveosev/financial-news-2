Natural gas futures declined for the
first time in three days on forecasts of warmer weather that
would limit demand for the heating fuel.  Gas slid as much as 0.5 percent. Temperatures may be above
normal across most of the continental U.S. from Oct. 15 through
Oct. 19, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
Maryland. Stockpiles may reach a record 3.95 trillion cubic feet
before cold weather boosts demand, Energy Department data show.  “The near-term  weather forecasts  aren’t providing support
for the gas market,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker
at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “We’re still
heading toward a new record in storage levels.”  Natural gas for November delivery fell 1.1 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $3.456 per million British thermal units at 9:13
a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. The futures have
declined 2.4 percent from a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
