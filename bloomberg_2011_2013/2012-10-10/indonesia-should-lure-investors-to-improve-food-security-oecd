Indonesia , the worldâ€™s biggest palm
oil producer and second largest for rubber, should make
agriculture more attractive for investors to improve food
security, said the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.  Restrictions on foreign ownership, complicated land rights,
the need for many permits and licenses and inadequate transport
and irrigation systems are among factors discouraging investors,
it said in a review of agricultural policies.  Foreign and domestic investment in agriculture is
relatively low compared with its share of gross domestic product
and employment, it said. The country is the 10th largest
agricultural producer, just behind Turkey and France and ahead
of Germany and Argentina, and is the third-biggest rice grower
and consumer after China and  India , it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
