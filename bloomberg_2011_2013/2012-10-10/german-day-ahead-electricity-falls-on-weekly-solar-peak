German next-day power rose as  EnBW
Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK)  delayed the start of its
Neckarwestheim-2 nuclear power plant by three days.  Baseload day-ahead electricity, for supplies delivered
around the clock, gained 1.7 percent as EnBW said its 1,310-
megawatt unit would return from maintenance on Oct. 13.  The next-day power contract added 85 cents to 52 euros
($66.90) a megawatt-hour at 5:20 p.m. Berlin time, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The contract settled at 52.69
euros in the daily auction on European Energy Exchange AG.  Cooler temperatures may boost demand for heating. The
minimum temperature in  Frankfurt  is predicted to drop to 2
degrees Celsius (36 Fahrenheit) tomorrow, compared with a five-
year average of 9 degrees, according to CustomWeather Inc. data
on Bloomberg.  Solar generation is forecast to rise to 15 gigawatts
tomorrow from 10 gigawatts today, according to MVV Trading GmbH.
That’s more than the  average level  of 3 gigawatts, according to
data from Leipzig, Germany-based EEX on Bloomberg.  Wind generation will be below average at 1,400 megawatts
tomorrow and close to average levels at 5,400 megawatts on
Friday, Min Soo Park, a power trader at MVV Trading, said by
telephone from  Mannheim ,  Germany .  The 2013 power contract, a European benchmark, was little
changed at 47.75 euros a megawatt-hour.  “The market hasn’t much direction and the volume is quite
low,” Park said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
