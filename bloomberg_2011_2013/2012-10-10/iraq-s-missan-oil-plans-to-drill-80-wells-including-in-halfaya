Missan Oil Co.,  Iraq ’s third-largest
state-owned oil company, plans to drill 80 new wells in the
southeastern region that will boost crude output to as much as
300,000 barrels a day next year, its director general said.  The oilfields in Missan province produce 200,000 barrels a
day, including 100,000 barrels from Halfaya, whose shareholders
include China National Petroleum Corp. and Paris-based  Total SA (FP) ,
Ali Muarej said today in an interview in Baghdad.  Total, CNPC and Petroliam Nasional Bhd., the Malaysian oil
company known as Petronas, are developing Halfaya. CNPC has a 50
percent share in the project, while Total and Petronas each own
25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
