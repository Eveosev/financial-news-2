The euro pared a decline against the
dollar as a report showed Italian industrial production
unexpectedly rose in August.  The 17-member currency weakened 0.1 percent to $1.2869 at
9:06 a.m. London time, after earlier touching $1.2835, the
lowest since Oct. 1. It was little changed at 100.78 yen.  Italian industrial production rose 1.7 percent from July,
when it contracted a revised 0.1 percent. Economists forecast a
decline of 0.5 percent, according to the median of 18 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
