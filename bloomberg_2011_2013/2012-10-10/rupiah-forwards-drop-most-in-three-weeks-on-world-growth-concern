Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards dropped
by the most in three weeks after foreign funds sold the nation’s
stocks on concern the global economy is slowing.  Government
bonds  declined and the local currency advanced.  Overseas funds sold $9.7 million more local shares than
they bought yesterday, the biggest outflow since Sept. 25,
exchange data show. The  International Monetary Fund  said
yesterday the world economy will expand 3.3 percent this year,
the least since 2009, compared with its July forecast of 3.5
percent. Bank Indonesia’s foreign-exchange  holdings  rose for a
third month to $110 billion in September, the most since May.  “Concern about global growth prompted investors to seek
safety,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, the head of treasury research
at PT Bank Negara Indonesia in Jakarta. “The spot price will be
more stable than the forwards, as  Bank Indonesia  has ample
reserves and is committed to guarding the rupiah.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.7 percent to
10,134 per dollar as of 3:47 p.m. in Jakarta, the biggest drop
since Sept. 18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contracts to buy or sell the rupiah in one year traded at a 5.6
percent discount to the spot rate. Non-deliverable forwards are
settled in dollars.  The rupiah strengthened 0.1 percent to 9,593 per dollar,
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. It reached
9,635 earlier, the weakest level since May 31. One-month implied
volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings used to price
options, held at 6 percent.  Bank Indonesia will meet tomorrow to review its benchmark
 interest rate . All 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect it
to be held for an eighth month at a record-low 5.75 percent.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds maturing in
May 2022 climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
5.90 percent, the highest level since Oct. 1, prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
