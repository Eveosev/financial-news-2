Colombia ’s peso bond yields held
near a record low on speculation a proposed reduction in the
withholding tax for international investors will boost demand
for the  government securities .  The yield on the 7.5 percent peso-denominated bonds due in
August 2026 was little changed at 6.25 percent, according to the
central bank. It was 6.24 percent yesterday, the lowest on a
closing basis since the debt was first sold in 2011.  Legislation sent to Congress last week would reduce taxes
foreigners pay for profits on fixed-income investments to 12.5
percent from 33 percent. Included are government peso bonds sold
in the local market and corporate debt.  “The aggressiveness of this rally has been a surprise,”
said William Florez, an analyst at  Helm Bank SA (PFBHELMB) ’s brokerage in
Bogota. “One of the big recent drivers is the tax bill, which
investors should take with caution since it has to first pass
the four debates in Congress.”  Peso bonds, especially the medium-term securities, still
have room for gains as inflation remains under control,
according to Florez.  Colombia’s annual inflation slowed to 3.08 percent in
September, a report showed Oct. 5, within the central bank’s 2
percent to 4 percent target.  “Real rates are attractive,” said Florez.  The peso depreciated almost 0.1 percent to 1,799.99 per
 U.S. dollar , paring its rally this year to 7.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
