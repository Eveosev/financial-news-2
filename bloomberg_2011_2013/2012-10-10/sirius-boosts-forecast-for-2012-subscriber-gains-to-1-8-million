Sirius XM Radio Inc. (SIRI) , the satellite-
radio broadcaster, rose the most in two months after boosting
its forecast for 2012 subscriber gains to 1.8 million from 1.6
million, helped by growth in auto sales.  Sirius added 445,921 subscribers in the third quarter,
bringing its total customer base to a record 23.4 million, the
New York-based company said today in a statement.  The period marked the best third quarter since the merger
of Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio in 2008, Chief
Executive Officer Mel Karmazin said in the statement. Sirius is
also on track for record annual net additions. Most new cars
have the satellite service as a built-in feature, giving the
company a boost from the resurgent  auto industry .  “With almost 1.5 million net subscribers already added in
2012 and continuing growth in auto sales, we will significantly
exceed our previous guidance of 1.6 million,” Karmazin said.  Sirius rose or 4.6 percent to $2.75 at the close in  New
York , its biggest gain since Aug. 8. The stock has risen 51
percent this year.  Sirius added 1.7 million customers last year. The service
is preinstalled in about two-thirds of new cars, Karmazin said
in September.  Karmazin’s job status with Sirius remains unclear. His
contract with the company runs out at the end of the year.
Englewood, Colorado-based Liberty Media Corp., which holds just
under 50 percent of Sirius’s shares, has informed the Federal
Communications Commission that it intends to take control of the
company. Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei said last month Karmazin
wasn’t “irreplaceable.”  Liberty Chairman  John Malone  said in July he intends to
spin off the stake in New York-based Sirius if Liberty’s
takeover plan gets approval. Karmazin has said that such a move
might increase his interest in staying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
