Thousands of chicken died at poultry
farms in  Russia ’s Kirov area after owners underfed the birds,
according to a regional branch of the country’s food safety
agency.  At least 75,000 chickens died since Oct. 5 at several farms
in Kirov, the service, known as Rosselkhoznadzor, said yesterday
on its  website .  Owners reduced the amount of feed to 12 metric tons daily
instead of a 30-ton norm at one of the farms, it said.
Rosselkhoznadzor officials are investigating, the agency said,
without elaborating on possible reasons for the underfeeding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
