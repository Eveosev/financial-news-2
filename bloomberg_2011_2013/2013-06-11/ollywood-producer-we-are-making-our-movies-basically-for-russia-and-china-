To find where Hollywood is headed, go east, young man. China is the second-largest movie market, and is on pace to become the biggest in the world by the end of the decade, according to Lynda Obst. The Hollywood producer, whose film credits include "Contact" and "Sleepless in Seattle," is the author of "Sleepless in Hollywood: Tales From the New Abnormal in the Movie Business." "So much of the enormous talent that used to populate the movie business, which is the people who made our best dramas, the people who made our best comedies, have sort of been frozen out of the blockbuster market that is feeding China, which really wants our 3-D and our IMAX," Obst said in an interview today on  Bloomberg Television . "We are making our movies, basically, for Russia and China -- which means you will never see a Russian and Chinese bad guy again. Thank God for the North Koreans."
