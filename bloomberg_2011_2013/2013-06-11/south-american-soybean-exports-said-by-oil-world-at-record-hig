South American soybean exports rose
to a record in May, even as rain hampered loading and strikes in
 Brazil  and Argentina curbed shipments, Oil World reported.  Brazil, Argentina,  Paraguay  and Uruguay jointly exported
11.1 million tons of beans last month, up from 9.61 million tons
in May 2012, the Hamburg-based researcher wrote in an e-mailed
report. Shipments rose from 10 million tons in April.  “Soybean exports out of  South America  did not fully come
up to expectations,” Oil World wrote. “The major reason is to
be seen in considerable rainfall in the second half of May,
which impeded loading, primarily at several Brazilian ports.”  Increased deliveries by South America’s four major soybean
exporters coincided with a plunge of shipments from the U.S.,
with shipments falling 500,000 tons from 1.8 million tons in May
2012, according to Oil World.  Brazil shipped a record 7.95 million tons of soybeans in
May, less than Oil World’s forecast for 8.3 million tons and
compared with 7.29 million tons a year earlier. Exports since
the start of January rose to a record 19.6 million tons from
18.5 million tons in the first five months of 2012, the
researcher wrote.  Argentina  exported about 1.7 million tons of beans, 200,000
tons less than expected and up from 1.27 million tons in May
2012.  Paraguay’s soybean shipments rose to 770,000 tons from
540,000 tons, lifting exports since January to a record 3.13
million tons from 1.81 million tons, according to Oil World.  Uruguay exported 710,000 tons from a year-earlier 520,000
tons, boosting exports this year by 50 percent to a record 1.52
million tons, the researcher reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
