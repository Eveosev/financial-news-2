Keller Group Plc (KLR)  plans to acquire
Canadian foundations company North American Piling for a maximum
payment of C$320 million ($314 million) to tap growing
construction and energy markets in the region.  The purchase from  North American Energy Partners Inc. (NOA)  will
add a business that generated C$236.5 million in annual revenue
and operating profit of C$38.5 million, London-based Keller said
in a statement today. The deal will be financed by a placing and
existing credit lines.  “The board has identified Canada as a key target market
and this acquisition of a complementary piling business
represents an excellent opportunity to build substantially on
Keller’s existing presence in that market,” Chief Executive
Officer Justin Atkinson said in a statement. “North American
Piling is a market-leading business with attractive margins
positioned in growth markets, including the resource-rich
regions of Western  Canada .”  Keller is looking to raise 58.7 million pounds ($91
million) in a share sale to help provide funds for its
acquisition. Investec Bank Plc and Jefferies International Ltd.
are acting as joint bookrunners.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
