Chicago  gasoline weakened for a
sixth day, the longest streak of declines since December, on
speculation inventories of the motor fuel will get a boost from
the restart of  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Joliet,  Illinois , refinery.  The premium for conventional, 85-octane gasoline slid 22
cents to  28 cents a gallon  versus futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 2:39 p.m., the smallest premium since May
29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The differential tightened 57 cents in the past six days of
trading after Exxon completed maintenance at the  238,000 barrel-a-day Joliet refinery , the fifth-largest in the U.S. Midwest.
The plant-wide turnaround, which began April 14, shut major
operating units for the duration of the work.  Return of Joliet may boost stockpiles in the region, which
Energy Information Administration data show were 152,000 barrels
below the  five-year average  for the time of year as of May 31.  “Exxon got caught in a position where maintenance may have
taken longer than expected,” Patrick DeHaan, a Chicago-based
gas analyst at GasBuddy.com, said by phone. “They were caught
buying between when they originally thought they’d be done and
what the reality was and the market may have overreacted.”  Chicago gasoline  peaked  at a premium of 85 cents a gallon
versus Nymex futures on June 3, the highest level in data going
back to 1996.  Stockpiles of motor fuel in the Midwest, known as PADD 2,
were  48.4 million barrels  in the week ended May 31, after
dropping to a five-month low in early May, EIA data showed.  The 3-2-1  crack spread  in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , dropped $6.71 to $34.16 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
