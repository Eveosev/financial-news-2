London police arrested six people
today after protests in the West End shopping district before a
Group of Eight summit hosted by U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  in  Northern Ireland  next week.  Television pictures showed a building in Soho occupied by
demonstrators. The group StopG8 called the action a “carnival
against capitalism.” Police officers later blocked access to
Fortnum & Mason Plc’s luxury store on Piccadilly, which was the
focus of rioting in 2011 against U.K. government spending cuts.  The six arrests were for an assault on police, criminal
damage, possessing an offensive weapon, possession of articles
with intent to commit criminal damage and failing to remove a
face covering, the Metropolitan Police said in an e-mailed
statement.  “We have sought to engage with protest groups who were
proposing action around G-8 through our police liaison teams but
at this stage no groups or individuals have engaged with us,”
the Met said. “We would continue to ask anyone who wants to
protest in  London  around the G-8 summit to contact us so that we
can work with them and facilitate peaceful protest.”  Leaders from Russia, Germany, France, the U.S., Japan,
 Italy  and Canada will join Cameron at the Lough Erne resort in
County Fermanagh for the conference of G-8 leaders on June 17-18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
