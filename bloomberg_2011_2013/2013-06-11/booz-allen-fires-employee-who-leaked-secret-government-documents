Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp. (BAH) 
said it has fired Edward Snowden, who revealed a top-secret U.S.
electronic surveillance program.  The federal consulting company, based in McLean,  Virginia ,
said today in a  statement  that the 29-year-old had a salary of
$122,000 and was fired for “violations of the firm’s code of
ethics and firm policy.”  Snowden had worked for the company for less than three
months, assigned to a team in Hawaii. He was fired yesterday.  He voluntarily disclosed that he had provided journalists
with secret documents describing the program, in a video
interview posted Saturday on the website of the U.K.’s Guardian
newspaper.  A former technical assistant for the Central Intelligence
Agency, he had worked the National Security Agency for the past
four years for various contractors, according to reports by the
Guardian and the Washington Post, which said Snowden provided
them with documents.  He copied the last set of documents he wanted to disclose
three weeks ago at the NSA office in  Hawaii  where he worked as a
Booz Allen contractor, the Guardian reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
