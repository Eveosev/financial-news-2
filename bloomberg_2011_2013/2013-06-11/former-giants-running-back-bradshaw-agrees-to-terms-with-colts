Former  New York Giants  running back
 Ahmad Bradshaw  has agreed to join the  Indianapolis Colts ,
according to the National Football League team’s website.  Bradshaw, 27, had a team-leading 1,015 rushing yards and
six touchdowns for the Giants last season. He had surgery this
offseason to repair a broken bone in his right foot and was
released by New York in February.  A two-time Super Bowl champion with the Giants, Bradshaw
rushed for 4,232 yards and 32 touchdowns in six seasons in New
York. The 2007 seventh-round draft pick also has 132 career
receptions for three scores.  Bradshaw’s 4,232 career rushing yards rank sixth in Giants
franchise history. He was due to make $3.75 million next year in
New York before he was released, clearing the way for 2012
first-round pick  David Wilson  and Andre Brown to compete for the
starting job.  The Colts rushed for 104.4 yards per game last season, 11th
in the 16-team American Football Conference. Rookie Vick
Ballard, the team’s leading rusher in 2012, ran for 814 yards
and two scores.  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporters on this story:
