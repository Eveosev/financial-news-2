Both Light and Heavy Louisiana Sweet
oils strengthened versus domestic benchmark West Texas
Intermediate as other Gulf crudes weakened.  Premiums for Light and Heavy Louisiana Sweet rose 20 and 10
cents, respectively, against WTI, to $9.40 and $9.60 a barrel as
of 1:57 p.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Six other oils produced in the Gulf of Mexico fell, led by
Poseidon, which dropped $1.30 to $2.60 a barrel, its lowest
premium since Jan. 21, 2011, after WTI strengthened against
Brent. The discount for the U.S. benchmark versus its European
counterpart narrowed 63 cents to $7.55 a barrel based on
settlement prices. Gulf crudes compete for space in U.S.
refineries with foreign oils priced against Brent.  The two Louisiana Sweet grades are stronger than other Gulf
crudes when WTI strengthens against Brent because they are
increasingly used as hedges for South American and Central
American crudes, said Carl Larry, Houston-based president of Oil
Outlooks & Opinions LLC.  “You really have to look at HLS and LLS as the U.S.
Brent,”  Larry said. “LLS and HLS will still be able to find
strength when WTI rallies, or when Brent comes in to WTI.”  Southern Green Canyon weakened by 50 cents to a $2 premium.
Mars Blend’s premium to WTI lost 60 cents to $3.40 a barrel.  The premium for Thunder Horse, which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, weakened
by 55 cents to $5.90 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
