Norway  will experience a slowdown in
employment growth this year as exporters and manufacturers scale
back hiring amid a strong krone and weak demand from  Europe ,
according to the  Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise .  Companies represented by NHO, Norway’s biggest employer
group, plan to increase the size of their workforce by 0.8
percent in 2013, less than the previous estimate of 1.6 percent,
the group said in its quarterly survey of 2,700 companies.
Industrial organisations expect a 0.3 percent decline in
employment this year, according to the report.  “The weak global economy is now fully impacting the
Norwegian economy, leading to a marked slowdown in economic
growth,” Dag Aarnes, deputy director at the Oslo-based group,
said in a statement. “More cautious households and fewer orders
to Norwegian producers from the oil sector are also dampening
growth.”  A recession in Europe has started to hurt the world’s
fourth-richest nation per capita. Exporters have struggled to
cope with a record high  import-weighted krone  and slowing demand
from the debt-burdened euro area.  Norway’s economy will expand at a slower pace than
previously forecast as sales abroad stagnated,  Statistics
Norway  said on May 30. The  mainland economy , which excludes
income from the oil and shipping industries, will grow 2.4
percent this year, down from 3.4 percent in 2012, the statistics
agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
