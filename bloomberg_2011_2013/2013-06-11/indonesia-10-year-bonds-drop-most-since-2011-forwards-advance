Indonesia’s 10-year  government bonds 
slumped the most since 2011 as global investors pulled money
from local notes amid speculation policy makers may scale back
stimulus measures. The rupiah’s one-month forwards rose.  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 soared 36
basis points to 6.713 percent in Jakarta, according to the
Inter-Dealer Market Association. That’s the biggest increase
since September 2011 for a  benchmark  10-year government bonds.  The  Bank of Japan  today refrained from changing the one-year fixed-rate loan facility the bank has tapped into seven
times, adding to concerns that the  Federal Reserve  may taper its
monthly bond purchases that boost the supply of dollars. Global
funds  reduced  holdings of local bonds for a sixth day on June 5,
according to latest finance ministry data.  “Data continue to show outflows in both debt and equity
markets, and there are signs of acceleration,” Wee-Khoon Chong,
Hong Kong-based strategist at Societe Generale SA, wrote in a
report today.  The rupiah fell 0.1 percent to 9,826 per dollar, according
to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, climbed 72 basis points to 14
percent.  The one-month non-deliverable forwards rose 1 percent,
trading at a 4.2 percent discount to the spot rate quoted by
Indonesian banks, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
government is concerned at the widening gap between rupiah
forwards and the spot rate, Deputy Finance Minister Mahendra
Siregar told reporters in Jakarta today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
