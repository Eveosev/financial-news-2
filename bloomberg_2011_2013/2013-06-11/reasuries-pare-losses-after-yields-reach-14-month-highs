Treasury 30-year bonds rose for the
first time in three days, reversing earlier losses, as investors
bet yields at 14-month highs offered enough of a premium amid
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will slow asset purchases.  Yields had reached the highest since April 2012 on concern
this month’s rise would prompt investors to sell even more
government debt as a hedge against losses on mortgage bonds.
Stocks and commodities tumbled, stoking the refuge appeal of
Treasuries, as concern increased that central banks are pulling
back on stimulus measures and low financing. Investors snapped
up three-year notes after a lackluster  auction .  “This large selloff in the  bond market  has provided people
with the opportunity to get into long bonds, and they’re taking
it,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury trading at Bank of
 Nova Scotia  in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade
with the Fed.  The  30-year bond  yield dropped six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 3.31 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It rose earlier to
3.43 percent, the highest since April 2012. The price of the
2.875 percent security maturing May 2043 rose 31/32, or $9.69
per $1,000 face value, to 91 22/32.  Ten-year note  yields declined three basis points to 2.19
percent after increasing earlier to 2.29 percent, also the
highest since April 2012.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index was at 82.34, after rising yesterday to
84.75, the highest level in almost a year. It has averaged 62.4
over the past 12 months.  Volume Rises  Trading  volume  handled by ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , increased 48 percent to
$532 billion, from $359 billion on June 10. Volume surged to
$662 billion on May 22, the highest level in data going back to
2004, according to ICAP.  The 30-year Treasury bond extended gains as stocks and
commodities fell, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index sliding 1
percent and S&P’s GSCI Index of raw materials losing 0.7
percent. The yen strengthened versus the dollar as the decline
in U.S. yields damped the allure of the greenback, and as  Bank
of Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda left a lending program
unchanged, stoking concern central banks are growing reluctant
to add more stimulus.  ‘Reestablished Themselves’  “Within the last several trading sessions there’s been a
breakdown of the traditional risk-on, risk-off dynamic that
we’ve seen in place for the last several quarters,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “What we saw overnight was a sell-stocks, sell-bonds dynamic. Treasuries seem to have once again
reestablished themselves as the flight-to-quality asset.”  Bonds also gained amid inflation that’s below the Fed’s 2
percent target rate. The U.S. personal consumption expenditure
deflator, the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, rose 0.7
percent in April from a year earlier, the smallest increase
since 2009.  Treasuries weakened just after the U.S. sold $32 billion of
three-year notes at a yield of 0.581 percent, the highest since
July 2011. A Bloomberg News survey of traders before the auction
had forecast a yield of 0.575 percent.  The amount of bids at the offering relative to debt sold, a
gauge of demand known as the  bid-to-cover  ratio, was 2.95, the
weakest since December 2010.  Less Demand  Demand for Treasuries at auction has slackened amid signs
of improvement with the  U.S. economy . Investors have bid $2.98
for each dollar of debt sold at the U.S. government’s $937
billion in Treasury notes and bonds sold at auction this year
compared with of $3.15 set in 2012, according to Treasury data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The ratio is still the fourth-highest since at least 1994,
following 3.04 in 2011 and 2.99 in 2010. It was 2.50 in 2009.  At today’s auction, primary dealers purchased 58.4 percent
of the notes, versus an average of 53.9 percent at the past 10
auctions.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 33.1 percent of the offering,
compared with 30.7 percent at last month’s sale. The average at
the past 10 offerings was 25.9 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place their bids directly with the
Treasury, purchased 8.4 percent, the fewest since last August.
The average at the past 10 auctions was 19.9 percent.  The U.S. will auction $21 billion in 10-year notes tomorrow
and $13 billion in 30-year bonds on June 13.  Fed Bets  Ten-year note yields  climbed  46 basis points in May amid
increasing speculation that the Fed, the largest holder of
Treasuries with $1.89 trillion, may begin to scale back its bond
buying. It was the biggest jump since a 50 basis-point advance
in December 2010. The central bank has increased its holdings of
Treasuries by $234.4 billion in 2013.  The Fed is purchasing $45 billion of Treasuries and $40
billion of mortgage securities each month to put downward
pressure on borrowing costs in its third round of quantitative-easing stimulus since 2008. It bought $1.38 billion of Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities today maturing from February 2041
to February 2043.  The central bank will reduce its purchases to $65 billion a
month at its October meeting, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey of economists last week.  “Some investors are starting to step in here” with yields
at long-time highs, said Justin Lederer, an interest rate
strategist at the primary dealer Cantor Fitzgerald LP in  New
York . “There’s a little anxiety about 10s and bonds. The market
is a little volatile, a little nervous.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
