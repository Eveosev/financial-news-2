Naspers Ltd. (NPN) ,  Africa ’s largest media
group, said full-year earnings per share rose as much as 25
percent after the depreciation of the rand helped boost its
overseas profit.  So-called headline earnings per share, excluding non-recurring and non-operational items, were 15 percent to 25
percent higher in the 12 months through March compared with 1.85
rand a year earlier, the Cape Town-based company said in a
statement today.  “The majority of our core headline earnings are generated
from operations offshore,” the company said. “The currency-translation effect of the depreciation of the rand relative to
the prior period will play a significant role in boosting
expected headline earnings growth.”  Naspers, which owns stakes in Russian social networking and
gaming site  Mail.ru Group Ltd. (MAIL)  and Hong Kong-based  Tencent
Holdings Ltd. (700) , said earnings per share including one-time items
will be 100 percent to 110 percent higher than the previous
period’s 770 cents because of the sale of a portion of Mail.ru’s
stake in Facebook Inc.  The rand has weakened 16 percent against the dollar this
year, making it the worst performer of 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
