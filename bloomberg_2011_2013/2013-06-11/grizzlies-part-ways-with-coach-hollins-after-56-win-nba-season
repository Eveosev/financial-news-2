The  Memphis  Grizzlies said they
won’t offer coach Lionel Hollins a new contract after a season
in which the team reached the National Basketball Association’s
Western Conference finals for the first time.  Hollins’s contract expires June 30 and the team opted to
make a change due to philosophical differences between the coach
and the front office, the  Commercial Appeal of Memphis  said,
citing unidentified people close to management.  “After a thorough internal process, which included
conversations with Lionel and his representatives, we decided as
an organization to move in a different direction,” Grizzlies
Chief Executive Jason Levien said in a statement.  The Grizzlies had a franchise-best 56-26 record this season
and reached the Western Conference finals before losing to the
San Antonio Spurs. The team had previously given Hollins
permission to talk with other clubs about coaching vacancies.  Hollins is among three NBA coaches dismissed this offseason
after leading their teams to franchise records for wins in a
season, joining former Denver Nuggets coach George Karl and ex-Los Angeles Clippers coach Vinny Del Negro, according to the
Elias Sports Bureau. Karl met last week with the Grizzlies, USA
Today reported.  Hollins, 59, had a 214-201 record with the Grizzlies, who
he’d coached since 2008. He also had stints as the franchise’s
interim coach during the 1999-2000 and 2004-05 seasons.  “We have begun to identify our next head coach, who we
feel can best move us forward,” Levien said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
