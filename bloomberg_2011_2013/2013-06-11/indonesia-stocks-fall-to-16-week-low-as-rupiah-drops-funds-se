Indonesian stocks  declined, heading
for the lowest close since Feb. 26, as rupiah forwards touched
the lowest level in more than three years and foreign investors
sold the nation’s stocks for the 12th consecutive day.  The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  dropped 2.5 percent to 4,656.59
at 11:42 a.m local time. The gauge has slumped 11 percent since
climbing to a record on May 20, exceeding a drop of 10 percent
that some investors consider a correction. One-month forwards on
the rupiah declined 0.1 percent after falling yesterday to the
weakest level since August 2009.  Asian emerging-market currencies and stocks slumped today
as the U.S. Federal Reserve considers paring asset purchases. A
weaker rupiah threatens the profits of companies that either
rely on imported raw materials or have high dollar-denominated
debt, Andy Ferdinand, analyst at Batavia Prosperindo Sekuritas
said by phone today. Foreign funds sold a net of $1.23 billion
of local stocks in 12 days through June 10, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The market is dropping because of concerns over the
weaker rupiah,” John Teja, a director at Ciptadana Securities,
said by phone today. “The market has gone up so much, some
investors decided to book profit.”  The nation’s stocks were downgraded to underweight today by
UBS AG strategist Nicholas Smithie, who cited rising valuations
that have made them the fourth-most expensive among emerging-market equities after the  Philippines ,  Mexico  and  Chile .  Index Valuations  PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia (TLKM) , the country’s biggest
telecommunications company, fell 3.8 percent, heading for the
lowest close since Feb. 26. The stock was the biggest drag on
the benchmark measure.  PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI)  dropped 1.8 percent, poised for
the lowest close since Feb. 8. National carrier PT Garuda
Indonesia fell 1.9 percent. Auto distributor PT Astra
International, the largest company in the index by market
capitalization, lost 1.5 percent, heading for its lowest close
since Aug. 31, 2012.  The benchmark index is trading at 13.9 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with 15.9 times at its peak last month.
Trading volume was 17 percent higher than the 30-day average for
this time of day. The measure’s  30-day volatility  index, a
measure of price swings, was at 20.2, the highest level in 11
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
