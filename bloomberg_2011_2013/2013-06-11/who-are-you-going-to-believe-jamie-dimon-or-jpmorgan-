Jamie Dimon gave a heck of a quote today.  Speaking about the London Whale episode at a conference sponsored by Morgan Stanley, the chairman and chief executive officer of  JPMorgan Chase & Co .  said : “There was no hiding, there was no lying, there was no bulls----ing, period. But we were wrong about stuff.” He added: “Nothing was done that was deliberate in any way, shape or form."  For those who may have forgotten, the London Whale trades resulted in more than $6.2 billion of losses last year at the bank’s chief investment office and triggered government investigations. What’s striking about Dimon's quote, aside from its broad, categorical sweep, is that it seems to be inconsistent with some of JPMorgan’s own past statements.  Consider what the bank said in a July 2012  filing  with the Securities and Exchange Commission when it disclosed that it would restate its financial results for the first quarter of the year. As JPMorgan explained at the time, the restatement was necessary, in part, because the bank had found evidence that some traders may not have been truthful about the valuations they were using:  JPMorgan reiterated those findings in greater detail in January, when it released its own  internal report  about the trading losses. Here's an excerpt: It would seem that a clarification is in order.  (Jonathan Weil is a columnist for Bloomberg View. Follow him on Twitter.)
