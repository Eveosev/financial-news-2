Malaysia’s ringgit was headed for
its biggest two-day decline since May 2008 and  government bonds 
dropped on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will reduce monetary
stimulus, slowing inflows to emerging-market assets.  The currency reached its weakest level in almost a year as
DBS Bank Ltd. lowered the Southeast Asian nation’s 2013 economic
growth forecast to 5 percent from 5.5 percent, after factory
output and export data from China, Malaysia’s second-biggest
overseas market, trailed estimates. A U.S. jobs report on June 7
topped economists’ predictions, bolstering the case for the Fed
to trim its $85 billion monthly debt purchases.  “There is continuous speculation on the time and pace of
tapering of quantitative easing,” said Choong Yin Pheng, a
senior manager for fixed income and economic research at Hong
Leong Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “That has pared demand for
risk assets and affected the ringgit.”  The currency declined 1 percent to 3.1592 per dollar as of
4:02 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 3.1615, the weakest level since July 27,
after falling 1.1 percent yesterday.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 59 basis points,
or 0.59 percentage point, to 9.54 percent. The gauge touched
9.61 percent, the highest since Jan. 30, 2012.  Bond Outflows  A “modest adjustment downward” in bond buying is possible
as “early as this summer,” San Francisco Fed President  John
Williams  said last week. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has signaled
stimulus measures could be trimmed if there’s a “sustainable
improvement” in the jobs market.  Malaysia’s factory output rebounded in April, a government
report showed today. Industrial production gained 4.7 percent
from a year earlier, beating the 1.6 percent increase forecast
by economists in a Bloomberg survey and following a 0.1 percent
contraction in March.  The yield on the 3.26 percent government bonds due March
2018 advanced two basis points to 3.22 percent after climbing
three basis points yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Investors pulled a record $12.5 billion from bond funds in
the week ended June 5, Citigroup Inc. reported June 7, citing
data from U.S. research firm EPFR Global.  To contact the reporter on this story:
