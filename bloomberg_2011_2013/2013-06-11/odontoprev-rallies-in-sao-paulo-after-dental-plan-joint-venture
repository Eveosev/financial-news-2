Odontoprev SA (ODPV3) , a Brazilian dental
benefits company, soared the most in three years after signing a
deal with  Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3)  and  BB Seguridade Participacoes SA (BBSE3) 
to create a joint venture to sell dental plans.  Odontoprev shares rose 4.1 percent to 10.03 reais at 1:25
p.m. in Sao Paulo after earlier surging as much as 9 percent in
the biggest intraday gain since October 2010. Banco do Brasil
declined 1.8 percent to 23.52 reais and BB Seguridade fell 1.2
percent to 17.74 reais. The benchmark  Ibovespa (IBOV)  retreated 2.2
percent.  Odontoprev will have a 25.01% stake in the new company,
which will be named Brasildental Operadora de Planos
Odontológicos SA, according to a regulatory filing from the
dental benefits company today. Banco do Brasil and its
subsidiary will hold the remaining 74.99%.  The press offices of Odontgoprev, Banco do Brasil and BB
Seguridade didn’t immediately respond to phone calls from
Bloomberg News seeking comment.  Odontoprev’s  profits  have trailed analysts estimates in six
of the past eight quarters, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Shares declined 6.6 percent this year, while the Ibovespa
dropped 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
