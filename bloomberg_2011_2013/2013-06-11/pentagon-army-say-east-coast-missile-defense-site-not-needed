The Pentagon and Army officials who
head missile defense agencies told a Senate committee chairman
that a missile interceptor site on the U.S. East Coast isn’t
needed to improve U.S. defenses against Iranian missiles.  “There is no validated military requirement to deploy an
East Coast missile-defense site,” Vice Admiral James Syring,
head of the  Missile Defense Agency , and his Army counterpart,
Lieutenant General Richard Formica, wrote Senate Armed Services
Committee Chairman  Carl Levin  of Michigan.  The U.S. has sites in Alaska and California. House
lawmakers have pushed for an East Coast site, saying it’s needed
to defend against a potential attack by  Iran . Senator Chuck
Schumer, a  New York  Democrat, has urged that interceptors be
located in his state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
