Electricity demand from July through
September in the U.S. will fall to the lowest seasonal level in
four years as milder weather crimps air-conditioner use.  Total power consumption in the lower-48 states will average
11.72 billion kilowatt-hours per day in the third quarter, the
least for this time of the year since 2009, the Energy
Information Administration said in its Short-Term Energy
Outlook, released today in  Washington . The 2013 outlook was
trimmed to 10.52 billion kilowatt-hours a day from 10.56 billion
estimated in May.  “The past three summers have been especially warm,” the
EIA, the statistical division of the Energy Department, said in
a summer outlook linked to the monthly report. “The milder
temperatures expected this summer should reduce the need for air
conditioning, leading to lower electricity usage nationwide.”  The average household electric bills from June through
August will decline 2.5 percent from a year earlier to $395, the
government estimated. Residential electricity usage will drop
4.6 percent to average 3,200 kilowatt hours per customer during
the period.  The number of cooling degree days this summer, a measure of
air conditioner use factoring in population, will drop 8.2
percent to 915 from a year earlier, the EIA said. The number is
1.8 percent lower than the average for the same months from 2003
through 2012.  The fuel cost to generate electricity, including natural
gas and coal, will climb 14 percent in 2013. “The effect on
residential rates is unlikely to be fully passed through to
customers for another year or more,” the EIA said.  The residential price of electricity from June through
August will increase 2.2 percent to 12.35 cents a kilowatt-hour.  Power plants  fueled by natural gas will account for 27.6
percent of the electricity produced in the U.S. in 2013, down
from 30.4 percent in 2012. Coal’s share will climb to 40.2
percent from 37.4 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
