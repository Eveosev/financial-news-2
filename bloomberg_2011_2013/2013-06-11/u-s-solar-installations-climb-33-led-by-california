Solar installations in the first
quarter increased 33 percent to account for almost half of all
new electric capacity installed in the U.S., according to a
trade-group report.  Installations grew to 723 megawatts from a year earlier
with utility-scale projects accounting for 317.7 megawatts of
additions, the Washington-based  Solar Energy Industries
Association  said today in a  statement . SEIA expects 5.3
gigawatts will be installed in 2013, topping last year’s 3.3
gigawatts.  Growth will be driven increasingly by solar installations
at homes and businesses, Shayle Kann, vice president of research
in  Boston  at GTM Research, which wrote the report with SEIA,
said in an interview. Residential installations grew 53 percent
in the quarter, Kann said.  “Residential growth has been pretty consistent, but I
think you’re going to see it become the most rapidly growing
market,” Kann said. “We have relatively bullish forecasts
through 2016.”  That pace has quickened with the increase in third-party
financing, like those offered by  Solarcity Corp. (SCTY)  and Sunrun
Inc., for home solar projects, reaching more than 80 percent in
states like Colorado and  California , the report found.  “Right now, financing remains the biggest bottleneck for
solar,” Kann said. An even newer business model, crowdfunding
of projects, may help financing even more projects.  The value of the U.S. solar market grew 34 percent to $11.5
billion at the end of 2012, up from $8.6 billion in 2011, SEIA
said in March. There is now 9.2 gigawatts of solar-energy
capacity in the U.S.  California was the top state with 408 megawatts installed
in the first quarter, followed by  New Jersey  at 76 megawatts and
 Hawaii  with 44 megawatts, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
