Luke Morahan was called into the
Wallabies squad for their rugby series against the British and
Irish Lions after winger Joe Tomane broke his toe in training.  Morahan, who scored a 70-meter solo try for the  Queensland
Reds  against the Lions three days ago, made his Test debut last
year against  Scotland . Tomane was today ruled out of the June 22
series opener against the combined team in Brisbane after scans
revealed a small toe fracture in his left foot, the Australian
Rugby Union said.  Tomane will stay with the squad and is expected to recover
in time to be available to play some part in the remainder of
the best-of-three series, the ARU said in an e-mailed statement.  The second Test is scheduled June 29 in  Melbourne  with the
series finale a week later in Sydney.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
