U.K. stocks  dropped for a second day
as the  Bank of Japan  left its stimulus measures unchanged and
government bond yields climbed amid speculation the  Federal
Reserve  is considering reductions in bond purchases.  Antofagasta Plc.,  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and Glencore Xstrata
Plc all slid more than 2 percent as metal prices fell in London.
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Prudential Plc (PRU)  led a selloff in financial
companies.  ICAP (IAP)  Plc and Man Group Plc also tumbled.  The FTSE 100 Index lost 60.37 points, or 0.9 percent, to
6,340.08 at the close in London, after earlier sinking 1.9
percent. The gauge has posted three consecutive weekly declines
amid concern the U.S. Fed will start to taper its bond-buying
program that had helped drive the index to its highest level
since 1999.  “When investors don’t get what they want from central
banks it prompts a bit of panic,” said Ian Williams, a market
strategist at Peel Hunt LLP in London. “Bond markets are really
driving equities at the moment. Anticipation of central banks
not being there as the buyer of the last resort means you are
starting to see a correction in yields.”  The FTSE All-Share Index lost 1 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 1.5 percent. The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Volatility
Index, a measure of options prices on the U.K. benchmark gauge,
rose 6.5 percent to 17.48 today.  BOJ Tools  U.K. stocks followed declines in Asian equities after the
BOJ today refrained from expanding its tools to rekindle
inflation and stoke growth. Policy makers stuck with an April
pledge to increase the monetary base by 60 trillion ($620
billion) to 70 trillion yen per year.  A gauge of U.K. mining companies dropped 2.4 percent,
falling for a second day as gold slid to a two-week low and
copper led base metals lower on the London Metal Exchange.  Antofagasta lost 2.9 percent to 884.5 pence, Anglo American
lost 3.5 percent to 1,371.5 pence and Glencore Xstrata slipped
3.8 percent to 302.5 pence.  Banks and insurers also declined in London as U.S.
treasuries tumbled on concern the biggest monthly surge in
yields since December will prompt investors to sell government
debt as a hedge against losses on mortgage bonds as borrowing
costs climb to a 14-month high.  HSBC, Europe’s largest bank and the heaviest stock on the
FTSE 100, lost 1 percent to 693.4 pence.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  dropped
1.3 percent to 304.55 pence, while Prudential, the U.K.’s
largest insurer, slumped 3.7 percent to 1,055 pence.  ICAP Sinks  ICAP retreated 3.6 percent to 359.9 pence after Credit
Suisse Group Plc lowered its recommendation for the world’s
largest broker of transactions between banks to underperform,
the equivalent of sell, citing a high level of uncertainty over
volume trends.  Man Group sank 7.1 percent to 86.25 pence. The world’s
largest publicly traded hedge-fund manager releases its weekly
assets under management figures after the close of trading. The
stock tumbled 18 percent last week after net assets of its
flagship AHL Diversified fund declined 6.1 percent.  Separately, bondholders agreed to sell  Man Group (EMG)  $141.4
million of its subordinated notes as part of a plan to cut debt.  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN)  and  Henderson Group Plc (HGG)  fell
4.4 percent to 395.8 pence, and 3.7 percent to 147.9 pence,
respectively.  Ocado Group Plc (OCDO)  rallied 4.2 percent to 325 pence, extending
a record high. The shares advanced as short sellers closed their
positions in the U.K.’s largest online grocer, according to
analysts including Exane BNP Paribas’s Andrew Gwynn.  Short Sellers  The company is the sixth-most-shorted stocks on the FTSE
250 Index with 7.8 percent of shares out on loan, according to
the most recent data from Markit. The short interest has come
down 25 percent in the past month to a one-year low as Ocado
unveiled a partnership with William Morrison Supermarkets Plc.  Keller Group Plc (KLR)  advanced 2.1 percent to 925 pence after
announcing plans to acquire Canadian foundations company North
American Piling for a maximum payment of C$320 million ($313
million). Jefferies Group said the acquisition would lead to an
11 percent upgrade of estimates for 2013 pretax earnings.  In Dublin,  Bank of Ireland (BKIR)  Plc dropped 7 percent to 15.9
euro cents, extending yesterday’s 5 percent selloff, after  Fitch
Ratings  warned that loan impairments at the biggest Irish lender
by assets and rival  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK)  may rise and the
lenders may need more capital. AIB also slid 7 percent to 6.6
cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
