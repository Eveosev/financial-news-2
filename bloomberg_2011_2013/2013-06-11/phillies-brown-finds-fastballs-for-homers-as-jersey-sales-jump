Domonic Brown is doing in June what
made him the National League’s Player of the Month for May.  Brown, the 25-year-old Philadelphia Phillies outfielder, is
fulfilling the expectations placed upon him as a top prospect,
leading the NL with 19 home runs after starting the season at
the major league level for the first time. He hit 12 in May, and
set a Major League Baseball record by accomplishing the feat
without drawing a walk the entire month. In 10 June games, he’s
added four more homers and is batting .351.  The left-handed hitter’s success comes from being more
aggressive at the plate and better at hitting fastballs, data
compiled by  Bloomberg Sports  shows.  “He’s starting to believe he belongs in the big leagues,”
said former Major League Baseball All-Star Sean Casey, now an
analyst for  MLB Network . “That’s the biggest thing.”  Brown’s blossoming at the plate has helped increase the
Phillies’ television ratings and jersey sales as well as
attendance at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. Giving him
time to succeed after being drafted seven years ago has paid off
for him and his ballclub.  Brown made his major league debut in July 2010, playing 35
games and hitting .210. He also had 56-game stints with the
Phillies in 2011 and 2012, each season hitting five home runs.  Data compiled by Bloomberg shows he’d swung at 53.9 percent
of pitches in 146 plate appearances from May 1 to June 10,
hitting 16 homers and batting .324. His swing percentage was
46.6 percent during 589 plate appearances from his July 2010
debut to April 30, when he batted .235 with 15 homers.  “I know he didn’t have any walks, but that aggressive
mentality will also help him learn the strike zone, what he
can’t handle, what he can handle,” Casey said in a telephone
interview.  Finding Fastballs  Having worked to shorten his swing, he’s also hit fastballs
better, batting .439 on them from May 1 to June 10 and .232
during the prior period. He has eight homers against fastballs
since May 1 and eight against off-speed pitches.  Brown’s slugging percentage is .784 in June, compared to
.688 in May. He has four walks and seven strikeouts this month.  While his strikeout percentage has remained about the same
at 18.5 since May 1, Brown’s walk percentage has dipped to 2.7
from 10.2 during his career before May 1.  The Phillies, 31-34, were averaging 36,653 fans per home
game at the end of April. They’re now at 38,277 per game, a 4.4
percent increase.  Brown, a 20th-round 2006 draft pick who’s making $500,000
this season, ranked 15th among outfielders in balloting for the
NL All-Star team as of last week. The Phillies met yesterday to
discuss how to get him more All-Star votes, spokeswoman Bonnie
Clark said in an e-mail. With promotional giveaways decided
before the season, the team does not have any planned around
Brown for 2013.  Jersey Sales  Sales of Brown’s No. 9 jersey over the last seven days have
increased more than 350 percent from the previous week on
 Fanatics.com , one of the largest online retailers of officially
licensed sports merchandise, according to the company, which
doesn’t provide specific figures.  Phillies television ratings on  Comcast SportsNet , the
team’s flagship station, are up 22 percent this month over May.  Casey, a three-time All-Star who played 12 major league
seasons, including eight for the  Cincinnati Reds , had his best
month in September 2000, batting .378 with 10 homers and 32
RBIs.  “When you are in those hot streaks you just appreciate
them because they’re few and far between,” Casey said. “When
you’re having success you cannot wait to get to the plate, you
can’t wait to see a pitch and hammer something.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
