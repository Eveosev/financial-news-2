Canadian stocks  fell, sending the
benchmark equity gauge to its lowest since April, as commodities
producers plunged after Bank of  Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda
left a stimulus program unchanged.  Energy and raw-materials stocks slumped the most out of  10
groups (SPTSX)  in the Standard & Poorâ€™s/TSX Composite Index amid
investor concern central banks will reduce or refrain from
expanding stimulus measures. Lululemon Athletica Inc. tumbled 16
percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange after announcing that
Chief Executive Officer Christine Day will leave. Kinross Gold
Corp. lost 4.5 percent after deciding to stop developing a
mining project in Ecuador.  The S&P/TSX declined 1 percent to 12,256.16. The benchmark
gauge for Canadian equities has fallen in seven of the last
eight trading days. Volume was in line with the 30-day average
at this time of day.  BOJ policy makers refrained from expanding their tools to
address bond-market volatility. The central bank left its one-year fixed-rate loan facility unaltered and Governor Haruhiko
Kuroda said the BOJ will consider longer funding operations if
they become necessary.  Commodities fell for the second consecutive day, led by
metals. Aluminum dropped 1.6 percent and copper declined 1.5
percent. Brent crude slipped 2 percent to $101.91 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
