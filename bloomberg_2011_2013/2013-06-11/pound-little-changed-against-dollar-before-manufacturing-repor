U.K. government bonds fell for a
fourth day, pushing 10-year yields to the highest level in
almost four months, as demand dropped at a 3.75 billion-pound
($5.84 billion) sale of new benchmark securities.  Two-year gilt yields climbed above 0.5 percent for the
first time since April 2012 as a government report showed
industrial production rose in April. Gilts have  underperformed 
German bunds every day since June 4, when industry data showed
the U.K.’s construction industry unexpectedly expanded last
month. Investors bid for 1.52 times the amount of 10-year bonds
sold today, down from a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.68 on April 9.
The pound was little changed.  “The sale was marginally disappointing,” said Robin Marshall, a director of fixed income in London at Smith &
Williamson Investment Management, which oversees about $22
billion. “The cover wasn’t fantastic. I wouldn’t be hurrying in
to buy it, but we’re getting back into the buying zone” in
terms of yield, he said.  The yield on the current benchmark 1.75 percent gilt
maturing in September 2022 climbed three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.17 percent at the 5 p.m. close of trading
in  London  after rising to 2.24 percent, the highest level since
Feb. 14. The price fell 0.25, or 2.50 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 96.47.  The  two-year yield  increased four basis points to 0.47
percent after reaching 0.51 percent, the most since March 2012.  Short Sterling  The difference between yields on short-sterling futures due
in March 2014 and March 2015, a measure of future interest-rate
expectations, widened seven basis points to 39 basis points, the
most since April 2012 based on closing prices.  The U.K. Debt Management Office sold the 2.25 percent bonds
maturing in September 2023 at an average yield of 2.365 percent,
compared with 1.734 percent at the previous auction of similar-maturity debt on April 9.  “Ten-year yields were under pressure after today’s gilt
auction,” Annalisa Piazza, an analyst at Newedge Group in
London, wrote in a note to clients. “The auction attracted less
interest than anticipated.”  The U.K. is scheduled to sell 2.25 billion pounds of gilts
due in June 2032 on June 13.  Industrial production rose 0.1 percent from March, the
London-based Statistics Office said. The median forecast of 28
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for no change.
 Manufacturing (UKMPIMOM)  production shrank 0.2 percent from the previous
month when it expanded 1.1 percent.  Spread Widens  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
instead of similar-maturity German bunds has widened five basis
points this week to 57 basis points.  The  Bank of England  voted last week to keep its program of
asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, unchanged at 375
billion pounds.  “The strength of the U.K. data means were are unlikely to
see any more QE any time soon, which explains gilts’
underperformance,” said Simon Peck, a rates strategist at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.9 percent this year
through yesterday, according to the Bloomberg U.K. Sovereign
Bond Index. German bonds dropped 1.2 percent and  U.S. Treasuries 
declined 1.4 percent, separate Bloomberg indexes show.  The pound traded at $1.5585 after falling as much as 0.3
percent. The currency fell 0.1 percent to 85.10 pence per euro.  Sterling has gained 5.7 percent during the past three
months, the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
gained 0.7 percent and the euro appreciated 2.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
