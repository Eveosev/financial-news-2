Philippine  stocks  slumped, heading
for the biggest loss since September 2011, after the nation’s
unemployment rate climbed to a three-year high and exports
contracted more than expected.  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  slumped 4.6 percent to
6,556.65 at the close in Manila, ending a three-day rally. The
measure’s 30-day volatility  climbed  to 27.9, the highest since
November 2011, and valuations dropped to a four-month low.
Unemployment increased to 7.5 percent in the three months
through April, the highest since the quarter ended June 2010,
the National Statistics Office said today. Exports shrank 12.8
percent in April, the office said, exceeding the 5.3 percent
median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  “The high unemployment rate casts a shadow of doubt on the
strength of economic growth and its sustainability,”  Jonathan Ravelas , chief market strategist at Manila-based BDO Unibank
Inc. “Whether the perception is right or wrong, it raises
questions. The exports data highlights the world economy remains
fragile.”  The jobless rate increased even after the government
reported on May 30 gross domestic product expanded 7.8 percent
in the three months ended March, the fastest pace in almost
three years. The economy will grow 6 percent to 7 percent this
year, according to official forecasts.  Stimulus Concerns  Ayala Land Inc. (ALI) , the largest property developer, sank 6.5
percent, the biggest contributor to the benchmark index’s
decline.  Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (TEL) , the nation’s
biggest phone company, lost 4.2 percent, the most since Jan. 26,
2012.  SM Investments Corp. (SMPH) , owner of the nation’s biggest mall
developer and the largest department store and grocery store
operators, plunged 5.5 percent, the largest decline since April
3, 2012. International Container Terminal Services Inc., the
nation’s biggest port operator, slumped 3.3 percent.  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index has retreated 11
percent since closing at a record 7,392.20 on May 15. The
benchmark gauge has tumbled since U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke’s comment on May 22 that policy makers could
consider reducing the pace of monetary stimulus triggered a
selloff by overseas investors.  Still, the measure has gained 13 percent this year, heading
for a fifth annual advance, boosted by better-than-expected
economic growth, low interest rates and as the nation won two
upgrades in sovereign debt rating to investment grade.  The index is trading at 18.3 times projected 12-month
earnings, the cheapest since Feb. 4, compared with a record 20.8
multiple reached on May 15.  Overseas funds have sold a net of $70.9 million of
Philippine equities since May 22, paring this year’s net
purchases to $1.52 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
