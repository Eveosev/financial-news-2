The Canadian dollar dropped for the
first time in four days versus its U.S. counterpart as prices on
crude oil, the country’s largest export, fell the most in a week
along with other commodities.  The currency fell against the majority of its most traded
peers as futures on crude oil dropped as much as 1.3 percent to
$94.50 per barrel in  New York  before a report forecast to show
stockpiles increased last week in the U.S., the largest customer
of Canadian oil. Crude inventories probably rose by 550,000
barrels to 391.8 million last week, and U.S. gasoline supplies
by  500,000 barrels  to 219.3 million, according to a Bloomberg
News survey before the report tomorrow from the Energy
Information Administration.  “The Canadian dollar remains a high-beta currency, and
fluctuations in the oil price will always affect it more,” said
Eimear Daly, a currency market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd., by
phone from  London .  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known, fell 0.5
percent to C$1.0248 per  U.S. dollar  at 8:19 a.m. in Toronto. One
loonie buys 97.58 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
