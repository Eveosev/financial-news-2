European stocks retreated for a
second day as the  Bank of Japan  refrained from expanding
stimulus and Treasuries sank amid speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will trim bond purchases.  Legrand SA (LR)  retreated 4.1 percent after Wendel sold the
remaining 14.4 million shares it holds in the world’s largest
maker of switches, plugs and lighting controls. ICAP Plc dropped
3.6 percent after Credit Suisse Group AG recommended selling the
shares. BHP Billiton Ltd. led a  gauge of mining companies  to the
lowest level since 2009 as copper dropped for a fourth day. DNO
International ASA surged to a five-year high.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 1.2 percent to 291.74 at
the close of trading, as  Germany ’s top court began hearings on
the  European Central Bank ’s Outright Monetary Transactions
program. The benchmark gauge earlier sank as much as 2.1
percent, reaching a seven-week low. The measure has retreated
6.1 percent since May 22 amid growing speculation the Fed will
taper its stimulus measures as the  U.S. economy  strengthens.  “There is a big amount of uncertainty in the market,”
said Peter Buergler, a trader at Luzerner Kantonalbank AG in
Lucerne,  Switzerland . “Some of it is still connected to the
fear of stimulus being reduced by the Federal Reserve, and some
of it is connected to the federal court hearings in Germany. The
BOJ also disappointed today. All of this is a bit too much for
market participants, so they are taking a step back.”  The benchmark 10-year U.S.  Treasury yield  climbed as much
as eight basis points to 2.29 percent, the highest level since
April 2012, before retracing some gains. Investors should get
used to yields being closer to 4 percent than 2 percent, former
Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman  Jim O’Neill  said in a
Bloomberg Television interview.  Benchmark Indexes  National benchmark indexes dropped in all 18 western
European markets today.  France ’s CAC 40 lost 1.4 percent while
Germany’s DAX declined 1 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell
0.9 percent.  Greece ’s  ASE (ASE)  sank 4.7 percent for the biggest two-day slide
in a year. The gauge also tumbled 4.7 percent yesterday as
Greece failed to secure any bids for the Depa SA gas monopoly,
marking the latest setback to a state-asset sales program that
underpins 240 billion euros ($318 billion) of foreign aid.  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies
was 18 percent greater than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The VStoxx Index, a
gauge of options prices hedging against moves in the Euro Stoxx
50 Index climbed 7.2 percent to 21.01.  BOJ Tools  The BOJ today refrained from expanding its tools to
rekindle inflation and stoke growth, sticking with an April
pledge to increase the monetary base by 60 trillion yen ($620
billion) to 70 trillion yen a year.  “Uncertainty weighs on markets today,” said Eric Bernhardt, chief investment officer at Umblin AG in Zurich.
“Investors are disappointed by the BOJ’s unchanged policy as
they had hoped they would do more to solve the problems on the
Japanese  bond market .”  Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court began a two-day
hearing to address the ECB’s OMT program, which was introduced
last year as concerns peaked that the euro region would break
apart. The as-yet-unused OMT foresees potentially unlimited
purchases of bonds of debt-stricken countries that sign up to
adjustment programs.  Legrand fell 4.1 percent to 35.59 euros. Wendel, France’s
biggest publicly traded investment firm, offered the remaining
shares it holds at 36 euros apiece. The company said it made a
capital gain of about 370 million euros. Wendel lost 1.5 percent
to 83.92 euros.  ICAP Downgrade  ICAP (IAP)  dropped 3.6 percent to 359.9 pence, its biggest
decline in two months, after Credit Suisse cut the world’s
largest broker of transactions between banks to underperform
from neutral, meaning investors should sell the shares, citing a
high level of uncertainty over volume trends.  Bank of Ireland Plc, the biggest Irish lender by assets,
retreated 7 percent to 15.9 euro cents, the largest slump in
almost three months. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. yesterday cut its
rating on the shares to sell from neutral.  Financial stocks declined, with  Man Group Plc (EMG)  sliding 7.1
percent to 86.25 pence, the lowest price in five months.
National Bank of Greece SA lost 4.1 percent to 3.99 euros and
Aberdeen Asset Management Plc fell 4.4 percent to 395.8 pence.  A gauge of European miners was the  worst performer  of the
19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600, with  BHP Billiton  and Anglo
American Plc sliding 1.6 percent to 1,778.5 pence and 3.5
percent to 1,371.5 pence, respectively. Fresnillo Plc lost 3.8
percent to 1,076 pence. Copper for delivery in three months sank
as much as 1.8 percent to $7,032 a metric ton in  London .  Fonciere Falls  Fonciere des Regions  slipped 3 percent to 60.54 euros after
saying it will spend close to 1 billion euros to lift its stake
in Fonciere Developpement Logements to between 58.2 percent and
62.4 percent and increase its presence in Germany. Fonciere
Developpement rose 6.9 percent to 18 euros.  DNO rose 10 percent to 11.30 kroner, the highest price
since June 2008. The oil producer focused on the Kurdistan
region of northern  Iraq  said it may increase its production
target after a discovery at the region’s Tawke field and a
successful test of another well.  To contact the reporter on this story:
