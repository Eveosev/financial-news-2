The cost of shipping  iron ore 
rallied the most in more than a month amid speculation that a
slowdown in record fleet growth is helping owners to negotiate
better charters.  Rates for Capesizes transporting 150,000 metric tons or
more of the steelmaking commodity rose 4.1 percent to $5,797 a
day, the largest one-day advance since May 7, according to the
 Baltic Exchange  in London. The Baltic Dry Index, a wider measure
of freight prices, gained 1.2 percent to 825 points.  The fleet of Capesizes more than doubled between 2008 and
last year after owners ordered more of the vessels than ever,
according to data from  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the world’s largest
shipbroker. The growth rate will slow to 6 percent in 2013,
about the same pace as demand for commodities including coal,
iron ore and grains, according to the London-based firm.  “We are finally seeing low fleet growth,”  Jeffrey Landsberg , managing director of Commodore Research, a New York-based adviser to ship owners, said by phone. “As the months
progress, I think we will see even more of an effect, in a
positive way.”  While holidays in  China  are curbing demand for vessels,
bookings from outside the Asian country are gaining, he said.
Rates for Capesizes are still below $7,758 a day, the amount
owners need to cover operating expenses including crew and
repairs, according to the most recent estimates from Moore
Stephens LLP, a London-based consultant.  Three out of four vessel classes tracked by the Baltic
Exchange gained. Panamaxes, with about half the capacity of
Capesizes, rose 1.4 percent to $6,179 a day. Supramaxes,
transporting about 52,000 tons, advanced 0.2 percent to $9,326.
The only type to decline was Handysizes, the smallest. Rates for
those fell $1 to $7,764 a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
