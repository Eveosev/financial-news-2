Crude oil options volatility was
little changed as the underlying futures gained for the first
time in three days.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 20.07 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 2:35 p.m., compared with 20.15 percent
yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery rose 50
cents to settle at $96.10 a barrel on the Nymex. July futures
gained 50 cents to $95.88.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
September $85 puts, which fell 2 cents to 62 cents a barrel on
10,694 lots at 2:40 p.m. on the Nymex. July $100 calls were the
second-most active, holding at 3 cents a barrel on volume of
3,238 contracts.  Puts accounted for 58 percent of electronic trading volume
today. In the prior session, bearish bets accounted for 54
percent of 127,079 contracts.  July $94 puts were the most-active options traded
yesterday, with 7,109 contracts changing hands. They rose 5
cents to 50 cents a barrel. July $98 calls declined 9 cents to
14 cents on volume of 6,561 lots.  Open interest was highest for September $85 puts with
42,418 contracts. Next were December $105 calls with 37,676 lots
and July $110 calls with 36,683.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
