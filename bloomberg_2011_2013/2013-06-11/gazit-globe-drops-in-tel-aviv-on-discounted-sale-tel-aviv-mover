Gazit-Globe Ltd. (GZT)  dropped the most in
more than two months after the multinational real estate company
held a share tender for institutional investors at a discount to
yesterday’s closing price.  The  stock  of the Tel Aviv-based company dropped 4 percent,
the most since April 9, to 48.86 shekels at 2:48 p.m. in Tel
Aviv, in 4.4 times the three-month average daily volume. The
benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  slid 0.8 percent.  The company will offer 250 million shekels ($68 million) to
institutional investors today, Clal Finance Underwritings Ltd.
and Leader Underwriters (1993) Ltd. said in an e-mailed report
today. The tender’s minimum price is 49.50 shekels a share, the
underwriters said, a 2.8% discount to yesterday’s closing price.
Gazit-Globe said yesterday after markets closed it’s considering
a public share offering. A Gazit official, who asked not to be
identified citing company policy, confirmed the tender would be
held today.  “The company raises equity every year or two to maintain
its leverage level in light of the 3 to 4 billion shekels it
makes in new investments every year,” Noam Pincu, an analyst at
Psagot Investment House Ltd., said today by phone from  Tel Aviv .
The shares are down because the offering is at a discount, he
said. Pincu has a price estimate 59 shekels on the shares and
 recommends  investors buy the stock, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Gazit, which spent 264 million shekels in the first quarter
of the year for the acquisition of two income-producing
properties and invested 365 million shekels in the development
and expansion of projects, has  $10 billion  in long-term
obligations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net debt
to total assets was 55.6 percent, as of March 31, compared with
56.1%, as of December 31, 2012, and 57.8% as of March 31, 2012,
the company said on May 28.  Gazit has commercial and retail real estate in more than 20
countries including the U.S. and  Brazil . Shares of Norstar
Holdings, which  owns a 54 percent  stake in Gazit according to
data compiled by Bloomberg, fell 5.7 percent, the most since
July 25, to 100.2 shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
