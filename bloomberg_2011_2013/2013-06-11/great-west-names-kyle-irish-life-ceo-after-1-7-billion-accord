Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO) , Canada’s
second-largest insurer, named Bill Kyle chief executive officer
of  Irish Life  Group Ltd., which the company is set to take over
for 1.3 billion euros ($1.7 billion) within weeks.  Kyle, who has worked for Great-West and its subsidiaries
for 34 years, will succeed Irish Life CEO  Kevin Murphy , who will
retire at the end of this month after 42 years with the company,
Dublin-based Irish Life said in a statement. Murphy, 61, had
postponed his planned retirement at the end of last year.  Ireland’s government agreed to sell the nation’s largest
life and pensions company to Winnipeg, Manitoba-based Great-West
in February to cut its gross 64 billion-euro bill for saving its
financial system. Finance Minister Michael Noonan’s officials
re-opened talks with Great-West last year after abandoning them
in November 2011 amid concerns that the euro-area debt crisis
would increase the costs, two people with knowledge of the
matter said last December.  Kyle, executive vice president of wealth management at
Great-West, led the group’s retirement business over the past
two decades, during which its assets rose to C$35 billion ($34.2
billion) from C$3 billion, Irish Life said.  The Great-West agreement is the “first time during this
crisis that a company in which we have invested has been
returned fully to private ownership,” Irish Finance Minister
 Michael Noonan  said in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
