Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , the
Chinese solar-cell maker whose main unit was pulled into 
bankruptcy proceedings in March, was sued by investors seeking 
$550,000 due on securities.  Trondheim Capital Partners LP and Michael Meixler filed the
suit in New York State Supreme Court in  Manhattan  yesterday.
They’re requesting a pretrial ruling ordering Wuxi, China-based
Suntech to pay $550,000 in principal due on 3 percent 2013
convertible senior notes, plus interest, costs, expenses and
legal fees, according to court filings.  Suntech defaulted on March 15 on its obligation to repay
$575 million to holders of the notes, which were issued in March
2008 pursuant to a prospectus and registration  statement  filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a
statement from attorneys for the plaintiffs.  Suntech defaulted in March on $541 million of bonds, and
eight Chinese banks later that month filed a petition for
insolvency and restructuring of the company’s main solar
manufacturing unit, Suntech said in a statement on March 20.
Suntech said it wouldn’t object to the filing in Wuxi Municipal
Intermediate People’s Court.  Suntech’s investor relations department didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuit.  Forbearance Agreement  Other noteholders have entered into a forbearance agreement
and Gilbert, Arizona-based Trondheim and Meixler, who is based
in Show Low,  Arizona , sued to protect their rights, said Jay
Teitelbaum, an attorney for the plaintiffs.  “They are small holders, obviously,” Teitelbaum said in a
phone interview. “They feel like they’re just going to get
trampled if they don’t exercise their rights.”  Shi Zhengrong founded Suntech in 2002 and took the company
public three years later, becoming one of the world’s first
solar billionaires. Backed by government loans, the company more
than quadrupled its panel-production capacity to 2,400 megawatts
a year from 2007 to 2011, dominating the industry.  The case is Trondheim Capital Partners LP v. Suntech Power
Holdings Co. Ltd., 652060/2013,  New York  State Supreme Court,
New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
