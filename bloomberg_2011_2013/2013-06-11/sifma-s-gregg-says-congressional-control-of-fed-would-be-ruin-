Judd Gregg, the new chief executive
officer of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association, said congressional control over the Federal Reserve
would lead to “economic ruin.”  Gregg, a former U.S. senator, is concerned about the
perception that “the Federal Reserve is in some way a threat to
the underpinnings of the American prosperity” and the notion
that Congress should take control of the Federal Open Market
Committee, he said today during an interview.  “The idea that Congress would have any influence at all
over the money supply is the fastest road we could take to
economic ruin,” Gregg, 66, said at Bloomberg News headquarters
in New York.  Gregg was named CEO of Sifma, Wall Street’s largest lobby
group, on May 20, replacing Tim Ryan, who left for  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  this year. The New Hampshire Republican retired from
the Senate in 2011, and has also been an adviser to New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
