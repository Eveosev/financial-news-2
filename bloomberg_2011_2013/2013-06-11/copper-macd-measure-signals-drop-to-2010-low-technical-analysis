Copper futures in  New York  are
poised to reach the lowest price since mid-2010 in the next two
months, according to  technical analysis  from Paul Kavanaugh at
FuturePath Trading LLC.  The moving average convergence-divergence graph, or MACD,
shows the 26-week and 12-week moving averages traded below a
nine-week measure known as the signal line since June 7. The
crossover is a bearish sign, Kavanaugh said. Copper futures
touched $3.173 a pound yesterday, the lowest since May 3, and
may soon test last month’s low of $304.25 and reach $2.85 by the
end of August, which would be the lowest since June 10, 2010,
according to Kavanaugh.  “The chart is looking bearish on copper for the medium
term, and new lows are likely,” Kavanaugh, a futures and
options specialist at FuturePath in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “We would expect to see continued selling
pressure.”  Copper has lost 13 percent this year on the Comex amid
signs of slowing growth in China and concern that central banks
including the  Federal Reserve  will start to reduce the pace of
stimulus.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
