Marketed natural-gas production in
the U.S. this year will top 70 billion cubic feet a day for the
first time amid gains from onshore reserves and higher prices, a
government report showed.  Daily output will average 70.01 billion cubic feet, up from
69.9 billion estimated in May, the Energy Information
Administration said in its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook ,
released today in  Washington . Production will set a record for
the sixth straight year as new wells come online at shale
formations, such as the Marcellus in the Northeast and the
Bakken in North Dakota, government data show.  Gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana,
will average $3.92 per million British thermal units, up from
the May estimate of $3.80, according to the report from the EIA,
the Energy Department’s statistical arm. The average for third
quarter was raised 7.4 percent to $4.05 from $3.77.  Colder winters in 2013 and 2014 compared with unusually
warm weather in 2012 are “expected to increase the amount of
natural gas used for residential and commercial space heating,”
the EIA said. Onshore production will increase this year and in
2014 while federal Gulf of  Mexico  output drops.  Gas inventories at the end of October will total 3.813
trillion cubic feet, revised higher from 3.796 trillion
estimated last month, according to the report. Supplies rose to
a record 3.929 trillion last November.  Lower 48  Production in the lower 48 states will average 64.96
billion cubic feet a day, up from last month’s estimate of 64.77
billion. The forecast for total gas consumption fell to 70.04
70.17 billion cubic feet a day from 70.17 billion.  The U.S. is exporting a record amount of gas by pipeline to
Mexico, which is seeing its usage of the fuel rising faster than
domestic production, the EIA said.  Daily exports from the U.S.
jumped almost 29 percent to average 1.6 billion cubic feet a day
this year as of May 6 from a year earlier, government data show.  An above-normal hurricane season this year may curtail
production in the Gulf of Mexico by 46 billion cubic feet,
compared with 32.1 billion last year, according to the report.
Gulf output in 2013 will average 4.14 billion cubic feet a day.  “The growing share of total production from inland areas
has reduced the vulnerability of overall U.S. oil and natural
gas supply to hurricanes,” the EIA said.  Demand for gas from power plants will average 22.49 billion
cubic feet a day this year, lower than the previous estimate of
22.78 billion. The estimate for daily industrial use rose to
19.88 billion cubic feet from 19.79 billion in May’s report.  Natural gas for July delivery fell 4.6 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $3.754 per million Btu at 1:43 p.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Prices have gained 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
