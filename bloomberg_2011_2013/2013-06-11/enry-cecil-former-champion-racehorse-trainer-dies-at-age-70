Racehorse trainer Henry Cecil,
winner of 25 British Classics, has died at age 70.  Cecil, who was British champion trainer 10 times, had been
having treatment for cancer.  “It is with great sadness that Warren Place Stables
confirms the passing of Sir Henry Cecil earlier this morning,”
his official website said.  Cecil, knighted by the Queen in 2011, enjoyed some of his
greatest success in recent years with Frankel, the world’s top-ranked horse. He won the Champions Stakes at Ascot in October to
end his racing career with victories in all of his 14 races.  The Newmarket-based trainer had a record 75 wins at Royal
Ascot, whose 2013 edition takes place next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
