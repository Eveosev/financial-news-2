Japanese  government bonds  declined,
sending benchmark yields to a more than one-week high, after the
nation’s central bank refrained from expanding operations to
stem volatility in debt markets.  Benchmark  yields  climbed after the  Bank of Japan 
disappointed some investors who had speculated that it would
extend the maturity of a one-year, fixed-rate loan facility to
banks. The central bank stuck with an April pledge to increase
the monetary base by 60 trillion yen ($611 billion) to 70
trillion yen per year.  “It looks like the  bond market  expected the BOJ to extend
the loan term to more than two years, so no decision on that
will give upward pressure on medium-term  yields ,” said  Takafumi Yamawaki , the Tokyo-based chief rates strategist at JPMorgan
Chase & Co., one of the 24 primary dealers obliged to bid at
government debt auctions. “There’s a bit of disappointment.”  Japan ’s 10-year yields increased 5 1/2 basis points to 0.88
percent, the highest since May 31, as of 5:01 p.m. in Tokyo,
according to Japan Bond Trading Co. The price of the 0.8 percent
note due in June 2023 fell 0.505 yen, or 505 yen per 100,000 yen
face amount, to 99.264 yen. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  Yields have swung from an all-time low of 0.315 percent to
as much as 1 percent since the BOJ announced on April 4 that it
would double monthly bond purchases to more than 7 trillion yen.  Ten-year bond futures for September delivery slid 0.39 to
142.57 in  Tokyo . The Topix index of shares declined 1 percent as
the yen strengthened 0.6 percent to 98.22 per dollar.  Twenty of 23 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey forecast
that the BOJ would approve loans of two years or longer, or said
that such a move was possible today.  The central bank will discuss longer funding operations if
they become necessary, Kuroda told reporters today. The BOJ will
conduct bond operations to lower volatility, he said.  Japanese government bonds have gained 0.7 percent this year
through yesterday, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
