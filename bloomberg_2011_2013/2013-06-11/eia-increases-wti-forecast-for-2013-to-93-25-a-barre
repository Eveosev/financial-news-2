The U.S. Energy Information
Administration  increased its crude-oil price forecast for 2013
as heating demand boosted consumption of distillates and
liquefied petroleum gas.  West Texas Intermediate oil will average  $93.25 a barrel 
this year, up 8 cents from the May projection of $93.17, the
EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said today in its
monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. The U.S. benchmark grade will
fall to $91.96 in 2014. Total liquid fuels consumption rose
180,000 barrels a day in the first quarter from a year earlier,
the EIA said.  “Much of that increase was due to weather, with heating
degree days in the Northeast 21 percent higher than the mild
first quarter seen last year,” the EIA said in the report.  WTI crude for July delivery fell 85 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $94.92 a barrel at 12:20 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The U.S. grade dropped 1.6 percent to $91.97 in May.
Brent oil declined $1.45, or 1.4 percent, to $102.50 on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The North Sea crude
tumbled 1.9 percent last month.  The EIA forecast that Brent, the benchmark grade for more
than half the world’s crude, will average $104.65 a barrel in
2013, down from last month’s prediction of $105.89. The average
cost of domestic and imported grades used by U.S. refiners will
be $98.48 a barrel this year, up from the May projection of
$98.12, and $96.68 next year, down from $96.99. Brent will drop
to $99.75 a barrel in 2014, down from $100.75.  Non-OPEC Output  Oil production outside of OPEC will rise 1.19 million
barrels a day from 2012 to 53.91 million in 2013, led by gains
in the U.S. and  Canada . The 2013 output projection was increased
from 53.85 million in May.  U.S. crude production is projected to climb to 7.29 million
barrels a day from 6.5 million in 2012, a decrease from last
month’s projection of 7.42 million. Output will rise to 8.09
million next year.  “Drilling in tight oil plays in the onshore Williston,
Western Gulf and Permian Basins is expected to account for the
bulk of forecast production growth over the next two years,”
the EIA said in the report.  U.S. oil consumption will average 18.64 million barrels a
day in 2013, up from last month’s forecast of 18.63 million.
Next year demand is projected to slip to 18.63 million,
unchanged from the May report.  The EIA raised  its forecast  for global oil consumption this
year to 90.03 million barrels a day from 89.93 million last
month. Demand will climb to 91.22 million barrels a day in 2014,
up from the May estimate of 91.14 million.  OECD Consumption  Demand from the 30 members of the  Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development  will average 45.46 million barrels a
day this year, down from 45.95 million last year. The forecast
was cut from 45.47 million last month. The forecast for 2014 is
45.25 million.  The OECD doesn’t include  developing countries  such as
China, India and  Brazil . The EIA raised its forecast of
consumption by non-OECD countries to 44.57 million barrels a
day, up from last month’s projection of 44.46 million. That
would be a 3.1 percent gain from 43.22 million in 2012. Demand
will rise to 45.97 million in next year, the report showed.  “In April 2013, estimated total liquids fuels consumption
in non-OECD countries reached 44.5 million barrels per day,
which was higher than consumption in OECD countries (44.3
million barrels per day) for the first time in history,” the
EIA said. “On an average annual basis, non-OECD use of liquid
fuels is forecast to exceed OECD levels in 2014.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
