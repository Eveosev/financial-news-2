Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  unveiled software that knits together technology from its data-analysis acquisitions, and announced a personal computer deal with Google Inc. as it seeks to boost sales to business customers and counter slumping demand for personal computers.  The analysis product, called Haven, combines capabilities from the  acquisitions  of Autonomy Corp., Vertica Systems Inc. and ArcSight LLC to help customers mine vast amounts of information, the  Palo Alto , California-based PC maker said in a statement today. The company also said its resellers would deliver Hewlett-Packard PCs and printers bundled together with Google’s business e-mail, word processing and calendar tools.  Chief Executive Officer  Meg Whitman  is seeking to extract value from deals that were agreed upon before she became chief executive officer almost two years ago. Hewlett-Packard found accounting improprieties at Autonomy last year that led to writedowns and investigations.  “We have stabilized our business,” Whitman said in a keynote address at the company’s Discover  conference  for customers in  Las Vegas . “Hewlett-Packard is here to stay.”  CEO since September 2011, Whitman is accelerating investment in research and development to return the company to growth after seven straight quarters of  declining  sales.  Enterprise Market  “HP is under a lot of pressure to make a mark in the crowded enterprise-analytics market, and Whitman needs to justify a lavish and troubled acquisition history and make good on a multiyear commitment to software that has yet to produce any big wins,” said Josh Greenbaum, an analyst at Enterprise Applications Consulting in Berkeley,  California . “The next step would be to find a niche where HP can differentiate, and the one software sector where HP has credibility is in systems management and analytics.”  Haven works with the open-source Hadoop software to  analyze  big data, the vast quantity of data amassed by businesses, governments and universities that requires powerful computers for storage and analysis. Hewlett-Packard spent about $12 billion on the acquisitions behind Haven, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hewlett-Packard is investing in data-center computer equipment and software in order to rely less on its slumping PC and printing  divisions . Haven pits Hewlett-Packard against  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) ,  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ,  SAP AG (SAP) ,  Teradata Corp. (TDC)  and closely held SAS Institute in the big-data market.  Big Data  Total revenue from hardware, software and services aimed at analyzing big data is projected to rise to $23.8 billion in 2016 from $11 billion this year, according to market researcher IDC.  A network of resellers will also start selling a package of products that offers discounts on Hewlett-Packard’s PCs and printers when they’re purchased with Google’s Web-based productivity software. The move is a way to add value to commodity hardware products, according to Ron Coughlin, a Hewlett-Packard senior vice president.  “Anytime you solve a customer’s problem, you’re sticky, and you tend to provide value and generate profit,” he said. For small businesses, “the less they have to focus on IT, the more valuable you are to them.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Aaron Ricadela in  San Francisco  at  aricadela@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net
