U.S. stocks pared early losses, with
the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  reovering most of a 153-point
drop triggered after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said
he saw no need to expand monetary stimulus immediately.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was down 0.2 percent at
1,639.21 at 11:34 p.m. in New  York after falling as much as 1.2
percent. The Dow was down 2.5 points at 15,236.09.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
