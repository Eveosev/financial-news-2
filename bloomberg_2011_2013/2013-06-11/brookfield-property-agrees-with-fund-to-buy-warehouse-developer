Brookfield Property Partners LP (BPY-U)  and
institutional partners through a fund managed by a Brookfield
Asset Management Inc. affiliate agreed to buy a U.K. warehouse
developer from  Dubai World (DPW) ’s Economic Zones World unit.  Brookfield Property Partners, the commercial real estate
company spun off from Brookfield Asset Management in April, will
own 30 percent of EZW Gazeley Ltd., according to a statement
today. Terms of the transaction weren’t disclosed. A person
briefed on the situation said in April that the business was
valued at about 300 million pounds ($465 million).  Brookfield has been trying to expand in industrial
properties as global trade grows. EZW Gazeley, based in London,
develops large-scale logistics warehouses and distribution
centers in western  Europe  and China, according to the statement.  Brookfield Property’s spinoff from Toronto-based Brookfield
Asset Management took effect April 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
