Idemitsu Kosan Co., the Japanese
refiner that closed 23 percent of processing capacity since
2003, will boost crude and oil-products trading in  Singapore  as
it expands its business overseas.  Idemitsu plans to invest $9 billion with its partners to
build a 200,000 barrel-a-day refinery in  Vietnam  to capture
increasing demand there amid falling domestic consumption. The
Nghi Son plant is scheduled to begin operation in 2017.  “We have to enhance the function of the Singapore office
because we will have new refinery in Vietnam,” Takashi Tsukioka, president-designate of the company, said in a May 31
interview. “Countries such as Myanmar, Laos and  Cambodia  are
also expected to develop further.”  Japan ’s gasoline demand will shrink 31 percent by 2020 from
2010 levels and 60 percent by 2030 due to improving  fuel
efficiency , according to forecasts by Japan’s Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry.  Idemitsu’s Singapore unit, which consists of three traders,
will be responsible for arranging crude shipments to Vietnam
from  Kuwait , Tsukioka said. Idemitsu and Kuwait Petroleum
International each have a 35.1 percent stake in the project. The
refinery is designed to process heavy crude with 30.2 degrees of
gravity as defined by the  American Petroleum Institute ,
according to a statement posted on Idemitsu’s  website .  Oil Procurement  The Singapore team will also be responsible for buying oil
products for Freedom Energy Holdings Pty, Idemitsu’s Australian
oil-distribution unit, and finding customers for products
exported from Japan, he said.  The refiner in December bought 100 percent of Freedom
Energy, which owns an import terminal in Brisbane, Queensland,
and sells wholesale fuel and operates about 40 gas stations on
 Australia ’s east coast.  Idemitsu plans to boost fuel exports by 19 percent to 1.3
million kiloliters in the fiscal year that began on April 1,
according to its earnings  statement .  The company closed its 80,000 barrel-a-day Hyogo refinery
and 110,000 barrel-a-day Okinawa plant in 2003 to reduce
refining capacity because of slowing oil-product consumption in
the country. It also plans to stop refining at the 120,000
barrel-a-day Tokuyama refinery in March 2014 to meet trade
ministry requirements. Prior to 2003 it had a total processing
capacity of 830,000 barrels a day.  The ministry required Japanese refiners in 2010 to either
increase the ratio of residue cracking compared with crude
distillation to compel them to modernize their plants or cut
capacity to ease an oversupplied market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
