The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in Asia against non-payment rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  advanced 3 basis points to 133 basis
points as of 8:13 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge, which increased 9
basis points last month, is set for its highest close since Oct.
2, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 1.5 basis points to
94 as of 8:56 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices.
The measure has ranged from 74 to 115 basis points this quarter,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at 118
basis points as of 10:08 a.m. in Sydney, National  Australia  Bank
Ltd. prices show. Markets in Australia were closed for a public
holiday yesterday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
