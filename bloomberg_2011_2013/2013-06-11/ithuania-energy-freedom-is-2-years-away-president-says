Lithuania  must intensify efforts to
diversify its gas and power supplies so the Baltic nation can
shed the “shackles” of energy dependence on Russia by 2015,
President Dalia Grybauskaite said.  “We’ve already initiated historic changes,” Grybauskaite
said today in her annual state-of-the-nation speech to
parliament in Vilnius, the capital. “We have to hold out for at
least two more years, then we’ll be able to breathe easier.”  Since agreeing to shut a Soviet-built nuclear plant as a
condition for joining the European Union in 2004, Lithuania has
relied on Russia’s OAO Gazprom for natural-gas imports and on
OAO Inter RAO UES for much of its electricity. Now the country
plans by 2015 to complete  power lines  linking it to Poland and
Sweden and a liquefied natural-gas terminal on the  Baltic Sea .  The president criticized Prime Minister Algirdas
Butkevicius’s government, which took office in December, for
being too slow so far making decisions on issues including
whether to build a new nuclear plant and grant shale-gas
exploration rights to the U.S. energy company,  Chevron Corp. (CVX)   “While we bicker indecisively drafting a national energy
strategy, our seventh, decisions are being made for us” by
outside people and events, Grybauskaite said. “It’s time to get
to work.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
