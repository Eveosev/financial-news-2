Schaeffler AG, the biggest
shareholder in car-parts maker  Continental AG (CON) , will phase out
production of wheel bearings at a German factory, eliminating
576 jobs because of high costs and tough competition.  Manufacturing of the components at a plant in Schweinfurt
will wind down over the next two to three years, Marcus Brans, a
spokesman for the Herzogenaurach, Germany-based company, said
today by phone. The move comes after the company didnâ€™t win new
orders for the parts, he said.  Schaeffler is keen to maintain profit margins as it
explores options to ease the debt burden stemming from its
investment in Continental. The company reported an 11 percent
drop in first-quarter earnings on weaker demand for industrial
goods. Net debt amounted to 6.8 billion euros.  Schaeffler will maintain 300 jobs at the site. The company
will try to avoid firings and will offer early retirement
packages, Brans said. Negotiations with the unions have started.
The manufacturer employs about 29,000 people in  Germany , about
38 percent of its global workforce.  DPA-AFX reported earlier on the shutdown at the site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
