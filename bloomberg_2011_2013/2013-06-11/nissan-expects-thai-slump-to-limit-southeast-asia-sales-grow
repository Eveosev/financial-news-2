Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ,  Japan ’s second-largest carmaker, said a slump in demand in  Thailand  will
undermine sales growth in Southeast Asia.  Sales in the five Southeast Asian countries of Indonesia,
Malaysia, the  Philippines , Thailand, and  Vietnam , will probably
reach 270,000 units in the 12 months ending March, compared with
about 260,000 a year earlier, Takayuki Kimura, the Bangkok-based
president of Nissan Motor Asia Pacific Co., said in an interview
yesterday. That 4 percent projected increase trails Nissan’s
forecast for global  volume growth  of 7.8 percent.  While sales in Thailand jumped 80 percent to 138,000 units
in the year ended March, the total slumped to about 9,000 in the
two months through May. May sales in Thailand were 4,550 units,
Nissan said on June 10, citing “the expiration of the
government’s first-car buyer incentive program” as hurting the
sub-compact car segment.  “The Thai market, this fiscal year, has significantly
dropped,” Kimura said in the central Vietnamese city of Danang,
where  Malaysia ’s Tan Chong Group yesterday opened a $40 million
plant that will produce Nissans.  The Yokohama, Japan-based carmaker expects sales to recover
to about 10,000 units a month in Thailand later in the year,
according to Kimura.  Thai Consumption  “I’m a bit worried about Thai consumption,” said
Santitarn Sathirathai, a Singapore-based economist at Credit
Suisse Group AG. “Consumers leveraged to take advantage of this
incentive scheme so debt-to-income levels have gone up, and
together with some weaker farm income, consumer spending may be
facing quite a headwind.”  Nissan, which is targeting annual sales of 500,000 vehicles
in the five Southeast Asian countries in the year to March 2017
for 15 percent of the regional market, said its share will
“significantly” increase to about 7 percent this year.  “We are on the right track” to reach the 500,000 units
target, Kimura said.  Nissan expects sales in the region will see a “big jump”
in 2014 with the introduction of the Datsun brand in  Indonesia .
The first Datsun model will meet the government’s incentive
requirements in the country, Kimura said.  “The government has repeatedly said that in order to be
categorized as a low-cost green car, your price must be below
100 million Indonesian rupiah ($10,175),” said Kimura. “So we
are aiming at that price range.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
