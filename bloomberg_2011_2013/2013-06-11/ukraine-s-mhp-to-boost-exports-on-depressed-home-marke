Mironovskiy Hleboproduct SA (MHPC) ,
Ukraine’s biggest poultry producer, wants to boost the amount of
meat it exports because domestic consumption has not grown in
six years, Chief Executive Officer Yuriy Kosyuk said.  MHP wants to ship half of the poultry it produces abroad to
as many as 30 countries, Kosyuk told reporters today in Kiev.
The company exports more than 30 percent of its poultry now to
25 countries, Kosyuk said.  MHP expects to produce about 470,000 tons of chicken meat
this year and will be adding 10 percent to its poultry output
annually through the end of 2015, he said. Consumer demand for
poultry inside Ukraine has not changed in the past five or six
years and prices have been the same in one and a half years.  “External markets are becoming more and more
interesting,” Kosyuk said.  Ukraine slipped into recession in the second half of last
year after Europe’s debt crisis cut demand for the country’s
main exports, such as steel. The economy shrank 1.1 percent in
the first quarter from a year earlier, and recorded a deflation
for a seventh month in May.  MHP is using a biogas facility at its poultry plant in the
Dnipropetrovsk region that will operate at full capacity in two
or three months, Kosyuk said. The plant cost MHP $20 million, he
said.  Depending on efficiency tests of existing biogas
production, the company will decide on investing another $350
million in five years for 13 biogas facilities at its seven
poultry plants to help cut energy costs, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
