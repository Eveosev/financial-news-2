Minorities seeking to rent or buy
homes are shown fewer available units than whites, according to
a study released today by the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development.  The  study , the fourth of its kind since 1977, found that
blatant acts of housing discrimination such as refusing to
provide information to minority home-seekers have steadily
declined over the past three decades.  “Fewer minorities today may be getting the door slammed in
their faces, but we continue to see evidence of housing
discrimination that can limit a family’s housing, economic and
educational opportunities,” HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan said in
a statement today.  In the study, conducted by the  Urban Institute , white
testers were paired with black, Hispanic or Asian testers in 28
cities to inquire about available units more than 8,000 times.
White testers were told about and shown more units in housing
markets throughout the country.  Black testers were told about 11 percent fewer rental units
than white testers and were told about 17 percent fewer
available homes for sale. They were shown 4 percent fewer rental
units and 18 percent fewer homes for sale.  The study found similar discrepancies for Asians and
Hispanics, with the exception that Hispanic testers were treated
similarly to white testers when inquiring about homes for sale.  Enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which bans housing
discrimination, has been a priority of the administration of
President Barack H. Obama.  “It’s clear we still have work to do,” Donovan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
