Saudi Arabia ’s General Authority of
Civil Aviation, which raised 15 billion riyals ($4 billion) from
Islamic bonds sale last year, hired three banks for another
local-currency offering, a banker familiar with the matter said.  The Saudi Arabian affiliate of  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  National
Commercial Bank ’s investment banking unit and  Standard Chartered 
Plc will manage the sukuk sale, according to the banker, who
asked not to be identified because the information is private.
NCB Capital and Standard Chartered bid jointly for the mandate.  A spokesman for the authority known as GACA, who asked not
to be identified because of company policy, confirmed that banks
have been hired for a sukuk sale. He declined to specify how
much the authority sought to raise.  Reuters, which reported the story earlier today, said GACA
may sell 15 billion riyals in an offering before the start of
Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting which is due to start next
month. The GACA spokesman said the timing of the sale hasn’t yet
been decided.  GACA said last year it plans to issue a second tranche of
notes complying with Islam’s ban on paying interest to fund an
airport expansion in the Saudi capital,  Riyadh .  Issuers in Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter,
sold a record amount of sukuk in 2012 as borrowing costs
plunged. GACA sold Islamic debt last year at 2.5 percent and
used proceeds to finance an airport expansion in the Red Sea
port city of Jeddah.  To contact the reporters on this story:
