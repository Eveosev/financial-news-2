The Pentagon sent Congress a report
providing details of $37 billion in sequestration cuts affecting
defense contractors from  Lockheed (LMT)  Martin Corp. to  Huntington
Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII)   The report, provided yesterday and required by the current
year’s defense appropriations measure, lists the amounts that
Congress appropriated for the Pentagon’s 2,500 programs, project
and budget activities, and shows how much each will be reduced
by the automatic spending reductions that took effect March 1.  The Air Force’s $2.5 billion to buy 19 F-35 jets made by
Lockheed reflects a sequestration cut of $503 million, according
to the report. The Navy’s final $808 million to buy four
carrier-model F-35s incorporates a $157 million cut, and its $1
billion for six Marine Corps short-takeoff-and vertical landing
fighters reflects a $146 million reduction.  While the report doesn’t spell out the number of weapons
cut in each program, defense companies will be able to use the
report to determine “what funding is available for that
particular program for the fiscal year,” John Roth, the
Pentagon’s deputy comptroller for programs and budgets, said in
an interview.  The purpose is to provide Congress a baseline of Pentagon
funding that defense committees will review as they consider a
Pentagon reprogramming request to move $9.6 billion between
categories and mostly into readiness accounts.  V-22, Drones  In other weapons cuts, the Navy’s $1.3 billion
appropriation to buy 18 additional V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor
aircraft from  Boeing Co. (BA)  and Bell Helicopter  Textron Inc. (TXT) 
reflects an $18 million reduction.  The Air Force’s final $82 million on 717 laser-guided
Lockheed Hellfire missiles fired by Predator and Reaper drones
incorporates a cut of $313,000.  On shipbuilding, the $1.74 billion Congress approved for
construction of Littoral Combat Ships made by Lockheed and
 Austal Ltd. (ASB)  reflects a cut of $43.6 million, and $437 million
provided as a down payment on DDG-51 destroyers built by
Huntington Ingalls and  General Dynamics Corp. (GD)  reflects a $28
million reduction.  The $3 billion for two additional Virginia-class submarines
made by Huntington Ingalls and General Dynamics reflects a $227
million reduction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
