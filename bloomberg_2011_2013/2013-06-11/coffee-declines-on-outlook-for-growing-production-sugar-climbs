Coffee declined in  London  and New
York on signs of increased production of both robustas and
arabica beans. Sugar climbed.  Arabica production for the 2012-13 crop that ends in
September in most countries will jump 5.7 percent and robusta
output will climb 8.8 percent, the  International Coffee
Organization  said in a report on its website today.  Brazil ’s
2013-14 crop now being harvested is set to be a record for an
off-year in its biennial production cycle, it said.  “The new reality of a greatly diminished on-off cycle in
Brazil, with the possibility of increased carry-over stocks, is
resulting in a more constant availability of arabicas year on
year,” the ICO said.  Robusta for July delivery fell 0.6 percent to $1,834 a
metric ton on NYSE Liffe by 11 a.m. Arabica futures declined 0.2
percent to $1.2855 a pound ($2,834 a ton) on ICE Futures U.S.  Raw sugar climbed 0.2 percent to 16.41 cents a pound and
white, or refined, sugar advanced 0.3 percent to $480.70 a ton.  Cocoa in  New York  dropped 0.6 percent to $2,355 a ton and
in London declined 0.3 percent to 1,550 pounds ($2,411) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
