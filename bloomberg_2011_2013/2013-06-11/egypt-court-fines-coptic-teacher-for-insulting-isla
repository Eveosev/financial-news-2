An Egyptian court has fined a Coptic
Christian teacher 100,000 pounds ($14,300) for insulting Islam
and proselytizing at a primary school in Upper  Egypt .  The case of Demiana Ebeid Abdel-Nour will be referred to
the designated court, Luxor Misdemeanors Court said in a faxed
statement today. The case against her is based on a complaint
lodged by the parents alleging that she insulted Islam during a
class, court said. Abdel-Nour was released last month on 20,000
pounds bail pending further investigation.  Romani Mourad, a Coptic Christian lawyer, was sentenced on
June 1 to one year in prison in absentia and fined 10,000
pounds, also for insulting Islam and the Koran. Two days later,
several human-rights groups issued a statement condemning “the
rise in numbers of cases” where Copts stood accused of
insulting religion. These “strongly indicate that such cases
have become a weapon for religious discrimination and oppression
of religious minorities, the groups said.  Egypt’s constitution, approved in a December referendum,
has sparked a wave of criticism from activists and human-rights
groups, arguing the charter fails to protect human rights.
Article 44 in the draft prohibits insulting any prophet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
