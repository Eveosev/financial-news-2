Treasuries climbed as investors
sought haven while the dollar, stocks and commodities fell as
risk appetite faded.  U.S. debt yields fell after rising following an auction of
$32 billion of Treasury three-year notes that drew the lowest
demand since 2010. They climbed earlier to 14-month highs amid
concern the  Federal Reserve  will slow monetary stimulus. The yen
strengthened beyond 100 per dollar after the  Bank of Japan 
refrained from introducing additional stimulus measures.  “We’re seeing the influences of international markets,”
said  Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $2.1 billion as chief
investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union in New
York. “We have yen strengthening, which has really been the
focus of the bond market for some time. Now we have a bit of a
rally offsetting the much weaker auction we had.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.19 percent at 2:24 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It increased earlier
to 2.29 percent, the highest since April 4, 2012.  Thirty-year bond yields slid four basis points to 3.33
percent after rising earlier to 3.43 percent, also the highest
since April 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
