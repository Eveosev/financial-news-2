Gasoline fell for a second day on
speculation that U.S. fuel supplies are increasing. Crack
spreads narrowed.  Futures dropped as much as 2.2 percent. An Energy
Information Administration report tomorrow may show gasoline
stockpiles probably rose 500,000 barrels, or 0.2 percent, to
219.3 million, based on the median of 10 analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Six respondents projected a gain and four
forecast a drop.  “The market could see pressure from improving gasoline
supplies as refiners turn this near-record amount of crude oil
inventory into increasing amounts of products,”  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston, said in a
phone interview.  Gasoline for July delivery fell 5.5 cents, or 1.9 percent,
