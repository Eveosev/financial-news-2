The European Union will press EU
governments to permit negotiations over local-content media
rules as part of a bargaining strategy for planned trade talks
with the U.S., EU officials told reporters in Brussels.  In the discussions, the European side should defend the
current rules -- known as the “cultural exception” -- while
leaving open the possibility of limited concessions on future
regulations in order to have more leverage on other issues such
as public procurement, the officials said today. France has
pressed for cultural-diversity rules to be completely excluded
from the talks on a free-trade pact with the U.S.  EU trade ministers will meet in Luxembourg on June 14 to
discuss a mandate to begin the negotiations with the U.S., which
are slated to start next month. On cultural issues, the EU
should pledge to maintain all current quotas, taxes and
subsidies related to audio-visual media and cultural diversity
regulations, the Brussels-based European Commission said in a
policy paper distributed to nations last week.  At the same time, the commission wants the ability to
negotiate about what future rules might be on broadcast quotas,
the Internet and other new technology platforms or other new
media, the officials said. The goal is to make sure EU nations
have enough room to pass new measures without closing off the
possibility of concessions to the U.S., the officials said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
