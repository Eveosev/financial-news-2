Inflation has taken hold in the
stock market as the prospects for earnings and the economy are
worsening, according to Barry C. Knapp, Barclays Plc’s head of
U.S. equity strategy.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how Knapp drew his conclusion,
presented in a June 7 report. He compared the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index’s forward price-earnings ratio, based on anticipated
profits, with the  Institute for Supply Management ’s new-order
index for manufacturers.  During May, the forward P/E climbed to a three-year high of
15.2, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yet the ISM gauge
fell last month to 48.8, its lowest level since July. Readings
below 50 signal a contraction in new orders.  The contrast shows how much stocks have been affected by
the  Federal Reserve ’s bond purchases, Knapp wrote. He described
the central bank’s policy of quantitative easing as “QE4ever,”
referring to the three rounds of buying authorized so far and
the potential for more.  “We can’t help but conclude that QE4ever has contributed
to asset inflation,” Knapp wrote. “In our view, this was the
Fed’s intent.” The New York-based strategist expects the  S&P
500  to end the year at 1,525, a decline of 7.2 percent from
yesterday’s close.  Stocks may do little to safeguard investors from the risk
of accelerating inflation in the economy, he added. He cited a
historical analysis that showed equities were “a poor hedge,”
especially when consumer prices were surging or in periods of
stagflation, when the economy was contracting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
