Desalitech Ltd. , a Boston-based
company specializing in desalination and industrial water-treatment technologies to lower costs and energy consumption,
will receive $5 million more from Liberation Capital.  That brings to $9.5 million that Liberation Capital has
invested in Desalitech, which has raised about $13 million
total, according to a statement today. Desalitech, which was
founded in  Israel  and first deployed commercial units in 2009,
said its closed-circuit desalination system recovers more water
using less energy than other reverse-osmosis methods.  With most U.S. manufacturers already using reverse-osmosis
systems, in addition to applications in agriculture and fossil-fuel industries, “we’re anticipating exponential growth with
this company,” Desalitech Executive Vice President Richard Stover said yesterday in an interview. “Really, anywhere
there’s a boiler or a cooling tower, they need purified water.”  With industry accounting for about 60 percent of freshwater
withdrawals in the developed world, straining water resources,
Desalitech technologies “are ideal for industrial and
agricultural water-treatment, where fresh water supply and
effluent disposal costs have become a burden,” Jeff Garwood,
managing director of Liberation Capital, said in the statement.  Desalitech’s CCD system can desalinate seawater using 25
percent to 50 percent less energy than similar reverse-osmosis
methods, achieving 97 percent recovery compared with 75 percent,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
