Russia ’s OAO  Gazprom (OGZD)  said it voted
under duress to split up Lietuvos Dujos AB at a meeting of the
Lithuanian natural-gas utility’s shareholders today and reserved
all legal rights to contest the decision.  Shareholders, including Gazprom with a 37 percent stake,
 Germany ’s  EON AG (EOAN)  with 39 percent and the Lithuanian Energy
Ministry with 18 percent, approved terms for the transfer of
transmission activity to AB Amber Grid, a new company, Lietuvos
Dujos  said  on the website of the Nasdaq OMX Vilnius exchange.  Gazprom only voted in favor “as the result of the coercion
and pressure exerted by the State Authorities of Lithuania,
including threats to apply sanctions,” the Russian gas exporter
and pipeline owner said in a statement annexed to the
announcement.  Lithuania  is splitting ownership of gas sales and
transmission activities to meet European Union rules intended to
boost competition. Gazprom will be forced to sell its stake in
the new company, losing influence over the pipelines that
deliver gas to Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave.  The coercion used for the decision “actually calls for the
review of the terms and conditions under which Lietuvos Dujos
was privatized” in 2004, Gazprom said.  The spinoff is due to take effect on July 31.  Shareholders also decided to retain the current board
members of Lietuvos Dujos, who met separately today and agreed
to keep Viktoras Valentukevicius as general manager, the utility
said.  Lietuvos Dujos shares rose 1 percent to 0.601 euro today in
Vilnius before the announcement, valuing the company at 282
million euros ($374 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
