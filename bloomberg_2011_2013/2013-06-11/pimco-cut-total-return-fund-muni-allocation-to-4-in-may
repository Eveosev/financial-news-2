Bill Gross , manager of the world’s
biggest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management Co., cut its
stake in municipal debt to 4 percent of assets, the lowest
allocation in nine months, the company said today.  The last time the Total Return Fund, valued at  $285 billion 
as of May 31, held such a small amount of munis was in July
2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gross directed 5
percent of assets to state and local debt from August 2012
through April.  Pimco released the latest data on its website.  Michael Reid, a spokesman for  Newport Beach , California-based Pimco, declined to say why the muni allocation was
reduced.  Mark Porterfield , a spokesman for Gross, also had no
comment.  The $3.7 trillion municipal market lost 1.3 percent in May,
the worst month for returns on the tax-exempt securities since
December, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. For
the year through June 10, the decline was 0.45 percent, compared
with a 1.5 percent loss for Treasuries, the indexes show.  Pimco’s Total Return Fund  lost  1.25 percent this year
through June 10, beating 28 percent of its peers, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. In the past five years, it has
earned about 7.8 percent, topping 94 percent of peers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
