Bank of Ireland Plc extended
declines today as  Fitch Ratings  said yesterday loan impairments
at the biggest Irish lender by assets and rival Allied Irish
Banks Plc may rise and the lenders may need more capital.  Bank of Ireland fell as much as 7.6 percent in Dublin
trading, following a 5 percent drop yesterday after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. cut its rating on the company’s stock to sell
from neutral. It is the biggest two-day fall since May of last
year, with the bank helping lead the benchmark ISEQ Index down.  “As Irish banks’ capital ratios continue to be eroded and
a return to profitability only appears feasible in the longer
term, the banks may need to raise additional capital before they
can contemplate a future independent of state support,” Denzil
De Bie, a director in Fitch’s Financial Institutions Group said
in a statement yesterday. “Impairment charges could increase
during 2013 and 2014 as the banks accelerate the resolution of
mortgage arrears.”  Goldman Sachs said in a note that  Bank of Ireland (BKIR) ’s
discount compared to European peers had closed this year and was
trading at 1 times estimated tangible book value, up from 0.6
times at the start of 2013. About 22.9 million shares traded
hands in Dublin, the equivalent of 25 percent of average daily
trading volume during the past three months.  Bank of Ireland fell 3.5 percent to 16.5 euro cents as of
9:12 a.m.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
