Rambus Inc. (RMBS)  said it settled its
patent litigation with  SK Hynix Inc. (000660)  and signed a license
agreement for the South Korean memory-chip maker to use its
technology.  “This is a milestone agreement for both companies that
puts years of legal disputes behind us and gives us the
opportunity for collaboration,” Rambus Chief Executive Officer
Ron Black said yesterday in a statement.  The five-year agreement with SK Hynix will bring in $12
million a quarter, according to the statement.  A federal judge in San Jose,  California , last month ordered
Rambus to pay $250 million to SK Hynix for destroying documents
in their litigation. Rambus, based in Sunnyvale, California, won
a $349 million judgment on its patent-infringement claims in
2006.  Representatives of SK Hynix didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail seeking comment on a licensing accord.  Rambus’s cases against SK Hynix, and another related case
against  Micron Technology Inc. (MU) , are over the companies’ use of
interfaces that are part of dynamic random access memory that
acts as the main memory in computers. DRAM is built to industry
standards and is interchangeable by product.  The case is Hynix Semiconductor Inc. v. Rambus Inc.,  00-cv-20905, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
