Exide Technologies (XIDE) , the 125-year-old
battery maker, won initial court approval to borrow as much as
$500 million to replace older loans and stay in business while
it reorganizes in bankruptcy.  About $225 million of the new debt will go to pay off and
replace a $160 million revolving  credit line , with any money
left over used for operations, according to court papers. The
other $275 million will be partly supplied by a group of
noteholders that holds 45 percent of the company’s bonds that
mature in 2018.  The new loans “are a strong endorsement of the company’s
efforts to restore itself to profitability as a going concern,”
the company said in papers filed yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court  in Wilmington, Delaware.  Exide, based in Milton, Georgia, filed for bankruptcy
yesterday after state regulators shut down the company’s lead-recycling plant in Vernon, California. The April closing forced
Exide to speed up its  restructuring plans  by hiring  law firm 
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and financial adviser
Alvarez & Marsal North America LLC, according to court records.  With today’s interim approval by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Kevin Carey, the company will get access to about $170 million
of the new debt. The rest of the loans can’t be disbursed unless
Carey gives final approval after allowing creditors to object at
a hearing to be scheduled in coming weeks.  The case is In re Exide Technologies, 13-11482, U.S
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
