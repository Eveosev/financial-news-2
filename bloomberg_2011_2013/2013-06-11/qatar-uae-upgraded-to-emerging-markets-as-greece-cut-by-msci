Qatar and the United Arab Emirates
were upgraded to emerging-market status at  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) , while
Greece lost its classification as a developed market.  The New York-based index provider, whose stock gauges are
tracked by investors with about $7 trillion in assets,
downgraded Morocco to a frontier market. MSCI will keep South
Korea and Taiwan’s emerging-market status, and placed China A-shares on review for potential inclusion in the emerging-markets
category, according to a statement today. Israel wasn’t added to
the MSCI Europe Index.  MSCI tracks economic development, trading volumes and
market accessibility to assess market classifications. Upgrades
could lead to the nations’ equities luring more of the investor
assets that follow MSCI’s gauges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
