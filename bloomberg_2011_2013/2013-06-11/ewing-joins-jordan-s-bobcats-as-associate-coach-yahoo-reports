Patrick Ewing  has agreed to become
associate head coach of the Charlotte Bobcats, who are owned by
former National Basketball Association rival and Olympic
teammate  Michael Jordan ,  Yahoo Sports reports .  Ewing, 50, will join the staff of coach Steve Clifford, who
was hired by the Bobcats on May 29 after spending the past 13
years as an NBA assistant. Ewing worked with Clifford in both
Houston (2003-08) and Orlando (2008-12).  Ewing had interviewed for the Bobcats’ coaching vacancy in
2012 before it went to Mike Dunlap, who was fired in April after
going 21-61 in his first season. Charlotte’s 21 wins were the
second-fewest in the NBA. Ewing also interviewed for the Detroit
Pistons’ coaching job in 2011.  Ewing and Jordan were rivals during their NBA playing
careers, meeting in the playoffs six times when Ewing led the
 New York  Knicks and Jordan was with the Chicago Bulls. They also
played together on gold medal-winning teams for the U.S. at the
Olympics in 1984 and 1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
