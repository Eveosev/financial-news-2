The  New York Rangers  will meet with
former Buffalo Sabres coach Lindy Ruff about their coaching
vacancy,  ESPN reported , citing an unidentified person familiar
with the situation.  Ruff, 53, had been the National Hockey League’s longest-tenured coach before being fired by the Sabres in February after
15 seasons with the team. Ruff led the Sabres to 562 wins and
eight playoff appearances, most recently in 2011, and played for
the Rangers from 1988-91. It’s not known when he’ll interview
with club officials, ESPN said.  The Rangers fired  John Tortorella  last month after losing
in the second round of the NHL playoffs.  The Rangers previously got permission to speak with ex-Vancouver Canucks coach Alain Vigneault and Toronto Maple Leafs
minor-league coach Dallas Eakins about their coaching job.
Eakins was hired yesterday as coach of the Edmonton Oilers.  Mark Messier, who was team captain the last time the
Rangers won the  Stanley Cup  in 1994, is also interested in the
coaching vacancy, according to the  New York  Daily News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
