The Energy Information
Administration lowered its forecast for gasoline demand for 2013
to the lowest level in 12 years and left unchanged its forecast
for summer pump prices.  Gasoline  consumption  this year will average 8.66 million
barrels a day, lower than the 8.68 million in last month’s
projection and the lowest level since 2001, the statistical arm
of the Energy Department said today in its monthly Short-Term
Energy Outlook. Demand in 2014 may be 8.68 million barrels a
day, down from last month’s forecast of 8.69 million.  Distillate demand, including diesel and heating oil, will
be 3.82 million barrels a day this year, up from last month’s
outlook of 3.8 million. Consumption in 2014 is estimated to be
3.83 million, higher than the previous forecast of 3.81 million.  U.S. consumers will pay an average 16 cents a gallon less
for gasoline this summer than a year ago, unchanged from the
EIA’s May forecast.  The agency expects regular-grade  gasoline  will average
$3.53 a gallon from April through September. Diesel fuel will
average $3.83 a gallon, less than the prior forecast of 3.88.  Regular-grade gasoline will average $3.49 a gallon this
year, down from last month’s forecast of $3.50. Prices in 2012
averaged $3.63 a gallon.  Prices may average $3.37 in 2014, the department said, down
from the May estimate of $3.39.  To contact the reporter on this story:
