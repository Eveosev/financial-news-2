Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest
U.S. oil company, said it plans to sell its interest in two
Nigerian shallow-water leases in the oil-rich delta of Africa’s
top producer.  The sale of interest in oil-mining leases 83 and 85 is
“part of a continuous process of portfolio evaluation and
business prioritization,” James Craig, a Houston-based company
spokesman, said today in an e-mailed response to questions.  Chevron, the third-largest producer in the West African
country, operates a joint venture in which it holds a 40 percent
stake and state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. owns 60
percent. The company holds interests in 10 deepwater oil blocks
in Nigeria, including its 250,000 barrel-a-day Agbami field
located 70 miles (113 kilometers) off the coast.  Chevron joins  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  ConocoPhillips (COP)  in
selling Nigerian oil interests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
