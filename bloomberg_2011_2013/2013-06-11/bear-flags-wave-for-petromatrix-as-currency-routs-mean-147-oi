Crude is costing some  developing
countries  almost $150 a barrel in real terms as currencies from
the rupee to the rand tumble, signaling global oil demand is
poised to weaken, according to Petromatrix GmbH.  Brent prices converted into  India ’s rupee, South Africa’s
rand, Turkey’s lira and Brazil’s real are close to levels
reached in mid-2008, when crude climbed to a record, the Zug,
Switzerland-based researcher said. The burden is canceling any
stimulus for demand in these countries that might have arisen 
from this year’s slump in the oil price, and represents a 
“bearish flag” for consumption, Petromatrix estimates.  “Brent is not cheap by any standards for  emerging
markets ,”  Olivier Jakob , Petromatrix’s managing director, said
today by phone. “For many emerging markets the price of Brent
in local currency is currently as bad as the $147 of 2008.”  India’s rupee tumbled to a record 58.9850 per dollar today
amid slowing growth in Asia’s third-biggest economy, while South
Africa’s rand fell to a four-year low after mining output in
Africa’s largest economy unexpectedly shrank. Brazil’s real
touched its weakest level in four years yesterday, at 2.1471 per
dollar. Turkey’s lira slumped by 1.2 percent yesterday, the most
since May 2012, amid protests against the government led by
Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan .  This trend of weakening currencies has a “significant
impact” on prices in those nations, posing a “bearish flag
that is getting bigger by the day for the world’s oil demand
growth,” Jakob said.  India, Brazil, Turkey and  South Africa  collectively used an
average of 7.4 million barrels of oil a day in 2011, or 8
percent of the global total, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s annual
Statistical Review of World Energy, published last June. Brent
has lost about 8 percent on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange this year, trading today at $102 a barrel. The grade
surged to a peak of $147.50 on July 11, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
