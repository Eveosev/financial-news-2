Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , a Danish
wind-turbine maker, will supply a 160 million-euro ($213
million) project in  South Africa  as the country seeks to reduce
its dependence on coal-fired energy.  Aurora Wind Power, a venture led by GDF Suez SA, ordered 47
 V90  2-megawatt turbines for its West Coast One project, Vestas
said today in a statement, without disclosing terms. The
contract includes a 15-year service agreement.  South Africa plans to add 3,725 megawatts in renewable
energy capacity by the end of 2016 through a program of five
tenders to help curb its reliance on coal for electricity. The
country is targeting an additional 3,200 megawatts by the end of
the decade, with more than a third of that wind power.  Vestas will deliver its machines in the third quarter of
2014 and the wind farm is due to start by May 2015, according to
the Aarhus-based company. The project, in which  GDF Suez (GSZ)  owns 43
percent and Investec Ltd. and Kagiso Investment the rest, will
be funded by equity and debt from local banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
