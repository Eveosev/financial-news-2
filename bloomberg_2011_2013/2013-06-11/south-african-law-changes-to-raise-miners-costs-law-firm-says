Changes to  South Africa ’s mining
laws are likely to raise regulatory costs after amendments came
into force last week, a law firm said.  The Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Amendment
Act, or MPRDA, became effective June 7 after being signed into
law by President  Jacob Zuma .  “The Amendment Act introduced a number of significant
amendments to South Africa’s mineral regulatory regime,”
Johannesburg-based law firm Webber Wentzel said in an e-mailed
note to clients. “This is likely to impose further compliance
and regulatory costs on the industry.”  South Africa, with the largest known reserves of platinum
and chrome, as well as gold, iron and diamonds, is bringing in
changes even as it plans a further amendment bill this year.
Higher expenses will further squeeze profits at mining companies
already contending with above-inflation cost increases for wages
and energy, while labor disputes and slumping commodity prices
have forced some producers to suspend shafts or cut jobs.  The changes stipulate that the mines minister must refuse
an application for prospecting rights should those rights
concentrate resources under the control one company, restricting
“equitable access,” according to the  law firm , which said the
vague phrasing leaves the rule open to interpretation.  The changes also allow the minister to impose stricter
conditions on mining rights where the land is occupied, which
may go beyond the requirements of the Mining Charter.  The alterations, originally proposed in 2008, may be
superseded by the Amendment Bill 2013 after it’s introduced to
parliament later in June, Webber Wentzel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
