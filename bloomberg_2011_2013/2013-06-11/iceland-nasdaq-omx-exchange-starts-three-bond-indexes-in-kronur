The  Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ)  Iceland exchange will
start three bond indexes based on nominal and inflation-linked
benchmark bonds, paving the way for exchange-traded funds in the
north Atlantic island nation’s securities market.  The three indexes, NOMXI benchmark bonds, NOMXI nominal
benchmark bonds and NOMXI inflation-linked bonds, will give
investors information about Iceland’s largest and most liquid
assets, the  exchange  said in a statement. The index values will
be given in Icelandic krona and will be calculated at the end of
each trading day.  “With the new Icelandic bond indexes we have a
comprehensive product offering in the Icelandic bond index
series,” Magdalena Hartman, vice president at Nasdaq OMX, said
in the statement. “Investors, asset managers and analysts will
now gain access to a reliable benchmark for Icelandic
government-guaranteed bonds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
