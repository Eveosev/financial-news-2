The ultimate golf vacation is available for $74,450, though there’s a wait on the first tee.  The 2014 trip departs from Maui, tees off in Fiji and ends 22 days later at Valderrama Golf Club in Sotogrande,  Spain . Covering five continents, it includes 12 rounds and transportation on a customized Boeing 757 jet.  Kalos Golf , a luxury golf cruise specialist, sold out the 78 slots and has a 21-person waiting list.  It’s an example of growing demand for ultraluxury travel amid rising numbers of wealthy people. While managed golf trips abound, such as Tiger Management LLC founder  Julian Robertson ’s $23,905 Tiger Tour, Kalos’s itinerary may be the sport’s grandest vacation, according to professionals in the industry.  “Private air, pampering, top courses and five-star hotels, it certainly sounds like an ultimate group trip to me,” said Craig Better, managing editor of  Golf Vacation Insider , a  Short Hills , New Jersey-based website and newsletter. “And to cover this much ground in this relatively short amount of time, that’s the ultimate, too.”  The interest has Kalos already planning for a 2015 world tour as well as shorter private jet trips to destinations such as Australia and  Southeast Asia .  “I thought, this is neat, it’s a signature program,” said Jim Lamont, the president of Kalos, about the world trip’s creation. “We’ll get a little bit of attention with it and we’ll see if we get 10 or 12 people. We’ve been floored that we’re already at a waiting list.”  The potential customers for such travel is growing. The number of high-net-wealth individuals worldwide, measured as those with $30 million or more in assets, rose 5 percent last year to 189,835, and that probably will double in the next decade, according to the 2013 Wealth Report by  Knight Frank .  Hotel Revenue  U.S. luxury hotel-room revenue was up 8.7 percent this year through March after rising each year from 2010 to 2012, according to data compiled by Smith Travel Research Inc.  New York-based Virtuoso, a luxury-travel network of more than 340 agencies in 20 North and South American countries, said that 76 percent of its affiliates in February reported year-over-year revenue gains, while 82 percent said future bookings had increased.  The highest end of the luxury travel market is “booming,” said Douglas Gollan, editor-in-chief of  Elite Traveler  magazine. A trip like Kalos’s world tour probably would interest someone with assets of around $10 million, Gollan said.  “There could be somebody who’s doing very well right now, such as an investment banker who got a bonus,” Gollan said. “They’re not uber-rich but 10 million bucks is still not chump change.”  The Kalos trip, which includes 51 hours of flying, begins on the Hawaiian island of Maui and visits Fiji,  Australia , Bali,  Thailand , Dubai, Mauritius and  South Africa  before concluding in Spain.  Twelve Rounds  Full golf travelers, limited to 40, will play 12 rounds, while 20 “Light Golf” participants will play six, paying $72,200. There are also 18 spots for touring-only guests at $69,950 and a supplement of $8,650 for single travelers.  Four of the 12 courses are ranked on Golf Digest’s 2012 list of top 100 courses outside the U.S: New South Wales Golf Club in Australia is rated 25th, Fancourt Links in South Africa is 30th; Spain’s Valderrama -- home of the 1997 Ryder Cup -- is 40th and Nirwani Bali Golf Club is 66th.  The East Course at Merion Golf Club in Ardmore,  Pennsylvania , which is hosting the U.S. Open this week, is ranked No. 6 in the U.S. by the magazine.  The allure of playing diverse courses while exploring the world in a single trip is what Arthur and Dino Moren said led them to sign up for the Kalos jet tour. The Greenwich,  Connecticut , couple have been on six previous Kalos Golf cruises and have another one planned for this fall.  New Courses  “We’ve been to 45 countries so this is saying a lot that they’ve found eight stops we haven’t been to,” Arthur Moren, 71, who was a security analyst for investment firm Jennison Associates LLC in  New York  before retiring, said in a telephone interview.  Moren says he’s a 21-handicap and Dino Moren says she’s an 18.  There are several other ultraluxury group travel operators, some selling vacations more expensive than Kalos’s.  Abercrombie & Kent , headquartered in  Downers Grove ,  Illinois , runs a 26-day private-jet non-golf world tour that’s hosted by one of its founders, Geoffrey Kent, for $105,000, limiting travelers to 50.  Tiger Tour  For golfers, Robertson’s Tiger Tour visits his three courses in  New Zealand . A nine-day March 2014 trip, which includes travel between courses via private jet and helicopter, sells for $23,905 (NZD $29,785) per person.  The priciest travel offer may come from London-based Hurlingham Travel and website VeryFirstTo.com, which put together a 990,000 pound ($1.5 million)  two-year trip  that visits the  962 places  considered to have outstanding universal value by the World Heritage Committee. Lamont said he thinks Kalos’s offer is the most extravagant among golf vacations.  “I don’t think there’s anything that compares with it,” he said. “What would be left, golf on the moon?”  That’s not available yet, though  Richard Branson ’s Virgin Galactic plans to begin two-hour commercial space flights shortly after completing testing at the end of this year. The cost: $250,000.
