Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc. (QCOR) , a
maker of treatments for nervous system disorders, rose the most
in almost nine months after buying the rights to the immune drug
Synacthen from  Novartis AG. (NOVN)   Questcor climbed 15 percent to $42.11 at the close in  New
York , its biggest increase since Sept. 20. Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis received $60 million upfront and will get $75
million more and possible milestone payments in coming years,
Anaheim, California-based Questcor said today.  Synacthen is used for the treatment of autoimmune and
inflammatory conditions, including ulcerative colitis and
chronic skin conditions. Questcor will develop the drug for sale
in the U.S., where it hasn’t been approved, and may sell it in
more than three dozen countries abroad.  “This key acquisition provides an opportunity to initiate
our presence in more than three dozen international markets,
giving us an opportunity to reinvigorate Synacthen in these
markets and providing us a platform for potential international
growth,” Don Bailey, Questcor’s chief executive officer, said
in a statement.  Questcor plans to set up operations in  Europe  to handle the
drug abroad. Last year, 100 percent of the company’s sales were
 in the U.S.   To contact the reporter on this story:
