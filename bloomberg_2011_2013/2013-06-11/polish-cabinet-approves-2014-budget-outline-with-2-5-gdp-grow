Poland approved the outline of its
2014 budget, which assumes the European Union’s largest eastern
economy will expand 2.5 percent.  The Cabinet agreed to allow a wider fiscal deficit of as
much as 55 billion zloty ($17.1 billion), compared with 35.6
billion zloty this year, according a statement e-mailed today.
Inflation will average 2.4 percent in 2014, while unemployment
will be 13.8 percent.  “Our forecasts are rather restrained and cautious,” Prime
Minister Donald Tusk told a news conference after the government
met in Warsaw. “Economic  growth  of about 2.5 percent seems
probable.”  Poland’s economy is poised to expand 1.5 percent this year,
its slowest pace since 2002, as the 17-nation euro area remains
stuck in a record-long recession, the  Finance Ministry  predicts.
The central bank has cut  interest rates  by 2 percentage points
since November to support flagging growth, with policy makers
reducing the benchmark to a record-low 2.75 percent on June 5.  The government is considering revising this year’s budget
to “to find ways to make 2013 less painful” for the public,
possibly through cuts in  defense spending , according to Tusk.
The revision may come “this summer,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
