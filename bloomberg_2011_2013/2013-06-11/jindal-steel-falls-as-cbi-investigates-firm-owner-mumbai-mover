Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP) ,  India ’s
 third-largest steelmaker  by value, headed for the biggest
decline in 5 1/2 years in Mumbai as the nation’s top
investigating agency registered a case related to allocation of
coal blocks against the company and its owner Naveen Jindal.  The  shares  fell as much as 24 percent, the most since Jan.
21, 2008, to 202 rupees and traded at 218 rupees as of 12:01 p.m.
local time. The stock has fallen 51 percent this year, compared
with a 1.4 percent decline in the benchmark S&P BSE  Sensex. (SENSEX)   Investigations are being carried out in several offices of
Jindal Steel, including its New Delhi headquarters, as well as
Naveen Jindal’s residence in the capital, Central Bureau of
Investigation spokeswoman Dharini Mishra said today in a text
message.  “This is an ongoing CBI investigation into coal block
allocation,” Manu Kapoor, the head of external affairs at
 Jindal Steel , said in an e-mailed statement. “At this stage of
the investigation, JSPL is committed to fully cooperate with the
CBI.”  The CBI is probing companies after the nation’s auditor in
August said the allocation of coal mines without an auction had
cost the government 1.86 trillion rupees ($32 billion). The
Comptroller & Auditor General of India said the award of the
mines gave undue benefit to companies including Jindal Steel.  Jindal, who is a member of the ruling Indian National
Congress, couldn’t be immediately reached on his cellphone or
his landline phones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
