I recently served as a mentor at a hackathon and came away shaking my head.  In hackathons, teams compete intensively, typically for just a day or two, to create software (and sometimes hardware) solutions.  What struck me was that most of the participants —  young, tech-savvy programmers, engineers, and others —  seemed largely uninformed or unconcerned about intellectual property.  Participants tend to come from many different organizations, and often view hackathons as recreational social events, so perhaps they can be forgiven for not focusing on IP.  But the companies they come from need to pay attention — or risk losing valuable IP. Hackathons have tremendous potential to create disruptive technologies, attract young talent, and identify leaders.  Twitter and GroupMe both originated in hackathons.  A savvy, forward-thinking business might therefore run its own hackathons internally.  Whatever inventions come out of an internal hackathon are clearly owned by the firm and go into its win column. But suppose those same creative, talented employees like to relax by participating in public, external hackathons. They are going to form teams with people they may have never met before, brainstorm together, generate at least a proof-of-concept prototype product, and then publically disclose it, all in the course of one weekend.  The disclosure may torpedo any chance of patenting, at least outside the US, whatever they invent.  Short of that, it may be unclear who contributed what, and who has proper claim to the invention. So in addition to, or in lieu of, running internal hackathons, a savvy business will take a proactive approach to its employees' participation in external hackathons. One option is simply to prohibit employees from participating in external hackathons.  This approach probably makes the most sense for certain types of businesses, such as those concerned with software development.  But for many businesses the danger of such a strict policy is that it can alienate talented employees interested in participating in hackathons on their own time.   An alternative is to be proactive and reasonably liberal about employees' participation in external hackthons while still managing potential IP risks and opportunities of the business.  For example: Prior to participation Following participation Internal hackathons may be one way to focus and exploit, in a highly productive way, the phenomenon of "stealth innovation" —  in which employees develop solutions to problems outside of formal channels.  See the HBR blogs " The Case for Stealth Innovation " and " Stealth Innovation Is Not a Solution ." This approach is attractive and rewarding for both the organization and its innovator employees.  The message of internal hackathons is: We're interested in what you are thinking and we value your creative drive. The challenge is to maintain such goodwill when it comes to managing participation in external hackathons.  Whereas internal  hackathons may generate a credit in goodwill for employees who are forbidden to participate in outside hackathons, if internal hackathons are not feasible, then a well-thought-out and well-communicated hackathon policy is crucial to managing corporate intellectual property interests and employee relations.
