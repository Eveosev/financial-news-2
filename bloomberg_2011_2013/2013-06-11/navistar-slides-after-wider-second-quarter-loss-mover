Navistar International Corp. (NAV)  fell
the most in 10 months after the maker of International trucks
and MaxxForce engines reported a wider quarterly loss.  The  shares  slid 9.1 percent to $31.20 at the close in  New
York , the biggest one-day decline since Aug. 2. Navistar has
climbed 43 percent this year, compared with a 14 percent gain
for the Russell 1000 Index.  Navistar yesterday posted a fiscal second-quarter net loss
of $374 million, compared with a deficit of $172 million a year
earlier. Excluding discontinued operations, the per-share loss
for the period ended April 30 widened to $4.39 from $2.01 a year
earlier. The average of 14 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was for a loss of $1.20 a share.  Chief Executive Officer Troy Clarke, who assumed the top
post at the Lisle, Illinois-based company in April, is trying to
end losses, installing his executive team and selling off units
not part of Navistarâ€™s main truck business. The company last
month sold its recreational-vehicle business to Allied Specialty
Vehicles Inc. for an undisclosed amount.  The truckmaker cited lower sales and higher warranty
costs for engines that failed to meet 2010 federal emission
standards for the quarterly deficit. Revenue fell 23 percent to
$2.53 billion. The results were released after the end of
regular trading yesterday in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
