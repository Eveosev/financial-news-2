The European Union proposed an EU-wide system to allow damages claims from price-fixing victims,
in a move that stops short of forcing nations to allow group
lawsuits.  Proposals on private enforcement actions will seek to
remove practical difficulties that victims frequently face when
they try to receive a fair compensation for the damage they have
suffered, the European Commission said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “The right to claim compensation before national courts
exists in all EU member states but businesses and citizens are
not always able to exercise it in practice,” Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, said in the statement today.
“Today’s proposal seeks to remove these obstacles.”  Private-damages lawsuits are rare in national courts across
Europe. The Brussels-based European Commission has championed
such lawsuits as a way to compensate victims of illegal
monopolies and cartels ranging from plots to fix air-cargo fuel
and security surcharges to the price of television tubes.  Under the plans, national courts will have the power to
order companies to disclose evidence when victims claim
compensation, the commission said.  The commission would also set out “non-binding
principles” for group lawsuits, also known as collective
redress, according to a separate statement on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
