The  surplus  of tankers competing to
ship 2 million-barrel oil cargoes from ports in the Persian Gulf
expanded for a second week, according to a Bloomberg News survey
of shipbrokers.  There are 18 percent more very large crude carriers seeking
charters over the next 30 days than probable shipments in the
world’s largest cargo-loading region, the median in the survey
of four shipbrokers and two owners showed today. The excess last
week was 13 percent.  The VLCC fleet’s capacity expanded 39 percent in the past
five years, according to data from IHS Fairplay, a Redhill,
England-based maritime research company. Seaborne crude-oil
imports will average 38.4 million barrels a day this year, 0.5
percent more than in 2008, according to Clarkson Plc, the
world’s largest shipbroker.  Freight rates for VLCCs on the benchmark route to Asia from
the Middle East slumped 0.5 percent yesterday to 42.06
Worldscale points, the sixth consecutive decline, according to
figures from the Baltic Exchange in  London . The Worldscale rate
equates to earnings for owners of $16,282 a day for the vessels,
according to the bourse’s calculations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
