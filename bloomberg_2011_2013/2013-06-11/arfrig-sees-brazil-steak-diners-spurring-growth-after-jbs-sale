Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3) , Brazil’s No. 2
beef producer, expects the arrival of international restaurant
chains from Longhorn Steakhouse to  Olive Garden  to drive sales
growth as middle-income Brazilians spend more eating out.  “Beef accounts for about 70 percent of protein consumed in
restaurants in Brazil,” Sergio Rial, who heads Marfrig’s Seara
Foods unit, said today in an interview from the company’s Sao
Paulo headquarters. “Of course people eat chicken and pork but,
unless they are vegetarians, on average what they truly prefer
are steaks.”  Brazil’s second-largest maker of TV dinners and frozen
pizza is refocusing on supplying beef cuts to restaurant chains
in Latin America’s largest economy after agreeing to sell
chicken and pork processing plants and a tannery unit in Uruguay
to  JBS SA (JBSS3)  in a 5.85 billion reais ($2.74 billion) all-debt deal
announced yesterday.  Marfrig, a supplier of hamburger patties to McDonald’s
Corp. and steaks to OSI Restaurant Partners Inc.’s Outback
Steakhouse, plans to gain market share in the food service
segment where margins are higher compared with supplying
supermarket chains, said Rial, the former Cargill Inc. chief
financial officer, who will take over from Marcos Molina as
Marfrig chief executive officer next year.  Sao Paulo-based International Meal Co. signed a Feb. 21
contract with Orlando, Florida-based  Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI) ,
operator of Olive Garden and Longhorn, to open 57 restaurants in
Brazil, Colombia, Panama and the Dominican Republic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
