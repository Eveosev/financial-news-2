Carlyle Group LP (CG) , the world’s
second-biggest manager of alternative assets, is seeking to
raise $4 billion for its seventh real estate fund, said a person
with knowledge of the plans.  The new fund would be the firm’s largest ever for property
investments, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the fundraising isn’t public. The Washington-based
company raised $2.3 billion for its current fund following the
credit crisis.  Carlyle is seeking to capitalize on demand for real estate
as 10-year Treasury bonds hover around a 2.2 percent yield.
Earlier this month, the firm said it agreed to sell 650 Madison
Ave., a 600,000-square-foot (55,700-square-meter)  office tower 
in  Manhattan ’s Plaza district, for $1.3 billion, setting a per-square-foot record for a U.S. office building.  Carlyle joins TPG Capital and KKR & Co. in seeking more
capital for real estate.  Lone Star Funds , the Dallas-based
investor in delinquent mortgages and other property assets, in
May finished raising $5 billion for a new residential fund, and
plans to begin raising a new fund for commercial assets.
Blackstone Group LP last year collected $13.3 billion of pledges
for the biggest-ever private real estate fund.  Randall Whitestone, a Carlyle spokesman, didn’t immediately
return a telephone call seeking comment on the fund.  The plans for the new fund were reported earlier today by
the Wall Street Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
