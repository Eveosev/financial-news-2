Dubai’s gross domestic product
expanded the most in five years in 2012 as the emirate, whose
economy collapsed after the global credit crisis, rebounded on
hotel and restaurant activities.  The emirate’s economy grew 4.4 percent last year, compared
with 3.6 percent in 2011 and 3.5 percent in 2010, according to
 Dubai Statistics Center  data. The sub-index for restaurants and
hotels grew 17 percent in 2012, while manufacturing expanded 13
percent. Wholesale, retail trade and repairing services, which
account for 30 percent of Dubai’s GDP, climbed 2.3 percent, the
data show. The emirate’s economy expanded 18 percent in 2007.  Dubai’s economy is rebounding as confidence in the
emirate’s ability to repay its debt is restored. Three state-linked companies paid or refinanced $3.75 billion of debt in
2012, in addition to a 3.3 billion dirham ($898 million)
liability that matured in April. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed  Al Maktoum , head of the emirate’s Supreme Fiscal Committee, said
the emirate is committed to repaying its debts, and will do
“whatever we have to do.”  Dubai almost defaulted in 2009, when its economy shrank 2.7
percent, after it borrowed more than $100 billion to transform
itself into a tourism and commercial hub. While the emirate
still has $25.6 billion of debt outstanding, the cost of
ensuring its debt has declined  125 basis points  in 12 months to
250 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Dubai’s borrowing costs have also declined, with the yield
on its 7.75 percent notes due October 2020 falling 170 basis
points in 12 months to 4.6 percent today.  The emirate’s GDP may expand 4 percent this year as the
construction and logistics industries revive,  Masood Ahmed , the
head of the International Monetary Fund’s  Middle East  and
Central Asia department, said in May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
