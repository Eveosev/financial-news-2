Iron ore will rally to average $120
a metric ton as  China  rebuilds inventories in the year’s second
half, rebounding from a decline in the next few weeks, according
to Macquarie Capital (Europe) Ltd.  The commodity used to make steel will fall for another four
to six weeks until China’s stockpiles bottom out between last
year’s low of a 17-day supply and a “critically low” 14 days,
analysts  Jeff Largey , Alon Olsha and Daniel Lurch said in an e-mailed report today. Stocks are already down to 21 days,
compared with 30 days a year ago, according to the report.  The benchmark price dropped 30 percent to $110.90 a dry ton
from a 16-month high on Feb. 20, according to The Steel Index
Ltd. New output trailing expectations in the second half and
Chinese demand will lead prices back to an average of $120,
Macquarie estimated.  “There could be four to six weeks of further weakness
until the China destock ends,” the analysts said in the report.
“Even without a robust restock, we believe the end of
destocking should return  iron ore  prices to about $120 a ton”
in the second half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
