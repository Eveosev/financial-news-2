Absent from the U.S. art scene for four decades, Martial Raysse, 77, is back in New York.  The wonderful show taking over  Luxembourg & Dayan ’s Manhattan space presents rare early paintings, sculptures, assemblages and films by the postwar French artist.  For “Tableau simple et doux,” which brings together paint, photo collage and neon, he draws inspiration from the mythological scene in Francois Gerard’s painting “ Cupid and Psyche .”  Also on view are some of the artist’s “things,” as he calls the papier-mache sculptures from his 1974 “Coco Mato” exhibition, named after hallucinatory red-and-white spotted mushrooms.  Prices are $500,000 to $2 million. Through July 13 at 64 E. 77th St.; +1-212-452-4646;  http://luxembourgdayan.com .
