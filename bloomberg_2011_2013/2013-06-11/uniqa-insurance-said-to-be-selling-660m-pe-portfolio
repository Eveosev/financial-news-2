Uniqa Versicherungen AG (UQA) , an Austrian
insurer, plans to sell about 500 million euros ($665 million) of
stakes in private equity funds to comply with new European Union
rules, three people with knowledge of the talks said.  Uniqa, which offers life, casualty, accident and property
insurance in  Austria  and central Europe, has hired Campbell
Lutyens & Co. to approach potential buyers, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the talks are private.  The company is selling the assets to comply with Solvency
II, a set of EU rules that will force insurers to match capital
reserves with the perceived riskiness of the assets they own.
Private-equity funds have an average risk weighting of more than
40 percent, making them one of the most expensive products for
insurers to invest in.  Lansforsakringar AB, a Swedish bank and insurer, sold 1.5
billion-euros of private equity fund stakes in August to a group
led by the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, a sovereign wealth
fund. Dutch life insurer  Delta Lloyd NV (DL)  said last month it will
stop managing private equity investments.  Turkan Koksal, a spokeswoman for Uniqa based in Vienna,
didnâ€™t respond to calls or e-mail seeking comment. A spokesman
for Campbell Lutyens in  London  declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
