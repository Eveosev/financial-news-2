Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, authorized the repurchase of
$1 billion in shares through the end of June 2014.  Management will determine the timing and size of buybacks
based on market conditions, the Newark, New Jersey-based insurer
said today in a statement. Prudential said it repurchased $150
million of shares under a $1 billion authorization that expires
on June 30.  Prudential, led by Chief Executive Officer John Strangfeld,
said it was identified by U.S. regulators as a potential risk to
the financial system this month. Prudential has said it may
contest the decision, which would increase U.S. scrutiny of the
firm.  “There is still some risk that share buybacks could be
constrained” for systemically important firms,  Jay Gelb , an
analyst at Barclays Plc, wrote in a June 3 research note. He
estimates Prudential will repurchase $450 million in shares this
year.  Prudential declined about 2 percent in  New York  trading
today to $70.93 and has advanced 33 percent this year in New
York trading.  MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life insurer, has
risen 35 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
