India ’s  interest-rate swaps  rose to
a one-month high on speculation the rupee’s slump to a record
will give the central bank less scope to cut borrowing costs.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said last
week the balance of payments is under stress and retail
 inflation  is still high. Ten of 18 economists in a Bloomberg
survey predict no change in the repurchase rate at a policy
review next week. Eight forecast a 25 basis point cut. The RBI
reduced the  repurchase  rate in May, March and January by a
combined 75 basis points to 7.25 percent.  “The recent rupee weakness reduces the probability of a
rate cut at the June 17 monetary policy meeting,” Barclays Plc
analysts including Rohit Arora wrote in a research note today.  The one-year swap, a derivative contract used to guard
against fluctuations in funding costs, climbed one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.25 percent as of 9:27 a.m. in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That is
the highest level since May 8.  Swaps have priced in a reduction in  interest rates  by a
total of 50 basis points, according to Barclays. “Should the
RBI pause, the next opportunity to cut rates will be July 30, a
long time in the current market environment,” it said.  The rupee declined 0.8 percent to 58.5775 per dollar and
reached an all-time low of 58.5825. It’s Asia’s worst-performing
currency over the past month with a loss of 6.5 percent. The
rupee will weaken beyond 60 in a sustained manner,  Rajeev Malik ,
a Singapore-based economist at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, said
in an e-mail.  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent government bonds
due June 2022 rose four basis points to 7.53 percent, the
highest level since May 13, according to the central bank’s
trading system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
