West Texas Intermediate crude
dropped as the Bank of  Japan  unexpectedly left a lending program
unchanged, bolstering concern that central banks are growing
reluctant to add more stimulus. WTI’s discount to Brent crude
shrank to the narrowest level in more than two years.  Prices fell 0.4 percent, moving lower with commodities and
equities, after BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and his fellow
board members refrained from expanding their tools to address
bond-market volatility. They stuck with an April plan to double
the monetary base as they seek to rekindle inflation and stoke
growth. Brent decreased more than WTI after production at the
North Sea’s Buzzard oil field resumed this week.  “Everything is falling across the board,” said Jacob Correll, a Louisville, Kentucky-based analyst at Summit Energy
Inc., which manages more than $20 billion in companies’ annual
energy spending. “Oil is moving with the broad financial
market. The market is watching Japan really closely as it’s one
of the world’s major economies.”  WTI for July delivery fell 39 cents to settle at $95.38 a
barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. The volume of all
futures traded was 2 percent below the 100-day average for the
time of day at 3:44 p.m.  Inventories Rise  Prices dropped after the American Petroleum Institute
reported that U.S.  crude inventories  increased 8.97 million
barrels last week to 396.3 million, the highest level since July
1981. Oil futures slid 77 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $95 a barrel
at 4:35 p.m. Prices were $95.25 before the API report was
released at 4:30 p.m.  Brent for July settlement dropped 99 cents, or 1 percent,
to $102.96 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Volume was 8.7 percent above the 100-day average for
the time of day. Brent was $7.58 more expensive than WTI, the
narrowest spread since Jan. 20, 2011, on a settlement basis.  The policy makers kept the BOJ’s one-year fixed-rate loan
facility unchanged after two days of talks. Twenty of 23
economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast that the central bank
would approve loans of two years or more. Officials were divided
before the meeting about whether to extend the loans to two
years, people familiar with the discussions said last week. The
BOJ has tapped the one-year loan facility seven times.  “We will discuss when needed” any extension to the one-year limit, Kuroda said at a press conference after the meeting.
“I haven’t seen the need for it so far.”  Markets ‘Nervous’  Japan is the world’s third-largest economy, after the U.S.
and  China , and ranks behind the other two nations as the third-largest energy-consuming country.  “We are not going to see additional stimulus from Japan
and the markets got nervous and started to sell off,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  dropped 1 percent. The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 1.2 percent. Japan’s  Topix index 
fell 1 percent after rising as much as 0.7 percent before the
BOJ statement. The  S&P GSCI (SPGSCI)  gauge of 24 commodities retreated
0.7 percent, led by metals and energy.  The U.S. raised its 2013 forecast for WTI to $93.25 a
barrel from a May projection of $93.17, according to the monthly
Short-Term Energy Outlook from the Energy Information
Administration. Prices will be $91.96 next year, down from the
previous month’s estimate of $92.25.  Buzzard Returns  The Buzzard field in the North Sea returned to
approximately full pumping rates of about 208,000 barrels a day
over the weekend after a halt June 6 because of an equipment
failure, according to two people with knowledge of the matter
who asked not to be identified.  Buzzard is the largest contributor to the Forties crude
grade, which sets the value of Dated Brent, the benchmark used
to price more than half of the world’s crude.  “The Brent-WTI spread has narrowed a lot,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital
Advisors. “Buzzard is moving things around.”  U.S. oil inventories probably dropped 1.5 million barrels
last week to 389.9 million, according to analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg before a report tomorrow from the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. Stockpiles reached 397.6 million
barrels on May 24, the most in 82 years.  Gasoline consumption  averaged  8.73 million barrels a day in
the four weeks ended May 31, down 0.8 percent from a year
earlier.  Demand ‘Subdued’  “Oil demand is relatively subdued,” said Rich Ilczyszyn,
chief market strategist and founder of commodities trading firm
Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “There is no reason for oil to be this
high.”  Oil advanced to $96.03 a barrel on June 7, the highest
close since May 21. It rose 4.4 percent last week, the biggest
increase since April.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries raised
crude output in May to the highest level in six months while
keeping its demand forecast for 2013 unchanged because of risks
to the global economy.  OPEC increased production by 106,000 barrels a day to 30.57
million a day last month, led by gains in Saudi Arabia, the
group said today in its monthly market report, citing secondary
sources.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
August was 20.2 percent, compared with 20.1 percent yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 516,102
contracts as of 4:37 p.m. It totaled 593,163 contracts
yesterday, 1.4 percent lower than three-month average. Open
interest was a record 1.81 million contracts.  -- Editors: Richard Stubbe,  Charlotte  Porter  To contact the reporter on this story:
