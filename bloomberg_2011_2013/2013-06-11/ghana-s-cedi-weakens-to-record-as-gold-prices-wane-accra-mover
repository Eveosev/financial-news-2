Ghana ’s cedi weakened to the lowest
on record as falling gold prices reduced dollar supplies from
miners and the central bank didn’t provide enough foreign
currency to meet local demand.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest producer of the
precious metal depreciated 0.3 percent to 2.0075 per dollar as
of 3:21 p.m. in the capital, Accra, the lowest since June 1993
when Bloomberg began compiling the data.  “The fact is that the central bank is not intervening
enough,” Sadiq Abubakar, a currency trader at Accra-based
International Commercial Bank Ltd., said by phone. “The inflows
we get from mining companies are not coming because the price of
gold is weakening.”  Adams Nyinaku, head of treasury at the  Bank of Ghana ,
wasn’t available to comment, said a man who answered a call made
to Nyinaku’s office and didn’t give his name.  Abubakar said importers are seeking dollars for raw
materials, equipment and  consumer goods . The central bank sold
$250,000 to his bank today, equivalent to 12.5 percent of the
demand received from clients, he said.  Spot gold prices have declined 18 percent this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The metal dropped as
much as 1.5 percent today and traded 0.7 percent lower at
$1,376.76 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
