Mexico ’s peso bonds advanced for the
first time in five days as the highest yields in six month
revived demand that had waned amid concern the U.S. Federal
Reserve could pare record stimulus.  Yields on local currency debt due in 2024 fell six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.51 percent at 4 p.m. in
Mexico City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The peso
increased 0.6 percent to 12.8320 per dollar after earlier
touching 13.1061 per dollar, the weakest level in 2013.  Mexico’s local-currency debt had tumbled as speculation
mounted that the Fed will reduce stimulus that pushed the
holdings of foreign investors, many escaping near-zero interest
rates at home, to all-time highs last month. That helped push
yields up 0.93 percentage point in the past month, while the
peso lost 5.8 percent in the period.  The Finance Ministry sold 4.5 billion pesos ($349 million)
in debt maturing in 2042 at an auction today.  The national statistics agency said today industrial output
rose a lower-than-forecast 3.3 percent in the year through
April, coming in below the median estimate of analysts surveyed
for a third straight month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
