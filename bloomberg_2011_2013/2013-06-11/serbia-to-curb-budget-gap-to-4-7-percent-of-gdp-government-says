Serbia will revise spending to limit
the  budget deficit  to 4.7 percent of economic output this year
as part of a broader program to balance austerity and growth,
the Finance Ministry said.  Spending will be cut by 40 billion dinars ($464 million),
mostly by reducing administration, while public wages and
pensions won’t be lowered, the government said in an e-mailed
statement, citing Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic . It said
members of the ruling coalition agreed on measures at a Cabinet
meeting in Belgrade today.  “Serbia needs faster economic growth than the 2 to 3
percent that we’re going to have this year,” Dinkic was quoted
as saying. “We have to reduce the bureaucracy so those who
invest and don’t need state help, can invest their money more
easily.”  Serbia seeks to narrow the gap after the  International
Monetary Fund  warned last month it may reach 8 percent of GDP
this year.  Standard & Poor’s  said the country may face a
downgrade without spending cuts.  Details of the program, seen as a “balance between
austerity in the public sector and stimulating development and
economy in the private sector,” will be defined on June 16,
followed by implementation in autumn, according to the
statement. Changes will include easier issuing of construction
permits and a more flexible labor law, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
