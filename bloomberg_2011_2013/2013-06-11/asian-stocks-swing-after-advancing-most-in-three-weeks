Asian stocks  fell, led by Japanese
shares, after the Bank of Japan kept its policy unchanged.
Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong headed for the longest losing
streak in 17 years as a gauge of companies outside Japan fell
more than 10 percent from a high last month.  Mitsubishi Estate Co. (8802) , Japan’s biggest developer by market
value, dropped 4.4 percent after the BOJ refrained from adding
to its purchase of real estate investment trusts. Emerging
market shares plunged in Bangkok, Jakarta and  Manila . Samsung
Electronics Co., the second heaviest-weighted stock on the MSCI
Asian Pacific Index, dropped 2.5 percent in  Seoul  after its
price target was cut at Morgan Stanley.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.3 percent to 131.36
as of 8:35 p.m. in Tokyo after gaining 1.1 percent yesterday,
the biggest increase since May 20. About three stocks fell for
each that rose. The MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index slid
1.4 percent to 438.03, taking its decline since May 9 to more
than 10 percent and meeting some traders’ definition of a
correction.  “Investors were expecting more” from the BOJ, said Koichi Kurose, chief economist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd.,  Japan ’s
fifth-largest lender by market value. “They are concerned
Japan’s economy will be hurt sooner rather than later as yields
rise and inflation expectations rise.”  Japan’s Topix index dropped 1 percent after the central
bank today refrained from extending the maturity of loans to
lenders it uses to smooth bond market volatility, bucking
economists’ predictions. Policy makers stuck with an April
pledge to increase the monetary base by 60 trillion to 70
trillion yen ($611 billion to $713 billion) per year.  Stimulus Outlook  The MSCI gauge fell 8.7 percent through yesterday from this
year’s high on May 20 on speculation that a strengthening U.S.
economy will lead the Federal Reserve to scale back record
stimulus. The measure  traded  yesterday at 12.9 times average
estimated earnings, compared with 14.9 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 13 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A gauge of consumer discretionary companies in the Asia-Pacific index  led  gains this year as Japanese shares rallied on
a weaker yen and the promise of policies to end deflation.
Energy companies had the biggest declines amid concern that
 China ’s fuel demand will drop as growth slows.  Regional Indexes  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 1.1 percent, led by
financial and real estate shares. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong
dropped 1.6 percent, heading for a 10th straight daily decline,
the longest losing streak since 1995. China’s equity market is
shut for holidays until June 13.  Hang Lung Properties Ltd. (101) , a Hong Kong-based developer that
gets 42 percent of sales from China, sank 3.8 percent to
HK$25.30.  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd ., the nation’s third-biggest lender, slid 1.7 percent to HK$3.45.  “There’s a bit of a slow drift due to a lack of
catalysts,” said Marco Li, a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager
at Manulife Asset Management, which oversees $238 billion.
“Economic data from China hasn’t been as good as people would
like.”  Thailand ’s SET Index dropped 5 percent, the most since
October 2011. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index plunged 4.6
percent and the Jakarta Stock Price Index retreated 3.5 percent.  “It’s a period of high volatility for these markets,”
Visit Ongpipattanakul, an investment strategist at Trinity
Securities Ltd., said by phone in Bangkok. “We should continue
to see more outflow of foreign funds from Thailand,  Philippines 
and  Indonesia  for some time. Concerns about the Fed tapering
have pressured the markets.”  Taiwan, Singapore  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.4 percent as the market
reopened after a holiday and a report showed home loans grew
less than expected.  New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell 0.2 percent. South Korea’s
Kospi index lost 0.6 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex Index gained 0.5
percent.  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index dropped 1 percent.  Japanese developers fell after the BOJ’s statement. The
central bank refrained from expanding its purchase of the REITs
after acquiring 138.4 billion yen of the trusts, near the full
self-imposed limit of 140 billion yen, according to the bank’s
data as of June 10. Mitsubishi Estate dropped 4.4 percent to
2,383 yen and  Mitsui Fudosan Co. (8801) , Japan’s biggest developer by
sales, slid 4.1 percent to 2,810 yen.  SoftBank’s Offer  SoftBank Corp. (9984)  dropped 0.4 percent to 5,500 yen after
rising as much as 1.8 percent and falling as much as 2.9
percent. It raised its offer for  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  to counter
a bid from billionaire Charlie Ergen’s  Dish Network Corp. (DISH) 
SoftBank will pay $16.6 billion to Sprint shareholders and
inject $5 billion of new capital into the target for a 78
percent stake, the Tokyo-based carrier said in a statement
today.  Samsung, the world’s largest smartphone maker, declined 2.5
percent to 1.389 million won. Morgan Stanley cut its earnings
estimates for Samsung this year by 1.6 percent as it lowered
sales expectations for the flagship Galaxy S4 handset to 61
million units from 71 million, analysts led by Shawn Kim said in
a report yesterday.  Futures on the S&P 500 index declined 0.3 percent today.
The measure fell less than 0.1 percent yesterday after its
biggest two-day gain since January, as investors weighed S&P’s
move to boost its outlook for U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
