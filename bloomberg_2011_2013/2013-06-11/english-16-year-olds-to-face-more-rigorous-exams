U.K. Education Secretary Michael Gove said the General Certificate of Secondary Education taken
by 16-year-olds will be changed from 2015 to place more emphasis
on examinations.  The change will only apply in  England , because other parts
of the U.K. have their own education systems. It will see the
current grades, from A* at the top to G at the bottom, replaced
with a scale from 1 at the bottom to 8 at the top, making it
easier to add higher tiers in future years.  The amount of assessment based on coursework, as opposed to
exams, will be reduced, Gove told Parliament in London today. He
said that would involve “more extended writing in subjects like
English and history, more testing of advanced problem-solving
skills in mathematics and science” among other changes.  “By making GCSEs more demanding, more fulfilling, and more
stretching we can give our young people the broad, deep and
balanced education which will equip them to win in the global
race,” Gove said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
