Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures dropped
amid concern the rupee’s slump to a record low will restrict the
central bank’s scope to cut interest rates at a policy review
next week.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for June delivery fell 0.4
percent to 5,882 at 10:01 a.m. in  Singapore . The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index dropped less than 0.1 percent to 5,878 yesterday.
The S&P BSE Sensex added less than 0.1 percent. The Bank of  New
York  Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares declined 1.5
percent to its lowest level since April 17.  The rupee reached its weakest level yesterday, weighed down
by an unprecedented current-account deficit, the slowest Indian
economic expansion in a decade and speculation the dollar will
gain if the U.S. scales back monetary stimulus. The Reserve Bank
of  India  meets on July 17.  “The rupee is the most important factor now,” Kishor Ostwal, managing director of CNI Research (India) Ltd., said by
phone yesterday. “The markets will dance to the rupee’s tune in
the short term.”  The central bank, which has cut the repurchase rate three
times by a total of 75 basis points this year, will keep it at
7.25 percent next week, according to 10 of 18 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. The rest forecast a 25 basis-point reduction.  Inflation Risk  Central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said on May 30 that
the depreciation of the rupee may stoke inflation and increase
the cost of servicing foreign-currency debt. Data to be released

June 14 may show, after a 4.89 percent increase in April, the
least since November 2009.  The Sensex climbed to a two-year high on May 17 as monetary

stocks on June 7, according to data from the market regulator.

for the period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Sensex is valued at 13.4 times  projected 12-month
profits , compared with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index’s 10
times.  Shares of  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the country’s biggest by market
value,  Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB)  and  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  may be active after

flouting rules, including those on money laundering.  Axis will have to pay a fine of 50 million rupees
($860,659), while HDFC was handed a penalty of 45 million
rupees, the central bank said in a statement on its website
yesterday. ICICI must pay 10 million rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
