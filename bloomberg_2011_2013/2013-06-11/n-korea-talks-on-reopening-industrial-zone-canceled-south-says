Talks between North and  South Korea 
scheduled for tomorrow to discuss the reopening of a joint
industrial park were canceled, South Korea’s Unification
Ministry said in a statement.  The ministry didn’t provide an explanation for why the
negotiations were called off. Yonhap reported earlier that
South Korea wanted minister-level talks whereas  North Korea  was
insisting that lower-level officials attend the meeting. There
had not been any official details on which officials from North
and South Korea would attend the talks.  Kim Jong Un, who succeeded his father in December 2011,
ratcheted up tensions earlier this year by threatening
preemptive nuclear strikes after the  United Nations  tightened
sanctions for a rocket launch in December and atomic bomb test
in February. He also shut the Gaeseong factory zone in April,
blocking South Korean managers and workers from entering the
area.  The joint industrial park generates about $100 million in
annual profits for the impoverished regime. It remained open
during previous periods of tension, including tests of nuclear
weapons and missiles in both 2006 and 2009, and the 2010 deaths
of 50 South Koreans in a ship sinking and the shelling of a
South Korean border island by the North.  To contact the reporters on this story:
