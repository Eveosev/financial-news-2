An independent  Scotland  should
continue to administer pensions and benefits jointly with the
rest of the U.K. for a transitional period, according to a
welfare working group set up by the Scottish government.  Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the
 proposals  subject to the government being able to reverse
benefit cuts it opposed. Sharing administrative arrangements
could last until 2019 until the Scottish government established
its own welfare system.  “A transitional period of shared administration would only
be in Scotland’s interests if it allows us, from day one of
independence, to address the inequities of the current system
and work towards a system that better reflects Scotland’s needs
and circumstances,” Sturgeon said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The welfare paper is the latest study published by the
Scottish government ahead of next year’s referendum on Sept. 18.
Independence is the cornerstone policy of the ruling  Scottish
National Party .  More than 10,000 people are employed by the U.K. Department
of Work and Pensions in Scotland. Two pension centers in Dundee
and Motherwell handle about 20 percent of all U.K. state
pensions and about 25 percent of pension credit claims. A number
of payments to Scottish claimants are handled by processing
centers in  England .  “Immediately separating these services would present
serious risks to the continuity of payments to people in both
Scotland and England,” the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
