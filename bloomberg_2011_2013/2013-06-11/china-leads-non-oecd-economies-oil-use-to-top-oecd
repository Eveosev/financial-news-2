Chinese and Brazilian oil demand
climbed in April, helping push fuel use by emerging economies
above the combined consumption from developed nations such as
the U.S. and Japan for the first time, a U.S. report  showed .  Countries that aren’t members of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development consumed 44.5 million
barrels a day in April, exceeding the 44.3 million from the most
industrialized nations, the Energy Information Administration
 reported  today. The pattern held in May, when the emerging
economies used 180,000 barrels a day more than the OECD.  “It’s a confirmation that the future of oil demand is not
in OECD countries,” said  Michael Lynch , president of  Strategic
Energy & Economic Research (SER)  in Winchester,  Massachusetts .  Global fuel-consumption growth will come from emerging
economies as demand from industrialized nations slips amid
increased fuel efficiency, forecasters including the EIA, OPEC
and the  International Energy Agency  have said. The IEA, the
Paris-based adviser to the 28 nations in the OECD, said May 14
that demand from emerging and developing economies would surpass
the OECD this quarter.  Fuel use grew by 0.7 percent in April in both China and
Brazil, the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm,
reported in its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook . Consumption
dropped 1.1 percent in the U.S. that month and 11 percent in
Japan. The U.S.,  China , Japan and Brazil were the world’s four
largest oil-consuming countries in 2011, according to EIA data.  Annual Forecasts  OECD members will use 45.5 million barrels of oil this
year, compared with 44.5 million from  emerging markets , the EIA
forecast. In 2014, demand from the developing economies will
rise to 45.9 million barrels a day, while OECD consumption will
drop to 45.3 million, according to the estimates from the EIA.  China’s consumption will rise to 11.1 million barrels a day
next year, up 4 percent from this year’s 10.7 million, the EIA
said. India will use 3.67 million barrels a day, up 3.7 percent
from this year’s 3.54 million. Brazilian consumption will jump
4.8 percent to 3.03 million in 2014, while Russian usage will
gain 3.3 percent to 3.48 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
