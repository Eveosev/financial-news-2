U.S. crude  supplies  probably rose
last week as production increased and imports rebounded,
threatening to erode prices after their biggest gain since
April, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Stockpiles increased 550,000 barrels to 391.8 million on
June 7, based on the median of eight analyst estimates before an
Energy Information Administration report tomorrow. Five
respondents forecast a gain and three a decrease. Inventories
surged to 397.6 million on May 24, the most since 1931.  U.S. domestic crude production reached a 21-year high in
early May and  exceeded  imports in the week ended May 31 for the
first time in 16 years, according to the EIA. Five analysts said
they expect imports to rise after the prior week’s 7 percent
drop, the biggest since March 1. The four-week  average  of
gasoline demand was at a 12-year low for this time of year.  “Production in the U.S. is still very high and imports
should rebound,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the
Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “Demand is still not strong
enough. We should see a build in supply, which would put
downward pressure on prices going forward.”  West  Texas  Intermediate crude for July delivery rallied
$4.06, or 4.4 percent, to $96.03 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  in the five days ended June 7, the biggest
gain since April 26. The contract was at $95.57 today. Futures
are up 4.1 percent this year.  Rising Production  The U.S.  pumped  7.3 million barrels a day of oil in the
week ended May 31, according to data from the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. Imports were 7.27 million.
Production had been lower than international purchases since
January 1997.  Output rose to 7.37 million barrels a day in the week ended
May 3, the most since February 1992.  “Production just keeps on coming,” said  John Kilduff , a
partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that
focuses on energy. “I am expecting a rebound from last week’s
big draw as imports rebound a bit.”  Imports fell 549,000 barrels a day in the week ended May
31, reaching the lowest level since Dec. 28. The drop helped
reduce  crude inventories  by 6.27 million barrels to 391.3
million, the biggest decrease since December.  Also expecting imports to rise were  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York; Tom Finlon,
Jupiter, Florida-based director of Energy Analytics Group LLC;
and  Jim Ritterbusch , president of Ritterbusch & Associates in
Galena,  Illinois .  More Fracking  “Imports should go up a little bit,” Finlon said.
“Demand is going to stay wishy-washy. As a consequence, crude
inventories will build.”  A combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked supplies in shale
formations in states including  North Dakota ,  Oklahoma  and Texas.
North Dakota output rose 58 percent in 2012, federal data
showed.  Rising oil production helped the U.S. meet 88 percent of
its own energy needs in February, the highest rate since April
1986, according to the EIA. Production has climbed 42 percent
over the past five years.  Higher production came as consumption remained below
seasonal norms. Gasoline demand  averaged  8.73 million barrels a
day in the four weeks ended May 31, down 0.8 percent from a year
earlier and the lowest level for the end of May since 2001.  “It’s not going to be bullish if demand continues to lag
behind year-ago levels,” Evans said.  Ramping Up  The median estimate showed that the refinery  utilization
rate  rose to 88.7 percent from 88.4 percent.  Philadelphia Energy Solutions started a unit at the Girard
Point section of its 355,000-barrel-a-day Philadelphia refinery
on June 7 after exchanger repairs, according to filing with city
regulators. The unit was shut for the scheduled work June 1.  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) ’s Catlettsburg,  Kentucky , refinery
restarted crude unit No. 5 on May 29 after it shut May 24,
Jonathan Barker, environmental inspector for state Environmental
Protection Department, said by e-mail. The plant has a capacity
of 240,000 barrels a day.  Gasoline  stockpiles  probably increased 500,000 barrels, or
0.2 percent, to 219.3 million, the survey showed. Five
respondents projected a gain and three a drop.  Regular gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, gained
0.3 cent to $3.635 a gallon on June 9, according to Heathrow,
Florida-based AAA, the largest U.S. motoring group.  Inventories of  distillate fuel , a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, probably climbed 900,000 barrels, or 0.7
percent, to 124.2 million last week, the survey showed. Seven
analysts projected a gain and one forecast a drop.  The EIA is scheduled to release its weekly petroleum report
at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
