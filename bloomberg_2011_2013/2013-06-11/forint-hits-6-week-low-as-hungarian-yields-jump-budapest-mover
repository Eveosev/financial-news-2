Hungarian bond yields jumped the
most since January and the forint weakened to a six-week low on
concern  Hungary ’s central bank may reduce rates further amid a
slump in global demand for riskier assets.  The forint depreciated 0.5 percent to 300.61 per euro by
11:02 a.m. in Budapest, the weakest since April 29. Yields on
Hungary’s benchmark 10-year bonds rose 36 basis points, or 0.36
percentage point, to 6.44 percent, the highest since March.  Hungary’s inflation rate was 1.8 percent in May, slower
than the 1.9 percent forecast in a Bloomberg survey, and within
0.1 percentage point of the 39-year low reached in April, data
from the statistics office in Budapest showed today. Emerging-market stocks tumbled to a nine-month low and currencies
weakened amid concern the U.S. Federal Reserve will reduce
stimulus.  “The overall inflation picture creates room for
continuation of the ongoing rate reduction cycle,” Zoltan Arokszallasi and Orsolya Nyeste, Budapest-based economists at
Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in a research report today.
“However, recent changes on the market including sharp
increases in bond yields and the weakening of the forint
indicate that the end of rate cuts is not far off now.”  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank reduced its benchmark rate to a
record 4.5 percent on May 28 in a 10th consecutive 25 basis
point reduction. The easing cycle may reach the bottom at 4
percent in July, the Erste analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
