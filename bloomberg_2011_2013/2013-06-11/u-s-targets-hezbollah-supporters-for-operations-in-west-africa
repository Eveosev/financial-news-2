The U.S. Treasury Department said it
sanctioned four Lebanese supporters of Hezbollah to limit the
organization’s efforts to raise funds and recruit members in
West Africa.  “As Hezbollah continues to use its global network of
operatives and supporters to extend its malign influence beyond
the borders of Lebanon, we will continue to use all tools at our
disposal take action to disrupt these efforts,” Treasury
Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David
Cohen said today in a statement. “These actions are
increasingly important as the funding from Hezbollah’s
traditional patron,  Iran , is squeezed by international
sanctions.”  The designations that Treasury put on Ali Ibrahim al-Watfa,
Abbas Loutfe Fawaz, Ali Ahmad Chehade and Hicham Nmer Khanafer
limit their ability to do business with U.S. citizens and their
assets under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.  According to the statement, they are responsible for
Hezbollah fundraising and recruitment activities in Sierra
Leone,  Senegal , Ivory Coast and Gambia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
