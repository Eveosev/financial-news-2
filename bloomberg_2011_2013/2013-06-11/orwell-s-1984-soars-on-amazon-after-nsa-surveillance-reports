Sales of  George Orwell ’s novel “1984,” featuring a futuristic totalitarian state, jumped on  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s website following reports of a classified program that lets the U.S. government collect personal data.  One edition of the book, which was originally published in 1949, moved to the No. 3 spot on Amazon’s Movers & Shakers  list , which tracks dramatic increases in sales volume over a 24-hour period. That made it the 100th-best-selling book on the site late yesterday, an increase from its previous rank of 11,855.  The sales gains come after the revelation of a top-secret electronic-surveillance program that allows the National Security Agency and the  Federal Bureau of Investigation  to access data from audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents and connection logs from the biggest U.S. Internet companies. The  Washington Post  and the U.K.-based Guardian reported the program’s existence last week.  Orwell’s novel portrays a dystopian society where individuals are monitored through ubiquitous television screens and overseen by a leader called  Big Brother .  Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS)  has seen a “significant spike in sales recently as government surveillance and Orwell have been paired in the news,” even though the book is consistently a top seller, said Patricia Bostelman, vice president of marketing at the bookseller.  The U.S. government program, code-named PRISM, traces its roots to warrantless domestic-surveillance efforts under former President  George W. Bush . The companies include Microsoft Corp., Google Inc.,  Facebook Inc (FB) ., Apple Inc. and Yahoo! Inc., the Post report said, citing a slide presentation.  Multiple Editions  On Amazon, another publication of “1984” jumped to 179th from 626th, while a separate edition including “Animal Farm” - - another Orwell work -- along with “1984” reached 228th on the list, up from 656th.  At the  Strand Book Store  in  New York , sales of the novel have increased more than 50 percent from an average of about 12 copies a week, according to Carson Moss, a buyer for the store. He attributed the increase to the reports of NSA spying as well as the prospect that the book was included on schools’ summer-reading lists.  None of the booksellers disclose statistics on who is buying the books.
