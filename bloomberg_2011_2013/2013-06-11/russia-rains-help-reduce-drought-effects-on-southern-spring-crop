Warm temperatures and showers helped
spring grains to resume development in  Russia ’s southern
regions, the main export-oriented area, after dryness last
month, according to the state  weather center .  Spring grains entered the maturation stage in the Southern
and North Caucasus Federal Districts in the first 10 days of
June helped by rains, the weather center said today on its
website. The two districts accounted for about 35 percent of the
national crop in 2012, according to the state statistics data.  Rains came too late to reduce the impact of drought on
winter grains and air humidity “restricted” maturation of
winter crops, according to the center. “That is why there was
no significant improvement of conditions for these plants,” it
said.  Rains were insufficient to eliminate drought conditions for
crops in some areas of Rostov, Astrakhan, Kalmykia, Stavropol
and Krasnodar regions in the two federal districts, it said.
Drought also affected crops in some fields in the Saratov,
Samara and Orenburg areas of the Volga Federal District so far
this month, the center said. Volga accounted for about 21
percent of the national crop last year, state data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
