Part of a concourse at Atlanta’s
airport, the world’s busiest, was evacuated after an electrical
transformer exploded in a gate area undergoing construction.  The blast occured around 8:40 a.m. near Gate D 21 at a ramp
level maintenance shop,  Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International
Airport  said in an e-mailed statement. There was no fire and no
one was injured, the airport said. There is still a partial
power outage in some areas.  “There was an electrical transformer in the gate area that
was hanging down from a dropped ceiling” as part of
construction in the area, Michelle Mohr, a  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC) 
spokeswoman, said in an interview. “It overloaded and blew.”  There are no indications that it was terrorism-related or a
planned attack, Reese McCranie, an airport spokesman, said in an
interview.  Atlanta is the hometown hub of  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) , the
world’s second-largest carrier, and about 95.5 million
passengers traveled through the airport last year.  Southwest
Airlines Co. (LUV) ’s AirTran unit also uses Atlanta as a base.  -- Editors: James Callan, John Lear  To contact the reporter on this story:
