The Treasury’s $32 billion sale of
three-year notes may draw a  yield  of 0.575 percent, the highest
level since July 2011, according to the average forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 10 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary
dealers.  The notes, which mature in June 2016, yielded 0.575 percent
in pre-auction trading. The record-low auction yield of 0.327
percent was reached Dec. 11. The amount being offered today is
unchanged from the previous 32 sales of the maturity. Bids are
due by 1 p.m.  New York  time.  The May 7 three-year note offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 3.38, after reaching a record 3.96 at the October
sale. The average at the past 10 auctions was 3.55.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 30.7 percent at last month’s sale
after being awarded 19 percent of the notes at the April 9
auction of the securities. The average at the past 10 offerings
was 25.9 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 14.6 percent at
the May sale, compared with 16.2 percent of the securities at
the April auction and an average of 19.9 percent at the past 10
auctions. The record-high 26.9 percent was set at the February
offering.  Treasury three-year notes have lost 0.2 percent this year,
compared with a return of 0.6 percent in 2012, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The broader Treasuries market
has declined 1.5 percent this year after gaining 2.2 percent
last year.  The Treasury Department is selling $66 billion in notes and
bonds this week. It’s due to auction $21 billion of 10-year
securities tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year debt on June 13.  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the Fed
and are obliged to participate in Treasury sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
