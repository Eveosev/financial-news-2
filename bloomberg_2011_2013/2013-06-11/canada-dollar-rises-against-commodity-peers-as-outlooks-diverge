The Canadian dollar rose to its
highest point in almost three years versus its Australian
counterpart as traders speculated the North American economy
will lead global growth.  Canada ’s currency fluctuated against the U.S. dollar as oil
dropped as much as 1.8 percent before a report forecast to show
stockpiles fell last week in the U.S., the largest customer of
Canadian crude. Canada posted its biggest jobs gain in a decade
and the fastest pace of new home construction in 13-months in
May, while stronger U.S. data has sent bond yields higher. The
loonie gained versus the Aussie after  Australia  home-loan
approvals grew at the slowest pace in three months.  “The domestic data backdrop in Canada, when you compare
and contrast that to Australia, is very marked,”  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, said by phone from London. “The monetary-policy
direction is remaining much more favorable to Canada than
Australia, and to a lesser extent New Zealand.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is nicknamed, gained 0.4
percent to 96.06 Canadian cents per Aussie 5 p.m in Toronto
after touching 95.47, its strongest point since Sept. 2010. It
rose 0.4 percent versus the dollar of New Zealand, like
Australia a commodities exporter.  The Canadian dollar rose 0.1 percent to C$1.0189 per U.S.
dollar after declining as much as 0.6 percent. One loonie buys
98.15 U.S. cents.  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government bonds rose, with
yields falling three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
2.18 percent. The 1.5 percent security maturing in June 2023
rose 23 cents to C$94.00.  Oil, Stocks  Crude-oil fell 0.9 percent to $94.87 a barrel in New York
and the Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities dropped
0.5 percent. The S&P 500 Index of stocks declined 1 percent.  Crude stockpiles dropped 1.5 million barrels, or 0.4
percent, to 389.8 million in the week ended June 7, based on the
median of 11 analyst estimates before an Energy Information
Administration report tomorrow. Six respondents forecast a
decrease and five a gain. Inventories surged to 397.6 million on
May 24, the most since 1931.  “The Canadian dollar remains a high-beta currency, and
fluctuations in the oil price will always affect it more,” said
Eimear Daly, a currency market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd., by
phone from  London .  The Aussie fell against the majority of its most-traded
peers as home-loan approvals rose 0.8 percent in April from the
month before, versus a 2 percent rise forecast in a survey by
Bloomberg News. The drop boosted the case for the Reserve Bank
of Australia to cut  borrowing costs , which tend to debase a
currency. Australia’s key rate was trimmed one-quarter point in
April to 2.75 percent.  Employment, Housing  “Things in North America are a little bit better than
elsewhere,” Greg T. Moore, a currency strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said by phone from Toronto. “A stronger economic
recovery taking hold in the U.S. is good for the Canadian
economy,”  Canadian  employment rose  by 95,000 last month, the most
since August 2002, and the jobless rate fell to 7.1 percent from
7.2 percent even as more people joined the workforce, Statistics
Canada said in Ottawa on June 7. The same day, the U.S. reported
a high-than-forecast gain of 175,000 jobs.  Housing starts in Canada rose to 200,178 units at a
seasonally adjusted annual pace in May, up 13.8 percent from
April and the highest level since November.  The loonie climbed on June 6 most in more than a year after
Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz, in his first public
comments, reiterated his predecessor Mark Carney’s view that
rates will rise as the economy grows. Poloz will probably
maintain a  1 percent  interest rate for at least the rest of the
year, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Canada’s currency has gained 1.2 percent in the past three
months against nine developed nation currencies tracked by the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Index. The greenback added 0.5
percent. The Aussie dollar led decliners, dropping 9.1 percent,
followed by the New Zealand dollar’s 4.9 percent drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
