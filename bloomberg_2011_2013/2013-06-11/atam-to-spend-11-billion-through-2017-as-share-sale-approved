Latam Airlines SA (LFL)  will use proceeds
from a $1 billion share sale to help finance plane purchases as
 Latin America ’s largest carrier seeks to bolster its balance
sheet and regain an investment-grade  credit rating .  The carrier, formed from Lan Airlines SA’s takeover of
 Brazil ’s Tam SA last year, plans to spend about $11 billion
through 2017 to add 165 planes, including 59 Airbus SAS A320s
and 25 Boeing Co. 787s, Roberto Alvo, Latam’s vice president of
strategic planning, told shareholders today at the company’s
annual meeting in Santiago. The Santiago-based carrier will
retire 114 planes, he said. Shareholders voted at the meeting to
approve the capital increase, according to the company.  “We have to add a net figure between 15 and 25 planes per
year just to cope with increasing demand in the region,” Alvo
said.  Latam will disclose the sale price for the new shares in
the second half of August and plans to complete it by Sept 25,
Alvo said.  The company aims to regain an investment-grade rating in
about two years, Chairman Mauricio Amaro told reporters after
the meeting.  Latam had its  rating  cut by  Fitch Ratings  to BB+
immediately after the takeover of Tam in June 2012 and to BB in
March. The current rating is two levels below investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
