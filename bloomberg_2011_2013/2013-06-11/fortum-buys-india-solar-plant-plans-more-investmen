Fortum Oyj (FUM1V) , Finland’s largest power
utility, has bought a 5-megawatt solar power plant in  India ,
where it plans further investments.  The company acquired a photovoltaic plant that was
completed in northwestern Rajasthan state in February last year,
Matti Kaarnakari, managing director of Fortum’s India unit, said
today by phone. He declined to give the deal’s value or name the
previous owner, citing confidentiality agreements.  The plant, which was built using thin-film technology, has
been performing well with a plant-load factor, or the capacity
that’s utilized, averaging above 20 percent, he said.  Fortum plans to invest “tens of millions of euros” to
build a solar portfolio in India, the Espoo, Finland-based
company said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
