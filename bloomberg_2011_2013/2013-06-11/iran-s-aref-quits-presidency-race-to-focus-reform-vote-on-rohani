Iranian presidential candidate
Mohammad Reza Aref stepped down from this week’s election,
clearing the way for the other pro-reform contender in the race,
Hassan Rohani.  Aref said he left the campaign after receiving a letter
from former President Mohammad Khatami asking him to do so. Aref
served as a vice-president in Khatami’s administration.  Khatami “as the leader of the reform movement, said my
continuation in the race was not beneficial,” Aref said in a
statement posted on his website late yesterday.  “With the decision of Mr. Khatami, Mr. Rohani will be the
candidate for reformists,” Aref said on his Twitter  account 
today. “In the hope that reforms win.”  Rohani, a cleric who was a chief nuclear negotiator during
Khatami’s presidency, has been campaigning for more media
freedom and an easing of social restrictions. He has also said
he will seek to steer the nation away from the confrontational
path with the West that was taken by the incumbent, President
 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .  Another candidate, Gholam-Ali Haddad Adel, dropped out of
the race yesterday to prevent the dilution of votes for
conservative contenders, leaving six candidates to compete in
the June 14 election. Ahmadinejad is ineligible to run for a
third consecutive time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
