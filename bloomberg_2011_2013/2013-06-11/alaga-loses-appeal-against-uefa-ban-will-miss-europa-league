Malaga failed to overturn its ban
from European soccer competition for breaking  UEFA ’s so-called
financial fair play rules.  The Spanish soccer team, which is owned by Qatar’s Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Al Thani, won’t be able to play in next
season’s Europa League, the Court of Arbitration for Sport said
in an e-mailed statement. A Spanish team hasn’t been picked to
replace Malaga in the second-tier continental tournament.  Malaga, which finished  sixth in Spain’s 20-team La Liga ,
was handed the ban by UEFA in December when it owed money to
other clubs, the court statement said.  The club must also pay a 300,000 euro ($398,000) fine it
received from the European soccer ruling body, the Lausanne,
Switzerland-based court said.  Malaga repaid the debts during the court proceedings, the
court statement said.  UEFA, based in Nyon,  Switzerland , is seeking to bring clubs
in line with financial controls that aim to reduce debt and
prevent them from spending above their means.  To contact the reporter on this story:
