Russian lawmakers passed a bill
banning gay “propaganda,” RIA Novosti reported.  The legislation, approved today by 436 votes in the 450-member chamber, enacts a ban on “propaganda of non-traditional
sexual relations” among minors, the state news service said
today. The maximum fine for violating the law is one million
rubles ($30,800), it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
