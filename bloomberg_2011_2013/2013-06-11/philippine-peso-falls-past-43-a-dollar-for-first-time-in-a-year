The Philippine peso weakened beyond
43 per dollar for the first time in a year after exports dropped
more than economists forecast and unemployment rose. Bonds fell.  The peso has lost 2 percent since June 7, set for the
biggest two-day drop since August 2007.  Standard & Poor’s  raised
its outlook for the U.S.’s AA+ debt rating to stable yesterday,
adding to speculation the  Federal Reserve  will cut its monthly
bond purchases. Shipments from the Philippines slid 12.8 percent
in April, official figures showed today, compared with a 5.3
percent estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The jobless rate rose to
7.5 percent in April, the highest in three years.  “Exports have been wallowing, in line with what we’ve seen
in other Asian economies,” said Joey Cuyegkeng, an economist at
ING Groep NV in  Singapore . “That adds to the weakness in Asian
currencies including the peso. The S&P outlook upgrade for the
U.S. allows monetary policy some leeway.”  The peso declined 0.7 percent to 43.10 per dollar as of
10:29 a.m. in  Manila , according to prices from Tullett Prebon
Plc. The currency touched 43.23 earlier, the lowest level since
June 8, 2012. It has has weakened 4.7 percent this year.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, increased 26 basis
points, or 0.26 percentage point, to 8.1 percent, the highest
level since June 2012.  The yield on the 6.125 percent government bonds due
November 2037 climbed 10 basis points to 5 percent, according to
prices from Tradition Financial Services. That matches a June 7
level that was the highest since Feb. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
