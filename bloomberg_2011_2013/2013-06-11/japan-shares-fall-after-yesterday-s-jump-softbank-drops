Japan ’s  Topix index  fell, retreating
from the biggest advance in two years yesterday, after the  Bank
of Japan  kept its policy unchanged and the yen gained.  Property companies, consumer lenders and steelmakers led
the drop.  Mitsubishi Estate Co. (8802) , Japan’s biggest developer,
slumped 4.4 percent.  SoftBank Corp. (9984)  slid 0.4 after the Japanese
mobile carrier increased its takeover offer for Sprint Nextel
Corp. The Topix Pulp & Paper Index jumped 6 percent as Oji
Holdings Corp. soared 8.8 percent on a ratings upgrade.  The Topix fell 1 percent to 1,101.15 at the close in  Tokyo ,
after rising as much as 0.7 percent before the BOJ statement.
The index yesterday jumped 5.2 percent, its biggest increase
since March 16, 2011. The  Topix (TPX)  surged 48 percent this year
through May 22 on optimism Japan can exit deflation. The gauge
entered a correction on May 30 after dropping more than 10
percent from its May high.  “Investors were expecting more,” said Koichi Kurose,
chief economist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd., Japan’s　fifth-largest lender by market value. “The market has been volatile
and yet they look like they’re not bothered by it. Investors are
concerned the economy will be hurt sooner rather than later as
yields rise.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 1.5 percent to 13,317.62,
with volume 20 percent below the 30-day average. The yen rose to
as much as 97.79 per dollar after the BOJ announcement.  BOJ Policy  The central bank said it will keep its policy unchanged and
refrained from allowing longer fixed-rate loans to banks to stem
bond market volatility, even after spikes in Japanese government
bond yields. Twenty of 23 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey
forecast that the BOJ would approve loans of two years or longer
or said that such a move was possible.  The BOJ unveiled a plan on April 4 to buy more than 7
trillion yen ($69 billion) of bonds every month, aiming to
double the amount of cash in the economy in two years, in an
attempt to secure 2 percent inflation. Japan’s benchmark bond
yield has swung from a record low of 0.315 percent in April to
as much as 1 percent since the BOJ announced the policy.  The Topix has fluctuated an average of 3.7 percent daily
since May 22.  Historic volatility  is near levels not seen since
the 2011 earthquake and nuclear disaster.  Yesterday’s 5.2 percent jump in the Topix was the 14th-biggest since 1970, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Shares surged after the yen weakened, Japan revised up its
first-quarter gross domestic product, and the government pension
fund said on June 7 it would sell bonds to buy more shares.  U.S. Stocks  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
today. The measure closed less than 0.1 percent lower in  New
York  yesterday as investors weighed rating-agency S&P’s raising
of its outlook for  U.S. debt  and Chinese data missed estimates.  Oji Holdings gained 8.8 percent to 383 yen and Nippon Paper
Industries Co. climbed 8 percent to 1,340 yen. SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc. raised its recommendation on both companies to
outperform from underperform.  To contact the reporter on this story:
