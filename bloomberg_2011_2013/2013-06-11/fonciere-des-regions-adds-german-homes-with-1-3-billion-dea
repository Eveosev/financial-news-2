Fonciere des Regions , the French
property investor with a stake in 32,000 German homes, agreed to
increase its shareholding in the company that owns them in a
deal valued at 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) including debt.  FDR will pay for the stake with its own shares, the Metz-based company said in a  statement  today. After the exchange, FDR
will own as much as 62.4 percent of Paris-based  Fonciere
Developpement Logements (FDL) , from 31.6 percent at the end of 2012.  “ Fonciere des Regions (FDR)  is increasing its presence in
Germany, which features a solid economy and an attractive real
estate market,” Chief Executive Officer Christophe Kullmann
said in the statement.  FDR founded FDL in 2005 as a way to invest in European
homes. FDL owns 3.2 billion euros of residential property, with
75 percent in Germany and the rest in  France . In 2006, FDL
bought 45,000 German apartments from  Morgan Stanley. (MS)   FDL shareholders will receive six new FDR shares for every
23 FDL shares they own. ACM Vie SA and Covea Mutual Insurance
Group, which together own 26.6 percent of FDL, have already
agreed to exchange their shares.  The same offer applies to other minority shareholders who
want to participate in the exchange. The deal will be completed
in September, FDR said.  FDL was up 6.9 percent to 18 euros at the 5:30 p.m. close
of trading in Paris, the biggest gain since October 2009. The
company has a market value of 1.25 billion euros. FDR declined 3
percent to 60.54 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
