Below-normal temperatures may grip
the U.S. Northeast and Canadian Maritimes through mid-June, said
 Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LCC.  Temperatures are expected to be at least 3 degrees
Fahrenheit (1.7 Celsius) below normal until June 20, according
to Rogers, who’s based in Bethesda, Maryland. Seasonal weather
will dominate the rest of the eastern U.S. during the period.  “For the Midwest and East, a combination of transient cool
troughs and wet weather systems continues to hamper heat
efforts, with still some risks for short-lived warm-ups, but no
major heat concerns,” Rogers said in a note to clients.  Higher-than-normal temperatures in large population areas
of the East and Midwest can spur natural gas demand as more
people turn to air conditioners to keep cool.  Power plants  will
account for 32 percent of U.S. gas consumption this year, Energy
Information Administration data show.  The normal average temperature on June 16 in  New York City 
is about 72 degrees, according to  MDA Weather Services  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Boston, it’s 68; in Chicago, 70; in
Houston, 83; in  St. Louis , 77; and in Burbank, California, 70.  To contact the reporter on this story:
