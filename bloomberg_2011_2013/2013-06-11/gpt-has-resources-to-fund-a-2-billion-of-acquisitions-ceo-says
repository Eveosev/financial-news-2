GPT Group (GPT) ,  Australia ’s second-biggest diversified property trust, said it’s able to fund A$2
billion ($1.9 billion) of acquisitions and developments after
withdrawing its bid for part of rival  Australand Property Group. (ALZ)   GPT, which wants more offices and industrial properties, is
willing to raise the proportion of debt to assets to as high as
30 percent from 18 percent currently, said Michael Cameron,
chief executive officer and managing director of the Sydney-based REIT.  The property trust last month withdrew its bid, made in
December, for Australand’s commercial and development property
division, saying the two companies couldn’t agree on a price.
It’s seeking to increase the proportion of offices to 35 percent
of its assets from 32 percent as of March, and industrial
properties to 15 percent from about 11 percent, Cameron said.  “We have significant capacity, well over A$2 billion of
capacity,” Cameron said in an interview in Sydney on June 7.
“We do get invited to look at every opportunity that fits our
strategy, so we’re very active, but the discipline is being able
to say no to deals that don’t actually work for us from a total
return perspective.”  The company reduced its retail property weighting to 54
percent of all assets from 61 percent following the sale of its
50 percent share in Erina Fair shopping center in New South
Wales state for A$397.1 million last month.  GPT is unlikely to follow other REITs that have issued
shares to fund expansion, Cameron said.  Stockland, Mirvac  Stockland and  Mirvac Group (MGR) , Australia’s biggest and third-biggest diversified real estate trusts respectively, each raised
A$400 million last month to buy new properties, fund
developments and repay debt. Other REITs including  Cromwell
Property Group (CMW)  and Generation Healthcare REIT, which invests in
medical properties and aged care centers, have also issued
shares to buy properties.  “With gearing at 18 percent and a significant level of
capacity, you could assume that, as we sit today, we don’t have
any current plans” to raise additional capital to buy or
develop assets, he said.  GPT has about A$80 million of vacant land that it plans to
develop into logistics properties once it achieves the required
levels of pre-commitments from potential tenants, Cameron said.  It’s  close to a deal  with Rand Refrigerated Logistics for a
cold storage facility worth close to A$100 million in Sydney,
the Australian Financial Review reported today. Brett Zarb, a
GPT spokesman, declined to comment on the report.  Brisbane, Sydney and Perth were among the world’s 10 most
 expensive cities  for industrial property rents in the three
months ended March 31, figures from broker CBRE Group Inc. show.  The company also plans to create new funds including an one
for industrial properties and another targeting individual
investors to expand, Cameron said. It aims to reach its targeted
weightings for its own office and industrial properties before
setting up new funds, Cameron said.  GPT  shares  rose 1.1 percent to A$3.76 at the close of
trading in Sydney, extending gains this year to 2.2 percent. The
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index added 0.4 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
