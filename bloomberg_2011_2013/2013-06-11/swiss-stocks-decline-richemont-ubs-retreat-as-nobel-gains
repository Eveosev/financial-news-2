Swiss stocks  fell, in line with
declines elsewhere in Europe, as the Bank of Japan refrained
from expanding stimulus and a German court began hearings on the
European Central Bank’s bond-buying plan.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the owner of the Cartier
brand, posted the biggest drop on the benchmark  Swiss Market
Index. (SMI)   UBS AG (UBSN)  and Credit Suisse Group AG, Switzerland’s two
largest banks, also retreated.  The SMI slid 0.7 percent to 7,735.98 at 9:29 a.m. in
Zurich. The equity benchmark has pared this year’s gains to 13
percent, from as much as 23 percent on May 22, as concern grew
that the  Federal Reserve  may reduce the size of its bond
purchases. The broader  Swiss Performance Index (SPI)  lost 0.6 percent
today.  Bank of Japan policy makers today refrained from expanding
their tools to address bond-market volatility, sticking with an
April plan to double the monetary base as they seek to rekindle
inflation and stoke growth. Germany’s constitutional court will
consider today a case against the ECB’s Outright Monetary
Transactions program.  Richemont fell 1.5 percent to 83.30 Swiss francs. UBS
dropped 1.2 percent to 16.66 francs. Credit Suisse lost 0.5
percent to 26.98 francs.  Nobel Biocare Holding AG (NOBN)  advanced 0.8 percent to 12.60
francs. The maker of dental prosthetics said it expects to grow
at least in line with market in the next three to five years,
assuming demand improves after this year “to modest mid single-digit growth.” The company added in a statement that it
forecasts profit margins to widen between 50 basis points and
100 points a year at constant exchange rates in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
