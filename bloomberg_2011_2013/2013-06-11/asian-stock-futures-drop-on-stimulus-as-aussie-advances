Asian equity futures followed U.S.
stocks lower as Treasury yields rose and investors weighed the
outlook for global stimulus and economic growth. Crude dropped
and the yen strengthened versus the dollar, while New Zealand’s
currency fell after the central bank said it was overvalued.  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  futures  slid 1.8 percent and Hang
Seng Index  contracts  fell 0.6 percent after a holiday in Hong
Kong yesterday. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures rose less
than 0.1 percent after the gauge retreated a third day in New
York. Ten-year Treasury yields approached a 14-month high as the
U.S. sold notes at the highest yield since 2011. The so-called
kiwi lost 0.5 percent after Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor
Graeme Wheeler said the currency is too strong and left
benchmark interest rates at a record low.  More than $2.5 trillion has been erased from the value of
global equities since Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
said May 22 that the Fed could scale back stimulus efforts
should employment show “sustainable improvement.” U.S. jobless
claims held at 346,000 in the week to June 8, according to the
median of 51 estimates compiled by Bloomberg before a report
tomorrow. Bolstering prospects for the euro region, data
yesterday showed industrial output unexpectedly rose in April.  “You have this tug-of-war in the valuation of
securities,” Rex Macey, who helps oversee $20 billion as chief
investment officer at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors in
Atlanta, said in a phone interview. “You’re getting this
attention between what I’d call optimism about higher growth
rates, which leads the market higher and creates higher
valuations, and higher interest rates, which pulls valuations
down.”  Rising Volatility  Futures (XPA)  on Australia’s SPI 200 Index also dropped, losing
0.8 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 0.8
percent to complete its first three-day losing streak this year,
while the S&P 500 slipped 0.8 percent in U.S. trading.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Global FX Volatility Index was up
1.2 percent at 10.68 percent, the highest level in almost a
year. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known
as the VIX, rose 8.9 percent to 18.59, the highest since
February.  Widening swings in U.S. shares have prompted options
traders to make unprecedented bets on equity volatility, pushing
bullish and bearish contracts to records amid concern the
Federal Reserve will curtail stimulus. Options outstanding on
the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN, tracking a gauge
of VIX futures, climbed to an all-time high of 3.46 million June
6, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  New Zealand  The kiwi weakened to 79.49 U.S. cents, posting the steepest
decline among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, as
Governor Wheeler said policy makers expect to keep the Official
Cash Rate unchanged at 2.5 percent through the end of 2013. New
Zealand’s currency is down 4.1 percent versus the greenback this
year after Wheeler said last month the central bank is prepared
to step up intervention to weaker the kiwi.  Australia ’s dollar fell 0.2 percent to 94.66 U.S. cents,
while the yen gained 0.2 percent to 95.79, the strongest level
on a closing basis since April 3. The Dollar Index lost 0.2
percent yesterday to 80.97, the lowest level since February.  Crude oil  dropped 0.2 percent to $95.73 a barrel, after
rising to $95.88 in New York amid concern Middle Eastern
tensions are intensifying and as the dollar weakened.  Greek Declines  The ASE Index sank 3.2 percent in  Athens  as  Greece  became
the first developed nation cut to emerging-market status by MSCI
Inc. The drop took the measure to its lowest level in two
months. MSCI, which runs equity gauges tracked by investors with
about $7 trillion in assets, downgraded Greece to an emerging
market after the  ASE (ASE) ’s 83 percent plunge since 2007.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.4 percent yesterday,
reversing an earlier advance of as much as 0.7 percent and
sliding to the lowest level since April 22 as auto and
construction companies led losses. The VStoxx Index, the VIX’s
European counterpart that tracks the cost the Euro Stoxx 50
Index options, advanced 3.5 percent to 21.74 and is up 11
percent in two days.  Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries added four basis points
to 2.23 percent, while 30-year rates jumped seven basis points
to 3.38 percent, a two-month high on a closing basis.  Treasuries remained lower after the U.S. sold $21 billion
of 10-year securities, the second of three note and bond
auctions this week totaling $66 billion. The notes yielded 2.209
percent at the sale, the most since October 2011, versus a
forecast of 2.195 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of
the Fed’s 21 primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of debt
offered, was 2.53, the least in 10 months.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index was little changed at
954.38 after a five-day decline.  Brazil ’s  Ibovespa (IBOV)  lost 1.2
percent, falling to the lowest level since August 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
