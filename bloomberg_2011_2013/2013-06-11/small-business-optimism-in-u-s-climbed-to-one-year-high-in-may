Confidence among U.S. small
businesses climbed in May to a one-year high as the economic
outlook over the next six months brightened.  The  National Federation of Independent Business ’s optimism
 index  increased to 94.4, the highest since May 2012, from 92.1
in April. Eight of the measure’s 10 components contributed to
the improvement, the Washington-based group said.  The share of business owners expecting sales to increase
improved by 4 percentage points to 8 percent in May, and those
looking for economic conditions to pick up through the rest of
the year rose 10 points. Still, fewer companies planned to add
to payrolls.  “Pessimism about the economy and future sales did
moderate,”  William Dunkelberg , the group’s chief economist,
said in a statement. At the same time, “planned  job creation 
fell a point and reported job creation stalled after five ‘up’
months.”  The NFIB report was based on a survey of 715 small-business
owners through May 30. Small companies represent more than 99
percent of all U.S employers, according to the U.S. Small
Business Administration. A small business is defined as an
independent enterprise with no more than 500 employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
