Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  sold $41.4 million
of callable seven-year notes tied to  Intel Corp. (INTC) , the largest
such offering since January 2011.  The securities, issued June 5, yield 34.633 times the stock
price of the company and can be redeemed by the bank any time
after July 12, according to a  prospectus  filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank didn’t charge a fee
for distribution.  The  stock  would have to rise almost 17 percent from its
value at the time of sale to $28.88 to return $1,000, which was
the principal amount.  Intel may increase its market share in the mobile and
tablet market to 30 percent at the end of 2014 from about 5
percent now, said  Kevin Cassidy , a Washington-based analyst at
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.  “The manufacturing technology advantage that they have is
going to get Intel products designed into more mobile
products,” he said.  The brokerage lowered its 12-month target price of Santa
Clara, California-based Intel to $28 from $33 on Oct. 17.  Shares of Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor maker,
rose 21 percent this year to $25.01 as of the close of trading
yesterday.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  sold $100 million of one-year notes tied to
Intel on Jan. 4, 2011, according to a  prospectus  filed with the
SEC.  Shelley Beason, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo, didn’t respond to a voicemail and an e-mail seeking
comment on the note or the stock.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
