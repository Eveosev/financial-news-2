Gold futures declined to the lowest
price in more than two weeks on speculation that central banks
will curb stimulus, lowering demand for the precious metal as a
store of value.  Standard & Poor’s  lifted its outlook for the U.S.’s AA+
credit rating yesterday to stable from negative, citing receding
fiscal risks. Bank of Japan officials today left a lending
program unchanged, adding to signs that global policy makers may
step back from stimulus measures. Chinese markets are closed
today and tomorrow for holidays.  “It’s the stimulus story today,”  David Meger , the
director of metal trading at Vision Financial Markets in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Also, physical demand
is slow as the Chinese markets are shut.”  Gold futures for August delivery slid 0.6 percent to settle
at $1,377 an ounce at 1:40 p.m. on the Comex in New York, after
touching $1,364.50, the lowest for a most-active contract since
May 23.  Federal Reserve Bank Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last
month that the central bank could curtail its $85 billion
monthly bond purchases if the U.S. employment outlook shows a
sustainable improvement.  Gold Volatility  Gold’s 60-day historical volatility was at 28.8 percent
yesterday, the highest since December 2011 and up from 12.3
percent two months earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The metal tumbled 2.3 percent on June 7 after the
government reported U.S. payrolls increased more than forecast
in May. Prices are down 18 percent this year as some investors
lost faith in the precious metal as a store of value and an
improving U.S. economy increased speculation the Fed may scale
back quantitative-easing measures that helped bullion cap a 12-year bull run in 2012.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,  Australia ’s largest gold producer,
said last week it will write down the value of its assets by as
much as A$6 billion ($5.6 billion) after the slump in prices.  Holdings in  exchange-traded products  fell 6.1 metric tons
to 2,129.8 tons yesterday, the lowest since April 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Silver futures for July delivery fell 1.3 percent to
$21.646 an ounce in New York, dropping for the second time in
three sessions.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery slumped 1.8 percent to $1,479.90 an ounce, the
most since May 10. Palladium futures for September delivery
slipped 2.2 percent to $752.50 an ounce, the most since May 7.
Trading dropped 42 percent compared with the average in the past
10 days for this time, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
