Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) ,  Europe ’s
second-largest clothing retailer, said French designer Isabel
Marant will be the next collaborator for the 10th year of a
guest designer program.  H&M will start selling Marant’s collection for women and
men in about 250 stores and online on Nov. 14, the Stockholm-based company said in a statement today. The collection will
include clothing and accessories, according to the release.  “I aim at creating something real, that women want to wear
in their everyday lives, with a certain carelessness, which I
think is very Parisian,” Marant said. “You dress up, but do
not pay too much attention and still look sexy. The collection
is infused with this kind of easiness and attitude.”  H&M started collaborating with designers in 2004 when its
Karl Lagerfeld line led to mobbed stores. Since then, it has
sold collection from designers including  Jimmy Choo , Anna Dello
Russo and last November, Maison Martin Margiela. H&M uses the
temporary collections to drive publicity as well as sales.  The Swedish clothing retailer is trailing rival  Inditex SA (ITX) ,
the owner of Zara stores, which overtook H&M as Europe’s biggest
clothing maker in 2006. H&M said in March that it planned to
ramp up expansion, including more outlets for its new “& Other
Stories’’ brand, after reporting a decline in first-quarter
profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
