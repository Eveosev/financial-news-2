Legg Mason Inc. (LM)  may have one-time
“incremental” costs related to a review of the firm by a
third-party consultant, said Chief Executive Officer Joseph A.
Sullivan.  There will be a reallocation of resources to areas
including products and distribution following the review at the
Baltimore-based  money manager , which may lead to modest savings,
Sullivan said today at the Morgan Stanley Financials Conference
in New York. An update on the charges will be provided on the
firm’s next earnings call, Sullivan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
