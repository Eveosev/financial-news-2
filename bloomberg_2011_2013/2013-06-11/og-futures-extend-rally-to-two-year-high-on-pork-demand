Hog futures rose, extending a rally
to the highest in more than two years, on speculation that
demand will climb for U.S. pork exports to  China , the world’s
top consumer. Cattle prices jumped the most in a week.  Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd., China’s biggest pork
producer, agreed last month to acquire Smithfield Foods Inc.,
the leading U.S. hog processor. Last year, China was the third-largest buyer of U.S. pork. Yesterday, the wholesale  price 
advanced 1.5 percent to 97.92 cents a pound, the highest in
almost a year, government data show.  “It’s the rumors of export business that are helping
hogs,” Lawrence Kane, a senior market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group in  Yates City ,  Illinois , said in a telephone
interview. “The Smithfield deal certainly fuels the speculation
that China wants some pork long term.”  Hog futures for July settlement rose 1.3 percent to close
at 99.15 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after reaching 99.9 cents, the highest for a most-active contract since April 25, 2011.  Yesterday, the cost of  hogs  for immediate delivery at
slaughtering plants climbed 0.9 percent to 95.81 cents a pound,
an 11-month high, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  Cattle futures for August delivery increased 1.1 percent to
settle at $1.197 a pound, the biggest gain since May 31.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement climbed 0.9
percent to $1.44675 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
