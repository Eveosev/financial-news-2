Lal Krishna Advani, a senior leader
of  India ’s main opposition party, has withdrawn his resignation
from key positions healing a rift that threatened to damage the
party’s fortunes ahead of next year’s elections.  Advani changed his mind after leaders of the  Bharatiya
Janata Party  told him that his concerns about its functioning
would be addressed, the party’s president Rajnath Singh said at
press conference today.  Advani offered to resign yesterday, a day after  Narendra Modi , the chief minister of Gujarat, was appointed to lead the
party’s election campaign. While not directly mentioning Modi’s
appointment as the trigger for stepping down, Advani said he no
longer agreed with the direction of the party, which he said had
become a vehicle for personal agendas.  Advani was home minister and deputy prime minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government. Ahead of the 2009 elections, the
BJP projected Advani as its pick for premier. When questioned
about his political ambitions in recent months, Advani refused
to rule himself out as a contender for the country’s top
government office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
