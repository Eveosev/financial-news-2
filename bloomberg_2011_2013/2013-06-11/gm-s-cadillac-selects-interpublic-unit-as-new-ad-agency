General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac said
it selected a new  Interpublic Group of Cos.  unit to take over
the luxury brand’s advertising.  Rogue was created for Cadillac and will draw on resources
from Hill Holiday, Lowe and Campbell-Ewald, three existing
Interpublic agencies, according to an e-mailed statement by
Cadillac. Rogue will be based in the Detroit-area office of
Campbell-Ewald, with much of the creative and strategy work in
Hill Holiday’s Boston office.  GM said in March it would conduct an advertising agency
review for Cadillac. The account had been held by Minneapolis-based Fallon Worldwide and GM said at that time that Fallon had
been invited to participate.  The automaker is changing Cadillac’s advertising agency
amid an effort to boost sales of the luxury brand. Cadillac’s
U.S. sales surged 38 percent in the year’s first five months,
the biggest year-to-date increase since 1976. Detroit-based GM
is emphasizing Cadillac and mass-market  Chevrolet  as its primary
brands worldwide.  Interpublic Group, based in  New York , has been drawing more
business from GM. The company’s McCann Worldgroup gained control
of a joint venture formed last year to win GM’s Chevrolet ad
business.  GM declined 2.3 percent to $33.93 at the close in New York
while Interpublic Group fell 0.7 percent to $14.34. GM has
gained 18 percent this year and Interpublic Group has climbed 30
percent, compared with a 14 percent increase for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
