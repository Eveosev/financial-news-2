Bank of America Corp. , the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets, is regaining market share in home
loans after shrinking the business, according to Chief Financial
Officer  Bruce Thompson .  The company’s cut of the U.S. mortgage market fell below 4
percent after it shut a business that bought loans marketed by
third-party firms, Thompson, 48, said today at a conference in
 New York . The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender boosted
home-loan volume 57 percent in the year through March by selling
more products to existing customers, he said.  “We’ve been building that back up and expect to be in the
5 percent area as we exit the second quarter and look to
continue to grow from that,” Thompson said. “That share gain
is coming on getting what we believe is our fair share back.”  Bank of America, once the biggest U.S. mortgage originator
after its 2008 takeover of Countrywide Financial Corp., fell to
fourth place last year, according to newsletter Inside Mortgage
Finance. Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan , 53, has made
rebuilding that business a priority as he seeks to boost revenue
after booking more than $45 billion in costs tied to the
Countrywide acquisition.  The firm isn’t reliant on selling mortgages to  Fannie Mae 
or  Freddie Mac , the home-loan firms that have demanded mortgage
refunds in the past, because many of the new loans are
nonconforming ones that will be retained on the lender’s balance
sheet, Thompson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
