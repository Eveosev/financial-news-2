Ocean Thermal Energy Plc, a London-based clean-energy technology company, agreed to work with
French engineering company DCNS SA to develop and build plants
to generate power using differences in sea temperatures.  OTEC will build, own and operate the projects and raise
financing for them, the companies said today in an e-mailed
statement. DCNS will be responsible for engineering, procurement
and construction, according to the statement. Two initial
projects have been selected in the  U.S. Virgin Islands  and in
Asia, they said.  In addition to generation, the technology can make clean
water and replace conventional air conditioning, according to
the statement. The Virgin Islands project will include a cooling
system using cold sea water, they said.  While ocean thermal energy systems are able to produce
round-the-clock power and clean drinking water, there are
currently no commercial-scale plants in operation.  Lockheed
Martin Corp. (LMT)  and  China â€™s Reignwood Group said in April they plan
to build a 10-megawatt facility off southern China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
