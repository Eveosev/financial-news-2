Boeing Co. (BA)  raised its 20-year
forecast for commercial jet demand by 3.8 percent as air traffic
outstrips global economic growth and airlines refresh their
fleets with $4.8 trillion in new planes.  Airliner sales will total 35,280 new jets during the next
two decades, compared with a 2012 projection of 34,000 planes,
Boeing said today in Paris before next week’s  Paris Air Show .
Almost all the gain will come from purchases of the single-aisle
models that are the workhorses of carriers’ fleets, Boeing said.  Boeing is betting on the durability of that expansion as it
considers boosting output beyond the record pace already set for
narrow- and wide-body planes. There’s no sign of a bubble,  Randy Tinseth , marketing vice president for commercial airplanes at
Chicago-based Boeing, said in a briefing ahead of the forecast.  “Passenger traffic has been very resilient,” Tinseth
said. “Every indicator that we see in the market says that
demand is real and there’s a need to increase production.”  Sales may trail Boeing’s expectations if airlines and
lessors lose access to cheap financing and oil prices rise or
fall dramatically, two of the drivers behind jet orders in the
past decade, said  Richard Aboulafia , an aerospace analyst at
Teal Group, a Fairfax, Virginia-based consulting firm.  “We’re in a sweet spot where people can still make money
but have an incentive to replace their jets,” Aboulafia said in
a phone interview. “I don’t see that growth lasting
indefinitely.”  Paris Show  Boeing’s 20-year forecast is presented annually and gives a
snapshot of how the world’s largest planemaker views the global
commercial-jet market. The Paris Air Show, which begins June 17,
is the industry’s biggest forum for new-model introductions.  This year’s expo probably will net about $60 billion in
orders,  Peter Arment , a Birmingham, Alabama-based analyst with
Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc., wrote in a research note today. That
compares with $70 billion in orders at the 2012 event in
Farnborough,  England , and $110 billion at the last show in
Paris, in 2011, he wrote.  No aircraft at next week’s event will provide the same
sales jolt as Boeing’s 737 Max did in 2012 and Airbus’s A320neo
generated in 2011, Arment said in a phone interview.  ‘Healthy Amount’  “We expect a healthy amount of activity,” Arment said.
“We see the order activity for industry remaining quite healthy
not only in 2013, but in 2014.”  Boeing’s order estimate is more important than the
projected gain in value -- up 8.3 percent from last year’s
estimate -- because that tally is based on list prices typically
subject to discounts.  While new entrants such as  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) ’s CSeries and
Commercial Aircraft Corp. of  China ’s C919 will change the
Boeing-Airbus SAS duopoly in the coming decades, the incumbents
will retain their hold on narrow-body sales in the next several
years as the newcomers seek to establish themselves, said  Howard Rubel , a New York-based analyst at Jefferies LLC.  “I don’t really see that as a big threat in the
intermediate term,” Rubel said in a telephone interview.  Deliveries of single-aisle planes will be 24,670 over the
next two decades, 6.2 percent more than in last year’s outlook,
Boeing said today. Twin-aisle deliveries will be 7,830, 1.5
percent fewer than last year’s forecast. The largest planes,
four-engine jumbo jets, continue to fall from favor, with the
estimate of the two-decade total cut by 3.8 percent to 760.  Jumbo Jets  Boeing already has felt the crimp in demand for jumbo jets,
which it defines as planes carrying more than 400 people. The
company said in April it would trim annual production of its
747-8 model to 21 planes from 24.  Regional-jet deliveries will be 2,020, the same as last
year’s forecast.  Order backlogs running at double the normal wait time are
pushing Boeing toward further production increases. The company
predicts that 787 Dreamliner output will double to 10 a month by
the end of this year, and the single-aisle 737 will rise to 42 a
month in 2014, 33 percent faster than in 2009.  The world’s airliner fleet will more than double in two
decades to 41,000 planes, including about 6,000 older jets that
are kept in service, Tinseth said. More planes are needed to
carry an estimated 9 billion passengers annually at the end of
the 20-year period, up from 4 billion in 2012.  Boeing predicts that over the 20-year period annual average
growth for both passenger and cargo traffic will be 5 percent,
based on the number of airline passengers expanding 4.1 percent
and the global economy at 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
