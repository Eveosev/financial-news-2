Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNE) , a Calgary-based
oil company that operates in Colombia, rose to a two-month high
after saying it had started drilling a shale oil exploration
well shared with ConocoPhillips.  The shares of Canacol advanced 4.4 percent to 5,510 pesos
at 12:54 p.m in Bogota, the highest level on a closing basis
since April 1. The company was the best performer on the Colcap
index, which fell 0.6 percent.  Canacol said today that it started drilling an exploration
well at the Santa Isabel site in Colombia to test for shallow
oil and the potential for a deeper shale supply. Chief Executive
Officer Charle Gamba said in a statement that he was
“optimistic” on the the Oso Pardo 1 well.  The “shale opportunity is so enormous that it can’t be
ignored,” Christopher Brown, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity
Corp., said in a telephone interview from Calgary. The well
“will give us a good feel for how big the prize could be.”  Canacol will hold a 30 percent stake in the deeper section
of the site, with Houston-based ConocoPhillips controlling the
remaining 70 percent pending government approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
