Four Argentine farm associations
said their members will suspend grain and livestock trading for
five days to protest government agriculture policies.  Farmers will halt sales nationwide from June 15 through
June 19 to protest government policies, including tax increases
on grain and oilseed exports and currency-exchange restrictions,
Ruben Ferrero, president of the Confederation Rural  Argentina ,
said today at a press conference in  Buenos Aires .  “We’re tired of the current situation, which is getting
worse,” Ferrero said. “The government is indifferent to the
agriculture agenda.”  The strike deepens the dispute between farmers and
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s government in a
midterm-election year. Four months of farm strikes in 2008
produced food shortages throughout Argentina after Fernandez
tried to raise export taxes on corn and soybeans. Dairy products
won’t be included in the strike that starts this weekend.  “We want immediate solutions from the president,” Julio
Curras, vice president of the Agrarian Federation, said at the
same press conference. “This is the first step and we don’t
rule out future strikes.”  Argentina is the world’s second-largest corn exporter
behind the U.S., according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . The country is also the world’s third-largest
soybean grower after the U.S. and  Brazil .  To contact the reporter on this story:
