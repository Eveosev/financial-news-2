The bloodstained sock former  Boston 
Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling wore during the 2004 World Series
was auctioned for $92,613, according to Heritage Auctions.  Schilling, 46, helped lead the Red Sox to their first World
Series title in 86 years, pitching during the 2004 Major League
Baseball championship with stitches in his right ankle to
stabilize an injured tendon. Blood from the wound seeped into
his white sock, which had been on display at the National
Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, since 2004.  Schilling put the item up for auction eight months after
his video-game company, 38 Studios LLC, went bankrupt, leaving
Rhode Island taxpayers responsible for a $75 million state loan.  Schilling’s sock, worn in Game 2 of Boston’s World Series
sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals, was offered for online bidding
by the Dallas-based firm Feb. 4 with the high-bidder winning at
the live auction Feb. 23 in New York. The final price includes a
buyer’s premium of 19.5 percent.  Schilling had another bloody sock from his Game 6 win
against the New York Yankees in the American League Championship
Series, which was thrown away. The image of Schilling’s
bloodstained sock was transferred onto posters that hung
throughout New England.  Schilling retired after 23 seasons in Major League
Baseball. He was a six-time All-Star.  To contact the reporter on this story:
