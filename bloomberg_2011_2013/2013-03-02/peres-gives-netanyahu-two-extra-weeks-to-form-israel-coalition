Israeli President Shimon Peres
granted Benjamin Netanyahu two additional weeks to form a
coalition government as the prime minister urged heads of all
parties to show responsibility and join together in unity.  “We face huge challenges -- security challenges as well as
the challenge of managing a responsible peace process -- and
these challenges demand a joining of forces, not a division,”
Netanyahu said in remarks broadcast from the president’s
residence in  Jerusalem .  The prime minister, who last month added former Foreign
Minister Tzipi Livni and her Hatenuah party’s six seats to the
31 that his Likud-Beitenu ticket won in the Jan. 22 election,
still has to gain support from bigger parties such as Yesh Atid,
Jewish Home, Shas or Labor to reach the threshold of 61 in the
Knesset needed to form a government. Some of them oppose the
two-state solution advocated by Livni and the U.S.,  Israel ’s
main ally.  The prime minister has said he intends to have his new
government in place before President  Barack Obama  visits in late
March. Netanyahu indicated in his remarks today that
“boycotts” have been one of the obstacles in creating the
government.  “I have no doubt that, in light of the situation, we need
a coalition that can deal with very difficult security and
social problems as soon as possible,” Peres said in granting
Netanyahu the extension.  Peres gave Netanyahu 28 days to form a government on Feb.
