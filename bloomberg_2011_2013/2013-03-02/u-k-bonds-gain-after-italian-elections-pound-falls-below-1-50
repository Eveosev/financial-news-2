U.K. 10-year government bonds rose
for a second week, with yields falling the most in 16 months,
even after the nation lost its Aaa rating and as inconclusive
Italian elections boosted demand for the safest assets.  The pound slid for a third week against the dollar, falling
below $1.50 for the first time since July 2010, after a report
yesterday showed manufacturing unexpectedly shrank in February.
Two-year note yields declined for an eighth week, the longest
run since June 2011, as investors from Pacific Investment
Management Co. and Ignis Asset Management said Moody’s Investors
Service’s Feb. 22 decision to cut the U.K.’s rating to Aa1 from
Aaa was unlikely to affect the country’s bonds.  “On the evidence of this week, gilts still appear to
attract strong interest when risk appetite drops,” said  Sam Hill , a fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in
 London . “Markets have been more concerned about the next phase
in the euro crisis, following the Italian election result, than
they have been about Moody’s downgrading the U.K.”  The yield on U.K. 10-year  gilts  fell 24 basis points, or
0.24 percentage point, to 1.87 percent at 5 p.m. in London
yesterday. That’s the biggest drop since November 2011. The 1.75
percent security due September 2022 climbed 2.03, or 20.30
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,503) face amount, to 98.95. The  two-
year  rate slid seven basis points to 0.20 percent.  Italian Election  Gilts advanced as Italian voters rejected the austerity
program of outgoing Prime Minister  Mario Monti . pre-election
favorite and Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani won the
lower house by less than a half a percentage point, while ex-
Premier  Silvio Berlusconi  gained a blocking minority in the
Senate.  The securities extended gains after a report yesterday
showed a manufacturing gauge slid, missing analyst estimates. A
Feb. 27 report showed U.K. gross domestic product fell 0.3
percent in the last quarter of 2012.  The pound dropped 0.9 percent to $1.5030 after falling to
$1.4986 yesterday, the lowest level since July 2010. Sterling
fell 0.6 percent to 86.46 pence per euro after reaching 88.15
pence on Feb. 25, the weakest since October 2011.  Sterling has fallen 5.5 percent this year, the worst
performer among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, as speculation the  Bank
of England  will need to add more monetary support to the U.K.’s
faltering economy damped demand for the U.K. currency. The
dollar gained 3.1 percent and the euro rose 1.4 percent.  Asset Purchases  The central bank will keep its asset-purchase  target 
unchanged at 375 billion pounds when it announces its decision
on March 7, according to 28 of 39 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Nine forecast an increase of 25 billion pounds, with
the remaining two predicting increases of 50 billion pounds and
75 billion pounds.  At the Bank of England’s meeting last month, three policy
makers, including Governor  Mervyn King , voted to increase the
target, compared with one at the January meeting.  Paul Fisher ,
who also voted to boost bond-buying, said this week he favors a
more prolonged period of asset purchases at a slower pace in a
program that would be guided by the economic outlook.  The U.K is scheduled to sell 4 billion pounds of securities
due in July 2018 on March 5.  U.K. government bonds lost 1.1 percent this year through
Feb. 28, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds dropped 0.5 percent and Treasuries fell 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
