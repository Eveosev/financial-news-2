Baltimore Ravens quarterback  Joe Flacco  agreed to a six-year, $120.6 million contract, making him
the highest-paid player in National Football League history,
ESPN reported, citing a person familiar with the negotiations.  Flacco, who directed his team to the 2013 Super Bowl
Championship, is expected to sign the deal March 4, eight days
before he would have been an unrestricted free agent, ESPN said.
The 28-year-old surpasses New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who was the highest-paid player earning an average of $20
million per year.  Flacco is the only quarterback to win a postseason game in
each of his first five pro seasons, ESPN said. He also holds the
record for playoff road wins with six.  Flacco completed 22 of 33 passes for 287 yards and three
first-half touchdowns in the Ravens’ 34-31 win over the San
Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl. He was named Most Valuable
Player.  During the regular season, he threw 22 touchdown passes and
10 interceptions for the Ravens (10-6) who were first in the
American Football Conference North. Over 80 career games, he has
amassed 17,633 passing yards, 102 touchdowns and 52
interceptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
