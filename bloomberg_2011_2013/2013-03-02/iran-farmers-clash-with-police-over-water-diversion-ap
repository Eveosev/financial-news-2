Farmers in central  Iran  clashed with
police during a protest over the governmentâ€™s decision to divert
water to a neighboring province, leaving several people injured,
the AP said, citing Iranian media.  The semiofficial Mehr news agency said today that the
farmers agreed to hold talks with government officials to
resolve the dispute that flared during a Wednesday protest.  Farmers in the Isfahan province of Varzaneh smashed a
pipeline carrying water from Zayandeh Rood River to Yazd
province. The farmers said they need the water because of a
prolonged drought. Isfahan province has recently been the scene
of sporadic rallies over water rights, AP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
