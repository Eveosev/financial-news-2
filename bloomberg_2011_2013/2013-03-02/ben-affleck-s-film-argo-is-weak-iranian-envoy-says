Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s “Argo,” the
film about the rescue of American hostages from Iran more than
30 years ago that won the Academy Award for best picture, is “a
weak movie” and “insulting” to Iranians, the country’s envoy
to the United Nations said.  Ben Affleck ’s film about the aftermath of the Islamic
revolution contains mistakes, such as errors in the way people
address one another, that showed the filmmakers “were not
familiar with Iranian culture,” Ambassador  Mohammad Khazaee 
said in an interview with CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS.”  “I think the producer of the film, that is known as a
ambassador of peace, as I heard, should be ashamed of producing
such a film as that,” Khazaee said, according to a transcript
of the program, scheduled to air today.  Khazaee said he would like to invite  the producer and
director  of the film to come to Iran, and predicted that
afterward “they will apologize from the big nation of Iran for
producing such a weak film.”  Affleck directed the film, which he co-produced with Grant
Heslov and  George Clooney .  To contact the reporter on this story:
