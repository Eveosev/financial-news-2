Turkish Airlines (THYAO) , which has said it
will decide this month on the purchase of 100 airplanes, is
still in talks with Airbus SAS and  Boeing Co. (BA) , a spokesman said.  “The process continues, as talks with both Airbus and
Boeing go on,” Ali Genc, a  Turkish Airlines  spokesman, said by
telephone today in response to a report in German magazine Focus
that a deal with Airbus had fallen through.  Focus said that a deal to buy as many as 120 Airbus A320
had fallen through “for the time being” because the airline
wanted Turkish suppliers to be preferred.  To contact the reporters on this story:
