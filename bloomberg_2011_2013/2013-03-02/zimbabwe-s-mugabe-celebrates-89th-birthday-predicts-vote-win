Zimbabwean President  Robert Mugabe 
celebrated his 89th birthday with a vow to win elections due
this year.  Mugabe, who’s led  Zimbabwe  since its independence from the
U.K. in 1980, scheduled a referendum on the southern African
nation’s new constitution for March 16, paving the way for
general elections. His Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front party has ruled the country in a coalition with the
Movement for Democratic Change since 2009.  Mugabe and MDC leader  Morgan Tsvangirai , 60, have fought a
series of elections since 2000. All of them were judged by
observers including those from the European Union as having been
marred by violence, mainly against Tsvangirai’s supporters, and
electoral irregularities.  “We will win the elections,” Mugabe told thousands of
supporters in the gold-mining town of Bindura where public
celebrations were held today to mark his Feb. 21 birthday. “We
won’t win through violence. We want peaceful elections.”  Mugabe was presented with five cakes, one of them weighing
89 kilograms (196 pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
