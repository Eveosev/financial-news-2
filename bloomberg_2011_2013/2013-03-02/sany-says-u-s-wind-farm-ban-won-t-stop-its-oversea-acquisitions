Sany Group Co.,  China ’s biggest
construction-machinery maker, said U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s
September order blocking a planned Oregon wind-farm project
won’t stopped it from pursuing acquisitions overseas.  “We won’t give up any opportunity for mergers and
acquisitions and restructuring to strengthen the company,”
Xiang Wenbo, president of listed unit  Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031) ,
said at a briefing in Beijing today. “We expect more mergers
and acquisitions abroad.”  Obama on Sept. 28 ordered Ralls Corp., controlled by Sany,
to divest all of its interests in the wind-farm project that
consisted of locations near or within restricted Navy airspace.
The decision marked the first overseas purchase blocked by a
U.S. president on national security grounds in 22 years.  The multi-agency Committee on Foreign Investments in the
 United States , or CFIUS, initially barred the wind farm project.
Ralls filed a lawsuit Sept. 12 that challenged the CFIUS ruling
and then on Oct. 1 added the president to the suit.  U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in  Washington  ruled
last month that Ralls can continue arguing that President Obama
should explain his order though it can’t challenge his authority
to require a sale. Ralls may lose about $20 million because of
the ban, Zhou Qing, Sany’s in-house lawyer, said in October.  “We aren’t asking for the president to cancel the ban,”
Xiang said today. “We need explanations and compensation.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
