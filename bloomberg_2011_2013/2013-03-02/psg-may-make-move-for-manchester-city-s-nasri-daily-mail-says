Paris Saint-Germain may make a move
for Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri, the  Daily Mail 
reported.  Nasri’s future at City is uncertain after manager  Roberto
Mancini  criticized him in the press last week, comments which
angered the French national team player, the Mail said.  PSG sporting director Leonardo tried to sign Nasri when he
left Arsenal for City in 2011 and the Ligue One leader will
revive its interest after the season with Nasri said to be
“more than open” to a move, the newspaper said.  Nasri is making 170,000 pounds ($256,000) per week at City,
which would look to recoup as much of the 24 million pounds it
paid Arsenal, the Mail said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
