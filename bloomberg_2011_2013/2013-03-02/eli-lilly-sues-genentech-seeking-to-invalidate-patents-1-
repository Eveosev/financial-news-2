Eli Lilly  & Co. sued  Roche Holding
AG (ROG) ’s Genentech unit, asking a court to invalidate patents used
to make treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases and order
that its Erbitux drug doesn’t infringe the patent.  Genentech deceived the U.S. Patent Office into issuing
patents known as “Cabilly” after one of the inventors, Eli
Lilly said in a complaint filed yesterday in federal court in
San Francisco. Genentech claims that the process and certain
starting materials used to produce Erbitux infringe parts of the
patents, and is pursuing an “aggressive litigation policy to
protect its products against competition,” according to the
complaint.  Erbitux, made by Indianapolis-based Lilly’s ImClone unit,
is approved in the U.S. to treat  colon cancer  and head and neck
tumors.  “Lilly contends that it has no obligation to pay royalties
on the sale of Erbitux” due to the “Cabilly patents being
invalid and unenforceable, and, in any event, not infringed by
Lilly,” Lilly said in the complaint.  A phone call to Genentech’s media office seeking comment
about the lawsuit wasn’t immediately returned yesterday.  The case is  Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  v. Genentech Inc., 13-919, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
