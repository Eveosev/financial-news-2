Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Carl Crawford was restricted from throwing and hitting for a week
until nerve irritation from his elbow surgery subsides, the
Major League Baseball team said.  Crawford, 31, said the flare-up occurred after he started
to face live pitching in batting practice.  The Dodgers acquired Crawford, and his $100 million
contract, from  Boston  two days after he underwent the operation
on his left elbow. Manager Don Mattingly planned to use him on
Opening Day when the Dodgers likely will have the highest major
league payroll ever, topping the Yankees’ $209.1 million mark
from 2008.  “This definitely challenges the timing of it,” Mattingly
told reporters yesterday. “Instead of having four weeks, we’ll
have three. There’s still time. But I’d rather he came back
after 10 days or 20 days and have him healthy for a solid 140
games than have him in and out.”  Although Crawford can’t hit or throw, he still can track
pitches and run bases, Mattingly said.  “There doesn’t seem to be any panic,” Mattingly said.
“We’re still being cautious.”  Crawford said he plans to be ready for the season’s opener
against the San Francisco Giants on April 1.  “I understand there’s a chance I might not be ready,” he
said. “At the same time, that’s still a goal of mine.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
