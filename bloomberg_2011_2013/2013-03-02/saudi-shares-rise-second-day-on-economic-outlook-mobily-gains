     March 2 (Bloomberg) --Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index
rose the most in two weeks, led by  Etihad Etisalat Co. (EEC) , known as
Mobily, after better-than-estimated data on U.S.  consumer
confidence  and manufacturing yesterday.  Mobily, the second-largest telecommunications operator in
Saudi Arabia, climbed to the highest level in more than six
years.  National Industrialization (NIC) , the petrochemicals maker
known as Tasnee, jumped the most in two months.  The Tadawul All Share Index gained for a second day, adding
0.3 percent to 7,016.61 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh. The
gauge had the biggest jump since Feb. 16 on a closing basis as
69 shares advanced, 49 declined and 41 were unchanged.  “Gains in the market today are still modest and below
expectations and attributed mainly to telecom, petrochemical and
banking sectors for various reasons including the positive
sentiment in international capital markets during last week,”
said Mohammed Al-Omran, a financial analyst and president of the
Gulf Center for Financial Consultancy in Riyadh in an e-mailed
response to questions.  Mobily, gained 1.3 percent to 75.5 riyals and Tasnee
increased 1.4 percent to 29.1 riyals.  U.S. stocks  rose last week, sending the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  to the highest level since 2007.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
bourse operating on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
