U.S. stocks  rose for the week,
sending the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  to the highest level
since 2007, as better-than-estimated economic data overshadowed
concern over federal spending cuts and Italian elections.  An index of  homebuilders  climbed 1.5 percent as home sales
increased more than forecast.  Home Depot (HD)  Inc. jumped 5.3 percent
after it raised its dividend and approved a $17 billion share
buyback amid better-than-estimated earnings. J.C. Penney Co.
tumbled 21 percent and Sears Holdings Corp. sank 6 percent on
quarterly losses. Apple Inc. dropped 4.5 percent as Chief
Executive Officer  Tim Cook  failed to assuage investors seeking
more clarity on his plans for the company’s growing cash pile.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent to
1,518.20 for the five days, rebounding after its  only weekly
loss  in 2013. The Dow added 89.09 points, or 0.6 percent, to
14,089.66, the highest since October 2007. Both gauges gained in
February, as the S&P 500 climbed 1.1 percent for a fourth
straight monthly increase and the Dow advanced 1.4 percent.  “It’s been more of a continuation of the growth story, not
deterioration or that the sequestration was going to cause a
pullback in  consumer spending ,” Bill Schultz, chief investment
officer who oversees about $1.1 billion at McQueen Ball &
Associates in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania , said by phone. “This
market still has a bias to the upside right now.”  Equities tumbled on the first day of the week, giving the
S&P 500 its biggest drop since November, as Italian elections
spurred concern about prospects for a stable government and a
worsening of  Europe ’s debt crisis. Stocks rebounded as economic
reports showed purchases of new homes in the U.S. jumped in
January to the highest since July 2008. Consumer spending rose
even as incomes fell by the most in 20 years and American
factories expanded at the fastest pace in almost two years.  Budget Standoff  Democrats and Republicans are in a standoff over how to
replace spending cuts totaling $1.2 trillion over nine years,
$85 billion of which would occur in the remaining seven months
of this fiscal year. President  Barack Obama  said the automatic
spending cuts starting March 1 will be a “slow grind” on the
economy and that it may take weeks to win over enough lawmakers
from both parties to reach a deal on a replacement deficit-
cutting plan.  “The market is digesting both strong fundamental data when
it comes to the economy and then negative data when it comes to
geopolitical background,” Andres Garcia-Amaya, New York-based
global market strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s mutual funds
unit, which oversees $400 billion in assets, said by phone. “As
we peel away some of the layers of uncertainty and focus on the
fundamentals, we think the fundamentals are resilient.”  Bull Market  The  bull market  in U.S. equities is entering its fifth year
this month after the  S&P 500  surged 124 percent from a 12-year
low in 2009 amid better-than-expected corporate earnings and
three rounds of bond purchases by the  Federal Reserve  to keep
 interest rates  low and stimulate the economy. The S&P 500 has
climbed 6.5 percent this year and is trading at about 3 percent
below its record 1,565.15 reached in October 2007. The Dow is
0.5 percent from its high of 14,164.53.  Phone companies and consumer-discretionary stocks rose the
most among 10 S&P 500  groups  for the week, climbing at least 1.4
percent. KB Home jumped 4.8 percent to $18.77 and Lennar Corp.
advanced 2.5 percent to $38.84 as homebuilders rallied.  Home Depot gained 5.3 percent to $69.03. The largest U.S.
home-improvement retailer posted fourth-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates as shoppers spent more on projects
and  Hurricane Sandy  repairs. The company raised its quarterly
dividend 34 percent to 39 cents a share. It plans to repurchase
$17 billion of stock by the end of its fiscal 2015.  Delphi Rises  Delphi Automotive Plc (DLPH)  rose 10 percent to $42.20. The former
parts unit of General Motors Co. initiated a  dividend , its first
since returning to the public markets after bankruptcy.  J.C. Penney tumbled 21 percent to $17.69. The department-
store chain lost $4.3 billion in sales in the first year of
Chief Executive Officer  Ron Johnson ’s turnaround plan, with
annual  revenue  sliding 25 percent to $13 billion, the lowest
since at least 1987. The company’s net loss for the quarter
widened to $552 million from $87 million a year earlier.  Sears slipped 6 percent to $44.36. The retailer controlled
by hedge-fund manager  Edward Lampert  posted a fourth-quarter
loss that was larger than it forecast as sales fell for the
sixth consecutive year.  ‘Very Active’  Apple declined 4.5 percent to $430.47, the lowest level
since January 2012. While Cook said he’s in “very, very
active” talks about what to do with $137.1 billion in cash and
investments that Apple has, he ended the company’s annual
shareholder meeting without giving any additional insight.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  plunged 25 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $25.35. The world’s biggest maker of thin-film solar
panels said first-quarter revenue will fall short of analysts’
expectations after it shuttering a plant in  Germany . The company
said its “expected revenue” fell 15 percent last year and its
goal for this year is to avoid slipping further.  Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC)  fell 9.1 percent to $13.76. The
fifth-largest U.S. cable provider by subscribers reported a
quarterly operating  loss , blaming costs related to Superstorm
Sandy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
