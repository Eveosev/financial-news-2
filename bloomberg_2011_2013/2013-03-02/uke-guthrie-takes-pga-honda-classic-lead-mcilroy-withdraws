Luke Guthrie fired a 7-under 63 to
take the lead in the PGA’s Honda Classic, while the world’s No.
1 and defending champion Rory McIlroy left the tournament with a
sore wisdom tooth.  Guthrie, 23, is 9-under 131 through 36 holes for a one-
stroke lead over  Michael Thompson  going into today’s third round
at PGA National Resort & Spa at  Palm Beach Gardens , Florida.  “Obviously we played the ball down today, so you might get
a little mud here and there,” Guthrie said. “But it’s the same
story it’s going to be all week, put the ball in the fairway or
else you’re not going to have much of a chance around here.”  Tiger Woods shot a second day of even par 70 to make the
cut for the final two rounds.  “Well, I didn’t hit it anywhere near as good as I did
(Thursday),” Woods said yesterday. “I didn’t have it today.”  The 23-year-old McIlroy walked off the course after hitting
a shot on No. 18, his ninth hole of the day. He was 7-over par,
with a triple bogey on the par-4 16th hole, and trailed co-
leaders  Geoff Ogilvy  and Doug LaBelle II by 14 shots after
starting the day at even par.  “I sincerely apologize to The Honda Classic and PGA Tour
for my sudden withdrawal,” McIlroy said in a statement released
by the tour. “I was simply unable to concentrate.”  Boo Weekley and Graham DeLaet are tied for third at 7-under,
while  Lee Westwood ,  Justin Rose , Charles Howell III, Geoff
Ogilvy,  Sean O’Hair  and Doug LaBelle II are all a stroke back.  To contact the reporter on this story:
