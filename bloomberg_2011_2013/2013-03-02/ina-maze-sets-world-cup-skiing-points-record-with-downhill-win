Slovenia’s Tina Maze set a World Cup
skiing record for points in a season by winning today’s women’s
downhill in  Germany .  The victory in Garmisch-Partenkirchen gives Maze 2,024
points, breaking the mark of 2,000 points by Austrian Hermann Maier in 2000. The 29-year-old, who has already clinched the
overall World Cup championship, also topped the women’s season
record of 1,980 points set by American Lindsey Vonn last year.  Maze now trails Vonn, who is sidelined with a knee injury,
by one point in the downhill standings heading into the final
race of the season March 13 in Lenzerheide, Switzerland. It was
her ninth win of the World Cup campaign and her first in the
downhill.  Maze’s time of 1 minute, 40.46 seconds was 0.39 seconds
better than American Laurenne Ross. Germany’s Maria Hoefl-Riesch
was 0.11 seconds further back in third.  France ’s Adrien Theaux won today’s men’s downhill in
Kvitfjell,  Norway , for his first victory of the season and
second of his career.  Theaux, 28, finished in a time of 1:29.10, 0.19 seconds
faster than world champion Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway and 0.50
seconds ahead of Austrian Klaus Kroell. Theaux’s previous World
Cup victory came in a downhill in Lenzerheide in 2011.  Svindal increased his lead in the downhill standings to 58
points over Kroell. He also moved within 129 points of Austrian
Marcel Hirscher, who didn’t race today, for the overall title.  The women will run a Super-G race tomorrow in Garmisch,
while the men race the same event in Kvitfjell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
