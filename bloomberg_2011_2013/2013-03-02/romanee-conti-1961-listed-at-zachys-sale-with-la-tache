A single bottle of Romanee Conti
1961 Domaine de la Romanee Conti is on sale along with a half-
case of La Tache DRC 2002 as Burgundy wines take center stage at
Zachys  New York  auction this week.  The Romanee-Conti carries a higher estimate of $7,000 for
the single lot, while the six bottles of neighboring La Tache
are priced to fetch as much as $12,000 together, according to
online catalog. Other Burgundy producers represented include
Bonnes Mares Georges Roumier 1988 and Domaine Ponsot 2005.  The sale comes amid a recovery in fine-wine prices over the
past three months, after the London-based Liv-ex Fine Wine 50
Index touched its lowest level for 32 months in November. It has
rallied 9 percent since then, including 2.9 percent last month,
and in January had its biggest monthly gain for two years as
collectors sought wines beaten down during the financial crisis.  Hart Davis Hart Wine Co. is also planning an auction this
month devoted exclusively to Burgundy, including 175 lots of
Domaine de la Romanee-Conti spanning 33 vintages from 1966
onwards.  The Hart sale, in  Chicago , also includes 52 lots of Henri Jayer, including a bottle of 1985 Richebourg carrying a top
estimate of $14,000 and two bottles of 1985 Vosne-Romanee Cros
Parantoux estimated at as much as $12,000. At a Hart auction in
February, 12 bottles of Jayerâ€™s 1990 Cros Parantoux sold for
$113,525.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
this year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to
