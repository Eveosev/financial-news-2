Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the militant who
claimed responsibility for January’s attack on an Algerian
natural-gas complex, was killed by Chadian soldiers in  Mali ,
al-Jazeera reported, citing a statement from the Chadian army.  Belmokhtar died during a raid today on an Islamist
base, General Zacharia Gobongue, a Chadian armed forces
spokesman, said in a statement, according to Jazeera.  Belmokhtar headed the al-Qaeda-linked militant group al
Mulathameen that led the attack on the In Amenas facility that
left as many as 85 people dead. He previously led al-Qaeda in
the Islamic Maghreb, known as AQIM.     AQIM is among groups being targeted by French armed
forces in Mali, and is suspected by the U.S. of playing a role
in the attack on the Algerian facility. Belmokhtar’s death comes
a day after  Chad ’s military said it had killed Abou Zeid,
another Al-Qaeda-linked commander in the region.  The French military, which is leading the offensive against
militant Islamists in northern Mali, has said it cannot yet
confirm either claim, Jazeera said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
