Six bottles of white Montrachet 1993
Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Grand Cru Burgundy fetched top price
at a  Sotheby’s (BID)  wine sale in London this week, selling for 21,150
pounds ($32,060) and matching the auction house’s high estimate.  A similar half-case sold for 18,800 pounds, according to
Sotheby’s e-mailed results. Both carried presale estimates of
15,000 pounds to 18,000 pounds and went to an Asian buyer.  The sale came as Burgundy wines also led auctions held by
Acker Merrall & Condit in New York and Christie’s International
Plc online. While the broader wine market has rebounded since
December, demand has focused more on rarer Burgundies as Asian
collectors sought to diversify away from heavily-traded Bordeaux
labels. The London-based Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index rose 2.9
percent in February, its third straight monthly gain.  Other leading lots at the Sotheby’s sale included three
cases of Chateau Haut Brion 1989 vintage, the Bordeaux
vineyard’s most expensive of the past half-century. One case
sold for 10,810 pounds, within the presale estimate, and the
other two for 9,988 pounds each.  Acker Merrall & Condit sold a three-bottle lot of Romanee
Conti 2006 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti for $27,060 at a  New York 
sale on Feb. 23, along with 12 bottles of Leroy Romanee-Saint-
Vivant 1962 for $24,600 and Rousseau Chambertin Clos de Beze
1990 for $18,450.  Christie’s sold a case of Montrachet 1988 DRC for $33,880
at an online auction, with two bottles of the 1985 vintage
fetching $7,260.  Following is a table of major auctions held so far this
year.  To contact the reporter on the story:
