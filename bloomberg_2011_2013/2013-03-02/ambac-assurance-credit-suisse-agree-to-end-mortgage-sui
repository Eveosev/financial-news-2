Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABKFQ)  ended a
lawsuit against  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  over claims it was misled
in purchases of mortgage-backed securities, according to a court
filing.  The two sides said in papers filed today in New York state
court in  Manhattan  that they have agreed to discontinue the
litigation. They offered no explanation for the decision.  Ambac’s bond insurance unit, Ambac Assurance Corp., sued
two units of Zurich-based Credit Suisse in January 2010,
alleging breach of warranties, breach of repurchase and other
damages in addition to fraudulent inducement.  Ambac, based in New York, said in the suit that Credit
Suisse misstated the attributes of securitized loans and the
underwriting guidelines used to select them, and violated
agreements by refusing to repurchase the securities.  John Ansbro, an attorney representing Credit Suisse,
declined to comment on the filing. Peter Tomlinson, a lawyer for
Ambac, didn’t immediately respond to a voice-mail message
seeking comment on the filing.  The case is Ambac Assurance Corp. v. DLJ Mortgage Capital,
Inc. 600070/2010,  New York  State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
