Princeton University  won 58-53
against Ivy League Conference leader  Harvard University , who had
its four-game winning streak broken in men’s college basketball.  Harvard (17-8, 9-2 Ivy) is one-half game ahead of Princeton
(15-9, 8-2 Ivy) in the eight-team conference.  Harvard has three regular-season games left and Princeton
has four. They’ll have a one-game playoff for a berth in the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament -- the Ivy
League’s second playoff in three seasons -- if they both finish
with the same conference record.  Ian Hummer had 23 points and 14 rebounds for the Tigers and
T.J. Bray added 14 last night at L. Stockwell Jadwin Gymnasium
in Princeton, New Jersey.  Steve Moundou-Missi came off the bench to score 15 points
for the Crimson, who trailed 30-24 at the half. Wesley Saunders
contributed 11.  In other  Ivy League  games, it was Columbia 59, Yale 46;
Brown 84, Cornell 65; and Dartmouth 69, Pennsylvania 64.  To contact the reporter on this story:
