Billionaire  Steve Wynn  and other
directors of Wynn Resorts Ltd. face renewal of a shareholder
lawsuit alleging a $135 million donation to the University of
Macau breached fiduciary duties and wasted company assets.  The accusations by a Louisiana police retirement fund
resembled those of former Wynn Resorts director Kazuo Okada, who
sued the casino operator over the gift in January 2012. They
were dismissed in February by U.S. District Judge James Mahan in
Las Vegas, who said the investors didn’t convincingly show that
Wynn and his directors had done anything wrong. He said they
could try again.  The fund yesterday asked in a court filing for more time to
file an amended complaint, saying  Wynn Resorts (WYNN)  had agreed to the
proposed extension. A new suit will be filed by March 18 seeking
the judge’s consent to pursue it, according to the filing.  In May 2011, Steve Wynn and almost all of Wynn Resorts’
board approved the gift to the University of Macau’s Development
Foundation. Last May, Macau’s government approved the Las Vegas-
based company’s plan to build a $4 billion resort on a 51-acre
site on the Cotai Strip.  Okada resigned from the board of Wynn Resorts in February
ahead of a shareholder vote on whether to remove him.  The case is Louisiana Municipal Employees’ Retirement
System v. Wynn, 2:12-cv-00509, U.S. District Court, District of
 Nevada  ( Las Vegas ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
