Ireland’s central bank said it is
considering enforcement actions against lenders as it continues
an investigation into the sale of payment-protection insurance
policies.  Bank of Ireland Plc,  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK)  and its ESB
unit,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ’s  Ulster Bank , Permanent
TSB Group Holdings Plc and GE Money have been told to review
their PPI sales since August 2007, the Dublin-based
bank said in a statement.  The lenders will be communicating with customers over the
coming weeks “to outline the approach they will be taking and
the expected timelines for completion of their reviews,” it
said. Other unnamed lenders are also being investigated, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
