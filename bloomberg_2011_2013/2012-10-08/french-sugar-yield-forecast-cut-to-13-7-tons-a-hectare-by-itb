French sugar yields from beets are
expected to average about 13.7 metric tons a hectare (2.47
acres), industry researcher Institut Technique de la Betterave
said, lowering its outlook from 13.8 tons in September.  The outlook for beets in the Somme, Champagne and Nord
regions was cut due to a lack of moisture, with predicted yields
there lowered by 0.3 ton of sugar per hectare from last month’s
forecast, the Paris-based institute wrote in an  online report 
dated Oct. 5.  Beet harvesting in  France , the European Union’s largest
sugar producer, started in the middle of September in difficult
conditions due to dry soil, before rain at the end of the month
improved fields, the ITB reported.  “The precipitation in the final 10 days improved the
conditions for uprooting and allowed for a better harvest
quality,” the researcher wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
