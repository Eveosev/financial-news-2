Polish day-ahead stayed near a 12-
week low as increased wind output outweighed capacity cuts due
to plant outages.  Power for tomorrow  increased 1 percent to 170.17 zloty
($54.18) a megawatt-hour, according to exchange data compiled by
Bloomberg. Day-ahead electricity traded at 168.45 zloty a
megawatt-hour yesterday, the lowest level for week-day delivery
since July 19.  Wind speeds in Gdansk, northern  Poland , the region where
most turbines are located, are predicted to be as high as 39
kilometers (24 miles) per hour tomorrow, triple the average of
the last 5 years, CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg show.  Wind farms generated 1,750 megawatt-hours on Oct. 6 or as
much as 11 percent of the country’s power consumption, data from
the power grid manager PSE Operator showed. Polish utilities  PGE
SA (PGE)  and  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)  were set to keep 835 megawatts
of capacity off line due to unplanned outages, according to the
companies’ websites.  Next-day contracts on the Czech market settled 5.7 percent
lower at 46.34 euros ($60.13) a megawatt-hour in a daily
auction, while the Slovak contract closed 0.6 percent higher at
49.46 euros a megawatt-hour, according to the countries’ market
operators. Electricity for the next day in  Hungary  added 2.1
percent to 50.19 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
