Saudi Arabia  and  Kuwait  have delayed
a tender to develop the jointly-held offshore Dorra natural gas
field until early 2013, MEED projects news service said on its
website, without saying where it got the information.  The Dorra field will be developed by Khafji Joint
Operations Co., a venture between Kuwait Gulf Oil Co. and Aramco
Gulf Operations Co. The field is estimated to hold 60 trillion
cubic feet of gas, according to MEED.  Management of KJO, as the venture is known, rotates every
three years between its partners, and MEED said it expects field
development to accelerate next year when Saudi Arabia takes over
management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
