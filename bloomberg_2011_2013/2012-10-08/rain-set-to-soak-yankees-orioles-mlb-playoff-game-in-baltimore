Rain will begin falling in Baltimore
hours before the  New York Yankees  take the field against the
Orioles and keep on falling right through the night.  About 0.25 an inch (6.4 millimeters) of rain is predicted
to fall before showers end sometime overnight, said Heather
Sheffield, a  National Weather Service  meteorologist in Sterling,
Virginia.  “You can expect a wet evening,” Sheffield said by
telephone. “This evening is the best chance for rain, starting
in the next couple of hours and going through tonight.”  The Yankees beat the Orioles 7-2 in the opener of the best-
of-five Major League Baseball playoff series between the
American League East division rivals last night. Showers delayed
the game’s start by 2 hours, 41 minutes.  The teams competed for the division title until the final
day of the regular season, with the Yankees finishing two games
ahead.  Sheffield said the rain will end in Baltimore by tomorrow,
which is scheduled to be an off day before the series resumes in
New York on Oct. 10.  The sky will be mostly clear in  St. Louis  when the
 Washington Nationals  meet the Cardinals in their National League
playoff game tonight, according to the National Weather Service
in St. Charles, Missouri. The low is expected to reach 42
degrees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
