Relative yields on corporate debt,
already near the lowest in more than a year, still have room to
tighten, according to Jack Malvey, chief global markets
strategist at Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  “There is more room to go,” Malvey said during an
interview on Bloomberg TV’s “Lunch Money” with  Stephanie Ruhle 
and  Adam Johnson . “Investors are voting for the incremental
yield and also for the portfolio diversification” that
corporate bonds offer. The extra interest offered by “high-
quality, high-yield” bonds makes them preferable on a total
portfolio basis to investment-grade debt, he said.  The average yield of  junk bonds  was 7.07 percent on Oct. 5,
up from a record low 6.95 percent on Sept. 19 and compared with
an average 2.87 percent yield for investment-grade debt,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.
Speculative-grade bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at  Standard & Poor’s .  “Over the near term, there’s no chance central banks will
reverse their operations,” said Malvey, who formerly headed
global fixed-income strategy at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
according to the Bank of  New York  Mellon  website . “It’s pedal
to the metal for monetary policy.”  The extra yield investors demand to hold company bonds from
the most creditworthy to the riskiest borrowers rather than U.S.
Treasuries stood at 240 basis points on Oct. 5, tying the lowest
since 238 basis points on June 1, 2011, the index data show. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
