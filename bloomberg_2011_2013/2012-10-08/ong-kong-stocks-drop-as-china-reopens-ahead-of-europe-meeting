Hong Kong   stocks  fell, with the
city’s benchmark equities declining for the first time in six
days, as  China ’s markets reopened after a week-long break.  ZTE Corp. (000063) , a Chinese phone-equipment maker, slumped 6
percent after a draft U.S. congressional report said the company
poses a security threat.  SIM Technology Group Ltd. (2000) , a mobile-
handset designer, tumbled 23 percent after saying it plans to
raise as much as HK$175.7 million ($22.7 million).  Yue Yuen
Industrial Holdings Ltd. (551) , which makes shoes for Nike Inc.,
climbed as much as 3 percent after the U.S. unemployment rate
dropped. China Southern Airlines Co. paced gains among airlines
after the number of passengers rose in China during the
holidays.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  declined 0.9 percent to 20,824.56 at
the close, with almost four stocks falling for each that gained.
The city’s benchmark stock index rose 2.4 percent in the five
days through Oct. 5. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
mainland companies, also known as the H-share index, slid 1.3
percent to 9,839.84.  “It looks like the U.S. is going through a recovery and
things are quite strong there, China is the wobbly leg and
 Europe ’s another wobbly leg and so it’s two out of three that
are providing a little bit of uncertainty,” said Marco Li, Hong
Kong-based portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management, which
oversees $218 billion globally. “For the rally to continue you
need a little bit more firming of the two wobbly legs.”  Volume on Hang Seng Index was 11 percent below the 30-day
average for the time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Central Banks  The Hong Kong equity benchmark index rose 14 percent this
year through Oct. 5 as central banks from the U.S., Europe and
China announced measures to boost their economies. The Hang Seng
Index  traded  at 11.1 times estimated earnings on average on Oct.
5, compared with 13.9 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 12.2 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  European finance ministers will meet in Luxembourg today,
while German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  visits Greece tomorrow for
the first time since the crisis erupted. Spanish Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  travels on Oct. 10 for talks with French President
 Francois Hollande  in Paris. German data today may show
industrial production and exports fell.  ZTE slumped 6 percent to HK$12.60. The company and Huawei
Technologies Co., China’s two largest phone-equipment makers,
provide opportunities for Chinese intelligence services to
tamper with U.S. telecommunications networks for spying,
according to a congressional report to be released today.  ‘State Influence’  “Based on available classified and unclassified
information, Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of
foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the
 United States  and to our systems,” says the House intelligence
committee report.  Executives for Huawei and ZTE, both based in Shenzhen,
China, denied links to Chinese espionage at an intelligence
committee hearing last month, telling lawmakers they aren’t
controlled by the Chinese government.  SIM Technology tumbled 23 percent to 34.5 Hong Kong cents.
The company plans to raise capital through rights offering of
one new share for every two existing shares, the company said in
a statement to the city’s bourse on Oct. 5.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) , the biggest Hong
Kong-listed mainland developer by value, slid 3 percent to
HK$19.20 while state-owned China Resources Land Ltd. fell 3.4
percent to HK$16.56. Macquarie Securities Ltd. cut its rating on
China’s property sector to equalweight from overweight, citing
strong gains in the past year and delayed policy relaxation
expectations.  U.S. Futures  China’s new home prices in September climbed 0.17 percent
from August to 8,753  yuan  ($1,393) per square meter (10.76
square feet), SouFun Holdings Ltd., the country’s biggest real-
estate website owner said in an e-mailed statement today, based
on its survey of 100 cities. The central government has pledged
it won’t waver from policies aimed at suppressing property-price
gains.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent
today. The gauge closed little changed Oct. 5 as Apple Inc., the
world’s largest company by market value, slumped. U.S.
unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 7.8 percent in September,
a Labor Department report showed, the lowest since President
 Barack Obama  took office in January 2009, as employers took on
more part-time workers.  Airlines Climb  Yue Yuen gained 0.6 percent to HK$26.60, while  Li & Fung
Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes that counts the U.S. as its
top market, climbed as much as 1.8 percent before closing 0.3
percent higher at HK$12.08.  Among other stocks that rose, China Southern Airlines,
 Asia ’s biggest carrier by passenger numbers, rose 3.9 percent to
HK$3.69 and China Eastern Airlines Corp. advanced 1.6 percent to
HK$2.54.  The number of passengers rose 27 percent during the Sept.
30 to Oct. 7 holiday from the comparable period a year earlier,
according to a statement on Civil Aviation Administration’s
