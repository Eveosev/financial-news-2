China  needs to expand the access
local governments have to private capital for funding about 19
trillion  yuan  ($3 trillion) of investment projects they’ve
announced since May, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts wrote.  Slowing economic growth and central government limits on
lending to local authorities and the property sector have
created “headwinds” for local governments’ “traditional”
funding sources that include fiscal revenue, land sales and bank
borrowings, Hong Kong-based analysts Haibin Zhu, Lu Jiang and
Grace Ng wrote in a research note dated Oct. 5.  A lack of funding for local government investment projects
may extend the economic slowdown in China, where growth
moderated in the second quarter to the weakest pace in three
years, Song Guoqing, an adviser to the nation’s central bank,
said last month. Expansion has slowed as the  European debt
crisis  sap demand for exports and a campaign to rein in  home
prices  eroded domestic consumption.  In 2008, China introduced a 4 trillion yuan stimulus plan
to fend against the effects of the global financial crisis. That
plan provided  loans  from state-owned banks for local
infrastructure projects, which later spurred concerns some of
the debt would go unpaid.  “The crucial ingredient is the source of funding,” the
JPMorgan analysts wrote. “The lesson from the 2008-2009
experience is that the government should reduce the role of
public funding and allow access of private capital in areas that
used to be dominated by the state sector.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Aipeng Soo in
