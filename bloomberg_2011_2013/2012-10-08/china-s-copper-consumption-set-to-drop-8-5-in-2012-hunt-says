Copper consumption in  China  will
contract this year for the first time since 2008 as demand
falters and inventories climb in the largest user, before
rebounding in 2013, according to Simon Hunt Strategic Services.  Consumption will drop about 8.5 percent to 5.6 million
metric tons in 2012, said Simon Hunt, chief executive officer of
the Weybridge, Surrey-based consultancy, which compiles analysis
for users and fabricators. Next year, usage may grow 5.6 percent
to 5.9 million tons, Hunt said in an interview in Singapore
after visiting China for two weeks last month.  Hunt’s assessment adds to signs that China’s slowdown is
hurting demand for commodities. Copper, used in wires and cables,
helps set the pace for other base metals and the drop in China’s
consumption may hurt prices and cut profits at mining companies
including  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  Copper rose 6.8
percent last quarter as central banks in the U.S., China,  Japan 
and  Europe  expanded stimulus to try to revive economic growth.  “The safety valve of exports has gone, the domestic
economy is slowing down, they have a problem of surplus capacity
and cash is extraordinarily tight,” said Hunt, who estimated
total copper reserves in China at 3.5 million tons, including
reported and unreported stockpiles. “There are no signals of a
recovery in heavy industry and manufacturing.”  ‘Trip Over’  Three-month copper futures on the London Metal Exchange,
which tumbled 21 percent last year as Europe’s debt crisis hurt
global growth, traded at $8,198.25 a ton today. The price
touched $8,422 on Sept. 19, a week after the U.S. Federal
Reserve announced a third round of so-called quantitative easing.
The U.S. is the world’s second-largest copper user.  China’s slowdown this year “has been significant,” the
 World Bank  said in a report yesterday, citing declining external
demand and a property-market correction. Copper  stockpiles 
monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange totaled 162,547 tons
in the week to Sept. 27, about 66 percent above a year earlier.  “There’s a huge amount of inventories of all types,” said
Hunt, whose visit to China included one of the top five power-
cable makers. “You walk round and trip over drums of cables.”  China imported 2.39 million tons of  refined metal  in the
first eight months, up from 1.51 million tons the previous year,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on customs data.
Global demand exceeded output by 129,000 tons in the first half
of 2012, the World Bureau of Metal Statistics said on Aug. 16.  Bonded Warehouses  “When you get a pickup, it’s not going to have an
immediate impact on output of semi-fabricated products because
you’ll be depleting inventories,” said Hunt. There are about
650,000 tons of copper in bonded warehouses, he said. That
matches forecasts by Barclays Plc and Standard Chartered Plc.  Refined consumption in China may expand about 2 percent to
4 percent a year from next year, compared with average growth of
about 10 percent a year the past 10 years, he said. Consumption
shrank 0.9 percent in 2008 amid the global recession.  Growth in  China’s economy  slowed to a three-year-low of 7.6
percent in the second quarter. The government is trying to
prevent expansion this year from slipping below a 7.5 percent
target set in March, which would be the weakest since 1990.  Hunt started in the metals and mining industry in 1956 and

Mackenzie Ltd., in 1975.  To contact the reporter on this story:
