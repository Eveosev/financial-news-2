Motorcycle thefts in the U.S. fell at
a slower pace last year as declines in Texas and  Florida  were
partially offset by an increase in  California , the  National
Insurance Crime Bureau  said.  There were 46,667 thefts in the U.S. last year, a decrease
of 6 percent from 2010, even as motorcycle sales rose, according
to a report released today by the Des Plaines, Illinois-based
group. Thefts dropped 13 percent in 2009 and 11 percent in 2010.  California, the most populous U.S. state and the one with
the most stolen motorcycles since the NICB began collecting data
in 1996, retained its top spot with 5,927 thefts last year. It
was followed by Texas and Florida. After at least four straight
years of declining thefts, California motorcyclists saw 265 more
thefts than in 2010.  “With the economy turning around and people actually
taking more trips, using their bikes for commuting, there’s more
exposure,” Imre Szauter, the owner of a 1998 BMW R1100RT and
government-affairs manager for the Ohio-based American
Motorcyclist Association, said in a phone interview before the
report’s release. “Typically with more exposure, you would
expect some increase in thefts.”  People in warm-weather areas ride their motorcycles more
often, increasing the number of targets for thieves, Frank G. Scafidi, a spokesman for the NICB, said in a phone interview
last week. Most parts of California received about half the
normal annual rainfall last year, said Scott Sukup, a
meteorologist based in Oxnard, California,.  Thefts in  Texas  last year declined 10 percent to 3,950 from
a year earlier. In Florida, thefts fell 5.3 percent to 3,927.  July and August were the biggest months for thefts in the
U.S. last year, with more than 5,000 each, compared with 2,147
in February, the report shows. U.S. thefts declined because of
advances in technology, Scafidi said.  “Newer vehicles in cars and in motorcycles tend to have
more secure features than ever before,” he said.  New York had 1,460 thefts in 2011, and  New Jersey  had 907.
More than 500 motorcycle makes were among those stolen last
year. Honda had the top spot with more than 11,000 motorcycles
stolen, followed by Yamaha and Suzuki, the NICB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
