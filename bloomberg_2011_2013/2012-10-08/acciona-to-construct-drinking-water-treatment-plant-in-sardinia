Acciona SA (ANA) , a renewable energy and
water provider, said it will design and construct its third
drinking water treatment plant on the Italian island of
Sardinia.  The Alcobendas, Spain-based company said the 9.2 million-
euro ($12 million) venture with Abbanoa SpA will serve the water
needs of as many as 170,000 people in the central and
northeastern parts of the Mediterranean island, including the
resorts of Budoni, Posada, Siniscola, Torpe and San Teodoro.  It’s the third drinking water plant for Acciona Agua
following the construction of the Pedra Majore and Menta
facilities. Acciona Agua has a 40-project portfolio in  Italy 
serving at least 2.5 million people, the company said today in a
statement.  Last month, Acciona won wastewater treatment contracts in
Mexico City and Costa Rica and also plans to build a
desalination plant for the mining industry in  Chile ’s Atacama
desert.  To contact the reporter on this story:
