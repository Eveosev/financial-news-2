Funding for Canadian iron-ore
projects may be in doubt after prices for the steelmaking raw
material plunged, according to  Labrador Iron Mines Holding Ltd. (LIM)   The slump called into question the viability of developing
or expanding Canadian mines that would lift production by about
200 million metric tons between 2018 and 2020, based on
government forecasts, Chief Executive Officer John Kearney said
today at the  7th EU Iron Ore Conference  in Vienna.  “The finance ability of some of those projects has got to
be questioned,” he said. “We got beaten up really badly.”  Ore  prices  as gauged by The Steel Index Ltd. reached $86.70
a dry metric ton, the lowest level in almost three years, on
Sept. 5 as slowing demand caused  steel mills  in  China  to curb
purchases. Prices are still down 20 percent in 2012 even after
rebounding from last month’s low. Shares of Toronto-based
Labrador slumped 80 percent this year.  Labrador lost money on two of three ore shipments sold in
August, scaled back production to 1.7 million tons from 2
million tons and postponed $100 million of spending to develop a
second mine next year, Kearney said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
