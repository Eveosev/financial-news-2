Expanding  palm-oil  production is
driving rain-forest destruction in the Indonesian part of the
island of  Borneo , also known as Kalimantan, according to a study
by researchers at Stanford and Yale universities.  The area converted to palm oil increased 35-fold between
1990 and 2010, with 90 percent of the land covered with forest
prior to conversion, according to the  study  published in the
journal Nature Climate Change.  Indonesia’s palm oil and palm-kernel oil production
generated about $11.1 billion in 2010, the researchers wrote. At
the same time, the country was one of the largest emitters of
 greenhouse gases , mostly because of land-based  carbon emissions 
including deforestation, they said.  “Despite contentious debate over the types and uses of
lands slated for oil palm plantations, the sector has grown
rapidly over the past 20 years,” Lisa Curran, a professor of
anthropology at Stanford who contributed to the study, was cited
as saying in an online press release.  Of the area converted into palm oil plantations between
1990 and 2010, 47 percent was tropical forest, 22 percent
logged forest and 21 percent agroforests, according to the
study.  Palm-oil plantations, which covered 903 square kilometers
(349 square miles) of the island in 1990, expanded by 746 square
kilometers a year to cover 8,360 square kilometers in 2000,
according to the researchers, who used satellite data to map and
classify lands cleared for oil palm, and estimate greenhouse-gas
emissions.  Clearing rates more than tripled to 2,328 square kilometers
a year between 2000 and 2010, with oil-palm plantations covering
31,640 square kilometers at the end of the period, the study
showed.  Potential Development  After the 20-year expansion, 79 percent of plantation
leases remained unplanted in 2010, the study showed. Full lease
development would convert 93,844 square kilometers to oil palm,
including 41 percent intact forest, and oil palm would then
cover 34 percent of Kalimantan’s lowlands outside protected
areas, the researchers wrote.  Sustainably producing palm oil will require re-evaluating
awarded oil-palm plantation leases located on forested land,
according to the researchers.  “Plantation expansion in Kalimantan alone is projected to
contribute 18 percent to 22 percent of  Indonesia ’s 2020 C02-
equivalent emissions,” the researchers wrote.  Plantation expansion is projected to release more than 558
million metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere in 2020,
more than all of  Canada ’s fossil fuel emissions, according to
Stanford.  “These plantation leases are an unprecedented grand-scale
experiment replacing forests with exotic palm mono cultures,”
Curran was cited as saying. “We may see tipping points in
forest conversion where critical biophysical functions are
disrupted, leaving the region increasingly vulnerable to
droughts, fires and floods.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
