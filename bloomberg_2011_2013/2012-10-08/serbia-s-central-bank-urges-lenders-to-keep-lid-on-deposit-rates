Serbia ’s central bank urged
commercial banks to offer “reasonable” rates on savings
instead of adding premiums to lure new depositors.  An “unmeasured increase in interest rates should not turn
into unreasonable competition,” the Belgrade-based Narodna
Banka Srbije said in an e-mail today. High rates on savings
deposits may expose banks to “liquidity shocks” by spreading
risk throughout the financial system, the central bank said.  Serbia has raised borrowing costs three times this year to
slow dinar declines and curb inflation. Other monetary
authorities in eastern  Europe  are following the lead of central
banks in the U.S. and Britain by cutting rates to halt the
economic slowdown.  Banks pay between 3 percent and 5.5 percent on euro-
denominated one-year deposits and between 3.1 percent and 6
percent on three-year savings. Savings’ volumes tend to increase
in November, with banks offering higher  interest rates  on
deposits on the occasion of the International Savings Day,
according to the central bank’s data.  Household savings in Serbia totaled 931.27 billion dinars
($10.53 billion) in August. Since 2007, savings were expanding
by between 1.5 percent and 15 percent in real terms in November.  Seventy-four percent of banks in Serbia are  majority owned 
by financial institutions, mainly from Italy,  Austria , and
Greece, most of which are increasingly relying on locally
sourced savings to fund lending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
