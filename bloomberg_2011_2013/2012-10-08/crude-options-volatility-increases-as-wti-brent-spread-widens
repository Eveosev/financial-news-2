Oil options volatility rose as
underlying futures declined and the spread between U.S. and
global crudes grew to the widest point in almost a year.  Implied volatility for options expiring in November, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 30.83 percent at 3:40 p.m.  New York  time, up
from 28.14 percent on Oct. 5.  Crude for November delivery dropped 55 cents to settle at
$89.33 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Brent oil
for November settlement slid 20 cents to $111.82 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The discount of Nymex West Texas Intermediate oil to Brent
widened to $22.49 a barrel, the most since Oct. 20, 2011, on
signs that supply in the U.S. is exceeding demand.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
January $120 calls with 2,439 lots changing hands. They rose 2
cents to 24 cents a barrel. November $84 puts were second-most
active options, with 1,185 contracts traded. They fell 3 cents
to 26 cents a barrel. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of oil.  Bullish bets accounted for 58 percent of the 23,991
contracts in electronic trading as of 4:38 p.m.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets accounted for 58
percent of the 104,594 contracts exchanged.  December $120 calls were the most-active options, with
4,356 lots trading hands while falling 2 cents to 11 cents a
barrel. November $95 calls were the second-most active, dropping
48 cents to 31 cents a barrel as 4,095 lots changed hands.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls, with
54,577 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 48,549
contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
