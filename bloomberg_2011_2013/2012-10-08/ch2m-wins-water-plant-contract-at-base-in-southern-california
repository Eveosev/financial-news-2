CH2M Hill Constructors Inc. was
awarded a $76.7 million contract to design and build a water
treatment system that includes pump stations and a potable water
reservoir at the Camp Pendleton base in  Southern California .  The contract that beat out eight other proposals has an
option that may raise its value to almost $81 million for
modifications to a project thatâ€™s scheduled for completion in
early 2016, according to the U.S. Defense Department statement.  Last month, the Defense Department awarded a $57.3 million
contract for a potable water system upgrade at Camp Pendleton to
a J.R. Filanc and Orion venture that includes higher capacity
potable water collection pipelines and three pump stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
