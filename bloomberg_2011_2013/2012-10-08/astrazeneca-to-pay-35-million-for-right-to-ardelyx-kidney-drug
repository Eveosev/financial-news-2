AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  agreed to pay $35
million for the right to develop an experimental drug from
 Ardelyx  to treat  kidney-disease  complications in Pascal Soriot’s
first licensing agreement as AstraZeneca chief executive.  Ardelyx also is eligible for payment of $237.5 million if
development goals are met, London-based AstraZeneca said in a
statement today. Additional amounts are payable for meeting
milestones tied to regulatory approvals and sales, according to
the statement. Ardelyx also would receive “double-digit”
royalties, AstraZeneca said.  The agreement fits with AstraZeneca’s strategy of licensing
drugs from other companies. The company, the U.K.’s second-
biggest drugmaker, after GlaxoSmithKline Plc, is seeking new
products to replace sales that it’s losing as top-selling
medicines face generic competitors. Chairman Leif Johansson said
in August he doesn’t expect that strategy to change under
Soriot, who joined AstraZeneca Oct. 1.  The agreement gives AstraZeneca the rights to RDX5791, a
drug that inhibits a protein involved in the absorption of
sodium in the intestine. By decreasing the absorption of dietary
sodium, sodium excretion is diverted from the kidney to the
feces, relieving the kidney and cardiovascular system of
“unhealthy exposure of both sodium and fluid accumulation,”
AstraZeneca said.  Ardelyx, a closely held company based in Fremont,
 California , and AstraZeneca plan to develop the drug for use in
end-stage renal disease, chronic kidney disease, irritable bowel
syndrome and other illnesses that result from sodium and fluid
overload. AstraZeneca will assume development costs and Ardelyx
will run mid-stage clinical trials, the companies said.  Ardelyx’s investors include  Amgen Inc.’s  venture-capital
fund, CMEA Capital and  New Enterprise Associates , according to
the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
