Vietnam ’s  government bonds  fell,
pushing the five-year yield to the highest level since May,
after the State Treasury sold more debt. The dong was steady.  The government on Oct. 5 auctioned 500 billion dong ($23.9
million) of three-year notes and 850 billion dong of two-year
bonds at 9.9 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively, according to
Hanoi Stock Exchange. The yields were 10 basis points higher
than at a sale of similar-maturity securities on Sept. 27.  “The supply of government bonds in the primary market is
expected to continue to be abundant,” analysts including Hoang
Nu Ngoc Thuy and Nguyen Thu Linh at Bank for Investment &
Development of Vietnam in  Hanoi  wrote in a research note today.
“The State Treasury may hold auctions to sell 2 trillion dong
to 3 trillion dong of bonds.”  The yield on the five-year notes rose eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point, to 10.23 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,890 per dollar as of 3:16 p.m. in
Hanoi, unchanged from the end of last week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set the
currency’s reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26,
according to its website. The dong is allowed to trade as much
as 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
