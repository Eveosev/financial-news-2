Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Meraux oil
refinery in  Louisiana  restarted its crude unit, which has been
shut since a July 22 fire.  It will take “several days” for the unit to run at full
rates, Bill Day, a San Antonio-based spokesman for the company,
said by phone.  The company shut the entire 135,000-barrel-a-day refinery,
10 miles (16 kilometers) east of New Orleans, after the fire. It
restarted downstream production units at the plant Aug. 6 and
ran them at reduced rates.  Hurricane Isaac, which hit Louisiana in late August,
delayed Valero’s plans to restart the crude unit in the first
week of September.  Valero restarted the downstream units Sept. 4 and has been
running them at reduced rates. The downstream units will advance
to full rates with the crude unit, Day said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
