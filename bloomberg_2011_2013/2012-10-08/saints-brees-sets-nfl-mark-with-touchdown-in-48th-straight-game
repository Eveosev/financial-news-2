New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees threw a touchdown pass in his 48th straight game, breaking
a National Football League record he shared with Hall of Famer
Johnny Unitas.  Brees threw a 40-yard scoring pass to Devery Henderson with
3:05 left in the first quarter of tonight’s game against the San
Diego Chargers at the Superdome in New Orleans.  The NFL earlier this week granted a request from Brees that
suspended Saints coach  Sean Payton , interim coach  Joe Vitt  and
General Manager Mickey Loomis be permitted to attend tonight’s
game away from the team. Payton, Vitt and Loomis, all of whom
were banned for their roles in the team’s bounty case, are in
attendance and Payton was shown on television applauding Brees’s
record-setting touchdown pass.  Unitas threw touchdown passes in 47 consecutive games from
Dec. 9, 1956, through Dec. 4, 1960, for the  Baltimore Colts .
Unitas, who died in 2002 at the age of 69, held sole possession
of the record for 19,663 days before Brees tied him last week
with three touchdown passes against the Green Bay Packers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
