The premium for California-blend
gasoline, or Carbob, fell by more than half after Governor  Jerry
Brown  directed state regulators to let refineries make winter-
blend fuel.  The California Air Resources Board granted refineries
permission yesterday to make an early shift to the winter blend,
typically not sold until after Oct. 31. The winter blend is
easier to make.  The premium for California-blend gasoline in Los Angeles
versus futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , lost 42.5
cents to 37.5 cents at 1:36 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The same fuel in San Francisco slumped
42.5 cents to 30.5 cents a gallon above futures.  Retail prices began to skyrocket after  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s
150,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Torrance, near Los Angeles,
reduced production Oct. 1 after a  power failure . That followed a
fire that knocked out a crude-processing unit at  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s
plant in Richmond, near  San Francisco , in August and the
shutdown of a Chevron pipeline that delivers crude to Northern
California because of contamination.  California-grade, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles fell 4.75
cents to 11 cents a gallon higher than heating oil futures on
the Nymex. The fuel in San Francisco dropped 5 cents to a
premium of 11.5 cents a gallon versus futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon, lost
7.5 cents to 27.5 cents a gallon against gasoline futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
