Gold futures fell for the second
straight session as the dollar’s advance curbed demand for the
metal as an alternative investment.  The greenback rose as much as 0.5 percent against a basket
of major currencies amid speculation that  Spain  is struggling to
avoid a bailout from mounting sovereign debt. On Oct. 5, gold
reached the highest in almost 11 months after the U.S.
unemployment rate fell to the lowest since January 2009, easing
pressure on the  Federal Reserve  to expand monetary stimulus.  “The dollar is keeping the market quiet,” Pratik Sharma,
a fund manager at Miami-based Atyant Capital, said in a
telephone interview. “There is also some profit-taking.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.3 percent to
settle at $1,775.70 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . On Oct. 5, the metal reached $1,798.10, the highest for a
most-active contract since Nov. 9.  In September, gold advanced 5.1 percent as stimulus
programs in the U.S., Europe and Japan and low  interest rates 
enhanced the appeal of the metal as an alternative to
currencies.  Silver futures for December delivery slumped 1.6 percent to
$34.017 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest drop since Sept. 24.  Platinum futures for January delivery fell 0.5 percent to
$1,698.80 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Palladium futures for December delivery declined 0.9 percent to
$656.95 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
