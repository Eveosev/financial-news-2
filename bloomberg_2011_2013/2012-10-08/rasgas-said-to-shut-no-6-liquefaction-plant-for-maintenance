Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas
Co., the Qatari LNG producer, shut its No. 6 liquefaction plant
last week for maintenance, according to two people with
knowledge of the work.  The halt will last about one month, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the information is
confidential. RasGas, as the venture between state-run Qatar
Petroleum and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  is known, said in an e-mail
today that the company doesn’t comment on shutdowns.  RasGas’s sixth plant, or train, is among the six largest in
the world, each capable of liquefying 7.8 million metric
tons of natural gas a year and located in the Persian Gulf
emirate. Gas from the sixth train is sold to companies including
 India ’s Petronet LNG Ltd., Korea Gas Investments Co., Chevron
Corp., Sempra Energy and Statoil ASA, according to  data from
the  International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas Importers .  The shutdown coincides with those of the fourth and fifth
trains at Qatar Liquefied Gas Co., another of the emirate’s LNG
producers. The three trains represent 30 percent of Qatar’s 77
million-ton-a-year liquefaction capacity.  Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG producer, started its 14th
train early last year and doesn’t plan to build any additional
plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
