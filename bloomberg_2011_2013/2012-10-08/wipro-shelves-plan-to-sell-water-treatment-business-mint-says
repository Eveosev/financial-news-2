Wipro Ltd. (WPRO)  has put aside plans to
sell its water treatment business after the company failed to
find any buyers, the Mint reported, citing two people involved
in the sale.  The water treatment business, a unit of Wipro
Infrastructure Engineering, was acquired from Aquatech
Industries Ltd. in 2008, the Mint said. Since then, the company
has explored the sale of the business at least twice, it said.  The market for water treatment in  India  is expanding at
least 18 percent annually and is now almost $420 million, the
Delhi-based publication said, citing EA Water Pvt., which tracks
the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
