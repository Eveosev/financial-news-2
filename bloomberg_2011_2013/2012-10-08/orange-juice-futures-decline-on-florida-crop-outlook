Orange juice headed for the biggest
drop in almost two weeks on signs of higher output in  Florida ,
the world’s second-biggest citrus grower. Cocoa also fell, while
coffee gained.  Florida’s orange production in the season that runs from
October to June may increase 4 percent from a year earlier to
152.4 million boxes, the highest since 2009, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of seven analysts. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture will release its first estimate of the crop on Oct.
11.  “The favorable production weather in Florida” is pushing
orange juice down, Fain Shaffer, the president of Infinity
Trading Corp in Medford,  Oregon , said in an e-mail. The price
may drop to $1 a pound in the short term, he said.  Orange juice for November delivery slumped 1.7 percent to
$1.132 at 10:42 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. A close at
that price would mark the biggest drop for a most-active
contract since Sept. 25. The last time the commodity fell below
$1 was May 23.  A box weighs 90 pounds (41 kilograms).  Brazil  is the
biggest producer.  The dollar climbed against a basket of major currencies,
eroding the appeal of commodities, Shaffer said.  Cocoa futures for December delivery slid 0.3 percent to
$2,374 a metric ton on ICE.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery rose 0.1
percent to $1.682 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
