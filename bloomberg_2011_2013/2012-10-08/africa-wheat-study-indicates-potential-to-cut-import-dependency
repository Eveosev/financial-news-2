African countries including Rwanda,
Burundi and  Uganda  have soils and conditions suitable to boost
wheat output and cut the continent’s import dependency, the
International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center said.  Eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa each have at least
500,000 hectares (1.24 million acres) of land available for
competitive and profitable wheat production without irrigation,
according to a study by the center, known by its acronym Cimmyt.  Wheat consumption in Africa is climbing as diets change
with growing urbanization, according to El Batan, Mexico-based
Cimmyt. African countries are forecast to spend about $12
billion this year to import 40 million metric tons of wheat.  “We would like to alert the world that there is potential
for wheat production in  Africa ,” Hans-Joachim Braun, director
of Cimmyt’s global wheat program, said by telephone. “We would
like to advise governments where to produce wheat.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
