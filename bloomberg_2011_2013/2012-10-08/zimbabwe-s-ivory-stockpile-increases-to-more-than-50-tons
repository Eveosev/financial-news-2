Zimbabwe ’s ivory stockpile increased
to more than 50 tons in September from 42 tons a year earlier,
wildlife authorities said.  The country has 100,000 elephants against a capacity of
45,000, mostly at Hwange National Park in the southwest,
Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Authority spokeswoman
Caroline Washaya-Moyo said. Water shortages led to the deaths of
17 elephants last month, she said.  Zimbabwe can’t cull the elephants or sell the ivory without
permission from the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species, Washaya-Moyo said. It doesn’t have such a
permit for selling the current ivory stocks, valued at about $13
million, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
