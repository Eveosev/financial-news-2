New World Resources Plc (NWR)  sees growth
in emerging markets including in  Asia  and Germany’s decision to
shut its nuclear power stations by 2022 maintaining demand for
coal, said Klaus-Dieter Beck, head of mining unit OKD.  “The demand for coal just keeps growing thanks to
countries like China,” Beck said today after speaking to
reporters in Prague. “Even in Europe it will grow because of
Germany’s decision to step away from nuclear energy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
