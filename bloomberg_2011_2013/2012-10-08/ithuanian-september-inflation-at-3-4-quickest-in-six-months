Lithuanian  inflation  accelerated in
September to the fastest in six months as household costs
surged.  Consumer prices rose 3.4 percent from last year, compared
with 3.3 percent in August, the  statistics office  in the
capital, Vilnius, said in an e-mailed statement today. Prices
increased 0.7 percent on the month.  Lithuania needs price growth to slow to remain on track for
euro adoption in 2014. In 2006, Lithuania became the only nation
rejected for the currency switch after it missed an inflation
target by 0.1 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
