BayWa AG (BYW) , a German distributor of
farm products and building materials, rose the most in a year as
investors bet on positive news from presentations scheduled for
a capital markets event starting tomorrow.  BayWa said last month it’s buying Rotterdam-based grain
trader Cefetra BV and a majority stake in German agricultural
trader Bohnhorst Agrarhandel GmbH to become an international
grain trader and lift annual sales to at least 15 billion euros
($19.5 billion). The company generated revenue of 9.6 billion
euros last year.  “BayWa hasn’t said much on future strategy or
profitability of the companies to be bought since announcing
those acquisitions,” said Bjoern Lippe, an analyst at Berenberg
Bank in  London , who recommends buying the shares. “Many
analysts have not incorporated the earnings potential from the
deals into their models, and investors may now be buying
positions ahead of what they expects will be good news from the
capital market day.”  The shares rose 5.6 percent, the most since Oct. 6, 2011,
to 33.43 euros in  Frankfurt , making them the biggest gainer
today on the  HDAX (HDAX)  index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
