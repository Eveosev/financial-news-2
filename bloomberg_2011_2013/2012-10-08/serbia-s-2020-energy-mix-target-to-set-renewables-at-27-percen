Serbia  will have to increase its use
of energy from renewable sources by a third through 2020, under
a European Union-backed regional agreement.  The accord among members of the Vienna-based  Energy
Community , due to be signed on Oct. 18 in Montenegro, will
require Serbia to improve the share from renewables to 27
percent from 21.2 percent now, said Deputy Energy Minister Dejan
Trifunovic after an energy conference in Belgrade today. The
improvement will be achieved mostly by adding new hydro plants
and through enhanced  energy efficiency , he said.  “There will be different targets for different countries,
but for us, it’ll be 27 percent,” he said and added that Serbia
lowered an original 32 percent target through negotiations.  The Balkan nation wants to become self-sufficient in
electricity production by 2015 by adding some 2,000 megawatts of
new capacity, including coal-fired plants, while attracting
investments in new hydro plants, wind and solar parks. It also
aspires to reduce reliance on oil and gas imports, which cost
about 1.15 billion euros ($1.5 billion) over the first eight
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
