Latvian consumer prices grew less
than analysts expected in September, which may have placed the
Baltic country’s  inflation rate  within the euro-adoption
criteria for the first time.  The inflation rate advanced to 1.8 percent from 1.7 percent
the previous month, the statistics office in Riga said today.
The result was below the 1.9 percent median estimate of six
economists in a Bloomberg survey. On the month, consumer prices
advanced 0.5 percent.  Euro applicants need to keep price growth within 1.5
percentage points of the 12-month average inflation rate of the
three EU nations with the lowest rate, according to targets set
out in the Maastricht Treaty. The euro-adoption target rate in
August was 3 percent.  Latvia  cut its  sales tax  by 1 percentage
point in July to slow inflation so it can join the euro in 2014.  “If the criteria stays at 3 percent in September, then
there’s a pretty good chance that Latvia fulfilled it for the
first time,” Lija Strasuna, an economist at  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) ’s
Latvian unit in Riga, said by telephone after the release.  The 12-month average inflation rate “will rise somewhat
until the end of the year, due to the base effect and most
likely food prices, but still it will be close to 2 percent,”
Strasuna said. The harmonized average rate “might be a little
above 2 percent in March 2013” when Latvia may apply to adopt
the euro, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
