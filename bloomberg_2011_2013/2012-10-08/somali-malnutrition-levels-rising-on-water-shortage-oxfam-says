The level of malnutrition in  Somalia 
is “alarming” after below-average seasonal rains that hurt the
so-called Gu harvest and led to rising food prices, Oxfam said.  Drought and famine in Somalia killed tens of thousands of
people last year and left another 4 million, or about half of
the population, dependent on food aid. It’s unlikely the Horn of
African nation is heading into another famine, even in the
worst-affected regions of Gedo, Lower Juba and Bakool, the U.K.-
based charity said today in an e-mailed report.  “Oxfam has found that water and food shortages are at
critical levels and likely to deteriorate in parts of the
country over the coming months, risking a prolonged humanitarian
crisis well into next year,” Oxfam said.  Oxfam based its findings on a survey of more than 1,800
households and 240 focus groups in 40 regions of Somalia between
July and August, according to the report.  Almost half of respondents said they regularly skipped
meals and a fifth had reduced their own serving sizes to ensure
their children had enough to eat. Some women reported walking 18
kilometers (11 miles) a day in search of water.  Oxfam warned that Somalia could slide back into “crisis”
without sustained support from aid agencies.  Somalia has been mired in civil conflict since the fall of
Mohamed Siad Barre’s dictatorship in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
