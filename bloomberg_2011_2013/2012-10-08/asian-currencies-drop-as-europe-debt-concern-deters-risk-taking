India ’s rupee and Malaysia’s ringgit
led losses in Asian currencies as demand for riskier assets
slowed before European leaders meet this week on measures to
prevent their region’s debt turmoil from deepening.  Asian stocks snapped a two-day gain as the World Bank said
economic growth in developing East Asia, which excludes India
and  Japan , will drop to an estimated 11-year low.  Europe ’s
finance ministers meet in Luxembourg today to discuss closer
banking cooperation and German Chancellor Angela Merkel visits
Greece tomorrow for the first time since the crisis began in
2009. On Oct. 10, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy travels
for talks with French President Francois Hollande in Paris.  “Investors are still concerned about Europe’s problem,”
said Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange trader at  Bangkok
Bank Pcl. (BBL)  “There has also been concern about global growth.
Sentiment is weak today.”  The rupee slumped 0.9 percent to 52.34 per dollar as of
2:08 p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The ringgit declined 0.5 percent to 3.0694,  Thailand ’s baht fell
0.4 percent to 30.67 and the Singapore dollar dropped 0.3
percent to S$1.2307.  The MSCI  Asia Pacific Index (MXAPJ)  Excluding Japan Index of shares
slumped 1.1 percent, the most since Sept. 20. Economic expansion
in developing East Asia will probably decelerate to 7.2 percent
from 8.3 percent in 2011, the Washington-based World Bank said
in a report today. That would be the slowest pace since 2001,
according to data from the lender.  Exports Outlook  The ringgit snapped a two-day advance as economists in a
Bloomberg News survey forecast Malaysia’s factory production
probably shrank 2 percent in August from a year earlier, the
first contraction since July 2011. The statistics department
will report the data on Oct. 11.  “The weak exports and expectations of worsening factory
output are damping demand for the ringgit,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-income strategist at Societe Generale SA in Hong
Kong. “Chances are the Malaysian currency will continue to
weaken in the near term.”  The  yuan  dropped 0.04 percent to 6.2872 per dollar,
according to China Foreign Exchange Trade System, versus 6.2849
on Sept. 28 before the financial markets closed for a weeklong
holiday.  Bank of Korea  South  Korea ’s won dropped 0.1 percent to 1,112.05 per
dollar, halting a rally that took it to an 11-month high last
week. The central bank will cut its seven-day repurchase rate to
2.75 percent from 3 percent on Oct. 11, according to 13 of 16
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Three forecast no change.  “There will be limits to the currency’s strengthening as
there is caution against government intervention at this
level,” said Byeon Ji Young, a Seoul-based foreign-exchange
analyst at Woori Futures Inc. “The Bank of Korea may cut
borrowing costs this week to prevent further inflows that lead
to won appreciation.”  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar dropped 0.1 percent to
NT$29.402, after gaining as much as 0.5 percent. The Philippine
peso and  Indonesia ’s rupiah weakened 0.1 percent to 41.470 and
9,600, respectively. Vietnam’s dong was steady at 20,890.  To contact the reporters on this story:
