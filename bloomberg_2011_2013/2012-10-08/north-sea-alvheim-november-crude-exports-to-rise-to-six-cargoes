Exports of  North Sea  Alvheim crude
for November will increase to six cargoes of 780,000 barrels
each, one more than this month, a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News showed.  Shipments will total 4.7 million barrels, or 156,000
barrels a day, according to the plan. That compares with 125,806
barrels a day in October. The November program includes one
consignment carried over from this monthâ€™s program.  Houston-based  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  operates the  field  in the
Norwegian North Sea. Loading programs are monthly schedules of
crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
