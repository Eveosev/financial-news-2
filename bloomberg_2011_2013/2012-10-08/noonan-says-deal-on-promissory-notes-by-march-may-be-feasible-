Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan
said the government aims to reach a deal by March to refinance
promissory notes used to rescue former Anglo Irish Bank.  “On the promissory notes, the political timeline is to get
a new arrangement put in place by March,” Noonan told reporters
in Luxembourg today. “I hope the March date is feasible.”  Ireland seeks European Union help to refinance 30 billion
euros ($39 billion) of promissory notes. It is also looking for
EU aid in refinancing other bank debt, which Noonan said remains
under discussion.  “Banking debt is falling into two fairly distinct areas of
discussion -- the promissory notes on the one hand and the
direct recapitalization of banks on the other hand,” he said.  The Irish finance minister said he’s confident the euro
area’s firewall fund, the European Stability Mechanism, will
eventually be allowed to recapitalize banks directly. EU leaders
in June pledged to create a common euro-area bank supervisor as
a precursor to allowing direct aid. Since then, officials have
debated how that system would handle so-called legacy assets
weighing down banks’ books.  “The policy position as set out by the heads of state of
government on June 29th is the policy that prevails,” Noonan
said. “We’ve had assurances of that from the commission and the
authorities. I don’t think the issue of the legacy will be dealt
with today.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
