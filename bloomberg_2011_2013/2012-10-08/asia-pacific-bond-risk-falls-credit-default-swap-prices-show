The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default declined, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index slid 2 basis points to
152 basis points as of 11:28 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. The gauge is set for its lowest close
since Sept. 19, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 1 to 129 as of 8:40 a.m. in Hong
Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show. The
benchmark is also headed for its lowest close since Sept. 19,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Markets are closed in Japan for a national holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
