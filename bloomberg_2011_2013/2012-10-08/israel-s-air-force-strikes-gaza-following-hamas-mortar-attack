Israel’s air force hit the  Gaza Strip 
for a second time in 24 hours after a barrage of mortar shells
and rockets struck the south of the country, the army said.  Five people were wounded in the air strike, Asharf al-
Qedra, spokesman for the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, told
reporters today. Earlier, as many as many as 30 mortar shells
and rockets hit southern Israel, causing no injuries, the army
said. Hamas and Islamic Jihad jointly claimed responsibility for
the attack.  Violence escalated two days after Israeli forces shot down
a drone as it entered the country’s airspace from the
 Mediterranean Sea . One Palestinian belonging to the Islamic
Jihad militant group died today after an Israeli missile
yesterday struck a motorcycle in the southern Gaza town of
Rafah. Another militant who is a member of the  Islamic Jihad  was
critically wounded and eight other people were injured.  The last outbreak of violence began almost three weeks ago
when two Palestinian militants belonging to Islamic Jihad were
killed and one was critically wounded in an Israeli air strike
in Gaza.  To contact the reporters on this story:
