Bulk wine prices in France,  Italy  and
Spain, the world’s largest producers, are climbing after adverse
summer weather reduced the European grape harvest, according to
wine broker Ciatti Co.  Italian pinot grigio from the 2012 vintage has increased to
1.30 to 1.45 euros ($1.69-$1.88) a liter (0.26 gallon) from 1.20
to 1.30 euros last month,  San Rafael , California-based Ciatti,
which says it’s the world’s largest broker of bulk wines, wrote
in an e-mailed report.  “As the 2012 harvest season continues in the Northern
Hemisphere, expectations remain very low for the European
crop,” Ciatti wrote. “The bulk wine market has already begun
to feel the effects.”  Italy’s wine production may slide 8 percent this year to
39.3 million hectoliters after drought and heat damaged grapes,
according to researcher Istituto di Servizi per il Mercato
Agricolo e Alimentare reported last month. French output is seen
falling 20 percent to 40.6 million hectoliters (1.07 billion
gallons), the lowest in at least 40 years, the  Agriculture
Ministry  said last week.  “This will be one of the smallest crops Italy has seen in
the last 50 years,” Ciatti wrote. “Most bottlers in Italy are
having difficulty in closing contracts with supermarkets due to
price increases.”  Generic white Italian wine from 2012 rose to 0.58 to 0.65
euros a liter from 0.55 to 0.60 euros in September, and compared
with 0.52 to 0.57 euros a liter for 2011 vintage in August.
Italian merlot prices were stable at 0.68 to 0.75 euros a liter
for new vintage, the broker said.  Rising Prices  “White wine is highest in demand, while also the most
problematic to find at the moment,” Ciatti said. “White wine
is difficult to buy, as prices seem to be increasing daily and
suppliers are looking to sell only for fast deliveries.”  French generic red wine from 2011 climbed to 0.60 to 0.65 a
liter from 0.55 to 0.65 euros last month, it said.  In  Spain , vineyard prices for bulk tempranillo and syrah
wine have climbed to between 0.65 and 0.70 euros a liter for
this year’s production, compared with 0.55 to 0.60 euros last
month for the 2011 vintage, the broker said.  Spanish wine production is forecast to slide 14 percent to
33.2 million hectoliters, Ciatti wrote, citing data from La
Semana Vitivinicola.  “As a consequence of the small crop, grape-buying prices
have exploded, increasing between 30 percent and 50 percent in
most of the producing regions,” the broker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
