Chancellor of the Exchequer  George
Osborne  said austerity is going to go on “for some years” as
the U.K. government has to reduce its debt burden.  “It’s going to go on for some years ahead,” Osborne said
in an interview with Sky News today. “It’s going to go on
beyond the next election because the debts we inherited are very
great.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
