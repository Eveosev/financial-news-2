German power for 2013 delivery
dropped as the price of European coal and emissions permits
fell.  Baseload next-year electricity, for supplies around the
clock, slid 0.6 percent as carbon declined as much as 1.4
percent and European coal 0.5 percent.  Year-ahead power lost 30 cents to 47.75 euros ($61.97) a
megawatt-hour at 10:42 a.m. Berlin time, according to broker
prices compiled by Bloomberg. Next-year electricity has traded
in a range from 47.30 to 48.23 euros since Sept. 18.  Carbon for December delivery slid as much as 11 cents to
7.70 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange while
next-year coal for delivery into Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp has
lost 45 cents to $96.75 a ton, broker data show.  Power can track fuel and emissions prices, which affect the
cost of production at plants which burn the  fossil fuel .  The German 2013  clean-dark spread , a calculation of the
profit utilities get from selling electricity after accounting
for the cost of coal and emissions permits, declined 2.4 percent
today to 10.43 euros a megawatt-hour at 10:42 a.m., data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Power for next month fell 1.7 percent to 49.65 euros and
the day-ahead contract fell 11.5 percent to 45.50 euros a
megawatt-hour, broker data show.  The minimum temperature in  Frankfurt  is predicted to drop
to 1 degree Celsius (34 Fahrenheit) tomorrow, compared with a
five-year average of 11 degrees, according to CustomWeather Inc.
