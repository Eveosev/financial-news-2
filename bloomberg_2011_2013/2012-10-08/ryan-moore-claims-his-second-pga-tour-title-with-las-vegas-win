Ryan Moore  held on for a one-stroke
victory over Brendon de Jonge in his hometown of  Las Vegas  to
claim his second career win on the U.S.  PGA Tour .  Moore shot a 5-under-par 66 during yesterday’s final round
at the Justin Timberlake Shriners Hospitals for Children Open.
He finished with a four-round total of 24-under 260 at TPC at
Summerlin to break the tournament’s previous scoring record of
261 set last year by Kevin Na.  Moore, 29, received $810,000 for his first victory since
his breakthrough at the 2009 Wyndham Championship. A 2005
graduate of the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, Moore said it
was especially satisfying to win in front of his family and  his
wife, Nichole, who is scheduled to give birth to the couple’s
first child in less than a month.  “It’s one of those weeks that it all just kind of went my
way,” said Moore, who held at least a share of the lead since
the opening round. “I was able to start out great and shoot 10
under the first day. That kind of put me into position so I
could just play solid golf from that point on and still have a
really good chance to win. That’s what I did.”  Zimbabwe’s de Jonge shot a final-round 67 to finish at 23
under. Jonas Blixt of Sweden was third at 20 under, two shots
better than Jason Day of  Australia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
