The Australian dollar rose after
touching the lowest level in almost three months before a report
this week that may show unemployment increased, fueling
speculation the  reserve bank  will reduce its key rate next
month.  The Aussie erased losses versus the majority of its 16
major peers as Treasurer Wayne Swan said on Oct. 7 that reduced
interest rates will help  Australia  weather deteriorating
conditions in the world economy. New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed
the kiwi, gained after its biggest weekly drop in more than four
months.  “The leading indicators for the labor market continue to
look weak and the  Reserve Bank of Australia  noted the softening
of conditions in its last post-meeting statement,” analysts led
by Peter von Maydell, global head of foreign-exchange strategy
at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote today in a note to clients.
“The projected rise in the  unemployment rate  is likely to
reinforce the RBA’s dovish bias.”  The Australian dollar appreciated 0.1 percent to $1.0190
yesterday in New York after falling as much as 0.4 percent to
$1.0149, the lowest since July 13. It decreased 0.4 percent to
79.81 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, rose 0.1 percent
to 81.92 U.S. cents after earlier declining 0.4 percent. It fell
0.3 percent to 64.16 yen.  Kiwi Leads  The kiwi has strengthened 3.6 percent this year, the
biggest increase among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The Aussie
has fallen 2.5 percent and the greenback is down 2.3 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  and the S&P GSCI Index of
raw materials each dropped 0.4 percent.  Australia’s  unemployment rate  probably climbed to 5.3
percent last month from 5.1 percent in August, according to the
median estimate of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  before
the Oct. 10 report. Payrolls probably increased by 5,000 in
September from the previous month, when they fell by 8,800,
another survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
