Fredrik Ohrneman replaced  Tom Sargent 
and became acting director of power and emissions markets at EON
Energy Trading SE.  Sargent left  Germany ’s biggest utility at the end of August
and Ohrneman was promoted from his position as a power trader,
Georg Opperman, a company spokesman said by phone from
Dusseldorf on Oct. 5.  Ohrneman was previously head of energy trading at Sydkraft
AB, bought by EON in 2001, and was chairman of the Nordic
Association of Electricity Traders from 2006 to 2009.  Sargent joined EON U.K. in 2004 and became director of
power and emissions of EON Energy Trading in Dusseldorf in 2008.  “I am currently enjoying some time at home with my
family,” Sargent said today by phone from Stratford-upon-Avon
in  England .  To contact the reporter on this story:
