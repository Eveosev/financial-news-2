The University of  South Carolina 
climbed three spots to No. 3 in the USA Today college football
coaches’ poll after a 35-7 win over Georgia, which was one of
three top-five teams to lose over the weekend.  South Carolina, coached by Steve Spurrier, improved to 6-0
with its Oct. 6 win in Columbia, South Carolina, and has won a
school-record 10 straight games dating back to last season.  The University of Alabama (5-0) and University of Oregon
(6-0) remain the top two teams in the coaches’ poll, with the
Crimson Tide receiving 58 of 59 first-place votes. Alabama was
off last week while Oregon, which got the other first-place
vote, rolled past Washington 52-21.  West Virginia University  (5-0) is ranked fourth after a
48-45 win over Texas. The Mountaineers are followed by Kansas
State, Florida and  Notre Dame , all of which are also 5-0.  Louisiana State fell five spots to No. 8 after losing 14-6
at Florida, while Florida State dropped to 11th from fourth
after its 17-16 defeat at North Carolina State. Georgia dropped
seven spots to 12th after having its run of 15 consecutive
regular-season wins snapped by South Carolina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
