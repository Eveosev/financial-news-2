Russia’s Economy Ministry and
property fund stand behind the state’s sale of rail company SG-
Trans, which was halted by a Moscow court at OAO Rosneft’s
request, Kommersant reported, citing an unidentified official in
the ministry.  State companies such as Rosneft don’t have a role in such
asset sales, Kommersant cited the official as saying. AFK
Sistema won the right to buy 100 percent of SG-Trans, the
newspaper said, adding that Rosneft declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
