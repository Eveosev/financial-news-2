New York  Giants safety Will Hill was
suspended four games without pay after testing positive for a
banned stimulant, and will be replaced on the roster by a player
who just completed a suspension for the same substance.  Hill, a 22-year-old rookie, will be eligible to return to
the team Nov. 5 after his ban for violating the  National
Football League ’s performance-enhancing drug rules, the NFL said
yesterday in a statement e-mailed by the Giants.  To fill his spot on the 53-man roster, the Giants added
safety Tyler Sash, who just completed a four-game suspension of
his own. Sash and Hill both said they tested positive for
Adderall, which is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder, or ADHD.  Hill said in a statement released by the Giants that he had
a doctor’s prescription for Adderall prior to signing with the
team and had discussed it in a meeting with Charles Way, the
player development director. Way then reviewed the league’s
banned-substance list.  “I knew at that point that this may be an issue,” Hill
said. He said he had already lost an appeal of the ban.  Hill joined the team on May 14. He has played in all five
games this season for the Giants (3-2), recording seven tackles
on defense as well as four tackles and a forced fumble on
special teams. He forced the fumble on a kickoff in yesterday’s
41-27 win against the  Cleveland Browns , leading to a Giants
score.  To contact the reporter on this story:
