Palm oil  fell, snapping a three-day
gain, on concern stockpiles in Malaysia, the largest producer
after  Indonesia , reached a record. Futures in Dalian dropped to
the lowest since 2010 as the market reopened after a holiday.  The contract for December delivery fell as much as 1.3
percent to 2,384 ringgit ($777) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and traded at 2,386 ringgit at 3:41 p.m.
in Kuala Lumpur. Prices dropped 5.2 percent last week after
falling to the lowest close since November 2009 on Oct. 2.  Palm oil has declined 21 percent since the end of August as
a global slowdown weakened demand for the oil used in candy to
biofuel. Inventories in  Malaysia  probably increased 15 percent
to a record 2.43 million tons in September from 2.12 million
tons in August, the median of estimates from five analysts and
two plantation companies showed. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board is
scheduled to release the data on Oct. 10.  “The market is expecting higher stockpiles of at least 2.4
million tons,” said Ryan Long, vice president of futures and
options at OSK Investment Bank Bhd. “Stocks will continue to
build up at the end of this month,” he said.  Malaysia’s  output  climbed 10 percent to 1.83 million tons
in September from 1.66 million tons the previous month, while
 exports  rose 4.9 percent to 1.5 million tons from 1.43 million
tons, the survey showed. Reserves reached an all-time high of
2.27 million tons in November 2008, according to the board.  Soybean oil  for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to 51.09
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
November delivery dropped 0.8 percent to $15.3875 a bushel.  Palm oil for January delivery plunged as much as 4.4
percent to close at 6,872  yuan  ($1,093) a ton on the  Dalian
Commodity Exchange , the lowest level for the most-active
contract since August 2010. Soybean oil for delivery in the same
month fell 2.1 percent to 9,088 yuan a ton. Financial markets in
China reopened today after a weeklong holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
