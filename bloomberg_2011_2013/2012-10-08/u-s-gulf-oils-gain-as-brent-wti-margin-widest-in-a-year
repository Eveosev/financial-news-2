U.S. Gulf Coast oils strengthened as
the discount for West Texas Intermediate versus Brent widened to
the largest gap in almost a year.  The spread between the benchmarks widened 33 cents to
$22.47 a barrel at 1:56 p.m. in  New York , the biggest
differential since Oct. 20. When Brent gains against WTI it
typically strengthens the value of U.S. grades that compete with
foreign oils priced using the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet increased $1.20 to $21.20 over WTI at
2:01 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the largest premium for the grade since April 9. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 75 cents to $21 a barrel.  Poseidon’s premium rose 5 cents to $14.30. Mars Blend
increased by 80 cents to $14.80 a barrel over WTI, and Southern
Green Canyon advanced 75 cents to $13.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
widened 50 cents to $18.50 above WTI.  Bakken oil’s premium was steady at $2.50 a barrel.  The discount to WTI for Western Canada Select, a heavy oil
blend from  Alberta , was unchanged at $14.75. Syncrude’s premium
to the U.S. benchmark was steady at $5.75 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
