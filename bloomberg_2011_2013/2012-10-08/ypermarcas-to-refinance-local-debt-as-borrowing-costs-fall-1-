Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3) ,  Brazil ’s largest
consumer-health company, said it plans to pay off some  local
bonds , its third such redemption in the past year as it seeks to
cut debt costs.  The company will prepay or refinance about 200 million
reais ($98 million) of bonds by year-end, Chief Financial
Officer Martim Mattos said in an Oct. 4 interview at Bloomberg’s
office in  Sao Paulo . The transaction follows Hypermarcas’s move
in July to  fully redeem  200 million reais of local bonds that
paid 113.72 percent of the  interbank rate , known as the CDI. In
October 2011, the company refinanced 200 million reais of
debentures, cutting the rate to 105 percent of the CDI from
113.7 percent.  Hypermarcas is seeking to reduce its interest expenses
after taking on debt to make acquisitions to gain market share
and boost revenues, Chief Executive Officer Claudio Bergamo said
in the same interview. Hypermarcas, which makes more than  190 
products as varied as Jontex condoms to generic Valium, spent
$4.9 billion on 21 acquisitions in the past decade, the most
among Brazilian consumer-goods companies, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “This is a company we expect in two or three years will
have very low debt,” Bergamo said, adding that he also sees
“great potential for dividends.”  Record-Low Yield  The yield on the company’s 2021 dollar bond declined 3.19
percentage points, or 319 basis points, since the end of
November to a record low of 5.3924 percent on Oct. 4.
Hypermarcas expects net debt to fall to two times its earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as soon as
the end of 2013, from a ratio of three times in the second
quarter, Bergamo said.  Hypermarcas shares rose 2.3 percent to 15.95 at 3:25 p.m.
in Sao Paulo trading, bringing its year-to-date gain to 88
percent. That’s the best performance this year on the benchmark
Bovespa index, which is up 3.8 percent.  The company is now focused on organic growth and absorbing
recent acquisitions, as well as boosting  cash flow , he said.
Investments will fall to 150 million reais in 2013 from as much
as 220 million reais this year, Bergamo said. Annual spending
will then decline to a range of 80 million to 100 million reais,
he said.  Asset Sales  The company plans to close or sell 10 of its 14 existing
consumer product plants and transfer the output to a new, larger
facility that will open by the end of next year in the city of
Senador Canedo, in Brazil’s Goias state, Bergamo said.
Hypermarcas may raise as much as 200 million reais from the
asset sales, the executives said.  Hypermarcas aims to produce its own packages and simplify
logistics with the new plant and a distribution center in
Goiania, also in Goias, Bergamo said.  “Consolidation of sales and structure will help boost
consumer goods sales in the medium and long term,” Bergamo
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
