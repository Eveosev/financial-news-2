Winton Capital Management LLC, the
$28 billion hedge fund founded by David Harding, earned 351
million pounds ($564 million) of fees last year after its assets
under management surged 65 percent.  The revenue compared with 282 million pounds of fees in
2010, London-based Winton said in a U.K. Companies House filing
published yesterday. Winton’s after-tax profit rose 23 percent
to 162 million pounds in 2011, the filing said.  Winton makes money by charging clients fees for managing
assets and for any investment gains in its hedge funds. The firm
was one of the world’s most successful hedge funds at raising
money from investors in 2011, as assets under management soared
to $28 billion from $17 billion a year earlier, according to the
filing.  Winton invests in  futures markets  tied to commodities,
currencies and stocks, relying on computer algorithms to decide
when to buy and sell. The firm, the fourth-biggest hedge fund in
 Europe  by assets, employs about 100 scientific researchers,
including Harding, a Cambridge University-educated physicist.  The Winton Futures Fund Ltd., the firm’s main hedge fund,
declined about 3.5 percent through September of this year after
gaining 6.3 percent in 2011.  Market Swings  So-called systematic funds that also rely on algorithms
have struggled over the past two years during Europe’s sovereign
debt crisis, as  market sentiment  swings from pessimism to
optimism based on announcements from central banks and
politicians, making it difficult to follow trends. The Newedge
CTA Index, which tracks some of the largest trend-following
hedge funds, rose 0.1 percent through September after falling
4.5 percent in 2011.  Harding, 51, earned 87 million pounds in 2011, paying 34
million pounds in taxes to the U.K. government, according to an
article published Sept. 30 by the Sunday Times. He started
Winton in 1997 after helping design an earlier systematic-
trading system that was purchased by London-based  Man Group Plc (EMG) ,
the world’s biggest publicly-traded hedge fund.  Winton spokesman Robin Eggar declined to comment on
Harding’s 2011 earnings. While Winton generates its revenue
overseas, the company and its employees paid more than 520
million pounds of taxes in the U.K. for the six years ended in
2011, Eggar said.  BlueCrest Capital Management LLP, Europe’s third-biggest
hedge fund with $32 billion of assets, made 502 million pounds
of fees in 2011, according to a September Companies House
filing.  Michael Platt , BlueCrest’s founder, relocated to Geneva
from  London  in 2010 after the U.K. imposed higher taxes on its
wealthiest citizens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
