France  should open the auto-repair
market to more service and parts providers, the nation’s
competition authority said.  Lawmakers should make the change gradually to minimize job
losses at carmakers like  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  and  Renault SA (RNO)  and
give part makers time to increase production, the regulator said
today in presenting the results of its study.  Carmakers “have a veritable legal monopoly on more than 70
percent of the sales of parts, and a duopoly with parts makers
on the remaining 30 percent” of the market for visible parts --
such as mirrors, lights and bumpers -- the authority said in a
 statement  on its findings.  Peugeot and Renault face declining car sales in  Europe  and
rely in part on service revenue to offset slumping vehicle
deliveries. The French carmakers tend to generate higher profit
margins from repair and maintenance than car sales, according to
the study.  Trade groups representing the  auto industry  criticized the
report, saying in an e-mailed statement that its “erroneous and
unrealistic recommendations wouldn’t bring any benefit to
consumers and would gravely injure the French automobile
industry, business and employment.”  UFC-Que Choisir, a consumer advocacy group, said the report
“confirms the calcified nature of these markets.”  The authority said France, unlike other countries, allows
for copyright protection covering visible parts and lawmakers
should lift that protection over several years. Carmakers should
also clarify warranty contracts regarding whether owners can
service their cars outside the manufacturer’s own repair network
without jeopardizing their coverage, the regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
