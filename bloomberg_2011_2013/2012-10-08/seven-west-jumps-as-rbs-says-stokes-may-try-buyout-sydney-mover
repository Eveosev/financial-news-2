Seven West Media Ltd. (SWM) , controlled by
billionaire  Kerry Stokes , jumped the most since July in Sydney
trading after Royal Bank of  Scotland  Group Plc said the
television broadcaster’s owners may attempt a buyout.  The stock rose 4.1 percent to A$1.275 at the local close,
the biggest gain since July 20. Before today, the shares had
sunk 60 percent this year.  Seven West has tumbled so much that Stokes’s  Seven Group
Holdings Ltd. (SVW) , with a 33 percent stake, and buyout firm KKR &
Co., with 12 percent, may make an “opportunistic” A$825
million ($837 million) bid for the  remaining shares , RBS said in
an Oct. 5 report. The appeal of Seven West’s television business
would be central to any bid from Stokes, who is also the
chairman of the media company, RBS said.  “The price has fallen to a level where the numbers start
to look pretty attractive,” Fraser McLeish, a Sydney-based
analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, said by phone today.
“They’ve got a good platform and the TV ratings remain pretty
strong.”  Simon Francis, a spokesman for Perth, Western Australia-
based Seven West, didn’t return a call seeking comment on the
RBS report.  Ian Smith , an Adelaide-based spokesman for KKR,
declined to comment.  Stokes and KKR could generate an internal rate of return of
39 percent on their additional investment, according to McLeish.
That assumes they pay A$1.50 a share for the 55 percent stake,
and sell for eight times Seven West’s earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization in two years, he wrote in
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
