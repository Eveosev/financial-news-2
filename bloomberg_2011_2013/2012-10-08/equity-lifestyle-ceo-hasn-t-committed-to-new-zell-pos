Equity LifeStyle Properties Inc. (ELS) ,
founded by  Sam Zell , said its chief executive officer hasn’t
made any commitments to become CEO of Equity International,
another firm started by the billionaire investor.  Zell plans to recommend Equity LifeStyle’s Thomas Heneghan
for the CEO position at Equity International after last month’s
departure of Gary Garrabrant from the closely held global real
estate investment firm, the Wall Street Journal reported
yesterday. Heneghan told Chicago-based Equity LifeStyle, which
owns manufactured-home communities, that he hasn’t committed to
taking the new post, the company said in a statement today.  “Even if my role as CEO changes, given my strong
relationship with our chairman I expect to be able to continue
contributing to the company’s success in the future as a member
of the board,” Heneghan said in the statement.  Zell and Garrabrant founded Equity International in 1999 to
invest in real estate in fast-growing  emerging markets . The
company has teamed with local operating partners on investments
in 14 countries, including  Mexico , Brazil, China and India,
according to its website.  Zell, 71, took over as interim CEO of Chicago-based Equity
International after Garrabrant’s departure. Zell also is founder
of Equity Group Investments LLC, a private investment firm
that’s also based in Chicago and is more than 40 years old.  To contact the reporter on this story:
