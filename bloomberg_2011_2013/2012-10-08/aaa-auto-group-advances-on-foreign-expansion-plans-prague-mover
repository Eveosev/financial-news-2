AAA Auto Group NV (AAA)  rose to its highest
level in about two months after announcing plans to enter
Hungary,  Poland , Ukraine and add branches in the three states
where it already has operations.  The stock rose 0.93 koruna, or 4.3 percent, to 22.38 koruna
in Prague trading. That’s the highest level since Aug.4.  AAA plans to reopen its business in Hungary in 2014, start
operations in Poland in 2015 and in Ukraine the following year,
the company said in a statement published on its website late on
Oct.5. AAA also plans to add new branches in the  Czech Republic ,
Slovakia and Russia.  “It is a challenge they set for themselves but if this
scenario is fulfilled it is a definitely positive news for the
stock,” Cyrrus AS’ analyst Jiri Simara said by phone today.
“The company would grow threefold and the earnings per share
would rise as well.”  Simara has the stock “under review.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
