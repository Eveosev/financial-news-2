European investor confidence rose for
a second month in October after the  European Central Bank 
announced its plan to buy bonds of countries affected by the
sovereign debt crisis, the Sentix research institute said.  An  index  measuring sentiment in the euro-area economy
increased to minus 22.2 from minus 23.2 in September, the
Limburg, Germany-based institute said in an e-mailed statement
today. Economists had forecast a gain to minus 20.9, according
to the median of 10  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
