Chinese equities  posted the biggest
drop in more than two weeks in New York, led by  SouFun (SFUN)  Holdings
Ltd., on concern falling home prices will exacerbate a sixth
quarter of slowing growth in Asia’s largest economy.  The Bloomberg  China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. retreated 1.1 percent to 92.13
yesterday, the steepest drop since Sept. 20. Real estate website
SouFun sank the most in a month, while Huaneng Power
International Inc. fell as coal prices increased.  China  Life
Insurance Co. traded at a  discount  to its Hong Kong stock for
the first time in a week. Airlines rallied as data showed
passenger numbers increased during the holiday week.  New home prices in China rose 0.17 percent last month from
August and dropped 1.4 percent from a year ago, according to a
report released yesterday by SouFun, which tracks prices in 100
cities. The government is preparing for a leadership transition
on Nov. 8 as the faltering U.S. recovery and  European debt
crisis  sap global demand for exports. China’s economy expanded
7.6 percent in the second quarter, the slowest pace since 2009.  “The housing situation in China won’t become a crisis as
has happened here, but it will negatively affect some
companies,” Gustavo Galindo, who helps manage $8 billion in
emerging market assets at Russell Investments in New York, said
by phone yesterday. “Sentiment on China remains negative.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slid 1.1 percent to $34.99,
the biggest one-day drop since Sept. 25. The  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index (SPX)  dipped 0.3 percent to 1,455.88 as European finance
ministers met to discuss the region’s debt crisis.  ‘Slightly Disappointing’  Beijing-based SouFun slumped 5.8 percent to $18.10, the
largest decline since Aug. 21.  E-House China Holdings Ltd. (EJ) , a
property agency service provider based in  Shanghai , slid 3.1
percent to $4.39, losing the most in a week.  September home prices in Beijing rose 0.16 percent from the
prior month and those in Shanghai added 0.07 percent, according
to SouFun’s statement yesterday. Property sales in China’s major
cities fell in the first week of October, the so-called Golden
Week holiday, dropping 70 percent in Beijing from the weekly
average for October last year, and sliding 60 percent in
Shanghai, SouFun said.  China’s October home sales may turn out to be weaker than
expected, Credit Suisse Group AG analysts led by Du Jinsong
wrote in a report yesterday.  “Home sales during Golden Week were slightly
disappointing,” John-Paul Smith, Deutsche Bank AG’s emerging-
market strategist, said by phone from  London  yesterday. “The
big picture on the ground unfortunately continued to
deteriorate.”  Coal Rises  Huaneng Power International Inc. (600011) , China’s largest
electricity producer, plunged 3.9 percent to $29.43 in New York,
the biggest loss since Sept. 14.  China’s benchmark power-station coal price rose for the
first time in five weeks as coal with an energy value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram at the port of Qinhuangdao climbed to
between 630 yuan ($100) and 640 yuan a metric ton as of Oct. 7,
according to the China Coal Transport and Distribution
Association yesterday.  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL) , which runs gambling
facilities in  Macau  -- the only Chinese city where casinos are
legal -- fell 2.5 percent to a two-week low of $12.87.  October gaming revenue in Macau is likely to post zero to 5
percent growth from a year ago based on data for the first week,
Cameron McKnight, an analyst at Well Fargo & Co., wrote in a
report yesterday. That would be lower than the 5 percent rate
estimated by analysts, he wrote.  China Life Drops  China Life, the country’s largest insurer, declined 2.2
percent to $43.51 in New York, the largest slump in a month. Its
American depositary receipts, each representing 15 underlying
shares, traded 0.1 percent  below  its Hong Kong stock, the first
discount in eight days.  ADRs of China Southern Airlines Co., Asia’s biggest carrier
by passenger numbers, jumped 3.9 percent to a two-month high of
$23.85.  China Eastern Airlines Corp. (670) , the second-largest carrier
in the country, climbed 1.2 percent to $16.28, the highest since
Aug. 22.  The number of air passengers in China rose 27 percent
during the Golden Week holiday, according to data from the
nation’s Civil Aviation Administration.  China Southern carried 1.65 million passengers during the
holiday, the company said in an e-mail statement yesterday.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  lost 0.6 percent to 2,074.42
in its first trading day after a week-long holiday, extending
its slump this year to 5.7 percent. Companies in the Shanghai
gauge traded at 11.3 times their earnings, the lowest level
since at least 1997.  Down Year  Haitong Securities Co. strategist Chen Ruiming, who
correctly predicted on Aug. 1 the index would fall below the
2,000 level, says the measure is poised to drop a further 14
percent to 1,800 this year. China’s stocks will end down for a
third year, according to Bank of Communications Co.’s Hao Hong,
the only forecaster among 13 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg
at the start of the year to predict declines for equities in
2012.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies
slid 1.3 percent to 9,839.84, falling the most in two weeks.  The Chinese  yuan  yesterday climbed to 6.2812 per dollar in
Shanghai, the strongest level since China unified official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993, before ending the
trading day 0.04 percent weaker at 6.2872, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  To contact the reporters on this story:
