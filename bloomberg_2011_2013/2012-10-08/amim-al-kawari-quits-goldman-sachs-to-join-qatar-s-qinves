Tamim Al Kawari said he left as head
of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Qatar office to join Qinvest as
the Qatari company’s deputy chief executive officer.  Al Kawari didn’t say when the transfer occurred in a
telephone interview from the Qatari capital Doha today.  Al Kawari joins Qinvest, which counts  Qatar Islamic Bank (QIBK)  as
its biggest shareholder, as it seeks to form a joint venture
with Cairo-based EFG-Hermes Holding SAE in which the Qatari
investment bank will hold a 60 percent stake.  Qinvest is also advising Barwa Bank on a share listing and
recently helped manage Qatar Islamic’s $750 million Sukuk sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
