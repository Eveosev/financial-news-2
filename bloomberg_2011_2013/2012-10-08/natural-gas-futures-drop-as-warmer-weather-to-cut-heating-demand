Natural gas futures fell for the
third time in four days as forecasts for warmer-than-normal
weather signaled reduced demand for the heating fuel.  Gas declined as much as 2 percent. Temperatures will be
above normal in the central U.S. from Oct. 13 through Oct. 17
before spreading to the East Coast over the next 11 to 15 days,
according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .
The Energy Department expects  gas stockpiles  to rise to a record
before demand begins to rise with colder weather.  “Winter is one of the main events in the natural gas
market, it’s just not there yet,” said Tom Saal, senior vice
president of energy trading at INTL Hencorp Futures LLC in
Miami. “We have a lot of inventory. It’s keeping the market
actually a little bit below where it was a year ago.”  Natural gas for November delivery dropped 3.1 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $3.365 per million British thermal units at 9:55
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures are down
3.3 percent from a year ago.  The low temperature in Chicago on Oct. 17 may be 49 degrees
Fahrenheit (9 Celsius), 4 above normal, and  Detroit  may be 6
above normal at 50 degrees, according to AccuWeather Inc. in
 State College ,  Pennsylvania . New York’s low on Oct. 22 will be
54 degrees, 6 above the usual reading.  Heating needs in the lower 48 states will be 59 percent
below normal Oct. 14 through Oct. 18, data from Weather
Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri , show. The months from November
through March make up the  peak period  for U.S. gas consumption.  U.S. inventories totaled 3.653 billion cubic feet in the
week ended Sept. 28, 8.3 percent above the five-year average for
the period, the department said last week. Record gas demand
from electricity generators because of an unusually hot summer
and decade-low seasonal prices reduced the supply  surplus  from a
six-year high of 61 percent on March 30.  The department expects stockpiles to reach an all-time high
of 3.95 trillion cubic feet by the end of October before the
heating season, according to its monthly  Short-Term Energy
Outlook  Sept. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
