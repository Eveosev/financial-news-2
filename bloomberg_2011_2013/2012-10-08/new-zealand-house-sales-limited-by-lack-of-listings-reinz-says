New Zealand house sales rose at the
slowest annual pace since April last year as a shortage of new
listings stokes prices, according to the Real Estate Institute.  Sales in September increased 8 percent from a year earlier
to 5,653, half the pace of the gain in August, the institute
said in a statement on its website. Prices rose 0.6 percent from
August and 5 percent from a year earlier to a record, the
Auckland-based institute said, citing an index.  Sales fell from August, whereas usually they increase at
the start of the southern hemisphere spring when owners prefer
to sell homes, the institute said. Rising house prices will be
watched by the central bank after new Governor Graeme Wheeler
agreed to monitor asset prices as part of his agreement with the
government signed Sept. 20.  “The traditional rush of spring listings has not
eventuated this year and the market is tightening as buyers face
a limited choice,” said Institute Chief Executive Officer Helen
O’Sullivan. “This has been reflected by increases in the median
price across much of the country.”  The average time to sell a house fell to 33 days from 35
days in August, the institute said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
