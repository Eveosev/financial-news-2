ZTE Corp. (763) , China’s second-largest
maker of telephone equipment, plans to release digital set-top
boxes for 3D television services that will run  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
Android operating system.  The boxes to be sold “in the near future” will allow
video-calling functions, and support the HTML5 language for
displaying Internet content, Shenzhen-based ZTE said in a
statement today.  The announcement comes after ZTE reached agreement allowing
the company access to the digital-TV systems of  Kudelski SA (KUD) ’s
Nagra division, according to the statement. The agreement
enables the Chinese company to sell intelligent set-top boxes to
customers of Nagra, which has a 70 percent share of Europe’s
market for cable-TV devices, and 18 percent globally, ZTE said.  ZTE plans to release a new mobile operating system for
smartphones with Mozilla Corp., developer of the Firefox Web
browser, to reduce reliance on Android, the Chinese company said
Sept. 19. Android now accounts for about 90 percent of ZTE’s
smartphone operating systems.  ZTE’s  shares  traded in  Hong Kong  fell 6 percent, the most
since Aug. 27, to close at HK$12.60, while the Shenzhen-traded
stock gained 2.6 percent to 11.45 yuan. A U.S. House
intelligence committee report to be released today says the
company poses a security threat and “cannot be trusted to be
free of foreign state influence,” according to a draft provided
by the panel.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
