Impax Laboratories Inc. (IPXL)  was sued by
 Avanir Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AVNR)  for allegedly infringing a new
patent for the drug Nuedexta, used to control abnormal emotional
outbursts.  Lawyers for Avanir contend Impax wrongly plans to market a
generic version of the drug, for which a patent was awarded in
July, before the patent expires in 2023, according to a
complaint filed today in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  “Impax’s proposed product is especially adapted for a use
that infringes the patent,” Avanir contends in court papers,
saying there is “no substantial non-infringing use” for the
product.  Avanir, based in  Aliso Viejo , California, is asking a judge
to rule that the patent is infringed, to order Hayward,
California-based Impax not to use the technology and to award
unspecified damages.  Reached by telephone, Impax spokesman Mark Donohue declined
to comment on the lawsuit.  Avanir reported about $32 million in revenue for the year
ending on June 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Impax reported about $573 million in the same period.  The case is Avanir v. Impax, U.S. District Court, District
of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 8,227,484.  To contact the reporter on this story:
