The New York Yankees scored five runs
in the top of the ninth inning to beat the Baltimore Orioles 7-2
in the opening game of their Major League Baseball playoff
series.   Russell Martinâ€™s solo home run to lead off the ninth
snapped a 2-2 tie at Camden Yards in Baltimore. Ichiro Suzuki
drove in another run with an infield single while Robinson Cano
added a two-run double off Orioles relief pitcher Jim Johnson,
who had allowed only one earned run since the end of July. Nick
Swisher capped the inning with a sacrifice fly.   The start of the game was delayed two hours and 41 minutes
because of rain. Game 2 in the best-of-five American League
Division Series is scheduled for tonight in Baltimore before
returning to New York.    The Orioles are back in the postseason for the first time
since 1997, while the Yankees are in the playoffs for the 17th
time in the past 18 years and seeking the 28th World Series
title in franchise history.   New York finished two games ahead of the Orioles in the AL
East, clinching the division title on the final day of the
regular season. The teams split their 18 regular-season
meetings, with the Yankees winning six of nine games in
Baltimore.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
