The Liikanen report on European
banking doesn’t call into question BNP Paribas SA’s universal
banking model and won’t hurt its ability to service corporate
clients, said Francois Villeroy de Galhau, chief operating
officer of  France ’s largest bank.  “The report validates the value of universal banking, and
recognizes that corporates require a wide variety of activities
from risk management to financing,” Villeroy said at a press
meeting in Paris today.  Last week, a European Union-commissioned group, led by Bank
of Finland Governor Erkki Liikanen, presented a report that
recommends a “legal separation of certain particularly risky
financial activities from deposit-taking banks within the
banking group.”  Villeroy said the activities that Liikanen suggested be
walled off “have nothing to do with financing corporate
clients.”  French President  Francois Hollande , elected in May, has
pledged to overhaul the country’s banking industry to better
separate  consumer banking  from the riskier investment-banking
operations.  The EU report found that Paris-based BNP Paribas and
Societe Generale SA, together with Barclays Plc of  London ,
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc of Edinburgh had the highest proportion of trading
assets, accounting for more than 30 percent of total assets. The
value of trading assets fluctuates with their market
performance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
