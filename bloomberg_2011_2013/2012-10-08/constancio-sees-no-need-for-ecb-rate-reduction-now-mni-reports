European Central Bank Vice President
 Vitor Constancio  said the key interest rate is appropriate for
now, Market News International reported, citing an interview.  “If of course the economic data change, if the economy
would weaken and inflation would then abate as a consequence,
then things can change,” he said, according to MNI.  A rate cut would contribute “not much” for now and
“rates are already quite accommodative, quite low,” MNI cited
Constancio as saying. Talk of a negative deposit rate is mainly
an intellectual exercise “right now,” he said.  Constancio said the inflation rate has seen a “very slight
increase, but with no real meaning,” and repeated that the ECB
sees inflation slowing below 2 percent in 2013, MNI reported.
The ECB is “waiting for countries to move” after it unveiled a
bond-purchase program to fight the debt crisis, and “right now
we cannot do anything else,” MNI cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
