Swiss unemployment held steady in
September, suggesting companies are holding onto their employees
even as the economy cools.  The jobless rate, adjusted for seasonal swings, remained at
2.9 percent, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs in
Bern said in an e-mailed statement today. Thatâ€™s below the
median forecast of 3 percent by 11 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. Unadjusted unemployment was also unchanged from
August at 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
