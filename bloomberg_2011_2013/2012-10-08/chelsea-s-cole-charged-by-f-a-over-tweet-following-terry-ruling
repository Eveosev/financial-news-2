Chelsea defender  Ashley Cole  has been
charged by England’s Football Association following comments he
made on social networking site Twitter.  Cole used an abusive term to refer to the governing body
Oct. 5 after it published a 63-page report detailing why an
independent panel found the 31-year-old’s Chelsea teammate  John Terry  guilty of racially abusing a rival player. The commission
raised questions about a statement Cole provided in support of
Terry.  “Chelsea FC’s Ashley Cole has been charged by the F.A. in
relation to a Twitter comment which was improper and/or brought
the game into disrepute,” read a statement posted on the
governing body’s website.  The England defender has until 4 p.m. on Oct. 11 to respond
to the charge. He deleted the posting about an hour after it was
posted, and issued an apology through his lawyer.  Terry received a four-game suspension and a 220,000 pound
($353,000) fine after the panel found that he had racially
insulted Queens Park Rangers defender  Anton Ferdinand  at a game
last October.  Terry was cleared by a  London  court of racially abusing
Ferdinand on July 13. Cole, who is of mixed race heritage, was
called as a witness. The burden of proof required in the
criminal case was higher than the “balance of probabilities”
used to guide F.A. hearings.  Terry’s defense that he had not racially insulted the QPR
defender was “improbable, implausible and contrived,” the
commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
