OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, snapped a seven-day rally on concern the global economy
is slowing as the country struggles to recover from recession.  The shares fell 1.1 percent by 11:42 a.m. in Budapest after
rising 9.2 percent in the seven days through Oct. 5. The
benchmark BUX stock  index  declined 1 percent.  European stocks dropped the most this month as the World
Bank cut its East Asian growth forecast and euro-area finance
ministers meet to discuss the region’s debt crisis. Hungary’s
government forecast on Oct. 5 that the economy will contract 1.2
percent in 2012, compared with a previous estimate of 0.1
percent growth, and that 2013 will see 1 percent expansion,
rather than the 1.6 percent projected initially.  The  World Bank ’s lower forecasts contributed to worsening
stock market sentiment, Jozsef Miro, an analyst at Erste Group
Bank AG, wrote in a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
