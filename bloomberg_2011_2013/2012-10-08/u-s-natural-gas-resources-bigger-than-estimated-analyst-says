The U.S. has almost three times as
much recoverable natural gas as the government estimates, enough
to place it third in the world, a Canadian analyst said.  Data from more than 24,000 recently drilled wells show the
U.S. has 890 trillion cubic feet equivalent of recoverable
natural gas, said Manuj Nikhanj, head of energy research at
brokerage ITG  Investment Technology Group Inc. (ITG)  in Calgary. The
Energy Information Administration  estimated  proved reserves of
317.6 trillion in 2010, a record high.  “As the years go on, the U.S. will revise their numbers
upward, there’s no doubt in my mind,” Nikhanj said.  Nikhanj’s estimate would move the U.S. up from fifth on  BP
Plc (BP/) ’s list of countries with the world’s largest gas reserves,
behind  Russia  and  Iran  and ahead of Qatar and Turkmenistan. BP’s
Statistical Review of World Energy estimated U.S. gas reserves
at 299.8 trillion cubic feet at the end of 2011.  In Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale, ITG calculated reserves
per well at two to three times the EIA estimates, Nikhanj said.
The EIA also “grossly understated” resources in the Eagle Ford
and Permian basins in  Texas  and the Bakken formation in  North
Dakota , Nikhanj said.  Rising shale output has helped increase the amount of gas
in storage to a  record seasonal high  of 3.653 trillion cubic
feet. In March the storage amount was 60 percent above the five-
year average.  Nikhanj also said the Energy Department understated U.S.
oil reserves at 25.2 billion barrels. He estimated 30 billion
and BP 30.9 billion. About 90 percent of the oil can be
extracted profitably with prices at $100 a barrel and more than
half the gas is profitable at $4 per million British thermal
units, he said.  Crude oil for November delivery settled at $89.88 a barrel
Oct. 5 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Natural gas settled
at $3.396 per million Btu.  Nikhanj predicted U.S. gas production will reach 76.5
billion cubic feet a day in 2025, up 17 percent from 65.2
billion last year. He said oil production excluding  Alaska  will
reach 10 million barrels a day in 2025, nearly double the 2011
average of 5.09 million. Most of the increase will come from the
Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian basins, he said.  U.S.  total oil production  reached a 15-year high of 6.52
million barrels a day in the week ended Sept. 28, the Energy
Department reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
