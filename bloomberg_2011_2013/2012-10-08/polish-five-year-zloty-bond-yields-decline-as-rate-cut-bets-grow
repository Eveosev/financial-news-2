Polish five-year bond yields declined
as some of the central bank’s policy makers signaled they may
cut interest rates next month.  The yield on notes maturing in April 2017 fell one basis
point to 4.18 percent as of 4:15 p.m. in Warsaw, near a record
low of 4.166 percent reached last week. The zloty gained 0.2
percent to 4.0718 per euro.  Adam Glapinski , who backed a rate increase in May, said
today in an interview with PAP newswire that he isn’t
“absolutely against” cutting borrowing costs in November if
the bank’s projections show a “serious” economic slowdown next
year and no threat to its inflation target. Fellow rate-setter
Elzbieta Chojna-Duch told TVN CNBC television the central bank
should consider a series of rate cuts after a “radical
reduction” to kick-off the easing.  “Markets will continue to support lower rates in the
front-end, given the broad evidence of slowdown in the Polish
economy,” Luis Costa, senior emerging-market strategist at
Citigroup Inc. in  London , wrote in an e-mailed note today. “We
believe the inflation report out at the beginning of November
will enable a more dovish stance” by central bankers.  Investors in interest-rate derivatives increased their bets
for a cut next month after policy makers unexpectedly kept
borrowing costs unchanged last week. One-month forward rate
agreements fell to 8 basis points below Warsaw Interbank Offered
Rate today from less than one basis point on Oct. 5, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
