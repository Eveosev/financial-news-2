South  Korea ’s government bonds fell
as an unexpected drop in U.S. unemployment brightened the
outlook for exports. The won weakened from an 11-month high.  The jobless rate in the world’s biggest economy dropped to
7.8 percent in September, the lowest since January 2009, data
showed Oct. 5. The  Bank of Korea  will probably cut its benchmark
interest  rate  by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.75 percent
at an Oct. 11 policy meeting, according to 13 out of 16
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The bonds started the day weak on external events
including U.S. jobs data, but with market players looking
forward to a rate cut by the BOK this week, losses were
limited,” said Huh Kwan, a Seoul-based fixed-income trader at
Korea Investment & Securities Co.  The yield on the 2.75 percent notes due September 2017
climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to a one-week
high of 2.83 percent at the close in  Seoul , Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. The one-year  interest-rate  swap was little changed
at 2.81 percent.  The won slipped 0.1 percent to 1,112.05 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched
1,109.57 earlier, the strongest level since Nov. 1, 2011. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, rose 13 basis points to 6.15 percent.  South Korea ’s exports declined for a third month in
September and the government estimated that the U.S. accounted
for some 11 percent of shipments in the Sept. 1-Sept. 20 period.  The nation’s unemployment rate probably increased to 3.2
percent last month from 3.1 percent in July and August,
according to the median forecast of economists surveyed before
official data due Oct. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
