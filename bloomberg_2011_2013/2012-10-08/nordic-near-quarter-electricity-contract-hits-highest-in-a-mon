Nordic electricity for delivery in
November power rose to its highest in more than four weeks as
drier and cooler weather was forecast.  The contract rose as high as 40.50 euros ($52.54) a
megawatt-hour, up by 2.5 percent from the previous session and
the highest since Sept. 7, and later traded at 40.25 euros at
2:40 p.m. on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo.  The contract for January-March next year rose to its
highest since Sept. 10, adding as much as 2.4 percent from 43.00
euros a megawatt-hour before trading at 42.75 euros.  The hydrological balance, or the amount of water available
for generation compared with the seasonal mean, may drop by 50
percent to 6 terawatt-hours over the next two weeks, according
to Markedskraft AS data on Bloomberg.  Nordic power for delivery tomorrow changed hands at 33.51
euros in an auction on the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange in Oslo,
7.6 percent higher than the equivalent price yesterday. That’s
below the contract for Tuesday on the Nasdaq exchange which
traded at 34 euros.  The price for Finland hit 39.28 euros a megawatt-hour, the
highest in the Nordic region, as grid operator Fingrid Oyj cut
the capacity of a 550-megawatt power cable to  Sweden  to zero
until further notice because of a technical malfunction, it said
in a filing today to the Nord Pool Spot exchange.  The Nordic area gets about a fifth of its power from 14
nuclear reactors, and half by running water through turbines,
which means that prices are affected by rainfall and reactor
generating rates.  EON AG,  Germany ’s biggest utility, will “hopefully issue a
schedule” for the start of the 473-megawatt Oskarshamn-1
reactor in Sweden during the week, Anders Oesterberg, plant
communication manager, said today by phone from the unit on the
coast of the Baltic sea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
