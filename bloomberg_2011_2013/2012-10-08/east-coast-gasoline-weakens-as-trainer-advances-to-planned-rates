Gasoline weakened in New York Harbor
as  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) ’s Trainer refinery returned to service.  The Trainer plant, shut in September 2011 by  ConocoPhillips (COP) 
and purchased by Delta in April, is operating at planned rates,
said Trebor Banstetter, a company spokesman in Atlanta. The
185,000-barrel-a-day refinery unit accounts for 16 percent of
the East Coast’s capacity, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The  premium  for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline dropped 5
cents to 24 cents a barrel over futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 3:38 p.m. The gap has narrowed by 23.5
cents since Oct. 1. The prompt-delivery price slumped 10.94
cents to $3.1331 a gallon.  Inventories on the East Coast  fell 665,000 barrels to 46.1
million in the week ended Sept. 28, the Energy Department said.
That’s the lowest level in almost four years. U.S.  gasoline
demand  slid 1.5 percent to 8.68 million barrels a day in the
four weeks ended Sept. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
