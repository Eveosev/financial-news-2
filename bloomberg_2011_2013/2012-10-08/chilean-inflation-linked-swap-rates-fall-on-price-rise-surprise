Chilean inflation-linked swaps fell
to a month low after a report showed prices rose the most in
three years last month.  The one-year swap rate dropped 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 1.97 percent at 1:57 p.m. in Santiago. One-
year break-even inflation rose 11 basis points to a one-month
high of 2.94 percent. Five-year inflation-linked bond yields
slid six basis points to  2.25 percent  and the yield on 10-year
inflation-linked bonds was down one basis point to 2.35 percent.  Consumer prices  rose 0.8 percent in September from a month
earlier, the fastest since September 2009. The  median forecast 
of 11 economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a 0.6 percent
increase while traders in the forwards market had priced in a
0.59 percent advance. The National Statistics Institute
published the data Oct. 6.  “It’s positive news in a way: inflation 20 basis points
above expectations shows that the economy is still strong,”
said Jose Miguel Gredilla, a trader at Banco Santander Chile in
Santiago. “The swaps market is very driven by the U.S. and the
data from  Europe , with stocks falling and the euro weaker
offsetting the Chilean data.”  Traders in the forwards market for unidades de fomento,
 Chile ’s inflation-linked accounting unit, expect inflation of
1.95 percent in 2012, up from the 1.79 percent they were pricing
in on Oct. 5.  Chile’s peso fell to a two-week low as copper dropped after
the World Bank forecast slowing growth in East Asia, the
destination for most of Chile’s copper exports.  The currency declined 0.2 percent to 474.35. Earlier it
touched 475.55, the weakest on an intraday basis since Sept. 24.  Copper for December delivery fell 1.6 percent to $3.7255 a
pound on the Comex in New York. Chile is the biggest copper
producer in the world.  Chile posted its third straight  monthly trade deficit  in
September, the longest streak since 2008, according to central
bank data published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
