Sutton and East Surrey Water Services
Ltd. has been put up for sale by owner Icon Infrastructure, the
Sunday Times reported, saying Citigroup Inc. was appointed to
find a buyer of the water supplier.  The newspaper said a sale may get 250 million pounds ($400
million) to 300 million pounds for the privately owned U.K.
water utility that was acquired for 189 million pounds in 2005.
It supplies about 650,000 customers from East Surrey to parts of
West Sussex, west Kent and south  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
