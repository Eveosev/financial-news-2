Indonesian President  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  backed the government’s anti-corruption agency in a
dispute with the national police over which body should pursue a
graft case involving police procurement of driving simulators.  “The case should be handled by one institution alone and
that is the KPK,” Yudhoyono said, referring to the Corruption
Eradication Commission by its acronym at a briefing at the
Presidential Palace late yesterday after he met with leaders of
both agencies. Coordination between the police and KPK “isn’t
working well,” he said.  Dozens of police officers arrived at the KPK office Oct. 5
to question one of its investigators about an unrelated case
from 2004 on the same day the KPK questioned Djoko Susilo,
former chief of the national traffic police, about the driving
simulator case, state news agency Antara reported yesterday.
Novel Baswedan, a KPK investigator seconded from the police, led
the probe against Susilo, the report said.  The case highlights Yudhoyono’s difficulty in eradicating
corruption in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy, where legal
uncertainty threatens to hamper growth.  Indonesia  ranks 100 out
of 182 countries according to the Transparency International
corruption perception index.  “The police’s wish to legally process Novel Baswedan I
view as not proper be it the timing or its method,” Yudhoyono
said. “I reject any attempt to weaken KPK.”  Yudhoyono also said legislators’ plan to revise the anti-
graft law was untimely.  To contact the reporters on this story:
