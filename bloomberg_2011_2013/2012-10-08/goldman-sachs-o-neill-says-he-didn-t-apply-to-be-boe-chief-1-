Chairman Jim O’Neill said he did not apply to become the next
governor of the Bank of England.  “I have not applied,” O’Neill said in an e-mail today.
“I don’t think it was appropriate for me to apply. I have an
important job.”  Candidates to replace Mervyn King as chief of the U.K.
central bank have until 8.30 a.m. in  London  to express their
interest to the Treasury after it advertised the position in the
Economist magazine. King is scheduled to leave the bank in June
2013.  O’Neill took up his current position in 2010 after serving
as  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s (GS)  chief economist, during which time
he created the BRICs acronym to describe the growing power of
key  emerging markets  Brazil, Russia, India and China.  As of Sept. 11, bookmaker  Paddy Power Plc (PAP)  listed O’Neill as
fourth favorite to replace King with odds of 10/3, meaning a
successful 3-pound ($4.80) bet would win a 10-pound profit.  O’Neill told Bloomberg Television in June that he would
consider the Bank of England position “if I was approached.”  Goldman Sachs has historically been a breeding ground for
central bank chiefs. Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney,
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and Federal Reserve
Bank of  New York  President William Dudley worked there. Bank of
England policy maker Ben Broadbent was also employed by the
bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
