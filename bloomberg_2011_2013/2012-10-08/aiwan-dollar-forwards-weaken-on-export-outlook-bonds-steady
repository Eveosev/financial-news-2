Taiwan dollar forwards fell from a
three-week high on speculation the central bank will seek to
curb gains to support exports as demand from Europe and  China 
slows.  Government bonds  were steady before an auction.  The contracts pared a two-day gain before reports today
that may show Germany’s industrial production and overseas sales
fell in August. Manufacturing in China, the island’s biggest
export market, shrank for a second month in September, according
to figures released Oct. 1. Taiwan’s overseas sales rose 10.4
percent in September, data released at the close of trading
showed, after contracting in each of the previous six months.  “The appreciation we’ve been seeing in the past month is
due to foreign funds flowing in, but not because the economic
fundamentals have improved,” said Tarsicio Tong, a currency
trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. “The central bank
wouldn’t want the  Taiwan dollar  to be too strong” as the export
outlook remains weak, he said.  One-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.3 percent to
NT$29.28 per dollar in Taipei, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. In the  spot market , the local currency fell 0.1
percent to NT$29.402 after rising as much as 0.5 percent. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, rose two basis points to 3.81 percent.  Overseas investors bought $262 million more local shares
than they sold last week, bringing the tally to $3.03 billion
this year, exchange data show.  Trade Report  Government bonds fell after a finance ministry report today
showed exports rose 10.4 percent in September from a year
earlier, beating the median estimate for a 1 percent gain in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due July 2017 rose to
0.895 percent from 0.883 percent on Oct. 5, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The government sold NT$30 billion ($1
billion) of five-year bonds at an average yield of 0.881 percent
today versus 0.795 percent at a July 17 auction.  The  overnight money-market rate  was steady at 0.389
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center shows, unchanged from Oct. 5.  To contact the reporters on this story:
