Emerging European economies will grow
at a faster pace next year, driven by a recovery in the crisis-
hit euro area, the region’s main export market, the
 International Monetary Fund  said.  The region will grow 2.6 percent next year, compared with
an estimated 2 percent in 2012, “largely owing to improving
conditions elsewhere in  Europe ,” the Washington-based lender
said today in its World Economic Outlook.  The euro region is the top destination for emerging
Europe’s exports and the main source of its investment and bank
financing. Growth has slowed as the euro area’s economic slump
deepened and foreign lenders cut support to their units to
repair balance sheets. Still, emerging Europe is perceived as
less risky based on credit-default swaps than debt-ridden
nations using the euro, the IMF said.  “‘Emerging Europe was significantly affected by the euro-
area crisis during the past year, including through the
deleveraging of western European banks and declining capital
inflows,’’ the IMF said. ‘‘Nevertheless, unlike in 2008, risk
contagion from the euro-area crisis has remained limited, and
credit-default swap spreads for most countries in the region
remain well below those for the economies of the euro-area
periphery.’’  Polish CDS have declined 177 basis points to 103 basis
points this year and Hungarian swaps have dropped 289 basis
points to 346, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
privately negotiated markets.  Portugal ’s CDS have slid 640 basis
points to 442 during the same period. Spanish swaps are at 350,
compared with 380 at the end of 2011.  Slowing Inflation  Inflation pressure is set to decline ‘‘rapidly’’ in several
emerging European nations, giving central banks additional room
for easing monetary policy, the IMF said. Inflation will average
4.4 percent next year, down from 5.6 percent in 2012, the fund
forecast. It was 5.3 percent last year.  Turkey , where domestic demand is slowing following fiscal
policy tightening, will grow 3 percent in 2012 and 3.5 percent
next year, the fund said. Expansion in  Poland , the EU’s largest
eastern economy, will decelerate to 2.4 percent growth this
year, and 2.1 percent in 2013, from 4.3 percent in 2011, it
said.  Hungary’s economy will contract 1 percent this year,
recovering to 0.8 percent growth in 2013, while  Latvia ’s GDP
will grow at the fastest pace in the region this year, expanding
4.5 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
