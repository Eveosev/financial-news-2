 The  European Central Bank ’s
financing to Portuguese lenders rose in September from the
previous month, the Bank of  Portugal  said.  ECB lending increased to 55.59 billion euros ($71.9
billion) from 54.88 billion euros in August, the Lisbon-based
Bank of Portugal said today on the BPStat portion of its
website.  Portugal in April 2011 became the third euro-area country
to seek a bailout after Greece and Ireland, and will receive 78
billion euros under the agreement with the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Union. The aid plan earmarks as
much as 12 billion euros for the recapitalization of Portugal’s
lenders if needed.  The  Portuguese government  announced on June 4 that it has
committed to inject more than 6.6 billion euros into  Banco
Comercial Portugues SA (BCP) ,  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  and state-owned Caixa Geral
de Depositos SA.  Portuguese banks were required by the European Banking
Association to have a 9 percent Core Tier 1 ratio at the end of
June, after government bond holdings are written down to market
prices. They were also required to boost the ratio to 10 percent
by the end of 2012, according to Bank of Portugal rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
