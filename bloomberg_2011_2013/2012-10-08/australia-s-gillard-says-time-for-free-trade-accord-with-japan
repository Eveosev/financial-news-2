Australia and Japan need to overcome
hurdles and agree on a free-trade pact after five years of
talks, according to Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard .  “Japan is a critically important economic partner for
Australia and will remain so in the future,” Gillard said in e-
mailed notes prepared ahead of a speech scheduled for tonight in
Sydney. “In a dynamic and changing region, it’s time to take
the next step. It’s time to seal the deal on a free-trade
agreement,” she said.  Australia’s two-way commerce with  Japan , the country’s
second-largest trading partner, totaled A$66.1 billion ($67.2
billion) in 2010, according to the Department of  Foreign Affairs 
and Trade. Negotiations on a free-trade agreement with Japan
started in April 2007 and “only a few hurdles remain,” Gillard
said, without specifying what they are.  Commodities, including iron ore and coal, made up 47.5
percent of Australia’s total exports in 2010, according to the
government department.  China  was Australia’s largest trading
partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
