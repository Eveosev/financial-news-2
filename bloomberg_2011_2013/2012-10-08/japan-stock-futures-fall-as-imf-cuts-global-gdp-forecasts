Japanese  stock   futures  fell after the
 International Monetary Fund  cut its global growth forecasts as
its member countries convene in  Tokyo  this week, damping demand
for risky assets. Australian equities rose.  American depositary receipts of trading firm  Mitsubishi
Corp. (8058)  dropped 1.3 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo.
Oil Search Ltd., Papua New Guinea’s biggest oil producer,
climbed 2.7 percent in early Sydney trading after signing
exploration license agreements with Total SA affiliates. Shares
of Daiichi Chuo Kisen Kaisha may be active after it said it may
cancel ship orders, pare its fleet and sell new stock.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
December closed at 8,800 in Chicago yesterday, down from 8,870
in Osaka,  Japan , on Oct. 5. Japan’s markets were closed
yesterday for a public holiday. They were bid in the pre-market
at 8,810 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index gained 0.2 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slipped
0.1 percent in Wellington.  “Asia is of course a world major trader and major
exporter, and it’s suffering from not only a slowdown in China,
but also across all of  Europe ,” said Matthew Sherwood,
Perpetual Investments’ head of investment markets research in
Sydney. Perpetual manages about $25 billion. “We are looking at
balance-sheet risks in each individual company because we are in
a capital-constrained world. Therefore, companies that can fund
their own balance sheets are in a very strong relative
position.”  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 7.3 percent this year
through yesterday as a wave of stimulus measure from Europe to
the U.S. and Japan countered a global economic slowdown,
hindered by Europe’s debt crisis. The Asian benchmark trades at
12.8 times estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.9
times for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 12.1 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The world economy will expand 3.3 percent this year, the
slowest pace since the 2009 recession, and 3.6 percent next
year, the IMF said today. That compares with July predictions of
3.5 percent in 2012 and 3.9 percent in 2013. The Washington-
based lender now sees “alarmingly high” risks of a steeper
slowdown.  The IMF’s 188 member countries meet in Tokyo this week.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index dropped 0.4 percent in New York
yesterday, when European finance ministers met in Luxembourg to
discuss Spain’s overhaul effort and closer banking cooperation.
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  is scheduled to visit Greece
today.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. retreated 1.1 percent to 92.13
yesterday in New York, the steepest drop since Sept. 20.  Energy shares may be active after crude oil for November
delivery declined 55 cents to settle at $89.33 a barrel on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange .  Japan’s current account surplus probably shrank in August,
