BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , France’s largest
bank, said it has signed up 3,560 corporate clients in the past
22 months for a pan-European banking offer.  The increase is above the 3,000 target the bank set for
itself when it began “One Bank for Corporates in  Europe ” at
the start of 2011, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, chief operating
officer, told reporters in Paris today. The product provides
uniform banking services for companies in 24 countries.  The average new client has revenue of between 300 million
euros and 400 million euros ($520 million) a year, he said. He
said he couldn’t provide figures on how many additional deposits
the clients have brought in.  To contact the reporters on this story:
