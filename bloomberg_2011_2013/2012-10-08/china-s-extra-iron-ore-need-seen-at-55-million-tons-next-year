China’s additional iron-ore
requirements in 2013 may total between 45 million and 55 million
metric tons, according to Paul Gray, principal iron-ore market
analyst with Wood Mackenzie Ltd.  About 25 million tons will be needed to meet increased
crude-steel production, Gray said today at the  7th EU Iron Ore
Conference  in Vienna. Steel-mill restocking will account for the
remainder, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
