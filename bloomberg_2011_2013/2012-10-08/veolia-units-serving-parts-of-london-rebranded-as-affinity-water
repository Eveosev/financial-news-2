Three Veolia water units serving
parts of northwest London and the Home counties that were
acquired last June have been renamed Affinity Water.  Veolia Water Central, Veolia Water Southeast and Veolia
Water East, former U.K. units of the French water utility  Veolia
Environnement SA (VIE) , were brought together under one name effective
this month after being purchased for 1.2 billion pounds ($1.9
billion), Affinity Water said.  The buyer of Paris-based Veoliaâ€™s U.K. unit was Rift
Acquisitions Ltd., formed by Infracapital Partners, an
infrastructure investment fund managed by M&G, the European
investment arm of  Prudential Plc (PRU) , and  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
Infrastructure Partners. Veolia, which has been disposing of
assets to reduce debt, will keep 10 percent of the business for
at least five years under the deal.  Affinity Water provides water supplies to about 3.3 million
people in parts of Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire,
Essex, Hertfordshire, Surrey, the London boroughs of Harrow and
Hillingdon; parts of the London boroughs of Barnet, Brent,
Ealing and Enfield; the Tendring peninsular in Essex; as well as
the Folkestone and Dover areas of Kent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
