Nigeria’s naira gained against the
dollar on the  interbank market  on bets that the inclusion of the
nation’s bonds into JPMorgan Chase & Co. index series will spur
foreign currency inflows.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer rose 0.1
percent to 157.1375 a dollar at 4:47 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira has advanced 3.3 percent this
year, the best performer in Africa, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The most-traded bonds maturing in March 2014, October 2019
and January 2022 will join JPMorgan’s GBI-EM indexes between
Oct. 1 and Dec. 3, Giulia Pellegrini, the bank’s London-based
sub-Saharan Africa economist, wrote in a note to clients Sept.
25.  JPMorgan first disclosed the plans in August after central
bank Governor Lamido Sanusi’s decision last year to attract more
funds by removing restrictions on foreign investors holding the
West African country’s debt.  Nigeria ’s inclusion “has enhanced offshore participation
in local debt markets, enlarging the pool of U.S. dollars to
local players,” Celeste Fauconnier and Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana,
Africa strategists at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, wrote
in a report today. The naira is “likely to remain suspended
below 158 over the next few days.”  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $104.9 million at its
first of two regular twice-a-week foreign-currency auctions,
with lenders buying less than the $150 million on offer, the
Abuja-based regulator said in a statement on its website. The
marginal rate was 155.75 naira, compared with 155.77 naira at
the previous Oct. 3 sale.  The yield on Nigeria’s 10.5 percent domestic bonds due
March 2014 declined six basis points to 11.62 percent, according
to Oct. 5 data on the Financial Markets Dealers Association
website. Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 fell three basis points to 4.77 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi rose 0.2 percent to 1.8905 a dollar in Accra,
the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
