The managing director of  Absa Group
Ltd. (ASA) ’s Tanzanian unit returned to work two months after he was
asked to step aside during a probe into “irregular governance
practices, fraud and corruption,” the bank said.  Lawrence Mafuru, managing director of Absa-controlled
National Bank of Commerce Ltd, was sent on leave on July 20
after a whistle-blower complained.  “The board has resolved appropriately all the matters
arising out of the investigation, and that Mafuru will be
returning to work immediately” National Bank said in a
statement handed to reporters today in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania’s
commercial capital. Mafuru said the process was “necessary,”
according to the statement.  Absa, the South African bank that’s controlled by Barclays
Plc, owns 55 percent of National Bank of Commerce. Absa has been
scrutinized by investors and analysts since saying on June 26
that profit may fall as much as 10 percent after it failed to
set aside enough money for bad debts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
