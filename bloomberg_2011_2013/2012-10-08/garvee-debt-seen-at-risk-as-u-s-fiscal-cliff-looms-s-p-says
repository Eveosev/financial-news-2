Two out of every five municipal bonds
backed by federal fuel taxes have a negative outlook due to
risks from the  U.S. budget deficit ,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles, known as Garvees,
are sold by states or transit agencies and backed by federal
highway or transit aid. Moody’s Investors Service last month
placed 28 Garvee ratings on review for downgrade.  Fitch Ratings 
cut the level of 11 Garvees on Sept. 12.  “This sector continues to face economic and financial
risks associated with the pace of the U.S. economic recovery,
and with the consequences of federal deficits and budget
impasses,” Peter Murphy, an analyst at S&P, said in the report.  Congress passed an act in June that extends an 18.4-cents-
per-gallon federal gasoline tax, the main revenue source for the
Highway Trust Fund, which finances Garvees.  The 27-month extension will provide $120 billion for
highway and transit programs, according to S&P. Funds will also
include about $19 billion from the general treasury. The
legislation was the first long-term policy bill Congress has
passed for highways and transit since 2009.  A so-called fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts
is set to take effect at the beginning of next year if Congress
doesn’t break a partisan deadlock and reach agreement on the
nation’s budget deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
