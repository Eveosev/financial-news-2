A C$28 million ($29 million)
wastewater treatment plant has opened in Mississippi Mills
southwest of Ottawa that was equally funded by federal,
provincial and town authorities.  The commissioning of the extended aeration wastewater
facility in eastern Ontario adjacent to the site of existing
sewage lagoons with effluent released to the river that meets
provincial requirements comes after two years of construction by
North American Construction Ltd. and 10 years of planning,
Mississippi Millsâ€™s public works department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
