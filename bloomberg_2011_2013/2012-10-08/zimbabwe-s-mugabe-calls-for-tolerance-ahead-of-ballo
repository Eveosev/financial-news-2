Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
called for tolerance as the southern African nation heads for
elections expected next year.  “Let people vote how they want to vote, and those who
don’t want to vote can throw their vote into the sea, it’s their
choice,” Mugabe, 88, said today in Harare, the capital, at the
funeral of Stanislaus “Stan” Mudenge, minister for higher
education and a veteran member of the ruling  Zimbabwe  African
National Union-Patriotic Front.  Mugabe said Sept. 27 that he would probably call for a
nationwide ballot to be held in March. His party’s coalition
partner, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai’s Movement for
Democratic Change, has said the president can’t call elections
without the MDC’s approval. The two parties have ruled in a
“unity” government since 2009 under an agreement brokered by
the Southern African Development Community after a vote the
previous year was marred by widepread violence.  Under the SADC accord, Zimbabwe must hold a national
referendum to approve a new constitution before fresh elections
can be held. ZANU-PF and two factions of the MDC have failed to
agree on a draft constitution.  “Let us treat each other equally and recognize that
although we may differ, we are also the same,” Mugabe said. “I
am Zanu-PF, Tsvangirai is MDC. These are preferences.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
