Kuwait Petroleum Corp. will sell a
year’s supply of full-range naphtha starting in December at a
premium of $27 a metric ton, according to two people with
knowledge of negotiations with Asian buyers.  The company set its premium to Middle East benchmark prices
during talks in  London  last week, the people said, asking not to
be identified because the information is confidential. No one
answered two telephone calls to the media relations department
in Kuwait City.  The premium is 13 percent higher than the $24 a ton buyers
paid for a year’s supply beginning in August 2012, the people
said. Kuwait sold naphtha at a premium of $18.50 a ton for the
contract starting December 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
