Venture-capital funding for the
solar-power industry fell 81 percent to $72 million in the third
quarter, the lowest since 2008, according to a report by Mercom
Capital Group LLC.  This was the first sub-$100 million quarter in five years,
the Austin, Texas-based clean-energy consulting firm said today
in a  statement .  Falling solar panel prices aren’t good for the companies
that make them, the upstream manufacturers, said Raj Prabhu,
managing partner at Mercom, while low prices have been “really
good for those downstream” that buy them, like SolarCity Inc.,
which on Friday filed plans to raise more than $200 million in
an initial public offering.  Companies that install solar systems raised about $1
billion in leasing funds in the quarter, mainly from banks, said
Prabhu. “Downstream is doing much better than technology
companies because they don’t require as much capital.”  Acquisitions of solar manufacturers MiaSole Inc. and Q-
Cells SE in the quarter raised much less than venture backers
had hoped, according to Prabhu.  “When you look at it, they were fire sales or distress
sales,” he said. “If these are the types of exits, then it’s
pretty tough out there.”  The largest venture-capital transaction was concentrating
photovoltaic-systems maker SolFocus Inc.’s $15 million funding,
according to the report. Only one venture capital company,  New
Enterprise Associates , was involved in more than one deal,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
