Norway’s $650 billion sovereign
wealth fund bought a 50 percent stake in the Meadowhall Shopping
Centre in northern  England  for 348 million pounds ($560
million), its second U.K. acquisition.  The fund purchased the stake from  London & Stamford
Property Plc (LSP)  and Green Park Investments, Norges Bank Investment
Management said in a statement today. The transaction values the
mall at 1.53 billion pounds including debt, according to the
bank, which manages the Norwegian fund. The net yield is 5.09
percent at that price.  “The purchase gives us exposure to one of the largest and
most dominant shopping centers in the U.K.,” Karsten Kallevig,
chief investment officer of Norges’ real estate division, said
in the statement.  The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund’s first U.K. deal was
the 448 million-pound purchase of a 25 percent stake in London’s
Regent Street in November 2010. During the past two years, the
fund has also acquired properties in Paris in partnerships with
the real estate asset management arms of  Axa SA (CS)  and Generali
Assuricazioni SpA.  The Norwegian fund, which gets its revenue from taxes on
oil and gas, ownership of petroleum fields and dividends from a
67 percent stake in Statoil ASA, got the go-ahead from the
 finance ministry  to start investing in real estate in 2010.  U.S. Plans  The fund plans to make its first real estate investments in
the U.S. by the end of next year, Trond Grande, deputy chief
executive officer at Norges Bank Investment Management, said in
an interview last month.  British Land Plc (BLND) , the U.K. real estate investment trust
that owns the other 50 percent of Meadowhall, will manage the
mall for the Norwegian fund, according to the statement.
Meadowhall has about 25 million visitors each year and has
141,000 square meters (1.52 million square feet) of retail space
that can be leased to tenants.  London  &  Stamford  and Green Park Investments acquired the
50 percent stake in the mall in February 2009 for 170 million
pounds and 418 million pounds in assumed debt. London &
Stamford’s smaller share in the venture with Green Park meant
that its stake in the Meadowhall was 16 percent.  The sale means it generated a 32 percent annual return on
its 48 million-pound cash investment, said Keith Crawford, an
analyst at London-based broker Peel Hunt LLP. Crawford
reiterated his buy rating on London & Stamford’s shares.  London & Stamford declined 0.6 pence to 115.40 pence at
10:06 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
