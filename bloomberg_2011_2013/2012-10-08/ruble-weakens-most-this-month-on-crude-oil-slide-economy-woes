The ruble fell the most this month,
as oil,  Russia ’s main export earner, dropped amid speculation an
economic slowdown in Asia will curb fuel demand.  The ruble declined 0.9 percent percent to 31.1600 against
the dollar by 7 p.m. in Moscow, the most since Sept. 26. The
Russian currency slipped 0.4 percent versus the euro to 40.4200
and retreated 0.7 percent against the central bank’s target
euro-dollar basket.  Crude oil in New York sank as much as 1.9 percent before
trading down 0.3 percent at $89.64 per barrel. Economic growth
in developing East Asia, including  China , will be the slowest
since 2001, according to the World Bank. Russia’s central bank
kept its key interest rates on hold last week.  “The falling oil price along with disappointment from some
investors over Russia’s central bank leaving key rates unchanged
prevented the ruble from further appreciation,” Sergey Fishgoyt, deputy head of foreign exchange at Otkritie Financial
Corp. in Moscow, said by phone today.  The ruble rose at the end of last week after the European
Central Bank reiterated its pledge to buy government bonds and
help ease borrowing costs in the region.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.6143 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.3597 on Oct. 5.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell one basis point to 186,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields fell nine basis points to
7.416 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
