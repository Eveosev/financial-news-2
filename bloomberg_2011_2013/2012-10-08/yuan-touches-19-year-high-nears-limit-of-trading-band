The  yuan  touched its highest level
since 1993, nearing the strong end of the central bank’s trading
range, on speculation Chinese policy makers will take more steps
to counter a slowdown.  Financial markets opened today after a weeklong holiday,
during which the Chinese Communist Party said its 18th congress
will start Nov. 8. The event, to feature a once-a-decade
handover of power to a new generation of leaders, may result in
increased stimulus to counter an economic slowdown, according to
research notes last week from Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. and
Australian & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. The U.S. jobless
rate dropped to 7.8 percent in September, the lowest level since
January 2009, data released on Oct. 5 showed.  “The Congress date signals that political issues have been
set aside and the leaders will focus on reviving the economy,”
said  Daniel Chan , executive vice president at Glory Sky Global
Markets Ltd. in Hong Kong. “The U.S. data are encouraging for
Chinese exports, which also supports the yuan.”  The yuan climbed to 6.2812 per dollar, the strongest level
since  China  unified official and market exchange rates at the
end of 1993, before ending the trading day 0.04 percent weaker
at 6.2872, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
Today’s high exceeded the central bank’s reference rate by a
record 0.98 percent, near to the maximum 1 percent divergence
that is permitted.  The People’s Bank of China lowered its daily fixing by 0.03
percent today to 6.3426 per dollar. That was 0.9 percent weaker
than the closing spot price on Sept. 28.  Forwards Steady  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed
at 6.3913 per dollar by 11:02 a.m. in  New York . One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was steady at 1.2 percent.  China’s yuan positions may have fallen in September as the
nation faces “more severe” imported inflationary pressure
after  Europe , U.S. and  Japan  expanded quantitative easing, the
People’s Bank of China’s publication Financial News said in a
front-page commentary today.  China’s service industries expanded at a faster pace in
September. The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose to 54.3 from 52
in August, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said today. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  “This suggests that Chinese growth will rebound only
modestly towards year-end,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong
Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “Nevertheless,
today’s data is a positive as it puts a floor under the overall
sentiment measure.”  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.05
percent to 6.2945 per dollar.  Manufacturing in China shrank in August and September,
contracting in consecutive months for the first time since 2009,
according to a government-backed Purchasing Managers’ Index
published Oct. 1. The gauge was 49.8 in September, compared with
49.2 in the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
