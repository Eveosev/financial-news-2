Korea  National Oil Corp. purchased
100,000 barrels of gasoline in an auction for the first time
since it was commissioned by the government to take part in the
country’s retail market for oil products.  The fuel is scheduled to be delivered to Ulsan, a port on
the southern tip of the Korean peninsula, in the fourth week of
this month, said Kelvin Han, a spokesman at the Anyang, South
Korea-based company, by phone today.  The purchase is part of the government’s plan to supply
200,000 barrels of oil products by the end of this year to
independent gas stations that aren’t associated with Korea’s
four oil refiners, he said, giving no details on suppliers and
other terms.  The state company will hold another auction to buy the
remaining 100,000 barrels of oil products once it sells out of
this volume, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
