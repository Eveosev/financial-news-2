Denmark’s Climate and Energy Minister
Martin Lidegaard hopes the European Union will agree “within
months” on how to improve the bloc’s emissions trading system
before 2020.  “We need a decision to make a more sustainable price in
the ETS,” Lidegaard said in an interview in Copenhagen. “I
hope for a decision on the framework for ETS by 2020 within
months.”  EU member states are considering a plan by the European
Commission, the bloc’s regulator, to delay auctions of some
carbon permits as of 2013 to curb an oversupply of allowances
and help prices rebound from record lows earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
