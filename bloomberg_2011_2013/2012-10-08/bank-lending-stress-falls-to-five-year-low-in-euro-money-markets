Money-market indicators show stress
in short-term unsecured lending between banks declined to the
lowest since 2007.  The difference between the euro interbank offered rate and
overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-OIS spread, was 12.4
basis points, or 0.124 percentage point, at 10:31 a.m. in  London 
from 13 on Oct. 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure is the tightest since Aug. 8, 2007.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they see each other
lending at in euros, was set at a record low 0.214 percent from
0.215 percent on Oct. 5. The benchmark is derived from a daily
survey of banks for the European Banking Federation.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars rose from
the lowest in more than a week. The three-month cross-currency
 basis swap  was 24 basis points below Euribor, from minus 22 on
Oct. 5. The one-year basis swap was 25 basis points below
Euribor from minus 24.  The European Banking Federationâ€™s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.093
percent on Oct. 5 from 0.095 percent the day before. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, was unchanged at 8.5 basis points.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the  European
Central Bank  on Oct. 5, placing 296 billion euros ($384 billion)
with the Frankfurt-based central bank from 278 billion euros the
day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
