CareFusion Corp. (CFN) , a U.S. maker of
medical technology that helps people breathe, agreed to buy
closely held Brazilian respiratory device company Intermed
Equipamento Medico Hospitalar Ltda.  Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed today in a joint
statement announcing it.  U.S. health-care companies have been buying assets in
Brazil to take advantage of the country’s growing economy and
market for drugs, medical services and equipment.  UnitedHealth
Group Inc. (UNH)  also announced today it would spend $4.9 billion to
buy 90 percent of  Amil Participacoes SA (AMIL3) , a Brazil-based insurer
and hospitals operator that gives the American company a stake
in the world’s second-biggest emerging economy.  “Intermed brings a strong distributor network, local
manufacturing capabilities and a new product portfolio that we
believe can serve as a base for CareFusion to continue our
global expansion efforts in Latin America,” CareFusion Chief
Executive Officer Kieran Gallahue said in the statement
announcing the deal.  The purchase is expected to close by the end of the year,
will add about $25 million to San Diego-based CareFusion’s
yearly annual sales and be “modestly dilutive” to fiscal 2013
 earnings , the company said in the statement. Intermed is based
in Sao Paolo.  CareFusion  shares  rose less than 1 percent to $28.62 at the
close in New York.  Brazil ’s private health-care market is expanding faster
than any other country’s except the U.S., the two insurers said
in a joint release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
