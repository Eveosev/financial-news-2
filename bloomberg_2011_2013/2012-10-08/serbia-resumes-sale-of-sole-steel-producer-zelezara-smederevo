Serbia invited bids for  Zelezara
Smederevo d.o.o. , its only steel plant, renewing its attempts to
sell the unprofitable mill nine months after the  U.S. Steel
Corp. (X)  sold it back to the state for $1.  Bidders from mining, iron and steel industries have until
Oct. 26 to submit offers, including a business plan to restart
Zelezaraâ€™s two idled furnaces and a four-year investment plan of
at least $50 million, according to the details of the sale
published in Belgrade newspaper Politika today.  Investors seeking to buy the plant need to have assets of
at least $2.5 billion and annual revenue of $2 billion in 2011,
the Finance Ministry said.  The government is close to agreeing the sale to a Russian
investor, Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic  said on Sept. 26, without
naming the company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
