London Mayor  Boris Johnson  asked
Barclays Bank Plc to double its sponsorship of the U.K.
capital’s  bike hire program  to 50 million pounds ($81 million)
in recognition of the support British tax payers give to the
financial sector.  The bank, which put 25 million pounds into the 140 million-
pound project, should show it wants to put something back into
the community, Johnson said. Cyclists rent bikes from stations
around London and drop them off at the end of their journey.  “It’s good that Barclays coughed up 25 million for the
bike hire scheme and I think they could cough up another 25
million,” Johnson said in a BBC TV interview. “And they should
because these people have received substantial sums of money
from the tax payer to keep the whole banking industry afloat.”  While recognizing that the financial sector generates
“hundreds of thousands of jobs” and 31 billion pounds in tax,
Johnson said he wants to see more of the money being paid in
bonuses shared with other Londoners, both through donations from
highly paid employees and corporate sponsorship.  “I would like to see a greater share of their earnings
going to the city that surrounds them, we’re starting to see
some progress and people giving more,” Johnson said. “It’s a
long day’s march saying that and then saying the best thing for  London  would be to machine gun the bankers or deport them. That,
I’m afraid, is not a credible economic policy for this city.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
