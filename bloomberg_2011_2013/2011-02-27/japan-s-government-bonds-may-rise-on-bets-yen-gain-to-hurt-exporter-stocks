Japan’s bonds fell for a second day
as domestic shares reversed an early decline, damping demand for
the relative safety of government debt.  Ten-year yields increased from near a three-week low on
speculation investors will reduce debt holdings to secure a
higher coupon for tomorrow’s 10-year auction. Japan-based Rating
& Investment said today political conflict is putting downward
pressure on the nation’s  credit rating .  “In addition to the rebound in Japanese stocks, bonds were
sold as investors became increasingly cautious about tomorrow’s
10-year auction,” said Kazuya Ito, a  fund manager  at Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd. in Tokyo, which manages the equivalent of $55
billion.  The benchmark 10-year yield gained one basis point to 1.250
percent as of 3:28 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The yield has advanced
3.5 basis points this month. The 1.2 percent security maturing
in December 2020 fell 0.087 yen to 99.563 yen. Ten-year yields
touched 1.22 percent on Feb. 24, the lowest since Feb. 2. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery slid 0.05 to
139.54 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average advanced 0.9 percent after earlier
dropping as much as 0.7 percent.  Japan’s  Finance Ministry  will sell 2.2 trillion yen ($26.9
billion) of 10-year bonds tomorrow. The prior sale on Feb. 1
drew bids worth 2.69 times the amount on offer, compared with a
so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 2.99 at the January auction. The
coupon was set at 1.2 percent.  Primary dealers, which are required to bid at government
debt sales, often reduce holdings of bonds before an auction in
case prices decline before they can pass on the new securities
to investors.  10-Year Coupon  The coupon set at the 10-year auction “is likely to be 1.3
percent," said  Keiko Onogi , fixed-income strategist at Daiwa
Securities SMBC Co. in Tokyo.  Conflict within the ruling  Democratic Party  of Japan and
potential difficulty passing the nation’s budget may weigh on
its credit rating, Rating & Investment said in a report. The
Japanese rating company rates Japan AAA with a‘‘negative’’
outlook.  Bonds gained earlier after government data on industrial
production added to concern the nation’s economic recovery is
losing momentum. Factory output climbed 2.4 percent in January,
compared with the median economist estimate of 4 percent in a
Bloomberg survey.  ‘‘Recent economic data make me think that the economic
recovery will be rather weak and slow,’’ said Shinji Hiramatsu,
senior investment manager in Tokyo at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa
Asset Management Co. Ltd., which oversees about $18 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
