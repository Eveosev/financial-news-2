Labor Unions representing employees
of Aeropuertos Espanoles y Navegacion Aerea SA,  Spain ’s airport
operator, are threatening to strike in April over Easter and
this summer if the government doesn’t scrap plans to partially
privatize the company,  El Pais  reported.  Excluding air traffic controllers, Aena employs 12,500
workers in airports all over Spain who may strike if the
government sells 49 percent of the company, the newspaper said,
citing unidentified union members.  To contact the reporters on this story:
