  Christian Dior SA  fashion designer  John Galliano  will meet the woman accusing him of anti-Semitism
tomorrow in a confrontation called by Paris prosecutors to
settle the matter four days after he was arrested, his lawyer
said.  The woman claimed a drunken Galliano verbally attacked her
and her companion at a Paris cafe, using anti-Semitic and racist
phrases. Dior, where Galliano is head designer, suspended him
pending a police investigation into the incident.  Galliano filed counterclaims against the woman, accusing
her of “defamation, intimidation and slander,” Stephane
Zerbib, his lawyer, said in an interview today. “It was he who
was assaulted first, he responded but he was never violent and
never uttered anti-semitic statements.”  Dior’s suspension of its head designer came one week before
the scheduled presentation of Galliano’s collection for Dior
Couture at  Paris Fashion Week  at the  Rodin museum . Gibraltar-
born Galliano, 50, is renowned for staging spectacular fashion
shows and is scheduled to show his own label on March 6. Zerbib
had no information on how the affair would affect the two
events.  “It’s been more than 12 years that he’s worked at Dior and
he has never had a racism or anti-Semitism problem,” Zerbib
said. “Galliano did nothing, he is serene, he wants his honor
restored.”  Galliano had “drunk a bit of alcohol,” Zerbib said, while
saying that was “not a problem.” Galliano’s version of the
events is backed up by other witnesses at the cafe in Paris’s
fashionable third arrondissement, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
