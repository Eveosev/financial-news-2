Lyttelton Port of Christchurch,  New
Zealand ’s largest coal-exporting hub, resumed core services
after last week’s earthquake.  “The port’s core services are operational,” the company
said in a  statement  on its website.  The port was closed and infrastructure damaged in the 6.3-
magnitude earthquake that struck Christchurch Feb. 22, killing
more than 140 people. The death toll is likely to increase, with
50 still unaccounted for, according to  police .  One ship has berthed for fuel exchange and three more are
scheduled to arrive at the oil berth in the next three days, the
port said. Structural checks will be carried out on the port’s
dry dock this week, it said.  Lyttelton Port unloaded one ship carrying 300 containers
this morning and is expecting two more vessels today, the
 company  said. The nearby Lyttelton road tunnel has been reopened
for residents and emergency and essential services, including
container transport, it said.  To contact the reporter for this story: Phoebe Sedgman in
