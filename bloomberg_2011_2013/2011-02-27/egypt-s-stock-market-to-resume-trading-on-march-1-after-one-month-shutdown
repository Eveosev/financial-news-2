  Egypt ’s stock market will resume
trading on March 1 after a suspension of more than a month amid
a popular revolt that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak ’s 30-year
regime.  Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik replaced the head of the
Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority and approved changes to
trading rules aimed at limiting possible losses when the market
reopens, the North African country’s Cabinet said in a statement
today. Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index  of stocks slumped 16
percent in the week that ended Jan. 27, the day it last opened.  “They’re trying to limit the drop as much as possible,”
said Mohamed Radwan, head of international sales at Cairo-based
Pharos Holding for Financial Investment. “Investors were
frustrated with the market closure so the resumption is
essential. There shouldn’t be a fear of the market taking a hit
because those buying at a discount will boost the market in the
long term.”  Efsa’s former head, Ziad Bahaa El-Din, is the latest
official to be replaced after Shafik brought in 11 new ministers
last week to appease protesters. The regulator announced a list
of rules on Feb. 19 aimed at managing a possible selloff when
trading resumes, including putting in place a 10 percent circuit
breaker on the daily price movement of shares, reducing trading
hours by one to three, and banning  margin trading .  To contact the reporters on this story:
