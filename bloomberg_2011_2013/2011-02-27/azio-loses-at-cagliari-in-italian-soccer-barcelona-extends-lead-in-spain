Goals from  Wesley Sneijder  and
Samuel Eto’o lifted Inter Milan to a 2-0 win at Sampdoria and
into second place in Italian soccer’s Serie A.  Sneijder opened the scoring with a 73rd-minute free kick in
Genoa last night before Eto’o added the second in stoppage time
to take defending champion Inter within two points of league
leader AC Milan, which hosts third-place Napoli today.  AC Milan has 55 points, Inter 53 and Napoli 52. Lazio
stayed fourth with 48 points when it lost 1-0 at Cagliari
yesterday on Andre Dias’s own goal. Fifth-place Udinese routed
nine-man Palermo 7-0 as Armin Bacinovic and Matteo Damian were
red-carded.  In  Spain , Valencia boosted its Champions League
qualification chances with a 2-1 win at  Athletic Bilbao  last
night. Juan Mata and Jonas Goncalves got the goals as third-
place Valencia opened a four-point gap to Villarreal in fourth.  Barcelona stretched its lead over Real Madrid atop the
standings to seven points with a 3-0 win at Real Mallorca two
days ago. Real drew 0-0 at Deportivo La Coruna.    Borussia Dortmund  heads Germany’s Bundesliga by 12 points
after a 3-1 victory at  Bayern Munich  two days ago. Second-place
Bayer Leverkusen drew 2-2 at Werder Bremen yesterday.  In  France , Lille leads Rennes by goal difference at the top
after drawing 1-1 with Lyon last night. Both teams have 46
points through 25 games. Four points separate the top five.  In the  Netherlands , PSV stretched its lead to three points
after a 0-0 draw with Ajax yesterday. PSV has 54 points, while
FC Twente stays on 51 after a 2-1 loss at AZ Alkmaar.  WEEKEND RESULTS
