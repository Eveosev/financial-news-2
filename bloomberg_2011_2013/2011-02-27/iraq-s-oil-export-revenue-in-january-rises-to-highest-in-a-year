Revenue from Iraqi crude oil exports
rose to $6.08 billion in January, the most in more than a year,
the country’s  State Oil Marketing Organization  said.  The average price for Iraqi oil was $90.78 a barrel,
compared with $86.31 in December and $80.59 in November, SOMO
said in a statement on its website today.  Exports increased last month by about 10 percent to 67
million barrels, or about 2.16 million barrels a day, compared
with 60.5 million barrels, or 1.95 million barrels a day, in
December, it said.  Revenue from the southern oil center of Basra climbed to
$4.88 billion, the highest since 2003, on January exports of 54
million barrels. Sales from the northern oil hub of Kirkuk,
where pipelines and oil facilities are often the target of
insurgent attacks, rose slightly to $1.2 million on shipments of
13 million, SOMO said.    Iraq , which generates most of its revenue from oil sales,
is seeking foreign investors to help boost crude production,
which has suffered from militant attacks and a lack of
investment. The government has awarded 15 development contracts
to international energy companies since the U.S.-led invasion
that ousted the regime of  Saddam Hussein  in 2003.  Iraq, with the world’s fifth-largest oil reserves, expects
crude output to rise to more than 3 million barrels a day by the
end of this year, compared with 2.4 million barrels in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
