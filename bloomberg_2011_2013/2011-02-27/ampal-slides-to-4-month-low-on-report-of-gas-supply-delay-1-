  Ampal-American Israel  Corp., the
owner of a 12.5 percent stake in the Egyptian gas supplier East
Mediterranean Gas Co., fell to the lowest level in more than
four months as TheMarker reported gas flow will be delayed.  Ampal dropped 7.1 percent to 6.568 shekels, the lowest
since Oct. 7 at the close in  Tel Aviv .  Gas flow will be delayed for a few days, the business daily
reported today, citing an Israeli government evaluation. The
holding company that imports the fuel earlier said it expected
deliveries to resume by the end of February.  Recent political unrest in  Egypt  sparked concern Ampal
would have trouble meeting contractual obligations to Israeli
consumers. Egyptian natural gas exports to Israel and Jordan
were halted on Feb. 5 after an explosion damaged a pipeline in
the Sinai Desert.  Israeli gas explorers with interests in the countryâ€™s Yam
Tethys project and Tamar field advanced.  Isramco Negev 2 LP rose 2.5 percent to 0.415 shekel, Avner
Oil Exploration-LP gained 0.7 percent to 2.337 shekels and  Delek
Group Ltd . increased 1.1 percent to 872.30 shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
