Electricite de France SA may refuse
to approve  Edison SpA (EDN) ’s financial results at a board meeting on
March 14 to force a showdown over control of the Italian
electric utility,  Corriere della Sera  reported, citing no one.  Such a move would trigger rules in an agreement between
EDF, A2A and other Italian shareholders that would force them to
resolve their dispute over control of the power company within
20 days, the newspaper said.  EDF controls about 50 percent of Edison and has been
pushing for more management control over the power company. A2A,  Italy ’s largest municipal utility, owns 51 percent of holding
company Delmi SpA, which jointly owns Transalpina di Energia Srl
with EDF. Transalpina has 61.2 percent of Edison.  The companies control Edison through an accord that expires
in September and must be renewed six months in advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Andrew Davis  in Rome at
