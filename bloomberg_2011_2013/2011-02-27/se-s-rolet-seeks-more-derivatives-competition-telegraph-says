  London Stock Exchange Group Plc  will
ask European regulators to increase competition in the
derivatives market when they consider the planned merger of
Deutsche Boerse AG and  NYSE Euronext , the Sunday Telegraph said.  The newspaper cited an interview with Chief Executive
Officer Xavier Rolet. The proposed merger would create a “huge
monopoly” in Europe, with the combined group controlling 90
percent of interest rate derivatives and 90 percent of equity
derivatives, Rolet said, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
