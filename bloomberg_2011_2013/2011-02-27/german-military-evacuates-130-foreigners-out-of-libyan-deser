German military transport planes
evacuated about 130 foreigners out of the Libyan desert in an
operation that was approved by  Chancellor Angela Merkel  after
authorities determined that their lives were in danger.  Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said those evacuated
included 22 Germans and 56 European citizens aboard two  Transall 
military-transport aircraft. The British government ferried out
more foreigners aboard two other aircraft.  “We determined that our citizens were in a dangerous
situation, so this evacuation measure was unavoidable,”
Westerwelle told reporters today in Berlin. Merkel, Westerwelle
and Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg agreed to
undertake the military operation late on Feb. 25, he said.  The evacuation took place at a camp 1,000 kilometers (622
miles) southeast of Tripoli operated by  BASF SE ’s Wintershall
unit, which oversees eight  oil fields  in the Libyan desert.
Foreign workers had gathered at the desert camp, which includes
an airstrip, Wintershall said in an e-mailed statement.  The company said all of its international staff have now
been evacuated, oil production at the site has been suspended
and the facilities are being protected by local staff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
