Administrators to the collapsed
Icelandic banks Kaupthing Bank hf and Glitnir Bank hf have put
their stakes in the U.K. clothing retailer All Saints up for
sale, the Sunday Telegraph reported, citing an unidentified
person close to the matter.  Ernst & Young has been appointed to advise on the sale of
the minority stakes, which could value the retailer at 140
million pounds ($226 million), the newspaper reported.
