  Barclays Plc  investors plan to vote
against the bank’s pay report because of low dividends, the
Sunday Express reported, citing a councilor for the London
district of Croydon, whose pension fund owns Barclays shares.  Croydon plans talks with other local government pension
funds and institutional investors about voting against the
bank’s remuneration report to protest against the dividend-to-
staff-bonus ratio at Barclays, the Express said, citing
councilor Dudley Mead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
