  Palm Hills Developments SAE , an
Egyptian real-estate developer, denied that lenders providing it
with a 1.2 billion Egyptian-pound ($204 million) loan are
reconsidering the deal because of the referral of the company’s
chairman to trial.  “These reports are false,” said Bassem El-Shawy, director
of  investor relations  at  Palm Hills , referring to a report in  Al
Alam Al Youm  newspaper today. “Our operations run independent
of the chairman’s activities, and the banks have told us they
understand that.”  The Cairo-based developer had its stock recommendation cut
this month at HSBC Bank Middle East Ltd. and investment bank
EFG-Hermes Holding SAE. Palm Hills faces a legal claim seeking
the annulment of its purchase of a land plot from the
government, for which a Cairo-court will convene on March 1.  Former Housing Minister Ahmed El Maghraby, a Palm Hills
shareholder, is among those to have been referred to trial by  Egypt ’s public prosecutor on suspicion of squandering public
funds and profiteering. Yasseen Mansour, chairman and chief
executive officer of Palm Hills, has also been put on trial.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
