The flow of Egyptian gas to  Israel ,
which was expected to resume by the end of the month after being
halted by a terrorist attack on a Sinai facility on Feb. 5, may
be delayed a few days beyond that, TheMarker said, citing a
“government evaluation” of the situation.    East Mediterraneab Gas Co. and  Ampal-American Israel  Corp.,
which import the gas, had said they expect the flow to resume by
the end of February. A spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of
National Infrastructures was unavailable for immediate comment.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
