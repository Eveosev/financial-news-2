The  European Investment Bank  wants
to boost lending to countries such as Egypt and  Tunisia  to
promote democracy,  El Pais  reported, citing EIB President
Philippe Maystadt.  “It seems to me that the response of the European Union
isn’t in accordance with the importance of events in the
region,” Maystadt was quoted as saying in an interview with the
newspaper. “We need to act quickly especially in Egypt and
Tunisia to promote their transition to democracy.”  The EIB signed loan agreements for 2.6 billion euros ($3.6
billion) to the region last year and is waiting for approval to
boost lending to 6 billion euros from 2011 to 2013, El Pais
said, citing Maystadt.  The EIB provides funding for projects such as road and
power-plant construction in  Europe , as well as for development
projects in poorer regions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
