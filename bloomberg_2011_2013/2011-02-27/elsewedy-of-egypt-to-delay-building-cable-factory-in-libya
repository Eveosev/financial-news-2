ElSewedy Electric,  Egypt ’s largest
publicly traded maker of cables, will delay investing $65
million to build a plant in  Libya  after unrest in the North
African country.  "We were at very preliminary stages and we’ve only made
minor investments," said Ahmed El Homossani, head of  investor
relations  at ElSewedy. "We were in the process of getting a
piece of land for the project."  ElSewedy signed an agreement in 2007 with the General
Electricity Co. of Libya and the Libyan Economic Development
Fund to build the plant in Tripoli with an annual capacity of
13,600 tons of cable. ElSewedy said at the time it would have a
55 percent stake in the venture, while General Electricity Co.
and the Libyan Economic Development would own the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
