Russia picked three animals,  the
hare, polar bear and leopard,  to be official mascots of the
Sochi-2014 Winter  Olympic Games  after a television vote.  The elections show took place last night on state-run
Channel One television, with viewers voting via text message.
The Leopard, favored by  Vladimir Putin , received 28 percent of
the vote, while the Polar Bear and Hare got 18 percent and 16
percent, respectively, according to  Channel One website.   The Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee unexpectedly decided to
choose all three animals as mascots to represent the three
places on the Olympic podium, Dmitry Chernyshenko, head of the
Committee, said in a  statement , “The mascots are the choice of
the whole of our country,” he said.  Six other mascot candidates received 38 percent of votes in
total. Two, the Ray of Light and the Snowflake, were selected
for Paralympic  Winter Games  in 2014.  Putin said yesterday the snowboarding leopard would be a
“symbolic” choice as it is “strong, fast and beautiful.” The
prime minister in May released a catch on the door of a cage
letting a female Persian leopard into an enclosure at the Sochi
National Park, a week after he was shown on national television
tagging and weighing a 500-pound (230-kilogram) polar bear.
Putin also hosted a Tiger Conservation Forum in  St. Petersburg 
in November, attended by Leonardo Di Caprio.  To contact the reporters on this story:
