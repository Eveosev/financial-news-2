South Korean manufacturers’
confidence rose to a five-month high as an economic recovery
improved their sales outlook.  An index measuring expectations for March climbed to 96
from 91 for February, the Bank of  Korea  said in a statement in
Seoul today. A measure of non-manufacturing companies’
expectations rose to 85 from 84.  Asia’s fourth-largest economy expanded 6.1 percent in 2010,
the fastest pace since 2002, fueling price pressures and
prompting the Bank of Korea to raise  interest rates . Advancing
commodity and food prices threaten to push inflation higher,
with the central bank due to meet on March 10 to judge whether
the economy can absorb another increase in borrowing costs.  “Rising raw material costs, sluggish domestic demand,” and
the unfavorable “foreign-exchange rate account for a big part of
the main business hurdles,” the central bank said.  The survey was conducted from Feb. 14 to Feb. 21 and was
based on responses from 1,583 manufacturers and 860 non-
manufacturers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
