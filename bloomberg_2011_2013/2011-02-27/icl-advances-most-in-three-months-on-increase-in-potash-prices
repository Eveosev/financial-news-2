  Israel Chemicals Ltd ., which
extracts minerals from the  Dead Sea  to make fertilizer, climbed
the most in more than three months in Tel Aviv trading after
Belarusian Potash Co. increased prices.  ICL gained as much as 4.2 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since Nov. 18. The stock traded 3.1 percent higher at 59.36
shekels as of 1:39 p.m.  Belarusian Potash, a distributor for Russian and Belarusian
producers, reported a $50 increase in prices for granular potash
in Brazil for May to $520 per metric ton cost and freight for
larger buyers and $530 for smaller buyers. That compares with
April’s $470 for big buyers and $480 for smaller buyers.  “This price increase is supported by unprecedented demand
caused by exceptionally healthy crop prices and extremely tight
availability of product,” Fertecon Potash Report said Feb 25.
“BPC is sold out throughout April of this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
