Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in South Korea trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of 9:21 a.m. in Seoul.  The  Kospi Index  fell 7.39, or 0.4 percent, to 1,956.04.  Builders: Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co. (047040 KS)
lost 3 percent to 11,200 won.  GS Engineering & Construction
Corp . (006360 KS) lost 1.9 percent to 101,000 won. Builders
declined amid speculation unrest in the Middle East will hurt
demand in the region or delay ongoing projects. U.S. officials
will meet with their foreign counterparts in Geneva to discuss
the fate of  Libya , including measures to pressure  Muammar Qaddafi  out of power while building ties to opposition leaders.  “Sentiment towards construction companies continues to be
weak because of the Middle East concerns,” said Kim Young Joon,
head of equities at NH-CA Asset Management Co. in  Seoul , which
manages the equivalent of $8.8 billion in assets. “But the
possibility that builders don’t get paid for their work or will
face order cancellations is very, very low. Investors should
use the decline as a bottom-fishing opportunity.”  Daesun Shipbuilding & Engineering Co. (031990 KS) fell 4.3
percent to 22,500 won. Prosea Shipping Co. canceled contracts
for two bulk ships worth 76.9 billion won ($68 million). The
vessels were ordered in 2008 and was scheduled for delivery
later this year, the South Korean shipyard said in a filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
