Duke Snider, the Hall of Fame former
center fielder for the  Brooklyn Dodgers , died today. He was 84.  Elected to the Hall of Fame in 1980 after an 18-year major-
league career during which he hit 407 home runs, Snider died
from natural causes at the Valle Vista Convalescent Hospital in
Escondido, California, the Hall of Fame said in a statement
announcing his passing on its website.  Eight-time All-Star Snider made his debut for the Dodgers
in 1947 and hit 20 home runs in nine straight seasons. He played
11 seasons in Brooklyn and also five seasons in  Los Angeles 
following the team’s move there in 1958. He spent a season each
at the New York Mets and San Francisco Giants.  “There was no one classier or more easy going than Duke
Snider,” Jeff Idelson, president of the National Baseball Hall
of Fame and Museum, said in the statement. “He was a fan
favorite for his style of play, personality, accessibility and
fondness for playing stickball with kids in the street of  Brooklyn .”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
