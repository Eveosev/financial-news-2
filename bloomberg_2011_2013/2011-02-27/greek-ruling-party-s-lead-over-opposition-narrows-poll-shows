Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou’s lead over the opposition slipped to the narrowest
in a year as voters grew disenchanted with austerity measures to
reduce the country’s budget shortfall, a poll showed.  The Pasok socialist party received 23.2 percent in voter
preferences compared with 21.3 percent for opposition  New
Democracy , according to an MRB Hellas poll of 1,018 people for
 Real News  newspaper.  The 1.9 percentage point difference declined from November,
when the difference was 4 percentage points and has fallen
steadily since February last year, when Pasok held an 11.4
percentage point lead.  Seventy-eight percent of those asked believed the
government’s effectiveness was worsening, while 68 percent said
the government had no plan to revive growth in the economy.  More than half, or 54 percent, believed Papandreou would
fail to secure better lending and payment terms for  Greece ,
according to the poll. Papandreou hopes European Union leaders
will agree at a summit in March to lower lending rates on 110
billion euros ($151 billion) of loans extended by the EU and
International Monetary Fund and to extend the maturities to help
assuage market fears of a Greek default.  MRB conducted its poll Feb. 23-24. The margin of error is
2.5 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
