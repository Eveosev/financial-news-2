Canada’s Ivey business school will
adjust its purchasing managers’ index starting next month to
smooth seasonal variations that distort underlying trends, and
will later double the number and adjust the make-up of
respondents it surveys.  The correction for seasonal changes, such as weather and
public holidays, will be in place for the next release on March
4, said Michiel Leenders, who manages the index at the  University of Western Ontario ’s Richard Ivey School of Business.  The gauge has covered the purchasing intentions of 175
government and company managers for a decade, and also gathers
information on prices, hiring and delivery times. Many other
indicators, such as  Statistics Canada ’s merchandise trade
reports, are adjusted to remove seasonal fluctuations.  “It always had been our intention to move to seasonal
adjustment,” Leenders said in a telephone interview from the
London, Ontario-based school. “Our main concern was we had
enough data collected,” he said, adding “the financial crisis
was helpful in that it allowed us to track through bad times as
well as good times.”  The increase in the survey size will take place over the
next few months, he said. The composition of who is asked to
participate will also be adjusted to mirror changes in  Canada ’s
economic output, such as rising energy production and declining
manufacturing, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
