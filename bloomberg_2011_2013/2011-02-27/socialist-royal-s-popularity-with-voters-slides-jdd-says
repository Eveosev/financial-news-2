Former French Socialist Party
presidential candidate Segolene Royal has lost popularity among
voters, according to an Ifop poll published in Le  Journal du
Dimanche  today.  Seventy-four percent of people interviewed said it was
“not likely” they’d vote for her should she be a candidate in
2012, while 25 percent said they probably would vote for her,
according to the poll. Five years ago, when she was in the same
position as candidate for her party’s nomination, 45 percent
said they would vote for her, compared to 55 percent who said
they would probably not, the newspaper said.  Royal lost ground on people viewing her as honest, with 56
percent agreeing today compared with 76 percent in 2006, and 45
percent saying she understands their problems, compared with 59
percent five years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
