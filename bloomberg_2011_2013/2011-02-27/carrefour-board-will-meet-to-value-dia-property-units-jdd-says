  Carrefour SA ’s board will meet March
1 to review the valuation of discount supermarket chain Dia and
real estate unit Carrefour Property for possible public
listings, the  Journal du Dimanche  said today, citing an unnamed
person close to the matter.  Dia could be worth 4 billion euros ($5.5 billion) and
Carrefour Property 11 billion euros under the plan which revives
a 2008 proposal abandoned as markets fell with the economic
crisis, the newspaper said.  Chief Executive Officer Lars Olofsson will detail the plans
on March 3 when he presents the company’s annual earnings to
persuade Carrefour’s largest stakeholders, Colony Blue Investor,
Groupe Arnault and Blue Capital, a 50-50 joint holding company,
to support the project, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
