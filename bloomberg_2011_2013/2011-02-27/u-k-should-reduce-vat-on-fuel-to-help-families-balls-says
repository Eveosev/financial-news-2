U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne should reverse an increase in value-added tax on
fuel to lessen the impact of oil-price rises on drivers,
according to  Ed Balls , who speaks on the economy for the
country’s main opposition  Labour Party .  VAT, a  sales tax  which was increased to 20 percent from
17.5 percent on Jan. 4, could be reduced on fuel before the
March 23 budget, Balls said in an interview with BBC TV today.  “He should say now to families who are having a tough time
across the country ‘actually the VAT rise on fuel was a
mistake’,” Balls said. “When we were in government we often
didn’t put the duty rise through if the oil price was high.
That’s a budget decision, but he could reverse the VAT thing now
and give relief to families and hauliers.”  The previous government looked into introducing a fuel-
price stabilizer like one being considered by the Treasury,
which would cut duty when prices were high and increase it when
they were low, and found it unworkable, Balls also said.  “It is completely flawed,” Balls, who was an adviser to
former Prime Minister  Gordon Brown  when he was Chancellor of the
Exchequer, told the  Sunday Times . “It leads to instability and
some perverse outcomes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
