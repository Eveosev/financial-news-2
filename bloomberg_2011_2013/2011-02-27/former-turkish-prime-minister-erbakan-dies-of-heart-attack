Necmettin Erbakan,  Turkey ’s former
pro-Islamic prime minister, died of heart attack today, state-
run Anatolia News Agency reported. He was 85.  Erbakan, who led Turkey’s Islamic political movement for
the past four decades and fought frequently with the country’s
secular political establishment, was reelected leader of the
Islamist opposition Saadet Party in October.  Erbakan served for almost a year as prime minister before
being pressured by the secular military to step down in 1997.
The Constitutional Court closed his Welfare Party in 1998 and
its successor, the Virtue Party, in 2001.  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  and many of his Cabinet
were once members of the Welfare Party and some of the founders
of the ruling  Justice and Development Party  were defectors from
Erbakan’s parties.  In 2002, Erbakan was sentenced to two years and four months
in prison for embezzlement. The jail term was repeatedly delayed
due to ill-health and was reduced to house arrest in 2008.
President Abdullah Gul ordered Erbakan’s release from house
arrest on grounds of ill-health the same year.  Erbakan, who was a professor in mechanical engineering,
will be buried in Istanbul on March 1, Anatolia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
