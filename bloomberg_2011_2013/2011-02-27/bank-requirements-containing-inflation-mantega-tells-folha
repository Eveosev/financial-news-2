  Brazil  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said higher reserve and capital requirements are “more
effective” at containing inflation than interest rate
increases,  Folha de S.Paulo  reported, citing an interview.  Mantega is “in favor” of higher  interest rates  when there
is an “inflation problem,” the Sao Paulo-based newspaper
quoted the minster as saying. Consumer prices are under control
and economic expansion has slowed, as expected by the
government, Mantega told Folha.  Brazil’s government is withdrawing all economic stimulus
adopted during the global credit crunch to boost economic growth
and interest rates charged by the national development bank will
increase, Mantega said.  The central bank, which resumed interest rate increases
last month, increased capital and reserve requirements in
December to slow credit growth and help rein in consumer prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
