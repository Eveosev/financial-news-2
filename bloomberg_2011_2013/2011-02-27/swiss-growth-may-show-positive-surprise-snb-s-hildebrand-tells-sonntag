Swiss central bank President Philipp Hildebrand said there is a “certain potential for a positive
growth surprise” and that he doesn’t expect surging commodity
prices to threaten  price stability  in the short term,  Der
Sonntag  reported.  “In  Switzerland , price stability is assured in the short
term,” Hildebrand told the newspaper in an interview published
today. He also said that currencies are showing the “usual
pattern. Uncertainty has once again increased demand for Swiss
francs. The question is, for how long.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
