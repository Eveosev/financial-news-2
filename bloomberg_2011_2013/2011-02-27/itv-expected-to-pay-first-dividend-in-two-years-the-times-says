  ITV Plc  Chief Executive Officer Adam Crozier will this week reveal plans to pay a dividend to
shareholders for the first time in two years, the Times
reported, without saying it where it got the information.  The broadcaster’s annual underlying profit may have tripled
last year to more than 300 million pounds ($483.5 million) on
increased advertising revenue, the Times said. Crozier also
plans to combine three of the company’s news-gathering
operations to cut costs from a 100-million pound news budget,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
