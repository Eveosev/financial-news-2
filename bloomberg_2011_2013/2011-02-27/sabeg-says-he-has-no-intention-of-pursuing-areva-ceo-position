Yazid Sabeg, cited in press reports
as a possible successor to  Areva SA  Chief Executive Officer  Anne
Lauvergeon , has “no particular intention” of taking the post,
he said in an interview with French television channel iTele.  Sabeg was one of four possible candidates selected by a
special Areva committee for Lauvergeon’s job, weekly magazine
Challenges reported last month. The CEO’s mandate ends in June,
though she may also request it be renewed.  Sabeg, the chairman of CS Communications et Systemes, has
links to French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s ruling UMP majority,
serving as a government commissioner for diversity and equal
opportunities, according to his  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
