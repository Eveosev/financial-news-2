Almost 100,000 people have crossed  Libya ’s borders with Egypt and Tunisia amid a “humanitarian
emergency,” the  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees  said in a  statement  today.  Those fleeing the unrest in Libya include at least 61,000
Egyptians and 18,000 Tunisians, as well as Chinese and other
Asians, the Geneva-based agency said.  The eastern border region faces a “critical shortage” of
food and medical supplies, according to the agency.  “We call upon the international community to respond
quickly and generously,” said Antonio Guterres, the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
