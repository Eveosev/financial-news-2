Israeli fixed-rate government bond
fund outflows were the biggest in more than a year last week
amid increasing political turmoil in  Libya , according to Meitav
Investment House Ltd. Government bond yields slid.  Investors pulled 320 million shekels ($87.6 million) from
fixed-rate bond funds, the biggest redemption since July 2009,
while 290 million shekels were withdrawn from inflation-linked
funds, the 13th week of redemptions, Tel Aviv-based Meitav said
today.    Israel ’s mutual-fund industry can’t remain unaffected by
the bloody events in Libya that have intensified in the last few
days,” Rony After, mutual funds analyst at Meitav, wrote in an
e-mailed report. The regional instability is pushing Israelis to
flee investments in mutual funds, After said.  The benchmark 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit climbed the most
this year, pushing the yield down 6 basis points to 5.04 percent
at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . The yield increased 7 basis
points last week. The Tel-Bond 40 Index of corporate bonds
gained 0.5 percent, paring back a 0.5 percent loss last week.  Concern political upheaval in North Africa and the Middle
East would disrupt supplies drove the price of crude oil to
$103.41 a barrel last week, the highest since September 2008.
Libya holds the largest proven oil reserves in  Africa .  Popular uprisings have swept the Middle East since the
toppling of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in
January. A revolt forced Egyptian leader  Hosni Mubarak  out on
Feb. 11. Demonstrations also have taken place in Yemen, Jordan,
Egypt, Iraq and Tunisia.  The shekel gained 0.1 percent to 3.6525 per dollar on Feb.
