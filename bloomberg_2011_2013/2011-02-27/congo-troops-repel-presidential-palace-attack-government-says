Democratic Republic of Congo troops
repelled an attack by armed men on the residence of President
Joseph Kabila that left seven dead.  The unidentified gunmen “were trying to harm the
president” during the incident today in the capital, Kinshasa,
government spokesman Lambert Mende said on national television.  Seven of the attackers were killed, and one member of the
President’s republican guard was “seriously wounded,” Mende
said in a separate interview tonight. Unconfirmed reports
suggested that “around 50” men attacked the residence, and
sixteen were arrested, he said.  Congo’s second presidential elections since the end of
almost a decade of war are scheduled for November. Kabila, 39,
became the country’s leader in 2001 when his father, Laurent- Desire Kabila, was assassinated. The younger Kabila led the
country through a postwar transitional government from 2003 to
2006, when he was elected president.  The gunmen were “enemies of peace” who wanted to disrupt
the coming elections, Mende said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
