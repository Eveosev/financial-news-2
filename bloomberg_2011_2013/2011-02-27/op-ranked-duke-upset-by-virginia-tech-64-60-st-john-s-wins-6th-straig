Jeff Allen scored 18 points and
grabbed 15 rebounds to rally Virginia Tech to a 64-60 upset
over top-ranked  Duke University  in a college basketball
Atlantic Coast Conference game.  In a Big East Conference contest, No. 25 St. John’s
University defeated Villanova University 81-68. In other games,
the University of Colorado beat fifth-ranked University of
Texas 91-89; the University of  California ,  Los Angeles  routed
10th ranked University of Arizona 71-49; and 20th-ranked
Syracuse University upset No. 11 Georgetown University 58-51.  At the Cassell Coliseum in Blacksburg, Virginia, the Hokies
handed the Blue Devils their second loss in the ACC and third
defeat overall for the season as they went on a 15-4 run to
rally from a 53-47 deficit to reach a 62-57 lead with two
minutes left in the game.  “A lot of teams, down six to Duke, would have just folded
up and let Duke put the game away, but we didn’t,” said
Malcolm Delaney, guard for the  Virginia  Tech Hokies. “We
buckled up and got stops.”  Besides Allen, the other four starters for Virginia Tech
(19-8, 9-5 ACC) also scored in the double digits as they
snapped Duke’s seven-game winning streak. Terrell Bell and
Erick Green each contributed 12 points, while Victor Davila and
Delaney added 11 each.  Kyle Singler had 22 points and 12 rebounds for the Blue
Devils (26-3, 12-2 ACC) and Nolan Smith scored 18 points.  ‘Road Warrior Mentality’  At the Pavilion in Villanova,  Pennsylvania , Dwight Hardy
tallied a career-high 34 points to give the Red Storm (19-9,11-
5 Big East) its sixth straight victory with its win over
Villanova.  “Our players are starting to learn how to have a road
warrior mentality,” said Steve Lavin,  St. John’s  coach.  Paris Horne’s jumper five minutes into the game put the
Red Storm ahead 18-4. At the end of the first half, St. John’s
had a 41-37 lead.  Horne and D.J. Kennedy each scored 12 points and Justin
Brownlee added 11 for St. John’s, which has been victorious
over Georgetown, Notre Dame, Duke,  Connecticut  and Pittsburgh
this season.  Corey Stokes had 20 points and Maalik Wayns scored 19 for
the Wildcats (21-8, 9-7 Big East).  To contact the reporter on this story:
