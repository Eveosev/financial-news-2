  Costain Group Plc , the construction
company that bid 180 million pounds ($290 million) for road-
maintenance company Mouchel Group Plc, may scrap the proposal
after competitor  Interserve Plc  made a higher offer, the Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Interserve’s bid of as much as 197 million pounds is
considered by Mouchel to be a “straightforward slam dunk,” the
Times said, citing unnamed sources close to the company. Costain
will tomorrow consult with shareholders before making a final
decision on whether to end the offer, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
