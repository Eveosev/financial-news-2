OAO Silvinit’s minority shareholders
filed a court claim Feb. 24 seeking to block the company’s
merger with another potash producer, OAO  Uralkali , according to
the Moscow-based Investor Protection Association.  Members of the association and fertilizer maker OAO Acron,
which holds an 8 percent stake in Silvinit, filed the claim to
the arbitrage court of  Russia ’s Perm region seeking injunctions
to stop the merger as “the company’s valuation for the deal is
unfair,” said Igor Repin, a spokesman for the association.  Acron spokeswoman Elena Kochubey confirmed the claim was
filed. Silvinit spokesman Anton Subbotin declined to comment.  The merger was supported by 99 percent of Uralkali
investors and 91 percent of Silvinit holders, and is beneficial
for both companies, Uralkali said by e-mail today. “We plan to
complete it by the end of the second quarter as scheduled.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
