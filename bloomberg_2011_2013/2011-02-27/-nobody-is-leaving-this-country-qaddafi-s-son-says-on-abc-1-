Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s son
Saif said “nobody is leaving this country” on ABC’s “This
Week” program. “We live here. We die here.”  Saif Qaddafi said the regime’s military hasn’t attacked
civilians and that most of  Libya  is calm. There is “a big gap
between reality and the media reports,” he said on ABC.  “Show me a single attack, show me a single bomb,” he
said. “The Libyan  air force  destroyed just the ammunition
sites,” Saif Qaddafi said.  Protests urging the ouster of Muammar Qaddafi have been met
with a crackdown. Qaddafi has bolstered defenses in the capital,
Tripoli, and launched counter-strikes against opponents. United
Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said more than 1,000
people have died in the unrest, which has left protesters in
control of much of the east of the country.  “The whole south is calm,” Saif Qaddafi said. “The west
is calm. The middle is calm. Even part of the east.”  In response to a question from ABC about U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s call for his father to step down, Saif Qaddafi
said “It’s not an American business.”  The UN Security Council late yesterday voted unanimously to
freeze Qaddafi’s assets and protesters in the east of the
country said they were naming a provisional government.  “We don’t have money outside,” Saif Qaddafi told ABC.
“We are a very modest family and everybody knows that. And we
are laughing when they say you have money in Europe or  Switzerland  or something. C’mon, it’s a joke.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
