  TransCanada Corp . will begin
accepting spot shipments as Line 3 in its three-pipe Canadian
Mainline natural-gas system is returned to service after an
explosion and fire in northern Ontario shut Line 2 on Feb. 19.  TransCanada will begin taking discretionary shipments on
the system starting today, the Calgary-based company said in a
posting on its  website . The company didn’t say when Line 2 would
be returned to service.  The system links natural gas fields in  Alberta  with points
in central  Canada  and terminates at the Quebec-Vermont border.
Line 2 of the three-tube system exploded, then burned for about
eight hours after operators closed valves from a remote control
room.  Line 1 or the system was returned to service Feb. 20. The
blast site is about 170 kilometers (105 miles) north of Thunder
Bay, Ontario.  TransCanada’s mainline system can carry as much as 7
billion cubic feet of gas a day. Shipments averaged about 3.4
billion cubic feet daily in 2010, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
