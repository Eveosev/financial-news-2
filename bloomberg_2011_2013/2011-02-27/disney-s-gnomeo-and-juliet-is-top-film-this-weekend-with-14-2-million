Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube video website
plans to add movie rentals from major studios including  Sony
Corp. (6758) ’s  Columbia Pictures  and  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s  Universal Pictures ,
according to people with knowledge of the situation.  Sony has agreed to offer its films and Universal is
discussing an accord with YouTube, said the people, who weren’t
authorized to speak publicly. Warner Bros., a unit of  Time
Warner Inc. (TWX) , has also agreed to provide movies, according to
TheWrap.com, which reported the developments on April 25.  Adding films from major studios would boost YouTube’s
ability to compete for paying viewers against  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
ITunes, Amazon.com Inc. and other online outlets such as Best
Buy and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s Vudu. YouTube now offers movies
such as “3:10 to Yuma” from  Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF)   “We’ve steadily been adding more and more titles since
launching movies for rent on YouTube over a year ago and now
have thousands of titles available,” Google said in an e-mailed
statement. “Outside of that, we don’t comment on rumor or
speculation.”  Google, based in  Mountain View ,  California , rose $7.77
yesterday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have
declined 10 percent this year.  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s 20th Century Fox and  Viacom Inc. (VIA/B) ’s Paramount
Pictures aren’t involved, TheWrap and the New York Times
reported.  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , which rents movies through Apple
Inc.’s iTunes, is on the sidelines for now, the publications
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
