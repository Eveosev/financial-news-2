  Tesco Plc , the U.K.’s biggest
supermarket company, this week will promise to pay customers
double the price difference on products that are cheaper at Wal-
Mart Stores Inc.’s Asda, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  Tesco will also announce 200 million pounds ($322 million)
of new price cuts, the Telegraph said, citing the retailer.  Asda last month started a campaign promising to be 10
percent cheaper than rivals or it will refund the difference.
