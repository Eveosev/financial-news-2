Chelsea and England defender  Ashley Cole  allegedly accidentally wounded a work-placement student
with an air rifle at the soccer team’s training ground, the News
of the World reported, citing an unidentified person at the
club.  Chelsea medical staff treated the 21-year intern for a
pellet wound and he wasn’t taken to hospital, the newspaper
said, adding that Cole had since apologized to the student.
Police weren’t called to the incident at Cobham, south of
London, the News of the World said.  Premier League club Chelsea’s spokesman Steve Atkins didn’t
immediately return a call from Bloomberg News seeking comment.
The U.K.’s Press Association cited Chelsea as saying “we never
comment on internal matters.”  A call to Surrey police, which covers Cobham, wasn’t
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
