Hellermann Tyton has been put up for
sale for 700 million pounds ($1.13 billion) by its private-
equity owner Doughty Hanson & Co., the Mail on Sunday reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.  UBS AG will handle the sale of the company, which makes
clips and fixings for the automotive, construction and broadband
industries, the paper said. Doughty Hanson bought Hellermann
Tyton in 2005 for 288 million pounds, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
