Several  Deutsche Bank AG  executives
are against Bundesbank President Axel Weber possibly succeeding
Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann ,  Die Welt am Sonntag 
reported, citing management and supervisory board members.  Weber, who announced his resignation as head of  Germany ’s
central bank Feb. 11, lacks private banking experience and
damaged his reputation with German politicians by his abrupt
departure, Die Welt quoted Deutsche Bank executives as saying.  Ackermann, who has said no talks are being conducted with
Weber, is viewed as supporting Weber’s candidacy and the
supervisory board has Weber on a list of possible outside
candidates that names fewer than five people, Welt reported.  Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank declined to comment on
speculation about Weber’s possible succession. The supervisory
board will proceed with its choice of the bank’s next CEO “in
an orderly and professional way” when the time comes, bank
spokesman Klaus Thoma said today by phone.  “There is no reason for haste, since Dr. Ackermann’s
contract runs for another two years,” Thoma said. Bundesbank
spokeswoman Susanne Mehlhorn declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
