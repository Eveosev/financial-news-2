Nigeria today evacuated 499 of its
citizens stranded in Libya, a spokesman for the National
Emergency Management Agency said.  “NEMA is coordinating other agencies to bring back about
2,000 Nigerians,” spokesman Yushau Shuaib said by phone.  Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  came under increased pressure
as the  United Nations Security Council  voted unanimously to
freeze his assets and protesters controlling the east of the
country said they were naming a provisional government.  Almost 100,000 people have crossed Libya’s borders with
Egypt and Tunisia amid a “humanitarian emergency,” the Office
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva
said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
