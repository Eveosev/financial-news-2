Russian arms exports may be harmed
by unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, Interfax said
citing Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov.    Russia  may lose as much as $4 billion of signed and
perspective arms contracts after the  United Nations Security
Council  imposed sanctions on  Libya , which used to be one the
major buyers of Russian arms in the region, Interfax reported
separately, citing an unidentified military source.  To contact the reporters on this story:
