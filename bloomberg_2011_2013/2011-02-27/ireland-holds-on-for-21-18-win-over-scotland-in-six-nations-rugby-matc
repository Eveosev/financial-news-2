Ireland defeated  Scotland  21-18 for
its second win in this year’s Six Nations rugby tournament.  The Irish outscored Scotland by three tries to nil in
Edinburgh as the losers slid to a third straight defeat in the
third round of games this year.  The visitors took control with tries in the first half by
Jamie Heaslip and Eoin Reddan, both converted by Ronan O’Gara,
for a 14-9 halftime lead. Chris Paterson got three penalties for
the hosts before the interval.  O’Gara converted his own try to stretch the lead to 21-9,
before the advantage was narrowed to 21-18 by a Paterson penalty
and a penalty and drop goal from Dan Parks.  “I think we were very good at times today and very poor at
times but in the end it’s all about winning and that’s what we
did,” O’Gara told the British Broadcasting Corp.  Yesterday  England  defeated France 17-9 at Twickenham to
remain unbeaten in the Six Nations and hand the defending
champion its first loss. Wales beat Italy 24-16 in Rome.  England leads the standings on six points, followed by
Wales, France and Ireland on four. Scotland and Italy have no
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
