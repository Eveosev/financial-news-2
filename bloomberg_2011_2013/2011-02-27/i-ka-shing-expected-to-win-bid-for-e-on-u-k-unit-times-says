Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong’s richest man
and one of Britain’s biggest foreign investors, is close to
buying  E.ON AG ’s 3.7-billion pound ($6 billion) U.K. power
distribution network, the Times reported, without saying where
it got the information.  Li’s Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd., which is
said to have outbid the U.S. utility company  PPL Corp . for the
unit, will control half of the U.K.’s electricity network if its
offer is accepted, the Times said.  Germany’s E.ON, which put the business up for sale last
year, is expected to announce the winning bid as soon as this
week, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
