  Australia  kept its position as the
world’s second-largest producer of gold with a 17 percent
increase in output of the precious metal last year, a research
group said.  Production rose 38 metric tons to 266 tons in 2010 from a
year earlier, Sandra Close, a director of Melbourne-based
 Surbiton Associates Pty , said in an e-mailed statement.  Gold is trading near record highs as investors seek to
protect their wealth against accelerating inflation and
intensifying violence in the Middle East. Prices have risen for
10 straight years to reach a record $1,432.50 an ounce on Dec. 7
on the Comex in  New York . Gold’s role as an inflation hedge will
grow as consumer prices increase worldwide, Credit Suisse AG
analyst Stefan Graber said Feb. 22.  China was No. 1 with reported production of 341 tons and
the U.S. would rank No. 3 with an output of about 240 tons,
Close said.  Australian output gained 12 percent to 70 tons in the
fourth quarter, Surbiton said.    Newmont Mining Corp .’s Boddington mine, southeast of Perth,
was Australia’s largest single producer during the quarter with
206,000 ounces. The Superpit, 550 kilometers (342 miles) east of
Perth and a joint venture of Newmont and  Barrick Gold Corp .,
remained Australia’s largest producer for the year with 788,000
ounces, Surbiton said.
