Duke Snider, the Hall of Fame center
fielder who in 1955 led the Dodgers to their only World Series
win while in  Brooklyn , died yesterday. He was 84.  Snider, the Dodgers’ all-time leader with 389 career home
runs, died from natural causes at the Valle Vista Convalescent
Hospital in Escondido,  California , the Hall of Fame said in a
 statement  on its website.  Snider played 16 of his 18 Major League Baseball seasons
with the Dodgers, including 11 in Brooklyn before the franchise
moved to Los Angeles. He played during a golden age for New York
center fielders, with fellow Hall of Fame members Willie Mays
playing for the Giants and  Mickey Mantle  on the Yankees.  “Duke was a fine man, a terrific hitter and a great friend
-- even though he was a Dodger,” Mays said in comments on the
National Baseball Hall of Fame’s  website . “It was great playing
centerfield in  New York  in the 1950s along with Mickey and Duke.
I feel that I have lost a dear friend. He was a hero to the fans
in Brooklyn and a great Dodger.”  An eight-time All-Star, Snider had a career .295 batting
average with 407 homers, 1,333 runs batted in and 1,259 runs
scored. He made his major-league debut for the Dodgers in 1947
and hit 40 or more homers in his final five seasons at Ebbets
Field in Brooklyn from 1953-57.  Snider led the Dodgers to a championship in 1955, when he
was runner-up for the National League Most Valuable Player award
after hitting .309 with 42 homers, 126 runs scored and 136 RBI.
Snider and the Dodgers had lost to the Yankees in the  World
Series  in 1949, 1952 and 1953 before beating their American
League rivals in 1955 and losing to them in 1956.  ‘Fan Favorite’  In 27 World Series games against the Yankees from 1952-56,
Snider -- known to Brooklyn fans as “The Duke of Flatbush” --
hit .323 with 10 home runs and 24 RBI.  “There was no one classier or more easygoing than Duke
Snider,” said Jeff Idelson, president of baseball’s Hall of
Fame and Museum. “He was a fan favorite for his style of play,
personality, accessibility and fondness for playing stickball
with kids in the streets of Brooklyn.”  The era of 1950s New York center fielders featured
prominently in Terry Cashman’s 1981 song “Talkin’ Baseball,”
which has the refrain, “Willie, Mickey and the Duke.”  “He was a key player during a special era in baseball,
joining  Willie Mays  and Mickey Mantle to form  New York City ’s
unparalleled triumvirate of center fielders,” Baseball
Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement. “Then the Los
Angeles native went home and helped usher in a new part of
baseball history with great class.”  Three-Sport Standout  Born in Compton, California, on Sept. 19, 1926, Edwin
Donald Snider was given the nickname Duke by his father at age
five. Snider was a standout in baseball, football and basketball
at Compton High School before signing with the Dodgers in 1943
at age 17.  Snider briefly played in the minor leagues before serving
in the Navy in 1945. He returned to baseball the next year, made
his Dodgers’ debut in 1947 and became a starter in 1949, when he
hit .292 with 23 homers and 92 RBI.  After 11 years in Brooklyn, Snider won another World Series
title in 1959, the Dodgers’ second season in  Los Angeles . Snider
played with the  New York Mets  in 1963 and joined the rival
Giants -- and Mays -- for his final season in 1964. Following
his playing career, he returned to the Dodgers’ organization as
a minor league manager.  “He was a World Series hero that will forever be
remembered in the borough of Brooklyn,” Dodgers’ Hall of Fame
broadcaster Vin Scully said in a statement. “Although it’s
ironic to say it, we have lost a giant. He’s joining a great
Dodger team that has moved on and I extend my sympathies to his
entire family.”  Hall of Fame  Snider was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1980 and his
Dodgers’ No. 4 uniform was retired that year in ceremonies that
featured Snider entering the ballpark from centerfield
accompanied by Mays and ex-Yankee center fielder  Joe DiMaggio .  “He was the true Dodger and represented the Dodgers to the
highest degree of class, dignity and character,” said Hall of
Fame manager Tommy Lasorda, who played alongside Snider in
Brooklyn in 1954-55 before managing the Dodgers for 22 years.
“He was my teammate and friend and I will really miss him.”  Funeral arrangements are pending, the Dodgers said.  Snider is survived by his wife Bev, whom he married in
1947; sons Kevin and Kurt; daughters Pam Chodola and Dawna
Amino; and 10 grandchildren.  To contact the reporter on this story:
