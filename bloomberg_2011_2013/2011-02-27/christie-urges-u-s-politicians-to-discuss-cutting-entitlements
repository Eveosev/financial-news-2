New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
said the American people “are ready for a frank, adult
conversation” about raising the  retirement age  and controlling
the costs of government health-care programs.  The costs of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid
represent the “overall majority” of the nation’s spending
problem, Christie said today on the CBS program “Face the
Nation.” Unless officials deal with controlling them “those
three are going to eat up everything else.”  In a speech to the American Enterprise Institute last week,
the first-term Republican governor suggested raising the
retirement age for Social Security, which consumes about  20
percent  of the federal budget.  “Oh, ho, I just said it, and I’m still standing here. I
did not vaporize into the carpeting,” he said in his speech.  Those born in 1960 and later can receive the maximum
benefit at 67, according to the  Social Security Administration .  The U.S. deficit will widen this year to $1.6 trillion,
President  Barack Obama , a Democrat, said in his fiscal 2012
budget proposal sent to Congress on Feb. 14.  Politicians should publicly discuss raising the retirement
age and other politically controversial moves to help rein in
the deficit, Christie, 48, said today.  “Stop being afraid and stop selling the people of America
short,” said Christie, who was in  Washington  attending the
winter meeting of the National Governors Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
