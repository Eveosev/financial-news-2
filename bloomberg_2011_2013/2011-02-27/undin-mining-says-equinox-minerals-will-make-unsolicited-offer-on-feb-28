  Lundin Mining Corp . said it received
notice that  Equinox Minerals Ltd . will make an unsolicited
takeover bid for the company before markets open tomorrow.  Lundin doesn’t know the terms Equinox will offer, the
Toronto-based company said today in a statement.  It would be the second deal this year for Equinox, owner of  Africa ’s biggest copper mine. The company purchased Citadel
Resource Group Ltd. in January for $1.2 billion, its first
acquisition in six years, to add Saudi Arabia’s biggest copper
deposit. Buying Lundin would give it operations in Portugal,
Spain and Sweden.  Lundin fell 1 cent to C$6.45 on Feb. 25 in Toronto Stock
Exchange trading. The shares are down 11 percent this year.  West Perth, Australia-based Equinox rose 1.8 percent to
C$6.27 in Toronto and has gained 2.6 percent so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
