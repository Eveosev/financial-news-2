  New Zealand ’s dollar strengthened
for a second day against the yen as gains in global stocks
revived demand for higher-yielding currencies.  The currency, nicknamed the kiwi, also advanced after data
showed New Zealand posted its first  trade surplus  in seven
months in January. Australia’s dollar erased losses against its
U.S. counterpart after weakening earlier on concern exports will
slow after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao cut his nation’s economic-
growth forecasts.  “There is a move toward unwinding of risk-aversion
positions overall,” said Tomohiro Nishida, a Tokyo-based
foreign-currency dealer at Chuo Mitsui Trust & Banking Co., a
unit of Japan’s seventh-largest banking group.  New Zealand’s dollar rose 0.2 percent to 61.53 yen at 12:57
p.m. in  New York , from 61.39 yen on Feb. 25. The kiwi was little
changed at 75.18 U.S. cents after falling as much as 0.4
percent, from 75.16 last week.  The Australian dollar gained 0.3 percent to 83.35 yen, from
83.12. The Aussie traded at $1.0178, compared with $1.0177 last
week, after earlier falling 0.6 percent to $1.0120.  The  MSCI World  Index of stocks rose for a second day,
gaining 0.7 percent.  The kiwi touched the highest level versus the Japanese
currency in three days, 61.71 yen, after Statistics New Zealand
said exports outpaced imports by NZ$11 million ($8 million) in
January. That compared with a revised NZ$264 million deficit in
December.  Australia’s currency weakened earlier after Wen said
yesterday that  China  set an annual economic expansion target of
7 percent for its 12th 5-year plan period, which covers 2011
through 2015. The target was 7.5 percent for the period from
2006 through 2010, with actual growth surpassing that each year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
