Glencore International AG hired five
banks in addition to three financial advisers to prepare the
Swiss commodities trader for an initial share sale, the Sunday
Telegraph said, without saying where it got the information.    Goldman Sachs Group Inc . and Bank of America Corp.â€™s
Merrill Lynch unit may be two of the new banks, joining
Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and  Morgan Stanley , the
newspaper said, without providing the names of other banks.  Analysts from the eight banks will attend a presentation
this week led by Glencore Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg, the newspaper said.  Simon Buerk, a spokesman for Baar, Switzerland-based
Glencore, declined to comment when contacted by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
