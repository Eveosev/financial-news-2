Romania ’s population fell by 2.6
million people in the past decade as more Romanians left the
country and fewer babies were born, the  National Statistics
Institute  said today.  The Balkan nation’s population declined to 19.04 million
from 21.68 million in 2002, the preliminary results of a census
conducted last year by the statistics institute show. About 53
percent of the country’s population lives in the urban area,
while 47 percent in the rural area, the institute said.  Romania, which joined the European Union in 2007, remains
the second-poorest country in the 27-state block after
neighboring  Bulgaria , as its economy dropped a cumulated 8.4
percent in 2009 and 2010 amid the global crisis. The economy
probably grew 2.5 percent last year, according to the
 International Monetary Fund .  About 1.7 million Romanians live in the capital Bucharest,
the census data show, while about 1 million live outside the
country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
