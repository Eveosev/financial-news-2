This week’s mild weather may give way
to slightly lower temperatures next week in the U.S. Northeast,
according to forecasters.  After rising to 62 degrees Fahrenheit (17 Celsius) in  New
York  City yesterday, 23 above normal, average temperatures are
expected to be 3 to 4 degrees higher than usual in most of the
East from Feb. 7 to Feb. 11, according to a 6- to 10-day outlook
from MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  “This period contains some marginal cool variability for
parts of the eastern half, but most of the stronger cold will
remain north of the border over Ontario and Quebec,” MDA said.  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC,
calls for more seasonal weather in the region during that
period, while Weather Derivatives owner  David Salmon  predicts in
his 6- to 10-day forecast that temperatures will be about 2
degrees above normal.  Traders use long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and demand for heating and cooling.  Power plants 
consume about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according
to Energy Department data.  The high temperature in New York’s Central Park yesterday
was 5 degrees shy of the record for the day of 67 in 1989, the
 National Weather Service  said. In  Boston , the high was 59,
Philadelphia had 67 and  Washington  had 72.  Today’s Forecast  New York is forecast to be 50 degrees today under partly
sunny skies, according to the weather service. In Chicago, the
high is expected to reach 47 while Washington is expected to
have a high of 54 with rain.  As mild weather continues in most of the eastern, blizzard
warnings and watches have been posted for parts of  Colorado ,
Kansas and Nebraska, according to the weather service.  Denver may receive 8 to 16 inches (20 to 41 centimeters) of
snow by tomorrow, with 12 to 24 inches possible through eastern
Colorado, the agency said. The storm will also bring winds of 20
to 35 miles per hour and gusts as high as 50 mph.  By the end of next week, milder weather may be returning to
much of the U.S. with temperatures from the northern Great
Plains to the Northeast possibly reaching 8 to 14 degrees above
normal, according to MDA in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  In his 11- to 15-day forecast for the same time period,
Rogers predicts the mildest air will be in the northern U.S.
from Minnesota to the  New England  and the Canadian Maritimes.
Temperatures there are expected to range about 8 degrees above
normal, said Rogers, based in Bethesda,  Maryland .  Salmon, in Belton, Missouri, doesn’t issue an 11- to 15-day
forecast.  The normal average temperature in New York for Feb. 10 is
about 35 degrees, according to MDA. In Boston, it’s 31; in
Chicago, 27; Atlanta, 46; Houston, 54; Seattle, 43; and Burbank,
 California , 56.  To contact the reporter on this story:
