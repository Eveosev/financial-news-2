Gold rose to a two-month high after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said he sees signs the
 U.S. economy  is improving, boosting prospects for commodity
demand.  “Indicators of spending, production, and job-market
activity have shown some signs of improvement,” Bernanke said
today in prepared testimony to the House Budget Committee in
Washington. Improving growth prospects will help buoy gold as
“deflationary concerns subside,” said  Scott Gardner , the chief
investment officer at Verdmont Capital SA in Panama.  “When economic news comes in better than expected, it
boosts commodities, including gold,” Gardner said in an e-mail.  Gold futures for April delivery gained 0.6 percent to
settle at $1,759.30 an ounce at 1:35 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , after reaching $1,763.80, the highest since Dec. 2. The
metal climbed 11 percent last month, the biggest January rally
since 1983.  Gold also got a boost from investors seeking a haven
against inflation, after Bernanke cautioned that the U.S.
outlook is still “uncertain,” boosting speculation that the
Fed will increase stimulus measures to continue the expansion.
Last month, the central bank pledged to keep the benchmark U.S.
interest rate low until at least late 2014.  “People are speculating that very soon the Fed may talk
about quantitative easing,” Sterling Smith, an analyst at
 Country Hedging  in St Paul, Minnesota, said in a telephone
interview.  Silver futures for March delivery climbed 1.1 percent to
$34.175 an ounce in New York, after touching $34.35, the highest
since Nov. 16.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery advanced 0.4 percent to $1,629.90 an ounce,
climbing for the second straight day. Palladium futures for
March delivery rose 1.6 percent to $707.65 an ounce, jumping the
most in more than a week.  To contact the reporter for this story:
