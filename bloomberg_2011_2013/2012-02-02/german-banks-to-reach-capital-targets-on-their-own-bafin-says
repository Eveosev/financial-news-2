Germany ’s banks are set to reach the
European Banking Authority’s capital requirements on their own,
according to German financial regulator Bafin.  “The plans the institutes have presented to us show that
they should be successful in reaching the EBA’s recommended
capitalization on their own strength,” Elke Koenig, president
of Bafin, said in a speech in  Frankfurt  today.  The EBA’s new capital rules require euro-area banks to
achieve a 9 percent core Tier 1 capital ratio by the middle of
this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
