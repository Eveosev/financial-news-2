A ferry carrying as many as 350
people sank off the coast of  Papua New Guinea .  Merchant ships in the area rescued 238 people, the
Australian Maritime Safety Authority said in a  statement . It
didn’t say anything about fatalities. The area is experiencing
strong winds and 5-meter sea swells, it said.  The MV Rabaul Queen sank at about 7:30 a.m. local time,
about nine nautical miles (16 kilometers) off Finschhafen, while
sailing between the Papua New Guinea towns of Kimbe and Lae,
according to the Australian government.  Australia , which
neighbors the Pacific nation, arranged for ships to help with
rescue efforts and deployed planes to search for survivors and
drop life rafts.  Two Australian rescue aircraft will remain in Papua New
Guinea overnight, the Australian safety agency said. Search
efforts are expected to continue tomorrow, it said.  There will probably be a “very high loss of life,”
Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  told reporters in
Melbourne earlier today.  The vessel was operated by Star Ships, the Australian
Associated Press reported. Phone calls and e-mailed messages to
Star Ships PNG Ltd. weren’t answered.  The number of people on board the ferry may be closer to
300 people, the Associated Press said, citing Papua New Guinea’s
National Maritime Safety Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
