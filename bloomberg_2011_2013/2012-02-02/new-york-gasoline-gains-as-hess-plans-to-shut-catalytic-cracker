Gasoline in  New York  Harbor
strengthened as Hess Corp. scheduled the shutdown of a catalytic
cracker tomorrow for maintenance at its Port Reading refinery in
 New Jersey .  The duration of repairs at the 70,000-barrel-a-day plant
won’t be known until after the unit is halted, the company said
in an e-mailed statement today.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  New
York Harbor (MOSNY87P)  strengthened 0.25 cent to 1.88 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:46 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
4.56 cents to $2.8629 a gallon.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel  at the hub  weakened
0.5 cent to 1.75 cents a gallon versus heating oil futures as
European gasoil inventories rose. Prompt delivery slipped 1.7
cents to $3.051 a gallon.  Gasoil stockpiles, including heating oil and diesel, in
independent storage in  Europe ’s oil-trading hub gained for a
third week to the highest level in more than five months,
according to PJK International BV.  Gasoil inventories in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp increased
4.8 percent to 2.54 million metric tons in the week to today,
according to PJK, a researcher in the Netherlands. That’s the
most since July 14.  The Netherlands was the biggest importer of distillate fuel
from the U.S. in 2010, taking in 115,000 barrels a day,
according to the  U.S. Energy Information Agency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
