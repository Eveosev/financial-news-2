Ros Agro, a Russian grain and sugar
producer listed in  London , missed its profit target for last
year after a bumper beet harvest pushed domestic sugar prices
lower, Chief Executive Officer Maxim Basov said.  “Our company’s financial results last year are apparently
lower than our own expectations and those of most analysts,”
Basov said in an  interview in Moscow today, declining to be
more specific until the Ros Agro publishes its annual report.  Domestic sugar prices fell to as low as 17 rubles a
kilogram last year, Basov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
