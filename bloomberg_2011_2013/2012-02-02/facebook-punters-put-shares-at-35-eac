The odds are pointing to  Facebook 
Inc. pricing its IPO at between $35 and $44.99 a share in the $5
billion initial public offering it filed for yesterday,
according to the Irish bookmaker  Paddy Power Plc. (PAP)   Facebook, based in  Menlo Park ,  California , will price the
new shares within that range at odds of 10 to 11, according to
an e-mailed statement from Paddy Power. The likelihood of the
social-networking website selling shares as low as $25 stands at
7 to 2, and at 9 to 2 for prices of more than $65, the gambling
company site said.  “With Facebook now a part of most of our day-to-day lives,
the IPO was always going to get people talking,” Feilim Mac An
Iomaire, a spokesman for Dublin-based Paddy Power, said in the
statement. “The odds would suggest that the price will fall
between $35 and $44.99, but given Facebook’s history of
exceeding expectations, I don’t think we can rule anything
out.”  Paddy Power customers are also betting on who will ring the
opening bell for Facebook in its debut. While Chief Executive
Officer Mark Zuckerberg leads with odds of 1 to 100, betters are
also wagering on Facebook’s former president Sean Parker (25 to
1),  Microsoft (MSFT)  Corp.’s co-founder Bill Gates (50 to 1) and the
Irish rock band U2’s lead singer Bono (100 to 1) as candidates.  Bono is a co-founder and managing director of Elevation
Partners LP, an investor in Facebook. Microsoft put $240 million
into Facebook in 2007. Odds of 100 to 1 mean a gambler betting 1
euro would win 100 euros and their stake back.  Meteoric Rise  Facebook, whose meteoric rise spawned an Oscar-winning film
and captivated  Wall Street , yesterday named  Morgan Stanley (MS)  as
the lead underwriter on its IPO, while reporting a 24-fold
increase in sales over the past four years to $3.71 billion in
2011.  Co-founded in 2004 by  Mark Zuckerberg , now 27, Facebook has
grown into the world’s dominant social-networking site,
squelching competitors such as MySpace Inc. with its more than
800 million users. While Facebook’s sales almost doubled last
year, the company faces increasing competition from rivals such
as Google Inc., which debuted its own social-networking service
last year, and from the microblogging site Twitter Inc., the
filing shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
