The dollar fell against the majority
of its most-traded counterparts as stocks and growth-linked
currencies rose, boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  The dollar earlier rose against the euro as  Greece 
struggled to reach an agreement with its bondholders on cutting
the nation’s debt burden, adding to concern  Europe ’s fiscal
crisis will deepen. South Africa’s rand and Mexico’s peso led
gains among the 16 major currencies. The yen rose to within 1
yen of a postwar high against the dollar, prompting speculation
 Japan  will intervene to limit the currency’s gains.  “A lot more people are putting on risk by way of the
dollar,” said  Alan Ruskin , global head of Group-of-10 foreign-
exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in New York. “You’ve got
a nice breakdown in dollar-Mexico and dollar-South African rand.
Some of the emerging-market vehicles that have been very popular
trades this year are definitely doing rather well.”  The dollar dropped 0.1 percent to 76.13 yen at 11:03 a.m.
in  New York  and reached 76.05 yen, approaching the postwar
record of 75.35 set on Oct. 31. The greenback fell 0.1 percent
to $1.3175 per euro. The shared currency was little changed at
100.33 yen.  South Africa’s rand rose 0.9 percent to 7.6234 per dollar,
having appreciated 2.2 percent so far this week. Mexico’s peso
added 0.7 percent to 12.7988 per dollar. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index rose 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
