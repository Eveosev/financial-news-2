The ruble appreciated against the
dollar, poised for its strongest close since Oct. 31 after Urals
crude oil,  Russia ’s main export blend, rose to its highest price
in almost three months.  The Russian currency rose 0.2 percent to 30.1747 and was
little changed at 39.7611 per euro and 34.4858 against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket. Investors increased
bets the ruble would weaken, with non-deliverable forwards
showing the Russian currency at 30.5506 per dollar in three
months, compared with expectations of 30.5345 yesterday.  Urals (EUCRURNW)  climbed 0.8 percent to $111.64 by yesterday’s close,
the highest price since Nov. 15. The commodity has risen 5.6
percent in 2012 as threatened supply disruptions from Iran and
 Nigeria  drive up prices.  Russia’s $3.5 billion of bonds due 2018 rose, pushing the
yield down 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 4.003
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
