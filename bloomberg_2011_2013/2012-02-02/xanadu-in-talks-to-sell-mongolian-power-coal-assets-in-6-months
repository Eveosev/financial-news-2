Xanadu Mines Ltd. (XAM) , an Australian
explorer operating in Mongolia, is in talks to sell its thermal
coal assets in the nation in the next six months as part of a
shift to focus on coking coal.  Discussions are being held at an informal stage and no bank
has yet been hired for the sale, Xanadu Chairman Brian Thornton
said today by phone from Sydney, without giving details.  Xanadu formed an alliance with commodity trader  Noble Group
Ltd. (NOBL)  in February last year to develop coking coal,  iron ore  and
ferro alloys opportunities in Mongolia. Xanadu has two wholly
owned thermal coal projects in Mongolia, according to the
company’s website.  “Our focus would be on coking coal assets with Noble, and
our gold and copper assets,” Thornton said. “There’s nothing
concrete on the table yet.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
