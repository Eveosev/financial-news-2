The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment fell,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 3 basis points to 174.5 as of 8:29
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The measure is set for its lowest close since Oct. 28, according
to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index fell 3 basis points to 154.5
as of 9:34 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The index
is on track for its lowest close since Sept. 16., according to
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted
by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index fell 4 basis points to
151 as of 12:09 p.m in Sydney, Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
