India ’s 10-year bonds gained for a
fourth day, extending this year’s gains that have driven yields
to a nine-month low, as the central bank’s plan to purchase debt
shored up demand.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will buy as much as 100 billion
rupees ($2 billion) of fixed-income securities tomorrow, it said
in a statement on Jan. 31. The RBI has bought 719 billion rupees
of notes since November to ease a cash  squeeze  in the banking
system. Lenders’ borrowing from the monetary authority averaged
1.3 trillion rupees this week, more than double the 600 billion
rupees “comfort zone” indicated by the Reserve Bank at its
policy review on Jan. 24.  “Bond purchases are driving yields lower,” said M. Natarajan, head of treasury at Bank of  Nova Scotia  in Mumbai.
“The RBI may have to buy more as the debt supply is huge and
liquidity is tight.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021
declined two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.13
percent in  Mumbai , according to the central bank’s trading
system. That’s the lowest level for a benchmark 10-year note
since April 29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
fell six basis points to 8.08 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
