Redecard SA (RDCD3) ,  Brazil ’s second-largest
card-payment processor by market value, rose to the highest
level in almost two years after the company said cost cuts
helped boost its adjusted net income 31 percent last quarter.  Shares gained 3.1 percent to 32.37 reais at 11:50 a.m. in
Sao Paulo, the highest since April 2010. Cielo SA, Redecard’s
bigger rival, rose 2.5 percent.  Redecard’s adjusted net income, which excludes some items,
increased to 456.9 million reais ($263.7 million), from 348.7
million reais a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing.
The results beat the 402 million reais  mean  estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts.  “The company’s results were stronger than expected on
costs and expenses,” analysts Carlos Firetti, Gustavo Lobo and
Bruno Chemmer from Banco Bradesco BBI wrote in a note to clients
yesterday.  They rate the stock “outperform.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
