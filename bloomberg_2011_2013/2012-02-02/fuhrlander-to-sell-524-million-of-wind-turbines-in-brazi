Fuhrlander AG , a German wind-turbine
maker, expects to sign about 900 million reais ($524 million)
worth of sales contracts in  Brazil  this month as it seeks to
meet the country’s increasing demand for renewable energy.  Turbines with 400 megawatts of total capacity will be
supplied to three developers from a factory Fuhrlander is
building in northeast Brazil, Newton Lima, a project manager for
the company, said today in a telephone interview. Lima said he
couldn’t name the customers until the deals close.  Fuhrlander, based in Waigandshain,  Germany , is building a
manufacturing base in Brazil to supply the growing number of
developers that have signed contracts to sell wind power in
government-organized auctions.  “Brazil is a key country for Fuhrlander,” Lima said.
“The wind market is maturing. Now is the right moment to step
inside.”  The company will begin construction in March on a 20
million-real factory in the city of Pecem that initially will be
able to produce 20 turbines a month, Lima said. The first ones
should be complete in February 2013, he said.  The developers are Fuhrlander’s first customers in Brazil.
They are among the companies that won contracts to sell power in
a December auction. The wind farms must be complete by 2016, he
said.  Fuhrlander plans to sign contracts for an additional 400
megawatts of turbines this year and may build another factory to
meet future demand, Lima said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
