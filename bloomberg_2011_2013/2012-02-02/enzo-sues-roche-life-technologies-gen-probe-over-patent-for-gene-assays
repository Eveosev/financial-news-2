Enzo Life Sciences, which makes
products used to genetically screen for disease, sued rivals
Roche Diagnostics Corp.,  Life Technologies Corp. (LIFE)  and  Gen-Probe
Inc. (GPRO)  claiming infringement of a U.S. patent.  The unit of New York-based  Enzo Biochem (ENZ)  contends Roche, of
Indianapolis; Life, of Carlsbad,  California ; and Gen-Probe, of
 San Diego , are wrongly using gene assays to detect HIV and other
disorders before the 2006 patent expires.  Enzo “has the right to sue and recover damages for any
current or past infringement” of the patent, its lawyers said
in three separate complaints filed Jan. 30 in federal court in
Wilmington, Delaware.  In June, the  U.S. Supreme Court (1000L)  refused to hear an appeal by
Life Technologies, letting Enzo Biochem Inc. press ahead with a
separate patent-infringement suit over a way to detect genetic
sequences and diagnose human diseases, including cancer. The
justices left intact a federal appeals court ruling that revived
two Enzo patents invalidated by a trial court. Life Technologies
and its Applera unit argued unsuccessfully that the patents
weren’t specific enough in their description of the claimed
invention.  Suzanne Clancy, a Life Technologies spokeswoman, declined
to comment on today’s lawsuit. Michael Watts of Gen-Probe didn’t
immediately return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment.  Roche ‘Confident’  “We are reviewing this matter and are confident of our
position,” Robin Snyder, a spokeswoman for Roche, said in an
e-mail. “Beyond that, we are not able to comment on pending
litigation.”  Enzo reported $102 million in sales and a $16 million net
loss for the 12-month period ending Oct. 31, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. For the fiscal year ended July 31, Enzo
had losses of less than $13 million and revenue of $102 million.  Enzo rose 4.1 percent to $2.80 in trading in  New York  at
4:02 p.m. Its shares have fallen about 45 percent in the past
year.  Roche parent  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  of Basel, Switzerland, with
about $48 billion in annual sales, is the world’s biggest maker
of cancer drugs. Its shares fell 40 centimes to 153 Swiss francs
in trading in Switzerland today.  Life Technologies had almost $3.7 billion in revenue for
the year ended Sept. 30.  Gen-Probe, with about $554 million in revenue for the 12
months ended Sept. 30, makes tests for sexually transmitted
diseases and blood screening. Its shares recently have been
trading in the upper $60 range and were raised to the
“outperform” rating by  RBC Capital Markets  last month with a
12-month target of $72 a share.  The cases are Enzo v. Roche, 12-cv-00106; Enzo v. Life
Technologies, 12-cv-00105; and Enzo v. Gen-Probe, 12-cv-00104,
