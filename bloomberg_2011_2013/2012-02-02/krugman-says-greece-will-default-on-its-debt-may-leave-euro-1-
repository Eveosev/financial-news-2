Greece  will default on its debt and
will probably quit the European monetary union, Nobel economics
laureate  Paul Krugman  said.  “The Greek situation is essentially impossible,” Krugman
said at a conference in Moscow today. “They will default on
their debt. In fact they already have. The question is whether
they will also leave the euro, which I think at this point is
more likely than not.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
