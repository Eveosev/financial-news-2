Claims for U.S. jobless benefits fell
last week and productivity cooled in the fourth quarter,
signaling hiring may accelerate as companies reach the limits of
how much efficiency they can wring from existing workforces.  Applications (INJCJC)  for unemployment insurance payments dropped by
12,000 to 367,000 in the week ended Jan. 28, according to Labor
Department figures issued today in  Washington . Worker output per
hour increased at a 0.7 percent annual rate from October through
December, down from a 1.9 percent gain in the prior three
months, another report showed.  After focusing on cutting costs during the recession,
American businesses are taking on more staff as they gain
confidence the recovery will be sustained. In prepared remarks
to Congress today, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
today highlighted improvements in the job market and production,
while cautioning the outlook remains “uncertain.”  “The labor market remains on a modestly improving
trajectory,” said  Richard DeKaser , deputy chief economist at
Parthenon Group Inc. in  Boston , who forecast 368,000 initial
claims. “We are starting to move to the next phase of the labor
market expansion, where hiring will increasingly overshadow
layoffs.”  The drop in firings last week and Bernanke’s acknowledgment
of the improvement helped lift most shares. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.1 percent to 1,325.54 at the close
in  New York .  Drop Projected  The median forecast of 46 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey projected claims would drop to 371,000 from 377,000
initially reported for the prior week. Estimates ranged from
360,000 to 384,000. The Labor Department revised the previous
week’s figure up to 379,000.  A report tomorrow may show employers boosted payrolls in
January by 145,000 workers and the  jobless rate  held at an
almost three-year low of 8.5 percent, according to the Bloomberg
survey median estimates.  “Fortunately, over the past few months indicators of
spending, production, and job market activity have shown some
signs of improvement,” Bernanke said today, according to
prepared testimony before the House Budget Committee. “The
outlook remains uncertain, however, and close monitoring of
economic developments will remain necessary.”  Bernanke spoke a week after the policy-setting  Federal Open
Market Committee  said the outlook for the economy will probably
warrant low  interest rates  through at least late 2014. The FOMC
also committed to capping inflation at 2 percent, achieving
Bernanke’s longstanding goal to reduce “public uncertainty”
and anchor long-run expectations about monetary policy.  Spanish Unemployment  Elsewhere today, Spanish  unemployment  registrations jumped
in January by the most in three years as the economy edged
toward its second recession since the end of 2009, figures from
the Labor Ministry in  Madrid  showed.  Australia’s trade surplus soared to a record in 2011 on
coal and iron ore shipments, a Bureau of Statistics report
showed in Sydney today. The data underscore the  Reserve Bank  of
 Australia ’s expectation that Chinese demand for the nation’s
commodities will help propel the domestic economy even as a
global expansion slows.  The four-week moving average for jobless claims, a less
volatile measure than the weekly figures, fell to 375,750 last
week from 377,750. It was the second-lowest reading since 2008,
bested only by the 374,000 reached in the last week of December.  A Labor Department spokesman said there was nothing unusual
with last week’s data and no states’ data was estimated.  Benefit Rolls  The number of people  continuing  to receive jobless benefits
plunged by 130,000 in the week ended Jan. 21 to 3.44 million,
the fewest since September 2008.  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments increased by about
43,100 to 3.5 million in the week ended Jan. 14.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  An improving job market may be helping underpin household
sentiment. The  Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index (COMFCOMF)  rose to minus
44.8 in the week ended Jan. 29 from minus 46.4 the previous
period. A measure of Americans’ view of the state of economy
climbed to the highest level since June.  The productivity report also showed expenses per employee
climbed at a 1.2 percent rate after falling 2.1 percent in the
third quarter.  Productivity Cools  For all of 2011, productivity rose 0.7 percent, the
smallest annual increase since 2008, when it rose 0.6 percent.
The advance is smaller than the 2.5 percent increase on average
from 2000 to 2010, indicating efficiency gains are getting
harder to come by.  “In order to increase output, businesses, and
manufacturers in particular, are just going to have to bring
more people back,” said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica
Inc. in  Dallas . “They’re not going to get by only on technology
in the short run. This is the backside of all the very robust
productivity gains we had in 2008, 2009.”  Paccar Inc. (PCAR) , the Bellevue, Washington-based maker of
Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks, is among companies seeing the
need to add staff.  Parts suppliers “have been able to feel a little more
confident about hiring people back, maybe taking on a second
shift, investing in some capacity, whatever their particular
need is and just feeling a little bit better and as they go into
2012,” Mark Pigott, chief executive officer of Paccar Inc.,
said in a Jan. 31 conference call.  Paccar said it estimates U.S. and Canadian truck sales will
rise by around 14 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
