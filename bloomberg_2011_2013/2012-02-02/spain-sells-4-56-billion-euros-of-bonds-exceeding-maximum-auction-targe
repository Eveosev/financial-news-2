France  and  Spain  sold 12.5 billion
euros ($16.4 billion) of bonds, with borrowing costs falling
in the latest sign the  European Central Bank ’s increased lending
is stoking investor appetite for the region’s debt.  France sold 7.96 billion euros of six- eight- and 10-year
debt at the top of its planned range. Spain sold 4.56 billion
euros of bonds maturing in 2015, 2016 and 2017, just above its
target for the sale.  The ECB’s three-year lending program, dubbed LTRO, is
underpinning demand for the region’s sovereign debt even as
policy makers struggle to forge an agreement on a second bailout
for  Greece . The Greek government needs to reach a deal and
secure a second European Union-led bailout by March 20, when it
faces a 14.5 billion-euro bond payment.  “The psychological boost provided by the LTRO appears to
have allayed some of the fears stemming from the perceived
consequences of a Greek default,” said Nicholas Spiro, of Spiro
Sovereign Strategy in  London .  Demand for France’s benchmark 10-year bond was 1.71 times
the amount sold, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.64 on
Jan. 5, said Agence France Tresor, the country’s debt-management
body. For Spain’s 2015 notes, demand was 1.63 times the amount
sold, compared with 1.8 times the last time they were sold in
January. It rose to 3.57 from 3.24 on the 2016 notes.  Sale Details  France sold 5.698 billion euros of debt maturing in April
2022 at an average yield of 3.13 percent, less than the 3.29
percent for the bond due October 2021 at the previous sale on
Jan. 5. France also sold six and eight-year debt, with yields
falling on all maturities.  The average yield on the Spanish 2016 bonds was 3.455,
compared with 4.021 percent at the Jan. 19 auction and 3.527
percent on the secondary market before the sale.  The ECB program is “a positive among a number of positives
and negatives,” said  Padhraic Garvey , head of developed market
debt at ING Bank NV in Amsterdam. “We’re going through a period
of risk-on.”  ECB President  Mario Draghi  announced the three-year-loans
program in December. A similar offer will be made on Feb. 28.  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said on Jan.
30 that the extraordinary facility was “useful” for Spain’s
sovereign debt, after Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA
Chairman Francisco Gonzalez said longer-term ECB lending would
allow banks to buy more public debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
