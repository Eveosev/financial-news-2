Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s
biggest oil company, expects to raise its dividend this year for
the first time since 2009 as new projects generate more cash.  Shell plans net capital investment of $30 billion, with
cashflow from operations in 2012-2015 expected to be as much as
50 percent higher than in the 2008 to 2011 period.  Chief Executive Officer  Peter Voser  said growth will be
driven by more than 60 new projects, unlocking potential
resources of more than 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
That’s on top of 14 projects started in 2009-2011, including
Qatar’s Pearl gas-to-liquids venture.  “Our improving financial position creates an opportunity
to increase both our dividends and investment levels,” Voser
said today in a statement.  Net  income  fell to $6.5 billion in the fourth quarter from
$6.79 billion a year earlier, The Hague-based Shell said.
Excluding one-time items and inventory changes, profit missed
analyst estimates.  The Anglo-Dutch company plans to increase the dividend by
2.4 percent to 43 cents in the first quarter from 42 cents
announced in the fourth quarter.  Shell is the first of Europe’s biggest oil companies to
report earnings. It will be followed by BP Plc on Feb. 7 and
Total SA on Feb. 10.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the world’s largest
energy company by market value, reported fourth-quarter sales
that fell short of analysts’ estimates earlier this week.  Shell posted adjusted earnings of $4.8 billion, compared
with the $5.2 billion median  estimate  of 15 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  ‘Substantial Undershoot’  “The overall result represents a substantial undershoot
against a consensus which just three weeks ago was above $7
billion,” said Stuart Joyner, an analyst at Investec.  Shell fell 0.2 percent to 2,265 pence in London. The shares
climbed 11 percent last year.  U.K. front-month natural gas prices are down about 20
percent since reaching a 2011 high of 67.80 pence per therm on
Nov. 7. Milder weather in  Europe  and maintenance curbed Shell’s
production by about 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the
quarter, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  Shell will increase production to about 4 million barrels
of oil equivalent a day in 2017-2018. Last March, it said daily
output would rise to 3.5 million barrels this year and 3.7
million barrels by 2014.  Exploration Boost  Output fell 5.5 percent to 3.305 million barrels a day in
the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period. Full-year
production declined 3 percent to 3.215 million barrels a day
last year.  The company plans to increase investment in exploration by
35 percent to about $5 billion this year, after raising spending
30 percent to $3.6 billion last year, it said.  Profit was also curbed by maintenance at rigs in the  Gulf
of Mexico  and the  North Sea . Shell shut the Bonga field in
 Nigeria  after an offshore  oil spill , the nation’s worst in more
than a decade.  A fire disrupted shipments from Shell’s Pulau Bukom plant
in  Singapore , the company’s biggest. The company had a charge of
$150 million in the fourth quarter relating to the fire, Voser
said.  Refinery Results  Shell made a loss of $278 million from its refining and
marketing operations, compared with a profit of $482 million a
year earlier. Crude processing fell 17 percent as sales dropped.  “We had the perfect storm,” Voser told analysts today.
“After the driving season, the demand just collapsed both in
the U.S. but also in Europe.”  Refining margins from processing oil into fuels such as
gasoline and diesel on the U.S. Gulf coast fell 22 percent to
$7.16 a barrel in the fourth quarter from a year earlier,
according to  BP Plc (BP/)   data .  Shell divested about $7.5 billion in assets last year,
including the sale of its 80 percent interest in Pecten Cameroon
Co for $500 million to a unit of  China Petrochemical Corp (SINZ) . The
company expects to dispose producing assets with capacity of
about 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day between 2012 and
2017, it said today.  Shell is advancing its floating liquefied natural gas
technology and has agreed to pay about $900 million to  Inpex
Corp. (1605)  to join Indonesia’s Abadi offshore field development
project last year. It spent about $700 million on new
exploration acreage acquisitions in  Russia ’s Arctic,  Turkey ,
 Canada , Colombia and the U.S. in the fourth quarter.  Last year, Shell signed liquefied natural gas supply
agreements worth about $100 billion valued at today’s oil price,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
