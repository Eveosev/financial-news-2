India is disappointed with a forecast
of 7 percent economic growth this year, as it had hoped for 8.5
percent, Trade Minister  Anand Sharma  said in an interview with
France’s Le Figaro newspaper.  “We are victims of the rise in raw materials prices,
notably oil, on which we are very dependent,” he said in the
interview. “But our economic fundamentals are good.”  Concerning the European debt crisis, Sharma told the
newspaper that it has an impact on all countries. In response to
any request for help from the  International Monetary Fund ,
Sharma said that India would “cooperate as partners do.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
