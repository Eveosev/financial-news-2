OAO RusHydro (RSHYY) ,  Russia ’s largest
hydropower producer, fell in U.S. trading on concern colder
weather will reduce electricity production and as Deutsche Bank
AG cut its target price for the company’s stock.  RusHydro’s  American depositary receipts  dropped 1.5 percent
to $3.91 in New York, paring their 29 percent advance this year.  “The company’s production is expected to decline as frosts
have arrived,” analyst Dmitry Bulgakov at Deutsche Bank in
Moscow said by phone. “You can’t cheat Mother Nature, water
freezes when temperature drops that much.”  Temperatures in Moscow fell to minus 25 degrees Celsius
(minus 13 Fahrenheit) yesterday and was expected to be as low as
minus 50 Celsius in Russia’s Magadan region, according to
 Russia’s Hydrometeorological Center . The company’s stock in
Moscow fell 0.2 percent to 1.1687 rubles. One depositary receipt
is equal to 100 ordinary shares.  Deutsche Bank cut its 12-month target price for RusHydro’s
Moscow-listed  stock  by 9 percent to 1.31 rubles. The bank
reiterated its “buy” recommendation on the stock, adding that
“the main downside risk is an escalation of investment costs,”
analysts led by Bulgakov said in an e-mailed report.  The company plans to invest 103.6 billion rubles, or $3.4
billion, for technical upgrades of its existing power plants and
construction of new projects throughout the country in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
