The following companies had unusual

parentheses and prices are as of the close.  The  Ipsa (IPSA)  index rose 0.5 percent to 4,338.37. The  MSCI Chile (MXCL) 
index gained 1.9 percent to 2,531.77.  Banco Santander Chile (BSAN)  (BSAN CC) dropped 4.1 percent to
36.65 pesos. The country’s biggest bank by assets will
prioritize profitability over market share gains this year as
proposed lending restrictions and inflation threaten to narrow

a conference call today.  Colbun SA (COLBUN)   fell the most in two weeks, losing
1.1 percent to 127.83 pesos. The electricity generator’s fourth-
quarter profit of $32.3 million, reported after the close of

forecast.  Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA  (ENDESA CC) gained 1.8
percent to 789.43 pesos. Chile’s largest power generator has
increased 4.1 percent in the two days since reporting fourth-
quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
