Sky Deutschland AG (SKYD) , the German pay-
television provider controlled by  News Corp. (NWSA) , climbed as much as
14 percent in Frankfurt after subscriber numbers rose and the
company predicted positive earnings in 2013.  Sky Deutschland jumped as much as 26 cents to 2.16 euros,
the highest intraday price since Nov. 14. The company, based in
Unterfoehring near Munich, forecast positive earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2013. While
this year’s result will probably be negative on that basis, one
or two quarters may be profitable, Chief Executive Officer Brian Sullivan said on a conference call today.  Subscribers rose to 3 million by the end of the fourth
quarter from 2.65 million a year earlier, helped by sales with
high-definition channels and the Sky+ video recorder, the
company said in a statement. The 3 million customers figure is a
condition for breaking even, it said previously.  “We are absolutely seeing the positive effect of what
we’ve been doing,” Sullivan said on the call. “That’s why
we’re going to continue investing in developing the platform and
that’s why we’re putting the extra money into the business in
order to be able to do that on an ongoing basis.”  The shares traded 7.8 percent higher at 2.04 euros as of
10:22 a.m. in  Frankfurt .  Sky Deutschland, 49.9 percent-owned by News Corp., also
announced plans to raise 300 million euros ($395 million) by the
end of September to invest in growth. The funds, “fully
backstopped by News Corp.,” will be raised in two steps through
share sales, shareholder loans or a combination of the measures
to help pay for expansion.  The loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization for 2011 was 155 million euros, compared with a 159
million-euro average loss estimate in a Bloomberg analyst
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
