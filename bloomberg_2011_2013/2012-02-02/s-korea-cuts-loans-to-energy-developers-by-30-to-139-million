South Korea , which imports almost all
of its oil needs, reduced the amount it plans to lend energy
developers to support investments in crude and natural gas
fields to 156 billion won ($139 million) this year.  The allocation is 30 percent less than last year after
lawmakers cut the government budget for energy and resource
development in 2012 by a third to 200 billion won, Kim Seung
Tae, deputy director at the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy , said
at a seminar today in Seoul. The remaining 44 billion won will
be lent to resource developers, he said.  The loans will carry lower  interest rates  and principal
payments will be waived if exploration efforts fail, he said.  South Korea plans to increase investments by 34 percent to
$11.8 billion in 2012 to develop overseas oil and gas fields as
it seeks to reduce reliance on energy imports. Investments by
South Korean companies in overseas energy assets almost tripled
to $6.45 billion in 2010 from $2.23 billion in 2007, according
to  government data , while the stateâ€™s funding support ratio
declined to 3 percent from 17 percent in the period.  South Korea plans to own crude and gas assets capable of
producing 20 percent of its overall energy consumption this
year, compared with an estimated 13.8 percent in 2011, according
to data from the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
