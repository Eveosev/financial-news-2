Euro-area officials signed the treaty
to create a permanent aid fund on July 1, trying to jump-start
the ratification process and prevent a delay due to  France ’s
elections in April.  They also renewed a pledge to reassess a 500 billion-euro
($658 billion) ceiling on overall rescue lending in March.  The European Stability Mechanism treaty will go to national
governments for ratification after a signing ceremony in
Brussels today, the European Union said. The goal is for it to
become operational on July 1, a year earlier than previously
planned.  “This permanent crisis mechanism will contribute to
raising confidence and ensuring solidarity and financial
stability in the euro area,” EU President  Herman Van Rompuy 
said in an e-mailed statement.  France’s parliament provisionally scheduled a debate on
Feb. 21 to vote on the ESM and on the treaty modification its
implementation requires.  The fiscal compact endorsed by 25 EU countries at the Jan.
30 summit that completed the ESM treaty won’t be considered
before France’s May presidential elections and June legislative
elections, French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said after the
summit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
