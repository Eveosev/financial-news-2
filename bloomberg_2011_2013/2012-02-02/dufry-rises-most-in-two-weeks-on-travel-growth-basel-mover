Dufry AG (DUFN) , the operator of Hudson News
stores in airports, rose the most in two weeks in Zurich trading
after ING analysts said rising airline passenger traffic and
increased retail space will boost revenue.  Dufry rose as much as 8.1 Swiss francs, or 7.5 percent, to
116.4 francs. That’s the biggest intraday gain since Jan. 17.
The stock was up 3.5 percent at 10:13 a.m. and has gained 29
percent this year, making it the fourth-best performing stock in
the 218-member Swiss Performance Index.  So-called organic sales may rise 11 percent annually
between 2011 and 2015, while net income may increase 20 percent
during the same period, ING Groep NV analysts John David Roeg
and Jan Meijer wrote in a research note published yesterday.
Acquisitions may add to the gains, the analysts said. They
initiated coverage of Dufry with a “buy”  recommendation .  “Dufry’s growth strategy is focused on emerging markets
and tourist destinations,” the analysts wrote. “These
locations offer higher sales and profit growth due to a
combination of higher airline-passenger traffic growth and lower
concession fees.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
