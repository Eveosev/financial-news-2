Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , the biggest U.S.
chemical maker, said demand is improving in the current quarter
in the U.S. and Asia, particularly for materials used in
electronics and autos.  “Order books are looking good for January,”  Andrew Liveris , chief executive officer of the Midland, Michigan-based
company, said today in a telephone interview. “Asia is coming
back.”  Liveris said demand fell in October and November as
customers used up inventories before rebounding in December. The
improved demand has continued into 2012, led by emerging markets
and the U.S., he said.  “The U.S. is looking decent because of things like auto,”
Liveris said. “We sees signs of electronics coming back because
of all the things we use -- smartphones, tablets -- in February
and March.”  Europe  will continue to be a drag on earnings through 2012,
he said.  “We will see a decent global economy this year,” Liveris
said. “Europe will be the one that is continually in our
face.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
