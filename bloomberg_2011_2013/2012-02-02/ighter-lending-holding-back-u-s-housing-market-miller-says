The U.S. real estate market would be
expanding if lending standards were more balanced and credit
more available, according to  Jonathan Miller  of Miller Samuel
Inc.  “We would probably have a housing boom with the rates that
mortgage levels are at,” Miller, president and chief executive
of New York-based appraiser Miller Samuel Inc., said during
Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance Midday,” with Tom Keene.  Rates (NMCMFUS)  for 30-year U.S. mortgages have declined to 3.87
percent, the lowest in records dating to 1971, mortgage buyer
 Freddie Mac  said today in a statement. While the  Federal Reserve 
has helped lower borrowing costs by holding short-term  interest
rates  near zero since 2008 and buying mortgage bonds, home loan
borrowing is forecast to drop in 2012 to the least in 15 years.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke cited tightened lending
standards last month in a paper sent to Congress as an obstacle
to a housing and broader economy recovery. President  Barack Obama  said yesterday he will ask Congress for legislation to
clear barriers to help more homeowners refinance into lower-rate
loans.  The housing market also is being held back by mounting
foreclosures, which are expected to rise above 2011 levels and
push  home prices  lower in the coming year, according to a report
from Irvine, California-based data firm RealtyTrac Inc. About
1.9 million homes were hit with foreclosure actions last year,
the firm reported.  Miller forecasts “heavy foreclosure” volume over the next
three years, with 1 million units being seized this year. Until
inventory is cleared out, there won’t be a recovery, Miller
said.  “The sooner you get it over with, the better we are in the
long run,” Miller said.
