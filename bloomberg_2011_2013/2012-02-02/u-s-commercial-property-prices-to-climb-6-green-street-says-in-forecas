Commercial-property values in the
U.S. probably will climb about 6 percent in the next six months,
based on recent  trading  in real estate investment trusts and
fixed-income yields,  Green Street Advisors Inc.  said.  “The increased optimism being expressed by REIT investors
and the decreased skittishness evidenced in the high-yield
market should eventually find their way into property
valuations,” the  Newport Beach , California-based research firm
said today in a report introducing its Commercial Property Price
Forecast. “That’s a notable improvement over the outlook a few
months back.”  Property values were little changed during the past several
months after a two-year rally that brought them to within 10
percent of record highs reached in 2007, Green Street said in a
Jan. 6 report on its Commercial Property Price Index.  Apartment values have been the strongest, while office and
lodging properties are still below their past highs, the firm
said last month. Office buildings in  Manhattan , the largest U.S.
market for such properties, are 20 percent below their prior
peak, according to Green Street.  To contact the reporter on this story:
