(Corrects spelling of Caesars in headline.)  A unit of  Caesars Entertainment Corp. (HET) 
is seeking to push out the maturity on as much as $4 billion of
term loans to January 2018 from January 2015 and plans to
increase the  interest rate  on the extended debt.  Caesars Entertainment Operating Co. also plans to raise
$1.25 billion of senior-secured debt and use as much as $1
billion of that to repay a portion of its outstanding term
loans, the Las Vegas-based company said today in a regulatory
filing.  The unit of Caesars, the casino company with $19.6 billion
of long-term debt as of Sept. 30, also seeks to convert
revolving credit commitments to extended term loans and extend
the maturity of non-converted revolving commitments to January
2017 from January 2014, according to the filing.  The new debt would have a later maturity and a higher
interest rate than the  debt  being repaid, the company said.  In a revolving credit, money can be borrowed again once
it’s repaid; in a  term loan , it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
