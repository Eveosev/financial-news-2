Dominic Lester, joint head of
European investment banking at New York-based securities firm
 Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , said the acquisition of Hoare Govett from
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  will help the firm increase its
market share in U.K. equities.  “In the U.K. you need a corporate broking platform to be
relevant, particularly in  equity capital markets ,” Lester said
in a telephone interview yesterday. “We grew the business
organically, but given the opportunity to take 50-plus clients
and an established brand in one fell swoop was appealing.”  Jefferies, which focuses on the mid market, bought the
business for a “nominal sum,” RBS said in a statement
yesterday. About 50 employees will join Jefferies’s London
office, including all of Hoare Govett’s corporate broking team.  “The businesses are complementary and we surgically
structured the deal in a manner that provides maximum upside and
minimum downside,” Lester said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
