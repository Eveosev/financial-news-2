Hungarian voters’ perception of the
government’s work improved in January by three percentage
points, to 33 percent, while support for the major political
parties was little changed, the weekly  HVG  reported, citing a
poll by Median.  Support for the ruling Fidesz party stood at 26 percent
among eligible voters, while backing for the Socialists, the
main opposition party, was 15 percent, the poll indicated.
Jobbik, a radical opposition party, commanded 10 percent support
and the green Lehet Mas a Politika had 4 percent.  Seventy-three percent of voters said Hungary is going in
the wrong direction and only 41 percent said they would vote,
according to HVG. The survey was conducted from Jan. 20 to
Jan. 24; the weekly didn’t provide a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
