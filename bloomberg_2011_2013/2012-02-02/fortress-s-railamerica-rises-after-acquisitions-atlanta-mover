RailAmerica Inc. (RA) , the short-line
railroad operator controlled by  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) ,
rose the most in almost four months after announcing two
acquisitions.  The company said in statements late yesterday it agreed to
buy regional carrier Marquette Rail LLC for $40 million and will
pay $18 million for a 70 percent stake in Myles Group’s
Wellsboro & Corning Railroad and Industrial Waste Group.  “RA’s two new acquisitions are a positive,” positioning
the carrier to benefit from Wellsboro & Corning traffic
supporting the Marcellus Shale natural gas industry, Jason Seidl, a Dahlman Rose & Co. analyst in New York, said today in a
note to investors. He recommends holding RailAmerica shares.  RailAmerica, based in Jacksonville,  Florida , climbed 9.5
percent to $16.64 at 9:51 a.m. in New York, the biggest intraday
advance since Oct. 4. Fortress, based in New York, holds a 59
percent stake in RailAmerica, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
