A study into mine nationalization
commissioned by  South Africa ’s ruling  African National Congress 
has recommended increasing taxes on mining companies rather than
taking over the operations, a party official who has seen the
document said.  The study is due to be discussed in a five-day meeting of
the party’s decision-making body that began today, he said,
declining to be identified because the document has not been
released publicly. The ANC instituted the study after its youth
wing leader,  Julius Malema , proposed that the government take
over the country’s mines and banks because the black majority
isn’t deriving enough benefit from them.  South Africa is the world’s biggest producer of platinum,
chrome and manganese and supplies coal to power plants in Europe
and  India . In April 2010 Citigroup Inc. valued the country’s
mineral resources at $2.5 trillion, the most of any nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
