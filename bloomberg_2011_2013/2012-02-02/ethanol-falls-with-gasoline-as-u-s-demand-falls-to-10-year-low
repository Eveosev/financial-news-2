Ethanol fell along with gasoline for
the first time in three days after the Energy Department
reported U.S. demand for the motor fuel reached a 10-year low.  Prices retreated a day after the government reported
gasoline supplied to wholesalers sank 1.6 percent last week to
the lowest level since September 2001. U.S. ethanol output rose
0.5 percent in the first advance this year. Temperatures in  New
York  City reached 62 degrees Fahrenheit (17 Celsius) yesterday,
23 degrees above normal.  “A mild winter and high prices are curbing demand for
gasoline,” Daniel Flynn, a trader at PFG Best in  Chicago , said
