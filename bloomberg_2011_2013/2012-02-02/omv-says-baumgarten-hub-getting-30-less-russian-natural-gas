OMV AG (OMV) , central Europe’s biggest oil
company, said its Baumgarten natural gas hub is getting 30
percent less gas than yesterday from  Russia .  “Due to the severe winter in Russia, and temperatures of
up to minus 35 Celsius, the delivery of natural gas from Russia
is currently restricted,” OMV said in a statement today.  OMV said Austria’s gas needs can be fully met with domestic
gas and its “strategic” storage facilities, which have a
capacity of 2.4 billion cubic meters of gas, according to the
statement.  Austria’s annual natural gas consumption is about 9 billion
cubic meters, OMV said. About 47 percent of the country’s
natural gas comes from Russia, 38 percent from  Norway  and other
countries, and about 15 percent from domestic production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
