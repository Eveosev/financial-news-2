China’s real-estate companies should
take advantage of demand for property bonds in 2012 by selling
dollar-denominated notes, according to Bank of America Corp.  Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. (3333) ,  Country Garden Holdings
Co. (2007) , and  Agile Property Holdings Ltd. (3383)  should use a recent rally
to issue bonds and refinance debt due in the three years from
2014, Alwyn Pang, a research analyst at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, said in a note to clients yesterday. China corporate
bonds outperformed the rest of Asia in 2012, and returned 5.4
percent, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co’s Asia Credit Index.  “Given the strength of the rally, the possibility of new
supply has changed from remote to genuine,” said Pang, who is
based in Hong Kong. “Given the heavy offshore bond redemption
schedule in the sector beginning from the first half of 2014, we
believe new supply from existing larger Chinese property
developers is becoming a possibility.”  Chinese corporate bonds rallied this year as fourth-quarter
 economic growth  and  manufacturing  last month exceeded
expectations. Companies in the world’s second-largest economy
sold $12 billion of notes in 2011, triple the $3.95 billion in
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  About $12.7 billion of debt, including convertible and
synthetic bonds, will mature from 2014 to the end of 2016,
according to Bank of America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
