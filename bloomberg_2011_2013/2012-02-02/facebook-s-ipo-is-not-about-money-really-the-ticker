The whole purpose of an IPO is to raise money. So why, in their SEC filings announcing their IPOs, are so many tech companies so insistent that they're not about money? Facebook, for example, which filed its S-1 with the SEC yesterday, was "not originally created to be a company," writes founder and CEO  Mark Zuckerberg  in a letter to investors (page 67 of  the prospectus , if you're following along at home). "It was built to accomplish a social mission -- to make the world more open and connected." Such high-mindedness is not uncommon.  Andrew Mason , founder and CEO of Groupon, wrote in  his IPO letter  last June that he was in part motivated by a desire "to empower the little guy and solve the world's unsolvable problems." From this an online coupon-clipping service was born. The Ur-we're-not-in-this-for-the-money letter, of course, came from  Sergey Brin  and  Larry Page  of Google, who memorably installed " Donâ€™t Be Evil " as a corporate motto in 2004. As many have  pointed out , that's easier said than done. There's nothing wrong with lofty ambitions. It also makes sense that a company would put its most idealistic foot forward just before it asks the public to invest in it. And Zuckerberg, Mason, Brin, Page and other tech (and non-tech) moguls may honestly believe they are working to make the world a better place. In some cases they may even be justified. But admiration for having ideals can quickly turn into resentment for failing to live up to them. Especially once a company goes public, it may have more pressing concerns than, say, "a more honest and transparent dialogue around government that could lead to more direct empowerment of people, more accountability for officials and better solutions to some of the biggest problems of our time." Better to underpromise and overdeliver than the other way around, particularly when you're still having trouble getting those privacy settings just right. Almost 15 years ago, when the dot-com bubble was still inflating, another well-known company filed its S-1 with the SEC. It contained no letter from the founder. There was no grand statement of higher purpose. "Amazon.com was founded to capitalize on the opportunity for online book retailing," read  its prospectus , with admirable simplicity. Sometimes a little modesty goes a long way. (Michael Newman is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.)
