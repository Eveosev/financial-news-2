Peruvian bonds gained after consumer
prices fell the most in 15 months, spurring speculation the
central bank will cut  interest rates  to bolster the economy.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bonds due August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.66 percent at 1:10 p.m. in  Lima ,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest
yield since Dec. 2. The security’s price gained 0.08 centimo to
114.54 centimos per sol.  Peruvian consumer prices fell 0.1 percent last month, the
most since October 2010, as food costs declined, the government
said yesterday.  “The central bank is probably evaluating more earnestly a
cut in rates, although there’s nothing imminent,” said Manuel Aldave, head of investments at Banco Internacional del  Peru  in
Lima. “The inflation data reinforces the view that the bank
will probably lower rates” by as much as 75 basis points this
year, he said.  Central bankers are scheduled to next meet to set interest
rates on Feb. 9. They kept the benchmark rate at 4.25 percent
for an eighth straight month on Jan. 12.  The sol was little changed at 2.6890 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.6895 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
