The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments declined five basis points to 321 basis points at 8
a.m. in London, the lowest since Dec. 5. A decline signals
improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased five
basis points to 580, the lowest since Aug. 8, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell one basis point to 135.5 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers decreased 2.5 basis points to 207 and
the subordinated index dropped four to 358.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
