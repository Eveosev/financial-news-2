Cash flows of  China ’s listed  property
companies  may drop below 2008 lows, when home sales fell for the
first time since people were allowed to own houses, according to
CEBM Group Ltd., a Shanghai-based investment advisory firm.  The cash crunch will intensify this quarter, as home sales
fall and many loans taken out in 2009 mature, CEBM said in a
report on Jan. 18. The research provider surveyed 131 developers
listed in China.  House values fell for a fifth month in January, according
to SouFun Holdings Ltd., as Premier  Wen Jiabao  reiterated that
the government will maintain curbs to bring prices down. The
0.18 percent monthly decline marks the longest losing streak
since the nation’s biggest real-estate website owner started
tracking the data, it said yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
