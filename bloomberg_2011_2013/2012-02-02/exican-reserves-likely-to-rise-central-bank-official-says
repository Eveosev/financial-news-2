Mexico’s record level of
 international reserves  is likely to increase further, said
Javier Duclaud, the central bank’s general director of market
operations.  The nation’s reserves, which rose $4.9 billion in the first
four weeks of 2012 to a record $147.4 billion, have gained
almost 30 percent since the end of 2010. A majority of the jump,
including $4 billion this year, is the result of dollars coming
in from state-owned oil company  Petroleos Mexicanos , Duclaud
said.  “My guess would be that reserves are probably going to
continue to increase,” he said in a phone interview today from
Mexico City. He declined to speculate on whether the amount
coming from Pemex would increase from 2011.  Pemex was responsible for $19.5 billion of the $28.9
billion increase in reserves in 2011, he said today in a
telephone interview.  “The rates at which the government finances itself in
pesos and in U.S. dollars are obviously going to take into
consideration the amount of reserves that we hold,” Duclaud
said.  The yields on Mexican government dollar bonds due in 2020
have fallen 124 basis points, or 1.24 percentage point, to 3.16
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on
 Mexico ’s peso-denominated bonds due in 2024 dropped 139 basis
points, or 1.39 percentage point, to 6.18 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
