Chile’s peso gained the most in two
months as mining companies in the biggest copper-producing
nation sold dollars to meet liabilities and the dollar fell
against the majority of its most-traded counterparts.  The peso strengthened 1.4 percent to 480.15 per  U.S. dollar 
from 487.04 yesterday, the biggest advance since Nov.30.  Thursday is the best day to hold Chilean pesos as mining
companies tend to sell dollars they get for exports to raise
pesos to meet paychecks. In the four years through today, the
peso strengthened on average 0.12 percent on Thursdays and
depreciated on the other four days, according Bloomberg
calculations. The dollar weakened as stocks and growth-linked
currencies rose, boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  “There’s very little flow but there are mining companies
selling dollars, as they always do,” said Cristian Donoso, a
trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “This
week there has been a drought of corporate flows as managers are
on vacation and decisions aren’t being taken. Every Thursday
mining companies sell dollars, but the other companies that
would maybe buy are absent this week.”  As of 11:29 a.m., $802 million had traded in the Chilean
peso market, according to data from the electronic stock
exchange. Last year an average of $1.3 billion changed hands a
day on 251 trading days, according to exchange data.  Offshore investors raised their bets against the peso in
the forwards market to $4.2 billion on Jan. 31 from a 12-week
low of $4.1 billion on Jan. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
