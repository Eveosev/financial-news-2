Petrodar Operating Co., an oil-
pipeline operator in  Sudan , said it has reported production
volumes to  South Sudan ’s government “accurately and
transparently” since beginning output in 2006.  South Sudanese Oil Minister Stephen Dhieu Dau said on Jan.
27 his government would investigate whether Petrodar had under-
reported output by 40,000 barrels per day.  “We have always operated in a professional and ethical
manner in line with international standards and will continue to
do so in future,” Petrodar said in an e-mailed statement today
from Juba, South Sudan’s capital.  British Virgin Islands-registered Petrodar’s shareholders
include state-owned China National Petroleum Corp., Malaysia’s
Petroliam Nasional Bhd and the government-controlled Sudan
Petroleum Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
