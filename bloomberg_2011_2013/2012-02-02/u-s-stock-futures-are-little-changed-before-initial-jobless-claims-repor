U.S. stocks swung between gains and
losses as Merck & Co. led drugmakers lower after sales trailed
forecasts and investors awaited tomorrow’s employment report to
gauge the outlook for the economy.  Merck, the second-largest U.S. drugmaker, slumped 1.2
percent.  Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF) , the teen apparel chain,
tumbled 12 percent as its preliminary earnings missed analysts’
forecasts.  MasterCard Inc. (MA) , the second-largest payments network,
jumped 5.4 percent as profit climbed 24 percent.  Gap Inc. (GPS)  surged
9.3 percent after the biggest U.S. specialty apparel chain
forecast earnings that  beat  estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.2 percent to
1,321.96 at 12:39 p.m.  New York  time, after rising as much as
0.4 percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 36.21
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,680.25.  “We’ll probably continue with a modest amount of  job
creation ,” Matthew DiFilippo, who helps manage $1 billion as
chief portfolio strategist at Stewart Capital in  Indiana ,
 Pennsylvania , said in a telephone interview. “The earnings
season hasn’t been that positive, but it hasn’t necessarily been
negative either.”  A report tomorrow may show that employment grew by 145,000
after rising by 200,000 in December, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The jobless
rate may have held at an almost three-year low of 8.5 percent.
Earlier today, Labor Department figures showed applications for
unemployment insurance payments dropped by 12,000 to 367,000 in
the week ended Jan. 28. The median forecast of 46 economists in
a Bloomberg News survey projected 371,000.  Earnings Season  Earnings  beat  projections at 67 percent of the 246
companies in the  S&P 500  that reported results since Jan. 9,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 is trading
for about 13.8 times its companies’ earnings and has been stuck
below its  five-decade  average multiple of 16.4 since May 2010,
the longest stretch since a 13-year period beginning in 1973.  “It’s a great time to be placing your bets, seeding your
garden, because we’re fixing the problems,”  John Manley , chief
equity strategist for Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in New York,
said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees $211.5 billion.
“If you believe the  U.S. economy  is going to get better, you
want to own stocks.”  Merck lost 1.2 percent to $38.15. Revenue rose 1.7 percent
to $12.3 billion, less than the analyst estimates of $12.5
billion.  Abercrombie & Fitch tumbled 12 percent to $41.31. The  teen 
apparel chain reported preliminary fourth-quarter earnings that
 trailed  analysts’ estimates as holiday promotions narrowed
profit margins.  MasterCard Rallies  MasterCard advanced 5.4 percent to $377.03. The results cap
a year in which the company, led by Chief Executive Officer  Ajay
Banga , surged 66 percent. The firm repurchased stock as the
global shift from cash and checks to electronic payments
continued. New U.S. regulations on swipe fees charged to
merchants for debit-card purchases also may help Banga wrest
market share from larger rival Visa Inc.  The S&P 500 Diversified Financials Index jumped 0.7
percent, following gains in  Europe ’s lenders. European Union
Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said he
expects a debt-swap agreement between  Greece  and its private
bondholders “by the end of this week.”  Citigroup rose 1.3 percent to $31.99.  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
advanced 0.8 percent to $19.54.  Gap rallied 9.3 percent, the  biggest gain  in the S&P 500,
to $21.27. The company forecast fourth-quarter earnings to be at
least 41 cents a share, exceeding the 35-cent estimate by
analysts on average.  K-Cups  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)  surged 22 percent to
$65.19. The maker of Keurig brand single-cup pods and brewers
reported profit that beat analysts’ estimates as  sales  rose.  “A positive attitude toward equity investing is now in
order” because U.S. bank stocks are doing relatively well and
volatility is fading, according to Donald Coxe, a strategy
adviser to Bank of Montreal.  Coxe recommended that U.S. pension funds lift holdings of
domestic stocks by 6 percentage points, to 20 percent of assets.
The Chicago-based strategist also called for a 2-point increase
in dividend-paying shares, to 12 percent.  KBW Inc.’s regional-bank gauge jumped 37 percent from Sept.
21, when its ratio reached last year’s low, through yesterday.
The S&P 500 rose 13 percent during the same period. Similarly,
the  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  gained more than twice as much as the S&P 500
during the past two months.  “It is good for the stock market that they are thriving,”
Coxe wrote in his report, dated Jan. 27. He added that the  VIX (VIX) ,
the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, signals the
market “isn’t skating on a pond whose ice is about to crack.”  The VIX has closed below 20 for the past 10 trading days,
the longest streak since June. When stocks slumped last August,
the index rose as high as 48.  To contact the reporter on this story:
