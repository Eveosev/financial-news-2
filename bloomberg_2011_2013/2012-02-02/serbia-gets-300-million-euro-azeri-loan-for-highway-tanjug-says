Azerbaijan  will lend 300 million
euros ($394 million) to  Serbia  for building a 39 kilometer (25
mile) section of a new highway, Tanjug news agency reported,
citing Serbia’s Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic.  The 15-year loan has a 4 percent annual interest rate and a
three-year grace period, Jeremic was reported as saying after
signing the agreement with Azerbaijan’s Economy Minister Shahin Mustafayev in Baku today.  The section between western the towns of Ljig and Preljine
will have 60 bridges and five tunnels, the report quoted Jeremic
as saying. It is part of a planned  highway link  between Serbia’s
capital Belgrade and Montenegro on the Adriatic coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
