IRC Ltd. (1029) , a Hong Kong-listed
affiliate of gold miner  Petropavlovsk Plc (POG) , seeks to add Russian
iron ore customers to diversify from Chinese sales, said founder
Pavel Maslovskiy.  “We are avoiding off-take agreements with Chinese
companies in order not to tie ourselves to a single customer,”
Maslovskiy, an emeritus director at IRC, said in an interview in
Moscow. “We want our product to be used in Russia and are in
talks with steelmaker Amurmetall.”  Amurmetall, the only steelmaker in Russia’s Far East,
produces steel from scrap and is upgrading its facilities with
funds from VEB, the state development bank, according to the
 company’s website . The upgrade will allow the steelmaker to use
iron ore concentrate or direct reduced iron, buying 1 to 2
million metric tons of product a year from IRC, Maslovskiy said.  IRC, which operates mines in Russia’s eastern Amur region
near the border with  China , produced more than 800,000 tons of
 iron ore  last year. The company targets fivefold production
growth to about 4.5 million tons in 2014 after starting its
flagship K&S mine at the end of next year, Executive Chairman
Jay Hambro said Jan. 12.  Amurmetall’s press office wasn’t immediately available for
comment when Bloomberg News called.  To contact the reporter on this story:
