The productivity of U.S. workers rose
in the fourth quarter at a slower pace than in the prior three
months, showing companies are reaching the limits of how much
efficiency they can squeeze from existing workforces.  The measure of worker output per hour increased at a 0.7
percent annual rate following a 1.9 percent gain in the prior
three months, figures from the Labor Department showed today in
 Washington . Expenses per employee climbed at a 1.2 percent rate
after dropping 2.1 percent in the third quarter.  Businesses in the U.S. that are growing more confident
about the economy may be hiring more workers after the recession
and its aftermath led them to search for ways to lift efficiency
without creating new jobs. Payrolls grew by 145,000 in January,
a Labor Department report is forecast to show tomorrow.  “In order to increase output, businesses, and manufacturers
in particular, are just going to have to bring more people
back,” said Robert Dye , chief economist at Comerica Inc. in
 Dallas . “They’re not going to get by only on technology in the
short run. This is the backside of all the very robust
productivity gains we had in 2008, 2009.”  Fourth-quarter productivity was projected to rise 0.8
percent, according to the median forecast of 59 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Estimates ranged from a 0.5 percent
drop to gains of 2 percent.  Unit labor costs, which are adjusted for efficiency gains,
were forecast to rise 0.8 percent, the survey median showed.  Another Labor Department report today showed claims for
jobless benefits fell last week, indicating the labor market is
improving.  Fewer Claims  Applications (INJCJC)  for unemployment insurance payments dropped by
12,000 to 367,000 in the week ended Jan. 28. The median forecast
of 46 economists in a Bloomberg survey projected 371,000.  Stock-index futures rose after the reports, erasing earlier
losses. The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index maturing
in March climbed 0.1 percent to 1,321.3 at 8:43 a.m. in  New
York .  Treasury securities  were little changed.  For all of 2011, productivity also climbed 0.7 percent, the
smallest increase since 2008, when it rose 0.6 percent. The
advance is smaller than the 2.5 percent increase on average from
2000 to 2010, indicating efficiency gains are getting harder to
come by.  While businesses were able to boost productivity during the
recession as employment fell faster than output,  researchers  at
the  Congressional Budget Office  are among those predicting the
severity of the 2007-2009 slump will diminish future gains.  Effects of Recession  “The recession could also reduce the growth of potential
total factor productivity over the next several years by
delaying how quickly resources are reallocated to their most
productive uses, slowing the rate at which workers gain new
skills as technologies evolve, and curtailing businesses’
spending on research and development,” the report said.  Labor expenses last year increased 1.2 percent, the most
since a 2.8 percent gain in 2008. Adjusted for inflation, hourly
earnings dropped 1.2 percent in 2011, the biggest decrease since
1989, the report showed.  Among manufacturers, productivity decreased at a 0.4
percent rate in the fourth quarter.  The  U.S. economy  expanded at a 2.8 percent annual pace in
the final three months of 2011, the fastest rate in more than a
year, Commerce Department figures showed last week.  More Hiring  Employment gains accompanied that growth. Payrolls rose by
412,000 workers from October through December. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey ahead of tomorrow’s Labor
Department release projects employment increased again in
January.  Parts suppliers “have been able to feel a little more
confident about hiring people back, maybe taking on a second
shift, investing in some capacity, whatever their particular
need is and just feeling a little bit better and as they go into
2012,” Mark Pigott, chief executive officer of  Paccar Inc. (PCAR) ,
said in a Jan. 31 conference call.  The Bellevue, Washington-based maker of Kenworth and
Peterbilt trucks said it estimates U.S. and Canadian truck sales
will rise by around 14 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
