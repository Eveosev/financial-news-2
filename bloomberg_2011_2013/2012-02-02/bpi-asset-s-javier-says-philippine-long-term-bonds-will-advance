Theresa Marcial-Javier, senior vice
president in  Manila  at BPI Asset Management, which oversees 670
billion pesos ($15.7 billion), comments on the outlook for
Philippine bonds in an interview. BPI Asset prefers buying debt
maturing in between 10 years and 25 years as yields on the notes
may fall as much as 50 basis points, she said.  “We expect inflation to be generally low. The central bank
has a lot of room to cut the policy rate. Our trading team is
looking at at least a 50-basis point rate cut. We’ve already
seen one 25-basis point cut this year, maybe there will be
another 25-basis point reduction by March.  ‘‘We expect the currency to remain strong, partly because
of inflows plus the overall positive fundamentals of the
country. Remittance is a mature industry that will probably grow
at most 8 percent.  ‘‘The issue is how much liquidity there is in the system,
where yields might go given the level of liquidity. There’s 1.7
trillion pesos in the special deposit account of the central
bank. That’s short-term money being parked that can easily be
channeled into other uses.  ‘‘For the funds that we are managing, our team is still
looking at a further drop in bond yields at the long end, in the
10 years and all the way up to 25 years. There may be
corrections along the way but any correction would be an
opportunity to build up long positions. Individual customers are
looking at the sweet spot of five to seven-year corporate
bonds.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
