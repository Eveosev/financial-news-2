The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 12:23 p.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  dropped 0.3 percent to 13,826.56, while the
Colcap Index fell 0.2 percent to 1,631.49.  Bolsa de Valores de Colombia SA  (BVC CB), the operator of
 Colombia ’s main stock exchange, rose 1.7 percent to 29.1 pesos,
a two-month high.  The number of Colombian equity offerings will likely match
last year’s record eight deals as businesses fund expansions to
tap the fastest economic growth in nearly five years, Juan Pablo
Cordoba, president of the company, said in an interview.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , Colombia’s largest oil company,
rose 0.6 percent to 4,655 pesos.  The company’s Cartagena refinery will borrow $591 million
from a group of banks to help finance an expansion to more than
double its capacity by 2014.  Reficar, as the Cartagena-based refinery is known, probably
will tap the funds over the next two years, refinery Chief
Executive Officer Orlando Cabrales said today in an interview in
Cartagena.  To contact the reporter on this story:
