(Corrects headline and first paragraph of story first
published Feb. 1 to show Owen was referring to prices.)  Yields for Hong Kong Dim Sum bond
issuance won’t “come back any time soon” to levels seen last
year amid concern the yuan’s appreciation is limited, Caroline
Owen, head of debt origination for  North America  at Standard
Chartered Plc, said at the Bloomberg Link China conference in
 New York .  Issuers were able to price three-year bonds at yields
around 1 percent last year, she said. America Movil SAB sold 1
billion yuan ($159 million) of three-year debt yesterday to
yield 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
