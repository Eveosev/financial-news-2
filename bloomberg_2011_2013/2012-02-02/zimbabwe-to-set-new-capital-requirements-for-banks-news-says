Zimbabwe  will raise capital
requirements for banks from $12.5 million, the  Daily News  said,
citing central bank Governor Gideon Gono.  Gono didn’t say how much the banks would have to maintain
as minimum capital, the Harare-based newspaper said. Twenty of
Zimbabwe’s 25 licensed banks have capital reserves in excess of
$12.5 million, it said.  Barbican Bank (Pvt) Ltd. may lose its license after failing
to open a year after it was licensed, Daily News said. Royal
Bank (Pvt) Ltd. and Zimbabwe Allied Banking Group (Pvt) Ltd.
have less than $12.5 million in capital reserves, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
