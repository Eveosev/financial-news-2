Green Cargo AB, a transport and
logistics company owned by the Swedish government, is
considering selling its logistics operations, Mats Hollander, a
company spokesman said.  “We are looking at the possibility of selling the third-
party logistics business,” Hollander said in an interview
today. “We’ve seen that there is interest.”  The Swedish government is selling off state-owned companies
in an attempt to reduce the country’s debt. Since he was elected
in 2006, Prime Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt  has sold V&S Vin &
Sprit AB, the maker of Absolut vodka, property company
Vasakronan AB and its holding in stock-market operator OMX AB.
The government also has a mandate to continue cutting its 13
percent holding in  Nordea Bank AB. (NDA)   Green Cargo’s third-party logistics unit had an operating
income of about 1 billion kronor ($149 million) in 2011,
Hollander said. Sweden’s state-owned companies are worth about
600 billion kronor, with combined sales of 373 billion kronor
and a net income of 55.6 billion kronor in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
