About 38 percent of all the sugar
waiting to be loaded at ports in Brazil, the world’s largest
producer, will be shipped to the  Middle East  and North Africa,
according to data from Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  Vessels heading to the so-called MENA region will carry
219,350 metric tons of the sweetener from ports located in the
Northeast and the Center South, Brazil’s main sugar producing
areas, data from the shipping agency e-mailed yesterday showed.
Algeria is set to receive 60,550 tons, Egypt 52,000 tons and
Saudi Arabia 47,000 tons, according to the data.  Egypt’s cabinet agreed to extend a tax exemption on imports
of raw sugar from June 30 to Dec. 31, Fayza Aboulnaga, planning
minister, said today in Cairo.  Ships were waiting at the ports of Recife, Suape, Maceio,
Santos and Paranagua to load about 570,681 tons of the
sweetener, the data showed. Santos is  Brazil ’s biggest port.  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery dropped 0.2
percent to $628.50 a ton by 12:42 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London .
Raw sugar for March delivery slid 0.4 percent to 23.51 cents a
