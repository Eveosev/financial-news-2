Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields on benchmark securities lower for a second day, after
last year’s  budget deficit  was below prior government estimates.  The yield on the government’s 9.25 percent peso bonds due
May 2014 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
6.13 percent, according to the central bank. The bond’s price
rose 0.0570 centavo to 106.3980 centavos per peso.  Colombia’s consolidated budget deficit, which includes
states, municipalities and state-run companies, was 2.2 percent
of gross domestic product last year, compared with the
government’s December estimate of 2.9 percent as strong economic
growth boosts tax revenue, Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said yesterday.  “At a time when other countries are struggling with high
deficits and liquidity problems, Colombia’s story is the total
opposite,” said Julian Cardenas, head analyst at ING Pensiones
y Cesantias. “The local market continues to incorporate good
news.”  Quickening economic growth and rising foreign direct
investment are bolstering tax revenue and reducing the
government’s financing needs. Tax revenue surged 25 percent in
2011 to 83.7 trillion pesos ($46.7 billion) from a year ago,
Echeverry said.  The Andean country suspended auctions of short-term notes,
known as TCOs, for the first half of 2012 as increased cash
holdings reduced the need for liquidity, Echeverry said
yesterday. The government in June will decide if it carries out
the auctions in the second half of the year, he said.  Ecopetrol Refinery  This year the government targets a consolidated budget
deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP and a central government budget
deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP, down from 2.9 percent in 2011,
Echeverry said.  The peso climbed 0.3 percent to 1,793.88 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,799.63 yesterday. Earlier it touched 1,789.43, its
strongest level since Sept. 8. The currency has gained 8.1
percent this year.  Ecopetrol SA’s second-largest refinery will begin tapping a
loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank as part of a plan to
borrow $922 million this month to more than double capacity by
2014. Reficar, as the Cartagena, Colombia-based refinery is
known, this month will use a portion of the $2.8 billion loan
approved last year as it builds facilities to increase
production of diesel and other fuels, company Chief Executive
Orlando Cabrales said today in an interview.  The news helped gains in the peso, according to Julian Marquez, an analyst at Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s largest
brokerage.  “Ecopetrol is a big player,” Marquez said. “The market
is always wondering whether they are bringing in money or not.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
