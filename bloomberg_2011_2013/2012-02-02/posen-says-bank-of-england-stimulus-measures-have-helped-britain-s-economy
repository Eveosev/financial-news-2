Bank of England policy maker  Adam Posen  said the central bank’s bond-purchase program isn’t
inflationary and has helped the U.K. economy.  “We are affecting demand,” Posen said on BBC Radio today.
“Things would have been much worse if we hadn’t done the
quantitative easing that I advocated.”  He said that quantitative easing “isn’t about” inflation
and that consumer-price growth will continue to ease this year.  Posen also said that credit is due to the  European Central
Bank  for its three-year loans to banks.   The loans “have worked out pretty well,” he said. “The
interbank markets are definitely improved. They’re not great,
but they are improved.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
