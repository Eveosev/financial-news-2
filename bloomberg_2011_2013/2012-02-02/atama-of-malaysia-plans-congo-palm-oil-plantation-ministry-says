Atama Plantation Ltd. of  Malaysia 
plans to invest 150 billion CFA francs ($300 million) in the
Republic of Congo over the next 15 years developing a  palm-oil 
project, the Central African nation’s Agriculture Ministry said.  The company plans to grow the crop on 470,000 hectares
(1.16 million) acres, producing about 90,000 metric tons of the
world’s most-consumed vegetable oil yearly, the Ministry said in
a statement dated Jan. 31 and distributed to reporters today in
Brazzaville, the capital. The project will be located halfway
between the northern Congolese districts of Makoua and Mokeko,
it said.  Atama will also build an agro-industrial plant to process
the palm oil, creating 20,000 jobs, the ministry said.  Atama didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment
sent to an e-mail address listed on its  website , which is still
under construction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
