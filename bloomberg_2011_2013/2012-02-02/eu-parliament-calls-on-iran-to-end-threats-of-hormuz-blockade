The  European Parliament  urged  Iran  to
back down from threats to block shipping in the  Strait of
Hormuz , saying the disruption to trade could stoke international
tensions.  “Such an act could lead to a regional conflict and trigger
retaliation by the international community,” the 27-nation
European Union assembly said in a resolution approved today in
Brussels.  Iran has threatened to shut down the Strait of Hormuz,
through which about a fifth of globally traded oil passes, as
the EU prepares to ban imports of Iranian petroleum starting on
July 1. The European plan, approved by EU governments last
month, stems from concerns that Iran is seeking to develop
nuclear weapons.  The EU Parliament said the oil embargo could help persuade
the Iranian government “to accept and respect” United Nations
resolutions on the country’s nuclear activities. The Iranian
regime says its atomic program is for civilian purposes
including electricity production.  In its resolution, the 754-seat EU Parliament also said it
“regrets” the refusal of China and  Russia  in the UN Security
Council to back sanctions against Iran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
