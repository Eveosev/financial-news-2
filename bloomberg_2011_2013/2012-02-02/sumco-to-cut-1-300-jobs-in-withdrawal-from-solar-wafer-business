Sumco Corp., a Japanese silicon wafer
maker, said it will cut about 1,300 jobs amounting to 15 percent
of its workforce as it withdraws from supplying solar panel
makers following a plunge in prices for the raw materials.  The solar wafer business is expected to incur a
“significant loss due to the sharp decline in demand and
continued price collapse since last spring,” Sumco said in a
business  plan  released today.  Sumco forecast a full-year loss of 85 billion yen ($1.1
billion) and asked  Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. (5405) , which owns a
28 percent stake, to buy preferred shares. The company took a
charge of 58.2 billion yen for the restructuring.  “This is the first Japanese casualty manufacturer from
plummeting global solar costs,” said Jenny Chase, chief solar
analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “Other diversified
players in the country are feeling the pinch too.”  The Tokyo-based company will dissolve and liquidate its
subsidiaries, Sumco Solar Corp. and Minamata Denshi Co.,
according to a separate  statement.  Sumco Solar makes solar
wafer, and Minamata Denshi processes raw materials for the solar
business.  Sumco said the job cuts would be made by the end of January
2014. Under Sumco’s business plan, the company will close the
Imari solar plant in Saga prefecture and the Ikuno plant in
Hyogo prefecture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
