The brains of addicts and their
healthy siblings are different than those of unrelated, healthy
volunteers, a study has found, suggesting vulnerability to drug
dependency may be partly inherited.  The aberrations were found in brain scans on 150 subjects.
They exist in areas thought to govern self-control and habit-
formation, the researchers said. Having a family member with an
addiction raised the odds of becoming dependent about eightfold,
said  Karen Ersche , a researcher at the University of Cambridge
in the U.K. and the study’s lead author.  The results, reported today in the journal  Science , may
spur new testing to determine who is most at risk to develop
addiction, said Nora Volkow, director of the  National Institute
on Drug Abuse  in Bethesda,  Maryland , who wrote an editorial
accompanying the paper. The next thing to study might be why one
sibling became addicted and another didn’t.  “We have the means now to develop a potential biomarker
for determining poor self-control,” Volkow, who wasn’t involved
in the research, said in a telephone interview today. “That
could, for example, be used to identify those at greater risk
and develop prevention.”  The brain scans show the addicted subjects and their
siblings had less white matter tracts near the right inferior
frontal cortex, a region known to be involved in self control,
Ersche said. The siblings also showed more tissue volume in
areas such as the putamen and  amygdala  that are associated with
habit formation.  Determining Why  That makes sense, since most people who try drugs don’t get
addicted, Ersche said. “Cocaine is a highly addictive drug but
not everyone who uses it gets dependent. Only about 20 percent
of people who use cocaine get dependent,” she said.  The data may also suggest that strategies for increasing
self-control may help those at risk for addiction.  “What I have noticed is that siblings who don’t get
addicted had other goals,” Ersche said. “They’d tried cannabis
or ecstasy, but had other things they wanted to pursue, like
education or sport. We need to follow up to see whether that’s
significant.”  The study was funded by the U.K.’s Medical Research
Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
