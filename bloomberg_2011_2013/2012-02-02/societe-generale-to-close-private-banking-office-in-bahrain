Societe Generale SA (GLE)  will move its
private banking office in Bahrain to the  United Arab Emirates  as
the French lender seeks to cut costs, an official at the bank
said.  Societe Generale decided to centralize its private banking
business in the U.A.E., said the official, who declined to be
identified because the matter is private. Zawya Dow Jones
reported the news earlier today.  Societe Generale opened the wealth management office in
Bahrain in November 2009 as part of its expansion in the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
