Saracens players Brad Barritt and
Owen Farrell will form a new center pairing for  England ’s rugby
squad this weekend against  Scotland , while Northampton’s Phil
Dowson will make its debut at no. 8 for the team.  The three will play for England for the first time in the 6
Nations match at Murrayfield, the Rugby Football Union said
today in an e-mailed statement.  There will be five more uncapped players on the bench as
England coach Stuart Lancaster tries to break from last year’s
disappointments and disruptions at the  World Cup . The squad
reached the quarterfinals in  New Zealand , one step short of its
goal, and made headlines during the tournament with a series of
events involving players and staff. Manager  Martin Johnson  quit
and Lancaster took over.  “We have been impressed with how the whole group has come
together in the last 10 days, and we have done a lot of work on
and off the field,” Lancaster said in the statement. “It is a
massive challenge.”  T*
