Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told the House Budget Committee that some countries in
the euro area could have slow-growing economies “for quite a
while.”  The Fed chairman said the European Central Bank’s long-term
financing program for the banking system has “taken away some
of the financial stress.” European leaders have also made
progress on mutual surveillance of fiscal policies, he said.  “There is an awful lot that remains to be done” in
Europe, Bernanke said during a question-and-answer period
following his remarks to the committee on the  U.S. economy .
“The banking system remains undercapitalized; it has been
contracting its credit, which is contributing to a weakening
economy in many countries in Europe.”  Bernanke said the region also has to resolve “deep
fundamental problems,” including differences in competitiveness
between countries such as Greece and  Germany .  “All of those things put together mean you could have very
slow growth in some European countries for quite a while,”
Bernanke said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
