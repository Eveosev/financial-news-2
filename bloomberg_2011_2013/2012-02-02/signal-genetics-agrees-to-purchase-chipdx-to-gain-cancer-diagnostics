Signal Genetics , a closely held
cancer testing company, agreed to buy  ChipDX LLC  to add
diagnostic products in development for lung, breast and colon
cancers.  The acquisition also adds closely held ChipDX’s technology
to enable for remote interpretation of tests, New York-based
Signal said today. Financial details weren’t disclosed.  Signal makes a prognostic test for multiple myeloma called
MyPRS Plus, and will use its sales team to bring ChipDX’s
products to market, the company said. ChipDX’s BreastGeneDX,
ColonGeneDX and LungGeneDX products are designed to determine
patients’ cancer risk levels.  “The acquisition of the intellectual property and patents
of ChipDX dramatically expands and enhances our oncology
pipeline,” Signal Chief Executive Officer Joe Hernandez said in
a statement. “The addition of ChipDX’s bioinformatics
capabilities drastically reduces our time to market with novel
molecular tests designed to facilitate better patient outcomes
at a lower cost profile.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
