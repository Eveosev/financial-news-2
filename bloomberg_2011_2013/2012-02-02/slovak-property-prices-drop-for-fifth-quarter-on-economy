Slovak residential property prices
dropped 1 percent in the last three months of 2011, the fifth
quarterly decline, as government austerity measures hurt demand,
the central bank said.  The average price for residential property declined to
1,236 euros ($1,623) per square meter (10.8 square feet) from
1,248 euros in the third quarter, the Bratislava, Slovakia-based
Narodna Banka Slovenska  said  today on its website. Prices fell
2.7 percent on the year.  The residential-property market in the eastern euro-area
member is struggling as the economy is slowing and government
austerity measures have depressed demand. The average price of
residential property is 20 percent down from a peak reached in
the second quarter of 2008.  Prices varied from 634 euros a square meter in the Nitra
region of western Slovakia, to 1,662 euros in the capital,
Bratislava.  To contact the reporter on this story:
