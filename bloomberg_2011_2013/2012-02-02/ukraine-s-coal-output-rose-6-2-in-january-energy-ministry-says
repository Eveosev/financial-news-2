Ukraine’s coal output rose by 6.2
percent in January from a year earlier, the country’s Energy and
Coal Ministry said without giving a reason.  Coal production increased to 6.97 million metric tons in
January, which is 1.13 million tons more than the government
planned and 405,300 tons more than in January last year, the
Kiev-based ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter son this story:
