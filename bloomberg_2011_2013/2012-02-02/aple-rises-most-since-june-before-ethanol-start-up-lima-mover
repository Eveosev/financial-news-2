Maple Energy Plc (MPLE)  surged the most in
almost eight months on prospects that the oil and gas producer
will start ethanol output this quarter at a $245 million plant.  Maple jumped 9 percent to $1.33 at 2:55 p.m. in Lima, the
biggest jump on a closing basis since June 7.  “Investors saw an opportunity before the company’s ethanol
project starts up,” BBVA Continental SAB’s Chief Executive
Officer Jorge Ramos said in a telephone interview. “The market
is also bullish due to the strong earnings season so far.”  Maple, which produces 500 barrels a day of oil and liquid
gas and operates a 3,000 barrel-a-day oil refinery in Peru’s
central jungle, aims to sell part of its 35 million gallons of
annual ethanol output to refineries operated by  Repsol YPF SA (REP) 
and Petroleos del Peru SA and export to the U.S. and Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
