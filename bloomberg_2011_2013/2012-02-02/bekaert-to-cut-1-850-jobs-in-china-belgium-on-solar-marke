Bekaert NV (BEKB) , the world’s largest maker
of steel cord used in tires, fell the most in six months in
Brussels trading after saying it will need to save 100 million
euros ($131 million) a year to restore  profitability  after
erasing 1,850 positions amid cutbacks in sawing-wire output.  The shares dropped 3.87 euros, or 12 percent, to 29.40
euros at the 5:40 p.m. close of trading on Euronext Brussels.
That’s the biggest decline since July 29 and trimmed the stock’s
 advance  so far this year to 14 percent.  Bekaert is erasing 1,250 positions in Chinese plants
producing sawing wire used to slice silicon ingots into wafers
for solar cells and plans to cut an additional 600 positions in
 Belgium , or about 23 percent of its  workforce  in the country.
The Zwevegem, Belgium-based company said it needs to save an
additional 100 million euros annually to restore “long-term
profitability,” according to a  statement  released today.  Prices for Bekaert’s sawing wire collapsed last year amid
overcapacity for the material as competitors including  Xingda
International Holdings Ltd. (1899)  ramped up output in  China  and global
production of solar panels slowed down. Bekaert  aims  for
earnings before interest and taxes of at least 7 percent of
sales. Profitability by that measure shrank to 13 percent in the
first half as margins in the Asia-Pacific region narrowed to 29
percent from 38 percent in the preceding six-month period.  “Management indicated that both prices and volumes have
continued to decline throughout the year,” said Filip De Pauw,
an analyst at ING Groep NV in Brussels. “The cost savings
target suggests Bekaert didn’t meet its long-term EBIT guidance
in the second half.”  Bekaert may report adjusted profit of 2.22 euros a share
this year, according to the average of 12 analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg before today’s announcement. Management
said it expects reorganization costs will exceed the 84 million
euros of expenses it made in 2008 for the closure of Belgian
plants in Lanklaar and Hemiksem, De Pauw said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
