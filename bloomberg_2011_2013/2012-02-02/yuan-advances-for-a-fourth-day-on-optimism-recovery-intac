China ’s yuan rose for a fourth
straight day, its longest winning streak since October, on signs
global economic recovery will withstand Europe’s credit crisis.  U.S. manufacturing grew at the fastest pace since June last
month and China’s  purchasing managers’ index  rose more than
economists predicted, data showed this week. The  European
Central Bank  is unlikely to show its hand on how it will help
cut Greece’s debts until investors and the government have
agreed on a deal, according to economists from ING Group to
Deutsche Bank.  “Investors are pleasantly surprised by the latest set of
global manufacturing data, which implies brighter prospects for
Chinese exports,” said Stella Lee, president of Success Futures
& Foreign Exchange Ltd. in Hong Kong. “However, investors won’t
be blindly optimistic as they know that the problems in  Europe ,
if they worsen, could drag the market down.”  The yuan advanced 0.08 percent to close at 6.3018 per
dollar in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The currency has gained 0.59 percent this week.  The People’s Bank of China raised the daily  reference rate 
by 0.04 percent to 6.3075. The yuan is allowed to trade as much
as 0.5 percent on either side of the rate.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan was little changed
at 6.2950, after rising 0.3 percent in the past two days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-
deliverable forwards gained 0.12 percent to 6.2730, at a 0.5
percent premium to the onshore rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
