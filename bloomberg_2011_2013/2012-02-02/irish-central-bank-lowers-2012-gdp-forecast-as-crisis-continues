Ireland’s central bank lowered its
economic growth forecast for 2012, as export growth slows and
 consumer spending  falls.  Gross domestic product will rise 0.5 percent this year,
before accelerating to 2.1 percent in 2013, the Dublin-based
central bank said in its quarterly bulletin on its website
today. The bank had forecast 2012 growth of 1.8 percent in
October.  “The slowdown in the external environment has occurred
against the background of an intensification of the sovereign
debt crisis, the effects of which has now broadened beyond the
financial system to the wider economy,” the bank said today.  Slowing growth in Ireland’s trading partners may hamper the
economy as the government tries to cut the fiscal deficit.
Still, Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  should achieve his target
of narrowing the budget shortfall to 8.6 percent of GDP, the
bank said.  “On the face of it, the consolidation measures announced,
and the somewhat better starting position for 2012, should allow
the targeted reduction of the deficit to take place,” the bank
said. “But the pattern of growth will clearly determine
developments to a degree.”  Personal expenditure is forecast to decline 1.5 percent
this year, the central bank, led by  Patrick Honohan , said.
Exports will rise 3.9 percent in 2012, the bank said, lowering
an earlier forecast of 5.2 percent, as the debt crisis ripples
on.  Unemployment this year will average 14.6 percent, the bank
said, raising its forecast from 14 percent.  “Markets remain tense and output growth is weak,” the
central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
