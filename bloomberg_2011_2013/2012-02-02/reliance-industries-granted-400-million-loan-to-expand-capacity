Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of
the world’s largest refining complex, has been granted a $400
million equivalent loan to expand production in  India , according
to SACE SpA, an Italian export-credit agency.  The loan will be guaranteed by SACE, according to an e-mail
from the agency in response to questions from Bloomberg.  Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s company, which last month
reported its first quarterly drop in profits, is facing a
decline in global demand for oil products as economic growth
slows. Lower refining margins are hurting producers in  China  and
India which plan to raise refining capacity to a record this
year.  SACE’s guarantee will support contracts for the supply of
goods and services to Italian companies, SACE said in the e-mail
today, without naming any companies. This deal is the fourth
concluded with Reliance since 2004 and brings to $1 billion the
total credit facilities backed by SACE for the Mumbai-based
company.  SACE and Reliance will sign the loan agreement at SACE’s
headquarters in  Rome  today, according to the e-mail.  Reliance will use the loan proceeds to expand and upgrade
the production capacity of its petrochemical plants, a
gasification plant and refinery off-gas cracker as part of an
investment plan in India worth more than $11 billion, according
to the e-mail.  -- Editors: Katrina Nicholas, Mohammed Hadi  To contact the reporter on this story:
