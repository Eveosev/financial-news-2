OAO Gazprom Neft (SIBN) , the oil arm of the
world’s biggest natural-gas producer, may slow the development
of three new fields unless the Russian government offers tax
breaks, said Deputy Chief Executive Officer Vadim Yakovlev.  The Messoyakha, Novoport and Kuyumba fields “require a tax
decision this year or we will need to slow down the projects
next year,” Yakovlev told reporters today in St. Petersburg.  The final  investment decision  hasn’t been made yet for
these projects, Yakovlev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
