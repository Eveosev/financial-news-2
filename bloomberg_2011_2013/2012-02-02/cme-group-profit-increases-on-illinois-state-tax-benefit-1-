CME Group Inc. (CME) , owner of the world’s
largest futures market, said fourth-quarter profit rose because
of an Illinois tax benefit.  Net income climbed to $746 million, or $11.25 a share, from
$196 million, or $2.93 a share, a year earlier, Chicago-based
CME said today in a statement distributed by PR Newswire.
Excluding the tax benefit and other items, profit was $236
million, or $3.55 a share, trailing the average estimate of
$3.64 in a Bloomberg survey of 20 analysts. Daily futures and
options volume in the quarter averaged 11.7 million contracts,
down 2 percent from a year earlier, CME said in a Jan. 4
statement.  Futures contracts based on indexes such as the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index or the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  traded on
average 3.1 million times a day in the quarter, up from 2.5
million in the year-ago period, CME Group said last month.
Interest-rate contracts, the largest category of futures at the
exchange, fell 15 percent to an average 4.7 million a day.  Volume for the CME’s ClearPort service, which guarantees
swap contracts with its clearinghouse and generates the
company’s highest fees per contract, jumped 20 percent in the
quarter.  Revenue fell 3.5 percent to $737 million in the three
months ended Dec. 31, from $763 million a year earlier, the
company said.  CME Group  shares  have fallen 22 percent over the past year
through yesterday. They rose $5.97, or 2.5 percent, to $245.48
yesterday in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading.  (CME Group will hold a conference call for analysts and
