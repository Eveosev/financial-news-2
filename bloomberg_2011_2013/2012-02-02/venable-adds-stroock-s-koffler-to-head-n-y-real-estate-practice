Venable LLP (1214L) , the Washington-based  law
firm , hired Peter G. Koffler, a partner at  Stroock & Stroock &
Lavan LLP , as the firm expands its  New York  real estate
practice.  Koffler joined Venable’s New York office and will lead its
real estate group, the firm said today in a statement.  “We are looking for him to add a new level of leadership
to our growing New York profile, and we’re certain he’ll play a
major role in the continued building of our real estate
representation here as well as across the country,”  Edmund M.
O’Toole , the partner in charge of Venable’s New York office,
said in the statement.  Koffler has advised on acquisitions, sales, financing,
joint ventures, development and leasing, as well as power plant
and energy projects and the redevelopment of polluted land,
Venable said.  Venable, which advised  CWCapital Asset Management LLC  in
the foreclosure on the Stuyvesant Town residential complex in
 New York City  in 2010, was the 78th-largest grossing law firm in
2010, with revenue of $337.5 million,  according  to the American
Lawyer, a trade magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
