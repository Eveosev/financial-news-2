Taiwan ’s dollar advanced to a four-
month high after U.S. economic data eased concern the world’s
largest economy is slowing, improving the outlook for the
island’s exports.  Government bonds  were little changed.  Global funds bought $1 billion more Taiwanese stocks than
they sold this week, taking net purchases for the year to $2.1
billion, according to exchange data. U.S. manufacturing grew at
the fastest pace since June, according to a report yesterday,
while government data showed construction spending increased
more than forecast.  “Risk sentiment is quite strong today as we have some
positive news from the U.S.,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income
trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “That also sapped
demand for government bonds.”  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.5 percent to NT$29.550
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency touched NT$29.450 earlier, the strongest level since
Sept. 13. The yield on the government’s 1 percent notes due
January 2017 was little changed at 0.931 percent, prices from
Gretai Securities Market show.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 0.393 percent, according to a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
