Copper declined amid concern that
Chinese demand may decline as home prices in the world’s largest
user continued to slide and the possibility of a hard landing
this year for the country’s economy persisted.  The metal for delivery in three months lost as much as 0.8
percent to $8,370 a metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange and
traded at $8,425 by 3 p.m.  Shanghai  time. March-delivery copper
dropped 0.3 percent to $3.8295 per pound on the Comex.  Home prices in  China  fell for a fifth month in January,
declining 0.18 percent from December, SouFun Holdings Ltd., the
nation’s biggest real-estate website owner, said yesterday. That
was the longest losing streak since the company started tracking
the data in July 2010. Real prices could drop as much as 15
percent, said Sonny Kalsi, a founder of GreenOak Real Estate and
former global co-head of property at Morgan Stanley.  “The property sector, directly and indirectly, accounts
for about half of the copper use, so if the situation worsens,
it could be a really serious risk to the demand side,” Li Peng,
an analyst at Guotai Junan Futures Co., said by phone from
Shanghai. “Last year, social housing construction offered
support to demand, but I’m worried about this year.”  China’s economy  is headed for a hard landing this year as
weaker demand overseas chokes off exports, said Gary Shilling,
president of A. Gary Shilling & Co., who correctly forecast the
U.S. recession that began in December 2007. Investors should bet
on declines in Chinese stocks and commodities to hedge against
such an outcome, he said.  April-delivery copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
climbed 0.6 percent to close at 59,880 yuan ($9,505) per ton,
catching up with gains in London yesterday.  Aluminum was little changed at $2,263.25 a ton on the LME.
Zinc fell 0.5 percent to $2,120 a ton and lead was little
changed at $2,236.50 a ton. Nickel rose 0.7 percent to $21,113
per ton and tin gained 0.6 percent to $24,300 per ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
