NewMarket Corp. (NEU) , an additives maker
for motor fuel and lubricants, declined the most in more than
two years after reporting fourth-quarter profit missed analysts’
estimates.  NewMarket, based in Richmond, Virginia, fell 13 percent to
close at $191.07 in New York today, the most  since  Jan. 29,
2010.  Net income fell 32 percent to $33.7 million, or $2.51 a
share, from $49.4 million, or $3.47, a year earlier, NewMarket
said in a statement issued after the close of regular trading
yesterday. Excluding losses from interest rate contracts, per-
share profit was 85 cents less than the average of five
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales rose 9.8 percent to $502.7 million. Operating profit
from petroleum additives, NewMarket’s largest business, fell 18
percent from the year-earlier quarter to $59.3 million as
shipments fell, reflecting reduced customer inventory and
demand, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
