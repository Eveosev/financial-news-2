offsetting declines in Unilever and  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  that
predicted a difficult year ahead for earnings.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  jumped 9.9 percent after Glencore International
Plc, the world’s largest listed commodity trader, started talks
to buy the shares in Xstrata that it doesn’t already own.
