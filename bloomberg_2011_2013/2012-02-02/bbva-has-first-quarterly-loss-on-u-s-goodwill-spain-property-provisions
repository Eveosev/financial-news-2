Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
Spain’s second-biggest bank, posted its first-ever quarterly
loss after booking charges to write down goodwill at its U.S.
unit and increasing provisions for bad loans.  The fourth-quarter loss was 139 million euros ($183.1
million), compared with net income of 939 million euros a year
earlier, the Bilbao, Spain-based bank said in a filing today.
The  shares  rose as operating income climbed to 2.86 billion
euros from 2.62 billion euros a year ago.  BBVA took a 1 billion-euro charge for goodwill at its U.S.
division, while profit in its home market plunged. The bank held
back from booking extraordinary charges for Spain’s collapsed
real-estate market, unlike its bigger rival  Banco Santander SA (SAN) ,
as the Spanish government prepares to today unveil new rules
aimed at making banks recognize more losses on property piled up
on their balance sheets.  “They’re behind the curve on the coverage of real
estate,” said Andrea Filtri, an analyst at Mediobanca SpA in
 London . “Overall revenue is good.”  The net loss was worse than the average 88.2 million-euro
loss estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 13 analysts.  Shares Rise  BBVA shares rose 0.9 percent to 6.95 euros at 11:27 a.m. in
Madrid, as the pan-European  Stoxx 600 Banks Index  traded almost
unchanged. The shares have risen about 4 percent this year,
valuing the bank at 34 billion euros, after declining 12 percent
in 2011.  Santander, which posted a 98 percent drop in fourth-quarter
earnings on Jan. 31 because of one-time charges partly linked to
a real-estate cleanup, has gained 5.5 percent this year.  BBVA’s net interest income rose 11 percent from the same
quarter a year ago to 3.49 billion euros, a result that
Citigroup Inc. analysts described as “very strong” in a note
on the results today. Gross lending climbed 3.7 percent from a
year ago and deposits increased 2.3 percent.  The lender, led by Chairman  Francisco Gonzalez , 67, said on
Jan. 10 it would take the U.S. goodwill charge to account for
the outlook for growth and regulation in the country. Goodwill
is the amount exceeding fair net book value paid at the time of
an acquisition. BBVA had already taken a 704 million-euro
writedown for U.S. goodwill against 2009 earnings after building
up its business there with the $9 billion purchase of Compass
Bancshares Inc. in 2007.  Real-Estate Provisions  The bank said it had 7.71 billion euros of foreclosed or
acquired real estate, up from 6.63 billion euros in September,
and provisions set aside to cover 34 percent of that property’s
value, up from 33 percent. That contrasts with Santander, which
boosted the provisioning level for its own 8.6 billion euros of
real estate to 50 percent from 31 percent, and took 1.81 billion
euros in pretax charges.  The bank didn’t boost its coverage of real estate ahead of
the government announcement because it didn’t want to make a
“partial” adjustment that would also risk confusing people,
Angel Cano, BBVA’s president and chief operating officer, said
on a webcast for analysts today.  “We hope this happens rapidly and in a decisive way,”
said Cano, referring to the restructuring of financial system to
be announced by the government, adding he hoped it would help
restore “normal life” to the industry in  Spain .  BBVA’s bad loans as a proportion of total loans fell to 4
percent from 4.1 percent in September. Loans newly classified as
in default jumped to 3.61 billion euros from 2.92 billion euros
in the third quarter.  Costs for asset impairments rose to 1.34 billion euros in
the fourth quarter from 1.11 billion euros a year ago, as the
bank said it took advantage of higher income in the period to
increase its loan-loss reserves.  Spain, Latin America  Profit from Spain, which accounts for about 60 percent of
the bank’s loans, fell 46 percent from a year earlier to 202
million euros in the quarter. Lending at its Spanish division
dropped 1.7 percent as the bad loans ratio dipped to 4.8 percent
from 4.9 percent in June. BBVA expects stable asset quality in
Spain in 2012, even as the country dips into recession, Cano
said.  Earnings from  Mexico , BBVA’s biggest-earning division,
climbed to 494 million euros from 440 million euros a year
earlier.  Earnings from  South America  rose to 251 million euros from
187 million euros a year earlier. Profit from Eurasia, which
includes BBVA’s businesses in  Turkey  and  China  and its
operations in  Europe  outside Spain, rose to 322 million euros
from 169 million euros a year ago.  BBVA finished 2011 with a core capital ratio under European
Banking Authority criteria of 8.7 percent after adding 5.3
billion euros of capital in the last quarter of the year. BBVA
will meet the 9 percent requirement by a June deadline “through
organic means,” the bank said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
