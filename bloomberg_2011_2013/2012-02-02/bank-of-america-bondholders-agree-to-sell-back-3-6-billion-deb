Bank of America Corp. , the second-
biggest U.S. lender by assets, sold $2.25 billion of bonds in
its largest offering since July while increasing the amount of
debt itâ€™s buying back as part of a tender offer.  The company issued $750 million of 5.7 percent notes due in
2022 in an add-on to a previous sale and $1.5 billion of 5.875
percent, 30-year bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The 5.7 percent debt pays 3.25 percentage points above similar-
maturity Treasuries, and the 30-year debt pays a 2.97 percentage
point spread, the data show.  Bank of America, based in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina ,
marketed the securities after bondholders offered to sell back
$3.59 billion of subordinated debt to it as part of a tender
offer. The bank, which proposed to buy $1.5 billion of the
bonds, raised that amount, it said today in a statement.
Yesterday was the early tender deadline, which included a
payment of 3 percent of face value. The offer expires Feb. 15.  The bank is reducing more expensive long-term debt as Chief
Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  seeks to cut holdings,
expenses and staff while raising capital to meet demands from
regulators for a larger cushion against losses. The bonds that
the bank is seeking to buy back are denominated in euros, pounds
and Canadian and U.S. dollars, with  interest rates  as high as
8.125 percent.  Bank of America issued $2.5 billion of debt in July,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
