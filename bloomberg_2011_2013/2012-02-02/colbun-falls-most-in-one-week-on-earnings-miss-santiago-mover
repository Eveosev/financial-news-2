Colbun SA (COLBUN) ,  Chile ’s third-largest
power generator, declined the most in two weeks after fourth-
quarter earnings missed some analysts’ estimates.  Colbun fell for the first time in three days, losing 1.1
percent to 127.83 pesos, the steepest slump since Jan. 16.  Net income of $32.3 million, reported after the close of
trading yesterday, trailed Banchile Inversiones’ $41.5 million
forecast. Annual profit tumbled to $5.2 million from $112
million as dry weather limited hydroelectric generation, forcing
companies to use higher cost fuels to produce power.  “Given that Colbun’s results were lower than expected we
could see certain pressure on the share price,” Banchile
analysts wrote in an e-mailed note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
