U.S. stock-index futures erased
declines after initial jobless claims decreased more than
forecast, bolstering optimism in the economy a day before the
government’s monthly employment data.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
March climbed less than 0.1 percent to 1,320.2 at 8:31 a.m. in
 New York  after slipping as much as 0.2 percent earlier.  Applications for unemployment insurance payments dropped by
12,000 to 367,000 in the week ended Jan. 28, Labor Department
figures showed today in Washington. The median forecast of 46
economists in a Bloomberg News survey projected 371,000.  The  S&P 500  has rallied 21 percent from its 2011 low in
October amid signs that the  U.S. economy  was weathering Europe’s
debt crisis. Government data tomorrow is forecast by economists
to show the U.S. added 145,000 jobs in January and the
 unemployment rate  held at a three-year low of 8.5 percent.    Benchmark gauges yesterday snapped a four-day decline amid
signs that manufacturing across the world is strengthening. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose above its highest closing
level since May during the day, before paring gains.  Earnings beat projections at 66 percent of the 211
companies in the S&P 500 that reported quarterly results since
Jan. 9, the data show. Profits probably grew 4.6 percent in the
fourth quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts. The
projection has fallen from 6.2 percent at the end of last year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
