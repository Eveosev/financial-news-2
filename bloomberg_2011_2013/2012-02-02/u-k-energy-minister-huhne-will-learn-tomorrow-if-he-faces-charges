U.K. prosecutors will announce
tomorrow whether Energy Secretary  Chris Huhne  will face charges
for allegedly lying about a speeding ticket to get out of a
driving ban nine years ago.  The director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, will
make the announcement in a televised statement in London at 10
a.m., the  Crown Prosecution Service  said by e-mail today.  Police in the eastern English county of Essex opened a
probe last year into allegations that Huhne asked his then wife,
Vicky Pryce, in 2003 to say she’d been driving his car when it
was caught speeding, so he wouldn’t lose his license. Huhne has
denied any wrongdoing.  Any decision to charge Huhne will put pressure on him to
resign. The energy secretary is one of five Cabinet members from
Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg ’s Liberal Democrats in David Cameron’s Conservative-led coalition. If he quits, it would open
the way for the return to the Cabinet of  David Laws , the Liberal
Democrat who stepped down as chief secretary to the Treasury
after less than three weeks in the job in 2010.  “In the event of somebody being charged with a criminal
offense, they would have to leave the government,” Clegg told
BBC television’s “Andrew Marr Show” on Jan. 22. “That has
been what’s happened in the past.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
