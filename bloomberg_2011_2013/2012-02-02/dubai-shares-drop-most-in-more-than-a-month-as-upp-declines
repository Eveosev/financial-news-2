Dubai’s benchmark stock index fell
the most in more than a month amid speculation this week’s gain
was overdone and after real-estate developer  Union Properties
PJSC (UPP)  said its full-year loss widened.  Union Properties slumped 9.8 percent, the most since
January 2010.  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , the United Arab Emirates’
biggest lender complying with Shariah rules, dropped the most
since April 2010. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  fell from a four-month
high, declining 1.2 percent to 1,435.96 at the 2 p.m. close in
the emirate, trimming this week’s gain to 2.1 percent. The
 Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  rose 0.2 percent.  “A combination of profit-taking and disappointing results
of Union Properties is dragging the market,” said Tariq Qaqish,
deputy head of asset management at Dubai-based Al Mal Capital.
Dubai’s index has  rallied  6.1 percent this year.  Union Properties said it had a net loss of 1.57 billion
dirhams ($427 million) in 2011 after a loss of 1.53 billion
dirhams a year earlier. Total assets declined to 9.1 billion
dirhams at the end of last year from 14.9 billion dirhams a year
earlier. The shares tumbled to 28.4 fils. There are 100 fils to
the dirham.  Dubai Islamic Bank declined 4.1 percent to 2.1 dirhams.  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  gained 0.4 percent and
Qatar’s measure climbed 0.8 percent. Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  and
Bahrain’s BB All Share Index were little changed.  Kuwait’s bourse was closed for a public holiday and Saudi
Arabia’s Tadawul market for the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
