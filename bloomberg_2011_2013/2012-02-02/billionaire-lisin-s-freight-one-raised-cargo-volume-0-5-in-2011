OAO Freight One, which was acquired
by Russian steelmaking billionaire  Vladimir Lisin  in the fourth
quarter, increased cargo volumes 0.5 percent to 284 million
metric tons last year.  Transportation of construction materials led growth last
year, advancing about 80 percent to more than 30 million tons,
Freight One said an e-mailed statement today. The carrier also
transported 94 million tons of coal and 68 million tons of oil,
the rail company said, without giving a year-earlier comparison.  To contact the reporter on this story:
