U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg 
said he wants former Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Laws
back in government as their fellow Liberal Democrat, Energy
Secretary  Chris Huhne , prepared to learn whether he’ll be
prosecuted for allegedly lying about a speeding ticket.  Clegg gave an interview to Parliament’s “House” magazine
before the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, said
he’d make a statement on Huhne’s case at 10 a.m. tomorrow. If he
decides to prosecute, it would pressure the energy secretary to
quit. The Liberal Democrats, junior partners in the coalition
government, have five seats at the Cabinet table.  Laws resigned in May 2010, 19 days after the formation of
the coalition, after the  Daily Telegraph  reported he had claimed
allowances to pay rent to his partner.  “What I would like to see David do is to be close to the
center of power in one shape or form, with ideally quite a broad
view of government policy,” Clegg said. “I think he’s got an
ability to see the connections between policies which is quite
unusual.”  Police in the eastern English county of Essex opened a
probe last year into allegations that Huhne asked his then wife,
Vicky Pryce, in 2003 to say she’d been driving his car when it
was caught speeding, so he wouldn’t lose his license. Huhne has
denied any wrongdoing.  “In the event of somebody being charged with a criminal
offense, they would have to leave the government,” Clegg told
BBC television’s “Andrew Marr Show” on Jan. 22. “That has
been what’s happened in the past.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
