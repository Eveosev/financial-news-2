     Feb. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Ann Inc. (ANN) , operator of Ann Taylor
stores, fell in premarket trading after announcing that fourth
quarter results would trail its original forecast.  Sales for the fourth quarter are estimated at $566 million
the New York-based company said today in a statement.
Previously, Ann forecast sales would be $580 million.  The  shares  tumbled 6.7 percent to $22.91 at 4 p.m. in New
York. Ann fell 9.5 percent last year.  Ann is “disappointed” with fourth-quarter results and is
looking to improve in 2012, said Kay Krill, chief executive
officer.  The company named Brian Lynch brand president of Ann
Taylor, which was the worst-performing division in the fourth
quarter with a 1 percent decline in sales. Lynch was previously
president of the Ann Taylor Factory and LOFT Outlet brands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
