The U.S. placed four people based in
 Europe  on a list of designated narcotics traffickers, saying
they use the trade to raise money for the outlawed Kurdistan
Workers’ Party, or PKK.  The four men in Moldova and  Romania , and three Romanian
companies, are subject to the  Foreign Narcotics Kingpin
Designation Act , and barred from carrying out financial or
commercial transactions with U.S. citizens, the Treasury’s
Office of Foreign Assets Control said in a statement e-mailed by
the U.S. embassy in Ankara.  The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in largely Kurdish
southeast  Turkey  for almost three decades, in a conflict that
has left more than 40,000 people dead, mostly Kurds. It’s
classified as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and
European Union. The U.S. labeled the group a “significant”
narcotics distributor in 2008.  “Drug trafficking is one of the PKK’s most lucrative
criminal activities and it uses the illicit proceeds to obtain
weapons and materials,” OFAC said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
