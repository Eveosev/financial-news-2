The  Bank of Japan (8301)  isn’t considering
immediate action to respond to the yen’s recent strengthening,
Deputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi said.  The currency’s moves could affect exports and corporate
profits, Yamaguchi told reporters today in Takamatsu, in western
 Japan .  The BOJ has eased monetary policy in the past to combat the
yen’s gains. It intervenes in  currency markets  at the behest of
the  finance ministry , which is responsible for setting currency
policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
