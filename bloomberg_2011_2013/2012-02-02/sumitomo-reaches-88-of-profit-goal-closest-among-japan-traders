Sumitomo Corp. (8053) ,  Japan ’s third-largest
trading house, achieved 88 percent of its annual profit target
in the nine months of its fiscal year.  Net income rose 22 percent to 219.1 billion yen ($2.88
billion) in the period ended Dec. 31 from a year earlier, Tokyo-
based Sumitomo said today.  Sumitomo was the closest of Japan’s six major trading
houses to meet their annual profit target. Demand for resources
in  emerging markets  and to rebuild Japan’s northeast after a
record earthquake and tsunami last March bolstered profits for
trading houses, which act as the main metals and energy
suppliers for the nation.  Mitsubishi met 82 percent of its annual profit goal of 450
billion yen after reporting nine-month results on Jan. 31.
 Mitsui & Co ., the second-largest trader, reached 79 percent of
its 430 billion yen target, it said today.  Itochu Corp. (8001)  met 77
percent of its 280 billion yen target, while  Marubeni Corp. (8002) 
reached 83 percent of a 170-billion-yen target today.  Sojitz (2768) , the smallest of Japan’s major traders, revised its
profit target to a 12 billion yen loss on Dec. 9 after a change
in the country’s corporate tax rate. Sojitz yesterday reported a
13.5 billion yen loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
