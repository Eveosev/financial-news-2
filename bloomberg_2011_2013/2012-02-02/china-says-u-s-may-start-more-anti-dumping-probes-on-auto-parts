China (CNGDPYOY) ’s commerce ministry said the
U.S. may start more anti-dumping investigations into Chinese
 exports  of automotive parts after U.S. manufacturers accused the
Asian nation of providing illegal government subsidies.  “Chinese trade associations and companies should watch the
developments closely and make relevant preparations,” the
ministry said in a  statement  on its website today, without being
more specific.  The Alliance for American Manufacturing said Jan. 31 that
about 1.6 million U.S. jobs in the auto-parts industry are
threatened by  China ’s illegal trade practices. The group called
for federal action to protect the recovery for carmakers.  U.S. manufacturers are stepping up their push for action
prior to the Feb. 14 scheduled visit of Chinese Vice President
 Xi Jinping  to  Washington  for meetings with President  Barack Obama  on bilateral and regional issues. Chinese violations of
World Trade Organization rules have contributed to more than
400,000 lost jobs since 2000, according to a report released by
the alliance.  A U.S. appeals court in December rejected the U.S. Commerce
Department’s imposition of duties against China for subsidizing
its tire industry, saying in a ruling that U.S. law doesn’t
allow the department to apply countervailing duties against
products from non-market economies such as China.  Anti-dumping duties apply to goods sold overseas at or
below the price in the home country. Countervailing duties aim
to offset the benefits of government subsidies to industries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
