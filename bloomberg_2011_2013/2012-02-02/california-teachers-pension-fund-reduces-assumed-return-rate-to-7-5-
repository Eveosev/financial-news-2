The California State Teachers’
Retirement System, the second-largest U.S. public pension, cut
its assumed annual rate of return to 7.5 percent from 7.75
percent, the second reduction since 2010.  The board of the $144.8 billion fund voted yesterday to
adopt an actuary’s  recommendation  to lower its investment
forecast because of what a staff report called “dramatic market
declines” beginning in 2008.  The change means the plan will need larger contributions
from taxpayers, teachers, school districts, or a combination of
all three, to cover pension costs. The fund had 71 percent of
what it needs to pay future benefits as of June 30, 2010.
Lowering the rate adds $5.9 billion to its $56 billion
shortfall, according to Milliman Inc., the fund’s consulting
actuary.  “It’s better to err on the side of being conservative,”
said Sharon Hendricks, a Los Angeles community-college
instructor and board member. “I certainly do that with my
personal finances.”  Calstrs posted a 2.3 percent investment gain in 2011,
reducing its ability to meet long-term obligations to 856,000
members and their families. Over the 10 years that ended Dec.
31, the fund gained 5.4 percent, according to a statement.  The Calstrs board last cut its assumed rate from 8 percent
in December 2010, rejecting a staff proposal to make it 7.5
percent. Calstrs ranks second in assets to the  California Public
Employees’ Retirement System . The $229.6 billion fund posted
2011 earnings of 1.1 percent.  Rejected by Calpers  Last March, the Calpers board voted to maintain its 7.75
percent assumed rate, rejecting its actuaries’ recommendation to
lower it to 7.5 percent.  Of the 11 U.S. pension funds with assets of more than $50
billion, Calstrs and systems in  Wisconsin  and  New York  reduced
their assumptions since 2007-08, according to the staff report
to the Calstrs board.  New York City  owes its pensions more than previously
anticipated because officials have been too optimistic in
assuming an 8 percent return on the $115.2 billion that the five
funds hold in assets, Chief Actuary Robert North has said.  A more realistic expectation would be 7 percent, which
would increase the city’s liability by about $2 billion if paid
in one year, North said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
