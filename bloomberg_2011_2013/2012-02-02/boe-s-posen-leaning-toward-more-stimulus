Bank of England Policy makerAdam Posen said he’s leaning toward doing more so-called quantitative
easing.  “I’m certainly leaning toward -- but who knows -- doing
more QE if we don’t change the forecast,” Posen said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television in  London  today.  He added that he was “slightly more optimistic than I was
a few months ago.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
