Gedeon Richter Nyrt. (RICHT) ,  Hungary ’s
biggest drugmaker, jumped to the highest in almost 10 months
after a study confirmed the efficacy of its drug Esmya.  The shares rose 3.7 percent to 38,300 forint by the end of
trade in Budapest, the strongest close since April 8.  Esmya, produced by Richter’s subsidiary PregLem,
“significantly improves symptoms of uterine fibroids
(myomas),” Richter said, citing the results of two studies
published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  “The news should add positive momentum to Richter today,”
