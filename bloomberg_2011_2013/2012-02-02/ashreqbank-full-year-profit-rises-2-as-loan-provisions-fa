Mashreqbank PSC (MASQ) , the United Arab
Emirates lender controlled by the Al Ghurair family, said full-
year profit rose 2 percent as bad-loan provisions dropped.  Net income advanced to 820 million dirhams ($223 million)
from 803 million dirhams a year earlier, the bank said in a
 statement  to the Dubai stock market today. Provisions declined
32 percent to 1.2 billion dirhams.  “The results reflect our policy of balancing prudence with
profitability,” Chief Executive Officer Abdul-Aziz Al Ghurair
said in the statement. “Although 2011 was a challenging year
for the region, we continue to maintain high levels of
capitalization and liquidity and remain fully committed to the
markets across the Gulf Cooperation Council.”  Fourth-quarter profit slumped 59 percent to 64 million
dirhams from 156 million dirhams a year earlier, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on full-year data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
