Turkey will begin measuring
television show ratings, central to determining advertising
fees, in May after halting them temporarily for a probe into
irregularities,  Star newspaper  reported.  The ratings will be taken at 1,040 homes in five provinces
by measurement firm TNS Piyasa Arastirma & Danismanlik Ticaret
AS, Star reported, citing Hidayet Karaca, head of TIAK, a joint
committee of advertisers and television companies. The
measurements will be extended to 3,500 homes in September, the
Istanbul-based newspaper said.  Turkey has gone without official television ratings since
December, when prosecutors opened an investigation into whether
the ratings were corrupted by producers seeking to rig the
results, Star said.  TIAK and RTUK, the state television and radio regulator,
will jointly audit the measurements, Karaca said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
