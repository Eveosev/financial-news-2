Grain exports from the French port of
Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, jumped 76 percent
in the week through yesterday to a seven-week high as  Algeria 
took the most wheat since November.  Outbound grain was 171,966 metric tons between Jan. 26 and
Feb. 1 from 97,645 tons a week earlier, the  Seine River port 
said in an e-mailed report today. Exports included 143,458 tons
of soft wheat, 8,380 tons of durum and 20,128 tons of barley.  Algeria was the biggest export destination, taking 76,500
tons of soft wheat, the most since the week ended Nov. 9,
followed by  Morocco  with 27,5000 tons of soft wheat, 6,600 tons
of durum wheat and 6,600 tons of barley.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s maritime grain
exports in 2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay,
which shipped out 19 percent, according to figures from national
