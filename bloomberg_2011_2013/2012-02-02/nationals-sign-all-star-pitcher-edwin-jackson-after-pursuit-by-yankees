The Washington Nationals agreed to
contract terms with right-handed pitcher  Edwin Jackson , a former
All-Star who had been in talks with the  New York Yankees .  Jackson, 28, will join the Nationals on a one-year contract
provided he passes a physical, the team said today on its
website. Jackson and his agent met with the Yankees last month,
according to the New York Post.  Financial terms of the contract werenâ€™t disclosed  Jackson is 60-60 with a 4.46 earned-run average and 801
strikeouts in a nine-year career with six teams. In 2010, he
threw a no-hitter with the Arizona Diamondbacks, and last year
went 1-1 in four playoff starts for the World Series-champion
St. Louis Cardinals.  The Nationals were 80-81 last season, finishing third in
the  National League East . The team acquired left-handed pitcher
Gio Gonzalez in a trade with the Oakland Athletics in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
