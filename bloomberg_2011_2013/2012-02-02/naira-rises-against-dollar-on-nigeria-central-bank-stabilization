Nigeria ’s naira advanced against the
dollar for a third day after the central bank of Africa’s top
crude producer said it favoured a stable currency.  The naira strengthened 0.3 percent to 160.65 per dollar as
of 11:17 a.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The West African nation isn’t under pressure to devalue the
naira again after lowering its band against the dollar last
year, Central Bank of Nigeria Governor Lamido Sanusi said
yesterday. The bank kept its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged
at a record high for a second consecutive meeting Jan. 31 and
Sanusi said he favors a stable  exchange rate  while building up
reserves.  “So far the CBN’s extraordinary measures have been
effective at stabilizing the naira and reserves are showing more
convincing signs of having reached a bottom,”  Alan Cameron , an
economist at CSL Stockbrokers Ltd. in London, wrote in an e-
mailed note to clients today.  The foreign-exchange reserves of Africa’s most populous
nation have risen 4.5 percent this year to $34.4 billion as of
Jan. 27, according to Central Bank of Nigeria data.  Ghana’s cedi weakened for a third day, dropping 0.1 percent
to 1.6831 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
