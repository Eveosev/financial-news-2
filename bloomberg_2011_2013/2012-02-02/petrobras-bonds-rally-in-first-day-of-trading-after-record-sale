controlled oil producer sold the securities as part of a record
$7 billion overseas offering.  Petrobras’s $1.25 billion of 2.875 percent notes due
February 2015 yielded 206 basis points more than U.S. Treasuries

yesterday’s sale, according to Trace, the bond price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The
