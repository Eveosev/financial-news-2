Hungary ’s ability to agree with the
European Union on a contested judiciary reform is just as
important as amending the criticized central bank law for
financial aid talks to begin, Morgan Stanley economists said.  “While a compromise on the central bank act seems fairly
easy to reach, in our view” the “judiciary issue is as
important,” economists Pasquale Diana and Mihail Bozinov wrote
in a report today from  London .  Hungary is seeking to revive bailout talks with the EU and
the International Monetary Organization, which broke down last
year after the government passed a central bank law that the 27-
member bloc said threatens monetary policy independence. Hungary
faces infringement procedures by the European Union over laws on
the central bank, the judiciary and the data protection agency.  The government has so far refused to amend legislation
stipulating that judges must retire at the age of 62 years,
versus 70 previously, which the EU says is discriminatory.  “Given the rising tension in Brussels regarding the
government, the European Commission is likely using this
opportunity to exert as much pressure on Hungary as possible,”
according to the report.  A deal with the two institutions is “well within reach”
once Hungary resolves its issues with the EU, with an agreement
likely by April, the economists said.  A “sizable” credit line of as much as 20 billion euros
($26 billion) would allow the central bank to lower  interest
rates  by at least 100 basis points by end-2012, Morgan Stanley
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
