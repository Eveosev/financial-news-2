The following is the text of the
U.S. productivity and costs report for the fourth quarter
released by the Labor Department.  Nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased at a
0.7 percent annual rate during the fourth quarter of 2011, the
 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today. The gain in
productivity reflects increases of 3.6 percent in output and
2.9 percent in hours worked. (All quarterly percent changes in
this release are seasonally adjusted annual rates.) From the
fourth quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2011,
productivity grew 0.5 percent, as output rose 2.3 percent and
hours rose 1.8 percent.  Annual average productivity increased
0.7 percent from 2010 to 2011.  Labor productivity, or output per hour, is calculated by
dividing an index of real output by an index of hours worked
of all persons, including employees, proprietors, and unpaid
family workers.  Unit labor costs in nonfarm businesses increased 1.2
percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, as productivity grew at
a slower rate (0.7 percent) than hourly compensation (1.9
percent). Unit labor costs rose 1.3 percent over the last four
quarters. Annual average unit labor costs increased 1.2
percent from 2010 to 2011.  BLS defines unit labor costs as the ratio of hourly
compensation to  labor productivity ; increases in hourly
compensation tend to increase unit labor costs and increases
in output per hour tend to reduce them.  Manufacturing sector productivity declined 0.4 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2011, as output rose 3.8 percent and
hours worked increased 4.2 percent; this is the largest
quarterly gain in hours worked since the fourth quarter of
2005 (4.8 percent). Over the last four quarters, manufacturing
productivity increased 1.7 percent. Annual average
productivity grew 2.8 percent from 2010 to 2011. Unit labor
costs in manufacturing increased 1.6 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2011 but decreased 1.1 percent from the same
quarter a year ago.  The data sources and methods used in the preparation of
the manufacturing output series differ from those used in
preparing the business and nonfarm business output series, and
these measures are not directly comparable. See Technical
Notes for further information on data sources.  Nonfarm business sector productivity grew 0.7 percent in
2011, as output and hoursincreased 2.4 percent and 1.7
percent, respectively. The increase in hours worked is the
first annual increase in the measure since 2007. Because
productivity grew more slowly than hourly compensation (1.9
percent), unit labor costs rose in 2011(1.2 percent). Real
hourly compensation, which takes into account changes in
consumer prices, fell 1.2 percent in 2011--the largest decline
in the annual series since a 1.7 percent decline in 1989.  In the manufacturing sector, productivity grew 2.8
percent in 2011, reflecting a 4.9 percent increase in output
combined with a 2.0 percent increase in hours; this is the
largest annual increase in manufacturing sector hours since a
2.3 percent gain in 1994. Unit labor costs in the
manufacturing sector fell 1.3 percent in 2011.  Revised measures  Revised and previous measures for the third quarter of
2011 are shown in tables B and D and cover the following major
sectors: nonfarm business, business, manufacturing, and
nonfinancial corporations. Measures for the nonfinancial
corporate sector include historically revised gross product of
nonfinancial corporate business in chained (2005) dollars,
published December 22, 2011 by the  Bureau of Economic Analysis 
of the U.S. Department of Commerce.  In the third quarter of 2011, nonfarm business
productivity growth was 1.9 percent, reflecting a downward
revision to output and a slight upward revision to hours. (See
table B.) Unit labor costs for the nonfarm business sector
fell 2.1 percent in the third quarter, less than previously
reported.  In the nonfinancial corporate (NFC) sector, quarterly
percent changes in productivity and unit labor costs were not
revised for the third quarter, although indexes for these and
other measures related to output were revised historically.  Effective with this release, measures for the NFC sector,
previously beginning in 1958, have been extended back to 1947.
These newly-introduced data for the pre-1958 period are based
upon the same methodology and data sources as those for 1958
forward. Nonfinancial corporate sector productivity grew at a
2.4 percent average annual rate from 1947 to 2010.  Quarterly and annual data for all sectors from 2009 to
2011 appear in tables 1-6 and revised historical annual data
for the nonfinancial corporate sector in appendix table 1.
Full historical measures can be found on the productivity and
costs home page at  http://www.bls.gov/lpc/#data .  The revised Productivity and Costs press release for the
fourth quarter 2011 is scheduled to be released on Wednesday,
March 7, 2012 at 8:30 a.m. (EST).  Data in this release do not reflect the annual benchmark
revision of the BLS Current Employment Statistics program data
to be released February 3, 2012. This benchmark will be
incorporated in our next release on March 7, 2012
