Alexandre Tombini, president of Banco
Central do Brasil, speaks on the central bank’s monetary policy
goals. He spoke to reporters in Mumbai today.  “We have been very active in  Brazil  as far as policy to
fight inflation in 2011 is concerned. We had excessive demand at
the beginning of the year and we had multiple shocks to deal
with.  ‘‘Our goal is to bring inflation to 4.5 percent target in
2012 and that is what guides the monetary policy.  ‘‘We had to put together a broad set of policies, including
a tightening of 175 basis points between January and July.
Consumer price inflation expectations are in the order of 5.3
percent for 2012. Our projection is close to 4.7 percent.  ‘‘The economy may have grown around 3 percent, the final
figure is yet to come, after growing at around 7.5 percent. The
last two quarters have been below potential growth. This has
opened up space for us to implement policies since August, when
we started an easing cycle.  ‘‘We don’t have an optimum level of foreign exchange
reserves. It is an elusive concept. We have some buffer in our
capacity to deal with different international environments.  Our
reserves, compared to the size of the economy, are on a moderate
threshold.  ‘‘We have signaled that the monetary easing cycle has not
finished. We are in a different environment today than we were
at the start of 2011, so we have some room to reduce rates.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
