Frontier Agriculture Ltd. , a joint
venture of Cargill Inc. and  Associated British Foods Plc (ABF) , bought
U.K. farm adviser The Agronomy Partnership for an undisclosed
price to expand in advisory services.  The purchase will add to its team of 95 agronomists, Witham
St. Hughes, England-based Frontier said in a statement on its
website today. The grain and fertilizer trader said it
demonstrated a “strong desire” in the past two years to add to
its crop-protection and agronomy business.  The U.K. is the European Union’s third-largest wheat
producer and the 27-nation bloc’s fourth-biggest grower of
rapeseed and sugar beets. TAP is located in the southeastern
English county of Kent. The county provides most of the
strawberries served at Wimbledon,  according  to the annual Grand
Slam tennis tournament’s website.  “The company sees Kent as an area with great potential for
the growth of agronomy services,” Frontier said.  Cargill, based in  Minneapolis , is the commodity trader
that’s the biggest closely held U.S. company. AB Foods, located
in  London , has activities that include buying grain from farmers
and selling  animal feed  to them as well as making sugar in
plants located from the U.K. to China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
