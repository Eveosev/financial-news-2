Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the largest
construction and mining equipment maker, said the business cycle
is in the early stages of a recovery and the company expects to
see a “tail wind” from U.S. and European demand.  “We are just two years into it,” Chief Financial Officer
Ed Rapp said today in an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters
in  New York . “If you go back into history, our cycle is six,
seven years.”  Caterpillar said last week 2011 profit and sales jumped and
its order backlog reached a record $29.8 billion at year-end as
demand for some products outpaced manufacturing capacity. Orders
from customers replacing older equipment has yet to match the
last peak in regions including the U.S., which is Peoria,
Illinois-based Caterpillar’s largest  market .  “That catch-up in demand, that replacement cycle in the
U.S. and  Europe , is going to play out,” Rapp said. That
“tailwind is going to be there.”  Caterpillar has focused on investing early in the global
economic recovery, he said. The company roughly has spent about
$20 billion on capacity expansions, research and development and
 acquisitions  such as Bucyrus International Inc. over the last
two years, he said.  Caterpillar forecasts global economic growth of 3.3 percent
in 2012, up from 2.8 percent last year. The U.S. will expand
more than 3 percent, the company forecast Jan. 26 when it
published its fourth-quarter earnings.  Tax Uncertainty  U.S. consumption of heavy-duty construction and mining
vehicles used in earth moving rose 12 percent last year and 21
in 2010, after plunging 58 percent in 2009, according to  data 
from Manfredi & Associates.  “The opportunity is there for more growth,” Rapp said.
“The thing that impedes our customers today is just general
business confidence,” given uncertainty about U.S. taxes and
government infrastructure spending, he said.  Rapp, 54, joined Caterpillar as a pricing analyst in 1979
and became CFO in 2010. He said he’s worked through four
recessions. In 2009, when the last U.S. contraction was still
happening,  sales  tumbled 37 percent as construction slowed and
commodity prices collapsed.  Caterpillar said last week 2012 earnings will rise 25
percent to about $9.25 a share, meaning the company will meet
its target of $8 to $10 first set in 2009.  Profit Target  “Most of the people in the audience had a doubting eye”
when the target was first announced 2 1/2 years ago, Rapp said.  The company said it aims to more than double profit over
the next three years, to $15 to $20 a share in 2015.  While Caterpillar may see opportunities for so-called bolt-
on acquisitions, most of its growth will be organic as the
company builds factories in countries including the U.S.,  China ,
 Indonesia  and  Thailand , Rapp said. Caterpillar’s expansion will
lead to further hiring, he said. Not including acquisitions, the
company’s global workforce grew by more than 14,000 in 2011.
Caterpillar had 125,099 full-time  employees  globally as of Dec.
31.  Caterpillar bought Bucyrus in July for $8.8 billion
including debt to add shovels and drills to its product range.
It also agreed in November to buy Hong Kong-based ERA Mining
Machinery Ltd. for as much as HK$6.89 billion ($890 million).  Caterpillar dropped 0.2 percent to $110.33 in New York. The
shares have advanced 11 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
