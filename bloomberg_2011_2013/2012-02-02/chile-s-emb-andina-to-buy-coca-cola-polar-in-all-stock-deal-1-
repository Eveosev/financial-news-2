Embotelladora Andina SA (AKO/A) ,  Chile ’s
largest  Coca-Cola (KO)  bottler, will take over rival Embotelladora
Coca-Cola Polar SA in an all-stock transaction agreed to by the
two companies’ controllers.  Andina will swap 0.33 new share for each existing Coca-Cola
Polar share, giving the latter’s shareholders 20 percent of the
combined company, under a memorandum of understanding signed by
the controllers, according to a statement posted on the
securities regulator’s website.  The transaction would create one of Latin America’s biggest
Coca-Cola bottlers, with operations in  Argentina , Brazil, Chile
and Paraguay and sales of $2.56 billion, according to the
statement.  The two companies’ controllers are scheduled to sign a
merger contract by March 15, they said in the statement. The
transaction is subject to regulatory approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
