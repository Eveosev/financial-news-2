Government departments aren’t
properly prepared to slash budgets by almost a fifth by 2015,
even though they hit their targets during the first year of
Britain’s austerity program, the spending watchdog said.  The National Audit Office said ministries don’t fully
understand the costs and risks involved and that “fundamental
changes” will be required to achieve cuts of 19 percent planned
by the Treasury. Spending was reduced by 2.3 percent, or 7.9
billion pounds ($12.5 billion), in the year through March 2010,
with half of that achieved by providing fewer services.  “Most departments will need to cut their spending by much
more over the next four years,” Amyas Morse, the head of the
NAO, said in a statement in  London  today. “This will not be
possible without their recognizing that short-term measures are
not enough and that fundamental changes are needed.”  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  is aiming to rid
Britain of a  budget deficit  equal to 9 percent of gross domestic
product by 2017. His 147 billion-pound austerity program will
cost more than 700,000 government jobs. Critics including the
opposition  Labour Party  say the scale of the squeeze is
worsening Britain’s economic woes.  “Departments must look to deliver services in radically
more efficient ways and not simply cut front-line services,”
 Margaret Hodge , a lawmaker from the Labour Party who also heads
Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee, said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
