Bank of Nova Scotia  fell as much as
2.4 percent after Canada’s third-largest bank agreed to sell 30
million shares for C$1.51 billion ($1.51 billion) to bolster
regulatory capital and finance acquisitions.  The Toronto-based bank declined 46 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to close at C$51.38 in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange
after falling as low as $50.60, the biggest  drop  since Dec. 2.  Scotiabank said yesterday after markets closed that the
sale of shares for C$50.25 each will help increase capital ahead
of new Basel Committee on Banking Supervision standards that
take effect in January. At the end of October, Scotiabank had a
Tier 1 equity ratio of 12.2 percent, the second-lowest among
 Canada ’s five biggest banks. Tier 1 is the bank’s ratio of
capital to risk-weighted assets.  “Completion of the announced equity issue removes a
significant overhang” to Scotiabank’s common share valuation,
said  Brad Smith , an analyst at Stonecap Securities Inc. in
Toronto.  Scotiabank, which has operations in more than 50 countries,
has spent more than C$3.5 billion in the past five years on
 acquisitions  outside Canada, including China, Thailand and
Colombia.  The lender said last month it may sell its Toronto office
tower headquarters, which would allow it to raise additional
capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
