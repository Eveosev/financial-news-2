The  Reserve Bank  of India may
consider purchasing dollars to ease a shortage of liquidity in
the banking system in addition to buying government securities,
Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said in an interview.  “To the extent that pressure remains, we are always open
to carrying out further open market operations,” Gokarn said.
“The other form of liquidity infusion is to buy up dollars. If
circumstances are right, we’ll certainly consider it. When we’ll
have those circumstances is difficult to say.”  Lenders’ borrowing from the monetary authority averaged 1.3
trillion rupees this week, more than double the 600 billion
rupees “comfort zone” indicated by the Reserve Bank at its
policy review on Jan. 24. The RBI has bought 719 billion rupees
of notes since November to ease a cash squeeze in the banking
system.  The central bank on Jan. 24 reduced the  cash reserve ratio 
by 50 basis points to 5.5 percent from 6 percent to tackle the
shortage of liquidity in the banking system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
