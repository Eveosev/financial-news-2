More migrants left  New Zealand  than
arrived for the ninth month in the past 10, extending the
biggest exodus in a decade, after residents were uprooted by an
earthquake in the South Island city of Christchurch.  Permanent departures  exceeded  arrivals by 520 in December,
 Statistics New Zealand  said in Wellington today. There were
1,855 net departures in the 12 months through December, up from
568 in the year ended Nov. 30.  Christchurch was devastated by a Feb. 22 temblor that
killed 181 people, wrecked homes and closed many businesses in
the nation’s second-largest city. Falling migration adds to
signs New Zealand’s economy isn’t able to match the job
opportunities and wages of many overseas nations including
 Australia .  Departures of New Zealand citizens rose 30 percent in 2011,
with those headed to Australia surging 43 percent to a record,
today’s report showed.  Short-term visitor arrivals increased 5.4 percent from
December 2010, the report showed. Arrivals in the year ended
Dec. 31 rose 3 percent from the year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
