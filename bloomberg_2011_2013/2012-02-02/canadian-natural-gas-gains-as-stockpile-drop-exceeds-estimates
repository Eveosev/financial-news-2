Canadian natural gas rose after a
government report showed that U.S. inventories fell more than
analysts expected.  Alberta  gas gained 9.3 percent. U.S. stockpiles decreased
132 billion cubic feet to 2.966 trillion last week, the Energy
Department said today. Inventories had been expected to fall 129
billion, the median of analyst estimates compiled by  Bloomberg (DOENUSCH) .  “It was a surprise to some,” said Eric Bickel, a natural
gas analyst at Summit Energy Services in Louisville,  Kentucky ,
who had estimated a decline of 135 billion cubic feet. “It’s
giving the market some hope that there’s demand out there.”  Alberta gas for March delivery rose 18.25 cents to C$2.155
a gigajoule ($2.05 per million British thermal units) at 3:15
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas
has lost 25 percent this year.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  gained 17.2 cents, or 7.2 percent, to settle at $2.554
per million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago rose
3.25 cents to $2.4972 per million Btu on the  Intercontinental
Exchange . Alliance, an express line, can carry 1.5 billion cubic
feet a day to the Midwest from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas slipped 0.38 cent to $2.3416, according to ICE. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas gained 0.25 cent to $2.4684.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.7 billion cubic
feet, 138 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.49 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta. The fuel is transferred to TransCanada’s
main line at Empress.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.3 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 513 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.93 billion cubic feet today, or 79 percent of its
capacity of 2.44 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.02
billion cubic feet at 1:22 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
