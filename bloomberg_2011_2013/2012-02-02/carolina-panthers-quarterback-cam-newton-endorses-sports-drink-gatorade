Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton signed a multiyear agreement to endorse  Pepsico (PEP)  Inc.’s
sports drink Gatorade.  Newton, 22, a Heisman Trophy winner as the top player in
college football and the No. 1 pick in the 2011 National
Football League draft, will promote the importance of sports
nutrition to other athletes. Details of the sponsorship deal
were not released.  Newton, a 2012 Pro Bowl selection, also will work with
scientists from the Gatorade Sports Science Institute to find
ways of improving his performance on the field. The Panthers
went 6-10 in his rookie season.  “Working with Gatorade fulfills a childhood dream of
mine,” Newton said in a statement released yesterday by the
company. “Gatorade provides me the opportunity to work with the
world’s leading scientists, who can help me gain a competitive
edge and play at my best.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
