The rand strengthened to a four-month
high as stocks extended a rally after data showed an expansion
in manufacturing across the globe and slowing unemployment in
the U.S., boosting demand for riskier assets.  South Africa ’s currency appreciated as much as 0.6 percent,
a third day of gains, to 7.6443 per dollar, the strongest since
Sept. 20. It traded less than 0.1 percent up from yesterday’s
New York close at 7.6864 as of 3:44 p.m. in Johannesburg.  Claims for U.S. jobless benefits fell last week, a Labor
Department report showed today, a sign the labor market is
improving. U.S. manufacturing grew at the fastest pace since
June, a report showed yesterday. The U.K.’s factory measure
unexpectedly reached an eight-month high, and manufacturing
gauges in South Africa,  Europe ,  China  and India rose in January.  The data showed that “the global economy entered 2012 on a
much better footing,”  John Cairns  and Josina Solomons, analysts
at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, wrote in e-mailed
comments. “Risk-on is the result” and “the rand has responded
with further gains,” they added.  A gauge of  emerging-market stocks  headed to its highest
level since August, and South Africa’s benchmark stock  index 
rose to a record. Raw materials exporters including Anglo
American Plc and BHP Billiton Ltd. led the advance.  South Africa’s 6.75 percent bonds due 2021 gained for a
third day, driving the yield down four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 7.65 percent, the lowest since Sept. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
