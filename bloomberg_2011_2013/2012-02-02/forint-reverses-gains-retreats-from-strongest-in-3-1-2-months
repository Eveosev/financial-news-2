Hungary’s forint reversed an earlier
gain, retreating from its strongest intraday level against the
euro in 3 1/2 months.  The forint depreciated 0.4 percent to 291.66 per euro as of
10:09 a.m. in Budapest. The Hungarian currency earlier advanced
as much as 0.4 percent to 289.40, its strongest since Oct. 13.  A rally of 8.4 percent against the euro this year through
yesterday lifted the 14-day relative strength index for forint-
euro to 72 at yesterday’s close. Readings above 70 suggest to
technical analysts an asset may drop. The RSI last traded at 68.  To contact the reporter on this story:
