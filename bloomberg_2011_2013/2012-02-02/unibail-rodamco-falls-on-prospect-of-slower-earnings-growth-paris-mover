Unibail-Rodamco SE (UL) ,  Europe ’s largest
publicly traded property company, fell the most in almost a
month in Paris after projecting slower growth in recurring
earnings per share than some analysts had expected.  The shares dropped as much as 2.7 percent. Earnings
excluding changes in the value of properties and interest-rate
derivatives will rise 4 percent this year from 9.03 euros
($11.86) a share last year, the Paris-based company said after
the market closed yesterday. This was slower than the 5 percent
to 7 percent annual growth the company predicted for 2012
through 2014, Jefferies International said in a note to
investors today.  Inflation, rising taxes and mounting unemployment across
Europe are causing shoppers to cut spending, making retailers
less willing to lease space. That’s acting as a brake on higher
rents charged by landlords like Unibail-Rodamco for its large
dominant malls.  The forecast was “disappointing,” Cheuvreux analysts said
today in a morning note to investors in which they cut their
rating to “underperform” from the broker’s “selected list.”
Paris-based Cheuvreux had expected the company’s earnings to
increase 6 percent this year.  Unibail-Rodamco fell 3.90 euros, or 2.6 percent, to 146.90
euros at 11:50 a.m. in Paris, reducing the company’s market
value to 13.5 billion euros. That’s the biggest decline since
