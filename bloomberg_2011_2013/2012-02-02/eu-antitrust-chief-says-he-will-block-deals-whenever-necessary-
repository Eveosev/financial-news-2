The day after blocking the merger of
 NYSE Euronext (NYX)  and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) , the European Union’s
antitrust chief vowed to veto other deals that hamper
competition.  The EU will continue to block deals “whenever necessary,”
 Joaquin Almunia  said in prepared remarks for a speech in
Brussels today.  The deal to create the world’s largest exchange would have
created a “near-monopoly” that could have increased trading fees
and prevented investors switching from exchange-traded to over-
the-counter derivatives, Almunia said.  Offers from the companies to soothe EU antitrust concerns
were “too limited,” he said. “I rarely have to propose the
prohibition of a merger,” said Almunia. “This means that I do
not do so lightly; but I have done and will continue to do so
whenever necessary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
