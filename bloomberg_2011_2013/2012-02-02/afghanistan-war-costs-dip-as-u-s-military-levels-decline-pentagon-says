The Pentagon’s monthly  spending  in
 Afghanistan  dipped to $5.3 billion in October and November, down
from an average of $7.8 billion a month in the fiscal year that
ended in September, according to data compiled by the Defense
Department comptroller’s office.  The drop reflects savings as U.S. military levels in
Afghanistan decline. The U.S. stationed 98,000 troops there in
October and 97,000 troops in November. There are 89,000 today,
as the U.S. continues to draw down from the surge of 33,000
troops President  Barack Obama  approved in late 2009. An
additional 23,000 troops are to be removed by September.  Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta , attending his second
Brussels meeting of NATO defense ministers since taking office
last July, told reporters traveling with him Feb. 1 that the
U.S.-led coalition would shift primarily to advising Afghan
forces in 2013 as part of a transition to ending its primary
combat role by 2014.  The U.S. still plans to keep some troops in Afghanistan
after 2014 to conduct counter-terrorism missions and advise
Afghan forces, Panetta said.  U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan reached a high of 100,000
in August 2010 and in March through May 2011. In November 2008,
when Obama won the presidency, the U.S. had roughly 30,800
personnel in the country.  Each added soldier in Afghanistan may cost $1 million a
year, according to an estimate by  Peter Orszag  when he was
Obama’s budget director.  The Pentagon has obligated more than $1 trillion from
September 2001 through Nov. 30 for war-related costs. The
expenditures included $714.5 billion for  Iraq  and $352.3 billion
for Afghanistan, according to the newly compiled figures by the
Pentagon comptroller.  To contact the reporter on this story:
