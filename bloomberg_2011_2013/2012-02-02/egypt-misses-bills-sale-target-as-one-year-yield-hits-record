Egypt  missed the target on a sale of
debt for the fourth straight auction today, raising about 4
billion pounds ($663 million) out of 6.5 billion pounds it
sought as government borrowings strain banks.  The  finance ministry  sold 2.036 billion pounds of six-month
bills at an average yield of 14.894 percent, three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, below the previous sale of similar
maturity securities, according to central bank data on
Bloomberg. The ministry also sold 1.98 billion pounds of one-
year notes at a record average yield of 15.91 percent, the data
show.  Egypt’s borrowing costs surged to all-time highs after
foreign investors dumped local assets following last year’s
revolt that ousted President Hosni Mubarak, leaving domestic
banks to bear the brunt of government financing. The finance
ministry raised 31 percent less than it had targeted at auctions
of treasury bills and bonds last month.  “There is a lack of liquidity in Egyptian pounds,”
Moustafa Assal, director of fixed-income at Cairo-based  Beltone
Financial Holding (BTFH) , said in a telephone interview before the
sale. “It’s totally normal that the yield will increase. If the
Ministry of Finance refuses these levels, there will be no
buyers anymore.”  The central bank started offering seven-day  repurchase
agreements  in March to allow holders of  government securities  to
sell them back to the regulator to access funds for a week. The
central bank sold its 12 billion-pound offering of repos this
week.  The pound fell 0.1 percent to 6.0335 a dollar. The yield on
Egypt’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due April 2020 was little
changed at 6.98 percent at 4:14 p.m. in Cairo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
