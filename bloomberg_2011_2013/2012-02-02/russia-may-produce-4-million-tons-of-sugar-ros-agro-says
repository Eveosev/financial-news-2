Russian production of sugar from
beets may fall to 4 million metric tons in the coming marketing
year, said Maxim Basov, chief executive officer of Ros Agro Plc.  National output after the 2012-13 season starting Aug. 1
will keep pace with the average annual rate of between 4 million
and 4.4 million tons, he said today in an interview in Moscow,
where the company is based. Production in the current period of
5 million tons stemmed from favorable weather and made  Russia 
the world’s biggest maker of sugar from beets, the CEO said.  Imports of raw sugar into Russia will be no higher than
500,000 tons in the current marketing year, Basov said. He
predicted inbound shipments would climb to between 1 million and
1.5 million tons in the coming period and afterward.  Ros Agro’s global depositary receipts fell 5.1 percent to
$6.50 by 3:40 p.m. in London trading, reducing the company’s
market value to $780 million. The securities cost $15 each when
 Ros Agro (AGRO) , which produces sugar and grains, first sold them in
April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
