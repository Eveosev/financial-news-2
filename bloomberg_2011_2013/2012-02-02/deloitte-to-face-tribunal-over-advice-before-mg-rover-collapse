The U.K. accounting regulator issued
a complaint against Deloitte LLP for failing to “consider the
public interest” while advising on transactions involving the
now defunct U.K. car company MG Rover Group Ltd.  The conduct of Deloitte, and a former partner, “fell short
of the standards reasonably to be expected,” the  Accountancy &
Actuarial Discipline Board  said in an e-mailed statement. The
firm didn’t consider “the conflicts of interest and self-
interest” in advising both the car company and its parent
company, called Phoenix Venture Holdings. The matter was
referred to an independent tribunal.  “We do not agree with the AADB and are confident that when
all the evidence is considered, the tribunal will conclude that
there is no justification for criticism of either Deloitte or
our former partner,” Deloitte said in an e-mailed statement.  MG Rover went bankrupt in 2005 with 1.3 billion pounds
($2.1 billion) of debt and around 6,000 people lost their jobs.
Nanjing Automobile Group Corp., a state-owned Chinese
Company, bought the assets of MG Rover in July of that year for
about $97 million.  The AADB last month secured a record fine of 1.4 million
pounds over PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP failures concerning
reports on client-money accounts at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. ’s
London securities unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
