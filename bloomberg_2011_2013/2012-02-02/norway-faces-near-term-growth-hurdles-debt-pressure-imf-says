Norway ’s mainland economic output
will stay close to potential as inflation and unemployment
remains low, the International Monetary Fund said, citing risks
from falling oil prices and slowing housing demand.  Economic growth in the mainland, which excludes oil and gas
production and shipping, will “remain near potential and grow
at about 2.75 percent in 2013 and throughout the medium term,”
the Washington-based group said today.  Norway, western Europe’s biggest oil exporter, has been
shielded from the worst of the debt crisis as its crude revenue
generates surpluses and unemployment remains close to 3 percent.
The central bank has kept interest rates unchanged for more than
a year, after cutting them twice to weaken the krone, and has
estimated it will again need to tighten policy next year.  Monetary policy is appropriate and a tightening “might
help cool housing markets, but at the cost of likely exchange
rate appreciation and additional pressure on the non-oil-related
sectors of the mainland economy,” the IMF said.  The group also said that Norway faces risk from a
substantial drop in oil prices as well as a “significant
reduction in home prices” because of high levels of household
debt. It recommended the government also use less of its oil
wealth to plug deficits “in the light of the wage pressures and
other competitiveness concerns.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
