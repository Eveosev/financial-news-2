Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. (5405) 
forecast a third year of losses after an affiliate took charges
to reorganize itself and asked  Japan ’s third-largest steelmaker
for support.  Sumitomo Metal  will probably have a loss of 55 billion yen
($722 million) for the financial year ending March 31, the
company said today in a statement. In October the company
estimated it would break even for the year.  Sumitomo Metal, which is also Japan’s biggest producer of
seamless pipes used in oil and gas extraction, today reported a
 loss  of 37.7 billion yen for the nine months to Dec. 31,
compared with a profit of 34.9 billion yen a year earlier. Sumco
Corp., a silicon wafer maker, forecast a full-year loss of 85
billion yen and asked Sumitomo Metal, which owns a 28 percent
stake, to buy preferred shares. Sumco took a charge of 58.2
billion yen.  The company is preparing to merge with  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) 
on Oct. 1 to create the world’s second-biggest steelmaker and
meet competition from Chinese and South Korean rivals.  Nippon Steel, Japan’s largest steelmaker, last week cut its
full-year profit target to zero.  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) , the second-
biggest, forecast its first annual loss since it was created
from the merger of Kawasaki Steel Corp. and NKK Corp. in 2002.
 Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406) , ranked fourth, yesterday forecast a 20 billion
yen loss this fiscal year, the first in three years.  Sumitomo Metal rose 2 percent to 1,120 yen on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, compared with an 0.8 percent gain in the
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
