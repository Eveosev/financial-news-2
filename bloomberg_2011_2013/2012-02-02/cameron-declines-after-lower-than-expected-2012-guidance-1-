Cameron International Corp. (CAM) , the
second-largest U.S. maker of oilfield equipment, declined after
forecasting first-quarter and 2012 earnings will be less than
analysts’ estimates.  Cameron  fell  1.7 percent to $53.22 at the close in  New
York . The Houston-based company expects per-share earnings this
year to be $3.20 to $3.30, excluding charges, and 50 cents to 55
cents for the first quarter, it said in a statement today.  Cameron had been expected to earn $3.53 a share this year
on an adjusted basis, according to the average of 31 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. First-quarter average earnings
would be 76 cents, according to 23 estimates.  “The smaller projects in the backlog will take a bit
longer and there’s a challenging environment in  North America 
onshore right now,” Jeff Spittel, a Houston-based analyst at
Global Hunter Securities LLC, said in a phone interview today.
Spittel, who has a “buy” rating and doesn’t own the shares,
yesterday predicted the lower 2012 earnings.  Cameron today reported fourth-quarter net income declined
to $99.9 million, or 40 cents a share, from $164.6 million, or
66 cents, a year earlier.  National Oilwell Varco Inc. is the largest U.S. maker of
oilfield equipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
