National Football League owners
approved a $200 million loan that will help cover construction
costs for the  San Francisco  49ers’ proposed $1 billion Silicon
Valley stadium.  The 49ers are the first NFL franchise to receive support
from a new stadium fund included in the collective bargaining
agreement signed last year by owners and players. Approval of
the loan came yesterday at an NFL owners meeting in
Indianapolis.  “With the NFL’s muscle now behind the new stadium, we are
moving forward,” 49ers Chief Executive Officer Jed York said in
a statement released by the team. “I expect an official
groundbreaking ceremony very soon.”  The 49ers said the new 68,500-seat stadium in Santa Clara,
 California , will cost about $1 billion. York said in a
conference call last month that he expects the stadium to debut
for the 2015 NFL season.  In December, the  Santa Clara  Stadium Authority unanimously
approved an $850 million construction loan for the stadium.
Santa Clara voters approved a ballot measure in June 2010 that
authorized the city to lease land for a stadium next to the
Great America amusement park.  The 49ers now play their home games at 51-year-old
 Candlestick Park , where power failures led to two delays of a
Monday Night Football game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in
December. Santa Clara is about 45 miles south of San Francisco.  “Today’s vote is an important milestone for the 49ers and
their fans,” NFL Commissioner  Roger Goodell  said in a statement
released yesterday by the 49ers.  “This step will allow the
49ers to move forward toward making the dream of a new stadium a
reality.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
