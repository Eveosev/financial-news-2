U.K.  government bonds  advanced,
pushing 10-year yields down from the highest in almost a week,
as investors sought the safest assets after U.K. construction
output slowed to the weakest in four months in January.  Shorter-dated securities led gains as Britain auctioned
1.25 billion pounds ($1.98 billion) of inflation-linked debt due
March 2029. Gilts also rose as Italian and Spanish debt declined
for the first time in three days. The pound traded within 0.4
percent of a 10-week high against the dollar.  ‘The weaker figure today might have had a little bit of an
impact’’ on gilts, said  Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income analyst
at Investec Capital Markets in London, referring to the building
data. “There seems to be a little bit of a widening in the
peripherals, after a very strong performance over the past
couple of days. The U.K. is benefiting from that.”  Two-year note yields fell as much as three basis points to
0.37 percent and were at 0.39 percent at 11:03 a.m.  London  time.
The 2.25 percent security due March 2014 rose 0.025, or 25 pence
per 1,000 pound face amount to 103.88. Benchmark 10-year bond
yields slipped to 2.04 percent, after reaching 2.06 percent, the
highest since Jan. 27.  The gauge of building activity based on a survey of
 purchasing managers  fell to 51.4 last month from 53.2 in
December, Markit and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply  in London said in a report. The median forecast of nine
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was 52.5. A reading above
50 indicates expansion.  Gilt Returns  Gilts handed investors a loss of 0.2 percent so far this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
government bonds have returned 7.4 percent, while Spanish debt
has gained 3 percent.  The U.K. Treasury sold the 0.125 percent inflation-linked
debt maturing in 2029 at an average yield of minus 0.188
percent. The auction attracted bids of 2.27 times the securities
offered.  The pound traded at $1.5825, after yesterday climbing to as
high as $1.5883, the strongest level since Nov. 18. It was also
little changed at 83.07 pence per euro.  Sterling has dropped 0.7 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar declined 2.6 percent and
the euro fell 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
