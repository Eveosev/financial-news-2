Residual-fuel (SPIVRESD)  inventories in
 Singapore , Asia’s largest oil-trading and storage center,
climbed 8.7 percent to the highest in more than four months,
according to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen increased 1.58 million barrels in
the week to yesterday to 19.71 million,  International Enterprise
Singapore  said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the
highest since the seven days ended Sept. 28.  Light-distillate (SPIVLDIS)  inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate dropped 1.1 million barrels, or 9.9 percent, to
9.96 million. That’s the biggest decline in 12 weeks.  Supplies of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or diesel,
and kerosene were up 61,000 barrels, or 0.7 percent, at 8.99
million, based on the ministry’s data. That’s the first gain in
three weeks.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
