The Netherlands’ sugar-beet harvest,
the fifth-biggest in the European Union, rose 11 percent on
higher yields, while the country’s wheat crop dropped, the
government statistics office reported.  The sugar-beet crop climbed to 5.86 million metric tons
from 5.28 million tons a year earlier, with yields rising to
79.9 tons per hectare (2.47 acres) from 74.8 tons, the Centraal
Bureau voor de Statistiek  reported  on its website.  Dutch farmers harvested 1.18 million tons of wheat last
year, compared with 1.37 million tons in 2010, according to the
statistics office. Silage-corn production climbed to 10.6
million tons from 10.3 million tons.  Potato production advanced 7.2 percent to 7.33 million tons
from 6.84 million tons, the data showed. The Netherlands is the
EU’s third-largest potato grower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
