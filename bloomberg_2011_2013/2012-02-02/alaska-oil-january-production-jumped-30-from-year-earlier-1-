Alaskan crude oil production jumped
30 percent in January from a year earlier, when the Trans Alaska
crude pipeline was forced shut following a leak, according to
the  Alaska Tax Division .  Production in January averaged 624,058 barrels a day, an
increase from 481,116 a year earlier and from 622,355 in the
previous month, according to a posting on the state’s website.
Output peaked for the month at 635,343 barrels on Jan. 15 and
touched a low of 615,307 barrels Jan. 2.  The 800-mile Trans-Alaska pipeline, carrying crude from
 Prudhoe Bay  on the North Slope to Valdez, the northernmost ice-
free port in the U.S., was shut for nine days in January 2011
after a leak was discovered at a pump station. That led to a 26
percent drop in Alaskan oil production from the previous month.  Alaska production  has declined annually since 2002, U.S.
Energy Department figures show, as falling output from existing
wells hasn’t been matched by new additions. The bulk of the
state’s oil is produced in the Prudhoe Bay area.  Oil inventories in the state averaged 3.5 million barrels
for the month, ranging from 4.79 million on Jan. 31 to 1.97
million on Jan. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
