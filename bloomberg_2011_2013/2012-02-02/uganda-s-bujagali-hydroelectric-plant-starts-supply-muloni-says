Uganda ’s 250-megawatt Bujagali
hydropower project started supplying electricity to the national
grid and may reach 50 megawatts later today, Energy Minister
Irene Muloni said.  Supply to the grid in the East African nation will rise as
the commissioning of all the plant’s capacity is expected in
July, Muloni said by phone from the capital, Kampala.  “They started testing the plant last week and supply
reached 37.5 megawatts this morning and may reach 50 megawatts
by the end of the day,” she said.  Uganda,  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy, has regular
nationwide outages amid a power deficit, with production at 375
megawatts and consumption at 450 megawatts by the end of last
year, President  Yoweri Museveni  said on Dec. 31.  The country will end electricity subsidies, which have cost
the nation 1.53 trillion shillings ($658 million) since 2005,
when Bujagali reaches full capacity, Muloni said Jan. 12.  Uganda will use the savings to finance public
infrastructure projects, including the construction of the 600
megawatt Karuma Hydropower Project, whose construction starts in
May, she said at the time.  The plant is jointly owned by Sithe Global Power LLC and
Industrial Promotion Services Kenya Ltd., an affiliate of the
Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development SA through Bujagali
Energy Ltd.  Construction of the five-turbine plant started in mid-2007
and was expected to cost $873 million, Bujagali Energy said in
January 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
