Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told House Budget Committee Chairman  Paul Ryan  that he
expects inflation to remain low and the dollar stable.  “Inflation currently looks to be very well controlled,”
Bernanke told Ryan, a Republican of  Wisconsin , during testimony
to the budget committee today.  “The dollar has been pretty stable, you know, since the
crisis,” Bernanke said. “We are not having any signs of higher
inflation or a declining dollar.”  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said Jan. 25 that
economic conditions are likely to warrant keeping the benchmark
lending rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent “at least
through late 2014.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
