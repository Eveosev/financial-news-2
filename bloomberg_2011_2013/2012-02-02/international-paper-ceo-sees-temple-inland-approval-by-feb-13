International Paper Co. (IP)  expects
antitrust approval for its acquisition of  Temple-Inland Inc. (TIN) 
before the merger agreement expires on Feb. 13, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer John Faraci said.  “We extended the timing agreement to the 13th of February
and we don’t anticipate it will need to be extended beyond that
and the merger agreement calls for closing within two days of
getting regulatory agreement,” Faraci said today in a telephone
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
