The share of North Sea Buzzard crude
in the Forties blend fell to 35 percent in the week to Jan. 29
from 39 percent a week earlier,  BP Plc (BP/)  said on its website.  The drop in Buzzard share means the sulfur content of
Forties blend declined to 0.65 percent from about 0.70 percent,
according to the website.  Oil produced from Buzzard, the biggest in the Forties
system, contains more sulfur than other streams, making it less
valuable.  Four Forties cargoes of 600,000 barrels each for February
loading were deferred by one to three days in the past week,
four people with knowledge of the export program said. Exports
of Forties were scheduled at 23 cargoes for February, one less
than last month, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Forties (EUCSFORT)  is one of four North Sea oil grades that make up
the Dated Brent benchmark, which is used to price crude from the
 Middle East ,  Africa  and  Russia . The other blends are Brent,
Ekofisk and Oseberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
