McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s largest
restaurant chain, claimed the lowest yield on a 30-year bond as
it tapped the  debt market  for $750 million in a two-part
offering as falling interest rates accelerate U.S. debt sales.  McDonald’s paid a 3.7 percent coupon on its $500 million of
30-year bonds sold today, a record low for the maturity,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities were
sold at 98.57 cents on the dollar at a yield of 3.78 percent, or
80 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries.  The company also issued $250 million of 2.625 percent 10-
year notes in an add-on at a spread of 52 basis points.  Oak
Brook , Illinois-based McDonald’s sold $500 million of the debt
on Sept. 27, Bloomberg data show. The notes traded at 102.6
cents on the dollar to yield 2.33 percent, a 51 basis-point
spread, at 4:40 p.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds in the U.S. have
fallen to 3.56 percent from 3.97 percent at the time of the
September sale and are close to the record 3.503 percent reached
Aug. 9, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  McDonald’s sold the debt after its Jan. 24 forecast of a
drop in profit this year because of currency fluctuations. It
followed investment-grade bond sales of $15.2 billion yesterday
that included issues from  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) ,
at record-low coupons of 0.55 percent for three-year notes and
1.25 percent for five-year securities, and  Procter & Gamble Co. ,
which paid a record-low 2.3 percent on a 10-year maturity.  The sale was managed by Bank of America Corp., Citigroup
Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc,
Bloomberg data show. McDonald’s has $966 million of bonds
 maturing  this year.  The restaurant chain is  rated  A2 by Moody’s Investors
Service and an equivalent A by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
