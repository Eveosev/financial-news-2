News Corp. (NWSA)  named Lex Fenwick chief
executive officer of Dow Jones & Co., the publisher of the Wall
Street Journal newspaper.  Fenwick, who replaces Les Hinton, joins Dow Jones from
Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, where he was most recently
CEO of Bloomberg Ventures, according to a statement today from
New York-based News Corp.  Fenwick will report to News Corp. Chief Operating Officer
 Chase Carey . Hinton left the company in July as News Corp. tried
to contain the fallout from the hacking scandal at its U.K. unit
that had previously been under his control.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
News Corp. units in providing financial news and information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
