Metro International SA (MTROSDBB) , the publisher
of newspapers in 22 countries, rose the most in 16 months in
Stockholm after its fourth-quarter net income doubled and the
company said it is on target to reach its margin goal.  The share rose as much as 17 percent, the biggest gain
since Oct. 7, 2010. It traded 6.8 percent, or 0.04 krona, higher
at 0.63 krona as of 9:56 a.m. Metro’s share lost half of its
value last year.  Net income from continuing operations increased to 11.4
million euros ($15 million) from 5.67 million euros as the
company added three Latin American countries and the global
number of daily readers increased by 5 percent year-on-year to
17.6 million, according to a statement today. Luxembourg-based
Metro said it is “well on track” to reach the target of a
“double-digit” margin in 2012 that the company announced in May
2008.  “We need to further improve our results to achieve the
double digit group margin target,” Chief Executive officer Per Mikael Jensen said. “Taking into account the cumulative effect
of the improvements we have made over the last few years, I am
reasonably confident that we will be able to deliver.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
