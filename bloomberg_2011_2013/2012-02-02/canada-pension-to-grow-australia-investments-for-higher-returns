The Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board, which manages about C$155 billion ($155 billion), plans
to increase its longer-dated investments in  Australia  to boost
returns, Chief Executive Officer David Denison said.  “We would like to grow CPPIB’s presence here,” Denison
told the Canadian Australian Chamber of Commerce in Sydney today,
according to an e-mailed copy of his speech. “Long duration
infrastructure assets are highly attractive investments for us
because we manage a portfolio that spans multiple generations.”  The pension fund is no stranger to Australia, with more
than half of its C$10 billion allocated to Asia-Pacific region
invested in the country, he said. It has partnered with the
Australian  Future Fund  and with real estate companies including
Westfield Group, Goodman Group and Dexus Property Group, and has
been a shareholder of some of the nation’s biggest companies
including BHP Billiton Ltd.,  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  and
Newcrest Mining Ltd.  The fund, forecast to double to more than C$300 billion
within the next decade and to more than CS$500 billion by 2031,
is looking oversees as it seeks to ensure future cash flows,
Denison said. Australia’s commodities and connections to fast-
growing Asian markets, tax policies and promotion of private
ownership of infrastructure make it an attractive destination,
he added.  The fund remains concerned about the openness of Australia
and other countries to foreign ownership of their assets,
Denison said, citing the government’s rejection of a proposed
merger between the Australian stock exchange and its Singaporean
counterpart.  He also expressed concern that more investors, particularly
pension plans and life insurance companies, are shortening their
investment horizons, doing away with their ability to provide
more sustainable funding for longer-term projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
