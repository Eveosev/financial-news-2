Anglo American Plc (AAL)  Chief Executive
Officer  Cynthia Carroll  is “recovering well” from an operation
following a hip injury she suffered during a horse-riding
accident on the weekend.  She has been advised by her doctor not to travel
internationally for about two months,  Pranill Ramchander , a
spokesman for the London-based company, said by phone today.
“Plans are in place to cover her overseas engagements,” he
said, adding she is in full contact with her executives and is
expected back in the office by the end of next week.  Carroll, among the 40  most powerful women  in the world
according to Forbes magazine, manages the fourth-largest
diversified mining company with iron-ore and diamond mines from
Brazil to  Australia . Carroll, also a BP Plc board member,
oversees Anglo’s $33 billion of annual sales and a project
pipeline of as much as $85 billion.  She’s leading Anglo’s $5.1 billion takeover of De Beers,
the world’s largest diamond producer, and a legal dispute with
state-owned Codelco in Chile, the biggest copper producer, where
Anglo has six operations.  Anglo climbed to its  highest closing level in eight months 
in Johannesburg trading as Xstrata Plc and Glencore
International Plc’s possible combination sparked speculation the
new entity could make a bid for Anglo. The stock closed 3.4
percent higher at 340.63 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
