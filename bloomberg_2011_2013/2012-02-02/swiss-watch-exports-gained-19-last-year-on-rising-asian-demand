Swiss watch exports  climbed 19
percent in 2011 to a record as Asian consumers fueled a boom in
the market for luxury timepieces.  Shipments rose to 19.3 billion Swiss francs ($21.1 billion)
from 16.2 billion francs a year earlier, the Federation of the
Swiss Watch Industry said today on its website. Exports in
December gained 21 percent, accelerating from the 16 percent
pace set during the previous month.  Consumers in  Asia  bought more than half of the Swiss
timepieces sold abroad last year, while  China  became the third-
biggest destination for watch exports. Shipments to  Hong Kong ,
the biggest market, jumped 28 percent. The rising number of
millionaires in China is boosting demand for  luxury goods  in the
country. Wealthy Chinese consumers own about four high-end
watches on average, according to the Hurun Wealth Report.  Shipments to the U.S. and China, the second and third
biggest markets for Swiss watches, increased 18 percent and 49
percent, respectively.  Swiss-watch exports will probably climb to another record
in 2012, though growth may slow to a “single-digit” pace,
Jean-Daniel Pasche, the head of the trade group, said in a Jan.
18 interview. While the market in Asia will continue to expand,
growth in  Europe  will be “very low,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
