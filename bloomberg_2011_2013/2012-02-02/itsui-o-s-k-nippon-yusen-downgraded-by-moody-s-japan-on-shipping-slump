Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104)  and  Nippon
Yusen KK (9101) ,  Japan ’s two largest shipping lines, were downgraded by
Moody’s Japan KK on concerns that slumping freight rates will
hamper the companies’ ability to pare debt levels.  Mitsui O.S.K. was cut to Baa1 and  Nippon Yusen  was reduced
to Baa2, Moody’s said in statements today. The Tokyo-based
shipping lines, which were both lowered by one grade, still
retain investment grade rankings. The outlook for both was
‘negative’.  The Japanese carriers both widened their full-year losses
forecasts earlier this week as expansion in the global fleet
outpaces demand for shipments, causing rates to fall. The  Baltic
Dry Index (BDIY) , the benchmark for commodity-carrying rates, yesterday
tumbled to the lowest in more than 25 years.  “The weak operating environment and over-supply in ocean-
going freight capacity” will hit the shipping lines’ cashflow,
Moody’s said. “That poor cashflow performance will delay a
reduction in leverage or, if the industry environment does not
improve, could lead to higher leverage.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
