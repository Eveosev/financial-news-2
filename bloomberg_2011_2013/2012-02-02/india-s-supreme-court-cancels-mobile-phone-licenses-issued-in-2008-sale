India ’s  Supreme Court  canceled 122
mobile-phone permits awarded by former telecommunications
minister  Andimuthu Raja  in a 2008 sale termed by the nation’s
auditor as “arbitrary.”  The court ordered some of the 10 operators to pay as much
as 50 million rupees ($1 million) as penalty, according to the
ruling by judges G.S. Singhvi and A.K. Ganguly. The Supreme
Court said the companies may continue with their operations for
four months.  The court’s verdict was in response to petitions from non-
government organizations and individuals, who have questioned
the validity of the licenses after the Comptroller and Auditor
General of India said in a report in 2010 that the sale of the
airwaves lacked transparency and ineligible bidders bought them
at “unbelievably low” prices. The corruption allegations have
weakened Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s government, stalling
its legislative agenda for most of the last 14 months.  Raja, who has denied all wrongdoing, is in jail in  New
Delhi  facing trial, while former officials in his ministry and a
lawmaker got bail.  Unitech Ltd. plunged as much as 14.3 percent in Mumbai
trading, while  Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM)  declined as much as
9.3 percent.  -- With assistance from Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi.
