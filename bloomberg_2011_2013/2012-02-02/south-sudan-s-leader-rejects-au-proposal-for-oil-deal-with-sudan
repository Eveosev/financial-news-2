South Sudanese President  Salva Kiir 
said he rejected an African Union proposal to end an oil dispute
with Sudan because it required the south to pay the north
billions of dollars and use its pipelines to export crude.  Kiir, who held African Union-mediated talks with Sudanese
President Umar al-Bashir on Jan. 27 in the Ethiopian capital,
Addis Ababa, said the proposal required South Sudan to ship
crude from certain  oil fields  through Sudan’s pipelines to the
 Red Sea .  “It is difficult for me to accept a deal that leaves our
people vulnerable, dependent and paying billions they do not
owe,” Kiir told reporters today in Juba, the capital. “This is
an attempt to ensure that we do not build our own pipelines.”  South Sudan  took control of about three-quarters of Sudan’s
output of 490,000 barrels of oil a day when it gained
independence in July. The crude is pumped mainly by  China
National Petroleum Corp. (CNPZ) , Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd. and
India’s ONGC Videsh Ltd.  South Sudan completed a shutdown of oil production on Jan.
26 after accusing government in Khartoum of diverting oil to its
refinery, forcing companies to load crude onto ships it
controlled, and blockading other shipments. Sudan said it
confiscated oil to cover unpaid bills.  South Sudan signed a memorandum of understanding with Kenya
on Jan. 24 to build a pipeline to the Kenyan port of Lamu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
