U.S. stocks pared gains as a decline
in health-care and industrial shares wiped out much of an
earlier rally that had sent benchmark indexes toward six-month
highs.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,324.66 at 11:44 a.m. New York time, trimming an advance of
as much as 0.4 percent.  U.S. equities rose earlier after Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said the economy has shown signs of improvement
and data showed claims for American jobless benefits fell last
week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
