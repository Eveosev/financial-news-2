Chinese imports of liquefied natural
gas will rise 42 percent this year, lifting rates for ships
hauling the fuel by adding demand, according to Arctic
Securities ASA.  The world’s largest energy consumer will import 17 million
metric tons of LNG in 2012, up from 12 million tons last year,
Oslo-based Arctic analyst Erik Nikolai Stavseth said in an e-
mailed note today. The increase will have a “positive effect”
on demand for ships, he said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
