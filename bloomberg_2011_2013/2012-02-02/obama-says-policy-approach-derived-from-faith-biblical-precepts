President  Barack Obama  said his
Christian faith and Biblical teachings guide his political
values and economic policies.  The president, speaking at the annual National Prayer
Breakfast in Washington, said his call to increase taxes on the
wealthy “coincides with Jesus’ teaching that ‘for unto whom
much is given, much shall be required.’”  From criticism of financial institutions and health
insurance companies to defending foreign aid, Obama said his
approach is guided by a belief that “comes from my faith in the
idea that I am my brother’s keeper and I am my sister’s
keeper.”  The National Prayer Breakfast brings together presidents,
members of Congress, diplomats and hundreds of religious,
business and military figures each year on the first Thursday of
February and has been attended by every president since Dwight Eisenhower in 1953, according the Fellowship Foundation, a
Christian group that organizes the event.  To contact the reporter on this story:
