Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  said earnings in the first
half through December probably rose as much as 90 percent from a
year earlier as the biggest maker of motor fuel from coal
benefited from higher  oil prices  and a weaker rand.  “The expected increase in earnings was mainly due to solid
operational performance in our businesses, coupled with a strong
improvement in the average crude oil and product prices and a
weaker rand-dollar  exchange rate ,” the Johannesburg-based
company said in a statement today.  Sasol, with operations in countries including Mozambique,
Qatar,  Iran  and the U.S., earned about two-thirds of its
operating profit from its South African energy business in the
2011 financial year. Crude oil was an average 14 percent higher
at $91.81 a barrel in the six months through December, compared
with $80.60 a year earlier.  The rand depreciated 16 percent against the dollar in the
same time, making it the world’s third-worst performer after
 Hungary ’s forint and Poland’s zloty, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It traded at an average of 7.6227 per dollar in
the period, 6.7 percent weaker than the average of 7.1137 rand a
year earlier.  The company also benefited from gains on foreign-exchange
contracts, it said. Its  shares  rose to the strongest level in
more than a week, trading 1.1 percent up at 407.02 rand at 2:04
p.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
