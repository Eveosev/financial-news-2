Temperatures in  Europe , where a cold
snap has killed more than 100 people, may start to rise tomorrow
night as clouds and snow move northeast in Ukraine, said
forecaster AccuWeather.com.  Ukraine,  Poland  and surrounding countries face freezing
weather tonight, and lows tomorrow morning will be near this
morning’s “dangerously” cold levels, the forecaster said.
Temperatures in Kiev reached minus 28 degrees Celsius (minus 18
degrees Fahrenheit) this morning, the lowest this century,
AccuWeather.com said.  “Unseasonably chilly air will continue to flow throughout
Europe next week, but will fail to produce a repeat of this
week’s extreme temperatures,” AccuWeather said. Belarus and
Poland will get relief from “brutal cold” over the weekend,
according to the forecaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
