Scottish support for independence
falls when voters are offered a choice between staying in the
U.K. and becoming an independent country, according to a  poll 
published today.  Support for staying in the U.K. is 67 percent compared with
33 percent who back Scotland becoming independent when voters
are asked to choose between the two, a poll commissioned by
billionaire Michael Ashcroft, a former deputy chairman of the
 Conservative Party , showed. Backing for independence increased
when the U.K. wasn’t mentioned in the question, the poll found.  Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond plans to hold a
referendum on independence in the fall of 2014. The ruling
 Scottish National Party  is consulting on its proposed question
‘Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country?’  That phrasing garnered 41 percent support with 59 percent
opposed. When voters were asked whether they agreed or disagreed
that  Scotland  should be an independent country, the percentage
of those in favor of independence fell to 39, with 61 percent
against.  The survey polled 3,090 Scots between Jan. 26 to Jan. 31.
Each question was posed to about 1,000 people.  “What is clear is that the SNP have chosen the version of
the question most likely to deliver the answer that would most
please them,” Ashcroft said on his  website . “The question is
too important to be asked in such a partisan way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
