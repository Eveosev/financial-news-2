A car owner who sued  Honda Motor Co. (7267) 
over allegations the automaker overstated gas mileage for her
2006 Civic Hybrid said she won $9,867 in small claims court in
 Los Angeles .  “I am absolutely thrilled at the reports that I won, even
though I won’t see the actual judgment until it comes in the
mail,” Heather Peters said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.
“It’s a victory for Civic Hybrid owners everywhere!” The award
couldn’t be immediately confirmed in court records.  Peters, who is a lawyer, opted out of a proposed class
action  settlement  over claims the Civic Hybrid doesn’t get 50
miles per gallon as the carmaker says and filed her own case in
small claims court, where plaintiffs and defendants represent
themselves.  The class-action settlement offered as little as $100 in
cash and a $500 coupon toward a new car, Peters said before a
Jan. 25 hearing.  Chris Martin , a spokesman for American Honda Motor Co. in
Torrance, didn’t immediately return a call to his office
yesterday seeking comment on the ruling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
