Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , the advisory
firm founded by former U.S. Deputy Treasury secretary  Roger Altman , said fourth-quarter profit increased 29 percent as
investment-banking net revenue jumped.  Earnings excluding certain items rose to $14.1 million, or
32 cents a share, from $10.9 million, or 27 cents, in the year
earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for adjusted earnings of 28 cents. Investment-banking revenue
increased 19 percent to $90.3 million.  Altman, 65, said last month that the biggest banks have
better financial strength than many believe and mergers and
acquisitions may be more robust this year. Evercore ranked 14th
on the financial advisory league tables last year, overseeing
$101.8 billion in announced transactions, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘In  investment banking , we consistently gained market share
while maintaining high levels of productivity,” Chief Executive
Officer Ralph Schlosstein, 60, said in the statement.  Evercore fell 24 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $29 in  New York .
The shares have gained 8.9 percent this year.  Chief Financial Officer Robert Walsh said the firm expects
to see “upward pressure” on non-compensation costs related to
the relocation of U.K. facilities. Total expenses rose 24
percent to $113.8 million in the fourth quarter and increased 44
percent to $488.5 million in 2011.  Biggest Deals  The firm’s biggest deals last year included advising Kinder
Morgan Inc. on its $37.6 billion announced takeover of El Paso
Corp. and Exelon Corp. on its $10.2 billion agreement to
purchase Constellation Energy Group Inc.  It was advising on AT&T Inc.’s agreement to purchase T-
Mobile USA Inc. for $39 billion, a deal that collapsed in
December. AT&T abandoned the proposed takeover after the  Justice
Department  sued to block the transaction and the Federal
Communications Commission moved to oppose it.  “There has been a change in both the U.S. and in  Europe  on
competition policy,” Altman said on a conference call after
results were announced, referring to deals that have been
blocked by regulators. “There’s been a notable tightening of
criteria.”  Income, Revenue Rise  Evercore reported a record full-year pro-forma net income
for 2011 of $63.1 million, an increase of 66 percent from the
year earlier, according to the statement. Adjusted pro-forma net
revenue rose 9.8 percent to $111.6 million in the fourth quarter
and jumped 40 percent to $520.4 million for the year.  Evercore earned advisory fees from 127 clients in the
fourth quarter, compared with 91 in the year earlier, according
to the statement. Advisory fees exceeded $1 million from 26
clients, up from 20 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Full-year
pro-forma investment banking net revenue rose to $421.4 million
from $296.1 million.  The firm’s restructuring advisory business has been “quite
active,” Altman said on the call.  Investment management pro-forma net revenue fell 16 percent
to $21.3 million in the three months ended Dec. 31. Full-year
net revenue in the segment was $98.9 million, a record for the
unit, compared with a $76.9 million in 2010.  The company said in October it would wind down Evercore
Asset Management, a 51 percent-owned institutional  money manager 
specializing in small- and mid-cap equities.  Evercore’s compensation expense climbed to $74.9 million,
or 56 percent of net revenue, from $67 million, or 61 percent,
in the fourth quarter of 2010, according to the statement. The
firm expects to have a “strong recruiting year” in 2012,
Schlosstein said on the conference call.  The firm repurchased about 1.6 million shares in 2011,
including 366,000 in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
