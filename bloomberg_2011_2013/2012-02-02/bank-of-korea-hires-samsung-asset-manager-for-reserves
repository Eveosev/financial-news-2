The  Bank of Korea  hired a Samsung
asset manager to help run its $311 billion foreign-exchange
reserves.  Eugene Kim, who will resign from the position of chief
investment officer at Samsung Asset Management Co. at the end of
this month, will replace Chae Sun Byoung as the director of the
Reserve Investment Division under the bank’s Reserve Management
Group, the central bank said in a statement today.  “Kim, with ample expertise and experience in asset
management, is expected to make a significant contribution to
our capacity to manage foreign-exchange reserves,” the bank
said in a statement.  South Korea ’s foreign-exchange  reserves  climbed by $4.94
billion to $311.3 billion at the end of January from a month
earlier, the Bank of  Korea  said today in a separate report,
citing asset management gains and the euro and pound’s rise
against the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
