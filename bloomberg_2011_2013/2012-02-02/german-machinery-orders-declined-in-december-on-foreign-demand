German  plant and machinery orders 
dropped in December on weaker foreign demand, reflecting a
slowdown of the global economy, the VDMA machine makersâ€™
association said.  Orders, adjusted for inflation, fell 10 percent from a year
earlier after declining 12 percent in November, which was the
first annual drop in almost two years, the Frankfurt-based  VDMA 
said in an e-mailed statement today. Domestic orders were
unchanged, while export orders slumped 14 percent.  In the fourth quarter, orders dropped 7 percent from a year
earlier. Plant and machinery orders increased 10 percent in
2011, VDMA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
