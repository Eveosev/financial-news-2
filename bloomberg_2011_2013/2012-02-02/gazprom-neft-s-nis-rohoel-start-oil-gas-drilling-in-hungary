Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) , a
Serbian  oil company  controlled by  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) , and Rohoel
Aufsuchungs AG of Austria began drilling a field in southern
Hungary in search of oil and gas.  The exploration work began Jan. 31, six weeks after NIS and
Rohoel agreed to split costs and profits from the 2,255 square
kilometer (870 square mile) field in the Kiskunhalas region, and
they will drill at two locations in 2012, NIS said by e-mail.  The partners will invest 10 million euros ($13 million) on
exploration this year and may begin production in 2013, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
