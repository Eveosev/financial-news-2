The following companies are having
unusual price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 1:24 p.m. local time.  The IPC  index  was little changed at 37,705.73.  Mexican equities were little changed in line with U.S.
stocks as investors await tomorrow’s U.S. jobs data to gauge the
economic outlook. Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports
to the U.S.  Grupo Famsa SAB (GMFAMSAA)  (GFAMSAA MM), a Mexican retailer, gained
5.4 percent to 12.69 pesos.  Gruma SAB (GRUMAB)  , Mexico’s
largest maker of corn flour for tortillas, gained 1.7 percent to
29.65 pesos.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO)  , the largest cement maker in the
Americas, rose 7.3 percent to 9.76 pesos. The company said its
fourth-quarter loss narrowed to 14 cents per American depositary
receipt today in a statement, beating the average estimate of 17
cents in a survey of eight analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The
company’s shares rose for a fourth consecutive day.  Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO)  , the world’s largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, fell 3.6 percent to 51.01 pesos.
Televisa fell for the 10th time in 11 days after Mexico’s
antitrust agency rejected its $1.6 billion plan to enter the
nation’s mobile-phone market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
