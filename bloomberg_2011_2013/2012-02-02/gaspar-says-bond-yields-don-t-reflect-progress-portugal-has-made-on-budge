Portuguese government bond yields
aren’t reflecting the progress that the country has made
controlling its budget deficit, with its adjustment program
“well on track,” Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said.  “Since  Portugal  is under a program it does not finance
itself, so yield differentials do not reflect the cost of
financing,” Gaspar said last night at the  London School  of
Economics. “Yields in the secondary market do not reflect
fundamentals. Volumes are very low. On some days turnover is
actually zero.”  Portugal’s 10-year government bond yield climbed to a euro-
era record on Jan. 30. Yields have since fallen for two
consecutive days as concern eased that investors in the nation’s
securities may be forced to take losses in the event of a Greek
debt-swap deal. Portuguese  10-year bonds  climbed yesterday,
pushing the yield down 118 basis points to 15.221 percent.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is cutting spending and
raising taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($103
billion) aid plan from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund . As the country’s borrowing costs surged, Portugal
followed Greece and Ireland in April in seeking a bailout and
now aims to return to bond markets in 2013.  Airline Sale  Portugal is also selling assets and plans to begin the sale
of airline TAP SGPS SA soon, Gaspar said yesterday.  “We intend to start the privatization process of TAP very
soon,” Gaspar said. He said he hopes to see the sale completed
“as fast as feasible.”  Portugal narrowed its budget deficit to about 4 percent of
gross domestic product in 2011 following the transfer of banks’
pension funds to the state. The government expects the  budget
deficit  will reach 4.5 percent of GDP in 2012 and the EU ceiling
of 3 percent in 2013, after hitting 9.8 percent in 2010.  Portuguese government debt is projected to “stabilize” at
112 percent of GDP in 2013, after reaching 111 percent in 2012
and 101.6 percent last year, the European Commission forecast in
November. Debt was 93.3 percent of GDP in 2010.  The austerity measures are hurting the economy, which will
shrink 3 percent in 2012, the European Commission forecast on
Nov. 10. The country’s  economic growth  has averaged less than 1
percent a year for the past decade, placing it among  Europe ’s
weakest performers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
