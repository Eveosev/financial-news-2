Germany’s two-year notes fell for a
second day after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said the economy has shown signs of improvement, damping demand
for the safest securities.  French bonds gained after borrowing costs declined at a
sale of benchmark 10-year debt, shrinking the extra yield that
investors demand for holding the nation’s 10-year debt instead
of bunds to the narrowest since December. Spanish 10-year bonds
fell for the first time in three days as the nation sold 4.56
billion euros ($6 billion) of notes.  “Bernanke came across as more balanced than before,” said
 Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “There’s still a
favorable environment for risky products, which means people are
going to switch out of bunds.”  Germany ’s two-year  yield  rose three basis point, or 0.03
percentage point, to 0.21 percent at 5 p.m. in London after
climbing two basis points yesterday. The 0.25 percent note
maturing in December 2013 fell 0.05, or 50 euro cents per 1,000-
euro face amount, to 101.08.  “Over the past few months, indicators of spending,
production, and job-market activity have shown some signs of
improvement,” Bernanke said, according to prepared testimony to
the House Budget Committee in  Washington . “The outlook remains
uncertain, however, and close monitoring of economic
developments will remain necessary.”  French Bonds  The  French (GFRN10)  10-year yield fell 13 basis points to 2.9
percent, narrowing the  spread  over benchmark German yields by 13
basis points to 1.05 percentage points. The gap earlier
contracted to 1.04 percentage points, the least since Dec. 28.  France  sold 5.698 billion euros of 10-year bonds at an
average yield of 3.13 percent, compared with 3.29 percent at the
previous auction of the maturity on Jan. 5.  It was “a solid auction that suggests diminishing worries
about France as a name as well as a good underpinning for core
bonds in general,”  Luca Jellinek , head of European interest-
rate strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
London, wrote in an e-mailed note.  Bunds rose earlier after a European report showed producer-
price  inflation  slowed in December, adding to signs the region’s
growth is cooling.  Producer prices  in the 17-nation euro region rose 4.3
percent from a year earlier after increasing a revised 5.4
percent in November, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said.  Spanish Sale  Spanish bonds dropped as the nation sold 4.56 billion euros
of notes due in 2015, 2016 and 2017, just surpassing the maximum
target of 4.5 billion euros set for the auctions. That compares
with a 6.61 billion euro sale on Jan. 19, which far exceeded the
4.5 billion euros target.  “ Spain  doesn’t seem to be that much of a hit,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in London.
“They have done most of their supply at the shorter-dated paper
because that’s where the ECB is supporting the market. It would
have been much better if they had been able to sell more of the
longer-dated bonds, that would give them more time before they
had to roll it over.”  Spain’s 10-year yields climbed eight basis points to 4.93
percent after dropping to 4.84 percent yesterday, the lowest
since November 2010.  German bunds are little changed this year, after returning
9.8 percent in 2011, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
Spanish securities have gained 3 percent in 2012, and Italian
bonds jumped 7.4 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
