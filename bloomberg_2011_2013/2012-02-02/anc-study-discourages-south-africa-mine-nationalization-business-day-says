A report by  South Africa ’s ruling
 African National Congress  found that nationalization of the
country’s mines would be unconstitutional and too expensive,
Johannesburg-based Business Day reported, without saying where
it got the information.  The ANC’s youth wing, led by  Julius Malema , has led calls
for the nationalization of mines and the seizure of land in
South Africa, where more than a quarter of the population is
unemployed. The ANC, led by  Jacob Zuma , have said that mine
nationalization isn’t government policy.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
