“A positive attitude toward equity
investing is now in order” because U.S. bank stocks are doing
relatively well and volatility is fading, according to Donald Coxe, a strategy adviser to Bank of Montreal.  The CHART OF THE DAY combines three indicators that Coxe
used to draw this conclusion in his latest monthly report. The
top panel tracks the ratios of two KBW Inc. bank indexes -- one
for the largest U.S. lenders and the other for regional banks --
to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The bottom panel depicts the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or the VIX.  Coxe recommended that U.S. pension funds lift holdings of
domestic stocks by 6 percentage points, to 20 percent of assets.
The Chicago-based strategist also called for a 2-point increase
in dividend-paying shares, to 12 percent.  KBW’s regional-bank gauge jumped 37 percent from Sept. 21,
when its ratio reached last year’s low, through yesterday. The
 S&P 500  rose 13 percent during the same period. Similarly, the
KBW Bank Index gained more than twice as much as the S&P 500
during the past two months.  “It is good for the stock market that they are thriving,”
Coxe wrote in his report, dated Jan. 27. He added that the VIX,
a gauge of investor fear, signals the market “isn’t skating on
a pond whose ice is about to crack.”  The VIX has closed below 20 for the past 10 trading days,
the longest streak since June. When stocks slumped last August,
the index rose as high as 48.  To contact the reporter on this story:
