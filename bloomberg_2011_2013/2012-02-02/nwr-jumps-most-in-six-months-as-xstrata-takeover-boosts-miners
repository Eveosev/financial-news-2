New World Resources Plc (NWR)  rose the most
in almost six months after Xstrata Plc confirmed that Glencore
International Plc approached it about a takeover offer, boosting
investor demand for mining companies across  Europe .  NWR, the biggest Czech coking-coal producer, increased 7.7
percent to 153.9 koruna at the close in Prague, its biggest one-
day rally since Aug. 15. The stock was the best performer today
in the  PX (PX)  equity gauge, which added 1.5 percent. Turnover was
978,740 NWR shares, or three times the three-month daily
average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
