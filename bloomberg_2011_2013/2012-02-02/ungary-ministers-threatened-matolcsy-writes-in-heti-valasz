Hungarian government members were
“personally threatened” after the cabinet levied a special tax
on banks, Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  wrote in  Heti Valasz 
today.  “We received personal threats at the time we introduced
the bank tax: revoke it or you’ll be finished off,” he said.  The government is under attack because it’s using its
“strong mandate” to overhaul regulations governing financial
businesses, Matolcsy wrote, adding that “the era of banks is
over, the era of work has arrived.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
