The Philippine peso rose to a three-
month high as speculation policy makers will cut borrowing costs
to support economic growth spurred demand for the nation’s
assets. Ten-year bonds gained.  Foreign funds bought $372 million more local stocks than
they sold this year through yesterday, according to exchange
data. The central bank, which lowered its  benchmark  rate last
month for the first time since 2009, isn’t ruling out another
reduction this quarter, Governor Amando Tetangco said yesterday
after a report this week showed economic growth slowed in 2011.  “For the  Philippines , the positive credit fundamentals are
helping, meaning yields are still low, supporting local
equities,” said Estelito Biacora, senior vice president and
head of private banking in  Manila  at Bank of the Philippine
Islands. Foreign investors “are still keeping their holdings in
Philippine bonds,” he said.  The peso appreciated 0.7 percent to 42.662 per dollar at
the close in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched
42.660 earlier, the strongest level since Nov. 1. The currency
has advanced 2.8 percent this year.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas lowered the rate it pays
lenders for overnight deposits by a quarter of a percentage
point to 4.25 percent on Jan. 19. The Philippine economy grew
3.7 percent in 2011, compared with a revised 7.6 percent
expansion a year earlier and a government target of at least 4.5
percent, a report showed on Jan. 30.  Bonds Advance  The yield on the 6.375 percent debt due January 2022 fell
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.05 percent, to
prices from Tradition Financial Services.  Philippine Treasurer  Roberto Tan  said yesterday the
nation’s bonds,  Asia ’s second-best performers in the past year,
will probably advance in 2012 as the country wins an investment-
grade rating and the government borrows less.  The Bureau of the Treasury sold 9 billion pesos ($211
million) of 20-year notes on Jan. 31 at an average yield of
5.906 percent, compared with 8.024 percent when such securities
were last sold a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
