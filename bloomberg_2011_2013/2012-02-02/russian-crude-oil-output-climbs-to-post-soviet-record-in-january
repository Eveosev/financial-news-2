Russian  oil production  rose 0.4
percent in January from the previous month, setting a post-
Soviet record.  Output from the world’s largest oil producer climbed to
10.36 million barrels a day last month from 10.32 million
barrels a day in December, according to preliminary data from
the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit. That was a 1.4 percent
increase from 10.21 million barrels a day in January 2011.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin , who will seek re-election as
president in March, has called for  Russia  to pump more than 10
million barrels a day for at least the next decade, and lowered
the  tax rate  on crude exports to encourage output. Oil taxes are
the biggest contributor to the national budget.  Average production passed Putin’s target level in 2009 for
the first time since the  Soviet Union  collapsed in 1991,
reaching 10.35 million barrels a day in October last year.
Soviet-era output peaked at 11.48 million barrels a day in 1987,
according to  BP Plc (BP/)  data.  Exports rose to 5.29 million barrels a day in January, an
increase of 1.2 percent from the previous month and 2.3 percent
from January 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
