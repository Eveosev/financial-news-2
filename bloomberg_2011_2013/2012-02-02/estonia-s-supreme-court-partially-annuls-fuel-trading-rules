Estonia’s  Supreme Court  partially
annulled legislation introduced in 2011 to stamp out fraud in
the fuel industry in a move that may bring litigation from
retailers and wholesalers.  The transition period to adopt last April’s regulations was
insufficient, the court ruled, meaning they won’t apply to
companies registered before then until a new one can be
determined, according to a statement on its  website  yesterday
from the capital, Tallinn.  The court also canceled a clause exempting companies
created three years ago or more from depositing a minimum of
100,000 euros ($131,000) with the tax board in order to be
registered, calling the provision unconstitutional.  The Baltic nation drew up the rules to prevent companies
from importing fuel and declaring bankruptcy shortly afterwards
without paying value-added tax. VAT revenue from the fuel
industry was 50 million euros more than the year-earlier period
in the second half of 2011, the Postimees newspaper reported
today, citing Finance Ministry officials.  While the ministry won’t have to alter the regulation
requiring security from fuel traders as it still applies to
newly created companies, it will need to adjust its policy as
regards the clauses annulled by the court, Marek Uuskula, head
of the excise-policy department, said today in an e-mailed
response to Bloomberg questions.  Companies that provided cash as security or were forced out
of business because of the requirement may seek repayment and
damages, Helmut Pikmets, a managing partner with the VARUL law
company in Tallinn, said today by e-mail.  Pikmets represented the plaintiff, Korvekula Tankla OU, in
the case against the state that prompted the court’s ruling. As
Estonia’s highest court, its decision is final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
