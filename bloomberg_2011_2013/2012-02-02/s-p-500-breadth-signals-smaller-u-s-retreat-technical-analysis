The breadth of the U.S. stock rally
has persuaded Bank of America Corp.’s Mary Ann Bartels to scale
back her forecast for losses in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The  cumulative advance-decline line  for stocks trading on
the New York Stock Exchange, which represents the number of
daily gains minus the number of declines, surpassed its November
high last month, a sign of the rally’s strength, said Bartels,
the New York-based head of technical and market analysis at the
firm. Investors should buy the largest stocks on a dip that may
occur in the next two months, she said.  The  S&P 500  has climbed 5.3 percent to 1,324.09 in 2012 as
investors gained confidence European leaders will be able to
stem the region’s debt crisis. The benchmark gauge for U.S.
stocks has rebounded more than 20 percent from its in October
low of 1,099.23. Bartels had said on Dec. 27 the  S&P 500 
probably would retreat near that low before gaining in the
second half of 2012. Now, she sees the measure dropping to
between 1,200 and 1,250.  “There’s enough cash on the sidelines for stocks to go
up” in 2012, she said in a phone interview on Jan. 31. “Most
investors have missed the rally, which is bullish for the
market.”  Shifts in money flows out of bond funds and into equity
funds may fuel further gains, according to Bartels. Customers of
U.S. mutual funds have pulled about $102 billion from stock
funds since December 2010 through November, while adding $114
billion into bond funds, according to the  Investment Company
Institute  in  Washington .  Asset Allocation  “What we’re looking for is an  asset allocation  out of
bonds and into stocks,” she said. “This rally has been fueled
by cash in our view, not by asset allocation change. If you got
an allocation out of bonds into stocks, that would power the
market up for sure.”  While the S&P 500 may experience a correction between
February and March, potentially falling as low as 1,200,
investors should buy the largest U.S. companies that offer
growth and yield during the dip, Bartels said.  She recommended stocks in the  Nasdaq-100 Index (NDAQ) , which rose
to 2,488.18 yesterday, the highest level since February 2001.
The gauge has jumped 9.2 percent in 2012, as computer and
software makers have exceeded fourth-quarter earnings estimates
by more than any other industry and Apple Inc. posted record
profit and sales on Jan. 24.  Investors seeking yield should purchase the worst-
performing stocks in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  that pay
above-average dividends, a strategy known as “The Dogs of the
Dow,” Bartels said. Verizon Communications Inc.,  Procter &
Gamble Co . and Chevron Corp. have declined at least 3.3 percent
this year for the  biggest declines  in the gauge. The Dow’s
current payout ratio is 2.5 percent, compared with the S&P 500’s
2 percent dividend rate and  Russell 2000  Index’s 1.4 percent
yield.  To contact the reporter on this story:
