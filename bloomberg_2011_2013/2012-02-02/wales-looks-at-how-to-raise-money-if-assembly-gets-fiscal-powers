Lawmakers in the  Welsh Assembly  began
looking at how the principality’s semi-autonomous government
might raise money if it’s granted borrowing powers.  The assembly’s Finance Committee “has decided to undertake
an inquiry examining local authorities’ experiences of
prudential borrowing and different models of capital funding
which may be suitable for the Welsh government,” Jocelyn
Davies, the lawmaker who heads the panel, said in a statement.
“We will be considering the existing models currently in use by
local authorities as well as more innovative mechanisms to gain
capital funding for infrastructure projects.”  Voters in  Wales  opted in March to broaden the powers of
the assembly in Cardiff, allowing local lawmakers to pass
legislation without gaining the consent of the national U.K.
Parliament in  London . The U.K. government  set up a commission  in
October that will examine the case for devolving fiscal powers.  The Scottish government, which has greater powers than its
Welsh counterpart, set out its plans last week for a referendum
on independence from the U.K. in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
