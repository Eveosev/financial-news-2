The Bovespa stock index fell for the
first time in three days as raw material producers including  OGX
Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA  followed commodities prices
lower, outweighing a rally by homebuilder  Gafisa SA (GFSA3) .  OGX, the  oil company  controlled by billionaire  Eike
Batista , and  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s state-controlled
oil company, declined as crude fell to a six-week low. Gafisa
was the best performer on the gauge after it said in a
regulatory filing it’s studying an acquisition offer.  The Bovespa dropped 0.5 percent to 64,224.18 at 3:39 p.m.
in Sao Paulo. Forty-eight stocks dropped on the index, while 22
gained. The real strengthened 0.6 percent to 1.7237 per  U.S.
dollar . The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials
declined 1.1 percent.  “Despite a good start to the year, stocks linked to
commodities are a more dangerous bet, as their performance will
always be subject to changes in the external outlook,” Renato Bandeira de Mello, head of equity trading at Futura Corretora,
said by phone from  Sao Paulo .  OGX declined 2.9 percent to 16.98 reais, contributing the
most to the Bovespa’s decline. Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro
is known, sank 1.4 percent to 24.58 reais.  Gafisa gained 4 percent to 5.25 reais. The stock is headed
for its steepest three-day gain since May 2009, rising 17
percent after Exame magazine’s website reported, without saying
where it got the information, GP Investments and  Sam Zell  were
in talks to form a partnership to buy the homebuilder.  Gafisa said in a regulatory filing today it’s in talks with
both investors. GP declined to comment, according to an e-mailed
statement sent by an external press officer in  Rio de Janeiro .
Equity International, the fund Zell co-founded in 1999, didn’t
return phone calls from Bloomberg News seeking comment.  Redecard Earnings  Redecard SA (RDCD3) ,  Brazil ’s second-biggest card-payment processor
by market value, climbed 2.5 percent to 32.19 reais after
reporting net income that rose 31 percent from a year earlier.
The company said adjusted net income, which excludes some items,
increased to 456.9 million reais ($265.4 million), from 348.7
million reais a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing.
That was more than the 402 million reais mean estimate of 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3) , the maker of more than 180 consumer
products, advanced 2.8 percent to 11.13 reais on signs policy
makers will keep cutting the benchmark lending rate. “We have
signaled that the monetary easing cycle has not finished,”
central bank President Alexandre Tombini told reporters today in
Mumbai. “We are in a different environment today than we were
at the start of 2011, so we have some room to reduce rates.”  Interest-Rate Outlook  In the interest-rate futures market, yields on most
contracts fell. The yield on the contract due in January 2014,
the most traded today, dropped five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 9.88 percent.  The Bovespa has advanced 13 percent this year, buoyed by
Brazil’s interest-rate cuts, signs of growth in the U.S. and
renewed optimism  Europe  may be closer to solving its debt
crisis. The gauge trades at 10 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, in line with the ratio for MSCI Inc.’s measure of 21
developing nations’ equities, weekly data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Foreign investors poured 7.17 billion reais into  Latin
America ’s largest equity market in January, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. They pulled 1.35 billion reais from the
Bovespa in 2011.  Traders  moved  9.77 billion reais in stocks in Sao Paulo
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a
daily average of 6.17 billion reais this year through Jan. 30,
according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
