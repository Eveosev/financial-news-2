Central European Distribution Corp.
will “certainly consider” Russian Standard Corp.’s proposal to
raise its stake in the company to 33 percent, Chief Executive
Officer William Carey.  Russian Standard, controlled by billionaire Roustam Tariko,
seeks to convert $103 million of bonds into shares in the vodka
producer that owns Zubrowka and Parliament brands, as well as
buy new stock, Tariko wrote in a letter to CEDC’s board of
directors yesterday.  “We will certainly consider this proposal as well as other
options the company is currently exploring, for the best benefit
of our shareholders,” Carey wrote in an e-mailed response to
questions from Bloomberg News today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
