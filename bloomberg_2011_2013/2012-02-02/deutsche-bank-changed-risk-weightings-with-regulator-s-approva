(Corrects wording of quotation in second paragraph.)  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  modified the risk-
weightings of assets related to credit risk with the approval of
Germany’s financial regulator, Chief Financial Officer  Stefan
Krause  said.  “The models were put in place, reviewed and approved by
our regulator one by one after a long test and an audit,” he
said on a conference call with analysts today. “About half is
real  risk reduction  and the other half is model and process-
related improvements.”  Deutsche Bank’s risk-weighted assets rose by a total 44
billion euros ($57.8 billion) in the fourth quarter as the
company applied Basel 2.5 rules. The company reduced credit-
related risk-weighted assets by 22.6 billion euros in the
period, according to slides posted on the bank’s website for
Krause’s presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
