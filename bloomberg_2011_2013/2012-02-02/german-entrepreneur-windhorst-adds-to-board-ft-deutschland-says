Lars Windhorst, a technology-
entrepreneur protege of former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, is
adding prominent executives from the country to the board of his
investment fund, the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Air Berlin Plc (AB1)  founder Joachim Hunold and consultant Roland Berger are among the half-dozen people joining the board of
 Sapinda Holding BV , which is led by Windhorst and South African
billionaire Robert Hersov and counts  Agco Corp. (AGCO)  Chief Executive
Officer Martin Richenhagen and Saudi Arabian billionaire Kamal Bahamdan as members, the German newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
