South Korea , the world’s second-
biggest buyer liquefied natural gas, said it paid 25 percent
more for imports of the fuel in 2011 amid a 12.5 percent
increase in volumes from a year earlier.  The country paid about $650 a metric ton, equivalent to
about $12.50 per million British thermal units, on a delivered
basis for term and spot cargoes, according to Bloomberg
calculations based data from the Korean International Trade
Association  website . The cost the year before was about $522.
Overseas purchases rose to 36.7 million tons last year from 32.6
million in 2010, the figures showed.  Spot and short-term purchases cost on an average $607 a ton
last year, up 22 percent from 2010, according to calculations
based on the data. That’s equivalent to $11.70 per million Btu,
about $2.70 higher than the 2011 average for U.K. front month
gas futures, typically used to price spot cargoes to  Asia ,
according to  calculations  based on Bloomberg data. U.S.
benchmark gas averaged $4.028 per million Btu last year.  The  Japan Crude Cocktail (CKTJJCC) , a basket of imported oil into
 Japan  used to price LNG cargoes sold to Asia under long-term
contracts, averaged $107.34 a barrel last year, up 36 percent
from the 2010 average, according to data on Bloomberg.  Short-term sales volumes rose by 20 percent to 6 million
tons. The biggest spot suppliers last year were  Trinidad &
Tobago  followed by Nigeria, which accounted for a combined 2.71
million, according to the data.  The North Asian nation bought 4.81 million tons of the
power-station fuel in December, up 47 percent from a year
earlier, the data showed.  South Korea, which imports almost all its natural gas, paid
about $749 a ton for December purchases, compared with $506 a
ton a year earlier, the data showed.  The nation buys most of the fuel under multiyear contracts
from countries including Qatar, Oman and  Indonesia . State-run
 Korea Gas Corp. (036460)  is the nation’s biggest importer of LNG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
