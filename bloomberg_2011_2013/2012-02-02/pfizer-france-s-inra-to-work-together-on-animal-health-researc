France ’s National Institute for
Agricultural Research said it signed an agreement with Pfizer
Inc. to boost research cooperation in veterinary medicine.  The agreement will make it easier to set up future
partnerships and research contracts, and includes plans to share
knowledge and expertise, the Paris-based researcher, known by
its acronym INRA, wrote today in an online  statement .  The research cooperation could lead to jointly filed and
owned patents, INRA said. The institute said it already works
with Pfizer on finding treatments for bacteria that cause
mammary infections in cows and new ways to treat parasitic
infections in cattle, sheep and goats.  “This agreement is expected to facilitate cooperation
between the institute and the leading company in veterinary
pharmaceuticals in the framework of future research contracts,”
INRA said.  Claire Lauvernier, a Pfizer spokeswoman, confirmed the
cooperation agreement today. She did not provide further
details.  INRA and Pfizer may work together on developing vaccines
and treatments for infectious diseases, knowledge about viruses,
bacteria and parasites that cause illnesses, as well as genetics
and animal immunity, the French researcher wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
