OHB AG (OHB)  won an order valued at 250
million euros ($329 million) for eight Galileo satellites,
trumping larger rival  European Aeronautic Defence and Space  Co.,
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported, without saying where it
got the information.  OHB has in the past hired a unit of EADS’s Astrium division
called SSTL for about 40 percent of contracts, the German
newspaper said.  EADS’s Arianespace rockets are to transport Galileo
satellites into space, FTD reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
