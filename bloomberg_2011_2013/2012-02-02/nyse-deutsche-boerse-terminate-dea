Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  and  NYSE Euronext (NYX) 
terminated their merger agreement, a day after European
antitrust regulators rejected the combination.  The European Commission blocked the transaction, which at
its peak would have created a company valued at more than $26
billion, because it would have concentrated too much derivatives
trading in the hands of a single entity.  Shares of  Deutsche Boerse , based in  Frankfurt , had
retreated 22 percent through Jan. 31 since the companies said in
February 2011 that they were in merger negotiations. NYSE
Euronext, based in New York, had slumped 21 percent.  NYSE Euronext announced the termination in a statement on
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
