An agreement to build a $8 billion
liquefied natural gas project in southeast Nigeria is expected
to be signed next quarter, said Austen Oniwon, group managing
director of state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.  Gas supply agreements are being resolved and a tender
process is going on, Oniwon said today in the capital, Abuja.
“Before the third quarter, we will take the final  investment
decision  on Brass LNG,” he said.  The plant will be built at Brass in Bayelsa state in the
West African country’s oil-rich Niger River delta. NNPC has a 30
percent stake in Brass LNG, while  Total SA (FP) ,  Eni SpA (ENI)  and
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  Co. each hold 17 percent. LNG Japan and Itochu
Corp. hold 4 percent and 3 percent respectively, and a joint
venture between Sahara Group and Sempra Energy has 2 percent.  Nigeria is Africa’s top oil producer and the fifth-biggest
source of US oil imports. The West African nation, holder of
Africa’s largest gas reserves of more than 187 trillion cubic
feet, flares most of the fuel it produces along with oil because
it lacks the infrastructure to process it.  OK LNG, in which Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and
BG Group Plc are working with NNPC, “hasn’t made much
progress,” Oniwon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
