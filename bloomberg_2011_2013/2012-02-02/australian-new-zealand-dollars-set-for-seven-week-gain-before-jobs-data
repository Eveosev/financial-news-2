The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars strengthened against the  U.S. dollar  after a report
showed employers in the world’s biggest economy added more jobs
than forecast in January, boosting appetite for risky assets.  The Aussie reached a five-month high, erasing earlier
losses. New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, also rose as
stocks and commodity prices increased.  “Strong growth and still-low  interest rates  in the U.S.
are good for Aussie,” said  Adam Carr , a senior economist in
Sydney at ICAP Australia Ltd., a unit of the world’s biggest
interdealer broker.  Australia’s dollar rose 0.6 percent to $1.0776 at 11:25
a.m. in New York and reached $1.07778, the strongest level since
Aug. 4. The Aussie strengthened 1 percent to 82.449 yen. New
Zealand’s currency advanced 0.5 percent to 83.70 U.S. cents. The
kiwi gained 0.8 percent to 64.035 yen.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 1.3 percent and the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials gained 0.5
percent.  U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by 243,000, after a revised
203,000 gain in December, the Labor Department reported today in
Washington. The median of 89 economists in a Bloomberg Survey
had forecast an addition of 140,000. The  unemployment rate  fell
to 8.3 percent.  At a meeting last month, the  Federal Reserve  pledged to
keep its interest rate near zero until late 2014. The
accommodative policy tends to drive investors away from the
dollar as they seek higher yields elsewhere.  Greek Rescue  The Aussie and kiwi dropped earlier as concern mounted
Greece is struggling to conclude a deal on a second
international bailout. The rescue plan, which European officials
and creditors say may be wrapped up in coming days, includes a
loss of more than 70 percent for debt investors in a voluntary
exchange and loans likely to exceed the 130 billion euros now on
the table.  The antipodean currencies completed a seventh-straight week
of gains. The Australian dollar gained 1 percent against the
greenback this week and New Zealand’s tender rose 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
