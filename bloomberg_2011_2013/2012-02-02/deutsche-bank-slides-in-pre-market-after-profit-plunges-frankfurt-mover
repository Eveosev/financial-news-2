Deutsche Bank AG  (DBK) dropped in pre-
market trading after  Germany ’s biggest lender said profit
slumped 76 percent in the fourth quarter as the sovereign debt
crisis sapped trading.  The shares fell 3.5 percent to 32.85 euros in pre-market
trading at Lang & Schwarz Wertpapierhandelsbank AG as of 8:28
a.m. in Frankfurt. Deutsche Bank, based in Frankfurt, said net
income fell to 147 million euros ($194 million) from 601 million
euros in the final quarter of 2011, missing the 556 million-euro
average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann , who is delivering
full-year results for the last time before stepping down at the
end of May, was forced to abandon his goal of posting record
profit last year as clients shied from trades amid  Europe ’s
sovereign debt crisis. Anshu Jain, who will take over as co-CEO
with Juergen Fitschen, said last week that 2012 has started “on
a mildly better note” than 2011 ended.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
