Vietnam ’s  dong  strengthened, snapping
a three-day decline, after the government said the trade deficit
narrowed in January. Bonds held stable.  The country’s  trade gap  narrowed to $100 million, compared
with a revised deficit of $269 million in December, according to
preliminary data released today by the General Statistics Office
in Hanoi.  The currency gained 0.2 percent, to 20,976 as of 4:45 p.m.
local time, according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  “The smaller trade deficit has boosted investors’ optimism
about the economy,” said Lai Tat Ha, head of  currency trading 
at Hanoi-based Vietnam Technological & Commercial Joint-Stock
Bank. “It also made traders more confident in the central
bank’s commitment to keeping the dong stable this year.”  Vietnam will adjust policy interest rates to “more
suitable” levels after the first quarter, central bank Governor
Nguyen Van Binh said in Jan. 11. Binh also forecasts the dong to
depreciate between 2 percent and 3 percent this year. That
compares with its 7.4 percent drop against the dollar last year.
Vietnam is targeting a balance-of-payments surplus of $3 billion
in 2012 and enough foreign-exchange reserves to cover 12 to 15
weeks of imports by 2015, he said last month.  The  yield  on benchmark five-year government bonds was
unchanged at 12.38 percent today, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
