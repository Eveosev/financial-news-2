European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co.  is seeking acquisitions in cyber security,  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  said, citing an interview with Stefan Zoller, head of
the company’s Cassidian defense unit.  Half of Cassidian’s sales will eventually come from outside
 Europe  so the unit will have to build up its business in
countries such as  India , Zoller told the German newspaper.
Orders in Europe are stagnating, he said.  Cassidian plans to save 370 million euros ($488 million) by
the end of 2013 with a restructuring program, Zoller said,
according to the newspaper. The unit expects additional
synergies from consolidation of its production operations,
Sueddeutsche said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
