Taiga Mistral , a Spanish private
equity fund focused on renewable energy, bought a wind project
in northern  Poland  that will cost about 90 million euros ($119
million) to develop. Terms were not disclosed.  Taiga Mistral bought the majority of the wind farm, and the
minority share will stay with an unnamed Polish investor,
according to a statement today from Squire Sanders, the  law firm 
that advised Taiga on the transaction.  Taiga Mistral, based in Madrid, has invested in wind farms
in Spain. This is its third in Poland. It will develop the
project with a capacity of more than 40 megawatts with the
Polish investor, according to the statement sent by e-mail.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
