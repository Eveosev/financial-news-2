The  European Union  should close a
loophole in bank capital rules that rates sovereign debt as
risk-free and allows lenders to escape holding reserves against
possible losses, the  Finance Watch  lobby group said.  “The existence of zero-risk weights is fundamentally
flawed and misleading, as there is no such thing as risk-free
assets,” said the research, published yesterday.  Losses on European sovereign debt have grown since the
onset of the Euro area financial crisis that may threaten the
survival of the euro.  Greece  is in discussions with private
creditors to sign a debt-swap deal three months after private
bondholders agreed to a 50 percent cut in the face value of more
than 200 billion euros ($262 billion) of debt.  “Risk weights penalize non-rated exposures,” including
some corporate and retail investments that have a 100 percent
risk-weight attributed to them, Finance Watch said.  The Brussels-based group, whose members include labor
unions and housing associations, also called for regulators to
impose a so-called  leverage ratio  on banks that would force them
to hold a minimum amount of capital against their assets without
taking account of risk.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Francis Harris  To contact the reporter on this story:
