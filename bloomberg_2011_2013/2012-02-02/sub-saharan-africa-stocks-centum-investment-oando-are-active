investment company, fell for a third day, down 2.5 percent to
13.75 shillings, the lowest since Jan. 20, amid speculation
investors are taking profits.  “It was really oversold in December, then it recovered in
January and now we are seeing very thin profit taking,” George
Bodo, an equity strategist at Nairobi-based Apex Africa Capital
said by phone today.  Oando Plc (OANDO)  , a Nigerian oil company, fell for a
fifth day, slumping 4.6 percent to 16.3 naira, the lowest since
2003. Crude fell to a six-week low in New York as U.S. supplies
climbed and fuel demand tumbled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
