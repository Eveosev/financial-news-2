South Korea’s won jumped to the
strongest level since November and  government bonds  fell as
reports showed manufacturing in the world’s biggest economies
picked up last month.  The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index of shares gained 1.3 percent after the U.S.
Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index climbed to
54.1 from 53.1 in December, the fastest pace in seven months. A
Chinese manufacturing index rose faster than the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey, a separate report showed yesterday.
South Korea’s  foreign-exchange reserves  increased by $4.94
billion to $311.3 billion at the end of January from a month
earlier as the euro and the British pound strengthened against
the dollar, the  Bank of Korea  said today.  “Improving global economic data is supporting the won,”
said Jeon Seung Ji, a Seoul-based currency analyst at Samsung
Futures Inc. “The won didn’t fall much yesterday even after
 South Korea ’s trade balance turned out to be a deficit, and this
signals the market is tilted toward some risk-taking.”  The won gained 0.7 percent to 1,118.35 per dollar at the
close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,117.35 earlier, the strongest since Nov. 14. The
currency fell 0.3 percent yesterday after data showed a $2
billion trade deficit for January.  Overseas funds increased holdings of South Korean stocks in
January by 6.2 trillion won ($5.5 billion), the most on record,
and added to bond investments for the first time in three months,
the Financial Supervisory Service said today. Foreign investors
raised holdings of local-currency bonds by 1.6 trillion won,
after pulling money the debt in the previous two months, the FSS
data showed.  The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due
September 2016 climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 3.49 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
