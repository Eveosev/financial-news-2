European Union imports of sugar from
countries that have preferential access to the bloc’s market
have risen 15 percent so far in the current season, according to
broker and researcher C. Czarnikow Sugar Futures Ltd.  The 27-nation bloc had issued licenses to import 611,000
metric tons of the sweetener as of the second week of January,
the London-based company said in a report e-mailed today. That
compares with 533,000 tons a year earlier, it said.  “Import forecasts for the year stand at approximately 2
million tons, roughly 300,000 tons up on 2010-11 imports,”
according to the report.  A group of some of the least-developed nations and states
in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries have preferential
access to the EU sugar market because they do not have to pay
import duty.  The tariff to import from countries that have no
preferential agreement with the EU is usually 339 euros ($445) a
ton, according to the European Commission, the bloc’s regulatory
arm.  EU supplies fell short of demand last season after
preferential imports were lower than initial estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
