Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
largest oil company, is working on a plan to merge its two
classes of shares, Chief Executive Officer  Peter Voser  told
analysts today.  Shell created the Class A and Class B shares following the
merger of Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. and Shell Transporting &
Trading Co. into Royal Dutch Shell Plc. The new shares started
trading on the London Stock Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam and the
New York Stock Exchange as American Depositary Receipts on July
20, 2005. They  differ  in the way dividends are paid.  “I’m not going to promise anything,” Voser said on a
conference call, referring to tax issues that need to be sorted
out first. “If it comes, you will see us go very fast into the
one-share structure, which then will actually give us all the
flexibility which we need.”  Shell investors and analysts today urged Voser to expand a
share buyback program to return value at a time when the company
is generating additional cash at  oil prices  over $100 a barrel.
The Anglo-Dutch company can only buy back  Class B (RDSB)  shares and not
Class A shares “as a result of withholding tax restrictions,”
Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry said today.  Shell, which will increase its first-quarter dividend to 43
cents from 42 cents announced in the fourth quarter, doesn’t
plan to expand its buyback program, Voser said in an interview
on Bloomberg Television.  “We paid 12 percent of FTSE dividend last year and we are
now showing to our shareholders that we are increasing again,”
Voser said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
