Diwa Guinigundo, deputy governor of
the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in  Manila , comments in an
interview on the possibility of the Philippines using the yuan
as a reserve currency and for trade settlement.  On international reserves:  “We are slowly studying the matter. We hold reserves on
the basis of certain criteria. One of the requirements is for
trade and debt servicing. We don’t have much debt with China.
Most of our loans are denominated in yen and the  U.S. dollar . If
you will choose the denomination of your reserves, you have to
weigh the economic importance of that country that is issuing
that currency.  ‘‘There’s no doubt that China is a very important country.
It’s now the world’s second-largest economy.”  The  Philippines  isn’t ready to use the yuan as a reserve
currency “until such time that you can really justify that
China is actually important to us in terms of investment, trade
and official development assistance and services.  ‘‘Chinese labor is cheaper, so our overseas workers don’t
even go to China. We bring them to the  Middle East  where labor
is in shortage.’’  On trade settlement:  ‘‘We have a very liberal foreign-exchange regulatory
system. We don’t require exporters, whether to China, Japan, or
the U.S., to surrender their foreign-exchange earnings with the
banks. They can keep their money outside of the Philippines.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
