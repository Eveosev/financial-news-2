The average ticket price for the
Super Bowl rematch between the  New York Giants  and  New England
Patriots  has fallen 15 percent in the last six days, according
to sellers on the secondary market.  Seats at the Feb. 5 game at Lucas Oil Stadium in
Indianapolis are selling for an average of $3,664, having fallen
every day since the Jan. 27 high of $4,311, according to TiqIQ,
an event ticket aggregator that tracks listings from resellers
such as StubHub, EBay, TicketNetwork and TicketsNow.  On the  National Football League ’s official ticket resale
site, the NFL Ticket Exchange, at least one sold last week for
$16,480. That price tag was the subject of a  Top Ten list  on CBS
Corp.’s “Late Show” with David Letterman on Jan. 31. Under the
heading, “Top Ten Questions to Ask Yourself Before Spending
$16,000 on a  Super Bowl  Ticket,” the questions included No. 10,
“Do they have anything in the more affordable $15,000 range?”
and No. 7, “Isn’t this why the rest of the world hates us?”  Last year’s Super Bowl, in which the  Green Bay Packers 
topped the Pittsburgh Steelers, was the most-watched show in
U.S. television history with an audience of 111 million,
according to Nielsen Holdings NV. More than 97 million watched
the Giants upset the Patriots 17-14 in February 2008 to win the
Super Bowl and end  New England ’s bid for an undefeated season.  Face-value prices for tickets to this game range from $800
to $1,200. The least expensive ticket on the secondary market is
$2,000, according to TiqIQ.  Online resellers are setting up shop outside the game in
Indianapolis. StubHub will have a ticket center at Pan Am Plaza,
across the street from the stadium, on the morning of the game,
offering fans a “real-time pricing ticker” to help find seats
at the best prices.  Scalpers selling tickets on the street for more than 15
percent of face value must have a temporary license on display,
while those selling tickets below that price point don’t need a
license, according to Indianapolis city officials. Police will
be carrying scanners that can check the authenticity of tickets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
