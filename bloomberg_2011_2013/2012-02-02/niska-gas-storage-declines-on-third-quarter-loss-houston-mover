Niska Gas Storage Partners LLC (NKA) , which
owns and operates natural-gas storage assets in  North America ,
declined after reporting a third-quarter net loss that included
a $250 million goodwill impairment charge.  Niska fell 99 cents, or 10 percent, to $8.66 at 11:27 a.m.
on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares, which dropped as low
as $8.46, have declined 57 percent in the past year. Niska is
based in Houston.  The third-quarter  net loss  was $213.6 million, or $3.07 a
share. Revenue rose to $89.9 million from $45.6 million. The
goodwill impairment charge was taken because of deteriorating
market conditions, Niska said.  The company also announced a cash distribution of 35 cents
a share payable Feb. 16 and a continued suspension of the
distribution on its subordinated units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
