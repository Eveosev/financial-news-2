Robert Bosch GmbH (RBOS) , the world’s
biggest car-parts supplier, plans to invest about 77 million
euros ($101 million) in a new factory in  Romania , the government
said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Bucharest-based government plans to grant state aid to
Bosch to help finance the investment in the factory, located
near the Cluj-Napoca city, in the center of the country,
according to the statement.  “The government is open to support all investments that
create jobs,” Prime Minister Emil Boc said in the statement,
after meeting Bosch representatives today. “I am glad Bosch has
chosen Cluj to expand its operations in Romania, especially
after Nokia closed down its factory in the area.”  Nokia OYJ (NOKIA)  closed its Cluj-Napoca factory last year as part
of a cost cutting program and said on Jan. 25 it will sell the
facilities to  De Longhi Spa (DLG) , an Italian home appliances
manufacturer, without disclosing the terms of the transaction.  De Longhi will also receive state aid from the Romanian
government to help fund the investment in the Cluj-based
factory, the government said in a separate statement, without
disclosing the value of the investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
