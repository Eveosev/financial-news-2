Portugal’s government agreed to sell
a 40 percent stake in  REN-Redes Energeticas Nacionais SA (RENE)  for 592
million euros ($779 million) to State Grid International of
 China  and Oman Oil Co. to meet the terms of a bailout accord.  The price values REN, Portugal’s power and gas grid
operator, at about 150 million euros above its market value,
Secretary of State for Treasury and Finance Maria Luis  Albuquerque  said today. REN shares rose 0.7 percent to close at
2.091 euros in Lisbon, giving it a value of 1.12 billion euros.  State Grid will buy a 25 percent stake and Oman Oil will
buy 15 percent, Albuquerque told reporters in Lisbon. The
Chinese company will pay 387.2 million euros and Oman Oil will
pay 205.1 million euros, she said.  In April,  Portugal  became the third euro-area country after
Greece and Ireland to request a bailout from the European Union
and the  International Monetary Fund . As part of that aid
package, the government agreed to sell its stakes in energy
companies including REN and utility EDP-Energias de Portugal SA.  China Financing  State Grid’s proposal includes 1 billion euros in funds
from China Development Bank Corp. to help REN meet refinancing
needs until 2014 and fulfill its investment plan, Albuquerque
said. The Portuguese company plans to invest 3.2 billion euros
through 2016 in new lines and substations, as well as natural-
gas storage facilities and pipelines.  State Grid is also proposing a partnership with REN in
Angola and  Mozambique , and Oman Oil proposed an expansion of
REN’s gas infrastructure, Albuquerque said.  Chinese companies have been involved in other deals in
Portugal. China Three Gorges Corp. agreed in December to pay
2.69 billion euros for 21 percent of EDP, and refiner China
Petrochemical Corp. said in November it would buy 30 percent of
the Brazilian unit of Galp Energia SGPS SA, Portugal’s biggest
oil company.  Portugal on Dec. 7 said it planned to sell a stake of as
much as 40 percent in Lisbon-based REN. The bidders were
required to present binding proposals to buy 5 percent to 25
percent. The state holds 51 percent of the company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
