Kazakhstan plans to produce 83
million tons of oil this year and may miss the target because
some companies are scaling back output, Oil and Gas Minister
Sauat Mynbayev said at a meeting in the capital, Astana.  Crude oil and gas condensate output reached 80.1 million
tons last year, less than planned by the government and an
increase of 5 percent from the previous year, the ministry said
in a statement distributed today to reporters. Condensate
exports fell 0.5 percent to 71.1 million tons, according to the
statement.  Crude output in Central Asiaâ€™s biggest energy producer was
affected by December riots in an oil-rich region bordering the
 Caspian Sea  in the west of the country that left at least 14
people dead and more than 100 injured.  Ozenmunaigaz, a unit of  KazMunaiGas Exploration Production ,
cut output by more than 19 percent below plan because of a
strike and unrest last year, Mynbayev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
