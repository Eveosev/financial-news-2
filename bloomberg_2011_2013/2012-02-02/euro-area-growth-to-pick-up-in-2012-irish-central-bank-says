Euro-area economic growth will
recover this year after the region’s debt crisis damped
confidence and output, Ireland’s central bank said in its
quarterly bulletin.  “Growth in the euro area is expected to pick up during the
course of 2012 and to improve somewhat further in 2013,” the
Dublin-based institution said in the report today. Still,
“risks to the outlook remain firmly on the downside and relate
to a further intensification of the tensions in euro-area
financial markets and their potential spill-over to the euro
area real economy.”  The ECB last year cut  interest rates  to a historic low and
injected a record 489 billion euros ($643 billion) into the
banking system to unlock credit. The Frankfurt-based ECB
forecasts the economy of the 17-nation euro region will grow 0.3
percent this year and 1.3 percent next year.  “The slowdown in world trade is expected to have a
significant impact on exports and investment” in  Germany , which
has driven euro-area growth in the past two years, the Irish
central bank said. “But overall activity is set to recover
gradually throughout the year as confidence improves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
