Indonesia ’s rupiah fell, retreating
from near a 12-week high, on speculation importers stepped up
purchases of dollars to take advantage of a more favorable
 exchange rate .  The rupiah advanced earlier on optimism investors will plow
more money into emerging-market assets after reports signaled
manufacturing is improving in the U.S. and China. Global funds
added rupiah-denominated government bonds in January at the
fastest pace in 18 months, driving 10-year yields to the lowest
on record.  “Importers may be tempted to buy the dollar especially
noting the fact that we haven’t seen this kind of level for some
time,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp. in  Singapore .  The rupiah weakened 0.2 percent to 9,000 per dollar as of
4:45 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency rose as much as 1.2 percent
to 8,878 earlier, just shy of the 12-week high of 8,875 it
reached on Jan. 25.  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing
index climbed to 54.1, from 53.1 in December.  China ’s Purchasing
Managers’ Index rose to 50.5 from 50.3, an official report
showed. Fifty is the dividing line between contraction and
expansion.  Economists forecast  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy
expanded at an annual pace of  6.45 percent  in the final quarter
of 2011, compared with 6.54 percent in the preceding period,
according to a Bloomberg News survey. The data is due on Feb. 6.  Bond Purchases  Benchmark 10-year notes gained for a sixth day as inflation
cooled. Consumer prices rose 3.65 percent in January from a year
earlier, versus 3.79 percent in December, the government said
yesterday.  The yield on the 7 percent notes due May 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.33 percent,
according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Marketing Association.  Global investors boosted holdings of  government bonds  5.9
percent in January to 236 trillion rupiah ($26.3 billion), the
biggest jump since July 2010, finance ministry  data  show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
