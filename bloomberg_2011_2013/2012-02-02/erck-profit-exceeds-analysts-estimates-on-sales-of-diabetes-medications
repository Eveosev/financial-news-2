Merck & Co. , the second-largest U.S.
drugmaker, reported fourth-quarter profit that topped analyst
estimates on higher sales of the Januvia diabetes drug. The
company forecast 2012 earnings that matched estimates.  Net income  was $1.51 billion, or 49 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $531 million, or 17 cents, a year earlier when
Merck took a $1.7 billion charge to write down the value of an
experimental blood thinner, the  Whitehouse Station , New Jersey-
based company said today in a statement. Earnings excluding one-
time items of 97 cents a share beat by 2 cents the  average of 18
analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Merck forecast full-year earnings excluding one-time items
of $3.75 to $3.85 a share, in range of analyst estimates of
$3.84. The company is trimming jobs to reduce costs as it
prepares for generic competition to the asthma medication
Singulair, coming in August. Merck introduced a hepatitis C drug
last year and is working on another.  “In terms of top line, it is a modest growth,” said Aparna
Krishnan, an analyst at IHS Global Insight in  London , in a phone
interview. “They face lots of pressure in 2012. It is going to
be very challenging.”  Revenue (MRK)  rose 1.7 percent to $12.3 billion, less than the
analyst estimates of $12.5 billion.  Sales of Januvia for diabetes jumped 42 percent to $960
million, while revenue of the company’s human papillomavirus
vaccine Gardasil increased 24 percent to $274 million.  Vytorin Decline  Those gains were countered by a 16 percent decline in sales
for the cholesterol drug Vytorin and a 28 percent drop for the
arthritis drug Remicade. In July, Merck transferred exclusive
Remicade marketing rights in South and Central America, the
 Middle East ,  Canada ,  Africa , and Asia Pacific to  Johnson &
Johnson. (JNJ)   “It was a decent fourth-quarter overall,” said  Timothy Anderson , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein analyst in  New
York , in a note to clients today.  Merck fell less than 1 percent to $38.44 at 4:00 p.m. in
New York trading.  Merck said that it expected 2012 sales to be “at or near”
2011 levels on a constant currency basis. Assuming current
exchange rates, sales would decline 2 percent to 3 percent from
2011, the company said. Analysts had expected 2012 sales of
$47.6 billion. The company said that research and development
spending would be little changed in 2012.  In a separate statement, Merck said today that the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration approved a once-daily formulation
of its Janumet, which combines Januvia with the older diabetes
drug metformin. The older Janumet formulation is given twice
daily.  To contact the reporter on this story:
