University of  Akron   hired former
 Ohio State University  football coach  Jim Tressel  as an
administrator, less than one year after he resigned from the
Buckeyes amid an investigation into rules violations.  Tressel, 59, fills the school’s new job as vice president
of strategic engagement, Akron said on its  website . He will be
responsible for managing relations between the Akron student
body and its alumni and local community.  The job has a base salary of $200,000, according to the
school. Tressel was scheduled to make almost $3.6 million in
total compensation last year at Ohio State, based on a 2010
addendum to his contract.  A native of northeast Ohio, Tressel received his master’s
degree in education from Akron in 1977. He served as a Zips
assistant coach from 1975 to 1978.  He resigned from  Ohio  State in May, after a National
Collegiate Athletic Association investigation revealed he knew
about rules infractions by some of his players, who had sold or
traded memorabilia to the owner of a tattoo parlor. The school
vacated all 12 of its wins in the 2010 season, including a Sugar
Bowl victory, following the NCAA investigation.  In September, Tressel was hired by the  National Football
League ’s Indianapolis Colts as a game-day adviser. Last month,
after the ouster of coach Jim Caldwell, Tressel interviewed
twice for the position, according to WBNS-TV in Columbus. The
team later hired Chuck Pagano to replace Caldwell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
