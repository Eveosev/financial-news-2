Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the
world’s largest producer of the metal, agreed to buy two
projects from  Anooraq Resources Corp. (ARQ) , which will use the $213
million in proceeds to cut its debt to Amplats.  Amplats will buy the Boikgantsho project and the eastern
section of the Ga-Phasha project, Anooraq said in a statement
today. Anooraq will still hold a 51 percent stake in the greater
Bokoni Platinum Mine, with Amplats retaining a 49 percent
interest.  “This transaction provides Amplats with access to mineral
properties that provide synergies with our operations at
Mogalakwena and Twickenham,” Amplats Chief Executive Officer
Neville Nicolau said in the statement.  As part of the reorganization, the two companies agreed to
halt interest on Anooraq’s debt, resulting in a $37.5 million
saving for Anooraq. All debt owed to Amplats will also be
consolidated into one facility, it said.  Anooraq will use the savings and proceeds to reduce its
debt to Amplats by 66 percent to about $125 million.  Anooraq rallied 14 percent to 4.63 rand, the highest since
Oct. 14, by 4:52 p.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
