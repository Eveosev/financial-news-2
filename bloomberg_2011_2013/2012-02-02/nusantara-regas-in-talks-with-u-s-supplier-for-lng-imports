PT Nusantara Regas is in talks with a
U.S supplier to import liquefied natural gas to take advantage
of cheap supplies.  Regas plans to import as much as 2 million metric tons of
LNG a year with first cargoes expected in the first-quarter of
2017 if talks succeed, President-Director Hendra Jaya told
reporters in Jakarta late yesterday, declining to name the
company. The company, a venture between Indonesia’s state oil
company PT Pertamina and the country’s largest gas distributor
 PT Perusahan Gas Negara (PGAS) , is building a floating LNG terminal
near West Java province.  Asia ’s LNG buyers are turning to  North America  to benefit
from a 56 percent drop in benchmark U.S. gas prices over the
past two years as production from shale deposits has raised
supply. Indonesia is the world’s second-largest exporter of LNG.  “We are negotiating with one potential supplier. The price
of U.S LNG can still compete with the price we get from domestic
supplier,” said Jaya. The terminal, which will be jointly
operated with  Golar LNG Energy Ltd. (GOLE) , is expected to start
operation by early second quarter of this year, he said.  Regas is building a floating storage regasification
facility with a capacity of more than 3 million tons a year, it
said on its  website . It has secured 1.5 million tons of supply
from the Bontang plant in East Kalimantan province on
 Indonesia ’s part of Borneo island.  To contact the reporter on this story:
