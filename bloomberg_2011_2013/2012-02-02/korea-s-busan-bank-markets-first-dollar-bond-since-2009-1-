Busan Bank (005280)  started marketing a five-
year dollar-denominated bond, its first note in the U.S.
currency since May 2009, according to Ahn Soo Il, a spokesman
for the Korean lender.  The notes are priced to yield about 385 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, two people familiar with the
matter said, asking not to be identified as the details are
private.  Citigroup Inc., Credit Agricole SA and UBS AG are managing
the offering, one of the people said.  The South Korean bank has more than  2.53 trillion  won
($2.26 billion) of bonds maturing by the end of 2018, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
