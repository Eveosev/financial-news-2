Orco Property Group SA (ORCO) , a developer
overhauling its business and debt under a court-approved plan,
rose for a seventh day in Czech trading, headed for its longest
streak of gains in three years.  The stock traded up 5.9 percent to 108 koruna by 9:48 a.m.
in Prague. A close at that level would be Orcoâ€™s highest since
Sept. 21 and would mark the longest rally since the seven days
ended Jan. 7, 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
