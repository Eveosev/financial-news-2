Gasoline fell as U.S.  demand  for the
motor fuel reached a 10-year low and supplies of the motor fuel
rose to the highest level in 11 months.  Futures dropped as much as 1.8 percent a day after the
Energy Department reported that fuel supplied to wholesalers
sank 1.6 percent last week to 7.97 million barrels a day, the
lowest level since September 2001.  Gasoline inventories  rose
3.02 million barrels last week to 230.1 million.  “We are in February and driving demand is really low,”
said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy
in Stamford, Connecticut. “You’re getting some technical
selling. It looks like the market couldn’t push up past $2.90
and hold there.”  Gasoline for March delivery fell 3.96 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.8526 a gallon at 1:51 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices touched $2.841.  Prices briefly rose to $2.8986 after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the economy has shown signs of
improvement.  “Fortunately, over the past few months, indicators of
spending, production, and job-market activity have shown some
signs of improvement,” Bernanke said today, according to
prepared testimony to the House Budget Committee in  Washington .
“The outlook remains uncertain, however, and close monitoring
of economic developments will remain necessary.”  Bernanke Comments  Bernanke repeated the Federal Open Market Committee’s Jan.
25 statement that the outlook for the economy would likely
warrant near-zero  interest rates  through at least late 2014. The
FOMC also established an inflation goal of 2 percent, achieving
Bernanke’s longstanding aim to reduce “public uncertainty”
about monetary policy.  Demand for the motor fuel over the past four weeks was 7.3
percent below a year earlier. Total fuel consumption was down
4.3 percent year-over-year.  “Bernanke’s announcement gave us a little bit of
support,”  Phil Flynn , analyst at PFGBest in  Chicago , said by
phone. “But right now as far as energy demand we need more than
Goldilocks, we need some strong growth, especially over the next
couple of weeks as we head into the shoulder season with a whole
bunch of supply.”  March-delivery heating oil slipped 0.86 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $3.0369 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.5
cent to $3.455 yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
