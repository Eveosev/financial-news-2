Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , the biggest maker of
motor fuel from coal, asked closely held BrightSource Energy
Inc. to study the design of a solar-thermal power plant in South
Africa.  The solar company, based in Oakland, California, will work
with  Alstom SA (ALO) , the world’s third-largest power-equipment maker,
to determine how Sasol can “best deploy BrightSource’s
technology,” according to a statement today.  The study, which will probably be for a plant of about 125
megawatts, will be completed by the third quarter, Henri Loubser, head of Johannesburg-based Sasol’s new-energy unit,
said on a conference call today. If the study is positive, an
 investment decision  will be made in the first half of 2013,
Loubser said.  South Africa  “meets more than 85 percent of its power
needs with coal,” BrightSource Chief Executive Officer John Woolard said in the release.  South Africa’s Department of Energy is seeking to add 3,725
megawatts of renewable power by 2016, as the country’s total
energy supply more than doubles to at least 85 gigawatts over
the next 20 years, according to the statement.  Solar-thermal plants use mirrors or lenses to focus
sunlight and heat liquids, creating steam that drives a turbine.  To contact the reporters on this story:
