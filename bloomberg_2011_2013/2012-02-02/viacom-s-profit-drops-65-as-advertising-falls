Viacom Inc (VIAB) . fell the most in two
months after reporting fiscal first-quarter revenue below
analysts’ estimates and a 3 percent decline in advertising sales
at the cable-television unit that includes MTV and Nickelodeon.   The stock  slumped 3.1 percent to $45.40 at 9:41 a.m. in New
York before, after touching $45.18 for the biggest intraday
decline since Dec. 1. Net income in the period ended Dec. 31
dropped 65 percent, hurt by costs of $383 million related to a
dispute with the former shareholders of Harmonix, creator of the
“Rock Band” video games, sold in 2010, the company said.  Nickelodeon’s audience shrank during the Christmas holiday
period, the childrens network’s biggest quarter of the year,
according to Nielsen Holdings NV.  Nickelodeon (CBS)  contributes about
15 percent of Viacom’s cable-TV advertising revenue annually and
25 percent during the December quarter,  Mike Morris , an analyst
with Davenport & Co., wrote in a Jan. 10 note.  Viacom will lift ratings at Nickelodeon with new programs
throughout the year, Chief Executive Officer  Philippe Dauman 
said at an investor conference in December.  Net income fell to $212 million, or 38 cents a share, in
the period ended Dec. 31, compared with $610 million, or $1, a
year earlier, New York-based Viacom said today in a statement.  Excluding the Harmonix charge and other items, profit of
$1.06 beat the average of analysts’ estimates by 1 cent.  Sales climbed 3.2 percent to $3.95 billion. Analysts
predicted $3.99 billion on average.  Cable  networks  contributed 92 percent of Viacom’s fiscal
2011 operating income, with the remainder coming from its
Paramount Pictures film studio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
