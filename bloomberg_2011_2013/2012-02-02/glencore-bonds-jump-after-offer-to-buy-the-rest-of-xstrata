Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  bonds
surged to a record after miner  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  said it was in talks
with the world’s largest listed commodity trader.  Glencore’s 1.25 billion euros of 5.25 percent bonds due
March 2017 rose to 105.6 cents on the euro to yield 4 percent,
after advancing to as much as 107.6, Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices show. The cost to insure the Baar, Switzerland-based
firm’s debt against default fell to a seven-month low.  Glencore made an approach about an all-share offer for “a
merger of equals,” Zug, Switzerland-based Xstrata said today in
a statement. Glencore, which already holds a  34 percent stake  in
the miner, said there was no certainty of an offer.  “The worst-case scenario would be that they did a hostile
debt-financed takeover attempt,” said Michael Ridley, an energy
and utilities credit analyst at Mizuho International Plc in
 London . “That was a slight fear in the bond markets, but
sensibly, given that they’re trying to do a merger, they want to
do a share-swap merger.”  Credit-default swaps tied to Glencore’s debt dropped 54
basis points to 265 basis points at 11 a.m., the lowest since
July 4, according to CMA. A decline in the price of the debt-
insurance contracts indicates improvement in perceptions of
 credit quality .  A share-funded acquisition is “much less credit negative”
and means Glencore would probably keep its  investment-grade 
rating, Ridley said. The commodities trader is ranked Baa2 by
Moody’s Investors Service and an equivalent BBB at  Standard &
Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
