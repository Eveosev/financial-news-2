BP Plc (BP/)  has started shipping crude oil
westward on the trans- Panama  pipeline, the company said in an e-
mailed statement.  BP will ship 100,000 barrels a day to Panama’s Pacific
Coast port of Charco Azul, where it will be loaded on tankers
bound for U.S. West Coast refineries. Crude  oil tankers  too
large to traverse the Panama Canal usually go around Cape Horn,
according to the statement.  BP also leased 5.4 million barrels of storage on the
Caribbean and Pacific coasts from the pipeline operator,
Petroterminal de Panama, the company said.  The storage on both coasts and the westward flow of oil
“will provide U.S. West Coast refiners with more diverse and
flexible supply options,” Paul Reed, chief executive of BP’s
integrated supply and trading organization, said in the
statement. “This overland route greatly reduces transit times
and lowers freight costs for many of our customers.”  The trans-Panama pipeline’s capacity is 600,000 barrels a
day, the company said.  The pipeline was  built in 1982  to ship Alaska North Slope
crude to refineries in U.S. Gulf Coast and the Caribbean,
according to the Energy Department. The pipeline was shut down
in 1996, and the flow reversal was completed in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
