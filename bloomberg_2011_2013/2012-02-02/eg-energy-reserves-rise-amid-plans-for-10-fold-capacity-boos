MEG Energy Corp. (MEG) , the Canadian oil-
sands producer part-owned by  China ’s  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , increased its
proved crude reserves 17 percent last year as it targets a 10-
fold increase in capacity.  Reserves expanded to 708 million barrels from 606 million
in 2010, the Calgary-based company said in a statement today.
MEG Energy, which produced an average of 26,605 barrels a day
last year, plans to increase spending by 52 percent this year as
part of a goal to boost its capacity to produce bitumen from
 Alberta ’s oil sands to 260,000 barrels a day by 2020.  MEG Energy plans to spend C$1.37 billion ($1.37 billion)
this year, from C$900 million in 2011, as it increases capacity
at its Christina Lake project and develops new resources at
Surmont. The company estimates as much as 2.06 billion barrels
of proved and probable  reserves  in its lease holdings.  The shares  rose  4.1 percent to C$46.50 at the close in
Toronto, the biggest gain since Nov. 28. MEG Energy has gained
31 percent since it began trading in 2010.  Fourth-quarter net income rose to C$91.1 million, or 46
cents a share, from C$61.3 million, or 31 cents, a year earlier,
the company reported today. MEG Energy was  expected  to earn 22
cents a share, the average of 12 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Cnooc purchased a 16.69 percent stake in MEG Energy in 2005
for C$150 million. The Beijing-based company is the second-
largest shareholder in MEG Energy, behind Warburg Pincus LLC,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
