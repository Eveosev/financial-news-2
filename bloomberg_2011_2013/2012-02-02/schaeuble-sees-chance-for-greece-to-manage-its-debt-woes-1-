German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said he sees a chance for  Greece  to manage its debt
woes provided the country fulfills the commitments under its
economic adjustment program.  “Greece needs a new program, there’s no question about
that, but Greece itself must create the conditions for it,”
Schaeuble said today in an interview on n-tv television. “We
can’t pay into a bottomless pit.”  The public sector doesn’t need to contribute more to the
second aid program for Greece over 130 billion euros ($171
billion) “because we’re shouldering everything anyway,” he
said. Private creditors should contribute because “they made
sufficient profits earlier and cashed in on the high bond
yields.”  European Union leaders left a Jan. 30 summit in Brussels
without an accord over how to plug Greece’s widening budget
hole. Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said he would try to
meet German-led demands for a bigger debt writedown by investors
and deeper budget cuts by his government.  “Greece is the most difficult case, but also a very
special one,” Schaeuble said, declining to answer the question
whether Greece might need a third aid program. Asked whether he
thinks the euro region’s composition will be the same at the end
of the year, Schaeuble said “I hope so.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
