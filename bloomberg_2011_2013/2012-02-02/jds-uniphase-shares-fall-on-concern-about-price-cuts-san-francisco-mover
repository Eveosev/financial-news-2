JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU) , the biggest maker
of fiber-optic testing equipment, fell in U.S. trading after UBS
AG downgraded the stock on concern that the company is cutting
prices.  The shares  tumbled 7.2 percent to $12.19 at the close in
 New York , the biggest drop in more than three months. The stock
is down 32 percent in the past 12 months.  UBS lowered its rating to “neutral” from “buy,” citing
price cuts of 6 percent this quarter for the company’s optical
products. In a separate report, Morgan Stanley analysts also
expressed concern about the lower prices, saying they were
putting pressure on profit margins. The cuts are affecting
rivals Finisar Corp. and Oclaro Inc. as well, analysts said.  “Struggling competitors apparently pushed pricing lower,”
 Ehud Gelblum , an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, said in
the report.  JDS Uniphase, based in Milpitas, California, is forecasting
sales of $410 million to $425 million for the fiscal third
quarter, which ends in March. Analysts estimate $419.3 million
on average, according to a  Bloomberg survey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
