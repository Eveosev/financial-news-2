Iceland’s  Economic Affairs  Ministry
handed in a pre-accession economic program to the European
Commission as a part of a bid to join the 27-nation bloc.  The program “sets out Iceland’s main economic priorities
until 2014,” according to an e-mailed press release from the
ministry.  The reports outlines economic policy priorities, the
macroeconomic outlook, government finances and the medium-term
fiscal program, as well as newly adopted and planned structural
changes in policy areas. The government said in the report that
economic outlook was based on an assessment in November.  Iceland started EU entry talks in July 2010 and will
probably vote on accession in early 2013. Of a total of 35
negotiating chapters for EU accession, Iceland has opened 11 and
completed eight, the EU said in December. The primary challenges
facing the talks are in matters relating to agriculture,
environment and fisheries, according to EU Enlargement
Commissioner Stefan Fule.  Half of Icelanders support the accession negotiations,
according to a January poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
