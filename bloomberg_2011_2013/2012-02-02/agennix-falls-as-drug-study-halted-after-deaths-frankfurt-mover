Agennix AG (AGX)  fell the most in more than
two years in Frankfurt trading after a study of its experimental
sepsis drug was halted because more patients receiving the
treatment died than those who got a placebo.  Agennix declined 30 percent to 1.88 euros at the close of
trading, giving the company a market value of 96.4 million euros
($126.8 million). The decline was the biggest for the company
since it began trading in November 2009.  A safety-monitoring board recommended halting enrollment
and treatment in the clinical trial of talactoferrin,
Martinsried, Germany-based Agennix said in a statement today.
Mortality in the talactoferrin arm of the OASIS trial was
greater than in the placebo arm, the company said.  “Agennix is unblinding the data from the trial to better
understand these results,” the company said. “A review will be
initiated immediately, and, once completed, the company will
determine its next steps regarding the development of
talactoferrin in severe sepsis and provide additional
information regarding the results of the study.”  The results should have no affect on the Fortis-M trial of
talactoferrin in non-small cell lung cancer, Agennix said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
