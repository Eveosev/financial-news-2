Norway ’s registered jobless rate fell
from a year earlier as companies sought more workers and the
oil-rich nation escapes the worst of Europe’s debt crisis.  Norway’s registered unemployment rate fell to 2.8 percent
in January from 3.1 percent a year earlier, the Oslo-based Labor
and Welfare Organization said today. The figure was in line with
the median estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The country’s central bank in December cut its benchmark
 interest rate  by 50 basis points to 1.75 percent to shield the
world’s seventh-largest oil exporter from the fallout of
Europe’s debt crisis. The nation sends more than 60 percent of
its exports to the region.  “Unemployment has fallen markedly and demand for labor has
increased through January,” said Joakim Lystad, a director at
the agency, in the statement. “This shows that Norway is so far
little affected by the crisis in  Europe .”  The number of vacant jobs grew by 12 percent in January
from a year earlier, the agency said. Seasonally adjusted, the
number of unemployed fell to 64,158 people, the lowest since
February 2009, from 72,920 a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
