Detroit (9845MFUS)  Mayor Dave Bing and a
majority of city employee unions have reached tentative
agreement on concessions aimed at avoiding a state takeover.  “This agreement is the first meaningful step in achieving
the necessary concessions and structural changes,” Bing, 68,
said via Twitter.  The deal, but no details, was confirmed by Al Garrett,
president of AFSCME Council 25. The agreement covers about 6,500
of the city’s about 11,000 employees, not including police and
firefighters who have resisted a demand for a 10 percent wage
cut, he said.  The city and unions must agree to concessions early this
month to avoid state action, such as the appointment of an
emergency manager with broad powers to cut spending, said state
Treasurer Andy Dillon. Dillon is leading a review of city
finances, after a preliminary review found it will run out of
cash by May, and that it faces a $200 million operating deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
