OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  Neft, the oil arm of the
world’s biggest natural-gas producer, is interested in buying
 OMV AG (OMV) ’s filling stations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.  “We will pursue projects if they create added value,”
Deputy Chief Executive Officer Vadim Yakovlev said today in  St.
Petersburg . Gazprom Neft has the “financial capacity” for
acquisitions, he said.  OMV, a Vienna-based  oil company , said Dec. 6 that it plans
to sell its Balkan subsidiaries as it seeks to dispose of 1
billion euros ($1.3 billion) of less profitable assets. The
Croatian unit has 63 filling stations and a market share of
about 13 percent, while in Bosnia, OMV has 28 filling stations
and an 8 percent share, it said in December.  The sale has also attracted interest from  OAO Zarubezhneft (ZRNFT) ,
a Russian oil-pipeline operator, which said last month that it
had submitted an offer for the filling stations in Bosnia-
Herzegovina and  Croatia .  Gazprom Neft isn’t interested in buying  Petroplus Holding
AG (PPHN) ’s plants in  Europe , Yakovlev also said. Zug, Switzerland-
based Petroplus filed for insolvency last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
