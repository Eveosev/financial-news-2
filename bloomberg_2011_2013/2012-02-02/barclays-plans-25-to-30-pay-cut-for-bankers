Barclays Plc (BARC) , the British lender run
by  Robert Diamond , plans to cut compensation for the 24,000
employees at its investment banking unit by as much as 30
percent, two people with knowledge of the talks said.  The lender is preparing to tell employees at Barclays
Capital next week that overall pay will be down by 25 percent to
30 percent on average from a year earlier, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the plans haven’t yet been
made public. The bank will also  eliminate  about 5 percent of its
senior bankers, said the people. Those at risk typically hold
titles such as executive directors and managing directors.  The world’s biggest lenders are curbing pay as they grapple
with declining revenue. Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG
and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  have all reduced senior investment bankers’
pay for last year as revenue slows.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany ’s
largest, today said it reduced compensation for employees at its
corporate and investment bank by 15 percent.  Barclays also plans to cut remuneration for more junior
employees such as vice presidents, associates and analysts, the
people said. The London-based bank plans to reduce pay for
third-year vice presidents, which can be as much as $750,000 a
year, by about $100,000, the people said.  The reduction will trigger similar pay cuts for more junior
vice presidents, associates and analysts, the people said. In
past years, base pay for junior bankers, who typically comprise
three-fourths of a Wall Street firm’s employees, would rise by
15 percent to 20 percent annually, even in lean years, the
people said.  Shrinking Earnings  Kerrie-Ann Cohen, a  Barclays Capital  spokeswoman in  New
York , declined to comment on compensation and firings. The
 stock , which fell 33 percent in 2011, rose 1.7 percent to 227.9
pence in  London  today, for a market value of 27.8 billion pounds
($44 billion).  Barclays reports full-year  earnings  on Feb. 10. Net income
for the full year may fall 12 percent to 3.14 billion pounds
from 3.56 billion pounds, according to the median estimate of 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Investment banking  revenue  fell 12 percent to 2.25 billion
pounds in the third quarter, the lender said in October. The
lender said at the time it had eliminated 3,500 jobs in 2011.  Banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain may eliminate
11,000 jobs in the first three months of this year after cutting
9,000 jobs in the fourth quarter, according to estimates by the
 Confederation of British Industry , Britain’s biggest business
lobby group. Financial firms in Britain may have shed almost a
tenth of their employees by the end of the first quarter since
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s collapse, the CBI said.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , Britain’s biggest
government-owned bank, said last month it will cut about 4,800
jobs, including 3,500 at its investment bank over the next three
years, as the Edinburgh-based lender jettisons unprofitable cash
equities and merger-advisory operations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
