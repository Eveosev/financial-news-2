Great Portland Estates Plc (GPOR) , a
property developer focused on  London ’s West End district, said
its buildings appreciated by 2.6 percent excluding acquisitions
and disposals in the fourth quarter as overseas buyers fueled
demand for London properties.  The value of Great Portland’s real estate was 1.9 billion
pounds ($3 billion) at the end of last year, a gain of 45.9
million pounds from Sept. 30, the company said today in a
statement. Net asset value rose 2.1 percent to 386 pence a
share.  Overseas buyers with 40 billion pounds of cash are
targeting London for investment, broker Knight Frank LLP said
yesterday. A lack of debt finance is restricting new
developments and property owners will benefit as a result when
economic growth returns, Great Portland said.  “Investor demand, particularly from overseas, remains
strong whilst tenant take-up has increased over the quarter to
the long run average level,” Chief Executive Officer Toby Courtauld said in the statement.  Great Portland’s developments rose 9.1 percent in value
during the quarter, the company said in the statement, after
they were revalued because of rental growth. They include
Hanover Square, a development of shops and offices in Mayfair.  To contact the reporter on this story:
