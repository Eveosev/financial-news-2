U.S. food-stamp use, which
Republicans have cited as evidence of a failing economy, rose to
a record in November.  About 46.286 million Americans received aid, up 0.1 percent
from 46.225 million in October, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in an e-mail. Participation was 6.2
percent higher than a year earlier. The government spent $6.22
billion on the program for the month, up 6.9 percent from 2010.  Food stamps have become a theme in this year’s presidential
campaign, as enrollment has increased 46 percent since December
2008, a month before President  Barack Obama  took office. Annual
spending has more than doubled in four years to a record  $75.3
billion , a level called unsustainable by Republicans including
 Newt Gingrich , who has labeled Obama “the best food-stamp
president in American history.”  Joblessness (USURTOT)  fell to 8.5 percent in December from 8.7
percent in November, the Labor Department said last month. The
January estimate will be released tomorrow.  The number of Americans receiving assistance under the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the initiative
better-known as  food stamps , set records every month from
December 2008 until June 2011. The previous record was in
September, when 46.268 million Americans received aid.  About 34 percent of food-stamp recipients are white, 22
percent are black and 16 percent Hispanic, with the rest being
Asian, Native American or those who chose not to identify their
race, according to the USDA, which administers the program.
 About half  are younger than 18, and 8 percent are older than 60.
Some 41 percent of all recipients live in households where
family members are employed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
