Israeli police used stun grenades
to stop about 500 Muslims trying to make their way to the U.S.
Consulate in Jerusalem after prayers on the Temple Mount.  Four people were arrested and the crowd has been dispersed,
police spokesman  Micky Rosenfeld  said in a telephone interview.
The Israeli police increased forces in and around Jerusalem’s
Old City before today’s Muslim prayers to prevent disturbances
such as those elsewhere in the region, Rosenfeld said.  Protests at U.S. missions sparked by about a film about the
Prophet Muhammad have spread to several Islamic countries, and
the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three colleagues were killed in
an attack in Benghazi. The U.S. Embassy in Israel issued a
travel warning yesterday, cautioning American citizens about the
possibility of demonstrations in Jerusalem and the  West Bank .  In Gaza, thousands of Palestinians demonstrated against the
film. Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader in the  Gaza Strip , told
worshippers at a mosque that the movie “is an assault on Islam
and Muslims all over the world.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
