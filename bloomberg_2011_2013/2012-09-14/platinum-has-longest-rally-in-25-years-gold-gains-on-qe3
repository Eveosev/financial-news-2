Platinum rose, capping the longest
rally in 25 years, after the  Federal Reserve  took steps to
bolster the  U.S. economy  and as strikes halted output at mines
in  South Africa , the world’s largest producer. Gold advanced.  The Fed yesterday said it will expand its holdings of long-
term securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of
mortgage debt a month in a third round of quantitative easing.
Workers at a Lonmin Plc mine and nearby operations of Anglo
American Platinum Ltd., the biggest producer, are holding
protests over pay.  “Today’s rally can be attributed partly to the easing
announced yesterday,” Marc Ground, a commodity strategist at
Standard Bank Plc in Johannesburg, said in a telephone
interview. “The fundamentals remain supportive.”  Platinum for immediate delivery rose 1.5 percent to
$1,709.65 an ounce at 3:10 p.m.  New York  time. The price climbed
for the 11th straight session, the longest rally since at least
January 1987. Earlier, the metal reached $1,715.70, the highest
since Feb. 29.  The spot price has jumped 22 percent since Aug. 10, when
violence that left 45 people dead started at Lonmin’s Marikana
operation.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery gained 2 percent to settle at $1,713.70.
Palladium futures for December delivery rose 1.5 percent to
$699.30 an ounce. The metal climbed for the 10th straight
session, the longest rally since June 2000.  Gold Rally  Gold futures for delivery in December rose 60 cents to
$1,772.70 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the price
reached $1,780.20, the highest since Feb. 29.  “With the prospect of further liquidity flowing into the
market, gold will likely maintain its upward momentum,”  James Moore , an analyst at Basemetals.com in  London , said in an e-
mail.  Yesterday, holdings in exchange-traded products backed by
gold rose to a record for the eighth straight session, reaching
2,492.95 metric tons, data tracked by Bloomberg showed.  Silver futures for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$34.656 an ounce on the Comex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
