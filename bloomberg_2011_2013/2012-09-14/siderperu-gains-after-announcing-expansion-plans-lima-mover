Empresa Siderurgica del Peru SAA , a
unit of steelmaker  Gerdau SA (GGBR4) , jumped the most in 14 months after
announcing expansion plans.  The company, known as Siderperu, gained 6.3 percent to 67
centimos at the close in  Lima , the biggest intraday gain since
July 18, 2011. The stock has dropped 44 percent over the past 12
months.  Gerdau, which took over Siderperu in 2006, plans to invest
$253 million to quadruple annual laminated steel output to 1.4
million tons to handle growing domestic demand. The expansion
plan will add a 360,000 metric ton-per-year blast furnace at the
steel mill located in the northern port of Chimbote, Siderperu
said yesterday in a corporate filing.  Siderperu suspended investment plans and shut a blast
furnace in 2008 as a global recession curbed steel demand.  “Investors reacted to the investment announcement, which
means they will reopen the mill,” Jose Luis Bustamante, Lima-
based head of trading at Cartisa SAB, said today in a telephone
interview. “Gerdau has been importing steel instead of
producing locally, but now fuel costs have risen.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
