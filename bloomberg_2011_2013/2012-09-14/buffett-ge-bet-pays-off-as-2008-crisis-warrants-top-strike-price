General Electric Co.’s (GE)  gain of more
than 20 percent this year is validating Warren Buffett’s $3
billion wager that the world’s largest maker of  jet engines 
would rebound after the financial crisis.  GE climbed as high as $22.37 in New York, exceeding the
$22.25 strike price of five-year warrants for the first time
since Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  agreed to buy them in
 October 2008 . The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company has more
than tripled since falling to $6.66, the lowest closing price in
more than 16 years, in March 2009.  Berkshire purchased the warrants and $3 billion in
preferred stock in an investment that helped Chief Executive
Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  raise cash as credit losses mounted at
GE’s finance unit in late 2008 after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. The CEO’s efforts to shrink GE Capital
and boost earnings from industrial units have led to a rebound
in investor confidence.  “It was very critical at that point for GE to attract
someone like  Warren Buffett ,” said Zahid Siddique, a portfolio
manager at Rye, New York-based Gabelli & Co. who manages $1.4
billion including GE shares. “It showed confidence in the
companies as well as in the broader  U.S. economy . They’ve done
OK in the time that’s passed.”  Goldman Sachs  Buffett’s investment in GE was patterned on a $5 billion
purchase of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. preferred shares and
warrants a week earlier, a transaction that helped shore up the
most profitable firm in Wall Street history as it transformed
itself into a bank to become eligible for bailout funds from the
U.S. government.  The Berkshire CEO called GE “the backbone of American
industry” and praised Immelt and  Jack Welch , his predecessor,
in an Oct. 1, 2008, interview on CNBC.  “They’re going to be around five or 10 or 100 years from
now,” Buffett said. “If you buy at the right time, you’ll
probably make some money.”  As financial firms reduced lending to hoard capital in
2008, Berkshire bought preferred shares of GE and Goldman Sachs
and pledged to help finance takeovers by Dow Chemical Co. and
Mars Inc. in exchange for stakes in those companies. GE paid
$3.3 billion in October 2011 to redeem Berkshire’s preferred
stock.  In addition to Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire’s
investment, Immelt raised $12 billion by selling common stock in
October 2008. He later announced plans to jettison some of  GE
Capital ’s real estate investments and cut GE’s annual  dividend 
to shareholders for the first time since 1938.  Credit Rating  Those moves didn’t keep  Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s
Investors Services from stripping the company of its top  credit
rating  or prevent the shares from falling to the lowest level
since November 1992.  GE has climbed from $18.36 on Jan. 3 as GE Capital received
Federal Reserve approval to resume an internal payout to its
parent that had been suspended as the financial crisis deepened.
The stock pared earlier gains to close at $22.11 in New York, an
increase of 0.4 percent.  Goldman climbed 0.6 percent to $121.36, above the $115
strike price on Berkshire’s warrants. The New York-based firm
paid $5.65 billion to redeem the preferred stock in April 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
