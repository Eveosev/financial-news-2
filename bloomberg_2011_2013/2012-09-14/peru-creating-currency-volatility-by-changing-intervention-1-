Peru ’s central bank will make it
more difficult for traders to predict currency movements by
 purchasing dollars  when the sol is depreciating as well as when
it is strengthening, bank President Julio Velarde said.  The bank will buy dollars each day at a price that will
vary to ensure an “element of uncertainty,” Velarde told
reporters in  Lima .  Policy makers are seeking to make the currency movements
less predictable as the sol’s appreciation and low volatility
fuel growing demand for credit in dollars. Banco Central de
Reserva del Peru has bought a record $10.5 billion this year to
limit appreciation in the sol. It sold $676 million in May as
the sol weakened.  “We’re buying fixed quantities to introduce more
volatility because previously, the view of some agents was when
depreciation started, the buying stopped,” Velarde said. “We
won’t stop buying if the currency is weakening. We’ll see how
that works.”  The central bank has bought dollars every day this month,
in amounts ranging from $40 million to $100 million. It bought
$80 million in the spot currency market today and paid an
average 2.5967 soles per  U.S. dollar .  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.5950 per U.S. dollar today,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. That is the sol’s
strongest level since 1997, data from Peru’s financial regulator
show. The sol has appreciated 5.3 percent in the past year, the
best performance among major emerging-market currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
