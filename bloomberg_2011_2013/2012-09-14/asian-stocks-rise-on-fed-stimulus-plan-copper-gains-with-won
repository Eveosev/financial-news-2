Stocks rallied around the world,
commodities surged and the dollar slid as the  Federal Reserve ’s
plan to buy mortgage securities fueled demand for riskier
assets. Oil rose to a four-month high and Treasuries sank.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  gained 0.4 percent to
1,465.77 at 4 p.m. in  New York , its highest level since December
2007. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index jumped 3.3 percent in its
biggest gain since June. The S&P GSCI gauge of 24 commodities
rose for a seventh day, climbing to its highest level in five
months, as nickel surged more than 6 percent to lead gains. The
 Dollar Index  dropped as much as 0.8 percent and touched the
weakest level since February.  The Fed said yesterday it will expand holdings of long-term
securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of mortgage
debt a month and hold the  federal funds rate  near zero until at
least the middle of 2015. U.S. equities also advanced after a
gauge of  consumer confidence  topped forecasts. The MSCI All-
Country World Index rose to the highest level since July 2011.  “Very aggressive accommodative policies have very strong
impacts on equity markets,” Andrew Slimmon, Chicago-based
managing director of global investment solutions at Morgan
Stanley Smith Barney, said in a telephone interview. His firm
has $1.7 trillion in client assets. “There are a lot of
investors with too much cash on the sidelines that are
capitulating and moving into the market.”  Fed’s Tools  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is enlarging his supply of
unconventional tools to attack U.S. unemployment stuck above 8
percent since February 2009, a situation he called a “grave
concern.” Unlike the two previous rounds of quantitative
easing, the program announced yesterday has no end date.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., Alcoa Inc. and
Marathon Oil Corp. rose more than 2 percent to pace a rally in
raw-material and energy shares, which led gains among the 10
main groups in the  S&P 500 . Staples Inc. jumped 2.1 percent amid
a report that private-equity firms are considering buying the
largest U.S. office-supplies chain. Analogic Corp. surged 16
percent after profit topped estimates.  Apple Inc. rose 1.2 percent to a record $691.28, helping
lead the Nasdaq Composite Index to an almost 12-year high. Apple
said orders for the iPhone 5 from its online store won’t ship
for two weeks, fueling speculation the new model has sold out.  Government reports today showed retail sales increased 0.9
percent in August, the most in six months, and the consumer-
 price index  increased 0.6 percent. The rise in the cost of
living was the biggest in more than three years and reflected a
surge in fuel prices.  Consumer Confidence  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan gauge of
 consumer confidence  climbed to 79.2 in September from 74.3 in
August, topping the median  economist  forecast for a reading of
74.  The 10-year Treasury note yield climbed as much as 17 basis
points to a four-month high of 1.89 percent, the rate on
similar-maturity  German bunds  increased 16 basis points to 1.67
percent and 10-year U.K. gilt yields added 15 basis points to
1.96 percent.  The difference  between yields on U.S. government 10-year
notes and same-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities,
an indicator of trader expectations for consumer prices over the
life of the debt, widened to as much as 2.64 percentage points,
the most since April 2011.  Miners Rally  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index jumped 1.3 percent to its
highest level in 15 months. A gauge of mining companies rallied
6.1 percent, the most this year. Rio Tinto Group, the  world’s
third-largest commodity producer , surged 6.6 percent, while  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the biggest, added 6 percent.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) ,
the copper company controlled by Chile’s Luksic family, soared
7.8 percent and Anglo American Plc advanced 9.2 percent.  Chemring Group Plc (CHG)  rallied 5.7 percent as the U.K.’s
Takeover Panel granted  Carlyle Group LP (CG)  an extra month to
consider making a bid for the maker of munitions. In a statement
today, Chemring said that the panel has a new “put up or shut
up” deadline of Oct. 12.  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  jumped 5 percent as the
platinum producer resumed talks with workers in an attempt to
end a five-week strike at its Marikana mine in  South Africa .  The yield on 10-year Italian bonds rose one basis points to
5.02 percent, after earlier dipping below 5 percent for the
first time since March 26.  Dollar Weakens  The dollar depreciated as much as 1.3 percent to $1.3169
per euro, the weakest level since May 4. The South Korean won
appreciated almost 1 percent to 1,117.30 per dollar, after S&P
upgraded the nation’s debt. Singapore’s dollar reached S$1.2203
against its U.S. equivalent today, the strongest level since
September 2011. The pound climbed 0.5 percent to $1.6229, the
highest since April 30.  The yen retreated from a seven-month high against the
dollar after Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  signaled he’s ready to
intervene to weaken the currency.  Oil pared gains after ring above $100 for the first time
since May 4 amid concern that unrest in the  Middle East  and
North Africa will disrupt supplies. West Texas Intermediate
crude for October delivery climbed as much as 2.2 percent to
$100.42 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  and settled today’s session up 0.7 percent
at $99.  Gold Climbs  Spot gold rose 0.2 percent to $1,769.93 an ounce in London
trading, and earlier today touched $1,778, its highest price
since Feb. 29. Zinc, copper, lead, nickel and aluminum jumped
more than 3.8 percent to lead gains in 20 of 24 commodities
tracked by the S&P GSCI.  Platinum rose for an 11th day for its longest streak of
gains in more than a quarter of a century. Workers protested
about their pay at mines owned by the three companies that
account for more than half of global output of the metal.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments fell for a fourth day, declining
12 basis points to 173, the lowest since the current series of
the gauge started trading in March. The index has retreated for
10 straight weeks, its longest-ever streak.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index increased 3.3 percent, the
most since June. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
mainland companies jumped 3.7 percent and India’s Sensex climbed
2.5 percent. Russia’s  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  rose 4.1 percent, extending
