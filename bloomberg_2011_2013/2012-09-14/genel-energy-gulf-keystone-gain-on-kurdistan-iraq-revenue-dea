Genel Energy Plc (GENL)  and  Gulf Keystone
Petroleum Ltd. (GKP)  rose in London trading after  Iraq ’s central
government and the semi-autonomous Kurdish region reached an
agreement to end an oil revenue dispute.  Genel gained 3.7 percent, the most since Aug. 14, to 731
pence. Gulf Keystone rose 6.2 percent to 234.8 pence.  The Kurdish regional government will initially boost oil
production to 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day with
further increases scheduled for next year, according to the
agreement, Rowsch Shawayes, Iraq’s deputy prime minister for
economic affairs, said last yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  Iraqi and Kurdish officials had disagreed over how to share
revenue from oil produced from Kurdish fields after some of the
world’s biggest oil companies, including  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,
 Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  Total SA (FP) , committed to doing business there.  DNO International ASA (DNO) , a Norwegian company operating in
Kurdistan, rose 11.7 percent, the most since March.  Genel, run by former  BP Plc (BP/)  Chief Executive Officer  Tony Hayward , is targeting production of about 200,000 barrels of oil
a day in Kurdistan by the time a new export pipeline is
completed next year. The company said last month it will expand
further outside of Kurdistan, with more exploration acreage, as
well as drill seven wells in Iraq this year and next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
