The power of hurricanes to drive up
oil prices is diminishing as the proportion of U.S. crude coming
from the  Gulf of Mexico  falls to a 14-year low because of the
increase in onshore shale production.  Oil prices were little changed in the week ended Aug. 31
even as more than 90 percent of Gulf capacity was shut for five
consecutive days with Hurricane Isaac hitting the region. Oil
jumped 44 percent in 2008 during Hurricane Ike and 14 percent in
2005 when Katrina devastated the  Gulf Coast . Crude inventories
rose a week after Isaac made landfall in  Louisiana  while Katrina
cut stockpiles for six straight weeks.  U.S. oil  production  reached a 13-year high in July as
growth in output from shale-rock formations, including the
Bakken in  North Dakota , bolstered supplies and sent inventories
to the most since 1990. Production in the federal waters of the
Gulf will account for 21 percent of domestic output this year,
the lowest level since 1998 and down from 29 percent in 2009,
according to Energy Department data.  “The U.S. supply story is shale production,”  Harry Tchilinguirian , BNP Paribas SA’s London-based head of commodity
markets strategy, said in a phone interview yesterday. “It’s
not so much about the Gulf and the impact of hurricanes is just
a temporary shutdown of production that should recover quite
rapidly.”  Crude for October delivery gained 38 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $98.69 a barrel at 12:07 p.m. on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange after climbing to $100.42. Prices rose 0.3 percent in
the week ended Aug. 31.  Hurricane Isaac  Isaac, a Category 1 hurricane, made landfall on Aug. 28,
shutting in as much as 1.31 million barrels a day of production
on Aug. 30, or 95 percent of the region’s capacity, according to
 the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement .  Closures remained above 90 percent, or more than 1.2
million barrels a day, in the five days ended Sept. 1. About 36
percent of Gulf output was still shut on Sept. 7.  “Storms aren’t going to cause as much damage as they used
to,”  Kyle Cooper , director of commodities research at IAF
Advisors in Houston, said in a phone interview. “The Gulf is
still an important part of the U.S. oil market but its
significance has been declining over the past few years.”  There were no storms threatening production in the Gulf of
Mexico this week. Tropical Storm Nadine, the 14th named system
of the Atlantic season, was 765 miles (1,235 kilometers) east-
southeast of  Bermuda  and posed no threat to land, the National
Hurricane Center said today in its latest advisory.  Isaac cut a total of 10.5 million barrels of oil supply
from the Gulf, according to LCI Energy Insight, an energy
analysis firm in El Paso,  Texas .  Lesser Impact  “Obviously the Gulf is producing less oil and storms are
not going to have the immediate price impact that we’ve seen in
the past,” Luke Larson, vice president at LCI, said by phone
yesterday.  Ike  and  Katrina  cut more oil production than Isaac and
caused more damage to offshore platforms.  Oil prices  surged to $130 a barrel on Sept. 22, 2008, from
as low as $90.51 six days earlier after  Ike , a Category 2 storm,
made landfall on Sept. 13 near Galveston, Texas, less than two
weeks after Hurricane Gustav hit the region. Ike cut 21.5
million barrels of oil from Gulf production, according to the
 Energy Department .  Katrina, which went ashore on Aug. 29, 2005 as a Category 3
storm, curtailed 30.2 million barrels of output. Oil prices
jumped to $70.85 a barrel on Aug. 30 from as low as $62.25 on
Aug. 18.  More Resilient  The Gulf is better able to withstand storms as  oil
companies  upgraded their facilities after Katrina. Offshore
production was also in decline as the  moratorium  imposed after
the  BP Plc (BP/)  oil spill slowed the development of deep-water
fields.  “A lot of these platforms have been upgraded after the
events that we’ve seen in 2005 so they are in a better position
to endure adverse weather conditions,” said Tchilinguirian.
“If you would have a bearing on the market you need permanent
shutdowns.”  Gulf output is forecast to fall to 1.3 million barrels a
day this year from 1.56 million in 2009, according to the  Energy
Department . Output in the lower 48 states excluding the Gulf is
forecast to grow to 4.51 million barrels a day, the most since
at least 1993.  “If it had not been for that drilling moratorium, Gulf
production would have been higher,” said  James Williams , an
economist at WTRG Economics, an energy-research firm in  London ,
 Arkansas . “It’s going to take another two or three years to get
Gulf production back to where it was.”  Drilling Ban  The six-month drilling ban in waters deeper than 500 feet
(152 meters), imposed after BP’s Macondo well off Louisiana blew
out April 20, 2010, was lifted in October of that year.  Shale oil has been boosting U.S. domestic production amid
slower drilling in the Gulf. Total  production  increased to 6.36
million barrels a day in the week ended July 20, the most since
February 1999, according to the department. Crude  inventories 
rose to 387.3 million in the week ended June 15, the most since
July 1990.  “A lot of the growth that we’re going to be seeing in the
domestic oil production is going to be coming from onshore
rather than offshore,”  Adam Sieminski , the head of the Energy
Department’s Energy Information Administration, said during a
Bloomberg Government lunch on Aug. 22.  North Dakota  Production in North Dakota jumped to 660,000 barrels a day
in June from 386,000 a year earlier, according to the
 department . Texas, the biggest producing state, increased to 1.9
million barrels a day, up from 1.41 million a year earlier.  “What’s happening in North Dakota is incredible,”  John Felmy , chief economist at the industry-funded  American Petroleum
Institute , said in a phone interview. “There is no question
that the industry is still committed to the Gulf.”  Imports from  Canada  are also reducing reliance on the Gulf.
The country, the biggest oil exporter to the U.S., shipped a
record of 2.52 million barrels a day to its neighbor in
February, according to  Energy Department data .  To contact the reporter on this story:
