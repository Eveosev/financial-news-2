The  University of Texas  evacuated
its flagship Austin campus after receiving a bomb threat.  No bombs had been found at 10:40 a.m. local time, the
 Associated Press  reported.  A man with a middle-eastern accent called the school at
8:35 a.m. local time and said bombs had been placed “all over
campus” and would go off in 90 minutes, the university said in
an e-mailed statement.  “Immediately evacuate ALL buildings and get as far away as
possible,” said a notice on the university’s website.  There were no reports of explosions at 10:30 a.m. local
time. University police couldn’t immediately be reached for
comment.  The evacuation was ordered “out of an abundance of
caution,” Rhonda Weldon, a spokeswoman for the university, said
in the statement.  UT has about 50,000 students at its campus north of
downtown Austin.  North Dakota State University in Fargo, an institution of
14,000, also received a bomb threat and evacuated its campus, AP
reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
