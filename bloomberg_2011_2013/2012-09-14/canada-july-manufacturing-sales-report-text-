The following is the text of
 Canada â€™s manufacturing shipments report for July released
by  Statistics Canada .  Manufacturing sales fell 1.5% to $48.3 billion in July, the
third decrease in five months. Declines in transportation
equipment were largely responsible for the overall drop.
Manufacturers in 11 of 21 industries reported lower sales,
representing over 60% of total manufacturing.  Constant dollar sales decreased 2.0%. Sales of durable
goods fell 2.7% while sales of non-durable goods edged down 0.1%.  Transportation equipment loses traction after strong advances  Sales of transportation equipment fell 6.4% to $8.6 billion
in July. The decrease follows four consecutive months of
increases. A 22.1% drop in aerospace product and parts led the
decline, followed by a 3.2% decrease in  motor vehicle  assembly.  Despite the decline in transportation equipment in July,
manufacturers in this industry reported strong advances in the
first half of 2012. Sales rose 17.8% compared with the first
half of 2011. Higher sales in the motor vehicle assembly
(+22.4%) and motor vehicle parts (+23.3%) industries drove the
increase. In the first half of 2012, motor vehicle assembly was
at its highest level since 2007, the year before the industry
experienced a sharp downturn.  Lower sales of machinery equipment (-2.4%) also played a
part in the overall drop. After reporting gains in June,
manufacturers in the commercial and service machinery
manufacturing industry reported lower sales in July.  Largest declines in Ontario and Quebec  Manufacturing sales declined in five provinces in July.
Ontario and  Quebec  posted the largest decreases in dollar terms.  In Ontario, sales were down 1.9% to $22.3 billion. The
decrease partly reflects a 3.0% decline in the motor vehicle
assembly industry to $4.4 billion. Lower sales in the machinery
(-6.6%), primary metals (-3.9%) and petroleum and coal product
(-4.4%) industries also contributed to the provincial decline.  Manufacturing sales in Quebec decreased 2.6% to $11.3
billion, largely stemming from lower production in the aerospace
product and parts industry. Aerospace production was down 45.1%
to $569 million. Higher sales in the fabricated metal product
industry partly offset the decline.  In  Nova Scotia , sales were down 12.6% to $772 million,
reflecting lower sales in the non-durable goods industries.  The largest provincial rise was posted by  New Brunswick ,
where sales advanced 6.8% to $1.6 billion. The gain was mostly
attributable to higher sales of non-durable goods.  Inventories rise  Inventories rose 1.0% in July to $65.5 billion, led by
increases in the aerospace product and parts, and machinery
industries. The aerospace product and parts industry posted a
7.4% increase to $4.9 billion, while inventories of machinery
were up 2.8% to $6.9 billion.  Inventories in the computer and electronic product (+2.7%),
motor vehicle (+7.1%), and wood product (+2.6%) industries also
posted gains.  Decreases in inventories in the petroleum and coal products
(-5.3%) and primary metal (-2.0%) industries partly offset the
overall gain.  The inventory-to-sales ratio increased from 1.32 in June to
1.36 in July. The inventory-to-sales ratio is a measure of the
time, in months, that would be required to exhaust inventories
if sales were to remain at their current level.  Unfilled orders decline  Unfilled orders decreased 1.2% to $63.4 billion in July,
following two months of gains. The decrease reflected lower
unfilled orders in the aerospace product and parts, machinery,
and fabricated metal product industries.  In the  aerospace industry , unfilled orders declined 0.7% to
$32.6 billion. The decline stemmed from an increase in the value
of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar in July. A
large portion of unfilled orders in this industry are in US
dollars.  Unfilled orders in the machinery industry were down 2.3% to
$8.1 billion, while those in the fabricated metal product
industry fell 1.9% to $6.6 billion. In both industries, many
manufacturers reported lower unfilled orders.  New orders fell 5.6% in July to $47.5 billion, mainly
reflecting a drop in orders in the aerospace product and parts
industry.  Note to readers  The 2011 manufacturing review was released on August 3,
2012. The annual report Manufacturing: The Year 2011 in Review
( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc-cel?catno=11-621 -
M2012090&amp;lang=fra) examines recent trends for sales by
industry and other relevant variables related to manufacturing.  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and are
expressed in current dollars unless otherwise specified. For
more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment
and identifying economic trends
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010-x/2010003/part-partie3 -
eng.htm).  Preliminary data are provided for the current reference
month. Revised data, based on late responses, are updated for
the three previous months.  Non-durable goods industries include food, beverage and
tobacco products, textile mills, textile product mills, clothing,
leather and allied products, paper, printing and related support
activities, petroleum and coal products, chemicals, and plastics
and rubber products.  Durable goods industries include wood products, non-
metallic mineral products, primary metal, fabricated metal
products, machinery, computer and electronic products,
electrical equipment, appliances and components, transportation
equipment, furniture and related products and miscellaneous
manufacturing.  Production-based industries  For the aerospace industry and shipbuilding industries, the
value of production is used instead of sales of goods
manufactured. This value is calculated by adjusting monthly
sales of goods manufactured by the monthly change in inventories
of goods in process and finished products manufactured.  Unfilled orders are a stock of orders that will contribute
to future sales assuming that the orders are not cancelled.  New orders are those received whether sold in the current
month or not. New orders are measured as the sum of sales for
the current month plus the change in unfilled orders from the
previous month to the current month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
