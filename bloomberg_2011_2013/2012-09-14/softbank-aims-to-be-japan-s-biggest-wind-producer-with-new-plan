Softbank Corp. (9984) , Japan’s third-
biggest mobile phone company, plans to build a wind farm in the
nation’s north that could make it the country’s largest producer
of wind power.  Softbank has plans for a 500-turbine facility that would
produce as much as 1 gigawatt of power at a site on the island
of Hokkaido, Kenichi Yuasa, a spokesman for the Tokyo-based
company, said today in an e-mail.  The company is discussing the plan with local officials and
measuring how much output is needed by the surrounding
population, Yuasa said.  Eurus Energy Holdings Corp., controlled by Nagoya-based
 Toyota Tsusho Corp (8015) , is currently Japan’s biggest wind producer
with 698 megawatts of wind and solar power capacity in  Japan  and
other Asian countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
