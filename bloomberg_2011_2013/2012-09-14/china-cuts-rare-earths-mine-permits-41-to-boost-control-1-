China  reduced the number of permits
to mine rare earths by 41 percent, tightening production of the
metallic elements used in batteries and magnets.  China issued 67 mining licenses for rare earths and 10
exploration permits, the Ministry of Land and Resources said
yesterday in a statement. The nation previously had 113 mining
licenses, said Wei Chishan, a Shanghai-based analyst at SMM
Information & Technology Co.  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. (600111) , China’s
biggest producer, led gains today by producers in Shanghai
trading. Chinese output accounts for more than 90 percent of the
global supply of rare earths such as neodymium, used in magnets,
and lanthanum, which refiners use to help separate crude oil
into gasoline and other products.  “The goal appears to be to gain greater control over the
production of rare earths by putting that production largely
into the hands of companies that are large enough to not have
any real incentive to cheat on their production or export
quotas,”  Jonathan Hykawy , a Toronto-based analyst at Byron
Capital Markets Ltd., said in an e-mail.  Inner Mongolia  Baotou Steel gained 2.2 percent to close at
35.49 yuan today in Shanghai.  Rising Nonferrous Metals Share Co. (600259) 
gained 2.1 percent to 51.37 yuan and China Nonferrous Metal
Industry’s Foreign Engineering and Construction Co. was up 1.7
percent to 21.81 yuan in Shenzhen. The benchmark Shanghai
Composite Index advanced 0.6 percent.  China’s eastern province of Jiangxi, which focuses on the
production of so-called mid-to-heavy rare earths, had the most
number of mining licenses withdrawn, Cai Hongyu, a Hong Kong-
based analyst with China International Capital Corp., said today
in an e-mailed note. The cut would benefit rivals including
 Xiamen Tungsten Co. (600549)  and Rising Nonferrous, she said.  Price Surge  Rare-earth prices surged in 2011 after the Chinese
government said it would restrict exports. Since then prices
have dropped as users work through stockpiles, Byron Capital’s
Hykawy said.  Neodymium oxide  produced in Inner Mongolia has
dropped 63 percent in the past 12 months to 425,000 yuan
($67,130) a metric ton, according to data from Shanghai
Steelhome Information.  Lanthanum oxide  fell 55 percent to 62,500
yuan.  Molycorp Inc. (MCP) , the  Greenwood Village , Colorado-based
company developing the largest deposit of rare earths outside of
China, rose 5.2 percent to close at $12.71 yesterday in New York.  China said in July 2010 that it would cut rare-earth export
quotas to allow it to close polluting and inefficient mines
while continuing to meet domestic needs.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
