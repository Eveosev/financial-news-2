U.K. stocks  advanced to their
highest level in nearly six months, after the  Federal Reserve 
announced an open-ended bond-buying program to boost the world’s
biggest economy.  Mining stocks rallied as copper prices rose, with  Rio Tinto
Group (RIO)  and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BLT)  climbing at least 6 percent.  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  led banking shares higher. JD
Wetherspoon Plc gained 3.3 percent after posting full-year
earnings that beat estimates.  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  rose 95.63 points, or 1.6 percent, to 5,915.55
at the close in London, the highest level since March 19. The
gauge has gained 2.1 percent this week and 12 percent since its
2012 low on June 1 as European Central Bank policy makers agreed
on an unlimited bond-buying program and optimism mounted the Fed
would announce a third round of quantitative easing. The broader
FTSE All-Share Index added 1.7 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index climbed 1.2 percent.  “Short of throwing money out of a helicopter, there is
little more that  Ben Bernanke  could have done to enthuse markets
this much,” said Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG Index
in London. “Mr Bernanke has lashed himself to the mast of
economic stability, throwing the weight of the world’s most
powerful central bank behind the US economy. Combine that with
signs of progress in the euro zone, and we now have the
potential for markets to push yet higher.”  Fed Policy  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday said the central
bank will buy $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities a month,
without setting a limit on the ultimate amount it would buy or
the duration of the program. The Fed also extended its near-zero
interest rate policy until 2015 and said it will stay
accommodative “for a considerable time” even after the economy
strengthens.  The volume of shares changing hands on the FTSE 100 was 84
percent more than the average of the last 30 days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  An  index  of London-listed mining stocks jumped 7.2 percent,
the most since October 2011, as copper rose and Australia’s
Treasurer said the country’s resource boom will continue.
Investments in mining and energy projects “still have some way
to run,”  Wayne Swan  told the Australia in China’s Century
conference in Sydney today, according to a text of his speech.  Rio, BHP  Rio Tinto surged 6.6 percent to 3,281.5 pence and BHP
gained 6 percent to 2,049 pence.  Australia’s highest court today struck down previous orders
by a tribunal that had ruled that BHP and Rio should share
access to their railroads with Fortescue Metals Group Ltd.,
returning the dispute to the Australian Competition Tribunal.  Anglo American Plc jumped 9.2 percent to 2,084 pence and
Xstrata Plc climbed 6.8 percent to 1,060.5 pence.  Antofagasta
Plc (ANTO)  rallied 7.8 percent to 1,334 pence, the most since November.  A  gauge of British banking shares  listed on the FTSE 350
Index gained 3.3 percent to the highest level since March.  HSBC added 2.9 percent to 584.4 pence, while Barclays
advanced 5.1 percent to 229.05 pence.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) 
rose 3.8 percent to 1,506.5 pence.  Wetherspoon (JDW)  rose 3.3 percent to 475.7 pence after the U.K.
pub owner said full-year pretax profit before exceptional items
was 72.4 million pounds ($117.2 million), exceeding the average
analyst estimate of 69.2 million pounds in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Pace Plc (PIC)  slid 9.7 percent to 162.5 pence after the
Financial Times reported that set-top boxes supplied by the
company didn’t meet BT Group Plc’s requirements. BT had planned
to use them for its Internet television service YouView.  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  lost 1.5 percent to 1,417.5 pence and
Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc slid 1.7 percent to 3,572 pence. A
gauge of healthcare stocks was the worst-performing of the 19
industry groups on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
