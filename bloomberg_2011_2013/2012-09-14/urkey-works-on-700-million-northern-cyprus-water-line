Turkey is working on a $700 million
project for a dam and 107-kilometer (66-mile) pipeline under the
 Mediterranean Sea  to supply fresh water to northern Cyprus,
Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay said today.  Construction of the pipeline that will run from Alakopru
dam near Anamur on the Mediterranean to a dam that will be built
in Gecitkoy in northern Cyprus is expected to start next year
and be operational by March 2014. When done, the pipeline could
also supply water to the southern Greek Cypriot side should the
island be unified, Atalay said.  The line is designed to carry 75 million cubic meters (19.8
billion gallons) of water a year to northern Cyprus. Cyprus has
been divided between the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish-held
northern part since  Turkey  invaded in 1974 in response to a
Greek Cypriot coup to unite the island with  Greece .  To contact the reporter on this story:
