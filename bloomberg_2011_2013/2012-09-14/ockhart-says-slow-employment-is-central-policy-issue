President  Dennis Lockhart  said sluggish growth in the job market
has become a central issue for policy makers.  “As you know the Federal Open Market Committee statement
yesterday noted slow employment growth and expressed concerns
that without further stimulus we might not have enough growth
generated to sustain improvement in labor  markets,” Lockhart
said at a conference on the labor market at the Atlanta Fed.  “I am not going to expound further on the FOMC statement
or the chairman’s remarks in his press conference,” he said.
“But it is clear the labor market and the outlook for jobs is
really front and center in current policy debates” and
“remains a very difficult and complex problem.”  Lockhart supported the Federal Open Market Committee
decision yesterday to expand its holdings of long-term
securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of mortgage
debt a month in a third round of quantitative easing. The Fed is
seeking to boost growth and reduce 8.1 percent unemployment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
