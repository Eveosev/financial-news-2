Pentair Inc. (PNR)  shareholders approved
the merger of the water filtration company and the flow control
business of  Tyco International Ltd. (TYC)  today at a special meeting.  Completion of the merger announced in March that valued the
flow unit at about $4.9 billion including debt and minority
interest remains subject to the approval of the spinoff by Tyco
shareholders and customary closing conditions, Pentair said in a
statement from Minneapolis.  The merger will create one of the few companies that offer
valves, pumps and filtration to tap sales in developing nations
where a middle class of 4 billion help drive demand, Pentair
Chief Executive Officer Randall Hogan, who will lead
the combined company, said on a March call with investors.   The new company will be the world’s largest flow,
filtration and equipment-protection company, Hogan said then. It
will retain Tyco’s incorporation in  Switzerland  to help with tax
savings and its main offices will be at Pentair’s headquarters
in Minneapolis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
