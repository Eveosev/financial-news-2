Venezuela could default on its debt
as early as the second half of 2013 if President  Hugo Chavez 
wins re-election next month and fails to shore up the oil-
producing nation’s “increasingly fragile” balance sheet,
Morgan Stanley said.  One “tipping point” could be the $4.3 billion in external
debt payments that come due between August and November 2013,
Morgan Stanley analyst  Daniel Volberg  wrote in a note to clients
today.  Chavez, who is seeking to extend almost 14 years in power
with another six-year term, has damaged Venezuela’s balance
sheet through the nationalization of key sectors of the economy,
endemic inflation and a lack of fiscal discipline, Volberg said.
The policies are an “unsustainable” mix that heighten the risk
of default on Venezuela’s $110.6 billion stock of debt,
especially if  oil prices  tumble, Volberg wrote.  Government actions “may be taking Venezuela towards a
crisis and potentially even a debt event that could come as
early as the second half of 2013,” the report said.
“Venezuela’s debt is no longer with large bank lenders as much
as publicly traded bonds held by a dispersed group of creditors,
which could make restructuring more challenging.”  At 11.6 percent of gross domestic product, Venezuela has
the largest fiscal deficit in  Latin America , while its
international reserves have fallen by $17 billion since 2008 to
$25.6 billion, Volberg said. Output by state oil company
Petroleos de Venezuela SA fell to 2.72 million barrels a day in
2011 from 3.48 million barrels in 1998, according to British
Petroleum’s statistical review.  Bond Yields  The yield on  Venezuela ’s benchmark 9.25 percent bonds due
in 2027 fell 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 10.77
percent at 11:27 a.m. in Caracas, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose 0.74 cent today to 88.80 cents
on the dollar.  The cost of insuring Venezuelan bonds against default for
five years rose four basis points to 737 basis points, according
to prices compiled by Bloomberg. Credit-default swaps pay the
buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or
the cash equivalent should a government or company fail to
comply with debt agreements.  Chavez said Sept. 11 that he had 43.1 percent support
against 30 percent for opposition candidate Henrique Capriles
Radonski in the latest poll conducted by Datanalisis. He didn’t
give details of the survey.  The two previous Datanalisis polls showed Chavez with a
lead of 12.1 and 14.3 percentage points respectively, he said.
In an August Consultores 21 poll of 1,000 people, Chavez trailed
Capriles by 47.7 percent to 45.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
