Swiss stocks  advanced to a 16-month
high after the  Federal Reserve  started a third round of
quantitative easing that will release $40 billion a month into
the world’s largest economy.  Adecco (ADEN)  SA, the biggest supplier of temporary workers,
jumped 4.2 percent.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
Switzerland’s biggest lenders, gained at least 2.5 percent. Cie.
Financiere Richemont SA and  Swatch Group AG (UHR)  climbed more than 3
percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  rose 0.7 percent to 6,559.16 at the
close in Zurich, the highest since May 16, 2011. The gauge
gained for a second week after Germany’s highest constitutional
court approved the euro area’s permanent bailout fund. The SMI
has  rallied 15 percent  from this year’s low on June 4. The
broader Swiss Performance Index added 0.9 percent today.  “The Fed’s new measure was a positive surprise to
investors in terms of its size and expected targets,” said
Michael Borre, a chief equity adviser at Nordea Private Bank in
Copenhagen. “Unless something unforeseen happens, we expect the
the future to be less troublesome.”  The Fed said it will increase its holdings of long-term
securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of mortgage
debt a month. The central bank will continue to buy mortgage-
backed securities until the outlook for the labor market
substantially improves, the  Federal Open Market Committee  said
yesterday in a statement at the end of its two-day meeting in
Washington.  Growth Outlook  The FOMC also said it will probably hold the federal funds
rate near zero until at least the middle of 2015. The Fed had
said  the rate  would stay low through late 2014. Fed officials
said economic growth will improve faster than they had
projected, as they upgraded their estimates for 2013 and 2014.  Euro-area finance ministers and central-bank officials will
hold a two-day meeting starting today in Cyprus to discuss plans
for a banking union in the 17-nation currency zone.  Adecco jumped 4.2 percent to 48.68 Swiss francs for the
second+biggest gain on the SMI.  UBS and Credit Suisse rose 4.1 percent to 12.52 francs and
2.7 percent to 21.51 francs, respectively, as a gauge of
European banks rallied to the highest since March 27.  Julius
Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  gained 2.1 percent to 34.18 Swiss francs, rising
for an eight day.  Cie. Richemont, the maker of Montblanc pens and Cartier
jewelry, increased 4.4 percent to 62.55 francs. Swatch Group
advanced 3.1 percent to 409.40 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
