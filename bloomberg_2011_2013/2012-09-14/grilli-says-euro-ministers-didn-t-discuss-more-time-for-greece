Italian Finance Minister  Vittorio Grilli  said he and his counterparts in the 17-nation euro area
didn’t discuss giving Greece more time to meet its bailout
obligations.  “We didn’t talk about more time for Greece because this
wasn’t on the agenda,” Grilli said today on the sidelines of a
meeting of finance ministers in Nicosia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
