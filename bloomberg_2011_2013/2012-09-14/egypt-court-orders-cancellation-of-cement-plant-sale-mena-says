An Egyptian court ordered today
that the sale of a cement factory to private-sector interests
should be canceled and that the plant should be returned to the
government, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported.  The court ruled that all workers forced to retire after the
sale can return, the agency said.  A lawsuit was filed after the factory was sold to Mexican
businessmen in 1999 for less than its true value and thousands
of workers were forced into early retirement, MENA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
