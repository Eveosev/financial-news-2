Global equity funds lured the
largest weekly inflows this year amid speculation the U.S.
 Federal Reserve  will introduce a third round of asset purchases
known as quantitative easing, according to Citigroup Inc.  Equity funds attracted $12.1 billion in the week ended
Sept. 12, Markus Rosgen and Yue-Hin Pong, analysts at the
brokerage, wrote in a report today. Global emerging-equity funds
lured $390 million, according to the report, which cited data
compiled by EPFR Global.  The inflows preceded the Fed’s announcement yesterday that
it will expand holdings of long-term securities with open-ended
purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt a month as it seeks to
boost growth and reduce unemployment. European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said on Sept. 6 policy makers agreed to
an unlimited bond-purchase program as they try to regain control
of  interest rates  in the euro area.  “When there’s more liquidity in the market and there’s
bond purchases by the ECB recently, we expect some flows from
bonds into equities,” Citigroup’s Pong said by phone from  Hong
Kong  today. “Given that Asian shares are relatively cheap in
the global market, we expect more inflows here.”  Asian-focused funds attracted $100 million in the week to
Sept. 12, while China funds lured $239 million and Hong Kong
drew $89 million, according to the Citigroup report.  The MSCI All-Country World Index gained 0.6 percent to
336.68 as of 10:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, poised for the highest
close since March 19. The  gauge  is valued at 13.1 times
estimated profit, compared with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s
12.8 times. The Asia Pacific measure rose 1.9 percent today.  Worst Recession  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has deployed the most
aggressive monetary policies since the central bank’s founding
nearly a century ago as he battled the 2007-2009 financial
crisis, helped pull the U.S. out of the worst recession since
the 1930s and then sought to keep the expansion going.  The Fed lowered its target  interest rate  to zero in
December 2008 and undertook two rounds of large-scale asset
purchases that swelled its balance sheet to almost $3 trillion
from less than $900 billion in December 2007, when the recession
began.  Unlike the first and second rounds of quantitative easing,
yesterday’s program has no end date. Bernanke declined to
provide specific estimates of what economic conditions would
prompt the Fed to act or how long the purchases might last.  The MSCI All-Country World gained 3.7 percent in the month
after Fed announced its first quantitative easing program on
Nov. 25, 2008. The gauge advanced 0.8 percent in the month after
the declaration of the second plan on Nov. 3, 2010.  -- Editors: Darren Boey, Allen Wan  To contact the reporter on this story:
