U.S. authorities are examining
whether a California man associated with the online  movie clip 
that sparked protests across the  Middle East  violated the terms
of his parole.  The U.S. Probation Office in  Los Angeles  is looking into
Nakoula Basseley Nakoula’s role in the film “Innocence of the
Muslims,” according to Karen Redmond, a spokeswoman for the
administrative office of the U.S. courts.  Nakoula, 55, has a criminal history that includes bank
fraud by using false identities and a drug conviction. Under the
terms of his release, he is prohibited from representing himself
with anything other than his true legal name, and is barred from
using the Internet without permission from his probation
officer.  The 14-minute  trailer , posted on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube,
shows a fictional attack by Muslims on a Christian family,
followed by an account of the origins of Islam depicting
Muhammad as a womanizer. YouTube blocked access to the clip in
 Egypt  and  Libya  following attacks on the U.S. missions in those
countries. The company said yesterday it would restrict access
in  India  and  Indonesia  to comply with local laws. It isn’t clear
whether a full-length movie exists.  Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in
Los Angeles, said he couldn’t confirm Nakoula is the same person
who identified himself as the director, Sam Bacile, in
interviews this week.  A four-hour assault on the U.S. diplomatic mission in
Benghazi on Sept. 11 killed Christopher Stevens, the U.S.
ambassador to Libya, and three embassy employees. In Egypt and
 Iran , demonstrators rallied against the film. Protesters
targeted U.S. embassies in Yemen, Tunisia and  Sudan .  Mystery Film  Details of the movie’s origins remain a mystery. A man
calling himself Sam Bacile gave interviews this week to the
 Associated Press  and the Wall Street Journal claiming he was the
filmmaker. He said he was an Israeli-American real estate
developer.  Following press reports that the name was a pseudonym, the
AP traced the mobile-phone number it had for Bacile to Nakoula,
a Coptic Christian living in suburban Los Angeles. In an
interview, Nakoula told the  news agency  he managed logistics for
the company that made the movie. He said he wasn’t the director,
according to the AP.  Tim Dax, an actor in the film, told the  Los Angeles Times 
that he was paid $75 a day in checks drawn from a bank account
of Abanob Basseley Nakoula, a name linked to Nakoula’s address
in public records. Dax, reached through his Facebook profile,
declined to comment further.  Fraud, Meth  Nakoula was sentenced to one year in jail in 1997 for
intent to manufacture methamphetamine, according to Jane
Robison, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles County District Attorney
Steve Cooley. He was given another year for violating probation
in 2002.  Nakoula pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and was
sentenced to 21 months in prison and ordered to pay $794,700 in
restitution, according to the June 24, 2010, sentencing document
by U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder in Los Angeles.  Accused of fraudulently opening bank and credit-card
accounts with a combination of real and fictitious information,
he spent time in federal prison before being released from a
halfway house in December 2010, according to the  federal Bureau 
of Prisons. He had been in detention from the time of his arrest
in June 2009.  Web Restrictions  During a five-year probation period, Nakoula is only
allowed to use identification with his true legal name; can’t
have a device with online access without prior approval; can
only use computers, screen or user names, passwords and e-mail
accounts that have been approved by his probation officer; and
can only use approved computers for his work, according to court
records.  James Henderson, the lawyer who represented Nakoula in the
federal case, didn’t return a call for comment. Attempts by
Bloomberg News to reach Nakoula directly were unsuccessful.  “Innocence of Muslims” was shot in August 2011 at Blue
Cloud Movie Ranch in Santa Clarita, north of Los Angeles,
according to Paul Audley, president of Film LA, which assists
movie makers. Permits to make the movie, then called “Desert
Warrior,” were taken out by a group called Media for Christ,
based in the Los Angeles suburb of Duarte, Audley said. A man
named Sam Bossil was identified at the producer.  Actors Duped  The film permit was removed from a Los Angeles County
online database temporarily due to public-safety concerns raised
by the U.S. State Department and the  Federal Bureau of
Investigation , Ryan J. Alsop, assistant to county Chief
Executive Officer William T. Fujioka, said in a statement.  Actors were duped into making a movie that attacked Islam
and inflammatory dialogue was dubbed in later, the Los Angeles
Times reported.  “The entire cast and crew are extremely upset and feel
taken advantage of by the producer,” the Times reported, citing
a statement issued on behalf of the crew members. “We are 100
percent not behind this film and were grossly misled about its
intent and purpose.”  Calls to the Media for Christ office weren’t returned.  Bacile was a pseudonym, according to Steve Klein, a
Southern California insurance salesman and anti-Islamic activist
who said he advised the filmmaker on finding actors.  “This
guy’s terrified,” Klein said in a telephone interview from his
office in Hemet this week. “He’s gone underground.”  Klein’s involvement with the picture couldn’t be
independently verified by  Bloomberg News .  Concerned Citizens  Klein, 62, heads the group Concerned Citizens for the First
Amendment, which stages rallies and educational events,
contending Islam is a threat to U.S. democracy and freedom.  He said he read the script before the movie was shot and
advised the filmmaker to recruit actors through a Hollywood
talent agency. Klein said he didn’t know the name of the agency.  The movie had one theatrical showing at a cinema on Sunset
Boulevard in Hollywood, Klein said.  “I got there about a half hour before the movie started
and stayed a half hour after it started and I saw zero -- nada,
none, no people -- go inside,” Klein said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
