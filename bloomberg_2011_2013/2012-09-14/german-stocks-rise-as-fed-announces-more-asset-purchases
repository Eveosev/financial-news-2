German stocks  rose to a 14-month
high as the  Federal Reserve  said it will buy mortgage-backed
securities to boost growth in the world’s largest economy.  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s two biggest
lenders, added at least 3 percent as a gauge of banks
contributed the most to the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index’s advance.
 ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  climbed 6.4 percent after the stock was upgraded
by Baader Bank AG.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  added 1.4 percent to 7,412.13 at the close of
trading in  Frankfurt , its highest level since July 2011. The
gauge advanced 2.7 percent this week and has risen 24 percent
from this year’s low on June 5 as European Central Bank policy
makers agreed on a bond-buying program, optimism mounted the Fed
would announce further stimulus and  Germany ’s highest
constitutional court approved the euro area’s permanent bailout
fund. The broader HDAX Index gained 1.5 percent today.  “The big lift came as U.S. and Asian markets reacted very
positively,” said Markus Huber, head of German sales trading at
ETX Capital in  London . “The Fed hasn’t put a final figure or
date for asset purchases. If the Fed had done this, there would
have been some profit taking. The central banks are letting
investors know that they will do anything it takes, providing
liquidity and putting inflation concerns on the back burner.”  The volume of shares changing hands on the DAX was 71
percent higher than the average of the last 30 days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Fed said it will increase its holdings of long-term
securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of mortgage
debt a month. The central bank will continue to buy mortgage-
backed securities until the outlook for the labor market
substantially improves, the  Federal Open Market Committee  said
yesterday in a statement at the end of its two-day meeting in
 Washington .  Funds Rate  The FOMC also said it will probably hold the federal funds
rate near zero until at least the middle of 2015. The Fed had
said  the rate  would stay low through late 2014. Fed officials
said economic growth will improve faster than they had
projected, as they upgraded their estimates for gross domestic
product growth in 2013 and 2014.  Euro-area finance ministers and central-bank officials will
hold a two-day meeting starting today in Cyprus to discuss plans
for a banking union in the 17-nation currency zone.  Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank jumped 3.1 percent to 1.60
euros, and 5.2 percent to 33.90 euros, respectively. A gauge of
banking stocks was the biggest riser of the 19 industry groups
on the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index. (SXXP)   ThyssenKrupp, Germany’s biggest steelmaker, climbed 6.4
percent to 18.49 euros as Baader Bank recommended buying the
shares and set a price forecast of 20 euros.  Carmakers Advance  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  surged 4.9 percent to 152.50 euros, its
highest price in almost 20 years. Europe’s largest carmaker said
sales in August rose 19 percent to 719,500 vehicles.  Daimler AG (DAI) , the third-biggest maker of  luxury vehicles ,
added 3 percent to 40.12 euros.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
largest manufacturer of luxury cars, advanced 3.4 percent to 62
euros.  Lanxess AG (LXS)  rose 3.5 percent to 67.51 euros, its highest
price since at least 2005.  Kloeckner & Co. SE, Europe’s largest independent steel
trader, surged 7.6 percent to 8.79 euros after Baader Bank
advised buying the shares.  Software AG (SOW)  gained 1.8 percent to 29.73 euros. The
infrastructure software provider expects to grow, with the U.S.
remaining its biggest market, Chief Executive Officer Karl-Heinz Streibich told Handelsblatt in an interview.  Merck KGaA, the maker of the Erbitux cancer drug, dropped
1.6 percent to 94.02 euros. A gauge of health-care stocks was
the worst performer of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
