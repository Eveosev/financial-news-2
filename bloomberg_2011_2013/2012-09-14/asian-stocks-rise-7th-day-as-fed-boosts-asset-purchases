Asian  stocks  rose a seventh day,
sending the benchmark index to its longest winning streak since
January 2011, after the  Federal Reserve  said it will buy
mortgage-backed securities to bolster economic growth.  Techtronic Industries Co., a power tools maker that gets 72
percent of its sales in  North America , gained 8.2 percent in
 Hong Kong . Zhaojin Mining Industry Co. surged 16 percent in Hong
Kong after  gold prices  climbed to a six-month high. Daewoo

percent in Seoul.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 2.3 percent to 123.79 as
of 5:16 p.m. in  Tokyo , set for its highest close since May 4.
More than five stocks climbed for each that fell on the measure,
which gained 3.9 percent this week, the biggest increase since
December. Nine of the gauge’s 10 industry groups advanced.  “The Fed’s statement made clear that this monetary easing
will go on until employment growth is satisfactory,” said  Akio Yoshino , chief economist in Tokyo at Amundi Japan Ltd., whose
global parent has $897 billion of assets under management.
“This time around we have a clear link between the economy and
monetary policy, and that’s a very big thing. It should give
powerful support for markets.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 3.2 percent this quarter
through yesterday as stimulus measures from  Europe  to  China 
countered concerns about the euro-zone’s debt crisis and a
global economic slowdown. The Asian benchmark traded at 12.8
times estimated earnings, compared with 14.1 for the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 12 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Nikkei, Kospi  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.8 percent.

1.3 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.5
percent today. The index jumped 1.6 percent in New York
yesterday to the highest close since Dec. 31, 2007, after the
Fed said it will conduct open-ended purchases of $40 billion of
mortgage debt a month.  The central bank will continue its purchases of mortgage-
backed securities and undertake other asset purchases if the
outlook for the labor market doesn’t improve substantially, the
 Federal Open Market Committee  said yesterday. It also said it
would probably hold the federal funds rate near zero “at least
through mid-2015.”  ‘Confirmed Speculation’  “The Fed isn’t going to hold any punches back in trying to
combat a slowdown,” said Prasad Patkar, a portfolio manager who
helps manage about $1 billion at Platypus Asset Management Ltd.
in Sydney. “Risk appetite will improve in the short term not
only because of what the Fed’s done, but also globally there
seems to be enough motivation among policy makers in China and
Europe to stimulate.”  Exporters to the U.S. advanced. Techtronic climbed 8.2
percent to HK$13.72 in Hong Kong.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a Japanese
construction machinery maker that gets 23 percent of its sales

percent to HK$111.80 after its full-year underlying profit beat
