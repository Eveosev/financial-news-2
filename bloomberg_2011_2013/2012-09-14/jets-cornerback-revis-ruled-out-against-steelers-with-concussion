New York Jets cornerback  Darrelle Revis  won’t play tomorrow against the Pittsburgh Steelers as he
recovers from a concussion suffered in the team’s opening game.  Revis, 27, participated yesterday in non-contact drills,
but was not cleared to resume full activity, coach  Rex Ryan  said
in a news conference. Tight end Dustin Keller and linebacker
Bryan Thomas also will not play tomorrow at Pittsburgh, Ryan
said.  A Pro Bowl selection in each of the past four National
Football League seasons, Revis suffered the injury in the fourth
quarter of the team’s 48-28 victory against the Buffalo Bills
last weekend when he was kicked in the head by teammate  Bart
Scott  as he tackled running back C.J. Spiller.  He told reporters the concussion initially felt like
“being in a fog.”  “The play happened so fast,” he said. “It just felt like
a headache. At the time, the only thing I could remember was
Spiller running through the hole and I tried to stick my hand
out to make a tackle. But it just happened so fast, it felt like
a headache.”  The Jets (1-0) last played the Steelers (0-1) in the AFC
title game following the 2010 season, losing 24-19.  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
