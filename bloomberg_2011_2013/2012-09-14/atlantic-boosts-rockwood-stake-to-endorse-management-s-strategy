Atlantic Investment Management
Inc., a New York-based hedge fund, increased its stake in
 Rockwood Holdings Inc. (ROC)  because it said it supports management’s
plans to transform the business.  Atlantic owns 3.92 million shares, or 5.05 percent, of
Rockwood, according to a regulatory filing today. That’s up from
a 3.8 percent stake that Princeton, New Jersey-based Rockwood
reported on June 30, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Rockwood, the world’s largest producer of lithium products,
agreed on Aug. 23 to acquire Talison Lithium Ltd. for C$724
million ($746 million) to gain new supplies of the metal used in
rechargeable batteries. The company also is considering a sale
or initial public offering for its Sachtleben unit, which makes
titanium dioxide, a white pigment known by its chemical formula
TiO2.  “We are supportive of management in buying Talison and
spinning off or IPOing TiO2,” Stephen Fisch, an analyst at
Atlantic, said today in a telephone interview.  Atlantic is a “constructive” shareholder that continues
to talk with Rockwood’s managers, he said. The filing was
triggered by the increased stake, and there are no plans to wage
a proxy fight, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
