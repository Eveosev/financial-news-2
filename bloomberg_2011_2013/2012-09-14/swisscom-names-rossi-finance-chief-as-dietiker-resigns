Swisscom AG (SCMN) , Switzerland’s biggest
phone company, named Mario Rossi chief financial officer to
replace Ueli Dietiker, who is stepping down from that role.  Rossi has been head of business steering at Swisscom’s
domestic business since 2010 and held various positions at the
finance department since joining the company in 1998, according
to a statement form the Bern-based carrier today.  The appointment is part of an overhaul of management
positions. Dietiker, who asked to give up the CFO role, will
head Swisscom’s Group Related Businesses, the company said.  Swisscom yesterday said its Fastweb unit in  Italy  will
invest 400 million euros ($521 million) by 2016 in
infrastructure to supply faster broadband services to about 20
percent of homes in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
