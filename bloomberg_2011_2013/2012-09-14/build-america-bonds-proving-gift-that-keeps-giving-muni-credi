Build America Bonds, orphaned after
Congress failed to extend the program in 2010, are on a pace to
beat Treasuries and tax-exempt municipal debt for a third
straight year.  Created by President  Barack Obama ’s 2009 economic stimulus,
the taxable local-government bonds have earned 8.3 percent this
year through Sept. 12, compared with 1.7 percent for federal
debt and 5.8 percent for tax-free munis, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch data show.  Issuers from California to  Maine  sold $188 billion of Build
Americas in the program’s 21 months, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Congress has resisted renewing it amid Republican
opposition to the program, which subsidizes 35 percent of
issuers’ interest costs. At a time when local-government
interest rates are close to 45-year lows, Build Americas offer a
yield boost that has also lured international buyers who don’t
benefit from traditional munis’ tax exemption.  “It’s really been hard to find” the securities, said
Justin Hoogendoorn, a fixed-income strategist at BMO Capital
Markets in  Chicago . “It’s kind of a food fight.”  Concern that European leaders may fail to contain their
debt crisis has fueled a U.S. fixed-income rally that has
depressed  interest rates  in the $3.7 trillion muni market.  Yields on tax-frees due in 20 years fell to  3.61 percent  in
July, close to a 45-year low, according to a Bond Buyer index.  Yield Quest  Build Americas yield about  4.5 percent  on average, or 1.5
percentage points more than 30-year Treasuries, according to a
Wells Fargo index with a 27-year maturity. Corporate bonds due
in 2042 yield about  0.80 percentage point  more than Treasuries,
according to Moody’s data.  “The additional spread that you see on BABs sets them up
to continue to have pretty favorable return characteristics,”
said Jamie Iselin, who helps oversee $10.5 billion as head of
muni fixed-income at New York-based Neuberger Berman Group LLC.  A Build America bond that  California  issued in 2009 and
that is due in 2039 traded yesterday with an average yield of
5.3 percent, or about 2.35 percentage points above 30-year
Treasuries, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The most-populous state sold about $14 billion of the
bonds, according to the treasurer’s office.  Reinstatement Proposal  The fiscal 2013 budget offered by Obama, a Democrat,
included a proposal to permanently reinstate the program with
lower subsidies of 30 percent through 2013 and 28 percent
beginning in 2014, Michael Zezas, head of muni strategy at
Morgan Stanley in  New York , wrote in a Sept. 4 report.  The securities were intended to lower borrowing costs for
localities and boost job-creating infrastructure spending, from
clean-water projects in  Ohio  to a bridge across the  San
Francisco Bay .  Demand for Build America debt has been fueled by the lower
default rate on munis relative to corporate bonds.  From 1970 to 2011, an average of 0.08 percent of
investment-grade munis that were sold a decade or more earlier
defaulted, compared with 2.61 percent for investment-grade
company bonds, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  “As much as people like to buy corporates, the historical
default rates are much, much lower in municipals,” Hoogendoorn
said. “If you can get that same quality in a taxable municipal
bond, it’s a really attractive item for investors.”  In trading yesterday, yields on 10-year tax-exempts with a
AAA rating rose about 0.02 percentage point to  1.77 percent ,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield touched 1.63 percent
in July, the lowest for a Bloomberg Valuation index starting in
January 2009.  Following are pending sales:  METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY in  New York City  is
set to sell $1 billion of revenue bonds as soon as next week to
refund debt, data compiled by Bloomberg show. (Added Sept. 14)  BAY AREA TOLL AUTHORITY, California, plans to offer $716.5
million of revenue bonds as soon as next week, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Proceeds will refund debt sold in 2006,
according to  Fitch Ratings . (Added Sept. 14)  To contact the reporter on this story:
