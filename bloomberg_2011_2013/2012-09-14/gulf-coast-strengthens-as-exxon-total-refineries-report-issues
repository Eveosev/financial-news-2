Gulf Coast gasoline rose as  Total
SA (FP)  reported an equipment shutdown on a unit at the  Port Arthur ,
Texas, refinery and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  reported an upset at the
Baytown plant.  Total reported that equipment on Unit 812 shut down at Port
Arthur, which can process 174,000 barrels of feedstock a day.
Exxon flared gases at Baytown after an upset occurred in a
fractionation tower of a crude light ends unit, the company said
yesterday in a filing to the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality. It said production wasnâ€™t affected.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline on the
Gulf Coast rose 0.88 cents to 8.38 cents versus futures traded
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:11 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the seventh gain in eight
days. Prompt delivery increased 6.23 cents to 3.1041 a gallon.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in  New York  Harbor rose 2.5 cents to 25 cents a gallon at 2:43
