Corporate bond  offerings  in the
U.S. soared this week to the busiest pace in six months as
borrowing costs tumbled and the  Federal Reserve  unleashed its
third round of quantitative easing to stimulate the economy.  Walgreen Co. (WAG) , the largest U.S. drugstore chain, and London-
based  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  led borrowers selling at least $43.2
billion in bonds, the  most  since $60 billion was issued in the
week ended March 9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Yields on speculative-grade debt dropped to an unprecedented
low, breaking the previous record set more than 15 months ago.  Issuers rushed to sell debt in anticipation that Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  would expand his supply of tools to
attack unemployment stuck above 8 percent since February 2009.
Issuance is on pace for a record September, ignited by the
 European Central Bank ’s announcement Sept. 6 of a bond-buying
program that eased concern of a contagion triggered by a
collapse of the euro.  “It’s a central bank-fueled world right now,” Jon Duensing, the Boulder, Colorado-based head of corporate credit
at money manager Smith Breeden Associates, said in a telephone
interview.  The week started with $19.9 billion of sales on Sept. 10,
eclipsing the $18.7 billion sold on Sept. 4 to become the
busiest day in more than six months, Bloomberg data show.  Monthly Sales  “Usually in a busy day the market has difficulty digesting
that amount of issuance,”  David Brown , a portfolio manager who
helps oversee $89 billion of fixed-income assets at  Neuberger
Berman  in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “These deals
were so well absorbed by the market. Almost all of them
tightened price talk from initial guidance either modestly or
meaningfully.”  Sales this month total $83.8 billion, about twice the
amount sold in the same period last year, Bloomberg data show.  “There’s huge, huge demand for corporate bonds,” Duensing
said. “The primary market is the main place of liquidity for a
lot of people.”  Walgreen, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, sold $4 billion
of bonds in five parts to help repay debt linked to its $6.7
billion acquisition of a 45 percent interest in Alliance Boots
Holdings Ltd., Bloomberg data show.  The drugstore operator issued $550 million of 18-month
floating-rate notes to yield 50 basis points more than the
three-month London interbank offered rate, $750 million of 1
percent, 2.5-year securities at 80 basis points more than
benchmarks, $1 billion of 1.8 percent, five-year bonds at a
spread of 120 basis points, $1.2 billion of 3.1 percent, 10-year
debentures at 145 basis points and $500 million of 4.4 percent,
30-year debt at 165, Bloomberg data show.  Bond Yields  Sales of investment-grade debt reached at least $34.9
billion, Bloomberg data show, an increase from $34.2 billion
last week and compared with a 2012 weekly average of $20.4
billion. Issuance was the most since $51 billion in the five
days ended March 9.  Yields on investment-grade bonds increased from a record-
low 2.978 percent on Sept. 3 to 2.993 percent yesterday, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data show. Spreads decreased 5 basis
points this week to 176 basis points.  The Fed said yesterday it will expand its holdings of long-
term securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of
mortgage debt a month in a third round of quantitative easing.
It will also continue its program to swap $667 billion of short-
term debt with longer-term securities as well as reinvesting its
portfolio of maturing housing debt into agency mortgage-backed
securities.  ‘Economic Growth’  “The committee is concerned that, without further policy
accommodation,  economic growth  might not be strong enough to
generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions,” the
 Federal Open Market Committee  said in a statement at the end of
a two-day meeting in  Washington . It will probably hold the
federal funds  rate  near zero “at least through mid-2015.”  AstraZeneca, the U.K.’s biggest drugmaker after
 GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , raised $2 billion in its first dollar-
denominated sale in five years, Bloomberg data show. The maker
of Nexium issued $1 billion each of 1.95 percent, seven-year
debt and 4 percent, 30-year bonds.  Sales of high-yield bonds reached at least $8.3 billion
this week, the most since $11.4 billion in the week ended Aug.
17, Bloomberg data show. Sales increased from about $6.4 billion
last week and compare with a 2012 weekly average of $5.8
billion.  Yields on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield
Master II index dropped to an unprecedented 7.163 percent on
Sept. 11, breaking the previous record of 7.187 percent set in
May 2011, before falling further to 7.07 percent yesterday,
Bloomberg data show.  Junk Spreads  “Everything is yielding at record lows or near record
lows, particularly among the domestic markets,” Duensing said.
“If you look at relative spread compensation, that’s still more
than adequate given the  default risk .”  Spreads on junk debt decreased 24 basis points this week to
550 basis points, above a low of 241 basis points in June 2007,
index data show.  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) , the largest power producer in  Texas  after
Energy Future Holdings Corp., raised $990 million of 6.625
percent bonds maturing in March 2023, Bloomberg data show. The
bonds are rated B1, the fourth-highest level of speculative-
grade, by Moody’s Investors Service.  Companies planning sales include Mission Health System
Inc., a North Carolina-based hospital operator, raising $250
million of 30-year debt and Munich-based carmaker Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG with a $750 million issue, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
