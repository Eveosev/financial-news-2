U.S.  stocks  advanced for a second
straight week, sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the
highest level since 2007, as the  Federal Reserve ’s plan to buy
mortgage securities fueled demand for riskier assets.  Commodity, financial and industrial shares had the biggest
gains during the week among 10 groups in the S&P 500.  U.S. Steel
Corp. (X)  and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  climbed at least 5.7 percent.  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  increased 8.5 percent as a German court cleared
the way for Europe’s bailout fund.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  rose 1.6 percent
to a record after introducing a new version of the iPhone.  The S&P 500 added 1.9 percent to 1,465.77, extending its
two-week rally to 4.2 percent. The index is 6.8 percent away
from its all-time high set in  October 2007. (SPX)  The Dow Jones
Industrial Average gained 286.73, or 2.2 percent, to 13,593.37.  “We’ve had a good period where everything that could go
right did go right,” said  Russ Koesterich , the San Francisco-
based global chief investment strategist for the IShares unit of
BlackRock Inc. His firm oversees $3.56 trillion. “The rally was
a function of the fact that policy makers delivered, and
probably even a bit more than expected.”  Equities rallied as the Fed said on Sept. 13 that it will
expand its holdings of long-term securities with open-ended
purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt a month in a third
round of quantitative easing as it seeks to boost growth and
reduce unemployment. Stocks also climbed after Germany’s top
constitutional court rejected efforts to block a permanent euro-
area rescue fund.  2012 Gain  Bets on global central bank action and better-than-
estimated corporate profits have taken the S&P 500 up 17 percent
this year. Financial and technology shares, which comprise the
biggest groups in the benchmark measure, surged at least 23
percent in 2012 to lead the gains among 10 groups.  Bank of America became the third Wall Street firm to
forecast  U.S. stocks  will hit a record next year, joining the
ranks of optimists from Laszlo Birinyi to Tobias Levkovich in
saying the bull market will last. The S&P 500 will climb to
1,600 by the end of next year amid record profit growth, Savita
Subramanian, Bank of America’s head of U.S. equity strategy,
wrote in a note.  Citigroup Inc.’s Levkovich and  Brian Belski  at Bank of
Montreal, the other strategists with forecasts for 2013, say the
S&P 500 will rise above its high of 1,565.15 set on Oct. 9,
2007. Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates Inc., predicts
more gains as bearish investors give up and start buying stocks.  “Sentiment and fundamentals are supportive,” Subramanian
said in the research report. “We are optimistic on equities for
the longer term.”  Most Dependent  Companies which are most dependent on the pace of economic
growth led the gains in the S&P 500. The  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Cyclical
Index jumped 4.3 percent. U.S. Steel, the country’s largest
producer of the metal by volume, added 7 percent to $22.35.
Caterpillar, the largest maker of construction and mining
equipment, rose 5.8 percent to $93.17.  Commodity shares rallied the most during the week. The
Standard & Poor’s  GSCI spot gauge  of 24 raw materials jumped 2.6
percent to 694.21, its seventh weekly advance.  Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. (ANR) , which extracts and processes metallurgical coal,
surged 24 percent to $8.55 for the biggest gain in the  S&P 500 .
 Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF)  added 14 percent to $45.55.  The KBW Bank Index of 24 stocks climbed 4.8 percent, the
most since March and its third straight weekly advance. Bank of
America soared 8.5 percent to $9.55.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , which
plunged as much as 24 percent in the month after disclosing a
multibillion-dollar trading loss, erased that decline. The
shares added 5.8 percent to $41.57 for the week.  Morgan Stanley  Morgan Stanley rose 6.8 percent to $18.24. It agreed to buy
the rest of its brokerage joint venture from Citigroup Inc. at a
price that values the entire unit at $13.5 billion -- or about
40 percent less than Citigroup’s estimate two months ago.  Apple jumped 1.6 percent to $691.28. The iPhone 5 boasts a
bigger screen and has a chip that handles tasks more quickly
than past versions. The company said orders for the device from
its online store won’t be shipped for two weeks, fueling
speculation that the new model has sold out.  Facebook Inc. (FB)  added 16 percent to $22. Chief Executive
Officer  Mark Zuckerberg  said at the TechCrunch Disrupt
conference in San Francisco that the company should generate
more revenue from mobile devices than from desktop computers.  The remarks helped allay concerns over Facebook’s ability
to generate sales from users who increasingly socialize over
handheld devices. The stock had  plunged 49  percent since its May
IPO amid signs of slowing growth and executives’ silence over
plans to turn the tide.  Monster Beverage  Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST)  slumped 7.6 percent to $53.77. The
largest U.S. energy drink maker by sales volume tumbled after
two U.S. senators called for greater regulation of the
beverages. The senators also asked for further study of how
energy drinks affect children’s health and that the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration regulate how much caffeine can be
included in the beverages.  UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH)  will replace  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)  in
the Dow, the first change to the 116-year-old U.S. stock
benchmark in three years, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.  Kraft, the world’s second-largest food company, will be
removed from the  Dow average  after deciding to spin off its
North American grocery business. UnitedHealth, the biggest U.S.
health insurer, was chosen because it represents the growing
importance of health-care spending to the  U.S. economy ,
according to the index provider. The change goes into effect at
the opening of trading on Sept. 24, S&P Dow Jones Indices said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
