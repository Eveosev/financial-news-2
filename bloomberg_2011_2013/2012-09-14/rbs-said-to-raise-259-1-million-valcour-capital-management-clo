Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc 
raised a $259.1 million collateralized loan obligation for
Valcour Capital Management LLC, the firmâ€™s first deal, according
to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The fund, Crown Point CLO, includes a $73 million slice
rated AAA that has a coupon of 150 basis points more than the
London interbank offered rate, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the terms are private. The fund has an
additional $93 million AAA piece. Libor is the rate at which
banks say they can borrow in dollars from each other.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  George Marshman, Valcour co-founder, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
