Net  borrowings  by Spanish banks
from the  European Central Bank  rose in August to 388.7 billion
euros ($506.4 billion), underlining funding stresses as deposits
fall and access to debt markets stays restricted.  Net average ECB borrowing climbed from 375.5 billion euros
in July and 69.9 billion euros in August 2011, the Bank of  Spain 
said on its website today.  Gross borrowing  was 411.7 billion
euros, up from 402.2 billion euros in July.  A decline in  bank deposits  is adding to funding pressures
for Spanish banks, of which only the strongest have any access
to wholesale debt markets, said Juan Pablo Lopez, an analyst at
Espirito Santo Investment Bank in  Madrid . Deposits by non-
financial companies and households dipped 26 billion euros in
July from June, according to data from the Bank of Spain.  “Deposits are falling and the deleveraging process is
still getting going for some banks,” Lopez said. “The only
option is the ECB.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
