WPP Plc (WPP) , the world’s biggest
advertising agency, is seeking Turkey’s antitrust approval
through one of its units to buy stakes in advertising agencies
in the country.  Russell Square Holding BV, a unit of WPP, applied to the
Ankara-based regulator to buy 60 percent of Manajans-Thompson
Reklam Isleri AS, 3 percent of JWT Istanbul Reklam Isleri AS and
0.01 percent of Mindshare Medya Hizmetleri AS, the regulator
said on its  website .  Martin Sorrell , chief executive officer of Dublin-based
WPP, has been acquiring digital advertising assets and companies
in developing markets such as China and Brazil, offsetting
slower growth in markets hit by the  European debt crisis .  To contact the reporter on this story:
