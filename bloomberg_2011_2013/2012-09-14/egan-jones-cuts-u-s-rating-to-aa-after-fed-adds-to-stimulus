Egan-Jones Ratings Co. cut its
 credit rating  for the U.S. one level to AA-, citing the
potential for the Federal Reserve’s third round of large-scale
asset purchases to weaken the dollar and drive up inflation.  U.S. debt to gross-domestic-product has risen to 104
percent from 66 percent in 2006, Egan-Jones said today in a
report. The firm lowered the U.S. to AA in April. Yields on 10-
year Treasuries have fallen five basis points since the end of
that month to 1.86 percent.  The Fed’s latest program will “stoke the stock market and
commodity prices, but in our opinion will hurt the  U.S. economy 
and, by extension, credit quality,” Egan-Jones said. “The
increased cost of commodities will pressure profitability of
businesses, and increase the costs of consumers, thereby
reducing consumer purchasing power.”  The Fed yesterday announced its third round of large-scale
asset purchases since 2008, saying it will buy $40 billion of
mortgage debt a month. The central bank didn’t set any limit on
the ultimate amount it would buy or the duration of the program.
Policy makers also extended the prospect of near-zero  interest
rates  until mid-2015 and said policy will stay accommodative
“for a considerable time” even after the economy strengthens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
