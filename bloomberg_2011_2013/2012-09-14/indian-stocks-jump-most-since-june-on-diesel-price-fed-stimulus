Indian (SENSEX)  stocks climbed to their
highest level in 14 months after the government raised diesel
prices for the first time in more than a year and the U.S.
Federal Reserve announced a third round of stimulus measures.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose 2.5 percent
to 18,464.27, its highest close since July 26, 2011. Lenders and
metal producers led the rally, with 10 of the 30 stocks on the
gauge surging more than 4 percent each.  Reliance Industries
Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s largest refining complex, advanced to
a seven-month high.  State Bank of India  soared 5.6 percent.  The  diesel -price increase, the first since June 2011, will
bolster government finances and may increase the chance the
 Reserve Bank  of India will ease monetary policy. Prime Minister
 Manmohan Singh  is trying to reduce a  budget deficit  amid high
inflation, slowing economic growth and the threat of a rating
downgrade from Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings.  The change in fuel costs “is a bold move and is good for
the equity market as it will help the government cut the fiscal
deficit,” Anand Shah, chief investment officer at BNP Paribas
Asset Management India Pvt., said by phone from Mumbai. A lower
fiscal deficit will “eventually bring down  interest rates .”  Indian stocks also gained from a rally in global equities
after the U.S. Fed said yesterday it will undertake open-ended
purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt a month as it seeks to
boost growth and lower unemployment. The Fed’s move followed ECB
President  Mario Draghi ’s earlier statement that the bank has
agreed to an unlimited bond-purchase program.  ‘Concerted Effort’  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index surged 2.4 percent. Futures on
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.5 percent after the
index yesterday rallied to its highest level since 2007, while
the S&P GSCI Index of 24 commodities reached a five-month high.  “It’s all green lights out there, the mark of a concerted
effort globally to really stimulate growth,”  Arjuna Mahendran ,
the Singapore-based head of Asia investment strategy at  HSBC
Private Bank , which oversees $500 billion, told Bloomberg TV
India today. “Growth is flagging globally and central banks are
the only institutions that can do something about it given that
governments face different problems.”  The Sensex has climbed 19 percent this year, helped by the
highest foreign fund inflows among the 10 Asian markets outside
China tracked by Bloomberg. The 30-stock gauge is the world’s
second-best performer among indexes with at least a $1 trillion
market value. Offshore funds bought a net $74 million of shares
yesterday, taking investments this year to $12.8 billion, data
from the regulator show.  ‘Bit the Bullet’  The diesel-price change will help cut revenue losses of
$3.7 billion at state-owned refiners and lower the government’s
subsidy costs as it seeks to curb spending. The refiners sell
fuels at below market prices to curb  inflation , and are partly
compensated by cash payments from the government and discounts
on crude by state-run explorers.  “The government has bit the bullet,”  Indranil Pan , chief
economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., said by e-mail. “This
upward adjustment in prices should not be viewed as a drag on
the economy but as collateral damage for required structural
adjustments.”  India’s inflation was faster than economists estimated in
August, trade ministry data showed today. RBI Governor Duvvuri
Subbarao will leave borrowing costs at 8 percent for a third
meeting on Sept. 17, 31 of 32 economists said in a Bloomberg
survey, as higher fuel costs stoke prices.  Singh is targeting a budget deficit of 5.1 percent of GDP
in the year ending March 31 from 5.8 percent a year ago. Asia’s
third-largest economy expanded 5.5 percent in the June quarter
after growing 5.3 percent in the previous quarter, the least in
three years, according to government data.  ‘Partial Rollback’  Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL) , the largest refiner, dropped 2.3 percent
to 248.8 rupees, and Bharat Petroleum Corp., the second-biggest
state-run refiner, lost 1.3 percent to 350.2 rupees. Hindustan
Petroleum Corp. declined 2.5 percent to 300.25 rupees.  “There’s doubt among investors whether the price increase
can be sustained,” Chokkalingam G, chief investment officer at
Centrum Broking Pvt. in Mumbai, told Bloomberg TV India today.
“We’ve seen it in the past the political strategy of hiking
prices aggressively only to roll them back partially.”  Pantaloon Retail India Ltd. (PF) , the top supermarket operator,
led its peers higher after a report said the government may
decide today to allow foreign investment in multi-brand retail.  Pantaloon surged 7.1 percent, the biggest gain since June
6, to 157.90 rupees.  Shoppers Stop Ltd. (SHOP)  rose 1.2 percent to 356
rupees, the highest since Aug. 27, and  Trent Ltd. (TRENT)  increased 3
percent, after CNBC-TV18 reported the government may ease rules
on overseas ownership of stores selling more than one brand,
citing sources it didn’t identify.  Airline Investment  India’s government on Nov. 24  agreed to allow overseas
companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to own as much as 51
percent of multibrand retail stores, and was forced to reverse
that decision after protests by opposition political parties and
some of Singh’s own allies. The cabinet is scheduled to meet
today and may consider among other decisions allowing foreign
airlines to buy stakes in local carriers, according to two
government officials with direct knowledge of the matter.  Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (JETIN) , the biggest carrier, gained 2.1
percent to  368.65 rupees, its seventh day of advance. Budget
carrier SpiceJet Limited soared 4.4 percent to 34.5 rupees.
 Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. (KAIR)  surged 7.5 percent to 10.8 rupees.  Reliance Industries soared 5.3 percent to 841.75 rupees,
its highest level since Feb. 21.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  jumped 5.1
percent to 1,008 rupees.  State Bank of India  advanced 5.6
percent to 1,971.5 rupees.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the largest
engineering company, added 5.1 percent to 1,490 rupees.  The Sensex is valued at 14.6 times  estimated earnings ,
compared with the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) ’s 11.4 times.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index jumped 2.6 percent to 5,577.65 and
its September futures settled at 5,584.90. The India VIX, which
gauges the cost of protection against losses in the Nifty, fell
1.9 percent to 15.38. The  BSE-200 Index (BSE200)  increased 2.2 percent to
2,231.92. The National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. and BSE Ltd.
 traded  743 million shares yesterday, 16 percent less than the
12-month daily average of 880 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
