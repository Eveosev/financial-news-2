The Bovespa  index  posted its
biggest weekly advance in 11 months as the  Federal Reserve ’s
bond-purchase program spurred a commodities rally, boosting the
outlook for Brazilian exporters.  The Bovespa rose 0.2 percent to 62,105.47 in  Sao Paulo 
today, extending its weekly advance to 6.5 percent. Brazilian
stocks jumped the most in seven weeks yesterday after the Fed
said it will expand holdings of long-term securities with open-
ended purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt a month.  “The Fed’s decision pleased the markets,” Fausto Gouveia,
who helps manage 380 million reais ($189 million) at Legan
Administracao de Recursos, said by phone from Sao Paulo. “The
Bovespa should keep rising toward 65,000 in the near term. In
the longer run, it will all depend on how the global economy
will respond to the central banks’ actions.”  Oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA climbed 1.8 percent to
23.30 reais as crude jumped in New York. The Standard & Poor’s
GSCI index of 24  raw materials  climbed 1 percent. Commodities
producers account for about 43 percent of the Bovespa index’s
weighting. The real strengthened 0.4 percent to 2.0121 per  U.S.
dollar  in Sao Paulo.  The Bovespa  jumped  as much as 2.4 percent earlier today,
extending a rebound from a June 5 low to more than 20 percent,
the threshold for a  bull market .  Steelmakers rallied this week after the government unveiled
measures to cut electricity rates by as much as 28 percent
following an increase in import tariffs last week. Power
companies slumped.  Winners, Losers  “Utilities surely suffered with the government’s plan to
lower energy rates, but on the other hand heavy users of
electricity  gain with this initiative,” Gouveia said. “That
helps explain the recent rally by steelmakers. Some win and some
lose.”  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA ,  Brazil ’s second-
biggest steelmaker, has jumped 24 percent this week to 11.91
reais while Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA is up 30 percent at
13.70 reais, the biggest weekly advance since 1994. The MSCI
Brazil/Materials index gained 2 percent today and jumped 13
percent this week.  Cia. Energetica de Sao Paulo , the state-controlled power
company known as Cesp, gained 3.2 percent to 21.65 reais, today,
paring this week’s slump to 32 percent, the worst performance on
the MSCI Brazil/Utilities index.  Cia. Paranaense de Energia-
Copel  fell 2 percent to 32.65, pushing its weekly drop to 8.9
percent.  Lupatech SA, the Brazilian oil services provider, rose 3.9
percent to 3.17 reais after saying in a regulatory filing it
plans to raise as much as 439.3 million reais in a share sale.  Rate Outlook  Homebuilder Rossi Residencial SA fell 6.3 percent to 5.61
reais, leading declines by companies that sell on credit, as
traders pared bets for more interest rate cuts in Brazil after
data showed economic activity grew in July at the fastest pace
in 11 months.  “The economic recovery is already happening, and with the
external outlook improving, the central bank will probably opt
to keep  interest rates  unchanged for a while,”  Luciano Rostagno , the chief strategist at Banco WestLB do Brasil SA,
said by phone from Sao Paulo.  Swap rates advanced after the central bank said the
economic activity index, a proxy for gross domestic product,
rose 2.34 percent in July from a year earlier after a 0.99
percent gain in the prior month. The median forecast of 23
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 2.1 percent annual
pace of growth.  The Bovespa trades at 13.7 times analysts’ earnings
estimates for the next four quarters, which compares with the
ratio of 11.4 times for MSCI Inc.’s measure of 21 developing
nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume was 11.83 billion reais in stocks in Sao
Paulo yesterday, which compares with a daily average of 7.18
billion reais this year through Sept. 12, according to data
compiled by the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
