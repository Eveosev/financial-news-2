A Turkish court ordered two
hospitalized leaders of  Turkey ’s 1980 military coup to testify
via video-conference, NTV television reported.  Kenan Evren, who led the coup and later became president,
and former  air force  chief Tahsin Sahinkaya are on trial for a
crackdown on political freedom, executions, torture and
disappearances committed under their command.  While both retired generals have said they can’t attend
hearings for medical reasons, the Ankara court ruled today that
they should testify in a video-conference in the next hearing on
Nov. 20, according to NTV, which cited unnamed court officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
