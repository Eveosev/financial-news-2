The Environmental Protection Agency
said gasoline refiners must use 1.28 billion gallons of
biodiesel next year, under a program that was hit by fraud
earlier this year.  The mandate under the program, which is meant to boost
production of renewable fuels, is a 28 percent increase from a 1
billion gallon requirement this year.  The action “is another step that strengthens America’s
energy security by reducing dependence on foreign oil,” EPA
Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said today in a statement.  Under federal law, refiners such as  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  must produce biodiesel each year, with their
contribution determined by their share of the fuel market. Under
rules set by the EPA, instead of producing fuel themselves,
those refiners can buy credits from other producers to fulfill
their obligations.  That market in credits for the cleaner fuel seized up after
federal prosecutors accused two companies, Clean Green Fuels and
Absolute Fuels LLC, of selling fraudulent credit certificates.  The  National Biodiesel Board , a Washington-based group
representing producers, said it is using an outside auditing
process to prevent any new cases of fraud. The EPA also is
working with producers and refiners on new rules to tighten
enforcement, and said it will complete the process this year.  As a result of the fraud investigations, refiners are leery
about buying credits from smaller producers, according to
congressional testimony in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
