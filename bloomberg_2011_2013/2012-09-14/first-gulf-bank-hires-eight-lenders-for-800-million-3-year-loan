First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB) , a lender
controlled by  Abu Dhabi â€™s ruling family, said it hired eight
banks to arrange an $800 million loan, the third Middle Eastern
bank to borrow from the syndicated loan market since August.  The three-year facility will be provided by Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., Citigroup Inc., Commerzbank AG, Deutsche
Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc,  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) ,
 National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD)  and Standard Chartered Bank,
according to an e-mailed statement from Mizuho. BTMU is facility
agent and coordinator.  The loan will pay an interest margin of 130 basis points
more than the London interbank offered rate, lenders said in the
statement. The bank has a $825 million syndicated loan maturing
in November 2012, Bloomberg data show. That loan, signed in
November 2007, pays an interest margin of 27.5 basis points over
Libor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Qatar National Bank signed a $1.8 billion three-year loan
with banks on Aug. 8. National Bank of Oman got a $250 million
three-year loan on Aug. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
