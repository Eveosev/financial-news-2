Juventus cut its fiscal-year loss
by nearly half as the Italian soccer club benefited from the
opening of a new stadium.  The loss for the 12 months ended June 30 was 48.7 million
euros ($64 million), compared with a loss of 95.4 million euros
in the year earlier period, Juventus said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Revenue rose 24 percent to 213.8 million euros as the club
increased its income from ticket sales at its stadium and got an
increase from its television and radio rights. The team won
 Italy â€™s Serie A last season for its 30th league title.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
