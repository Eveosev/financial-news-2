More than 5,000 people went to the
Japanese Embassy in Beijing to protest against  Japan ’s purchase
of the disputed Diaoyu Islands from a private citizen, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported today, citing police.  In Yunnan province in the southwest, about 100 people
demonstrated in Tengchong city, Xinhua said. The personal safety
of Japanese citizens in  China  is protected, Xinhua said
separately, citing foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei  Anti-Japan sentiment is rising in China as the row over the
uninhabited islands, called Senkaku in Japanese, escalated this
week after Japan announced the purchase. China said it didn’t
accept the move.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Aipeng Soo in
