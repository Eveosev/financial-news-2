More than 50 Afghan civilians
traveling in a bus were burnt to death today in eastern Ghazni
province after their vehicle struck a fuel tanker.  The public bus was on the highway linking Kabul and
Kandahar provinces at the time of the accident, Abdul Wali
Khanzada, a member of the Ghazni provincial council, said in a
phone interview. Only a few of those killed died in the initial
impact, he said, adding that there had been a single survivor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
