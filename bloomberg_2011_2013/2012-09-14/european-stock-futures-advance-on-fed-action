     Sept. 14 (Bloomberg) -- European (SXXP)  stocks advanced to their
highest level in 15 months after the  Federal Reserve  said it
will buy mortgage-backed securities to encourage economic growth
in the world’s largest economy.  BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group both jumped at least
6 percent as Australia’s Treasurer said the country’s resource
boom will continue.  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  rose 5 percent as it resumed
talks with striking miners at its platinum mine in  South Africa .  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 1.3 percent to 275.95
at the close, its highest level since June 1, 2011. The equity
benchmark has  rallied 18 percent from this year’s low  on June 4
and has gained 1.3 percent this week.  “This kind of liquidity helps equity markets a lot,” said
Theodore Krintas, who helps manage 80 million euros ($105
million) as the managing director of Attica Wealth Management in
Athens. “If we get some positive news from the European meeting
in Cyprus, I would expect this direction to gain momentum within
the next days.”  The Fed said it will increase its holdings of long-term
securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of mortgage
debt a month. The central bank will continue to buy mortgage-
backed securities until the outlook for the labor market
substantially improves, the  Federal Open Market Committee  said
yesterday in a statement at the end of its two-day meeting in
Washington.  Earnings Projections  The FOMC also said it will probably hold the federal funds
rate near zero until at least the middle of 2015. The Fed had
said  the rate  would stay low through late 2014. Fed officials
said economic growth will improve faster than they had
projected, as they upgraded their estimates for gross domestic
product growth in 2013 and 2014.  Euro-area finance ministers and central-bank officials hold
a two-day meeting starting today in Cyprus to discuss plans for
a banking union in the 17-nation currency zone.  European stocks extended their gains after the Thomson

adhere to regulations from the European Union. Greece had

percent greater than the average of the last 30 days, according
