Brazil ’s longer-term swap rates
rose after a report showed economic activity grew in July at the
fastest pace in 11 months, reducing speculation that the central
bank will sustain the pace of cuts in borrowing costs.  The real extended its gain driven by the  Federal Reserve ’s
announcement yesterday of more stimulus after Brazil’s central
bank sold 11 percent of 70,000 reverse currency swap contracts
offered in a second auction today to limit the  exchange rate .
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said the government will maintain
an active currency policy to avoid excessive appreciation or
depreciation of the real.  Swap rates on contracts due in January 2016 increased two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.94 percent in Sao
Paulo. The real gained 0.4 percent to 2.0121 per dollar after
touching 2.0075, the strongest intraday level since Aug. 21. The
currency climbed 0.8 percent this week.  The economic pickup “corroborates the central bank’s
indication that the economy could be growing around 4 percent
annualized by year-end,” said  Newton Rosa , the chief economist
at SulAmerica Investimentos, in a phone interview from Sao
Paulo.  The non-seasonally adjusted economic activity index rose
2.34 percent in July from a year earlier after a 0.99 percent
gain in the prior month, the central bank reported. The median
forecast of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 2.1
percent annual pace of growth.  The central bank sold 7,400 of 70,000 reverse swap
contracts offered in its second auction today including 2,200
contracts due in November for $110 million and 5,200 contracts
due in December for $260 million.  Second Auction  Today’s second swap auction attracted less demand after
many investors had already rolled over their contracts in the
first auction, said Jose Carlos Amado, a foreign-exchange trader
at Renascenca Dtvm Ltda.  “Demand was stronger in the morning because you had a
bigger lot expiring,” he said in a phone interview from  Sao
Paulo . “The market prefers to do rollovers instead of buying
new contracts.”  The real pared its gain after the central bank sold in
today’s first auction 35,700 of 36,000 contracts offered
including 11,100 due in November for $554 million and 24,600 due
in October for $1.23 billion.  The currency at 2 per  U.S. dollar  allows manufacturers to
remain competitive, Mantega said in Sao Paulo. Trade Minister
Fernando Pimentel said today the government won’t give up on
making the real competitive and will continue to intervene.  The real has fallen 7.2 percent this year, the most among
16 major counterparts against the U.S. currency tracked by
Bloomberg.  ‘Plastered’ Market  “In Brazil, the market has been plastered,” said
 Reginaldo Galhardo , a trader at Treviso Corretora, in a phone
interview from Sao Paulo. “There is no way for the real to gain
beyond 2 per dollar the way Mantega and the central bank are
treating the exchange rate.”  Most of the major currencies including the  Mexican peso 
rallied after the Fed said yesterday it plans to buy mortgage
securities and hold its target lending rate near zero until at
least the middle of 2015.  Brazil’s policy makers have cut the target lending rate
nine times since August 2011 to a record low 7.5 percent to
bolster economic growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
