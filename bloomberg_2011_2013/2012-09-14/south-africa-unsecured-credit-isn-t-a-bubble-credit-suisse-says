South Africa ’s personal loans
market isn’t a bubble because of the relatively high cost of
funding and short duration of debt, according to  Credit Suisse
Group AG. (CSGN)   “Although some of the classic signs of a credit bubble are
present, we do not believe the situation is unhealthy and that a
credit bubble has not built up,” Johannesburg-based Credit
Suisse analysts Mervin Naidoo and Dean Ginsberg wrote in a
report today.  While South African consumers are under pressure from food
prices and fuel costs, shoppers “appear to be moderating
discretionary spend to balance consumption with disposable
income,” according to the note.  Unsecured loans accounted for 9 percent of consumer credit
at the end of March in  Africa ’s largest economy, up from 8
percent three months earlier, according to the  National Credit
Regulator .  To contact the reporter on this story:
