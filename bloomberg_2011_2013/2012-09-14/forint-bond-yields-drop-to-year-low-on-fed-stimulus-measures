Hungarian benchmark bonds gained,
sending yields to a one-year low as U.S. Federal Reserve
stimulus measures boosted investor appetite for riskier
emerging-market assets.  A rally in the government’s five-year bonds cut yields by
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 6.838 percent.
The currency of  Hungary , the most indebted eastern member of the
European Union, depreciated 0.2 percent to 282.78 per euro by
5:09 p.m. in Budapest, paring its five-day gain to 0.6 percent,
the first weekly advance in more than a month.  Developing-nation stocks jumped the most in 11 months and
currencies gained after the Fed said it will expand holdings of
long-term securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of
mortgage debt a month and hold the federal funds rate near zero
“at least through mid-2015.”  “The Fed decision caused a substantial drop in yields,”
Zoltan Arokszallasi, an analyst at Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in
an e-mailed report today.  The  International Monetary Fund  has no date set for a
return visit to Hungary to continue financial-aid talks, Gerry
Rice, a spokesman for the Washington-based lender, told
reporters yesterday.  The delay in the IMF talks limited the forint’s rally this
month, Levente Blaho and Adam Keszeg, analysts at  Raiffeisen
Bank International AG (RBI) , wrote in an e-mailed report today.
Hungary’s currency advanced 0.5 percent in September, less than
the 1.8 percent jump for the Czech koruna and 2.6 percent rally
for the zloty, the best performer worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
