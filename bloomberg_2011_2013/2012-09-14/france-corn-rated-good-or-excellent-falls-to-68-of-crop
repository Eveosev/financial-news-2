French corn rated as good or
excellent fell 1 percentage point in the week through Sept. 10
on worsening conditions in Aquitaine, the biggest growing
region, as dry weather prompted water-use restrictions.  Corn that received the top ratings dropped to 68 percent
from 69 percent the previous week, crop office FranceAgriMer
wrote in a report on its  website  today. That’s down from 77
percent rated good or excellent a month ago, and compares with
81 percent at the same time last year.  Southwest  France , including the Aquitaine region that grows
20 percent of the country’s corn, got 58 percent less rain that
usual in August, Agriculture Ministry data show. Water-use
restrictions were in place in 50 of France’s 96 mainland
departments as of midnight, three more departments than a week
ago, according to the  Environment Ministry .  Crop conditions in Aquitaine deteriorated again, with corn
getting the top two ratings falling to 63 percent from 66
percent a week earlier and 75 percent two weeks ago.  The portion of French corn at 50 percent or less grain
humidity, an indicator of crop maturity, increased to 76 percent
from 51 percent a week earlier, FranceAgriMer said. At the same
time last year, 84 percent of corn had reached the stage of 50
percent grain humidity, the data show. Corn kernel moisture
decreases as the grain develops.  Harvesting of France’s soft wheat, durum wheat and barley
has been completed, according to FranceAgriMer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
