Asian currencies completed their
biggest weekly advance since December after the  Federal Reserve 
announced a third round of bond purchases, underpinning inflows
to higher-yielding emerging-market assets.  Malaysia’s ringgit and Thailand’s baht reached four-month
highs as Asian stocks posted their biggest weekly advance in
2012. The Fed said Sept. 13 it will expand its holdings of long-
term securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of
mortgage debt a month, while pledging to hold  interest rates 
near zero at least through mid-2015. The  European Central Bank 
agreed this month to unlimited bond-buying and China said this
week it will use preemptive policy to bolster growth.  “Optimism that funds will flow to Asia from the QE3 is
supporting Asian currencies and stocks,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a
Bangkok-based foreign-exchange trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp. “Asian currencies will probably see appreciation pressure
for a while.”  The ringgit strengthened 2.4 percent this week to 3.0338
per dollar in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The baht advanced 1.5 percent to 30.75, Taiwan’s
dollar gained 1.3 percent to NT$29.469 and South Korea’s won
rose 1.2 percent to 1,117.30 following a credit-rating upgrade.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index , which tracks the
region’s most-active currencies, climbed 0.9 percent this week
to 116.92, the most since the five days ended Dec. 2, 2011. The
gauge’s 60-day historical volatility dropped to 3.42 percent
from 3.45 percent on Sept. 7.  Korea Upgrade  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 3.8 percent this week,
the biggest gain since December. Global funds bought $969
million more South Korean and Taiwanese stocks than they sold
this week through Sept. 13, taking net purchases for those
countries this year to $12 billion, exchange data show.  The won reached the strongest level since March, extending
gains after  Standard & Poor’s  raised the nation’s long-term
foreign-currency rating by one step to A+, the fifth-highest
level. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also raised
their grades on Korea in the past three weeks.  “The upgrade reflects our less negative assessment of the
geopolitical risks on the Korean peninsula,” S&P said in a
statement.  The  Bank of Korea  kept its seven-day repurchase rate at 3
percent on Sept. 13, a move predicted by just one of 16
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest forecast a 25 basis
point cut. Indonesia and Philippines also kept borrowing costs
unchanged Sept. 13.  Yuan Rally  China’s  yuan  appreciated 0.45 percent this week to 6.3145
per dollar in Shanghai, the most in seven months, according to
the China Foreign Exchange System. Premier  Wen Jiabao  said on
Sept. 11 that China has “ample strength” to use fiscal and
monetary policy to boost the economy, which grew 7.6 percent
last quarter, the slowest pace in more than three years.  “We believe Asian central banks like China and Singapore
will ease monetary policy going into the year-end,” said Roy Teo, a currency strategist at ABN Amro Private Bank in
Singapore. “Currency strength could impede export recovery so
there’s a need to balance that.”  Elsewhere, the  Philippine peso  advanced 0.6 percent this
week to 41.405 per dollar, the strongest level since April 2008.
India’s rupee advanced 2 percent to 54.3075, Indonesia’s rupiah
rose 0.9 percent to 9,505 and Vietnam’s dong was little changed
at 20,850.  To contact the reporter on this story:
