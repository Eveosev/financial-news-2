About 6,000 trucks carrying goods
to Middle Eastern countries are waiting to cross from Turkey
into Iraq after clashes virtually shut down the Syrian route,
Anatolia said today.  The queue stretched for more than 30 kilometers (19 miles)
at the Habur border crossing, the state-run Turkish  news agency 
said. Several Turkish truckers have come under attack in Syria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
