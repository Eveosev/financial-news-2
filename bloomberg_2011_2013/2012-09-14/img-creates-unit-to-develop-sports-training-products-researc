IMG Worldwide, the sports agency
that represents  Rafael Nadal  and  Maria Sharapova , is creating a
division to design products and services to improve performance
training.  The unit, called IMG Performance, will include IMG Academy,
which for 30 years has provided training programs for adults,
professional athletes, teams and leagues around the world, the
company said in an e-mailed statement.  “We’re reaching an exciting time in the history of IMG
Academy, in which we are witnessing the potential for impact
that our sports performance training methodologies and services
can have beyond the walls of the IMG Academy campus,” George
Pyne, president of IMG Sports & Entertainment, said in the
statement.  Located on a 400-acre campus in Bradenton, Florida, IMG
Academy offers training programs for tennis, golf, basketball,
baseball, soccer, lacrosse and football.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
