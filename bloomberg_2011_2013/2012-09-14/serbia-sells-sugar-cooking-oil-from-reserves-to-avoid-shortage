Serbia ’s government will sell 5
million liters of cooking oil and 5,000 tons of sugar from  state
reserves  to prevent shortages after a weak harvest.  The commodities will be offered with capped retail prices
at 142.6 dinars ($1.61) per liter of oil and 95 dinars per
kilogram of sugar to counter price pressures and ensure a stable
supply, the government’s press office said in an e-mailed
statement after a Cabinet meeting today.  Serbia banned exports of sunflower seed and sugar beet on
Sept. 6 after a drought cut the harvests by 24 percent to
327,000 tons and 12 percent to 2.47 million tons respectively.
The Balkan nation consumes about 100,000 tons of cooking oil and
about 200,000 tons of sugar a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
