Gerhard Richter  plays with chance
in his “Strip Paintings” (2012).  He uses tech-driven rules to create the unpredictable and
then steps in to shape the chaos. The result: stunning,
psychedelically-colored works.  Also on view: “6 Standing Glass Panels” (2002/2011).  “Gerhard Richter: Painting 2012” runs through Oct. 13 at
Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 W. 57th St. Information: +1-212-977-
7160;  http://www.mariangoodman.com .  Saturday Matinee  Douglas Hodge pastes on the wistful swashbuckler’s nose for
a new production of “Cyrano de Bergerac” and Clemence Poesy
takes on the role of his true love.  In previews at the American Airlines Theatre, 227 W. 42nd
St., for an Oct. 11 opening. Information: +1-212-719-1300;

for some lively American cuisine, like orange-dusted Maine
lobster salad with artichokes.  At 622 Tenth Ave. Information: +1-212-977-1170.  Saturday Night  Florence & the Machine is playing the Jones Beach Theater.  The pop goddess will belt out the group’s arty anthemic
tunes. Expect to hear “Shake It Out,” “Bedroom Hymns,” plus
music from “Ceremonials.”  Brit indie rock band the Maccabees opens.  If this theater had a roof, Flo would blow it off.  Information: +1-866-558-8468;

experience “Einstein on the Beach.”  Scored by  Philip Glass , directed by  Robert Wilson  with
choreography by Lucinda Childs, the 1976 opera is a meditation
on time.  References to the atomic age, mathematics and true love
circulate as characters come, go, return.  Runs through Sept. 23 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30
Lafayette Ave., Brooklyn. Information: +1-718-636-4100;

-- it was originally carved into a cave in northern China.  There are also big Buddhas with their sacred attendants,
among the best examples ever excavated.  In this exhibition of the artwork of Xiangtangshan, digital
technology brings the caves back to life.  Runs through Jan. 6 at the Institute for the Study of the
Ancient World at  New York  University, 15 E. 84th St.
Information: +1-212-992-7800;  http://isaw.nyu.edu .  Sunday Afternoon  Try some cannoli or a hot sausage at the 86th annual feast
of San Gennaro, now happening in Little Italy.  What began as a religious ceremony among newly arrived
immigrants from Naples has become a giant street fair, lasting
11 days.  Crowds throng the aromatic food carts while enjoying the
games, music and processions.  Runs from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. along Mulberry St. between
Houston and Canal Streets.  Information:  http://www.sangennaro.org .  Sunday Evening  Check out the legendary Joshua Light Show, still going
strong after creating psychedelic projections for the likes of
the Grateful Dead,  Jimi Hendrix  and  Janis Joplin .  Debo Band combines Ethiopian funk with rock and jazz, while
Forro in the Dark plays Brazilian party music.  Both get the Light Show treatment at  New York University ’s
Skirball Center for the Performing Arts.  At 566 LaGuardia Place. Information: +1-212-998-4941;
