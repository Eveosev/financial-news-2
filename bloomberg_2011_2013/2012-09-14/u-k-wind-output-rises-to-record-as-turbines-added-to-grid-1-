Wind power generation in the U.K. climbed to a record as more turbines, owned by companies such as  SSE Plc (SSE) , are connected to the grid in a bid to meet 2020 renewable energy targets.  Output into the network from  wind  rose to 4,010 megawatts at 10 p.m. London time yesterday, according to  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data on Bloomberg. Turbines were generating 3,900 megawatts, or 10.6 percent of the U.K.’s power supply, at 9 a.m. today, the data show.  The U.K. is increasing wind capacity and seeks to install a total of 18 gigawatts of offshore wind farms and 13 gigawatts of onshore turbines by 2020. Current combined capacity is about 7.4 gigawatts, according to the lobby group  RenewableUK .  “Continued installation of wind farms will mean we will keep seeing record production,”  Chris Rogers , a senior analyst at Bloomberg Industries in London, said today by e-mail. “The bigger issue is whether National Grid can accommodate all this production -- we have already seen earlier this summer situations where the grid has had to constrain output.”  All 140 turbines at the 500-megawatt Greater Gabbard offshore farm in the Thames Estuary, a venture between SSE and  RWE AG (RWE) ’s Npower unit, have been commissioned and have started exporting power to the grid, the company said Sept. 7.  Wind generation is forecast to fall to 2,855 megawatts at midnight, grid data show. U.K. power for tomorrow rose 1.19 percent to 43 pounds ($69.64) a megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The presence of more, low-cost wind capacity in theory should reduce spot prices throughout the year,” Rogers said. “In reality a complex interplay between natural gas prices and weather conditions make spot prices very difficult to predict.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Rachel Morison in  London  at   rmorison@bloomberg.net ; Alex Morales in London at   amorales2@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Lars Paulsson at   lpaulsson@bloomberg.net
