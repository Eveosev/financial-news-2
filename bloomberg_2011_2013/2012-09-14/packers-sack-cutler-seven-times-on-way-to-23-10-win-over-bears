The  Green Bay  Packers sacked
Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler seven times on their way to
a 23-10 win in Week 2 of the  National Football League .  After Mason Crosby kicked a 48-yard field goal in the
second quarter to put Green Bay 3-0 ahead, Packers punter Tim Masthay threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to backup tight end Tom Crabtree as they faked a field goal. Crosby added another field
goal, from 35 yards, to make it 13-0 at halftime at Lambeau
Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin, last night.  Robbie Gould got the only score in the third quarter with a
45-yard field goal to make it 13-3 before Crosby kicked a 54-
yard field goal in the fourth quarter and Donald Driver gathered
a 26-yard touchdown pass from  Aaron Rodgers  to make it 23-3.  Kellen Davis collected a 21-yard scoring pass from Cutler
with six minutes, 49 seconds remaining to complete the scoring.  Cutler was sacked 3 1/2 times by  Clay Matthews  and threw
four interceptions while completing 11 of 27 passes for 126
yards. Rodgers was sacked five times and succeeded with 22 of 32
pass attempts for 219 yards, a touchdown and an interception.  The Packers lost their opening game of the regular season
30-22 against the  San Francisco 49ers , while the Bears began the
season with a 41-21 win over the Indianapolis Colts.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
