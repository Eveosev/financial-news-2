Eni SpA (ENI)  rose to the highest in
almost four years in Milan trading after state lender Cassa
Depositi e Prestiti SpA sold a stake in Italy’s biggest energy
company.  Eni gained 4.2 percent to 18.70 euros, the highest price
since November 2008, giving the Rome-based company a market
value of 68 billion euros ($89.4 billion).  Cassa Depositi yesterday said it sold 61.7 million Eni
shares between Aug. 7 and Sept. 13 at an average price of 17.76
euros a share. The Rome-based bank now holds 27.4 percent of
Eni.  Eni said it expects to complete the sale of a 30 percent
stake of  Snam SpA (SRG) , Italy’s gas-network operator, to CDP for 3.5
billion euros by October. Yesterday’s announcement makes it
probable that transaction will be concluded on schedule, said
