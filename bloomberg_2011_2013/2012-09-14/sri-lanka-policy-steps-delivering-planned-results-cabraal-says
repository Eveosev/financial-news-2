Sri Lanka ’s measures to improve its
balance of payments and control the trade deficit are delivering
results as planned, Ajith Nivard Cabraal, governor of the
 Central Bank of Sri Lanka , said today.  Cabraal spoke in an interview in his office in Colombo.  On policy measures:  “We are confident that the measures will take us through
to the end of the year. The policy structure is well in place
and delivered what we planned. What we did was preparing
ourselves for 2013 and it is well on course.  “2012 seems to be well on track to deliver what we had
planned, the balance of payments in surplus, and the trade
deficit being controlled.”  On growth:  “Since there’s been a drought, there has been some concern
that adjustment may be needed in the growth numbers. Even if so,
it may not be much.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
