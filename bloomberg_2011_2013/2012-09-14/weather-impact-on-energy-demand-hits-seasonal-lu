Cooler weather in the U.S. Midwest
and East in coming weeks may have little impact on energy demand
because this isn’t the time of year for temperature extremes,
said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Temperatures are expected to fall 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit
(1.7 to 2.8 Celsius) below normal across the Midwest from Sept.
19 to Sept. 23. The cool will spread to the East Coast from
Sept. 24 to Sept. 28, said Rogers, based in Bethesda,  Maryland .  The weather at this time of year tends to be mild and a few
degrees above or below normal aren’t enough to trigger strong
power use, as can be the case with heat in July and August and
cold in January and February. Warmer-than-normal temperatures
last October to March cut demand for natural gas for heating.  “From what I can tell, the excitement about this cooler
pattern is more about the chances it may continue in October
rather than what it does right now,” Rogers said in an e-mail
interview today.  The average low temperature in  New York City  on Sept. 18 is
65 degrees, which is also the benchmark used to calculate
heating and cooling degree days. That’s the temperature at which
energy isn’t supposed to be needed to either warm or cool.  The normal average temperature in New York on Sept. 21 is
68 degrees, or 10 degrees less than in July, according to MDA
EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The normal average
is 64 in  Boston , 70 in Washington, 72 in Atlanta, 63 in Chicago,
78 in Houston, 60 in Seattle and 72 in  Burbank , California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
