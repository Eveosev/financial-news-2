Wheat futures jumped to a one-month
high as commodities rallied after the  Federal Reserve  announced
a third round of monetary measures to bolster the  U.S. economy .  The Fed said yesterday it would make additional debt
purchases in a third round of so-called quantitative easing. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials rose to a
five month high. Wheat has surged 42 percent this year after a
U.S. Midwest drought scorched corn crops, reducing supplies of
grain used to make livestock feed.  “The markets are feeding off the QE3,” Mike Zuzolo, the
president of Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting in
Lafayette,  Indiana , said by telephone. “This kicks in some
money from the funds that will increase their exposure to the
wheat complex.”  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 2.5 percent to
settle at $9.2425 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier, the price reached $9.31, the highest for a most-
active contract since Aug. 10. This week, the grain advanced 2.1
percent, the third straight increase.  The U.S. is the world’s top wheat exporter. The grain is
the nation’s fourth-largest crop, valued at $14.4 billion in
2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
