The  European Investment Bank  is
considering a loan of as much as 480 million euros ($628
million) for the Housing Finance Corporation Ltd. to build low-
rent energy efficient homes in the U.K.  The EIB finance would pay for programs to retrofit older
properties or build new ones mainly in London, the European
Unionâ€™s lending arm said today in a  statement  on its website.
The total cost is about 959 million euros and each building
program would cost less than 50 million euros, the bank said.  The Housing Finance Corporation, based in London, makes
loans to social landlords who provide affordable homes to
tenants in need of housing. The organization funds itself
through bond issues and bank borrowing, according to its
 website .  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
