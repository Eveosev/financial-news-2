Canada’s dollar rallied to a more
than 13-month high against its U.S. counterpart as the  Federal
Reserve ’s plan to purchase bonds spurred demand for higher-
yielding assets.  The U.S. central bank said yesterday it would keep  interest
rates  near zero until 2015 and begin buying mortgage securities
to spur the economy of Canada’s biggest trading partner. The so-
called loonie rose to a more than six-month high against Japan’s
yen, where interest rates are also near zero.  “To the extent that the  U.S. dollar  remains under
pressure, this is a broad move and the Canadian dollar is going
with it,” said  David Watt , chief economist at HSBC Bank Canada
in Toronto. However, the Canadian dollar “will run out of steam
and I can’t see us getting back to the lows we saw in July
2011.”  The Canadian dollar rose 0.4 percent to 96.49 cents per
U.S. dollar at 8:30 a.m. in Toronto. It touched 96.33 cents, the
strongest since Aug. 4. One Canadian dollar buys $1.03638.  The currency touched 94.07 cents per dollar on July 26,
2011. Its record is 90.58 cents with the decade average of
C$1.1518.  The loonie, as the currency is known because of the
waterfowl on the C$1 coin, rose as much as 1.3 percent to 81.008
yen, the strongest since May 4, before trading at 80.841 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
