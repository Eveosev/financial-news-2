Latvia repaid early 152 million
lats ($287 million) of its loan from the  International Monetary
Fund  to reduce interest payments.  The Baltic country will save almost 3 million lats in
interest payments with the move, the  Finance Ministry  in Riga
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Latvia was forced in 2008 to turn to a group led by the
European Commission and IMF for a 7.5 billion-euro ($9.9
billion) loan after the second-biggest bank, Parex, needed a
state rescue. It only drew down 4.4 billion euros from its
bailout package.  Latviaâ€™s gross domestic product, which plunged more than 20
percent in 2008 and 2009, has risen for two years and advanced
5.1 percent from a year earlier in the second quarter, outpacing
the rest of the 27-member EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
