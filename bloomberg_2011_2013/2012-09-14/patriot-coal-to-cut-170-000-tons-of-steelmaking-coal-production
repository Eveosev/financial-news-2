Patriot Coal Corp. (PCXCQ) , the U.S. mining
company that’s reorganizing under  bankruptcy protection , said it
would temporarily idle mines to cut 85,000 tons of output per
month for an indefinite period.  Production of metallurgical coal will be cut at the Kanawha
Eagle, Rocklick and Wells mines in southern West Virginia, St.
Louis-based Patriot said in a statement today. The company said
250 employee and contractor positions will be “impacted” by
the actions.  “These actions are designed to bring our production in
line with expected sales and focus capital resources on our
lowest cost operations as we proceed with our reorganization,”
Chief Operating Officer Bennett K. Hatfield said in the
statement.  Patriot filed for bankruptcy in July, saying milder winters
and a shift to natural gas sent demand for coal to a 24-year
low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
