Former European Central Bank
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said that indebted euro-area
governments must use the time the ECB has bought for them to
implement reforms.  “The message is that this time is given to do the hard
work which is absolutely necessary,” Trichet said at an event
in  Madrid  today. If conditions aren’t respected, “we take the
risk that other partners, the private sector, the public sector,
the surveillance authorities and the governments themselves take
advantage of the time which is given by the central bank.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
