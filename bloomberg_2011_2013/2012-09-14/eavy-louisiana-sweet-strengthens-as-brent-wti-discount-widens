Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil
strengthened to the largest premium against futures in five
months as the gap between the U.S. benchmark and London-traded
 Brent crude  widened.  The discount of November West Texas Intermediate widened 29
cents to $17.54 a barrel. When Brent gains versus WTI, it
typically strengthens the value of U.S. grades that compete with
foreign oils priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
widened $2 a barrel to $20.25 at 4:01 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the largest
premium for the grade since April 13.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark added
$1.15 to $19.15 a barrel.  Poseidon’s  premium  narrowed 25 cents to $12.25. Mars Blend
weakened 50 cents to $12.25 a barrel over WTI and Southern Green
Canyon lost 60 cents to a premium of $10.90.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, lost 25 cents to
$16.50 above WTI.  In  Canada , Syncrude’s premium to WTI was steady at $13.50 a
barrel.  Western Canada Select’s discount was steady at $8.50 a
barrel below the U.S. benchmark. Bakken’s premium was unchanged
at $4.25 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
