Kuwait Petroleum Corp. is
interested in acquiring  OMV AG (OMV) ’s filling stations in  Croatia  and
Bosnia-Herzegovina through a subsidiary, Zagreb-based  Vecernji
List  reported, without saying how it got the information.  OMV, central Europe’s biggest oil company, has 63 stations
in Croatia and 28 in Bosnia. The sale of the stations is at an
“advanced stage” and should be completed this year, Manfred Leitner, OMV’s refining and marketing chief, said on Aug. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
