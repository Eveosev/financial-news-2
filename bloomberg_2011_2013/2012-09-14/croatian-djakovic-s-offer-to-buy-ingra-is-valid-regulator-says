Djuro Djakovic d.d. ,  Croatia ’s
largest heavy-vehicle maker, can proceed with its offer to
acquire  Ingra d.d. , a Zagreb-based construction company, the
market regulator known as  Hanfa  said in a statement on its
 website .  Djakovic’s offer of 6 kuna ($1) per share for Ingra, made
on July 16, satisfies trading rules, the regulator said. Trading
in both companies shares was suspended on the Zagreb stock
exchange, Hanfa said. Ingra last traded at 5.24 kuna per share
today.  Djakovic is based in Slavonski Brod, Croatia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
