Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF)  rose to the
highest since October on speculation  Federal Reserve  easing
measures will boost global equities, bolstering Canada’s third-
largest insurer’s earnings.  The  stock  rose as much as 5.59 percent in Toronto today,
the largest intraday increase since April 12, to C$24.95, the
highest since April 19. The Toronto-based company is up 32
percent this year.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index added 139.99
points, or 1.1 percent, to 12,500.15 at 3:20 p.m. in Toronto.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday the
central bank will spend more than $40 billion per month on
mortgage bond purchases to spur growth.  “It all comes down to the actions the Fed,” said  Peter Routledge , Financial Analyst at  National Bank of Canada .
Yesterday’s announcement will spur equity gains, he said.  “While this is good for all life companies, it is
particularly good for Sun Life,” Routledge said, citing the
company’s U.S. unit MFS Investment Management.  Insurers are helped by rising equities because they
increase investment income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
