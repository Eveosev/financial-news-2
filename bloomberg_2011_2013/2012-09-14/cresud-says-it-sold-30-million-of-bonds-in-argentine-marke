Cresud SACIF y A ,  Argentina ’s
largest publicly traded agriculture company, sold $30 million of
dollar-linked bonds, the Buenos Aires-based company said today
in a filing sent to the market regulator.  Investors paid 105.2 percent of the bond’s face value that
carries a 7.75 percent fixed coupon, Cresud said. Cresud
received $72 million in offers from investors to buy the bond
that will mature on June 23 2014, the company said.  Proceeds from the sale will be used to finance its
2012-2013 crop planting and to repay debt, Cresud said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
