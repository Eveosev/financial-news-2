The  Inter-American Development Bank 
has agreed to lend Venezuela $400 million for two projects to
improve water treatment in the South American country.  The bank will lend Venezuela $300 million to finance works
in 12 subbasins of the Guaire river that runs through Caracas to
collect, channel, separate and dispose of sewage, the
Washington-based institution said in an e-mail. A $100 million
loan will go to improve water quality management in communities
of 5,000 to 500,000 inhabitants, the bank said.  The 25-year loans carry a five and a half year grace period
with a variable  interest rate  based on Libor, according to the
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
