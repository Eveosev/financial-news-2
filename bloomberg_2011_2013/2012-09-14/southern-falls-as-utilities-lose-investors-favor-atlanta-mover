Southern Co. (SO) , the second-largest
U.S. power company by market value, fell to its lowest price in
five months as investors lost enthusiasm for utilities.  The utility owner fell 1.9 percent to $45.05 at the close
in New York.  Investors who flocked to regulated utilities such as
Atlanta-based Southern, for their high dividend payout ratios
may now be moving to riskier stocks after the Federal Reserve
announced plans to buy mortgage securities,  Paul Patterson , a
New York-based utilities analyst with Glenrock Associates, said
in a telephone interview.  “You could have some weakness in defensive names like
utilities as investors look for riskier investment options,”
Travis Miller, Chicago-based director of utilities research for
 Morningstar Inc. (MORN) , said in a telephone interview.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Utility Index fell 0.8 percent
amid a worldwide stock rally sparked by news the Fed will expand
holdings of long-term securities with open-ended purchases of
$40 billion of mortgage debt a month.  Investors have soured on utilities in recent weeks as
consumers curb their electricity consumption,  Angie Storozynski ,
a New York-based utilities analyst with Macquarie Capital USA
Inc., wrote in a Sept. 4 note to clients.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Utility Index has declined 3.8
percent since the start of August while the broader index rose
6.6 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
