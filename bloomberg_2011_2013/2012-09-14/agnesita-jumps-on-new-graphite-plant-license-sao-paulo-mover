Magnesita Refratarios SA (MAGG3) , a
Brazilian maker of materials used in steel-making furnaces and
mine operator, jumped after obtaining a license to build a new
graphite plant.  Shares gained 2.8 percent to 7.74 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo. The benchmark Bovespa index added 0.2
percent.  The plant, which is located in the Brazilian state of  Minas
Gerais , will produce as much as 40,000 tons of graphite per
year, Magnesita said in a regulatory filing yesterday after the
market closed.  “The graphite market is expected to remain tight over the
next few years, given the strong demand potential and limited
capacity additions,” Marcos Assumpcao and Andre Pinheiro,
analysts at investment bank Itau BBA, wrote in a note to clients
dated yesterday. The analysts estimate the project can generate
as much as 300 million reais ($148.8 million) for Magnesita,
which is about 15 percent of the company’s market value.  Magnesita gained 34 percent this year, while the Bovespa
rose 9.4 percent during the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
