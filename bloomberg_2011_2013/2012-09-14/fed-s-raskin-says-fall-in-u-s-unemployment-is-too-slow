Federal Reserve Governor  Sarah Bloom Raskin  said the U.S.  unemployment rate  in recent years has
fallen at a “disappointingly slow pace.”  “Most unemployment has been cyclical,” or related to the
performance of the economy, while “there is a structural
element” to the jobless rate as well, Raskin said today at a
conference in Philadelphia.  The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee announced
a new round of stimulus yesterday, pledging to buy mortgage
bonds until officials sees “sustained improvement” in the job
market. The central bank also said it will probably keep near-
zero interest rates through at least mid-2015, compared with an
earlier expectation of late 2014.  The unemployment rate -- at 8.1 percent in August -- has
been stuck above 8 percent since February 2009, when the nation
was mired in a recession.  Raskin spoke at the National Conference on Citizenship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
