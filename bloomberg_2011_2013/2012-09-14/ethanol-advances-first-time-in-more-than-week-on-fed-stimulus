Ethanol advanced for the first time
in more than a week after the  Federal Reserve  announced measures
to help stimulate the world’s largest economy.  Prices rose with other commodities after the Fed said
yesterday it would make additional purchases of debt in a third
round of so-called quantitative easing. Separately, unrest in
the  Middle East  and North Africa sparked concern that oil
shipments will be disrupted.  “Commodities are up because the Federal Reserve has
committed another act of desperation,” said Peyton Feltus,
president of Randolph Risk Management Inc. in  Dallas . “Of
course the Mideast is all stirred up. You certainly get a boost
to all transportation fuels and that includes ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery rose 0.2 cent to
$2.422 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the first advance
since Sept. 6. Futures have gained 9.9 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol advanced 1 cent to $2.49 a
gallon in  New York , 0.5 cent to $2.415 in Chicago, 1.5 cents to
$2.485 in the U.S. Gulf and 1 cent to $2.57 on the West Coast,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gasoline for October delivery jumped 5.34 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $3.0156 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  The gain in gasoline expanded its  premium  to ethanol to
59.36 cents, the highest since June 15, from 54.22 cents
yesterday, making the biofuel more attractive to blend for
refiners, which stand to pocket the difference between the two.  Corn for December delivery rose 8.25 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $7.82 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
