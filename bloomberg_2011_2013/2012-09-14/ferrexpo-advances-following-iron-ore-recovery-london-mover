Ferrexpo Plc (FXPO)  was the second-biggest
gainer in the FTSE 350 Index, outpacing most other mining stocks
as its  iron-ore  focus saw it benefit from a rebound in prices.  Ferrexpo, a miner of the steelmaking material in Ukraine,
climbed 15 percent to 225 pence at the close in London, after
iron ore recovered from a three-year low.  The company, based in Baar,  Switzerland , plans to invest as
much as $1.5 billion to double iron-ore output to 20 million
metric tons a year by 2016 as demand rises. Its concentration on
iron ore has allowed it to outperform more diversified peers,
underpinning a 53 percent gain in the stock since Sept. 5.  Iron ore has climbed 8 percent this week, trading at $96.10
a ton yesterday, according to data from The Steel Index. Prices
will probably be supported in coming days on signs of steel-
 price stability  in China, the largest consumer of the material,
Deutsche Bank AG said in a Sept. 7 report.  Aquarius Platinum Ltd. jumped 19 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
