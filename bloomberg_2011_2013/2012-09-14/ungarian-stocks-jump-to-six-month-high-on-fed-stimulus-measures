Mol Nyrt. (MOL) ,  Hungary ’s largest
refiner, led the benchmark equity index to a six month high as
U.S. Federal Reserve stimulus boosted demand for oil and riskier
emerging-market assets.  Mol advanced 8.5 percent to 19,040 forint for a 10 percent
gain this week. The BUX stock  index  jumped 4 percent to
19,112.34, the highest level since March 23 and increasing this
week’s gains to 4.8 percent, the most since January.  OTP Bank
Nyrt. (OTP) , the country’s biggest lender, rose 3.5 percent to a
seven-month high of 4,088 forint.  Emerging-market stocks jumped the most in 11 months and oil
hit $100 for the first time in four months after the Fed said it
will expand holdings of long-term securities with open-ended
purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt a month and hold the
federal funds rate near zero “at least through mid-2015.”  “Markets got what they wanted, the printing press is on,”
 Akos Kuti , a Budapest-based analyst at broker Equilor
Befektetesi Zrt., wrote in an e-mailed report today. “Fresh
money can now head toward riskier assets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
