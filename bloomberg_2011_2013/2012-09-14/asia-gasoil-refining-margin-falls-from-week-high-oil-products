Asia  refining profits from gasoil
fell from the highest level in a week. The  fuel-oil  crack
widened for a second week, signaling bigger losses for refiners
making the residue.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s  premium  to Dubai crude fell 65 cents to $18.40 a
barrel at 10:12 a.m. Singapore time, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread, a measure of
the profit from making the fuel, was at $19.05 yesterday, the
widest since Sept. 4.  Gasoil swaps for October rose 5 cents to $132 a barrel, PVM
data showed. Prices have gained 1.7 percent so far this week.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil fell 5 cents to $1.25, PVM
data showed. This spread, or the  regrade , has decreased 29
percent from a week earlier, signaling it is less profitable to
make  aviation fuel .  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened 15
cents to $3.40 a barrel, PVM data showed. The crack spread is
set to worsen for the second week.  Fuel-oil swaps  for October jumped $3.50, or 0.5 percent, to
$699.75 a metric ton, according to PVM data. The premium of 180-
centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade, was at $14.50 a ton
today. This  viscosity spread  has increased in five of the past
six weeks, signaling that prices of the less-viscous grade used
in power stations have risen faster than bunker fuel.  Light Distillates  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures increased $5.73, or 6 percent, to $101 a ton, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread has declined 11
percent this week.  Naphtha swaps for October rose $4, or 0.4 percent, to $980
a ton, PVM data showed.  In  Singapore , gasoline’s premium to naphtha gained 11
percent to $17.34 a barrel yesterday, the biggest increase since
Sept. 7, Bloomberg data showed. A wider  reforming margin  means
it is more profitable to make motor fuel instead of naphtha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
