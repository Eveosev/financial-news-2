Asian  stocks  gained this week, with
the regional benchmark index posting its biggest weekly advance
since December, after the  Federal Reserve  said it will buy
mortgage-backed securities to bolster economic growth.  Sony Corp., Japan’s biggest electronics exporter, climbed
8.3 percent in  Tokyo .  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest
mining company and Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, increased 4.2
percent in Sydney as commodities gained. Fraser & Neave Ltd.
rose 7 percent to a record high in  Singapore  after Thai
billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi offered to buy the rest of
the developer and brewer for S$9 billion ($7.4 billion).  “The Fed move has provided the market a shot in the arm,”
said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of investment strategy at
AMP Capital Investors Ltd., oversees about $124 billion. “This
should help keep  mortgage rates  low and boost the housing sector.
While there are still constraints to U.S. growth, the Fed has
pledged to keep stimulating the economy until the labor market
improves.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 3.8 percent this week
to 123.60, the most since the period ended Dec. 2. It rose 5
percent through yesterday this quarter amid speculation U.S.,
 China  and  Europe  will step up efforts to support economic growth.
The Asian benchmark traded at 12.8 times estimated earnings,
compared with 14.2 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 12.3
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Combating Slowdown  South Korea’s  Kospi index  gained 4 percent as data showed
the nation’s exports and imports increased in August from July
and brokerages surged.  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 3.2
percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 advanced 1.5 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 4.2 percent, while
China’s Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.2 percent amid warnings
that investors shouldn’t expect the same sort of massive
stimulus that accompanied the last economic downturn in 2008.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index yesterday rallied to its
highest close since May 4 after the Fed said on Sept. 13 it will
conduct open-ended purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt a
month and pledged to keep federal fund rates near zero “at
least through mid-2015.”  “The Fed’s statement made clear that this monetary easing
will go on until employment growth is satisfactory,” said  Akio Yoshino , chief economist in Tokyo at Amundi Japan Ltd., whose
global parent has $897 billion of assets under management.
“This time around we have a clear link between the economy and
monetary policy, and that’s a very big thing. It should give
powerful support for markets to appreciate.”  Exporters to the U.S. climbed for the week. Sony increased
8.3 percent to 983 yen in Tokyo.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , the
building materials supplier that counts the U.S. as its biggest
market, gained 3.5 percent to A$8.95 in Sydney. Li & Fung Ltd.,
the supplier of clothes and toys to retailers including Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., rose 5.9 percent to HK$12.88 in  Hong Kong .  Euro Bailout  Companies that do business in Europe rose after Germany’s
Federal Constitutional Court cleared the way for a permanent
euro-area bailout fund.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s largest camera
maker, added 7.5 percent to 2,783 yen in Tokyo. HSBC Holdings
Plc, Europe’s biggest lender, gained 5.5 percent to HK$72.70.  Suppliers to  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  rallied after the world’s most
valuable company unveiled its iPhone 5 on Sept. 12. Samsung
Electronics Co., which makes chips for the iPhone and iPad,
climbed 6.9 percent to 1.336 million won in  Seoul . TDK Corp., a
battery supplier to Apple, jumped 7.3 percent to 3,080 yen in
Tokyo. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., which counts Apple as its
biggest customer, advanced 9 percent to NT$97 in Taipei.  Materials Surge  Raw material producers and energy companies posted the
 biggest advance  among the 10 industry groups in the  MSCI Asia
Pacific Index (MXAP)  this week. Commodities had the longest run of
weekly gains since 2010 as the Fed announced a third round
quantitative easing and Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  signaled
China can add stimulus to meet growth targets.  BHP rose 4.2 percent to A$33.31 in Sydney. Sumitomo Metal
Mining Co., Japan’s top gold producer, surged 20 percent to
1,010 yen. Cnooc Ltd., China’s biggest offshore oil producer,
jumped 8.9 percent to HK$15.66.  Massive stimulus measures would hurt China’s long-term
growth and the government’s hesitation in making “bold moves”
to support the economy is pragmatic, the official Xinhua News
Agency wrote in a commentary.  South Korean construction companies advanced after the
government announced on Sept. 10 temporary tax cuts to boost the
housing market. Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co., the
country’s biggest builder, rose 7.6 percent to 70,900 won. GS
Engineering & Construction Corp. added 11 percent 82,500 won.  Korean Banks  Lenders also gained in Seoul after  Standard & Poor’s

moves by  Fitch Ratings  and Moody’s Investors Service. Woori
Finance Holdings Co., the nation’s biggest financial group by
assets, gained 4.9 percent to 11,800 won. Hana Financial Group
Inc. added 3.4 percent to 36,450 won. KB Financial Group Inc.
Jumped 5.9 percent to 40,500 won.  Fraser & Neave gained 7 percent to a record high of S$ 8.97,
as investors speculated the Singapore-based company may attract
a bid higher than the S$8.88 per share offered by Charoen’s TCC
Assets Ltd.  Fisher & Paykel Appliances Holdings Ltd. surged 57 percent
to NZ$1.175 after Haier Group Corp, China’s biggest appliance
maker, offered to buy the rest of the New Zealand-based
refrigerator maker for NZ$695 million ($580 million), or NZ$1.20
a share.  Among stocks that fell, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. plunged
9.7 percent to A$2.99 in Sydney. Australia’s third-largest iron
ore producer said on Sept. 13 it’s in talks with lenders for
potential changes to debt terms as loan covenants are put under
pressure by extended volatility in the metals market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
