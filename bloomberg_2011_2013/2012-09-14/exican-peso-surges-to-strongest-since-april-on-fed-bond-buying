Mexico ’s peso climbed to a five-
month high amid growing optimism the Latin American nation will
benefit from further Federal Reserve stimulus in the U.S.  The peso advanced 0.8 percent to 12.7149 per U.S. dollar at
4 p.m. in Mexico City, after earlier touching 12.7090 per
dollar, the strongest intraday level since April 3. The currency
has gained 2.1 percent this week.  The Fed pledged yesterday to buy bonds until the world’s
largest economy recovers and said it would keep  interest rates 
near zero at least until mid 2015. Mexico sends about 80 percent
of its exports to the U.S.  “When London and Asia had a chance to buy the  Mexican peso 
after the news, we saw a continuation” of the currency’s gains,
 Benito Berber , a Latin America strategist at Nomura Holdings
Inc., said by phone from New York. “The tone has remained
positive.”  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 climbed five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point to 5.73 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.50
centavo to 137.52 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
