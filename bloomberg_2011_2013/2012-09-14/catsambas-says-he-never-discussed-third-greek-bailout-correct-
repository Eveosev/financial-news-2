(Corrects spelling of Catsambas’s name in first and second
paragraph of story published yesterday.)  International Monetary Fund
official Thanos Catsambas denied he said  Greece  will need a
third bailout.  “There was never a discussion or reference to a ‘third
bailout program,’” as suggested by media reports earlier today,
Catsambas, an alternate  executive director  at the IMF,
representing Greece, said in a statement issued by the
Washington-based fund today.  He also said he didn’t take a position on Greece’s euro-
area funding partners. He said he never “insisted” that it
should be the euro zone and ECB that fill the rest of Greece’s
financing gap, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
