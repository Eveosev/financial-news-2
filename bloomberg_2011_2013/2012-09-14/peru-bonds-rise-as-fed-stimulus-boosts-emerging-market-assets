Peru’s bonds advanced after the
 Federal Reserve  expanded stimulus measures to shore up the
world’s largest economy, spurring demand for higher-yielding,
emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due in August 2020 fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 4.39 percent at 10:57 a.m. in Lima,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The yield extended
its weekly drop to seven basis points, the most since Aug. 24.
The price increased 0.19 centimo to 122.68 centimos per sol
today.  “A new round of quantitative easing increases demand for
riskier assets and opens the door to stronger appreciation in
the sol,” said  Roberto Flores , the head of research at Inteligo
SAB. “With that, the appetite for local currency bonds has
grown.”  The sol was little changed at 2.5965 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The currency earlier
touched 2.5960, the strongest level since 1997,  data  from Peru’s
financial regulator show.  The Fed announced a third round of asset purchases known as
quantitative easing yesterday, pledging for the first time that
it will buy bonds until the economy recovers and keep the
benchmark  interest rate  near zero until at least mid-2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
