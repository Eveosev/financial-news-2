Bank of Montreal , Canada’s fourth-
largest lender by assets, is cutting an additional 200 U.S. jobs
as it integrates its C$4.1 billion ($4.2 billion) takeover of
Marshall & Ilsley Corp.  The lender’s Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank eliminated 74
Wisconsin jobs at a  data center  in Cedarburg and a mortgage
underwriting office in Sun Prairie as part of reductions taking
place in the next five months, according to Jim Kappel, a
company spokesman. The other positions being eliminated are
mostly overlapping corporate functions, Kappel said.  The cuts come about three months after the bank said it
would close 24 U.S. branches, affecting 130 workers.  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  bought M&I in July 2011, the largest
acquisition in the Toronto-based lender’s history, to double its
U.S. deposits and branches.  The job cuts were reported earlier today by American
Banker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
