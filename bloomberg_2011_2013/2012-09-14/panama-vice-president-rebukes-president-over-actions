Panama ’s vice president rebuked the
nation’s president, Ricardo Martinelli, for allegedly
consolidating state resources for political gain, widening a
rift between the leaders.  “We do not agree with the president’s attempt to
concentrate political power in the hands of the executive,”
Vice President Juan Carlos Varela said today at a conference in
Washington.  Varela has called on Martinelli to suspend a $250 million
contract to buy radar equipment and helicopters from Italy,
pending an investigation into allegations that officials took
bribes. Martinelli on May 9 called on Varela to resign.  President  Barack Obama  on Oct. 21 signed a free-trade
agreement with Panama, which hasn’t been implemented, according
to the U.S. Trade Representative’s office.  To contact the reporters on this story:
