Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees  de
Jager  said  Greece  may get extra time to meet the conditions
under its rescue program, not more money from European
authorities.  The Netherlands has not changed its position on this issue,
De Jager said in an interview with  Bloomberg News  in Nicosia.  “More time to reduce the deficit has always been the
position of the Netherlands, but more money is not needed if
they will take the measures timely,” De Jager said. “There is
no movement whatsoever this weekend on that topic. No more
openness or so. The situation is the same. Greece has to do
everything the troika asks.”  De Jager said the EU could give Greece the same kinds of
extensions it granted Portugal. He said European authorities are
willing to relax timelines if economic conditions warrant.  “Portugal has been granted an extra year time line, but
they did not ask for any more money from the European side,” De
Jager said. “What happens is that you do not delay your
measures but because of external factors you are reaching your
deficit target somewhat later than first planned. That is not
such a problem for us.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
