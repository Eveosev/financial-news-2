Energias de Portugal SA  is selling
the country’s first corporate bonds since January 2011 as
companies in the euro-region periphery issue at the fastest pace
in more than a year.  EDP, Portugal’s biggest utility, is selling 750 million
euros ($978 million) of five-year senior unsecured bonds,
according to a person with knowledge of the sale. It’s the
country’s first corporate offering since  Portugal Telecom SGPS
SA (PTC)  sold 600 million euros of five-year bonds in January 2011,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Companies from Spanish oil producer Repsol SA to  Telecom
Italia SpA (TIT)  sold more than 16.3 billion euros of bonds this month
in the busiest two weeks for peripheral sales since March 2011.
Borrowers are tapping record-low yields in a wave of optimism
spurred by Germany’s ratification of the euro-area bailout fund
and bond-buying programs from the European Central Bank
President and the  Federal Reserve .  “I think Portugal Telecom could also issue a bond in due
course, there are only a few large Portuguese companies that
issue bonds,” said Normen Fritz, a  fund manager  at Union
Investment Privatfonds in  Frankfurt .   European corporate bond yields have plunged to 2.54 percent
from 4.4 percent at the start of the year, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch’s EMU Corporates index. The extra yield
investors demand to buy company bonds instead of benchmark
German government debt fell 122 basis points this year to 179,
the smallest spread since July 2011.  EDP’s new notes will be priced to yield 5.875 percent, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information is private.  Rui Cabrita, a spokesman for EDP in Lisbon, didn’t respond
to e-mail and phone requests for comment.  The Lisbon-based utility’s existing 4.75 percent bonds due
2016 fell 0.35 cent to 97.78 cents on the euro to yield 5.38
percent. The yield spread on the notes widened 10 basis points
to 507.  To contact the reporter on this story:
