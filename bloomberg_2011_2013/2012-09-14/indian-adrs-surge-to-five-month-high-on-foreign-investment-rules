Indian shares  traded in  New York 
gained to the highest level in five months and  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) 
surged the most since June after the Indian government approved
measures to open up foreign direct investment in the retail and
aviation sectors.  The  Bank of New York Mellon India ADR Index  climbed 3.4
percent to 1,037.36 by 12:02 p.m. in New York, the highest since
April 12. ICICI, the biggest private lender, and  Tata Motors
Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, led gains.  India  ended a ban on local airlines selling stakes to
overseas carriers, opening a new possible source of funding for
operators struggling to turn rising travel demand into profits.
The government also allowed overseas retailers like  Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. (WMT)  and  Carrefour SA (CA)  to own 51 percent of supermarket
chains, a move shelved last year after alliance partners
threatened to revolt.  “The positive moves by the Indian government on reforms
and the easing of financial conditions globally are the main
reasons responsible for this gain,” Walter Rossini, a  fund
manager  with Aletti Gestielle SGR SpA, said by phone from Milan.
“The real issue is not the announcement but the implementation
of this policy. We have seen this noise in the past but maybe
this time it is different.”  ICICI (IBN)  Bank gained 6.3 percent to $38.66 in New York, the
highest since Feb 21.  Tata Motors (TTM)  increased 5.9 percent, the
most in three months, to $25.38.  Sterlite Industries India Ltd. (SLT) 
surged the most since January, jumping 8 percent to $7.70.  The iPath MSCI India Index ETN, an exchange-traded note
that tracks India’s equity market, gained 3.8 percent to $56.46,
the highest since April 12. India’s benchmark BSE India
 Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 2.5 percent to 18,464.27, its
highest close since July 26, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
