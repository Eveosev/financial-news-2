BWT AG (BWT) , an Austrian maker of water-
purification equipment, said the private trust controlled by
Chief Executive Officer Andreas Weissenbacher is making a
mandatory takeover offer that values the company at 285 million
euros ($371 million).  The WAB Privatstiftung trust along with affiliated
companies owns 28.2 percent of shares, which corresponds with
more than 30 percent of  voting rights  and therefore triggers the
offer, the Mondsee, Austria-based company said today in a
statement.  The offer price will be 16 euros a share, a 14 percent
premium over yesterday’s close. BWT  rose  14 percent to 16 euros
at the 5:30 p.m. close of Vienna trading, its highest level
since August 2011 and the most since August 2009. BWT has
advanced 23 percent this year.  BWT, which stands for “best water technology,” was
founded in 1823 and has been listed on the Vienna Exchange since
1992. Its water equipment, primarily for homes and hotels,
treats everything from drinking to swimming pool water.  CEO Weissenbacher, who also owns a 37 percent stake in  WMF
Wuerttembergische Metallwarenfabrik AG (WMF) , a German maker of hotel
coffee machines and kitchen utensils, told Austria Press Agency
today that he didn’t plan to delist the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
