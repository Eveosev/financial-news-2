OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (MNOD) ,  Russia ’s
largest producer of the metal, agreed to buy $4 billion worth of
shares in its Norilsk Nickel Investments unit from another
subsidiary with a view to canceling the stake.  Norilsk will acquire the stock from its Corbiere Holdings
unit by offsetting Corbiere’s debt to the same value, the
company said today in statements on its  website . Both units hold
treasury shares in Norilsk and the transaction is needed to
cancel a portion of those shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
