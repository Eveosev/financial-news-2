Oil production  from the  North
Dakota  portion of the Bakken shale formation topped 600,000
barrels a day for the first time in July, up 69 percent from a
year earlier.  North Dakota’s Bakken output was 609,580 barrels a day in
July, according to the state Industrial Commission. That
compares with 598,510 barrels a day in June and 360,820 barrels
in July 2011.  “It’s amazing how quickly production has grown, and it’s
still in its early stages,” Christian O’Neill, a Bloomberg
Industries senior analyst for oil and gas based in Skillman,  New
Jersey , said in a telephone interview. “Completion techniques
are improving, and the time to drill wells is getting shorter
and shorter. This is the beginning of an oil renaissance in
 North America .”  Increased production out of the Bakken, the Eagle Ford
formation in southern Texas and the Permian Basin in western
Texas helped  U.S. oil output  rise to the highest level in 13
years in July, weekly Energy Department data show.  The U.S. met 83 percent of its energy demand from domestic
sources in the first five months of this year, heading for the
highest annual level since 1991, according to department figures
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Bakken stretches into  South Dakota , Montana and
Saskatchewan, but the majority of production comes from North
Dakota, O’Neill said.  Bakken oil  on the  spot market  rose $1.25 to $103.81 a
barrel at 11:03 a.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Its  premium  to West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, surged to $6.50 a barrel on Sept. 10, the
highest level in almost a year, as refineries on the East and
West coasts gained more access to it through rail shipments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
