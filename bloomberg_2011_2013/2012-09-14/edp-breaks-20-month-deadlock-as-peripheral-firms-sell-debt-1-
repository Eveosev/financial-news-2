Energias de Portugal SA  sold the
country’s first benchmark corporate bonds since January 2011 as
companies in the euro-region periphery issue at the fastest pace
in a year and a half.  Portugal’s biggest utility raised 750 million euros ($978
million) from five-year bonds after receiving orders worth 7.5
billion euros for the notes, according to Chief Financial
Officer Antonio Mexia. Issuance across Europe surged this week
with Renault SA and  Spain ’s  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  helping push sales to
as much as 12.7 billion euros on Sept. 10, the busiest day of
offerings since January 2010.  Borrowers are tapping record-low yields in a wave of
optimism spurred by  Germany ’s ratification of the euro-area
bailout fund and bond-buying programs from the  European Central
Bank  and the  Federal Reserve . Companies such as Spanish oil
producer Repsol SA and  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  sold more than 16.3
billion euros of peripheral bonds this month in the busiest two
weeks for sales of the debt since March 2011.  “The ECB love-in has filtered its way through to the rest
of the periphery,” said Harpreet Parhar, a strategist at Credit
Agricole SA in  London . “ Portugal  has been quietly getting on
with its business and from a fundamental perspective EDP is a
good business, so it’s not surprising to see it go first.”  Crisis Eases  The easing of Europe’s debt crisis that’s roiled markets
for more than two years pushed European corporate bond yields
down to 2.54 percent from 4.4 percent at the start of the year,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s EMU Corporates
index. The yield premium to benchmark German debt fell 122 basis
points this year to 179, the smallest gap since July 2011.  The spread on Iberdrola’s 750 million euros of 4.5 percent
five-year bonds narrowed 72 basis points to 342 basis points
since the securities were sold on Sept. 10, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Repsol’s 750 million euros of 4.375 percent bonds due
February 2018 yield 343 basis points more than German government
debt, 37 basis points less than the Sept. 13 issue spread.  “Recent price action has suggested that many funds have
been notably underweight these names as these new peripheral
bonds have been tightening considerably in the secondary
market,” Credit Suisse credit strategists led by Chiraag Somaia
told clients in a note this week.  EDF, Daimler  The sales from companies in  Europe ’s second-tier nations
come amid a flood of offerings from borrowers across Europe,
including the region’s biggest power generator Electricite de
France SA and carmaker Daimler AG. Issuance reached 46.1 billion
euros this month, Bloomberg data show.  EDP’s bonds were priced to yield 5.875 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show, down from the 6.25 percent area in
initial marketing. It’s the country’s first benchmark corporate
issue since Portugal Telecom SGPS SA sold 600 million euros of
bonds in January 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “This shows the international credibility of EDP and the
improvement of Portugal’s risk,” EDP’s Mexia said in a
telephone interview. “This will open the path for other
Portuguese companies.”  The Lisbon-based utility’s existing 4.75 percent bonds due
2016 reversed an early decline, rising 0.04 cent to 98.16 cents
on the euro to yield 5.27 percent. The yield spread on the notes
narrowed 1 basis point to 497 basis points.  “I think Portugal Telecom could also issue a bond in due
course, there are only a few large Portuguese companies that
issue bonds,” said Normen Fritz, a  fund manager  at Union
Investment Privatfonds in  Frankfurt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
