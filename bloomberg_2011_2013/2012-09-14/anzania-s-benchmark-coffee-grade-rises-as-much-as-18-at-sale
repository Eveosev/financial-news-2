Tanzania ’s benchmark coffee climbed
as much as 18 percent at an auction yesterday after supplies of
the grade dropped and global prices increased, the Tanzania
Coffee Board said.  The benchmark Arabica AA sold for as much as $220 per 50-
kilogram (110-pound) bag from $187 a week earlier, the board
said today by e-mail from Moshi, in northern Tanzania. Supplies
of the grade fell 17 percent to 5,526 bags, it said.  The grade sold for a minimum of $186 a bag from $170 last
week, while the average price climbed to $191.42 from $178.35 a
bag at the previous sale, the agency said.  The U.S.,  Japan  and  Germany  are among the importers of
Tanzania coffee, according to the board. Tanzania reaps its crop
from April through August. Arabica accounts for 75 percent of
the country’s output, while robusta accounts for the rest.  Supplies for all the coffee at the auction climbed 13
percent to 21,915 bags, while sales rose 25 percent to 21,315
bags, the agency said. The board offers its bags in 60-kilogram
packages and costs in 50 kilograms.  Production for the current marketing season in the 12
months through June next year may climb to 61,012 metric tons
from 32,045 tons because of a high-yield crop cycle and good
weather, the board said in May.  The following are details of yesterday’s auction in U.S.
