Mary Nicola , currency strategist at
BNP Paribas SA in New York, commented on dollar weakness
following the  Federal Reserve ’s decision yesterday to conduct
open-ended debt purchases under quantitative easing.  Speaking in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Lunch
Money” with Sara Eisen, Nicola also addressed possible  Bank of
Japan  intervention and currency strength in emerging markets.  On the euro and the dollar:  “We’ve moved away from the focus on the euro. Now the
focus is going to be on dollar weakness going forward.
Positioning shows that investors are basically neutral on the
dollar, so there’s plenty of scope for further downside all
across the board.”  On the Bank of Japan:  “The stakes are raised for the BOJ meeting next week.
There’s going to be a lot of speculation that we could see some
sort of reaction from the BOJ to do something on the monetary
side so they can weaken the yen.”  On  emerging markets :  “Right now, with emerging markets in particular, there’s
going to be some attempt to fight off currency strength because
the economies right now aren’t in the same position they were
back in 2010.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
