Japan   stocks  rose, with the  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average reaching a three-week high, after the  Federal
Reserve  said it will buy mortgage-backed securities to boost
growth in the world’s biggest economy.  Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets 27 percent of sales in
the Americas, rose 3.6 percent.  Sumitomo Metal Mining Ltd. (5713) ,
Japan’s biggest gold producer, led gains on the Nikkei 225 as
bullion and copper jumped after the Fed’s announcement. Seven &
I Holdings Ltd. fell 2.4 percent on a Nikkei newspaper report
that the convenient-store operator will miss its operating
profit forecast.  The Nikkei 225 gained 1.8 percent to 9,159.39 at the 3 p.m.
close of trading in  Tokyo , bringing this week’s advance to 3.2
percent. Nikkei 225 futures and options contracts for September
delivery, also known as the “special quotation,” settled at
9,076.79. The broader  Topix Index (TPX)  climbed 1.7 percent to 756.88,
with volume and trading value rising the most since March.  “It’s a fantastic time to be investing in the Japanese
markets,”  Ed Rogers , chief executive officer at Tokyo-based
Rogers Investment Advisors, which invests in funds of  hedge
funds , said in a Bloomberg TV interview with Zeb Eckert. “For
Japan it means as soon as the U.S. can help repair the finances
of consumers, the better it is for Japan.”  The Topix dropped 13 percent from this year’s peak on March
27 on concern Europe’s debt crisis is deepening and as growth
slows in China and the U.S. The gauge trades at 0.9 times book
value, compared with 2.3 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
1.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. A number below one means
companies can be bought for less than the value of their assets.  Economic Assessment  Shares gained even after the government said Japan’s
recovery from last year’s record earthquake may be stalling amid
the global slowdown, according to a monthly economic assessment
released by the Cabinet Office today. The report cited a second
month of falling personal consumption and industrial output, and
cut its outlook for  capital spending  and earnings going forward.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.2
percent today. The index jumped 1.6 percent in  New York 
yesterday to its highest close since the end of 2007, after the
Fed said it will conduct open-ended purchases of $40 billion of
mortgage debt a month to help fight unemployment stuck at 8
percent since February 2009.  The central bank will continue buying mortgage-backed
securities and undertake other asset purchases if the outlook
for the labor market doesn’t improve substantially, the  Federal
Open Market Committee  said yesterday. It also said it would
probably hold the federal funds rate near zero “at least
through mid-2015.”  Canon gained 3.6 percent to 2,783 yen.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a
construction-equipment maker that gets 23 percent of sales in
the Americas, climbed 4.5 percent to 1,681 yen.  Yen’s Rise  Japan’s Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  said the government is
ready to take “decisive” action against unacceptable swings in
the yen’s value after the currency strengthened to a seven-month
high against the dollar following the Fed’s announcement.  Commodities climbed after on speculation the added U.S.
stimulus will boost demand. Gold rose to its highest level since
February, while copper jumped as much as 3.5 percent on the
London Metal Exchange, the highest since May 2. Crude also rose
to a four-month high, with futures rising 0.8 percent in New
York to erase declines for the year.  Sumitomo Metal Mining rose 9.4 percent to 1,010 yen, the
biggest gain since 2009. Inpex Corp., Japan’s biggest oil
explorer, surged 5.9 percent to 485,000 yen.  Among declining shares, Seven & I lost 2.4 percent to 2,323
yen. The Nikkei reported the company is expected to post first-
half operating profit of 147 billion yen, a 2 percent decline
from a year earlier.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  declined 1.8
percent to 18.93, indicating that traders expect a swing of
about 5.4 percent over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
