The 40 richest people on Earth
added a combined $29.5 billion to their collective net worth
this week as global stocks soared.  The biggest gainer was Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal,
according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His fortune
soared $2.2 billion after shares of his Riyadh-based  Kingdom
Holding Co. (KINGDOM)  rose 17.6 percent. The company announced plans to
renovate the Four Seasons George V hotel in Paris.  “People took some heart from the seriousness of the
central bankers in their efforts to come to grips with this
period of very slow economic growth,”  John Carey , who helps
oversee about $220 billion at Pioneer Investment Management
Inc., said in a telephone interview from his Boston office.
“We’ll see what happens next.”  Stocks rallied during the week after Germany’s top
constitutional court rejected efforts to block a permanent euro-
area rescue fund, a 500 billion-euro ($655 billion) bailout
facility, on Sept. 11. The market also surged when the Federal
Reserve announced it would expand its holdings of long-term
securities by buying $40 billion of mortgage debt a month, and
said it would hold the federal funds rate near zero until at
least the middle of 2015.  The S&P 500 gained 1.94 percent during the week to close at
1465.77 in New York, its highest level since December 2007. The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 1.34 percent, closing at 275.95.  Slim, Gates  Carlos Slim , 72, remains the world’s richest person. Slim’s
fortune rose $1.6 billion as shares of his Mexico City-based
holding company Grupo Financiero Inbursa SAB leapt 2.65 percent.
His net worth is $75.8 billion, the highest it’s been since the
index started tracking the world’s wealthiest individuals in
March.  The fortune of Bill Gates, 56, the world’s second-richest
person, also reached a recent high. The Microsoft co-founder
gained $1.2 billion after reports that the company may announce
a 15 percent increase to its quarterly dividend later this
month. Gates is worth $65.1 billion.  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  chairman  Warren Buffett  has a net
worth of $47.5 billion. The 82-year-old said yesterday that he
completed his last prostate-cancer radiation treatment. Buffett
ranks fourth in the world. Berkshire shares rose 2.35 percent
during the week.  Europe’s Richest  Amancio Ortega, the 76-year-old founder of Zara clothing
chain owner  Inditex SA (ITX) , remains Europe’s richest man, $1.5
billion ahead of Buffett. The Spaniard’s fortune rose $1.3
billion as shares of Inditex, the world’s largest clothing
retailer, gained 0.4 percent.  In Europe, Ortega is ahead of Swedish billionaires  Ingvar
Kamprad , the founder of the IKEA furniture chain, and Stefan
Persson, the chairman of clothing retailer  Hennes & Mauritz AB. (HMB)   Asia’s richest man, 84-year-old  Li Ka-Shing , ranks 13th on
the index with a net worth of $26.8 billion. Shares of the
billionaire’s  Cheung Kong Holdings (1)  Ltd. rose 5.65 percent in
Hong Kong.  The Bloomberg Billionaires Index takes measure of the
world’s wealthiest people based on market and economic changes
