Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  jumped the most
in almost eight months, leading the Czech  stock index  to its
highest in almost six months after the U.S. Federal Reserve
pledged to keep stimulating the world’s largest economy.  The Austrian lender’s shares rose 7.5 percent to 469 koruna
by 2:27 p.m. in  Prague , their steepest intraday advance since
Jan. 26. The  PX (PX)  gauge, where Erste has a 23 percent weighting,
added 2.3 percent, heading for its highest close since March 28.  Stocks and commodities surged around the world after the
Fed said it will expand holdings of long-term bonds with open-
ended purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt a month and hold
the federal funds rate near zero until at least the middle of
2015, boosting investors’ demand for riskier assets.  “The market has been surprised by both the volume of the
intervention and its basically unlimited duration,” Miroslav Adamkovic, a stock analyst at  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  in Prague, wrote
in an e-mailed report to clients today.  New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest Czech producer of
coking coal, climbed 4.8 percent to 92.75 koruna, headed for its
biggest rally in three months. More than 1.3 million shares have
changed hands so far today, almost seven times the three-month
daily average and the biggest turnover in the PX index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
