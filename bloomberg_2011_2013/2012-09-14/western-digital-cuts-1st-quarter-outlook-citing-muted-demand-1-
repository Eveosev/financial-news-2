Western Digital Corp. (WDC) , the largest
maker of hard-disk drives, cut its forecasts for sales and
market size in the current quarter, citing muted demand for
personal computers.  Revenue will be $3.9 billion to $4 billion in the three
months that end Sept. 28, Irvine, California-based Western
Digital said yesterday in a statement. That’s down from an
earlier projection for sales of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion and
compares with an average analyst estimate of $4.28 billion,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Western Digital’s revision adds to evidence that demand for
personal computers and components is faltering in a period when
it normally grows, as manufacturers build machines in
preparation for year-end holiday sales. The announcement follows
forecast reductions by  Seagate Technology Plc (STX)  in July and  Intel
Corp. (INTC)  last week.  The total available market for hard drives will be 140
million units, rather than 157 million, as previously projected,
Western Digital said.  Shares fell 1.7 percent in extended trading yesterday after
the announcement. The stock had earlier gained 2.7 percent to
$42.58 at the close in  New York , leaving it up 38 percent this
year.  The company said it will pay a quarterly dividend of 25
cents a share, payable on Oct. 15 to shareholders of record on
Sept. 28. It also added $1.5 billion to a share buyback program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
