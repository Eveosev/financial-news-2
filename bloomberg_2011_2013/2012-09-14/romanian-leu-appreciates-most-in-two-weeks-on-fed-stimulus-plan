Romania ’s leu strengthened the most
in two weeks and foreign bond yields dropped after the  Federal
Reserve ’s plan to buy bonds until the U.S. job market recovers
pushed up appetite for riskier assets.  The leu rose as much as 0.5 percent, the most since Aug.
30, to 4.4895 per euro, before paring its gain to 0.3 percent to
4.4990 per euro by 5:14 p.m. in Bucharest, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on Romania’s euro-denominated
bonds due 2018 dropped about 8 basis points to 4.735 percent.  Emerging-market currencies, including the Polish zloty and
the Czech koruna in Europe’s east, and stocks rallied after the
Fed said yesterday it will expand holdings of long-term
securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of mortgage
debt a month and hold the federal funds rate near zero “at
least through mid-2015.”  “Emerging  Europe ’s currencies opened stronger on Friday
morning supported by global investors’ improved sentiment. The
Romanian leu opened at 4.5010 per euro and traded in the 4.4891
- 4.5050 per euro area,” Piraeus Bank Romania SA economists,
including Camil Apostol, wrote in a note to clients today. “We
think the leu will close the session in the same area.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
