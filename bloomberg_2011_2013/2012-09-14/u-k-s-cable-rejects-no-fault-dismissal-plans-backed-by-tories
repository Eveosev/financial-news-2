U.K. Business Secretary  Vince Cable 
rejected a proposal, backed by some Conservatives, to allow very
small businesses to fire staff without giving reasons, as he
announced a simplification of employment law.  The idea of “no-fault” dismissal was proposed by Apax
Partners Worldwide LLP’s Adrian Beecroft, in a report
commissioned by Prime Minister  David Cameron . It would have
allowed employers to pay off staff without justifying their
dismissal, as they currently have to do. Beecroft argued it
would give businesses the confidence to hire.  Cable, a Liberal Democrat member of Cameron’s coalition
government, said such a move would have risked further
undermining confidence, hurting an economy struggling to emerge
from a double-dip recession. Lawmakers from Cameron’s
 Conservative Party  said it was the sort of “supply-side”
measure needed to spur growth.  “We want to have confidence in business that they can hire
people, but we want people to go to work knowing that at the end
of the day, if they have a very bad relationship, they do have
some basic labor rights and protection,” Cable told ITV today.  Instead, he announced a streamlining of the process by
which employees can seek redress if they argue they’ve been
wrongly dismissed. The cap on compensation may be reduced from
its current level of 72,300 pounds ($117,000) and it will be
easier for judges to dismiss weak claims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
