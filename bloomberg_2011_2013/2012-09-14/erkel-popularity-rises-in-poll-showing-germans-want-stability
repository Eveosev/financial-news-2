Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s approval
rating rose as the euro debt crisis eased, with a poll
suggesting Germans would prefer her to lead the next government
without her current Free Democratic Party coalition ally.  Merkel widened her lead as  Germany ’s most popular
politician over second-place Hannelore Kraft, the Social
Democratic state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia state, whose
approval rating was unchanged compared with the last poll on
Aug. 24, according the survey for ZDF television published
today. Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  remained third.  Voter support for Merkel’s Christian Democratic bloc and
the Free Democrats declined by one percentage point each to a
combined 40 percent, with the FDP dropping to 4 percent, below
the 5 percent threshold for winning seats in parliament. The
Social Democrats rose 1 percentage point to 30 percent and the
Greens gained 1 point to 13 percent.  With elections due in the fall of 2013, the largest number
of respondents, 54 percent, would prefer a coalition of
 Christian Democrats  and Social Democrats, ZDF said in a
statement citing FG Wahlen polling. Merkel headed such a so-
called grand coalition in her first term from 2005 to 2009.  “At a time of crisis, Germans evidently would like a
government with a broad political base,” the statement quoted
Theo Koll, ZDF’s chief political analyst, as saying.  The Sept. 11-13 poll of 1,198 voting-age people has a
margin of error of about three percentage points, ZDF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
