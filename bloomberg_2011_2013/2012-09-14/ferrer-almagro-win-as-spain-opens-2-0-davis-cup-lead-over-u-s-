David Ferrer  and Nicolas Almagro
were winners as defending champion Spain took a 2-0 lead over
the U.S. heading into today’s play in the Davis Cup semifinals.  Ferrer, a semifinalist last week at the U.S. Open, defeated
Sam Querrey 4-6, 6-2, 6-2, 6-4, in the first match on red clay
in Gijon, Spain. Almagro followed with a 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5
victory against John Isner.  Spain is seeking its second consecutive championship, and
fourth in the past five years, at the Davis Cup, the leading
team event in men’s tennis. Spain is playing without  Rafael Nadal , the No. 3 player on the ATP Tour, who is sidelined with a
knee injury.  Play resumes today with the doubles match -- featuring Bob
and  Mike Bryan  of the U.S. against Spain’s Marcel Granollers and
Marc Lopez -- and the third singles match between Isner and
Ferrer. The final match between Querrey and Almagro is scheduled
for tomorrow.  Argentina and the Czech Republic are tied 1-1 in the other
semifinal series on clay in Buenos Aires. Juan Martin Del Potro
gave Argentina a 1-0 lead with a straight-set victory against
Radek Stepanek, and Tomas Berdych evened the score with a five-
set win against  Juan Monaco .  To contact the reporter on this story:
