Taiwan ’s dollar had the biggest
weekly gain since February as a Federal Reserve plan to lift
asset purchases spurred demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency touched the strongest level in four months
after global funds bought $944 million more of the island’s
stocks than they sold this week, taking 2012 net purchases to
$1.5 billion, exchange data show. The Fed said yesterday it will
expand its holdings of long-term securities with open-ended
purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt per month, and hold
the federal funds rate near zero “at least through mid-2015.”  “Confirmation of QE3 yesterday gave the  Taiwan dollar  a
strong boost,” said Tarsicio Tong, a foreign-exchange trader at
 Union Bank of Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. “The rally will probably last
for another day or two, but after the news subsides traders will
look at fundamentals again.”  Taiwan’s dollar rose 1.3 percent this week to NT$29.469
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
advanced 0.8 percent today and touched NT$29.375 earlier, the
strongest level since May 11.  One-month non-deliverable forwards added 1.1 percent to
NT$29.34 against the greenback during the week, a 0.4 percent
premium to the spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts gained 0.8 percent today.  The central bank, which has kept its benchmark rate at
1.875 percent since June 2011, will meet to review borrowing
costs before the end of this month.  Government bonds  declined. The yield on Taiwan’s 1.125
percent notes due September 2022 climbed one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 1.19 percent this week, according to
Gretai Securities Market. It was little changed today. The
overnight money-market rate held at 0.39 percent today and this
week, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money
Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
