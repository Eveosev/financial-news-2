A Canadian man pleaded guilty to
charges he ran a $130 million Ponzi scheme selling fraudulent
certificates of deposit to 1,200 people through banking entities
he controlled, U.S. prosecutors said.  William Wise, a Canadian citizen formerly of Raleigh,  North
Carolina , admitted that from January 2004 to March 2009 he and
others sold more than $129.5 million of bogus CDs to investors,
causing losses of more than $75 million, U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag in San Francisco said today in an e-mailed statement.  Wise pleaded guilty yesterday to 18 counts of conspiracy,
mail and  wire fraud  and  tax evasion , prosecutors said. He is
scheduled for sentencing March 13 in federal court in San
Francisco. He faces as long as 20 years in prison and a fine of
twice the loss for the most serious charges.  Wise surrendered voluntarily, has been in custody since
April and is cooperating with the government to recover funds,
said Paul Wolf, his lawyer.  “He is doing everything he can to make amends and put this
right,” Wolf said today in a phone interview.  The case is U.S. v. Wise, 12-00111, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California ( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
