The president of the  American
Federation of Teachers ,  Randi Weingarten , said in an interview
on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital With  Al Hunt ”
airing this weekend that she is “cautiously optimistic” that a
deal will be reached to end Chicago’s teachers’ strike within a
couple of days.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin the show with Randi Weingarten, president
of the American Federation of Teachers. Thank you so much for
being with us.  RANDI WEINGARTEN: Great to be with you.  HUNT: The news, of course, the Chicago teachers’ strike. Is
this likely to be settled soon, in the next couple of days? Is
it likely to drag out for weeks?  WEINGARTEN: Well, as - as the week turned this week, we
started being cautiously optimistic. I started hearing good
things from both sides, from my union as well as from the
management side, that positive movement had been made at the
table. No one, no one, no one wants a teachers’ strike. We want
to be back in classrooms teaching kids.  HUNT: So you’re cautiously optimistic it’ll be settled in
maybe a couple of days.  WEINGARTEN: In a couple of days. You just don’t know if
there’s going to be another hiccup, but I listen to the music,
not the words. And the music is that there is real - there’s a
real seriousness at the bargaining table about issues that are
really, really important.  HUNT: Let me ask you about some issues. And I know this is
not a prime issue there, but people reading the papers see
Chicago teachers on average make about - a little over $70,000 a
year. That’s - that’s higher - that’s about 50 percent higher
than the average  household income  in Chicago. They say, “Now
wait a minute. In a struggling economy, these - these men and
women are doing pretty well.”  WEINGARTEN: Well, the - the strike is about a bunch of
issues. Most importantly, what we do with public education. It’s
- I - money is on the table. And frankly, it didn’t help that
Rahm Emanuel actually canceled a raise that teachers had -  HUNT: But they’re going to make it up in their contract,
aren’t they?  WEINGARTEN: Well, we’ll - again, I am cautiously
optimistic. But everyone, including the union, understands the
tough financial position that the city is in, and they’ve been
close on the issue of money for several days now. This is the
issue. What do we do to ensure that all kids, not some kids,
have a great public education?  HUNT: One of the big issues is teacher evaluation. And the
union has fought that proposal from the city, and yet as I read,
it is not just a per se evaluation. It is - it is for the
teachers - whether the students show improvement. Why shouldn’t
you expect that of a teacher?  WEINGARTEN: So actually the issue on the table is not
whether there should be an evaluation. That’s already been
decided. It is how you do this. And this is - sorry.  HUNT: But no, but why - why isn’t what  Chicago  is asking,
why isn’t that reasonable? That’s just saying that’s 40 percent
of your evaluation will be whether your students improve in
their scores.  WEINGARTEN: Actually - actually what’s the real issue is
not what the component of “Did my kids learn it?” is, but it’s
how to actually make that a reality. What happening across the
country, Al, is that teacher evaluation, instead of being really
about “Have I taught it and have kids learned it?,” it’s now
being - becoming formulaic. And so the algorithm that pops out
of a black box that Chicago is using or  Tennessee  is using and
things like that, one year a teacher can be effective, the next
year that very same teacher can be ineffective. Now what
happened? What was the difference? The difference is this
mathematical algorithm.  HUNT: Let me ask you about Chicago. There’s a number of
people who have said this is really a clash of personalities out
there and it’s more about Mayor  Rahm Emanuel . Do you agree with
that, and would it be different if Mayor Daley were still there?  WEINGARTEN: Well, I think that Mayor Emanuel did a lot of
poking in the eye that he ought not to have done. He ended up
doing - he ended up taking away a raise, trying to unilaterally
implement some - a longer school day and doing a bunch of -doing
a lot of poking in the eye. What we’re seeing, unfortunately, is
15 years of lots of reform go amok. And I think that what - so
I’m not going to do the kind of compare and contrast between
Daley and Emanuel. But what I am going to say is that I’ve
watched in Chicago people being really frustrated that they
don’t have the tools they need to do their job.  HUNT: But when you say 15 years go amok, that’s a serious
indictment of Barack Obama’s education secretary,  Arne Duncan ,
who ran the Chicago schools. He did a bad job?  WEINGARTEN: I think that this notion of top-down
accountability to the exclusion of teaching and learning, this
notion of being totally fixated on tests, of thinking that
charters are the panacea -  HUNT: Is that Arne Duncan?  WEINGARTEN: Well, it’s - there are a whole bunch of so-
called reformers -  HUNT: And he’s one of them?  WEINGARTEN: - that think these are the silver bullets.  HUNT: And he’s one of them?  WEINGARTEN: And I don’t think that it is - I don’t think
that it is -  HUNT: I’m going to get you to say he’s one of them if
that’s what you think.  WEINGARTEN: I have - I have said very loudly that the -that
we’ve disagreed with aspects of  Barack Obama ’s education policy.
I think their policy, including Arne Duncan’s policy, of being
too fixated on measurements and competition is wrong. Having
said that, there’s a bunch of what they do that’s right. But
what you’re seeing play itself out in Chicago is this fixation
on accountability, top-down sanctions and fear, as opposed to
how you actually do the business of educating all kids.  HUNT: But you earlier sort of took the slap at the charter
schools. There’s a long waiting list for charter schools in
Chicago. Doesn’t that suggest that parents really would like
that option?  WEINGARTEN: What parents want is a safe place for their
kids, and the charter schools are viewed as the darlings by the
city. If you actually look at the - at the results of the
charter schools, they’re wildly uneven, and many of them don’t
do nearly as well as the public schools. Parents - when you
actually talk to parents, what they say is fix, don’t close, our
neighborhood school. But I saw at Carver Elementary School this
week when I was there, I saw some of the teachers were pointing
to the charter school and saying, “They have state-of-the-art
equipment. Our computers don’t work in Carver.”  HUNT: Final question. If this goes on for a while, is this
hurting Barack Obama, two constituencies, unions and school
reformers? Is it hurting his presidential run?  WEINGARTEN: Look, I think that there’s so many issues in
the national election about whose side are you on, whether
you’re for an economy that works for the middle class or whether
people are on their own, that this issue is very localized. It
does have national resonance because of how teachers are
feeling, but I - I think that we need to solve this issue
locally and then get on to doing the work we have to do to re-
elect Barack Obama.  HUNT: Randi Weingarten, thank you. Thank you so much for
being with us.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
