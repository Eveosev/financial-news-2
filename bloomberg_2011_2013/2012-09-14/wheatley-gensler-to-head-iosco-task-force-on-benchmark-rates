The International Organization of
Securities Commissions, which represents regulators in more than
100 countries, started a  task force  to investigate benchmarks
such as Libor after allegations banks rigged the rate.  Financial Services Authority Managing Director Martin Wheatley and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman
 Gary Gensler  will oversee the group, which will develop global
policy guidance and principles for the setting of such rates,
Madrid-based IOSCO said in an e-mailed statement today.  “IOSCO is committed to taking necessary steps to prevent
the manipulation of benchmarks and restore confidence in the use
of those benchmarks in global financial markets,” the group
said. “Doubts about the integrity and accuracy of benchmarks
will undermine market confidence, distort the real economy, and
potentially cause losses to investors and market participants.”  U.S. and European regulators are probing more than a dozen
banks worldwide over allegations they manipulated the London
interbank offered rate as well as its European and Japanese
counterparts. Investigators are examining whether traders
colluded to rig the rates for profit and whether banks
understated their borrowing costs to appear healthier than they
were.  Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s second-biggest lender by assets,
was fined a record 290 million pounds ($470 million) in June for
rigging Libor, the benchmark for more than $300 trillion of
securities worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
