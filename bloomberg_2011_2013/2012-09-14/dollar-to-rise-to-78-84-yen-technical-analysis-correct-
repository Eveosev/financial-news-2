The  U.S. dollar  may rally 1.5
percent within two weeks after it touched a seven-month low
versus the yen, Forecast Pte said, citing trading patterns.  A “long lower shadow” formed on the so-called candle
chart yesterday suggests sellers forced the greenback down
before buyers pushed it back up toward the opening level by the
end of the day, according to Pak Lai Ng, a Singapore-based
technical analyst at Forecast.  “We see a long tail at the bottom of the candle stick
chart,” Ng said. “It would suggest that a dollar rebound is
likely from here.”  The dollar fetched 77.65 yen at 1:21 p.m. in  Tokyo  from
77.49 yesterday, when it touched 77.13, the lowest since Feb. 9.  Should the greenback rise back above the past support level
of 78 yen, it could advance to 78.84 within two weeks, according
to Ng. That would be the highest since Sept. 7.  “The dollar needs to regain the 78 level to confirm a
reversal” of its downward trend, Ng said. “Yesterday we saw
quite a sharp drop in the dollar-yen and further downside is
quite limited from here.”  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
