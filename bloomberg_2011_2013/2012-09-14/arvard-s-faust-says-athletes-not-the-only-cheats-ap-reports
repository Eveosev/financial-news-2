Harvard University  President Drew Faust said athletes shouldn’t be singled out for blame among
students in what is believed to be the largest cheating scandal
in the school’s history, Associated Press reported.  About 125 students may have shared answers in an upper-
level government class called “Introduction to Congress.”  Harvard University’s football team, favored to retain its
Ivy League title in a preseason media poll, could lose some
players this year because of the cheating probe disclosed by the
school last month, according to a person familiar with the
matter,  Bloomberg News  reported Sept. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
