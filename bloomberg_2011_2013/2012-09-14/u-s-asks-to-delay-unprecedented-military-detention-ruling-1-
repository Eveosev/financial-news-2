The U.S. asked a judge to delay
implementation of an order permanently blocking enforcement of a
law that opponents claim may subject them to indefinite military
detention for speech protected by the Constitution.  The Justice Department today asked U.S. District Judge
Katherine Forrest for a stay of the Sept. 12 decision, in a case
challenging a provision of the National Defense Authorization
Act for 2012. In the ruling, Forrest extended a preliminary
injunction against the law that she had entered in May.  Forrest ruled that the law violates rights guaranteed by
the First, Fifth and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.
The government yesterday filed court papers to appeal.  The suit challenging the law was filed Jan. 13 by a group
including former  New York  Times reporter Christopher Hedges. The
plaintiffs claim that Section 1021(b)(2) of the law allows for
detention of citizens and permanent residents taken into custody
in the U.S. on “suspicion of providing substantial support” to
groups engaged in hostilities against the U.S. such as al-Qaeda
and the Taliban.  The case is Hedges v. Obama, 12-cv-00331, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporters on this story:
