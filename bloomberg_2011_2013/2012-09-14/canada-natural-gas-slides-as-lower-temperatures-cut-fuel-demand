Canadian natural gas dropped on
speculation that forecasts for moderate weather will reduce
demand from  power plants .  October gas in Alberta  fell 2.7 percent as MDA EarthSat
Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted below-average
temperatures for most of central  Canada  and the eastern U.S. on
Sept. 19 through Sept. 28. Early October forecasts indicate weak
northern U.S. heating demand,  Tim Evans , a New York-based energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective, said in a note today.  Alberta gas for October delivery dropped 6.5 cents to
C$2.375 per gigajoule ($2.32 per million British thermal units)
as of 12:45 p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  dropped 7.7 cents, or 2.5 percent to $2.96 per million
Btu at 12:49 p.m. The futures are down 0.8 percent this year.  “Peak demand is far off and the supply overhang remains
onerous,”  Mike Fitzpatrick , editor of the Energy OverView
newsletter in New York, said in a note to clients. “Output is
at or near records, keeping the market well supplied and
promising bigger weekly storage builds and renewed concerns
about capacity constraints.  The high in Calgary on Sept. 24 may be 49 degrees
Fahrenheit (9 Celsius), 11 below normal, while Minneapolis may
be 7 below normal at 68 degrees, according to AccuWeather Inc.
in  State College , Pennsylvania.  Cooling Demand  U.S. cooling demand may be 10 percent below normal over the
next 7 days, data show from Weather Derivatives in Belton,
Missouri. Electricity generators account for 36 percent of U.S.
gas demand.  Gas inventories  in the lower 48 states totaled 3.429
trillion cubic feet in the week ended Sept. 7, 9 percent above
the five-year average for the period, the Energy Department said
yesterday. Stockpiles may climb to a  record  3.95 trillion cubic
feet by the end of October, compared with total  storage capacity 
of 4.239 trillion cubic feet as of April, department data show.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.5 billion cubic
feet at 11:30 a.m. New York time, compared with the target of
16.2 billion.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.85 billion cubic feet
at Empress,  Alberta , where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main Line.  Gas Flows  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.97 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s  British Columbia system 
at Kingsgate was 182 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.81 billion cubic feet today. Estimated capacity was
2.02 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.69
