Japanese and Australian stock futures
rose on speculation the  Federal Reserve  may consider another
stimulus program to prevent a recession. Economists say Japan’s
central bank may also take steps to boost its economy.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest camera maker, climbed 0.8 percent from the closing share
price in Tokyo. Those of  Hitachi Ltd. (6501) , Japan’s second-largest
manufacturer by revenue, jumped 4.9 percent after a person
familiar with the matter said the company and  Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd. (7011)  are discussing a merger of some businesses. ADRs
of  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , Australia’s No. 2 lender by market
value, advanced 0.4 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,655 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,650 in  Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,660
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on  Australia ’s S&P/ASX
200 Index gained 0.3 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
advanced 0.5 percent in Wellington.  “If investor sentiment improves because of easing monetary
policies in the U.S., their tolerance for risk will increase,”
said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600 million in Tokyo
at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “Worsening investor
sentiment about the economic outlook has contributed to recent
declines in stocks.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2
percent today. In  New York  yesterday, the index advanced 0.5
percent to 1,260.34, snapping a seven-day decline, amid
speculation the Federal Reserve may consider another economic
stimulus program to prevent a recession.  Bank of Japan  Some economists also say the Bank of Japan will move to
boost economic stimulus at a two-day meeting starting today in
 Tokyo .  U.S. stocks rebounded after the Wall Street Journal
reported three former top officials at the Fed said the central
bank should consider a new round of securities purchases to
bolster economic growth.  The Fed finished its second round of so-called quantitative
easing, nicknamed “QE2” by investors, at the end of June. The
program helped propel a rally of as much as 28 percent in the
S&P 500 since Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke foreshadowed the plan
on Aug. 27.  Stocks in the U.S. fell earlier after a report showed
service industries expanded in July at the slowest pace since
February 2010 as orders and employment cooled, a sign the
biggest part of the  U.S. economy  had little momentum entering
the second half of this year. The Institute for Supply
Management’s index of non-manufacturing businesses dropped to
52.7 last month from 53.3 in June. Readings above 50 signal
expansion.  U.S. Jobs  Companies in the U.S. added 114,000 workers to payrolls in
July, according to figures from ADP Employer Services. The
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called
for an advance of 100,000. The data comes two days before a
government report projected to show an increase of 85,000 jobs.  In  Japan , the Bank of Japan is scheduled to hold a two-day
meeting starting today to discuss  interest rates  and monetary
policy.  Five of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News said the
BOJ will increase monetary stimulus at the meeting, while two
said that may happen and seven forecast no change.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 2.9 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 0.2 percent by the
S&P 500 and a drop of 8.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.6 times for the S&P 500
and 10.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  Merger Talks  Hitachi and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries agreed to discuss a
merger of some business, including infrastructure, a person
familiar with the matter said, confirming a Nikkei newspaper
report. The companies plan to announce details today, the person
said.  Hitachi, based in Tokyo, reported revenue of 9.3 trillion
yen ($121 billion) last year and has a market value of 2.1
trillion yen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tokyo-
based Mitsubishi Heavy posted sales of 2.9 trillion yen and is
valued at 1.18 trillion yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
