The  Inter-American Development Bank 
will loan two companies belonging to Uruguay’s Montes del Plata
Group $200 million to build a pulp mill that will include the
nation’s biggest biomass plant.  The IDB plans to raise a further $250 million from
commercial banks for the $2 billion venture that’s planned for
Punta Pereira in the southwest of the country, the Washington-
based bank said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  The 160-megawatt biomass plant will generate electricity
for the mill’s operations and the grid, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
