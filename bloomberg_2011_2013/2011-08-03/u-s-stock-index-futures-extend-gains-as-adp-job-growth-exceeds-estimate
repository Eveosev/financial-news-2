U.S. stock-index futures rose,
signaling the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may rebound from a
seven-day slump, after a private report showed employers added
more jobs than economists forecast last month.  Futures on the  S&P 500  expiring next month increased 0.5 
percent to 1,253.5 at 8:16 a.m. in  New York . Dow Jones 
Industrial Average futures climbed 36 points, or 0.3 percent, 
to 11,840.  Companies in the U.S. added 114,000 workers to payrolls in
July, according to figures from ADP Employer Services. The
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called
for an advance of 100,000. The data comes two days before a
government report projected to show an increase of 85,000 jobs.  Growing concern that the  U.S. economy  is faltering has
erased $1.07 trillion from American equities in less than two
weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500
plunged 2.6 percent yesterday, its biggest one-day loss in a
year and giving the index the longest losing streak since
October 2008, in the depths of the financial crisis caused by
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy.  U.S. stocks have become a “strong buy” following declines
in the past seven days, according to  Barton Biggs , managing
partner and co-founder of Traxis Partners LP in New York. Biggs
spoke on Bloomberg Television’s “InsideTrack” with Erik
Schatzker and Deirdre Bolton.  Per-share earnings increased 18 percent and sales rose 13
percent among the S&P 500 companies that have released quarterly
results since July 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
About 78 percent of the 352 companies have topped the average
analyst profit forecast, the data show. The S&P 500 traded at
13.8 times reported earnings, the cheapest level since July
2010.  Yesterday’s plunge will be followed by a rebound today, if
history is any guide. On the 16 occasions since the beginning of
2010 when the benchmark measure has dropped more than 1 percent
and closed near its low of the day, the gauge rose on the
following day 81 percent of the time, according to data compiled
by Birinyi Associates Inc.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
