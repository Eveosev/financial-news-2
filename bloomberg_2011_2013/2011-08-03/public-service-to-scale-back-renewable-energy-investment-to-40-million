(Corrects first and second paragraph to show cuts are in
one unit.)  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG) 
is scaling back renewable-energy investment at its PSEG Energy
Holdings unit as it boosts spending on transmission lines and
 power plants , Chief Financial Officer Caroline Dorsa said.  Public Service is cutting spending on renewables at the
unit to less than a tenth of its former level, to $40 million
from $570 million during the next two years, Dorsa said during
an investor conference call today.  The company, based in Newark,  New Jersey , is finding it
difficult to invest in projects that meet its “threshold of
return,” Dorsa said. PSEG Energy Holdings invests in solar,
offshore wind and compressed-air  energy storage , according to
its website.  Public Service is changing its investment strategy to focus
on regulated portions of its business, where it can recover
 capital costs  from consumers, Dorsa said. Returns on renewable
projects “are not the things that make sense for shareholders
on a risk-adjusted basis,” Dorsa said.  Today’s announcement doesn’t affect Public Service’s
planned investment in a 350-megawatt offshore wind farm, Michael
Jennings, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail.  Public Service will increase capital spending $200 million
to $6.9 billion through 2013, the company said in an earnings
statement today. The bulk of the increase will come at its PSE&G
utility, which recently gained approval from New Jersey
regulators to build three power plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
