Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the world’s largest
offshore driller, fell more than 4 percent after posting an 11th
straight quarterly profit decline amid a glut of rigs used to
find oil and natural gas.  Second-quarter net income declined to $155 million, or 48
cents a share, from $715 million, or $2.22, a year earlier, the
Vernier, Switzerland-based company said today in a statement.
Per-share profit was 27 cents below the average of 12 analysts’
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  The earnings were released after the close of regular
trading. Transocean fell $2.51, or 4.3 percent, to $56.52 at
7:04 p.m. New York time.  Daily rental rates for the company’s vessels dropped as
much as 26 percent during the second quarter because of rising
competition from rival operators and an influx of newer rigs
onto global drilling markets. Transocean had 28 percent of its
fleet of 134 offshore rigs parked in shipyards or waiting on
standby for new customers, according to a July 13 public filing.  Before today’s announcement, Transocean had fallen 22
percent since BP Plc filed a lawsuit on April 20 seeking
billions of dollars in damages for the driller’s role in the
catastrophe at BP’s Macondo well in the  Gulf of Mexico  that
triggered the worst offshore U.S. oil spill. Transocean owned
the rig and employed nine of the 11 workers killed when the well
spewed out of control.  The utilization rate for Transocean’s fleet declined to 55
percent during the April-to-June period from 64 percent a year
earlier. The company’s cash reserve shrank 11 percent during the
quarter to $3.39 billion.  Sales fell 5.8 percent to $2.33 billion, according to
today’s statement. The stock has 28 buy ratings, one sell and 18
holds.  (Transocean scheduled a conference call to discuss second-
quarter results for 10 a.m. New York time tomorrow. To access
