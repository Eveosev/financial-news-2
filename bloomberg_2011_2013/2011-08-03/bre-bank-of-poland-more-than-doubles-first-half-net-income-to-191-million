BRE Bank SA (BRE) , the Commerzbank AG unit
that’s  Poland ’s third-biggest lender by assets, said second-
quarter profit more than doubled after a gain from the sale of
bad loans.  Net income rose to 313.2 million zloty ($110.4 million)
from 131.4 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank
said in a regulatory statement today. That beat the mean 286.4
million-zloty estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  BRE booked an 89.3 million-zloty gain after selling 621
million zloty of bad retail loans to Kruk SA in June. Provisions
for bad loans fell to 58.6 million zloty from 203.5 million
zloty a year earlier. Combined net interest income and fees and
commissions income rose 23 percent to 750.7 million zloty.  First-half profit was 542.9 million zloty, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
