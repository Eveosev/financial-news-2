Jordan ’s imports of oil products such
as fuel oil and diesel rose 70 percent in the first seven months
of 2011 from a year earlier as the kingdom sought to offset
reduced natural-gas supply,  Al Ghad  said.  Jordan imported an average of 170,000 barrels of oil
products a day for power production this year, up from 100,000
barrels a day before the cuts, the newspaper reported. The
country paid 2 billion dinars ($2.8 billion) for fuel in the
first seven months of 2011, compared with 2.32 billion dinars
for the whole of 2010, it said.  The increase comes after repeated cuts in gas shipments
following sabotage attacks on  Egypt ’s export pipeline since
unrest erupted in the North African nation earlier this year, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
