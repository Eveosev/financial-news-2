A dispute over the structure of wage
negotiations at  Northam Platinum Ltd. (NHM)  in South Africa was
resolved, allowing the company to table its first pay offer on
Aug. 11, the National Union of Mineworkers said.  “The impasse has been resolved,” Zwelitsha Tantsi, chief
negotiator for the union said by mobile phone today. The union
declared a dispute on July 12 after Northam challenged NUM’s
demand to represent 100 percent of the company’s workers. NUM,
representing 89 percent, backed down on the demand today, Tantsi
said.  Northam’s only mine suffered a 43-day strike over pay last
year.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , the second-largest producer
of the metal, is scheduled to hold talks with NUM today while
talks with Anglo American Platinum Ltd., the largest, will
resume on Aug. 18.  South Africa  is the world’s largest platinum supplier.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
