The Czech Republic’s stock index fell
the most in more than a year after  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  said
second-quarter profit sank 36 percent and concern deepened that
global growth is faltering.  The PX gauge of 14 companies lost 1.9 percent to 1,145.6 at
its 4:28 p.m. close in  Prague , after earlier tumbling as much as
2.6 percent, the most since June 2010. Komercni Banka, with a 20
percent weighting in the index, slid 2.1 percent to a year low.  Net income for January to June was 2.1 billion koruna ($124
million), the Czech unit of  Societe Generale  SA said today. That
missed the 3.36 billion-koruna average estimate of five analysts
in a Bloomberg survey, as the bank took a 1.66 billion-koruna
impairment charge on Greek  government bonds .  “The big volume of impairment will be perceived
negatively, in particular in the current  market sentiment ,”
analysts at Prague-based J&T Banka wrote in a report. “The bank
wrote off about 30 percent of its exposure to Greek government
bonds held on its books and this should be a one-off effect.”  Investors ditched stocks worldwide and most emerging-market
currencies and bought U.S., German and Japanese bonds as signs
of slowing global economic growth stoked demand for the relative
safety of the governments’ debt. Societe Generale led losses
among European shares, tumbling as much as 9.7 percent after
saying the company may miss its 2012 earnings target as profit
missed analyst estimates.  In Prague,  Austria ’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  fell 4.7 percent,
the most in a year, to 744 koruna. Television broadcaster
 Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV)  slumped 6.9 percent to
296 koruna, its biggest one-day drop since October. Coal company
New World Resources Plc slumped 3.6 percent to 214 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
