Gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  weakened
after a report showed gasoline inventories increased in the
region and Colonial Pipeline Co. allocated shipments on its line
carrying fuel to the Northeast.  Supplies in the Gulf rose 2.08 million barrels to 73
million last week, an eight-week high, according to the Energy
Department. Colonial, which operates the largest pipeline
linking the Gulf Coast to U.S. East Coast markets, froze
nominations on its main gasoline line for cycle 45.  The discount for regular, 87-octane gasoline in the Gulf
Coast widened 0.7 cent to 10.5 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:43 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery of the
fuel slipped 10.2 cents to $2.8373 a gallon.  Gasoline stocks in the Gulf increased the most since the
week ended May 27 as refiners boosted operating rates by 1.2
percentage points to 88.5 percent, according to government data.  The Colonial pipeline ships products in five-day cycles
that run back-to-back. When the pipeline is full, refiners may
have to sell excess supply into the Gulf Coast market, which can
depress spot prices. The company also froze nominations for
cycle 43 and 44 this week.  The same fuel in  Chicago  widened its discount 2.25 cents to
6 cents a gallon versus futures, and weakened 0.5 cent to a
discount of 4.25 cents in the Midwest, or Group 3.  “It would seem that we could be headed back to double-
digit negative basis values, barring a hurricane or something
like that,” Lewis Adam, president of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply
consultant in  Kansas City , wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
