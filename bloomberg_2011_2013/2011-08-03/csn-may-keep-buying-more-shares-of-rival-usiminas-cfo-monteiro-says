Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA,
 Brazil ’s third-largest steelmaker, said it may keep buying more
stock in rival  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA (USIM5)  after
building a 10 percent stake in both preferred and common shares.  CSN, as the Sao Paulo-based company is known, is analyzing
options for its Usiminas holdings, Chief Financial Officer
Alberto Monteiro said today on an earnings conference call. CSN
increased its stake to 10.2 percent of Usiminas’s preferred
stock and 10.84 percent of the common shares, it said July 28.  “CSN continues evaluating the strategic alternatives of
our investment in Usiminas including possible additional share
acquisitions,” Monteiro said, declining to elaborate.  The steelmaker has been buying stock in its bigger
competitor since at least January, when CSN said it may increase
its stake in Usiminas to a level that could alter the rival’s
management or control structure. CSN said late yesterday that
second-quarter profit rose about 30 percent because of higher
iron-ore sales and a one-time gain from a stake sale.  CSN dropped 28 centavos, or 1.8 percent, to 15.24 reais in
Sao Paulo trading at 10:26 a.m. New York time on the comments
after earlier gaining as much as 2.4 percent. Usiminas’s
preferred shares, the most-traded class of stock, fell 3.1
percent to 10.60 reais. The common shares declined 1.4 percent
to 20.81 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
