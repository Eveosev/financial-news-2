Suez Environnement,  Europe ’s second-
largest water company, reported an 18 percent increase in first-
half profit and said volumes of waste treated rose.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, or ebitda, advanced to 1.23 billion euros ($1.75
billion), the company said today in a statement. That was in
line with the 1.22 billion euros estimate of 14 analysts by
Bloomberg. Net income fell 42 percent to 221 million euros as
proceeds from a Spanish transaction weren’t repeated.  The Paris-based utility said it’s keeping its 2011 to 2013
target of ebitda growth at least 7 percent on average at
constant exchange rates. It aims to raise the dividend around 5
percent annually for the three years through 2013, while net
income is expected to exceed 425 million euros this year.  “Commercial activity remained sustained,” Chief Executive
Officer Jean-Louis Chaussade said today. Growth in Europe was
driven in part by a rise in the amount of waste treated by the
utility, he said.  Suez Environnement has said 2011 will be a year of growth
after struggling, like larger rival  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) , to
boost industrial waste sorting following the 2009 recession that
forced factory clients to idle plants, reducing demand. Veolia
announced a plan last week for 800 million euros of writedowns
and said profit targets won’t be met.  Suez Environnement’s ebitda for its European waste handling
division rose 9 percent in the first half, while the total
volume of waste treated increased by 5.6 percent, it said.  Cutting Debt  The utility is seeking to reduce its debt-to-ebitda ratio
to about 3 by the end of 2011 from 3.22 at the end of 2010
following the acquisition of Spanish water supplier Sociedad
General de Aguas de Barcelona SA.  Net financial debt was stable at 7.58 billion euros on June
30 compared with the end of the year, the company said. It said
“abnormal weather conditions and labor action” in  Australia 
cost it 52 million euros in the first half. The expense, related
to a contract in  Melbourne , helped drive ebitda down 4 percent
at the international division, it said.  Suez Environnement has a target for cost savings of 300
million euros in the three years through 2012. It gets three-
quarters of its revenue from Europe.  The utility was spun off by Suez SA in 2008 when that
company merged with Gaz de France SA. The combined entity,  GDF
Suez (GSZ)  SA, owns 35 percent of the water and waste utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
