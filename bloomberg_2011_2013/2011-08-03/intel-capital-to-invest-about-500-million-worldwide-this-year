Intel Capital, the venture-capital
arm of the world’s biggest chipmaker, said it may boost its
investments by more than 50 percent this year, adding deals in
overseas markets including  China .  The investment arm of  Intel Corp. (INTC)  plans to invest about
$500 million globally in 2011, President Arvind Sodhani said at
a briefing in Beijing today. Intel Capital invested $327 million
last year, according to its website.  Intel Capital is stepping up its search for technology
companies in China, the world’s fastest-growing major economy,
where the firm has made six investments this year. That number
may increase to 12, Sodhani said today.  “We are very aggressive and very focused on china, and
we’ll continue to find innovative companies and invest in
them,” Sodhani said.  Intel Capital invested a combined $22 million in three
Chinese technology companies, 6DXchange Inc., Beijing JoySee
Technology Co. and Shanghai BOCOM Intelligent Network
Technologies Co., it said in a statement today.  It has invested more than $10 billion in more than 1,100
companies since 1991, according to the company.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
