Petrominerales Ltd., a Calgary-based
company that explores for and produces oil in Colombia, will
invest $600 million in the South American country this year,
Chief Executive Officer Corey Ruttan said.  The company’s shares began trading on Colombia’s bourse in
a dual listing today. Ruttan said Petrominerales doesn’t rule
out the possibility of selling new shares in Colombia.  “There’s no current plans,” Ruttan said in an interview.
“But never say never.”.  Petrominerales plans to drill 36 exploratory wells this
year, including in 10 blocks in central Colombia’s Llanos basin.
The company also has operations in Peru.  It is the third Canadian  oil company  to dual list in Bogota
after Toronto-based oil producers  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNEC)  and
 Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC)  listed shares in 2010 and 2009,
respectively.  Canacol has fallen 38 percent this year, the biggest loss
among companies on Colombia’s Colcap Index. Rubiales has fallen
23 percent, the third-biggest drop on the index this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
