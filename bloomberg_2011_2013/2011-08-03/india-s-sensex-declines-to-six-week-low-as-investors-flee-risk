Indian stocks slumped to the lowest
level in six weeks amid concern a faltering U.S. recovery may
stall global growth, and after earnings at India’s biggest
wireless operator missed estimates because of rising costs.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the largest wireless operator, tumbled
to the lowest level since July 26 after profit missed analysts’
estimates.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the biggest developer, slumped after saying
net income fell a more-than-forecast 13 percent on rising costs.
U.S. data today may probably show orders shrank, while a private
report may show employers added fewer workers in July, following
personal spending and income reports yesterday that missed
analyst estimates. Asian stocks had the biggest two-day drop
since March.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
169.34, or 0.9 percent, to 17,940.55 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai, the lowest level since June 23. The S&P CNX Nifty Index
slid 1 percent to 5,404.80. Its August futures closed at
5,429.45. The BSE 200 Index fell 0.8 percent.  “Not only did we go through a fairly surprise move by the
 Reserve Bank  of India a few days ago, we also now have to deal
with global headwinds,” said Nitin Rakesh, chief executive
officer of Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. in Mumbai. “The
issue is about slowdown in global growth. That’s keeping global
sentiments low.”  DLF fell 2.5 percent to 222.05 rupees, its lowest level in
three weeks. Net income slid to 3.58 billion rupees ($81
million) in the June quarter, from 4.11 billion rupees a year
earlier. That’s less than the 3.95 billion-rupee average of 19
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Bearish Bets  Bharti fell 1.4 percent to 426.25 rupees. Net income fell
27 percent to 12.2 billion rupees in the June quarter, trailing
the 14.8 billion-rupee median of 21 analysts’ estimates.  Options traders increased bearish bets on Bharti after the
earnings report. Combined open interest was 3,284 in  call
options , about 53 percent more than the previous day’s average,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Massive call-option writing at 440 rupees strike
indicates that the stock is likely to find near-term resistance
there,” said Navneet Daga, derivatives analyst at Kisanlal
Ratilal Choksey Shares and Securities Pvt. ’’Bharti is seeing
bearish buildup as huge costs incurred for network rollout will
hurt company earnings.’’  ‘On the Edge’  The odds of another U.S. downturn are rising amid cutbacks
in spending by consumers and the government, according to five
of the nine members of the U.S. panel that dates recessions. The
 U.S. economy  is ’’balanced on the edge’’ and there’s a 50
percent chance of sliding into another recession, Harvard
University economics professor  Martin Feldstein , a member of the
Business Cycle Dating Committee of the  National Bureau of
Economic Research , said in a Bloomberg Television interview.  The Sensex has lost 13 percent this year, the second-worst
performer after  Brazil ’s Bovespa among major indexes in the 10
biggest markets. Companies on the gauge trade at 14.5 times
estimated earnings, down from 21.5 times in March 2010.  “It is a great time to build a portfolio as valuations are
supportive,” said Prasun Gajri, chief investment officer at
HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co., which has more than $5 billion
in assets, in a interview to Bloomberg-UTV. “Global factors
will always remain on the horizon. Irrespective of  Europe  and
the U.S.,  India  will continue to remain a place where growth
will be reasonable.”  Sensex Earnings  Earnings reported by eight out of 19 Sensex companies, or
42 percent, have lagged behind analyst estimates for the three
months ended June. That compares with 33 percent that missed
forecasts in the previous quarter.  Credit Suisse Group AG reduced its earnings-per-share
forecast for Sensex companies 1.25 percent last month to 1,188
rupees, according to a report dated Aug. 1. Citigroup Inc. cut
the aggregate profit-growth forecast for companies on the gauge
to 21.5 percent from 24 percent previously, the brokerage said
in an Aug. 1 report.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the most valuable company, lost
1.5 percent to 825.05 rupees.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the biggest
truck maker and owner of Jaguar Land Rover, slid 3 percent to
928.15 rupees and its August futures closed at 930.75 rupees.  The  Reserve Bank of India  on July 26 raised the repurchase
rate to 8 percent from 7.5 percent, the 11th increase since the
start of 2010, and said it’s prepared to accept slower economic
growth to tackle inflation.  Inflation quickened to 9.44 percent in June from 9.06
percent in May. The Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 53.6 in
July from 55.3 in June, HSBC and Markit Economics said Aug. 2,
signaling consumer demand is waning.  Overseas investors bought a net 1.57 billion rupees ($36
million) of Indian equities on Aug. 1, raising total investment
in stocks this year to 102.4 billion rupees, according to data
on the  website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  To contact the reporters on this story:
