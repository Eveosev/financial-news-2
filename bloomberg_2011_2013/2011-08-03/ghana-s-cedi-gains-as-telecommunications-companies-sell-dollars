Ghana ’s cedi appreciated for a third
day against the dollar as telecommunication companies sold the
U.S. currency to pay for expenses.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
strengthened as much as 0.5 percent to 1.5046 per dollar and
traded at 1.5127 by 12:55 p.m in Accra, the capital, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The market is liquid today on the back of dollar sales by
telecommunication companies,” Othniel Kwainoe, a currency
trader at Standard Chartered Bank Plc’s local unit, said in a
telephone interview today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
