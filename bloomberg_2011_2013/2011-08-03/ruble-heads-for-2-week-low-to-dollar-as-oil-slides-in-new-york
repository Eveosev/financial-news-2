The ruble depreciated the most
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket in more
than two months as oil fell on concern the global economic
recovery will be derailed.  Russia’s currency slid 0.6 percent to 33.271 against the
basket at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest drop since May
23 based on closing prices. The ruble was 0.8 percent weaker at
39.86 per euro and down 0.3 percent at 27.88 per dollar.  U.S. service industries expanded in July at the slowest
pace since February 2010, while Moody’s Investors Service said
yesterday the nation’s credit rating may be downgraded. Crude
for September delivery fell as much as $2.04 to $91.75 a barrel.  “Lower risk appetite and  oil prices ” are hurting the
ruble, Arko Sen, director of debt and foreign-exchange strategy
for emerging  Europe , the  Middle East  and Africa at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch Global Research in  London , said by e-mail.
“External drivers are dominating at the moment.”  Russian  government bonds  rose, pushing the yield on the
dollar Eurobond due in 2020 down six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 4.109 percent. That’s the lowest since the
bonds were issued in April last year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Non-deliverable forwards, which provide a guide to
expectations of currency movements and allow companies to hedge
against them, show the ruble at 28.1495 per dollar in three
months, compared with 28.1681 yesterday.  Oil prices extended losses after a U.S. report showed an
increase in inventories last week. U.S. supplies rose 950,000
barrels in the week ended July 29, the Energy Department said
today in its weekly report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
