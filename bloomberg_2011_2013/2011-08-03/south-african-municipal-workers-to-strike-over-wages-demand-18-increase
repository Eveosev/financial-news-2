South African municipal workers will
strike over a pay dispute with the South African Local
Government Association, a labor union said.  The South African Municipal Workersâ€™ Union are demanding
pay increases of 18 percent, or 2,000 rand, whichever is the
greatest, the labor union said in an e-mailed statement today. A
mediator proposed increases of 7.5 percent, which the union
rejected, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
