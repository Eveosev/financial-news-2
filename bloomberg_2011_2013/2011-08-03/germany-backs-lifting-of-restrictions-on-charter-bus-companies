The German government approved a plan
to lift restrictions on charter-bus companies, opening the way
for increased competition with state railway Deutsche Bahn AG
and offering travelers more options for long-haul routes.  The liberalization fulfills an objective of  Chancellor
Angela Merkel ’s government by giving private charter-bus
companies access to a market dominated by state rail.  The changes mean travelers in  Germany  will be able to ride
more cheaply and environmentally, Transport Minister Peter Ramsauer said in a faxed statement after the Cabinet met in
Berlin today. The approval, which must clear Germany’s lower and
upper houses of parliament, will allow charter companies to
apply for operating licenses and is expected to go into effect
in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
