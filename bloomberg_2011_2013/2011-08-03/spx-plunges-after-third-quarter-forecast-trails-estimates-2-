SPX Corp. (SPW) , the maker of power-plant
cooling systems, tumbled after predicting lower earnings this
quarter than analysts estimated.  The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company’s projected
earnings of $1 to $1.10 a share in the third quarter trail the
$1.48 average estimate from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  That leaves “a large hurdle” in the fourth quarter for
SPX to achieve its full-year profit target of $4.25 to $4.55 a
share, C. Stephen Tusa, a New York-based analyst with JPMorgan
Chase & Co., said in a note to clients. He has an “overweight”
rating on the stock.  SPX fell $9.55, or 13 percent, to $61.23 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest decline
since April 2009.  Third-quarter earnings will be lowered by a drop of 24
cents a share in income from the thermal unit, the company’s
second-biggest, Chief Financial Officer Patrick O’Leary said on
a conference call with analysts and investors. He attributed the
decrease to fewer global power projects.  SPX will draw about 45 percent of 2011 earnings per share
from the fourth quarter, O’Leary said. The company has typically
drawn 35 percent to 40 percent of full-year profit from the last
quarter.  “The back-end loaded nature of the earnings this year will
disappoint investors,” given broader economic concerns, Sheila Kahyaoglu, a New York-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG,
said in a note to clients. Credit Suisse rates the shares
“outperform.”  Net income at the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based company
declined 56 percent to $34.3 million, or 67 cents a share in the
second quarter, from $78.8 million, or $1.57, a year earlier.  Earnings excluding a writedown to SPX Heat Transfer Inc.
assets were 91 cents a share, trailing estimates from firms
including Credit Suisse, which projected 92 cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
