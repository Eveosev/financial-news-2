President  Barack Obama  plans a bus
tour of the Midwest the week of Aug. 15 with a focus on jobs, a
White House official said.  Jennifer Psaki, the White House deputy communications
director, confirmed a report in today’s New York Times but
didn’t offer any additional details. The president, after
signing deficit-reduction legislation yesterday, said he would
be turning his attention to “new jobs, higher wages and faster
economic growth.”  Obama is heading to Chicago tonight for two campaign fund-
raisers, the first time away from the Washington area since a
June 28 trip to Bettendorf,  Iowa , for a speech on manufacturing,
jobs and the economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
