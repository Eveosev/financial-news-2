29 regulatory filing.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in Colombia, fell 1.6 percent

July 18 at the Rubiales field operated by the company, Dinero
reported on its daily website. Rodado said July production
instead reached 929,226.  To contact the reporter on this story:
