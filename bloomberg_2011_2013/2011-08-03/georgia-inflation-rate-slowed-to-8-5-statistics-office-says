Georgia ’s inflation rate slowed in
July for a second month as food prices dropped, the statistics
office in Tbilisi said in an e-mailed statement today.  Consumer prices rose 8.5 percent in July from a year
earlier, compared with 10 percent in June, the office said.
Prices fell 1.6 percent in July from the previous month.  Georgian inflation will slow to 7.5 percent by the end of
the year, after accelerating to 13.9 percent in the first
quarter, the central bank said last month.  Inflation has exceeded the central bank’s 6 percent target
for 13 months, driven by food prices that comprise more than 40
percent of Georgia’s consumer-inflation basket.  To contact the reporter on this story:
