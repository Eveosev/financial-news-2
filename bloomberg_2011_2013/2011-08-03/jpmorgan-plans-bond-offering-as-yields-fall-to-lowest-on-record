JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the most
prolific U.S. issuer of corporate bonds this year, tapped the
market again as yields on the debt fall to the lowest on record.  JPMorgan sold $1.25 billion of 4.35 percent, 10-year notes,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investment-grade
corporate bond yields fell to 3.51 percent yesterday, surpassing
the previous all-time low of 3.53 percent set Nov. 4, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data show.  Borrowing costs for companies are plunging along with
Treasury yields amid mounting evidence that the  U.S. economy  is
faltering. Banks have taken advantage of the decline to lock in
funding, selling about 60 percent of investment-grade corporate
bonds last month, the biggest proportion of 2011, Bloomberg data
show.  JPMorgan’s notes yield 175 basis points, or 1.75 percentage
points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries. The New York-
based company sold $17.6 billion of bonds in the U.S. this year
through yesterday, including $855 million of 3.15 percent, five-
year notes on July 29, Bloomberg data show.  Its $2 billion of 4.625 percent notes due in May 2021
traded yesterday at 103.4 cents on the dollar to yield 158 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Banks’ issuance accounted for $31.6 billion of last month’s
$50.2 billion of investment-grade corporate bond sales in the
U.S., Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
