Billionaire  Nelson Peltz  increased
his stake in  Legg Mason Inc. (LM)  by about 24 percent this week as
U.S. markets declined.  Trian Fund Management LP, the New York-based investment
advisory run by Peltz and Peter May, spent about $76.5 million
to acquire 2.65 million Legg Mason shares this week, according
to a Form 4 filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  The purchases, which Trian made over the past three days,
increased the fund’s stake in Legg Mason to 13.9 million shares,
according to today’s filing. That equaled 9.4 percent of Legg
Mason’s shares outstanding, up from 7.6 percent prior to this
week.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index plunged 2.6 percent
yesterday, a decline that erased the U.S. benchmark’s gains for
2011 and left it trading at its cheapest valuation in more than
a year. The  S&P 500  rose 0.5 percent today, as investors
speculated that the  Federal Reserve  will start another stimulus
program.  Legg Mason shares touched $27.83 today, their lowest price
this year. The stock later rebounded to $29.06 at 4:15 p.m. New
York time, up $1.11, or 4 percent, for the day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
