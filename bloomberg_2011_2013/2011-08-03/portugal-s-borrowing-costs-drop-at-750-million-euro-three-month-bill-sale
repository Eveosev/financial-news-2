Portugal ’s borrowing costs dropped at
an auction of 750 million euros ($1.07 billion) of three-month
bills.  The securities due in November were issued at an average
yield of 4.967 percent, the country’s debt management agency
said. That compares with an average yield of 4.982 percent at a
previous auction of three-month bills on July 20. The auction
attracted bids for 2.6 times the amount offered, compared with a
bid-to-cover ratio of 2.4 in July.  The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, on July 28 said the
indicative amount for today’s auction was between 500 million
euros and 750 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
