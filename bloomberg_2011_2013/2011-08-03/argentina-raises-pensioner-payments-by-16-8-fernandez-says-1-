Argentine retirees will receive a
16.8 percent increase in the minimum pension, taking the
increase this year to 37.1 percent, President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  said in a speech in Buenos Aires today.  The increase announced today, the second this year, will
cost the government 20 billion pesos ($4.8 billion), Fernandez
said.  A total of 6.83 million pensioners will benefit from the
increase, which will raise the minimum payment to 1,434 pesos
($345) a month starting in September, she said.  Since Fernandez seized about $24 billion in private pension
funds in late 2008, the social security agency is obliged by law
to increase pensions twice a year. Adjustments are calculated
using a formula that takes into account increases in government
revenue and in workersâ€™ wages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
