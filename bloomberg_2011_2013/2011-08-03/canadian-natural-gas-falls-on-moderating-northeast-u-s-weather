Canadian natural gas fell as normal
temperatures were forecast for the U.S. Northeast and Midwest
for the next two weeks, curbing demand for the power-plant fuel.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , were flat as
MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland, forecast normal
weather for the Northeast and Midwest from Aug. 7 to Aug. 16.  “When you’ve had a long hot trend, generally it’s going to
break at some point,” Jim Osten, director of natural gas at IHS
CERA in  Boston , said in a telephone interview. “People are
looking forward to the fall weather and what seems to be an
oversupply situation.”  Alberta gas for September delivery declined 1 cent to
C$3.31 per gigajoule ($3.26 per million British thermal units)
as of 3:30 p.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX , a Canadian
Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange goes to users in
Canada and the U.S. and is priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta
system.  Natural gas for September delivery fell 6.5 cents, or 1.6
percent, to settle at $4.09 per million Btu on the Nymex.  Power plants  use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies, according
to the Energy Department.  Gas Flows  The high in Boston today may reach 76 degrees (24 Celsius),
6 below normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. of  State College ,
Pennsylvania.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.2 billion cubic
feet as of 2:30 p.m. in New York.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.86 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.03 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 993 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.77 billion cubic feet today, about 64 percent of its
capacity of 2.76 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
fell 5.61 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $4.3362 per million Btu on
the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that
can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from
western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas dropped 1.02 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $3.9357.  To contact the reporter on this story:
