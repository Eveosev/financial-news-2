The debt-reduction agreement signed
by President Barack Obama leaves the U.S. “worse off,”
according to Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive officer of Pimco.  “Both the deal and the run-up to the deal were such that
we are worse off today than we were before,” El-Erian said in
an interview airing on CNN’s “Piers Morgan Tonight.” “Growth
will be lower, unemployment will be higher.”  The “squabbles” leading up to the accord showed the U.S.
has “weak economic governance,” and the deal did little to
lower the country’s debt, El-Erian said. Pimco, based in Newport
Beach,  California , manages the world’s biggest bond mutual fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
