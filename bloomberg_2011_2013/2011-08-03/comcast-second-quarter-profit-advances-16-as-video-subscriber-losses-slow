Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest U.S. cable
company, posted a 16 percent increase in second-quarter profit
after adding  Internet users , boosting sales at its NBC Universal
unit and reducing video-subscriber losses.  Net income climbed to $1.02 billion, or 37 cents a share,
from $884 million, or 31 cents, a year earlier, Philadelphia-
based Comcast said today in a statement. Excluding some costs,
profit was 42 cents a share, topping the 41-cent average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Comcast lost 238,000
video subscribers in the quarter, 10 percent fewer than in the
year-ago period, when it lost 265,000.  Slowing video losses indicate Comcast is holding up against
competition from  AT&T Inc. (T) ’s U-verse, Verizon Communications
Inc.’s FiOS, and satellite-television providers DirecTV and Dish
Network Corp. It’s also a sign that demand for online-video
providers such as Netflix Inc. and Hulu LLC isn’t increasing the
rate at which customers abandon cable TV, said  Craig Moffett , an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York.  “The cable side of Comcast is operating at a very high
level and is out-executing the other U.S. operators at this
point,” said Moffett, who rates Comcast shares “outperform.”  Cable competitors Time Warner Cable Inc. and Charter
Communications Inc. both reported they lost more video
subscribers in the second quarter than a year earlier.  Comcast added 144,000 broadband subscribers, up 22 percent
from a year ago, and 193,000 voice customers, 16 percent fewer
than a year ago.  Shares of Comcast rose 4 cents to $22.77 at 4 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. They have risen 3.6 percent
this year.  NBC Universal   Revenue rose 9.4 percent to $14.3 billion. That compares to
an average estimate of $13.8 billion from analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Thirty-six percent of Comcast’s sales came
from NBC Universal in the quarter, which had $5.18 billion in
revenue compared with $4.42 billion a year ago. Comcast bought
51 percent of NBC in January from General Electric Co. for $13.8
billion in cash and assets.  Broadcast television revenue for NBC was $1.7 billion, up
19 percent from a year ago. NBC’s broadcast-TV advertising
revenue rose 6.8 percent to $1.11 billion even though its
regularly scheduled primetime programming trailed its network
competition -- CBS Corp.’s CBS, News Corp.’s Fox and Walt Disney
Co.’s ABC -- in ratings in the season ended in May, according to
data from Horizon Media Inc.  ‘Right Levers’  Cable-network revenue, which includes NBC Universal
stations such as Bravo,  MSNBC , and USA and Comcast-owned
networks E! and Golf Channel, rose 13 percent to $2.17 billion.  “Comcast is pulling all of the right levers,” said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg Industries in New York, before
the results were released. “They’re getting ad revenue at NBC
and the cable stations, they’re buying back stock and they’re
paying a dividend to shareholders.”  Comcast boosted its annual dividend in February by 19
percent to 45 cents a share and paid out $311 million in the
second quarter. The cable provider bought back $525 million in
shares this quarter and has $1.09 billion remaining in its board
authorization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
