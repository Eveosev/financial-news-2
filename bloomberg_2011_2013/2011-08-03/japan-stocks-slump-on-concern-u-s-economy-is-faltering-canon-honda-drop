Japanese stocks fell by the most
since the aftermath of the March earthquake and tsunami as an
unexpected drop in U.S. consumer spending amplified concern that
the world’s biggest economy is faltering, dimming prospects for
exporters and banks.  Honda Motor Co., which gets more than 40 percent of sales
in  North America , lost 3.2 percent.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s largest bank by market value, slipped 2
percent after  Daiwa Securities  Capital Markets Co. cut its
rating on its shares. Ibiden Co., an electronics and ceramics
maker, plunged 6.9 percent after cutting its profit forecast.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 2.1 percent to 9,637.14
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index declined 2
percent to 826.75 with all its 33 industry groups retreating.
Both gauges had the biggest drop since March 15, after the March
11 magnitude-9 temblor, tsunami and nuclear disaster triggered
the biggest two-day rout of Japanese stocks since October 1987.  “With the weak economic data in the U.S., people have
started to worry whether the economy will really be able to pick
up,” said Kenji Sekiguchi, general manager at Mitsubishi UFJ
Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $75
billion. “The outlook for earnings at exporters is becoming
more uncertain. We cannot help thinking it will take a while for
Japanese stocks to rebound.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2
percent today. In  New York  yesterday, the index retreated 2.6
percent, the most in almost a year, to a seven-month low of
1,254.05 after the consumer spending report.  Exporters Drop  U.S. stocks fell for a seventh consecutive day yesterday,
the longest losing streak since an eight-day period ended in
October 2008, erasing the 2011 gain for the  S&P 500 . The Stoxx
Europe 600 Index lost 1.9 percent to 256.98 in  London , the
lowest level since Aug. 31, entering a so-called correction with
the index dropping 10 percent from the year’s high point.  Exporters in Japan retreated on concern earnings will be
hurt as the  U.S. economy  slows. Honda closed at 3,010 yen.
 Kyocera Corp. (6971) , a maker of solar panels that gets 17 percent of
its sales in the U.S., declined 2.3 percent to 8,040 yen.  Canon
Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker, dropped 1.7 percent to
3,690 yen.  Commerce Department figures showed consumer purchases slid
0.2 percent in June after a 0.1 percent gain in May. It was the
first drop in spending in almost two years. The median estimate
of 77 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 0.1
percent increase. Incomes grew at the slowest pace since
November and the savings rate climbed.  Confidence Slumps  A slump in confidence threatens to derail the U.S. economy.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment fell in July to the weakest level since March
2009. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index also dropped in the
week ended July 24 to the lowest level since May.  The Senate voted yesterday to ratify a U.S. debt-limit
compromise that will avert a default even as it defers decisions
on the nation’s finances to a bipartisan panel and may only
modestly reduce deficits. The House on Aug. 1 approved the
measure, which raises the national debt ceiling enough to fund
the government until 2013 and threatens automatic spending cuts
to enforce a goal of cutting $2.4 trillion over the next decade.  Moody’s Investors Service said the U.S. credit rating may
be downgraded for the first time on concern that fiscal
discipline may ease, further debt-reduction measures won’t be
adopted and the economy may weaken. The U.S., rated Aaa since
1917, was placed on negative outlook, New York-based Moody’s
said in a statement.  Yen Talks  The yen appreciated to 76.96 against the dollar, compared
with 77.42 at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday.
Against the euro,  Japan ’s currency strengthened to 109.21 from
110.32. A stronger yen hurts Japanese exporters because it cuts
the value of overseas sales.  Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said today he’s concerned about
recent movements in the foreign-exchange market.  Bank of Japan 
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the central bank will closely
monitor the effect of the yen’s appreciation over the economy.  Carmakers also declined after  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and Honda
posted declines in U.S. sales in July. Toyota sales fell 23
percent to 130,802, while Honda deliveries plunged 28 percent to
80,502. Toyota shares dropped 1.3 percent to 3,120 yen.  Banks retreated after Daiwa Securities cut its rating on
lenders including Mitsubishi UFJ,  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc. (8316)  and  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  to “neutral” from
“outperform” after their shares rose to levels close to their
target prices.  Banks Retreat  Mitsubishi UFJ closed at 392 yen.  Sumitomo Mitsui , Japan’s
second-largest bank by market value, dropped 2.1 percent to
2,428 yen. Mizuho, the No. 3, retreated 1.6 percent to 127 yen.  Ibiden ended the day at 2,139 yen, falling the most since
March 15. The company cut its full-year net income forecast 48
percent to 12.3 billion yen ($159 million), citing a slowdown of
the U.S. and European economies and concern anti-inflation
measures in emerging markets will damp growth.  Nitto Boseki Co., a maker of textiles, building materials
and glass fiber, plunged 10 percent to 202 yen, the most on the
Nikkei. The company projected net income will decline 15 percent
to 2.4 billion yen in the year ending in March 2012, citing
additional charges due to possible aftershocks. It had earlier
forecast profit would rise to 3 billion yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
