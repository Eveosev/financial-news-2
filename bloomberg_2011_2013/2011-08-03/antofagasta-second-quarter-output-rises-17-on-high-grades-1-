Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the copper producer
controlled by Chile’s Luksic family, said second-quarter output
increased 17 percent because of additional ore from the
Esperanza mine and higher ore grades at Los Pelambres.  Copper output climbed to 158,700 metric tons in the
quarter, the company said in a statement today. First-half
output was 288,500 tons, up 14 percent from a year earlier.  Los Pelambres, the company’s largest plant, increased
production as copper metal grades rose and it processed more
ore, the company said. Additional production from Esperanza,
which began shipping in January, also helped output.  Copper producers are boosting output amid rising demand for
the metal used in cables and pipes. Antofagasta on June 8 cut
its 2011 production target from 713,000 tons to as much as
640,000 tons, saying a ramp-up at Esperanza is taking longer
than planned.  “There is a risk of the shares de-rating if the Esperanza
project does not meet management’s lowered guidance for the
production ramp-up in 2011,” Gavin Wood, an analyst at
Arbuthnot Securities Ltd., said in a note today. “We
believe that the market has overestimated the value of
Antofagasta’s growth projects.”  Antofagasta rose 0.5 percent to 1,334 pence at 10:26 a.m.
in London trading, valuing the company at 13.1 billion pounds
($21.5 billion).  Esperanza operated at a daily rate of 53,300 tons in the
quarter and is expected to produce 80,000 tons to 100,000 tons
this year, Antofagasta said. Net cash costs declined to 103.8
cents per pound from 107.8 cents the previous quarter on reduced
costs at Esperanza and El Tesoro mines, it said.  At Los Pelambres, production of molybdenum, a byproduct of
mining used to harden steel, rose 13 percent to 2,600 tons from
the previous quarter, Antofagasta said. Gold production in the
second quarter was 48,600 ounces, compared with 22,100 ounces in
the previous three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
