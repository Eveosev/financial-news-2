The Swiss franc depreciated against
all of its major peers on speculation that the nation’s central
bank will sell the currency after saying it’s “massively
overvalued.”  Switzerland’s currency weakened for the first time in six
days against the euro. The  Swiss National Bank  unexpectedly cut
 interest rates  and increased the supply of francs to money
markets in an attempt to stem the currency’s surge.  “This is a threat from the SNB that it can upset the
franc’s appreciation,” said  Adam Cole , global head of currency
strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in London.  The Swiss currency weakened 1.9 percent to 77.69 centimes
per dollar as of 10:54 a.m. in London, having reached a record
76.10 centimes earlier today. The franc depreciated 2.8 percent
against the euro to 1.11251, reversing a gain to a record
1.07958.  “Euro-Swiss would have to reach 1.08 again before we would
expect any intervention,” Cole said.  Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann said on July 31
that the strength of the franc would lead to “extremely tough
years” for Swiss exporters and the  tourism industry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
