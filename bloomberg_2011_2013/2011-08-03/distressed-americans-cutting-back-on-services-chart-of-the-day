Spending on services, the biggest
part of the  U.S. economy , has barely budged in the two years
since the recession ended as “distressed” households hold the
line on everything from vacations to restaurant visits.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows spending on services adjusted
for inflation has increased 2.2 percent since the economic slump
ended and the recovery began in June 2009. Purchases of non-
durable goods have climbed about 5 percent, while expenditures
on durable goods like cars are up 15 percent.  “Consumers, reacting to distressed balance sheets and a
considerable loss of wealth, are increasing personal savings and
reducing debt,” said  Michelle Meyer , a senior economist at Bank
of America Merrill Lynch in  New York . “Consumers have changed
their behavior and done without certain discretionary
services.”  Spending on services has “flat-lined,” said Meyer, in
part because the slump in housing and financial meltdown that
triggered the recession prompted household to cut back on
mortgages, utilities and the use of credit cards.  “In order for there to be a broad-based, sustainable
recovery, we need to see a recovery in the services side as well
as manufacturing,” she said. Services accounted for 65 percent
of all consumer purchases in the second quarter, according to
figures from the Commerce Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
