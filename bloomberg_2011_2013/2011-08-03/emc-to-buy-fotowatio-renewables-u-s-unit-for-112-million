MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) , a
solar-wafer maker and project developer, agreed to buy the U.S.
development unit of closely held Fotowatio Renewable Ventures
for $112 million.  MEMC will pay as much as $126.5 million more, including
about $22.9 million in intercompany debt and capital and $103.6
million if the unit achieves certain performance targets, the
St. Peters, Missouri-based company said in a statement today.  Fotowatio Renewable Ventures Inc. has 42 megawatts of solar
projects in operation in the U.S., including a 14-megawatt
project at Nellis Air Force Base in  Nevada , according to the
statement. The purchase will also include  28 projects currently
in development, adding up to 1.4 gigawatts to MEMCâ€™s pipeline of
solar project developments.  The acquisition is expected to close in the third or fourth
quarter, subject to closing conditions, including regulatory
approvals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
