Investors nervous about the prospect
of a default by the U.S. government pulled money out of all
forms of mutual funds, from money-market funds to those that
invest in stocks.  U.S. money-market funds experienced $103 billion in
redemptions the week ended Aug. 2, the most in one week since
the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September
2008, according to iMoneyNet, a fund research firm in
Westborough,  Massachusetts .  Mutual funds that invest in stocks and bonds had net
redemptions of $10.4 billion in the week ended July 27,
according to an e-mailed statement from the  Investment Company
Institute,  a Washington-based trade group. It was the biggest
withdrawal since the week ended May 26, 2010, when investors
pulled $17.4 billion, ICI data show.  “We saw people get nervous in May during the Greek debt
crisis and this situation hit much closer to home,”  Russel Kinnel , director of mutual fund research at Chicago-based
 Morningstar Inc. (MORN) , said in a telephone interview.  After weeks of failed negotiations, U.S. congressional
leaders and the White House agreed to raise the U.S. debt
ceiling yesterday, the same day the Treasury Department said the
government would run out of money. Republicans had refused to
back the measure until Democrats agreed to a long-term deficit-
reduction plan.  U.S. debt  still faces a potential downgrade by
ratings firms.  U.S. Equity Funds  Money funds lost more only once before, when investors
pulled $121 billion in the week ended Sept. 23, 2008. Lehman
declared bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008, and the $62.5 billion
Reserve Primary Fund, which held Lehman debt, closed the
following day, triggering a run on money funds eligible to buy
corporate debt, known as prime funds.  Institutional prime funds lost $61 billion and
institutional government funds had $47 billion in withdrawals
last week, according to iMoneyNet. Retail government funds lost
$1 billion, while retail prime funds attracted $6 billion in
deposits.  Funds that invest in U.S. stocks suffered $8.8 billion in
redemptions last week, the most among stock and bond funds. Such
funds had $9 billion in withdrawals in the first six months of
2011, ICI data show, which puts them on pace for a record fifth-
straight year of redemptions.  Investors withdrew $1.34 billion from funds that buy
international stocks, $67 million from taxable bond funds and
$147 million from municipal bond funds, ICI data show.  Downgrade Risk Remains  Moody’s Investors Service, which found the deficit-
reduction deal insufficient, put the U.S. on notice that it is
at risk of a downgrade without additional deficit reduction
measures. While the New York-based firm retained its AAA rating
on U.S. debt, the outlook is now negative.  The most recent data on the  U.S. economy  has raised concerns
about a slowdown and possibly a recession.  Gross domestic product expanded at a 1.3 percent annual
rate in the second quarter, after a 0.4 percent pace in the
prior period, the worst six months since the recovery began in
June 2009, according to Commerce Department figures released
July 29.  “There’s now a 50 percent chance that we could slide into
a new recession,”  Martin Feldstein , a Harvard University
economics professor, said yesterday in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene .  To contact the reporters on this story:
