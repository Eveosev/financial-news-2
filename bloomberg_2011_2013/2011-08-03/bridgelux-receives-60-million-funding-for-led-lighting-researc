Bridgelux Inc., a maker of light-
emitting diode, or LED, lighting technologies, received $60
million in financing led by Craton Equity Partners.  Bridgelux will invest the funds in research and
development, concentrating on products such as gallium nitride
on silicon, or GaN-on-Si, and LED “chip-on-board” technology,
Los Angeles-based Craton said today in a statement. The
financing brings Bridgelux’s total funds raised to $180 million.  Prices for LEDs may fall 90 percent by 2015 as they replace
less efficient incandescent  light bulbs  in many countries and
compact fluorescent bulbs, which contain mercury. Bridgelux
expects the market for so-called solid-state lighting to triple
this year to more than $3 billion, Chief Executive Officer Bill Watkins said in the statement.  Governments are promoting the use of LED lighting in a bid
to save energy and reduce polluting emissions. The U.S. Energy
Department  said today  that if every 60-watt incandescent bulb in
the U.S. was replaced with a 10-watt LED bulb, the nation would
save about 35 terawatt-hours of electricity, or $3.9 billion, a
year and avoid 20 million metric tons of carbon output.  Existing investors including VantagePoint Capital Partners,
El Dorado Ventures LP, Novus Energy Partners LP, Invus Group
LLC,  Harris & Harris Group Inc. (TINY)  and Passport Capital LLC also
took part in the funding round, Craton said. David Asarnow,
principal of Craton, will join the Bridgelux board as an
observer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
