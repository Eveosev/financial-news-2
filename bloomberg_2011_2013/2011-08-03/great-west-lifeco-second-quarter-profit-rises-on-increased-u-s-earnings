Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO) ,  Canada ’s
second-largest insurer, said second-quarter profit rose 16
percent on stronger earnings from U.S. operations.  Net income climbed to C$526 million ($547 million), or 55
cents a share, from C$455 million, or 48 cents a year earlier,
the Winnipeg, Manitoba-based company said today in a statement.
The insurer was expected to earn 46 cents a share, the average
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Great-West, controlled by Montreal’s billionaire Desmarais
family, said U.S. earnings more than doubled to C$128 million
because of the release of a legal provision at its Putnam
Investments unit.  Great-West rose 60 cents to C$23.38 in trading today on the
Toronto Stock Exchange before results were released.  (Great-West Lifeco will hold a conference call at 9 a.m.
Toronto time tomorrow to discuss second-quarter results. To
