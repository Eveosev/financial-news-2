Mexico ’s government welcomed Anthony Wayne as the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico and expressed its
intention to work with him to strengthen relations, according to
an e-mail sent late last night by the Foreign Affairs Ministry.  The U.S. Senate yesterday approved Wayne’s nomination after
previous Ambassador Carlos Pascual resigned on March 19 after
President Felipe Calderon complained over comments in cables
released by WikiLeaks, in which Pascual expressed concern that
Mexican security authorities weren’t sufficiently coordinated.  Wayne’s previous post was as U.S. Ambassador to  Argentina .  To contact the reporter on this story:
