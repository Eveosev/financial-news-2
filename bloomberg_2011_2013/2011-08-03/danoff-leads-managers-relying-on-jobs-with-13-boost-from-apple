William Danoff might want to send a
thank-you note to Steven Jobs,  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s chief executive
officer .  Danoff’s $78 billion Fidelity Contrafund got 13 percent of
its return over the past two-and-a-half years from its stake in
Apple. The fund, a portfolio with 494 stocks as of June 30, is
one of six among Apple’s 10 biggest U.S. mutual fund holders who
can credit at least 13 percent of their return since 2009 to the
technology giant, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Apple, the maker of iPhones and iPads, has risen five-fold
since early 2009, powering the stock market rally and attracting
top mutual-fund and hedge-fund managers searching for returns.
As the company’s weight in the market and in many funds has
grown, stock pickers need to be wary they don’t become overly
reliant on a single stock, said John Buckingham, chief
investment officer at Al Frank Asset Management, which oversees
$500 million.  “With the history of high flyers that have crashed and
burned, the last thing a  fund manager  should do is let a
position grow too large,” said Buckingham, who won’t let a
stock get beyond 3 percent to 4 percent of the portfolio. “I
don’t see how you can take more risk than that no matter how
much you like Apple.”  Buckingham, whose company is based in Laguna Beach,
 California , has owned Apple since 2002 when the shares averaged
less than $10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. He said
he has trimmed his Apple holdings in the $102 million Al Frank
Fund regularly over the years. At the end of June, Apple
represented 1 percent of the fund.  ‘It Takes Courage’  Apple closed above $400 a share for the first time on July
26, up from $78.20 on Jan. 20, 2009, when the combination of a
recession and shaky credit markets drove almost all equities
lower. Apple closed yesterday at $388.91. The stock has added
almost $300 billion in market value over those 30 months.  Since Jan. 20, 2009, when it reached a low during the
credit crisis, Apple has been responsible for about 7.3 percent
of the gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, more than twice
the contribution of the runner-up, Armonk, New York-based
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “It takes a lot of courage to build up a big position the
way he has,” James Lowell, editor of Fidelity Investor, a
Needham, Massachusetts, newsletter, said in a telephone
interview, referring to Danoff. “If the stock had gone the
other way it could have ended up tarnishing a career.”  Driving the Market  Danoff, 51, last year celebrated his 20th anniversary as
manager of the Contrafund, which had $300 million in assets when
he took it over. In the 20 years ended June 30, the fund
returned 12 percent a year compared with 8.7 percent for the  S&P
500  Index. Danoff was named Morningstar’s domestic stock-fund
manager of the year for 2007.  Apple represents 3.1 percent of the S&P 500, second only to
Irving, Texas-based  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , which has a weighting of
3.3 percent. Danoff’s Contrafund had 6.8 percent of its assets
in Apple, owning 16 million shares as of June 30, making it the
largest mutual fund holder of the stock. Apple accounted for 13
percent of the fund’s gains since Jan. 20, 2009, according to
Bloomberg calculations.  The other funds among the 10 biggest holders that got at
least that much help from Apple were the $17.7 billion Fidelity
Advisor New Insights Fund (13 percent), the $7.8 billion
 Fidelity OTC Portfolio (FOCPX)  (14 percent), the $26.7 billion T. Rowe
Price Growth Stock Fund (15 percent), the $8.7 billion Janus
Twenty Fund (28 percent) and the $5.5 billion Janus Forty Fund
(23 percent).  Beating the Index  Bloomberg portfolio analysis allows measuring how much an
individual stock contributes to a mutual fund’s performance over
any given period of time. Because the fund data is gathered on
either a monthly or quarterly basis, the calculation is
approximate, not precise. The analysis cannot be done on mutual
funds that own both stocks and bonds.  While it has helped performance, owning Apple is no
guarantee a fund will outperform peers. The two Janus funds
equaled approximately the 69 percent return in the S&P 500
between Jan. 20, 2009, and Aug. 1, 2011.  The other four funds did better, with T. Rowe Price Growth
returning 89 percent and Fidelity OTC gaining 126 percent. The
two funds managed by Danoff,  Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX)  and Fidelity
Advisor New Insights, rose 74 percent and 72 percent,
respectively.  Janus Twenty  Janus Twenty, which had the largest contribution to
performance from Apple, fared the worst, rising 68 percent.  “The past two years have been miserable for this fund,”
Kathryn Young, an analyst at Morningstar, wrote in a July note.
Young said the poor showing was a reflection of losses in
holdings such as  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  San Jose , California-
based  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)   Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America fell 29
percent this year; Cisco dropped 24 percent. Janus Twenty sold
both holdings as of June 30, Bloomberg data show.  The fund, run by Ron Sachs, 44, is a concentrated portfolio
that typically holds 20 to 30 stocks, according to the website
of Denver, Colorado-based Janus Capital Group Inc. Sachs wasn’t
available to comment because Janus managers do not discuss
individual stocks, James Aber, a spokesman for the company,
wrote in an e-mail.  The fund cut its holdings of Apple shares by more than 50
percent between Oct. 31, 2009, and March 31, 2011, regulatory
filings show.  The “growth outlook for the company remains bright,” P.
Robert Bartolo, manager of T. Rowe Price Growth Stock fund,
wrote to shareholders in a January 2011 letter. He cited the
expansion of Apple’s retail outlets among the reasons.  Cutting Back  Apple grew to 7.5 percent of Bartolo’s fund in the two
years ended Dec. 31, 2010, from 3.6 percent, regulatory filings
show. The stock represented 7.3 percent of the portfolio as of
March 31.  Bartolo, 39, has been managing Growth Fund since 2007. The
fund, Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price Group Inc.’s largest,
returned 4.9 percent a year in the five years ended June 30,
compared with 2.9 percent for the  S&P 500 Index (SPX) , Bloomberg data
show.  T. Rowe Price declined to make Bartolo available, Heather
McDonold, a spokeswoman for the company, wrote in an e-mail.  Both Bartolo and Danoff have cut their Apple holdings as
the company’s market value grew. Bartolo held 5.6 million shares
as of March 31, down from 6.3 million shares at the end of 2009,
according to regulatory filings.  At Danoff’s Contrafund, Apple represented 2.1 percent of
holdings, with 11.7 million Apple shares at the end of 2008,
according to  filings  with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. By the end of 2010, Apple was 7.1 percent of the
fund and the share count reached 16.5 million. Between Dec. 31
and June 30, the fund cut its holdings of Apple by about half a
million shares, Bloomberg data show.  Cisco’s Example  A second fund managed by Danoff, Fidelity Advisor New
Insights Fund, had 6.3 percent of its assets in Apple, or 3.4
million shares, as of June 30, according to Bloomberg data.  Fidelity managers can’t discuss individual holdings, said
Sophie Launay, a spokeswoman for the firm, explaining why no one
from the company would talk about Apple.  Geoff Bobroff, a mutual-fund consultant based in  East
Greenwich ,  Rhode Island , said managers who bet heavily on Apple
need to be aware that technology stocks, in particular, have
been known to plummet. He cited Cisco, which lost almost 90
percent from its 2000 high to the 2002 low, Bloomberg data show.  “Now that the stock is approaching the stratosphere, you
have to start thinking about what could happen if Apple hits a
difficult patch,” Bobroff said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
