Ternium SA (TX) , the second-largest
steelmaker in Latin America, fell to its lowest level in 21
months in New York trading after the company said second-half
operating profit will likely decline.  Ternium dropped 2.1 percent to $27.45 at 11:31 a.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, after earlier touching
$26.96, the lowest since Nov. 5, 2009.  Ternium, which announced today that second-quarter profit
rose 5.3 percent to $197.7 million, said operating income will
likely fall in the third and fourth quarters from the April-to-
June period as North American steel prices drop. Earnings will
also be hurt by higher costs for raw materials acquired in the
first half, it said.  Ternium doesn’t expect prices for raw materials, such as
 iron ore , to rise further in 2011 after having increased in the
first part of the year, Chief Financial Officer Pablo Brizzio
said in a conference call with investors today.  North America , which includes  Mexico , accounted for about
57 percent of Ternium’s revenue in 2010. Gerdau SA is Latin
America’s biggest steelmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
