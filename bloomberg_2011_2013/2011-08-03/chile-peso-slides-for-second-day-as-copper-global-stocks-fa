Chile ’s peso fell for a second day as
copper dropped to its lowest price in three weeks and global
stock markets tumbled, decreasing demand for riskier emerging-
market assets.  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 459.18 pesos per U.S.
dollar at 12:53 p.m. New York time, from 458.83 yesterday.  “The U.S., European and Chilean stock markets are falling
sharply,”  Osvaldo Cruz , an economist at Banco de Credito e
Inversiones, said in a telephone interview from Santiago.
“Copper has also dropped quite a bit, which is undoubtedly
affecting the peso’s losses today.”  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  slid for a ninth straight
day, losing 0.7 percent to an almost four-month low. The Stoxx
Europe 600 Index sank 2 percent. Chile’s benchmark IPSA index
tumbled 2.6 percent.  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, fell
1.6 percent on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on concern the
economy is stalling in the U.S., the world’s second-biggest user
of the metal.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 5.43 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
