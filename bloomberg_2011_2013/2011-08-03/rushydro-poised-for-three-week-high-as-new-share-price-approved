OAO RusHydro headed for its highest
level in three weeks after the board of  Russia â€™s biggest
producer of renewable energy approved the price of an additional
share issue at 1.65 rubles apiece, according to a regulatory
filing today.  The shares gained 1.6 percent to 1.39 rubles by 12:11 p.m.
in Moscow, snapping two days of losses. A close at that level
would be the strongest since July 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
