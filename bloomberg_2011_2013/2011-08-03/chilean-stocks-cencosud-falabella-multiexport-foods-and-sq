retailer by sales, fell 3.2 percent to 2,925 pesos, the biggest
intraday fall in six weeks. Chilean retailers had their price
estimates cut at Banchile-Citi, the joint research department of
Banco de  Chile  and Citigroup Inc., which cited local regulatory
concerns and the political scenario in  Peru .  SACI Falabella (FALAB)  , Chile’s largest retailer by
market value, retreated 3.1 percent to 4,280 pesos.  Multiexport Foods SA (MULTIFOO)  , a Chilean salmon
farmer, lost 4.3 percent to 155 pesos. Chile’s salmon production
may hit a record 550,000 tons in 2011, keeping prices low, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today.  Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile SA (SQM/B CC), Chile’s
largest fertilizer producer, fell 2.3 percent to 28,350 pesos.
Agricultural commodity prices fell today on slower economic
recovery speculation, which signals lower demand for SQM’s
products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
