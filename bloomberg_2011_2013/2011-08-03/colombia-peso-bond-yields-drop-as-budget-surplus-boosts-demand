Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to a nine-month low, as a widening budget surplus and
concerns over the European debt crisis boosted demand for the
higher-yielding securities.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 fell
for a 10th day, declining four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 7.56 percent at 2 p.m. New York time, according to the
stock exchange. That’s its lowest level on a closing basis since
Nov. 10. The bond’s price rose 0.362 centavo to 119.726 centavos
per peso.  “While the European debt crisis continues, in Colombia
what you have are improved fiscal indicators and this year’s
upgrade to investment grade,” said Camilo Contreras, an analyst
at Ultrabursatiles SA brokerage in Bogota. “That’s leading
investors to buy bonds in Colombia and other emerging markets
that offer better economic indicators and higher returns.”  Colombia’s government said in a July 22 report that its
first-quarter consolidated  budget surplus  widened to 1 percent
of gross domestic product from 0.1 percent of GDP a year
earlier.  Colombia’s foreign credit rating was upgraded to the lowest
level of investment grade by  Standard & Poor’s  in March, Moody’s
Investors Service in May and Fitch Ratings in June.  The peso was little changed at 1,770.83 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,770.88 yesterday. The peso has risen 7.7 percent so far
this year, the best performance among the six most-traded Latin
American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
