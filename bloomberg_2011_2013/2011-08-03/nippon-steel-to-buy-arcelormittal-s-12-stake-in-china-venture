Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) ,  Japan ’s largest
steelmaker, agreed to buy  ArcelorMittal (MT) ’s 12 percent stake in an
automotive-steel venture in China as demand for cars rises in
the world’s largest market.  The Japanese steelmaker will increase its stake in
Baosteel-NSC/Arcelor (BNA) Automotive Co. to 50 percent from 38
percent, Masato Suzuki, a spokesman for Tokyo-based Nippon Steel,
said by phone today, without giving the value of the deal.
Baoshan Iron & Steel Corp. will retain the remaining 50 percent
in the venture. The deal will need approval from Chinese
authorities, he said.  Total vehicle deliveries in China will grow about 5 percent
this year after surging 32 percent to a record in 2010,
according to the  China  Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
Baosteel-NSC/Arcelor, which started production in 2005, has a
capacity of 2.2 million tons a year.  “We’ve concluded to buy the stake as we expect stable
return from the venture, judging from a further growth in the
Chinese auto market,” Suzuki said.  Nippon Steel signed the agreement to buy the stake on June
27, the company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
