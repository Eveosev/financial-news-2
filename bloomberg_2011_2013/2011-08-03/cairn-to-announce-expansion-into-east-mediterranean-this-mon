Cairn Energy Plc (CNE) , the Scottish  oil
company  focusing on exploration off Greenland, will announce an
expansion of its operation in the  Mediterranean Sea  when it
reports first-half results on  Aug. 23 .  There is “one particular area in the eastern
Mediterranean” where Cairn is looking to form a partnership
with a “competitive big brand,” Mike Watts, deputy chief
executive officer, said on a conference call. He declined to
give details. “There are a number of things that we will look
at. It’s all about what fits with our strategy,” CEO Simon
Thompson also said on the same call.  Cairn plans to spend more than $1 billion to drill 10 wells
off Greenland in three years to 2013. The company today said it
plugged and abandoned an exploration well in the island waters.
The company, which has also been exploring for oil and gas  off
eastern Spain , disposed of assets off  Tunisia  in 2010 after
drilling an unsuccessful well.  David Nisbet, Ellie Goss and Louise Burgess , press officers
for Cairn at its Edinburgh headquarters, weren’t available for
comment when calls were placed to their office and each of their
cell phones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
