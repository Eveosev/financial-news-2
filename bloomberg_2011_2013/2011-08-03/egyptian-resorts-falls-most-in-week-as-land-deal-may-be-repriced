Egyptian Resorts Co. (EGTS) , a Red Sea
resorts developer, fell the most in more than a week after  Al
Mal  said an Egyptian government agency may reprice land
purchased by the company.  Shares of the Cairo-based developer retreated as much as
3.5 percent, the most since July 25, before trading 0.9 percent
lower at 1.13 Egyptian pounds at 12:41 p.m. in Cairo. That gave
the company a market value of 1.19 billion pounds ($199
million). The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  declined 1.2 percent.  Egypt’s Tourism Development Authority plans to raise the
value of 20 million square meters (215 million square feet) of
land the government earlier agreed to sell to Egyptian Resorts
Co.,  Al Mal  reported, citing unidentified persons at the agency.
The value of the land will be revised to $175 million from $30
million, the newspaper said.  Egyptian Resorts didn’t receive any notification from the
agency regarding its plans to re-price the land, the company
said in a filing to the bourse today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
