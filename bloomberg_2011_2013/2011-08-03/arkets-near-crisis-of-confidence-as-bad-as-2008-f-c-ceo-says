Markets are experiencing a crisis of
confidence almost as bad as in 2008 as liquidity evaporates amid
the European and U.S. debt crises,  F&C Asset Management Plc (FCAM) 
Chief Executive Officer Alain Grisay said.  “Markets are incredibly difficult,” he told reporters on
a conference call today as the London-based  fund manager  posted
a smaller first-half loss. We are “as close as possible” to a
repeat of the turmoil of 2008, he said. “We are seeing a crisis
of confidence and a drying up of liquidity.”  Yields on Spanish and Italian government bonds are now
higher than they were before the second Greek bailout and there
is little growth in the U.K., he said. This week’s agreement to
lift the U.S. debt ceiling was only temporary and won’t solve
the long-term structural issues facing the U.S., he said.  “There is a shift in perception of quality away from the
developed world to what were known as emerging markets,” Grisay
said. “People are assessing where they want to take risk and
how they want to be rewarded.”  F&C’s first-half loss narrowed to 20 million pounds ($32.8
million) from 20.3 million pounds in year-earlier period, the
firm said in a statement today. Revenue rose 28 percent to 137
million pounds on the acquisition of hedge-fund Thames River
Capital LLP. Underlying pretax profit rose 55 percent to 22.6
million pounds, the company said.  F&C fell 1.05 pence, or 1.6 percent, to 65 pence in London
trading, the lowest since October 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
