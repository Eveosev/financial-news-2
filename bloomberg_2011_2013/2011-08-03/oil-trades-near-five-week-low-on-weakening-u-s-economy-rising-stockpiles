Oil traded near a five-week low in
 New York  as investors bet that increasing stockpiles and signs
of a slowing economy in the U.S. indicate fuel demand will
falter in the world’s biggest crude-consuming nation.  Futures were little changed after falling for a fourth day
yesterday. U.S.  service industries  expanded in July at the
slowest pace in 17 months as orders and employment cooled. Crude
inventories last week rose 950,000 barrels to 354.9 million.
Labor Department reports today and tomorrow may show the U.S.
failing to create enough jobs to reduce unemployment.  “The main driver is the economy,” said Sean Brodrick, a
natural resource analyst with  Weiss Research  in Jupiter,
 Florida . “If the  U.S. economy  is slowing, the easiest path for
oil is lower. We’ll soon be testing support just below $90.”  Crude for September delivery was at $92.20 a barrel, up 27
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 9:10 a.m. Sydney time. The contract yesterday dropped $1.86
to $91.93, the lowest since June 27. Prices are 12 percent
higher the past year.  Brent oil for September settlement declined $3.23, or 2.8
percent, to $113.23 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange yesterday. The European benchmark contract
settled at a $21.30 premium to U.S. futures, compared with a
record close of $22.67 on Aug. 2.  Service Industries  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of the
economy, dropped to 52.7 from 53.3 in June. Economists projected
53.5 for July, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  Oil also dropped after the  Department of Energy  reported
the gain in U.S. crude stockpiles. Gasoline inventories rose 1.7
million barrels to 215.2 million, the highest level since April
1. They were forecast to climb 250,000 barrels, according to a
Bloomberg News survey.  Supplies of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, increased 409,000 barrels to 152.3
million, the Energy Department report shows. They were forecast
to rise 1.5 million barrels, according to the survey.  A Labor Department report today may show initial U.S.
jobless claims climbed last week. A report tomorrow may show
payrolls increased by 85,000 workers in July after an 18,000
increase in June that was the smallest this year, according to
the median forecast of 86 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
