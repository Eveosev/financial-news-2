Iran ’s economic growth has
accelerated and cuts in subsidies have been achieved without
sharp increases in inflation, improving the outlook for further
gains, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  Growth accelerated to 3.2 percent in 2010-2011 from 0.6
percent two years earlier, the IMF said in a  report  published
today. The inflation rate only rose by about 4 percentage points
in the first five months of this year, to 14.2 percent, even
after subsidies for energy and food were scrapped, it said.  The government in December began handing out monthly cash
payments, targeted at the poorest Iranians, to replace the
subsidies. Prices in Tehran’s traditional bakeries have
increased by at least 25 percent and gasoline prices have
multiplied by four.  The measures will remove as much as $60 billion in
subsidies, or 15 percent of Iran’s gross domestic product, the
IMF said. That will “increase the efficiency and
competitiveness of the economy, improve  income distribution ,
reduce poverty and help Iran unlock its full growth potential,”
the IMF said.  Iran proceeded with the plan to roll back three-decade-old
subsidies as pressure mounted over the past year from four
rounds of United Nations sanctions and measures from the U.S.
and the European Union aimed at curbing the country’s nuclear
program. The punishments include restrictions on trade related
to Iran’s oil and gas industries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
