Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle
Mike Patterson is in stable condition after collapsing at
practice today at Lehigh University.  Patterson, 27, fell to the ground between drills at
training camp this morning in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania , and
suffered a seizure that lasted for about four minutes, the
National Football League team said on its  website . Patterson
briefly lost consciousness, the Eagles said.  The 6-foot-1, 300-pound Patterson was stabilized by the
Eagles’ training staff, then placed on a stretcher and taken by
ambulance to Lehigh Valley Hospital.  “He’s absolutely alert, stable, totally communicating with
everybody to the point that he’s joking a little bit,” Eagles
trainer Rick Burkholder told reporters. “We won’t speculate
what happened to him other than that he had a seizure. They’ll
do all the testing at Lehigh Valley Hospital to determine why he
had the seizure.”  Patterson was the Eagles’ first-round pick in the NFL’s
2005 draft and has started 77 of 80 games over the past five
seasons. Burkholder said there’s nothing in Patterson’s medical
history that indicates he’s predisposed to seizures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
