Tour de France  champion Cadel Evans
will parade through Melbourne next week to celebrate becoming
the first Australian to win cycling’s most-prestigious race.  Evans, 34, will ride through downtown Melbourne on Aug. 12
before being presented at Federation Square, where the public
will be encouraged to “yell for Cadel,” the Victoria state
government said today in a statement.  “Cadel is coming home especially for this event,” Ted Baillieu, the Premier of Victoria, said in the statement.  Evans, who became the third non-European to win the 108-
year-old Tour de France after  Greg LeMond  and  Lance Armstrong  of
the U.S., hadn’t been scheduled to return to Australia until the
end of October after the European cycling season ends.  He splits his time between bases in  Switzerland  and Barwon
Heads, a coastal town about 40 miles (65 kilometers) southwest
of Melbourne.  “It will be my first time home during the season for a
while,” Evans said on his website.  His next scheduled race is the inaugural USA Pro Cycling
Challenge in Colorado, a seven-stage event starting Aug. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
