South Korea , the world’s fifth-
largest crude oil importer, said exports of petroleum products
rose 72 percent in the first half of this year as demand from
 Japan  and other Asian countries increased.  Exports climbed to $24.47 billion in the six months ended
June 30, the third-largest contributor to the nation’s total
overseas sales, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said in an e-
mailed  statement  today. Exports of petroleum products are
equivalent to 53 percent of South Korea’s imported crude by
value, and 47 percent of its imported crude by volume.  South Korea’s imports of crude oil rose 9 percent by volume
during the period, “which was mainly to meet rising demand for
overseas sales,” the ministry said. Exports of petroleum
products rose 21 percent by volume.  The nation imported 459.3 million barrels of crude oil in
the first half, of which 86 percent came from  Saudi Arabia ,
Kuwait and four other nations in the  Middle East .  Domestic consumption of petroleum products fell 2.2 percent
from a year earlier as high product prices damped consumption.
While domestic use of gasoline and diesel products fell, those
of naphtha and jet fuel climbed because of demand from
petrochemical companies and airliners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
