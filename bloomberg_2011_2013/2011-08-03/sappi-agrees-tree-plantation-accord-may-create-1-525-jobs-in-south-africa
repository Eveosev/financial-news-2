Sappi Ltd. (SAP) , the world’s largest maker
of glossy paper, said the closure of its Adamas paper mill in
 South Africa  this month will result in costs of about $5 million
in the fiscal fourth quarter.  The shutdown of the “high cost” mill, in the Eastern Cape
province city of  Port Elizabeth , will eliminate about 40,000
tons from Sappi’s 1 million tons of capacity in southern  Africa ,
Andre Oberholzer, the company’s corporate affairs manager, said
today by phone from the manufacturer’s  Johannesburg
headquarters.  Rising raw-material and power costs put pressure on the 47-
year-old Adamas plant, which had a 213-employee workforce, Sappi
said in a statement. The site will shut permanently by the end
of August, the company said. Helsinki-based competitors  Stora
Enso Oyj (STERV)  and UPM Kymmene Oyj are among paper producers that have
closed mills as weaker sales led to a glut.  “There is still high-cost capacity out there globally that
over time has to fall by the wayside,” Oberholzer said.  Sappi fell 1.9 percent to 28.85 rand, the lowest price
since May 28, 2010, as of the 5 p.m. close of trading in
Johannesburg. The stock has dropped 15 percent this year,
valuing the company at 15 billion rand ($2.2 billion).  ‘Battling’  “This is a business that has really been battling, with
profits under pressure from a relatively strong rand and rising
costs,”  David Shapiro , a director at the Johannesburg-based
Sasfin Securities, said by phone. Sappi has production costs in
euros and rand, while sales are denominated in the dollar.  Sappi has a proposal with the provincial branch of the
AgriSA farmers association to accelerate the development of
30,000 hectares (74,100 acres) of commercial tree plantations in
Eastern Cape by 2020, the company also said. The project will
create as many as 1,400 unskilled jobs and 125 positions for
skilled workers, it said.  The company is scheduled to report earnings tomorrow for
the fiscal third quarter ended June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
