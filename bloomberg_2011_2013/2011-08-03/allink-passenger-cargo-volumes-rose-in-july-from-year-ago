AS Tallink Grupp, the largest Baltic
ferry company, carried more passengers and cargo in July than a
year earlier, helped mainly by an increase on the Tallinn-
Helsinki route.  Passenger volumes rose 6.1 percent and the number of cargo
units increased 5.5 percent from a year earlier, the Tallinn-
based company said in a regulatory statement today. Tallink
carried 9.6 percent more passengers and 9.3 percent more cargo
between the Estonian and Finnish capitals, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
