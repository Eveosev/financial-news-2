Transurban Group (TCL) ,  Australia ’s biggest
operator of toll roads by market value, said full-year profit
rose 89 percent as traffic volumes on its Melbourne and Sydney
roads increased.  Net income was A$112.5 million ($121.2 million) in the year
ended June 30, from A$59.4 million a year earlier, the
Melbourne-based company said in a statement today. Toll revenue
rose 10 percent from a year ago to A$891 million.  The Australian toll-road industry is consolidating with the
agreement by Transurban’s biggest shareholder CP2 Ltd. last
month to buy rival  ConnectEast Group. (CEU)  The Canada Pension Plan
Investment Board agreed last year to buy Intoll Group, another
of Transurban’s rivals, for A$3.44 billion.  Both takeovers followed Transurban’s rejection of a joint
bid by the groups to buy the company for A$7.2 billion last year.
Transurban shares yesterday closed at A$5.11, 8.3 percent below
the takeover offer of A$5.57 a share.  Transurban will raise its final distribution to 14
Australian cents, taking its full-year payout to 27 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
