Egypt ’s stocks fell to the lowest in
almost three months as trading volume dropped after investors
tuned into the trial of former President  Hosni Mubarak .  The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  fell 0.9 percent to 4,923.29,
the lowest level since May 8, at the 1:30 p.m. close in Cairo.
Trading volume fell to 63.8 million, the lowest in a week, while
the value of shares traded was about 234 million Egyptian pounds
($39 million), the lowest since December 2008.  Orascom Telecom
Holding SAE (ORTE) , North Africa’s biggest publicly traded mobile
networks operator, fell to the lowest level since March.  “The trial grabbed everyone’s attention,” said Ashraf
Akhnoukh, senior equity sales trader at Cairo-based Commercial
International Brokerage. "Future sessions should see relatively
higher activity, but Ramadan, summer and the lack of a catalyst
should keep interest in the market low in the coming period.’’  Mubarak was wheeled into a Cairo court on a hospital bed
today and charged with conspiracy to kill some of the protesters
who drove him from office in February. He denied all charges.
The trial session covered the entire three-hour trading session
on the Egyptian Exchange.  Orascom Telecom lost 3.5 percent to 3.63 Egyptian pounds.
 Egyptian Resorts Co. (EGTS) , a Red Sea resorts developer, declined 1.8
percent, the most in more than a week, to 1.12 pounds. Egypt’s
Tourism Development Authority may reprice 20 million square
meters (215 million square feet) of land purchased by the
company to $175 million from $30 million,  Al Mal  newspaper
reported. Egyptian Resorts said it didn’t receive notification
of the agency’s plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
