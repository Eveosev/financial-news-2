Immofinanz AG (IIA) , eastern  Europe ’s
biggest property company by assets, plans to pay its first
dividend since 2007 after profit almost quadrupled last year,
beating analyst estimates. The shares rose the most in two
weeks.  Immofinanz, based in Vienna, will pay a dividend of 10
cents a share for fiscal 2011, according to a statement after
the market closed yesterday. Net income for the 12 months ended
April 30 rose to 315.8 million euros ($448 million) from 80.8
million euros a year earlier, Immofinanz said. Four analysts in
a Bloomberg survey made an average forecast of 290.5 million
euros.  The Austrian company with projects including the GoodZone
mall in Moscow and the Gerling Quarter in Cologne,  Germany ,
scrapped its dividend for fiscal 2008 after global credit crisis
roiled real-estate markets. The last dividend, in 2007, amounted
to 33 cents a share.  Immofinanz climbed 13 percent in Vienna trading, the
biggest gain since July 21, rising to 2.57 euros at the 5:30
p.m. close of trading. That reduced the decline for this year to
19 percent, the second-worst performance among stocks in the 22-
member Stoxx 600 Real Estate index, which has fallen 2.2
percent.  Quarterly Profit  Immofinanz earned 83.9 million euros in the fourth quarter
compared with a loss of 24.8 million euros a year earlier,
according to yesterday’s statement. Net asset value rose to 5.36
euros a share, if potential dilution due to convertible bonds is
taken into account. Diluted NAV was 5.13 a share three months
earlier.  Eduard Zehetner was appointed chief executive officer in
2009 to restructure Immofinanz after a cash squeeze. The company
has since merged with eastern Europe unit Immoeast AG, put
developments on ice, settled disputes with former affiliates,
sold assets to restore cash reserves and refinanced bonds that
may have come due next year.  Zehetner today reiterated that he planned to raise the
dividend for fiscal 2012 to 15 cents a share and the payout for
the following year to 20 cents. Earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization will rise to 600 million euros in
2013, he forecast.  Immofinanz, which competes with companies including  Atrium
European Real Estate Ltd. (ATRS)  and  CA Immobilien Anlagen AG (CAI) , plans to
sell 2.5 billion euros of assets by 2014. The company is
shedding properties outside of Germany,  Austria  and the six
eastern European countries it’s now focusing on, and is
reinvesting the funds there. Immofinanz is also trying to reduce
the proportion of jointly owned assets by buying out partners
and making disposals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
