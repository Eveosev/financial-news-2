The U.S.’s main difficulty at the
moment is a deficit in jobs and growth rather than an excessive
 budget deficit , said  Lawrence Summers , a former Treasury
Secretary and now a professor at Harvard.  Writing in the Financial Times, Summers said current policy
means there will be a big withdrawal of fiscal stimulus when
payroll tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and it would be
surprising if growth were fast enough even to bring unemployment
down to 8.5 percent by the end of 2012.  The  U.S. economy  is close to stalling and there’s a
prospect of adverse shocks from a European financial crisis that
hasn’t been brought under control; the chances are at least one
in three that the country will slip back into recession if no
new steps are taken to boost demand and growth, he said.  President Barack Obama must make clear that he won’t accept
any extension of Bush-era cuts in taxes on high incomes, and
it’s essential that demand be spurred by extending the payroll
tax cut and by further measures such as infrastructure
maintenance and unemployment insurance extension, Summers
concluded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
