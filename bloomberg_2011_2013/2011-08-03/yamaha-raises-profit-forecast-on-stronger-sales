Yamaha Motor Co., the worldâ€™s second-
largest motorcycle maker, increased its full-year profit
forecast by 75 percent, citing stronger sales in markets
including  Latin America .  The Iwata City, Japan-based company today raised its profit
forecast for the year ending Dec. 31 to 35 billion yen ($453
million) from an earlier estimate of 20 billion yen. Yamaha is
forecasting net income to almost double from 18.3 billion yen

Dividend payout ratio will not be lower than 20 percent and the
company is targeting to post operating margin of 5 percent in
2012, he said.  Net income for the three months ended June 30 was 15.5
billion yen, compared with 16.3 billion yen a year earlier,
