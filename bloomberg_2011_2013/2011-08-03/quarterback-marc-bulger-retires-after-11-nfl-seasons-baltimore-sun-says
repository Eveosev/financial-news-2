Quarterback Marc Bulger is retiring
after an 11-year National Football League career in which he
made the Pro Bowl twice, the Baltimore Sun  reported  on its
website.  Bulger, 34, was a backup to Joe Flacco last season for the
Baltimore Ravens and didn’t appear in any regular-season games.
Bulger decided not to pursue offers he received from other teams
this offseason, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified
person in the NFL familiar with the situation.  Bulger’s retirement would leave Tyrod Taylor and Hunter
Cantwell as possible backups for Flacco, who hasn’t missed a
start in his three NFL seasons.  Bulger played in  St. Louis  from 2002 to 2009 and passed for
22,814 yards, 122 touchdowns and 93 interceptions. Bulger became
the Rams’ starter in 2003 after an injury to Kurt Warner and
made the  Pro Bowl  after throwing for 3,845 yards and 22
touchdowns, leading the team to a 12-4 record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
