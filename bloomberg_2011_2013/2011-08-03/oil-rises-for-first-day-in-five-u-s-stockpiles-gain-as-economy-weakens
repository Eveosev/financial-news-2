Oil traded near the lowest in more
than five weeks as concern the economic recovery is faltering in
the U.S., the biggest crude consumer, countered speculation the
 Federal Reserve  may start another stimulus program.  New York futures were little changed after reports
yesterday showed U.S. service industries expanded in July at the
slowest pace in 17 months and crude stockpiles climbed for a
second week. Three former senior officials at the Fed said the
central bank should consider a new round of securities purchases
to bolster economic growth, the Wall Street Journal reported.  “Market participants seem to be concerned about growth
prospects in the U.S.,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and
energy economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in  Melbourne ,
who predicts crude will average $98 a barrel in the third
quarter. Reports of stimulus “may give a short-term reprieve to
prices and forecast demand but if these weak numbers keep coming
out it’s going to swamp any positive sentiment around further
quantitative easing,” he said.  Crude for September delivery was at $91.84 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , down 9
cents, at 3:22 p.m. Singapore time. The contract earlier rose as
much as 66 cents and fell 42 cents. Yesterday, it dropped $1.86
to $91.93, the lowest since June 27. Futures have gained 11
percent the past year.  Brent oil for September settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange traded at $113.32 a barrel, down 4
cents. The European benchmark contract was at a $21.53 premium
to U.S. futures, after reaching a record $22.67 on Aug. 2.  U.S. Stockpiles  U.S. crude inventories rose 950,000 barrels in the week
ended July 29 to 354.9 million, an Energy Department report
showed yesterday.  Gasoline stockpiles climbed 1.7 million barrels to 215.2
million, the highest since April 1. Supplies were forecast to
increase 250,000 barrels, based on the median estimate from
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Distillate fuel
inventories, a category that includes heating oil and diesel,
increased 409,000 barrels to 152.3 million.  Crude in  New York  may rebound after prices reached
technical support along the lower Bollinger Band yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This indicator is at
$90.62 a barrel today and the next level, the middle Bollinger
Band, is at $95.84. Prices tend to change direction when they
fail to breach chart support or resistance.  Manufacturing  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of the
economy, dropped to 52.7 from 53.3 in June. A median increase to
53.5 was forecast by economists polled by Bloomberg News.
Readings above 50 signal expansion.  A Labor Department report today may show initial U.S.
jobless claims climbed last week. A report tomorrow may show
payrolls increased by 85,000 workers in July after an 18,000
increase in June that was the smallest this year, according to
the median forecast of 86 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Tropical Storm Emily moved west, pouring rain over the
Caribbean island of Hispaniola, resuming a course that may
threaten the U.S. East Coast this weekend, the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said.  Emily packed maximum sustained winds of 50 miles (80
kilometers) per hour, according to an advisory posted by the
center before 11 p.m. New York time. The center of the storm may
cross Haiti and the  Dominican Republic  today, bringing heavy
rain and causing deadly flooding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
