The  African Development Bank  set
aside $500 million to help  Zimbabwe  clear its debt with the
lender, the state-controlled  Herald  said, citing the bank.  The debt-clearance facility will only be granted if
Zimbabwe implements unspecified economic policies by the end of
this year, the Harare-based Herald said on its website. The
country needs $14.2 billion to rehabilitate its road, water and
power systems, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
