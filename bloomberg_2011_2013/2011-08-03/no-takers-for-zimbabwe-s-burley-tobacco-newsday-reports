Burley tobacco growers in  Zimbabwe 
can’t find buyers for all their crop,  Newsday  reported, citing
Andrew Matibiri, chief executive officer of the Tobacco Industry
and Marketing Board, the crop’s regulator.  Closely-held Boka Tobacco Auction Floors (Private) Ltd. is
seeking funds to buy about 3,000 bales of burley leaf sitting at
its premises, the Harare-based newspaper said on its website
today. Buyers have focused on the country’s better-known flue-
cured or  Virginia  tobacco, Newsday said.  Burley tobacco, grown mainly by small-scale farmers, is
cured in open-air barns, while flue-cured tobacco, also known as
Virginia, is cured in heated and sealed barns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
