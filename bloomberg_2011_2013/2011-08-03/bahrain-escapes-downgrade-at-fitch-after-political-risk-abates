Bahrain’s creditworthiness escaped a
possible downgrade at  Fitch Ratings  because of reduced near-term
political and economic risks in the island-kingdom that
contended with anti-government protests earlier this year.  Fitch said it removed the Persian Gulf kingdom from its
Credit Watch Negative list for borrowers facing a possible
downgrade. Bahrain’s long-term foreign-currency issuer default
rating was affirmed at BBB, the second-lowest investment grade,
and its local-currency issuer default rating at BBB+.  “The resolution of the Rating Watch Negative and
affirmation of the rating reflects Fitch’s view that the near-
term risks to the political and economic outlook have abated
following the lifting of the state of emergency on 1 June,” the
rating company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Protesters, mostly members of Bahrain’s Shiite Muslim
majority, revolted in February against the island’s Sunni
rulers, demanding more political representation. A Saudi
Arabian-led military force from the Gulf Cooperation Council
helped the government quell the uprising, which was inspired by
revolts that swept the Arab world this year and forced the
ouster of the leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt .  Moody’s Investors Service lowered Bahrain’s credit rating
one level in May to Baa1, the third-lowest investment grade,
from A3 with a negative outlook. On July 20, Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services affirmed Bahrain’s long- and short-term local
and foreign-currency sovereign credit ratings at BBB/A-3 with
negative implications and removed the country from CreditWatch
negative.  To contact the reporters on this story:
