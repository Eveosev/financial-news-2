The German government agreed to
increase investment in clean-energy technology research by about
75 percent as Europe’s largest power market prepares to exit
nuclear generation by 2022.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Cabinet will pump 3.4 billion
euros ($4.9 billion) into renewables,  energy efficiency , energy
storage and grid-technology research in the next three years,
the Environment Ministry said today in an e-mailed statement.  “We need innovative and efficient energy technologies to
make the path into the age of renewable-energy sources safe and
affordable,” Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said in the
statement.  Merkel said in June she will replace Germany’s 17 reactors
with a combination of renewable sources and fossil-fuel-based
 power plants , after explosions at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear
complex stoked safety concerns in Europe’s largest economy.  Germany’s atomic power stations accounted for 23 percent of
the nation’s generating capacity last year. The country met 16.8
percent of its electricity needs from renewable sources, and
aims to boost that to at least 35 percent in 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
