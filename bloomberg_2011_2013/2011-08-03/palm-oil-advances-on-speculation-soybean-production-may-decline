Palm oil  advanced to its highest
level in almost two weeks on speculation that demand for the
tropical oil may increase as hot weather erodes conditions for
the U.S. soybean crop.  The October-delivery contract climbed as much as 0.9
percent to 3,140 ringgit ($1,055) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the highest since July 22. It ended the
morning session at 3,137 ringgit.  Soybeans had the biggest gain in almost three weeks
yesterday after a U.S. Department of Agriculture report showed
the condition of the U.S. crop worsened last week amid continued
hot, dry weather across the Midwest. About 60 percent of the
soybean crop in the top 18 producing states was in good or
excellent condition as of July 31, down from 62 percent a week
earlier, the USDA said in an Aug. 1 report.  The forecast for smaller U.S. soybean output is making
“palm oil more attractive,” Vijay Mehta, director at Commodity
Links Pte, said by phone from  Singapore  today. “Palm oil has
good demand at these prices, it’s still cheaper compared to
 soybean oil .”  Soybean oil’s premium over palm oil was at $215.57 a ton
today, compared with an average of $142.44 a ton this year,
according to Bloomberg data.  Weather Risks  Soybean futures declined as much as 0.3 percent to $13.75 a
bushel today, after gaining 17.75 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
$13.7975 a bushel yesterday, the biggest gain since July 13.  “There are still weather vagaries,” in the U.S., said
Paramalingam Subramaniam, director of Kuala Lumpur-based
brokerage Pelindung Bestari Sdn. “The full brunt of the U.S.
weather will not be felt until the second half of August.”  This July was the hottest since 1955 in the central and
eastern U.S. with average temperatures 3 degrees to 7 degrees
Fahrenheit higher than normal, according to MDA Information
Systems Inc. Corn and soybean output in the U.S., the world’s
largest producer and exporter, will fall below government
forecasts, INTL FCStone Inc., a commodity research and brokerage
company, said yesterday.  High Temperatures  Grain and oilseed prices increased last month as hot, dry
weather in the Midwest eroded crop prospects. The soybean
harvest will fall to 3.145 billion bushels, less than the 3.225
billion forecast by the USDA, INTL FCStone said in a report. The
yield will be 42.4 bushels an acre, below the government’s
estimate of 43.4 bushels.  Soybean oil for December delivery fell as much as 0.8
percent to 57.40 cents per pound in  Chicago . Palm oil and
soybean oil are substitutes in food and fuel uses.  Palm oil for May delivery rose as much as 0.8 percent to
9,298 yuan ($1,444) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  and
soybean oil for delivery in the same month gained as much as 0.7
percent to 10,404 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
