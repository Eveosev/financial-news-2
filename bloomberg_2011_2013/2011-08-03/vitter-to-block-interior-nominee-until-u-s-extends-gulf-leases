Senator  David Vitter , a Louisiana
Republican, said he will block confirmation of an Interior
Department official until the U.S. extends leases for Gulf of
Mexico oil exploration.  Vitter will prevent Rebecca Wodder from becoming assistant
secretary for fish and wildlife and parks until the owners of
all the leases expiring this year are given extra time to
compensate for delays tied to last year’s  BP Plc (BP/)  oil spill, said
his spokesman, Luke Bolar.  The Interior Department on June 29 issued a  notice  to lease
holders with instructions for seeking more time on the Gulf
leases. The administration hasn’t declined any requests for
extensions so far, Melissa Schwartz, a spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail.  Vitter wants a “blanket” extension, without any further
action required by lease holders, Bolar said.  BP, based in London, is the top leaseholder in the Gulf,
followed by San Ramon, California-based  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , Irving,
Texas-based Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc of The
Hague.  To contact the reporter on this story:
