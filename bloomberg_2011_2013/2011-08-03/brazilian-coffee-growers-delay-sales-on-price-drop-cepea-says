Coffee growers in  Brazil , the world’s
largest producer, are delaying sales of this year’s crop as bean
prices fall in  New York  trading, according to Cepea, a
University of Sao Paulo research group.  Growers in Espirito Santo, Brazil’s largest robusta-
producing state, have picked 90 percent of the crop and sold
about 30 percent, Cepea said in a report dated yesterday, citing
local agents. In southern  Minas Gerais , the main arabica-
producing state, 75 percent of the crop has been harvested,
while sales remain between 25 and 30 percent, it said.  “In the main coffee-producing regions in Brazil, the
harvesting of robusta and arabica varieties remains at a good
pace, favored by good weather conditions,” Cepea analyst
Margarete Boteon said in the report. “In spite of that, trades
in the Brazilian market are sluggish” as sellers hold back
beans, expecting a new advance in prices, she said.  Arabica dropped 7.3 percent over the past month on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York on reduced concerns a frost might hurt
crops in Brazil. Robusta slid 14 percent in  London  in the same
span as stockpiles at European warehouses monitored by the NYSE
Liffe exchange almost doubled this year.  “Due to decreases in the international market, which
pressed down quotes in Brazil, most sellers refrained from
trading,” Boteon said in the report.  Robusta for September delivery rose $15, or 0.7 percent, to
$2,135 a ton by 9:32 a.m. London time. Arabica for delivery in
the same month climbed 1.3 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.445 a
pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
