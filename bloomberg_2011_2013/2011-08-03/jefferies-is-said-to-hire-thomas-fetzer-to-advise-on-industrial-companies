Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  hired Thomas Fetzer, a  UBS AG (UBSN)  managing director in London, to advise European
industrial equipment companies, said two people familiar with
the matter.  Fetzer, who joined Jefferies this week, will be based in
Frankfurt, said one of the people, who declined to be identified
because the information isn’t public. Tom Tarrant, a spokesman
for Jefferies in New York, declined to comment, as did Richard Morton, a spokesman for UBS in London.  Benjamin Lorello, Jefferies’ global head of investment
banking and capital markets, has built out his overseas
workforce in the past year, hiring Peter Bacchus from Morgan
Stanley and Dominic Lester from UBS as joint heads of European
 investment banking . The New York-based firm, led by Chairman
Richard Handler, has sought to expand as larger competitors cut
employees following the 2008 credit crisis.  The investment-banking arm of UBS, Switzerland’s largest
bank, has faced management changes and departures in Europe and
the U.S. since 2008, when the bank cut its bonus pool by 80
percent. Pat Guerin, the bank’s co-head of mergers and
acquisitions in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, agreed in
March to join Citigroup Inc., and the other co-head, Liam Beere,
left for U.S. firm Moelis & Co. in June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
