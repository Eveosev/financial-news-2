U.K. government bonds rose, pushing
the 10-year gilt yield to a record low, as global stock markets
slumped amid mounting concern that economic growth is faltering.  The two-year yield dropped to the lowest since October as
the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  dropped 0.9 percent and the Stoxx Europe 600
slid 0.4 percent. The pound strengthened against the dollar and
Swiss franc as a report showed U.K. services growth unexpectedly
accelerated, though it stayed lower versus the euro.  “There are intensifying flight-to-quality flows supporting
gilts,” said  Matteo Regesta , a senior interest-rate strategist
at BNP Paribas SA in London. “Equities are weak and  risk
aversion  is rising. There seems to be no catalyst in sight that
could fade the current  market sentiment .”  The yield on the 10-year gilt fell two basis points to 2.75
percent as of 4:26 p.m. in London after dropping as low as 2.71
percent. The 3.75 percent security due September 2020 rose 0.21,
or 2.1 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,640) face amount, to 108.07.
The two-year gilt yield was little changed at 0.63 percent after
reaching 0.57 percent.  Gilts have handed investors a return of 5.8 percent this
year, compared with 3.7 percent for German bunds and 5.3 percent
for U.S. Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Pound Gains  The pound gained 0.6 percent to $1.6402. It dropped to
$1.6224 yesterday, the lowest level since July 21. Sterling
slipped 0.1 percent to 87.24 pence per euro after reaching 86.95
pence earlier, the strongest since May 31.  The British currency gained as much as 2.8 percent to
1.2767 francs, recovering from a record low, as  Switzerland ’s
central bank threatened to move against the franc’s strength.  A gauge based on a survey of services companies rose to
55.4 from 53.9 in June, Markit Economics and the Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply said in an e-mailed report in
London. That compares with a median forecast of 27 economists in
a Bloomberg News survey of a decline to 53.2.  “The fact that the pound is not strengthening against the
euro shows that the PMI data is not something to get too excited
about,” said  Paul Robinson , head of global foreign-exchange
research at Barclays Plc in London. “Its biggest move today is
of course against the Swiss, down to the comments from the  Swiss
National Bank .”  Sterling has fallen 8.5 percent in the last 12 months,
making it the second-worst performer among 10 developed-market
currencies after the  U.S. dollar , according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  Economic Data  The pound has swung between gains and losses this week as
investors assess whether economic data is so weak that policy
makers will keep borrowing costs lower for longer.  Bank of England  policy makers meet to set  interest rates 
tomorrow, and will keep the key rate unchanged at 0.5 percent,
according to all 55 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Britain’s economy will grow less than previously forecast
this year and the government should cut taxes to boost the
recovery, the National Institute for Economic and Social
Research said.  Gross domestic product will rise 1.3 percent this year,
compared with an April forecast of 1.4 percent, Niesr, whose
clients include the U.K. Treasury and the Bank of England, said
today. Growth will accelerate to 2 percent in 2012, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
