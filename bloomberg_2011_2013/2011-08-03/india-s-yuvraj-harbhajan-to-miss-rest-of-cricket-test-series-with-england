Batsman  Yuvraj Singh  and bowler
 Harbhajan Singh  will miss the rest of India’s Test cricket
series against England with injuries.  Yuvraj has a fractured left index finger and will be out
about four weeks, while Harbhajan’s strained abdominal muscle
will sideline him three weeks, the Board of Control for Cricket
in India said in a  statement  on its website.  They will be replaced by batsman Virat Kohli and spinner
Pragyan Ojha, the BCCI said.  India has lost the first two games in the four-Test series,
which resumes Aug. 10 at Edgbaston in Birmingham. The final Test
is Aug. 18-22 at the Oval in London.  Fast-bowler  Zaheer Khan  and opener Gautam Gambhir both
missed the last Test with injuries and their status for the
third game isn’t yet known. Opening batsman  Virender Sehwag , who
hasn’t played since having shoulder surgery in May, will join
the team in England today.  England can replace India as No. 1 in the International
Cricket Council  rankings  with another victory or by drawing the
final two matches. The teams will also play one Twenty20 match
and five one-day international games following the Test series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
