Drake Oil Co., a Nigeria energy
company, signed a memorandum of understanding with South Korean
SK Engineering and Construction Group to invest $5.5 billion in
gas and power projects,  ThisDay  reported, citing Drakeâ€™s
chairman, Sam Dede.  The deal includes a gas-to-liquid plant which will be
located in the southern Rivers State, and a 30,000 metric-ton

state, the Lagos-based newspaper said. The liquefied gas plant
is expected to be completed within nine months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
