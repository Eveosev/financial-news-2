The Torm Estrid vessel was hired to
store gasoil at sea, according to Torm A/S,  Europe ’s largest
publicly traded shipper of refined oil products.  The Torm Estrid, a long range tanker, was booked for a
period of up to 90 days to store the refined oil cargo off the
West African coast, Tina Revsbech, senior vice-president, said
by e-mail today.  “This kind of storage off West Africa is not unusual or
new,” Revsbech said.  Torm did not disclose the charterer and daily rate, citing
confidentiality. The Torm Estrid has a carrying capacity of
75,000 deadweight tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
