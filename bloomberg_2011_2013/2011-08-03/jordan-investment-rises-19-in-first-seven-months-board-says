Investment in Jordan rose 19 percent
in the first seven months of this year to 1.25 billion dinars
($1.76 billion), the state-run Jordan Investment Board said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the  Middle East ,
imports more than 90 percent of its oil and relies on foreign
investment and grants to support its budget and current-account
deficits.  The government is hoping to boost investment and is seeking
to join the Gulf Cooperation Council, the regional group of six
energy-rich monarchies led by  Saudi Arabia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
