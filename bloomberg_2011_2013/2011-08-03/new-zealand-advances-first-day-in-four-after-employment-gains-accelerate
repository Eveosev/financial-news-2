Australia ’s currency declined for a
sixth day against the  U.S. dollar  as signs that growth in the
South Pacific nation is slowing prompted traders to bet the
central bank is likely to cut  interest rates  in October.  New Zealand ’s dollar dropped the most in more than five
months against the greenback on a closing basis as Asian stocks
declined for a third day. Both South Pacific dollars climbed
against the yen after Japan intervened in the foreign-exchange
market for the first time since March to stem gains in its
currency.  “The market is still concerned about the possibility of a
sharper-than-expected slowdown” in the Australian economy, said
Callum Henderson, global head of currency research at Standard
Chartered Plc in  Singapore . “There’s been some spillover from
poor retail sales data yesterday.”  The Aussie fell 2 percent to $1.0537, its lowest level
since July 12, at 11:41 a.m. in  New York  from $1.0755 in New
York yesterday. The currency rose 0.5 percent to 83.27 yen,
after earlier surging 2.8 percent, its biggest gain since March
18.  New Zealand’s dollar dropped 1.9 percent to 84.68 U.S.
cents from 86.35 cents. It climbed 0.6 percent to 66.91 yen from
66.55 yen, after falling to as low as 66.10 yen yesterday, the
least since July 14.  Stocks Fall  The MSCI Asia Pacific index of regional shares slumped 2.1
percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 2.9 percent after
gaining 0.5 percent yesterday, snapping seven days of losses,
amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  will consider another
economic stimulus program to prevent a recession.  Yields on October interbank cash-rate futures fell to 4.51
percent on the Sydney Futures Exchange from 4.81 percent on Aug.
1. That indicates traders see a 96 percent chance of a rate cut
from the Reserve Bank of Australia by October, Bloomberg
calculations show. The central bank held its benchmark at 4.75
percent on Aug. 2.  The kiwi maintained losses against the dollar after Finance
Minister Bill English said the currency has reached levels no
one could anticipate and New Zealand would prefer a lower
exchange rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
