Mauritius’s rupee depreciated to a
more than one-week low against the dollar on concern a debt
crisis in  Europe , the island nation’s biggest trading partner,
will deepen, curbing demand for frontier-market assets.  The currency weakened as much as 1.1 percent to 28.2 per
dollar and was trading 0.7 percent down at 28.1 by 12:15 p.m. in
Port Louis. Versus the euro, the rupee depreciated by 1.2
percent to 40.0917.  Fitch Ratings  and Moody’s Investors Service affirmed their
AAA rating for the U.S., warning that downgrades were possible,
if lawmakers fail to enact debt-reduction measures and the
economy weakens. Spanish and Italian 10-year government bonds
fell for a sixth straight day as Finnish Prime Minister  Jyrki
Katainen  said the Mediterranean nations’ yields are “extremely
worrying and scary.”  “ Risk aversion  has clearly increased amid growing concerns
about the prospect of slow global economic growth and the
persisting eurozone debt crisis,” Fabien Gebert, treasurer at
GML, an investment group that says it’s the country’s biggest by
revenue, wrote in e-mailed comments. “Our local economy, which
is mostly driven by the export and the financial sectors, will
be certainly impacted.”  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 27.302 rupees to
27.467 rupees, with a selling price of 28.765 rupees per dollar,
according to indicative rates published today on the  Bank of
Mauritius’s website .  Mauritius’s 38-member SEMDEX stocks index retreated for a
second day, losing 0.5 percent to 2023.43, led by  State Bank of
Mauritius Ltd. (SBM) , the country’s second-largest lender by market
value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
