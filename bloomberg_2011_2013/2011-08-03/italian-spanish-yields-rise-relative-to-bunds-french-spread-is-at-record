Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds
fell for a sixth-straight day, while the additional yield
investors demand to hold similar-maturity French securities
instead of benchmark German bunds widened to a euro-era record.  The yield on 10-year Italian bonds rose 12 basis points to
6.25 percent as of 7:43 a.m. in  London , pushing the difference
in yield, or spread, with similar-maturity German debt 19 basis
points wider to 391 basis points.  Spanish 10-year yields increased 13 basis points to 6.41
percent, sending the yield spread with bunds 20 basis points
wider to 407 basis points.  French 10-year bonds underperformed the German securities,
with the yield spread reaching 78 basis points, the most since
the euro was introduced in 1999. The Belgian-German yield spread
also reached a euro-era record, at 209 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
