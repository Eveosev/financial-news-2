Rexam Plc (REX) , the world’s biggest maker
of drinks cans, surged the most in two years in London trading
after first-half profit rose 29 percent on demand from Europe.  Rexam advanced 14.20 pence, or 4 percent, to 368 pence at
the 4:30 p.m. close of London trading. That was the biggest jump
since Aug. 11, 2009. Net income advanced to 132 million pounds
($216 million), from 102 million pounds a year earlier, London-
based Rexam said today in a statement. Sales rose 1.3 percent to
2.34 billion pounds. It proposed an interim dividend of 4.7
pence.  “Beverage cans traded better than expected, driven
primarily by our business in Europe,” Chief Executive Officer
Graham Chipchase said in the statement. “Looking ahead, we will
concentrate on return on capital, costs and cash generation and
expect continued good performance for the rest of the year.”  Rexam agreed in June to sell its unprofitable closures unit
to Berry Plastics Corp. for $360 million in cash. The sale of
the business, which posted a loss of 112 million pounds last
year, may help Rexam expand in  Brazil , where it intends to build
a factory with production capacity of 1.2 billion cans a year.  The company is also investing about 30 million pounds over
two years to increase its can production at the Taloja plant
near  Mumbai  in  India , it said in today’s statement. The new
line, which will begin output in the fourth quarter next year,
will produce between 400 million and 950 million cans annually.  Rexam had 1.6 billion pounds of net debt by June 30. The
company invested 86 million pounds in the first half and expects
full-year spending of about 220 million pounds, it said.  Beverage can volumes increased 7 percent in the period,
compared with a 6 percent expansion in the market. The gain was
driven “largely by the strong growth in energy drinks in  Europe 
and also those filled in Europe for export,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
