OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil producer
controlled by Russiaâ€™s natural-gas export monopoly, said second-
quarter profit climbed 56 percent on higher crude prices.  Net income rose to $1.17 billion from $747 million in the
year-earlier period, the Moscow-based company said today in a
statement. That missed the $1.23 billion average estimate of
four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Urals crude prices for northwest  Europe  averaged $113.87
barrel in the quarter, about 48 percent higher than a year
earlier, according to Bloomberg data.  Gazprom Neft increased refining by 9.3 percent compared
with the previous three-month period, while crude export volumes
outside the  Commonwealth of Independent States  fell 5.8 percent.  Adjusted earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation
and amortization jumped 60 percent to $2.48 billion from a year
earlier. Revenue gained 43 percent to $11.5 billion.  Gazprom Neft fell 1.5 percent to 135.60 rubles as of 1:20
p.m. in Moscow. The stock is up 5.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
