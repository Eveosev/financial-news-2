Nampak Wiegand Glass, a joint venture
between  Nampak Ltd. (NPK)  and Wiegand-Glas, is considering firing
workers as South African wine exporters shift from glass bottles
to bulk exports,  Financial Mail  reported without saying where it
got the information.  Nampak Wiegand Glass, based in Johannesburg, has seen wine
bottle prices increase below 5 percent for the past two years.
The company hasnâ€™t fully recovered costs, which are driven by
electricity, transport, gas prices and labor, Financial Mail
cited Managing Director Stoney Steenkamp as saying. The
proportion of South African wine exported in bulk format
increased to 45.6 percent by June 2011 from 32 percent in 2005,
Financial Mail reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Wine producers are opting to export in bulk to save costs
and offset the impact of a strong rand, Financial Mail said,
citing  FirstCape  Managing Director Kobus van der Vyfer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
