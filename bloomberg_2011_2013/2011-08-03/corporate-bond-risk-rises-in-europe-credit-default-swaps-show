The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose to the highest
levels since Aug. 12, according to traders of credit-default
swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments increased 3 basis points to 280 at 10:30 a.m. in
London. An increase signals deteriorating perceptions of  credit
quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 17.5
basis points to 617, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 3 basis point to 146 basis points.
The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25
banks and insurers increased 5.5 basis points to 225.5 and the
subordinated index climbed 9 to 384.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
