Ukrainian grain exports were at an
“unprecedented low” in July following the introduction of
taxes on them for the first time, said Sergey Stoianov, director
of the Ukrainian Agrarian Confederation.  About 380,000 metric tons of grain was exported in July
including 160,000 tons of corn, 170,000 tons of barley and
40,000 tons of corn, the Kiev-based producers’ group said on its
website today. That compares with 1.5 million tons in June,
before the tax, according to Ukraine Grain, which represents
producers and traders.  The grain export decline in July “is most likely a
reflection of the destructive effect of the export duty, which
sterilizes the revenue which farmers can get from world
markets,” Stoianov said in a statement.  Export duties for corn, wheat and barley began July 1 and
will run until Jan. 1. Corn exports are taxed at 12 percent,
wheat at 9 percent, and barley at 14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
