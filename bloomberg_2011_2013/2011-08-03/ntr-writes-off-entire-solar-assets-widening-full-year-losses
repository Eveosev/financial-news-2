NTR Plc, a Dublin-based energy and
infrastructure company, wrote off its entire investments in
solar thermal energy, contributing to record full-year losses.  The company’s attributable loss in the fiscal year ended in
March widened to 280.2 million euros ($400 million), from 210.6
million euros a year earlier, it said today in a  statement . The
figure included a 42.4 million euro charge for its solar
businesses, including manufacturer Stirling Energy Systems and
U.S.-based development arm Tessera Solar, it said.  “NTR has decided to not invest in solar anymore,” Rachel Watchorn, a spokeswoman, said by phone, without elaborating.  NTR this year limited funding for SES after the unit failed
to secure sufficient third-party investment. SES makes devices
with mirrored parabolic dishes that concentrate sunlight on
“Stirling” engines to generate power. They were to be used in
two large-scale projects in the U.S. developed by Tessera until
both were sold off to companies using other technology.  “Parabolic dish solar thermal technology in general has
taken a beating from ever-cheaper PV and cannot offer solar
thermal’s other advantages of thermal inertia and the potential
for heat storage,” Jenny Chase, a solar analyst for Bloomberg
New Energy Finance, said by e-mail. “Nonetheless it is a
surprise NTR decided its solar business was worth nothing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
