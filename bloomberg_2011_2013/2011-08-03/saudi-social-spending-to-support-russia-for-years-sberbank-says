Saudi Arabian social spending aimed
at preventing the kind of political unrest that has gripped the
 Middle East  will help support oil prices and Russia’s economy,
OAO Sberbank said.  The country’s higher spending commitments require crude
prices of about $100 a barrel, a level that would support
Russian budget revenues “for a long time to come,” Ksenia Yudaeva, chief economist at Russia’s largest bank, told
reporters today in Moscow.  “The overall social tension in  Saudi Arabia  will
definitely help keep Russia afloat, even if there’s a slowdown
in global growth,” Yudaeva said. “In that sense, the Russian
economy may be partially isolated.”  Saudi Arabia has raised social expenditures after popular
revolutions toppled governments in Tunisia and Egypt. Russia,
the world’s largest energy exporter, needs oil prices to average
$125 a barrel over the next three years to balance its budget,
according to the  Finance Ministry . Urals crude, Russia’s main
export blend, fell today to $114.37, the lowest since July 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
