(Corrects second paragraph of story published Aug. 3 to
say 90,000 barrels a day was the peak output, not average.)  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Angolan operating
unit is ceasing production at its Xikomba oil field as the
deposit’s life cycle of about seven years is “ending now,”
said Fernando Pegado, a company spokesman.  Production at the field, some 145 kilometers (90 miles)
offshore in Angola’s Block 15, started in 2003 and has yielded
“close to” 100 million barrels in total, Pegado said today by
phone from Luanda. Peak output was 90,000 barrels a day and the
company is now carrying out “decommissioning activities,” he
said.  The last export cargo of Xikomba crude was shipped in
March, according to loading programs tracked by Bloomberg.  Exxon Mobil has 40 percent of the field, BP Plc 26.67
percent, Eni SpA 20 percent and Statoil ASA 13.33 percent.
Exxon’s local unit is Esso Exploration  Angola .  To contact the reporter on this story:
