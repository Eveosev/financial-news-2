We defined a hidden billionaire as an
individual who has a net worth of $1 billion or more and who
hasn’t appeared on a major international rich list. (A few of
our billionaires have been mentioned in smaller regional
rankings.)  When Bloomberg Markets listed billionaires with their
families, family members hold a portion of the person’s assets;
however, the fortune is ultimately controlled by the individual.  In calculating net worth, we priced the stakes in public
companies as of July 11 and included dividend income paid to
that date.  Private companies were valued in several ways, most often
by applying price-to-sales and price-earnings ratios of similar
public companies. We tried to identify and confirm all potential
liabilities; however, we made no assumptions about personal
debt.  We didn’t apply any liquidity discounts to private
companies. When we couldn’t verify stakes in private assets, we
didn’t include them in net worth calculations. We deducted
appropriate taxes based on prevailing income, dividend and
capital gains tax rates in a billionaire’s country of
citizenship.  Each billionaire or his or her representative was given an
opportunity to respond to questions regarding the net worth
estimate, including assets and liabilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
