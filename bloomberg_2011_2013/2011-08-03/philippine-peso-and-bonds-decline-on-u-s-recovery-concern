The Philippine peso weakened for a
second day and  government bonds  fell on concern the U.S.
economic recovery is faltering, hurting demand for emerging-
market assets.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of stocks declined 2.3 percent
after data showed U.S. consumer spending dropped in June for the
first time since September 2009. President  Barack Obama  signed
legislation yesterday that raises the nation’s debt ceiling
until 2013 and threatens automatic spending cuts to enforce $2.4
trillion in cost reductions over 10 years. The peso pared losses
after Philippine President  Benigno Aquino  said it’s within the
“tolerable level” of 41 to 43 per dollar.  “There is concern there may be a slowdown or a recession
in the U.S.,” said Marcelo Ayes, senior vice president at Rizal
Commercial Banking Corp. in  Manila . “Stock markets and
currencies in the region are being hit.”  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 42.233 per dollar as of the 4
p.m. close in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It
dropped as much as 0.6 percent to 42.395 earlier, the weakest
level since July 26.  Inflation threats from hot-money flows are “more
worrisome” than the strength of the peso, Aquino said. The
currency has rallied 3.3 percent against the dollar this year.  The yield on the 5.875 percent notes due January 2018 rose
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.19 percent,
according to Amstel Financial Services.  The government had a budget deficit of 7.7 billion pesos
($182 million) in June, compared with a shortfall of 9.6 billion
pesos in May, official data released today showed. The shortfall
was 17.2 billion pesos in the first half, better than the 152.1
billion peso target the government had set.  To contact the reporter for this story:
