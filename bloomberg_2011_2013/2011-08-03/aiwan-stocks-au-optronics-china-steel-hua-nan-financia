said Jerry Bau, an analyst at Jih Sun Securities Co.  Qisda Corp. (2352) 
(2352 TT), a unit of AU, gained 4.3 percent to NT$9.05, snapping
a four-day, 18 percent plunge.  “The prices are very weak and bad news has been priced
in,” Bau said in a phone interview. The gains also came after
Chimei’s client Sony Corp. said it plans to overhaul its money-
losing television business to cut costs.  Epistar Corp. (2448)  (2448 TT) slumped 6.9 percent to NT$61.80,
the lowest close since April 20, 2009. Its share-price estimate
was cut to NT$58.50 from NT$73 at Macquarie Group Ltd., which
has an “underweight” rating on the light-emitting diode maker.  Everlight Electronics Co. (2393 TT) tumbled 6.9 percent to
NT$56.90, the lowest close since March 9, 2009. Macquarie
forecast the second-half outlook will be “soft” and said it
saw the potential for intensified competition in lighting from
China and  Korea .  MStar Semiconductor Inc. (3697 TT) increased 5.2 percent to
NT$143 after the chip designer was rated “outperform” in new
coverage at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. The brokerage has a 12-
month share-price estimate of NT$210.  Powertech Technology Inc. (6239)  (6239 TT), a chip-packaging and
testing company, advanced 5.4 percent to NT$79.60, the steepest
rise since April 29. The shares gained on speculation the
company will get NAND flash chip packaging and testing orders

president at Capital Securities Corp., said in an e-mail today.
Evan Tseng, the company’s spokesman, wasn’t immediately
