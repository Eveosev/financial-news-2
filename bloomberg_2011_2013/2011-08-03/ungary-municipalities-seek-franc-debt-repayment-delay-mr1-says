Hungarian municipalities are seeking
to delay repayments on the principal of mostly Swiss franc-
denominated bonds by one year,  MR1  radio said, citing the
association of local governments.  Gains in the Alpine country’s currency against the forint
are raising payments for local governments on about 600 billion
forint ($3.1 billion) of debt, mostly Swiss franc bonds, the
public radio station reported on its website, citing Gyorgy
Gemesi, the group’s president. That is about half of local
governments’ outstanding loans, he said, according to MR1.  Banks agreed to the delay in “background talks,” Gemesi
said, according to MR1. The association will write a letter to
Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  on the issue today, MR1 said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
