Polish stocks fell the most in almost
two years, led by banks and commodity companies as signs of a
global economic slowdown drove investors from riskier assets.  The WIG20 equity gauge slumped as much as 4.3 percent, its
biggest intraday drop since October 2009, and traded down 3.6
percent to 2,569.31 as of 5 p.m. in Warsaw. PKO Bank Polski SA,
with a 14 percent weighting in the index, slipped the most in
more than a year, trading down 5.1 percent to 37.96 zloty.  Investors ditched shares worldwide and most emerging-market
currencies and bought U.S., German and Japanese bonds as signs
of slowing global economic growth stoked demand for the relative
safety of government debt. Equities kept losses even after a
U.S. report showed employers in the world’s largest economy
added more jobs than analysts forecast.  “The continued focus on global growth ahead of U.S.
employment data led to a major slide in all regional emerging-
market equities, following on from the drop in the U.S. equity
markets yesterday,” RBC Capital Markets analysts led by  Nick Chamie  in Toronto wrote in a report to clients earlier today.  Poland’s zloty lost as much as 0.6 percent to the euro and
last traded 0.3 percent weaker at 4.0342. Copper producer  KGHM
Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  fell 4.7 percent to 176.5 zloty as commodities
declined. Oil refiner PKN Orlen SA slid 3.3 percent to 43.77.  To contact the reporter on this story:
