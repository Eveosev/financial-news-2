German stocks slid the most in more
than two years, closing at the lowest level since October, amid
concern that the global economic recovery is stalling.  ThyssenKrupp AG sank 6.1 percent as metal prices retreated.
Draegerwerk AG & Co. KGaA declined 12 percent as it reported a
drop in second-quarter profit after taxes.  The benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  decreased 3.4 percent to 6,414.76
at the 5:30 p.m. close in Frankfurt, the seventh day of declines
for the longest falling streak since January 2009. The gauge has
retreated 15 percent from this year’s high on May 2 as investors
speculated that  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis would derail the
region’s economic recovery. The decline has left the DAX trading
at 10.2 times the reported earnings of its companies, the lowest
since 2008. The broader HDAX Index lost 3.6 percent today.  The  European Central Bank  left  interest rates  unchanged
today as economic growth slows and the region’s debt crisis
spreads to Italy and  Spain , increasing pressure on policy makers
to resume bond purchases. ECB officials meeting in  Frankfurt 
kept the benchmark rate at 1.5 percent as predicted by all 54
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “We’re currently neutral on Europe and U.S. stocks,” said
Christian Schick, head of  portfolio management  at BNP Paribas
Investment Partners, in a phone interview. “It’s a situation
that is currently more driven by politics than by the much
better earnings season in the U.S. or lower valuations in
Europe. We are underweight equities and we have been for a few
weeks.”  ThyssenKrupp, Volkswagen  ThyssenKrupp,  Germany ’s biggest steelmaker, slumped 6.1
percent to 25.60 euros as aluminum, lead, nickel, tin and zinc
all fell on the London Metal Exchange.  Salzgitter AG (SZG) , the second
largest, sank 4.9 percent to 41.19 euros.  Preferred shares of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s biggest
carmaker, lost 4 percent to 121.30 euros, while  Siemens AG (SIE) ,
Europe’s biggest engineering company, declined 4 percent to
78.04 euros.  Draegerwerk tumbled 12 percent to 73.69 euros, its biggest
decline since December 2008, as the medical-technology company
said second-quarter profit after taxes fell to 30.4 million
euros from 37.2 million euros in the year-earlier period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
