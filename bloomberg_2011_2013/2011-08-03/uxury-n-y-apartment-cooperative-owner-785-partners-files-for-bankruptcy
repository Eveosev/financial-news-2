New York  City real estate-company
785 Partners LLC, owner of a 42-story glass tower at 785 Eighth
Avenue, filed for  bankruptcy protection .  The company listed both assets and debt of $100 million to
$500 million in Chapter 11 documents filed today in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  The 566-foot building was co-developed by  Esplanade Capital 
with 122 condominium units that reflect sunsets and look down on
Midtown Manhattan, according to a 2007 Real Estate Weekly
article. The building represented a return to high-rises that
fell from favor in the 1980s, according to a New York Times
 article  on Esplanade’s website.  “The sliver building is making a comeback,” writer Josh
Barbanel said in the article.  Jay Eisenstadt, president of Esplanade, declined to comment
today on the bankruptcy.  The building was designed by  Ismael Leyva Architects , which
also designed One Central Park Condominiums at Time Warner
Center and whose other  Manhattan  projects include the Jasper, a
boutique loft building in Murray Hill, and 60 Spring Street, a
condominium building in Soho, according to the firm’s Web site.  The building joins other luxury New York buildings that
have filed for bankruptcy over the past 2 1/2 years, the 34-
story  Lipstick Building  on Third Avenue between 53rd and 54th
streets, and a 12-story condominium development owned by Water
Street Realty Group LLC.  Wrong Address  Lawyers for the debtor said they would re-file the papers
after listing the wrong Manhattan address in the voluntary
petition.  “It’s 785 Eighth Avenue,” attorney Andrew K. Glenn of
Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman LLP said in an e-mailed
message. “A correction will be filed shortly.”  The case is In re 785 Partners LLC, 11-13702,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
