Malaysia ’s ringgit fell to a one-week
low and government bonds advanced on concern a slowing economic
recovery in the U.S. will damp demand for exports.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of stocks slumped to the lowest
level since June after data overnight showed  consumer spending 
in the world’s largest economy dropped in June for the first
time in almost two years. The U.S. Institute for Supply
Management said on Aug. 1 its manufacturing index dropped to
50.9 last month, the lowest in two years.  “We should start to see some downward adjustment to growth
prospects given the current global economic weakness,” said
Yeah Kim Leng, Kuala Lumpur-based chief economist at RAM
Holdings Bhd. “Exporters in emerging markets are still
vulnerable and this should slow the currency appreciation
path.”  The ringgit slid 0.4 percent to 2.9735 per dollar as of
4:28 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It lost 0.7 percent yesterday. The FTSE KLCI Index of
stocks dropped 0.4 percent.  Consumer spending in the U.S. declined 0.2 percent in June
after rising 0.1 percent a month earlier, the Commerce
Department said yesterday. The median forecast of economists in
a Bloomberg survey was for an increase of 0.1 percent. The U.S.
bought 8 percent of Malaysia’s exports in the first five months
of this year.  Malaysia’s overseas sales grew 5.8 percent in June from a
year earlier, following a 5.4 percent gain in May, according to
the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
The trade ministry will release the data tomorrow.  The government’s benchmark 10-year bonds rose, pushing
yields to the lowest level since the government sold the
securities in January.  The yield on the 4.16 percent note due July 2021 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.76 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia. The price increased 0.2, or 2
ringgit per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 103.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
