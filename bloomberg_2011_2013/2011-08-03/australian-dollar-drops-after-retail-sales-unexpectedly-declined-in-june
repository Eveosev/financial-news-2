Australia ’s currency fell for a fifth
day against the  U.S. dollar  in the longest losing streak in
almost a year after data showed an unexpected decline in retail
sales in June.  The Aussie fell against most of its major peers after the
Bureau of Statistics in Sydney reported a lower-than-forecast
trade surplus. Yields on all Australian government bonds fell
below the central bank’s cash rate for the first time since
2009. New Zealand’s dollar slid to the lowest two weeks against
the greenback after Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the world’s
largest dairy exporter, said whole-milk powder prices remained
near an eight-month low.  “It just adds to a long line of weaker-than-expected data
from Australia,”  Gareth Berry , a currency strategist at UBS AG
in Singapore, said about the retail sales report. “Clearly it’s
not good news” for the Australian dollar, he said.  Australia’s currency weakened 0.6 percent to $1.0715 at
12:13 p.m. in  New York , from $1.0779 yesterday. It touched
$1.0679, the lowest since July 19. Its last five straight days
of losses ended Aug. 13, 2010. The Aussie fell 1 percent to
82.36 yen and reached 82.08 yen, its weakest level since March.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, lost 0.4 percent
to 86.29 U.S. cents, from 86.65 cents, and reached 85.76, the
lowest since July 21. It slid 0.8 percent to 66.32 yen, from
66.85 yesterday, and touched 66.10, the least since July 14.  Retail Sales  Australia’s retail sales decreased 0.1 percent from a month
earlier, when they fell 0.6 percent, the Bureau of Statistics
said. That compares with the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey for a 0.4 percent gain. The country had a  trade surplus 
of A$2.05 billion ($2.2 billion) in June, the statistics bureau
said. That compares with a forecast of A$2.2 billion, according
to a separate survey.  The yield on the Australian government bond due in April
2023, the longest outstanding maturity, declined to as low as
4.68 percent, compared with the  Reserve Bank  of Australia’s
benchmark interest rate of 4.75 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Milk powder for October delivery was $3,477 a metric ton,
from $3,474 two weeks earlier, which was the lowest since Nov.
16, according to Auckland-based Fonterra’s  GlobalDairyTrade 
auction. The near-term contract fell 0.6 percent from the July
19 sale, according to a trade-weighted  price index  from the
company. Whole-milk powder has slumped 30 percent since reaching
a record $4,958 a ton in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
