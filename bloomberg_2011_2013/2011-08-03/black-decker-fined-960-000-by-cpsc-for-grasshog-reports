Black & Decker Inc., the Maryland-
based power-tool manufacturer, will pay $960,000 to settle
allegations it didn’t alert U.S. regulators about a defective
weed trimmer, the  Consumer Product Safety Commission  said.  The subsidiary of  Stanley Black & Decker Inc. (SWK)  “knowingly
failed to report several safety defects and hazards” relating
to its Grasshog XP model, and it withheld information as the
agency tried to investigate reports of injury, the CPSC said in
a statement today. About 158 people were injured between 2005
and 2009, according to the CPSC.  The company knew that the high-powered, electric Grasshog
was defective by May 2006, and CPSC closed an early defect
investigation based on incomplete information, the agency said.
Black & Decker then didn’t provide complete information about
“mounting numbers of incidents and injuries” until October
that year, according to the statement.  By July 2007, when the trimmer was recalled, there were
more than 700 reported incidents and 58 injuries, the CPSC said.
The device’s spool, spool cap and pieces of trimmer string could
come loose, becoming projectiles, the agency said. The Grasshog
could also overheat and burn consumers.  Following reports of an additional 100 injuries, the recall
was re-announced in August 2009, according to the CPSC. The
trimmer was sold for about $70 from November 2005 through 2007,
the agency said. Consumers can contact Black & Decker for a free
repair kit.  Black & Decker denies CPSC allegations that it knowingly
violated the law, according to the agency statement.  Tim Perra, a spokesman for  New Britain , Connecticut-based
Stanley Black & Decker, didn’t immediately respond to a phone
call and e-mail seeking comment.  Stanley Black & Decker rose $1.14, or 1.8 percent, to
$64.72 at 3:18 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have declined 5.2 percent this year before
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
