The U.S. government will ban the
sale of ground beef that contains six strains of the E. coli
bacteria that increasingly have been found in the meat supply,
the New York Times reported today on its website.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will begin enforcing the
rule in March, to allow meatpackers time to prepare for the
change, the newspaper said, citing Dr. Elisabeth Hagen, the head
of  food safety  at the USDA. Meat found to contain the banned
strains will have to be diverted for use in cooked products,
according to the Times. Cooking the meat to 160 degrees
Fahrenheit kills the bacteria.  The six lesser-known forms of E. coli will now be treated
the same as E. coli 0157:H7, which has sickened thousands and
caused the recall of millions of pounds of ground beef and other
products. It was banned from ground beef in 1994 after causing
an outbreak that killed four children, the Times said.  The USDA had no immediate comment on the Times report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
