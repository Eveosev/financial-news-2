Morgan Stanley (MS)  puts were the most
active in the U.S. equity-options market after an investor
bought a block of contracts with a strike price 25 percent below
yesterday’s closing level.  A trader purchased 34,532 October $16 puts to sell the
owner of the world’s largest retail brokerage for 28 cents each,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The October $16 put
contract had an open interest of 193 before today, the data
show. This was the biggest trade in New York-based Morgan
Stanley’s puts since January 2010, according to  Henry Schwartz ,
president of Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based provider of
options-market data and analytics.  “It’s a pretty impressive trade,” said Schwartz in a
telephone interview. “It’s a downside hedge into the fall.
Somebody is maybe getting seriously nervous. It does show some
significant concern or desire to hedge risk of a move lower.”  Morgan Stanley has been trading below book value, or the
value of its assets, and the shares are near the lowest level
since March 2009. Revenue climbed to $9.28 billion from $7.96
billion a year earlier, the highest since the end of the
financial crisis, the company said July 21. The stock jumped 11
percent that day. It has dropped 14 percent since, as financial
companies in the  S&P 500  retreated 6.8 percent amid concerns the
U.S. recovery is weakening and the European sovereign-debt
crisis will spread. Morgan Stanley shares fell 2.7 percent to
$20.74 at 2:52 p.m. in  New York .  Right to Sell  The 34,532-option trade would give the right to sell
3,453,200 Morgan Stanley shares at $16. The company hasn’t
closed below $16 since January 2009.  Morgan Stanley’s September $20 puts were the sixth-most-
traded equity contracts in the U.S. after two blocks of more
than 5,000 traded. Those puts rose 62 percent to 89 cents each.  Implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices, for at-
the-money options expiring in 30 days, advanced to 42.35 from
37.11 yesterday.  More than 90,000 Morgan Stanley puts changed hands, 6.1
times the four-week average and 3.5 times the numbers of calls
to buy. Volume of the bearish options rose to its highest level
since April 2010. The October $16 puts were the most traded and
accounted for more than a third of all put volume. The
contracts, which expire Oct. 21, gained 65 percent to 33 cents
each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
