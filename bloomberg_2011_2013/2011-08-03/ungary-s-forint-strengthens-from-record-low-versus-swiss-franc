Hungary’s forint strengthened against
the franc, rebounding from its weakest level on record after the
Swiss central bank said today it may take measures to stop
further currency appreciation.  The forint appreciated 1.1 percent to 246.102 against the
franc at 9:49 a.m. in Budapest after earlier sliding to 252.974,
its weakest against the Swiss currency since Bloomberg started
tracking the data in 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
