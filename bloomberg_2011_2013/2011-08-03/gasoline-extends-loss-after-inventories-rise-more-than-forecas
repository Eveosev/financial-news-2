Gasoline extended losses after the
Energy Department reported U.S. stockpiles increased more than
forecast last week.  The government said supplies expanded 1.7 million barrels
to 215.2 million in the week ended July 29. Analysts projected a
rise of 250,000 barrels, according to the median of 15 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline for September delivery sank 9 cents, or 3 percent,
to $2.9473 a gallon at 10:32 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices were $2.9657 before the reportâ€™s release at
10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Stockpiles of heating oil and diesel rose 409,000 barrels
in the seven days ended July 29. Analysts forecast a 1.5
million-barrel increase, according to the survey.  September-delivery heating oil dropped 5.58 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $3.0358 a gallon, from $3.0437 before the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
