The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 12:21 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 1 percent to 13,818.57 while the Colcap
Index dropped 0.7 percent to 1,646.87.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  ,  Colombia ’s biggest oil company,
fell 0.5 percent to 3,700 pesos. Colombia’s government plans to
begin selling a stake in state-run oil company Ecopetrol SA next
year, Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said yesterday.  Echeverry made the comments after submitting to Congress a
proposal to sell as much as a 10 percent stake in the Bogota-
based company. The government, which owns about 90 percent of
Ecopetrol, had withdrawn an earlier proposal made this year for
the sale. It previously planned to begin the sale at year-end.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in Colombia, fell 2 percent to
49,400 pesos. Energy and Mines Minister Carlos Rodado said July
oil production would have reached 945,000 barrels per day if it
weren’t for a two-day blockade by protesters that began July 18
at the Rubiales field operated by the company, Dinero reported
on its daily website. Rodado said July production instead
reached 929,226.  To contact the reporter on this story:
