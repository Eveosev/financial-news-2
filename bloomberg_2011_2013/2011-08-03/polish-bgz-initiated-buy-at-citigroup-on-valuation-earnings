Bank Gospodarki Zywnosciowej SA, the
Polish unit of Rabobank Groep, was given a “buy”
recommendation at Citigroup Inc., which cited its “discount to
peers” and outlook for higher profitability.  BGZ’s plans to set up 75 new branches by next year and
start an online service that will make it more profitable in the
next three years, Andrzej Powierza and Simon Nellis, analysts at
Citigroup, wrote in an e-mailed report dated yesterday. The bank
part-owned by the Polish government had its share-price estimate
set at 66.8 zloty, a premium of 21 percent to yesterday’s share
price of 55.05 zloty.  Poland’s Treasury Ministry sold a 12 percent stake in BGZ
in an initial public offering in May, as part of a plan to raise
15 billion zloty ($5.3 billion) from state asset sales in 2011
to help finance the  budget deficit  and limit debt. The
government scaled back its offering from as much as 37 percent
because of “limited” investor demand.  BGZ is among the five worst-performing stocks of the 120
companies that debuted on the Warsaw exchange this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock dropped 4.5
percent to 52.55 zloty as of 5:20 p.m. in Warsaw, the most since
the shares started trading May 27.  BGZ’s return on equity, a measure of profitability, was 4.6
percent in 2010, compared with the industry average of 12
percent, according to Citigroup. Expansion into smaller towns
that have less competition and higher growth potential will
drive BGZ’s return on equity ratio to 11 percent by 2014, the
analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
