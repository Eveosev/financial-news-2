Ethanol futures declined to the
lowest price in three weeks in  Chicago  on speculation that a
slowing economy will curtail fuel demand.  Futures dropped with other commodities including crude oil,
gasoline and corn after the Institute for Supply Management said
 service industries  expanded in July at the slowest pace since
February 2010.  “This is macroeconomics affecting everything else,” said
Peyton Feltus, president of Randolph Risk Management in  Dallas .
“It’s lack of consumptive pull-through. That’s a good way of
saying lack of demand and fear of more of the same.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery dropped 4.2 cents, or
1.5 percent, to settle at $2.80 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures have gained 18 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf tumbled 5
cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.875 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive declined 3.5 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.75, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  fell 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.855 a
gallon and on the West Coast ethanol lost 4 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.975.  Corn for December delivery decreased 2.75 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $7.13 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Crude oil for September delivery dropped $1.86, or 2
percent, to settle at $91.93 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement since June 27. Prices have
climbed 11 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for September delivery slumped 10.6 cents, or 3.5
percent, to $2.9313 a gallon in New York. The contract includes
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  On a spot basis, an average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is making
8 cents on every gallon of the fuel, while a typical plant in
 Illinois  is pocketing 18 cents, according to Ag TraderTalk, a
Clive, Iowa-based online grains information service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
