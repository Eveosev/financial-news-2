Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK)  and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  had their supported debt ratings assigned a
negative outlook by Moody’s Investors Service, which cited a
similar action it took on the U.S. government debt rating.  Moody’s confirmed the banks’ supported ratings after they
were put on review for downgrade in July, the New York-based
ratings company said today in a statement. Moody’s yesterday
confirmed the U.S. government’s Aaa rating after President
Barack Obama signed a measure to raise the debt ceiling.  “There is a very high probability that these institutions
would be supported by the U.S. government to avoid a default,”
Moody’s said in the statement. “The supported ratings have a
negative outlook not only due to the U.S. government’s negative
outlook, but also due to Moody’s view that over time”
government support for top banks may decline.  Bank of  New York  has an Aa2 rating for senior debt, while
JPMorgan has an Aa3 rating, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
