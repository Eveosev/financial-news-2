Taiwan’s bonds rose, pushing five-
year yields to a one-month low, on speculation investors were
seeking the relative safety of government debt after an
unexpected decline in U.S. consumer spending.  The Taiex index of shares lost 1.5 percent and the  Taiwan
dollar  weakened for a second day after official data yesterday
showed spending dropped 0.2 percent in June, the first decrease
since September 2009, and U.S. personal income grew at the
slowest pace since November. Foreign funds sold $619 million
more local shares than they bought yesterday, taking net sales
for the year to $1.7 billion, according to exchange data.  “Yields are trending lower today as investors buy bonds
for safety purposes,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based fixed-
income trader at Polaris Securities Co. “We continue to see
short-sellers buy back bonds after seeing strong volumes
yesterday.”  The yield on the 2 percent securities due July 2016, the
most-traded government debt, dropped four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.130 percent as of the 1:30 p.m. local
close, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. That’s the
lowest level for a benchmark five-year bond since June 28.  Taiwan ’s dollar fell 0.2 percent to NT$28.938 against its
U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It reached NT$28.942 earlier, the weakest
level since July 19.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was unchanged at 0.380 percent, according
to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
