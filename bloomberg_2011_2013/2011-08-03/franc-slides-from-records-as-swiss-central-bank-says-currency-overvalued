The Swiss franc slid against the
dollar and the euro after the nation’s central bank said the
currency is “massively overvalued.”  The franc weakened as much as 1.3 percent to 1.09632
against the euro, before trading at 1.09490 as of 8:02 a.m. in
 London . The Swiss currency tumbled as much as 1.2 percent to
77.11 centimes against the dollar.  The central bank ``won't tolerate'' a ``tightening of monetary
conditions and is therefore taking measures'' against the franc, 
it said in an e-mailed statement today. The SNB is aiming for a 
three-month Libor as close to zero as possible, the bank said.  The franc earlier strengthened to records versus the 17-nation
euro and the dollar.  The SNB said it will ``significantly'' increase the supply of 
liquidity to the Swiss franc money market over the coming days 
to help counter the currency's appreciation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
