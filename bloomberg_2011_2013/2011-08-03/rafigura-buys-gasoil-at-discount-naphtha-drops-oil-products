Asia ’s gasoil remained discounted to
the spot benchmark after Trafigura Beheer BV bought the fuel in
Singapore, the region’s largest oil-trading center. Naphtha
margins fell.  Middle Distillates  Trafigura bought 0.5 percent sulfur gasoil, or diesel, for
a second day in Singapore, according to a Bloomberg News survey
of traders monitoring transactions on the Platts window. The
Dutch trader paid 50 cents a barrel below benchmark quotes to
Royal Dutch Shell Plc for Aug. 18 to Aug. 22, the same discount
as a transaction yesterday for the earliest loading period.  BP Plc purchased two gasoil cargoes, the survey showed.
 Europe ’s second-biggest oil company paid $128.10 a barrel to
Glencore International AG for 250,000 barrels and received a 30-
cent discount from  Singapore  Petroleum Co. for 150,000 barrels.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude rose 20
cents to $19.10 a barrel at 6:11 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, surged the most since March on Aug.
1 after Taiwan’s Formosa Petrochemical Corp. suspended export
obligations.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil dropped 25 cents to $1.55 a
barrel, the lowest level since July 22, PVM said. A narrowing
regrade signals it’s less profitable to produce  aviation fuel 
over diesel.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures, or
the crack spread, fell to $111.06 a metric ton at 6 p.m.
Singapore time from $113.57 at the end of Asian trading
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shell, the biggest buyer of 97-RON gasoline in the Platts
window last month, purchased 50,000 tons from Total SA at
$127.40 a barrel, the Bloomberg survey showed. Total also sold
50,000 barrels of 95-RON gasoline to Vitol Group at a $2.60
premium to quotes for 92-RON grade published by Platts.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 26 cents to
$6.60 a barrel at 6:11 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
The gap was the smallest since July 1, indicating reduced losses
for refiners turning oil into residual products.  PetroChina Co. sold 23,000 tons of 180-centistoke fuel oil
to Glencore at $3 a ton over benchmark quotes, according to the
Bloomberg survey. The Chinese company was a seller of 380-
centistoke grade yesterday.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
dropped $1 to $9.50 a ton, PVM said. This viscosity spread
narrowed the most since July 19, meaning bunker, or marine fuel,
has decreased less than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
