Garmin Ltd (GRMN) , the biggest maker of
mobile navigation systems in the U.S., missed second-quarter
earnings estimates and cut its full-year forecast because of a
shrinking market for portable devices in North America.  Earnings per share declined to 56 cents from 67 cents a
year earlier, the manufacturer said today in a statement. Profit
was less than the average of 67 cents a share of 12 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Garmin said earnings in 2011
will be within a range of $2 to $2.15 a share, down from a
forecast of $2.25 to $2.50 and less than the average estimate of
$2.44.  Garmin, which competes with Amsterdam-based  TomTom NV (TOM2) , aims
to get more revenue from maps, services and built-in systems in
cars and global positioning systems for bicyclists and golfers
amid a slowdown in sales of portable navigation devices for
vehicles.  The automotive division posted a 19 percent drop in revenue
because of “significant” volume declines of portable
navigation devices in  North America , which overwhelmed growth in
installations of in-vehicle systems, Garmin said.  Garmin fell as much as 5.6 percent to $29.76 and was down
2.5 percent as of 9:55 a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading in
 New York . That propelled the stock to a 3.1 percent drop this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
