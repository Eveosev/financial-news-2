The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
dropped to its lowest close in almost six weeks, shedding
351.35, or 1.1 percent, to 30,520.43 by the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s largest gold
producer, gained the most in three weeks, advancing 10.71 rand,
or 3.7 percent, to 300.71 rand. Gold rallied to a record for a
second straight day as escalating concern that the global
recovery may be losing momentum drove investors to buy the metal
to protect their wealth. A strike at South African gold
producers including AngloGold,  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)   and
Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR SJ) ended yesterday.  Harmony, Africa’s third-largest gold producer, increased to
its highest in more than two weeks, rising 2.91 rand, or 3
percent, to 99.41 rand.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s biggest mining
group, fell for an eighth day, the longest streak of losses
since October 2004, declining 6.92 rand, or 2.9 percent, to
236.08 rand. Copper fell to a three-week low in  London  on
concern the economic rebound is faltering in the U.S., the
world’s second-biggest user of the metal.  BHP Billiton  was cut
to “neutral” from “outperform” by analysts at Credit Suisse
Group AG.  Bidvest Group Ltd. (BVT)  , a diversified management and
services company, declined 4.02 rand, or 2.6 percent, to 153
rand, the lowest closing price since July 1. As many as 100,000
contract cleaners in  South Africa  are threatening to go on
strike if their pay demands aren’t met, the South African
Transport and Allied Workers’ Union said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Capital Property Fund (CPL)  , a property-management fund,
rose to a record, gaining 18 cents, or 2.1 percent, to 8.65
rand. The fund raised its distribution per unit for the six
months to June 30 by 11 percent to 31.36 cents.  Firestone Energy Ltd. (FSE)  , an Australian exploration
company with operations in South Africa, rose to its highest in
a week, gaining 2 cents, or 15 percent, to 15 cents. The group’s
joint venture Waterberg Coal Project received approval to mine
coal over the seven properties contained in the project.  Sappi Ltd. (SAP)  , the world’s biggest maker of glossy
paper, fell to its lowest in more than a year, dropping 56
cents, or 1.9 percent, to 28.85 rand. The company will take a
charge of about $5 million in the fourth quarter as a result of
its decision to shut down its Adamas paper mill at  Port
Elizabeth  in South Africa.  To contact the reporters on this story:
