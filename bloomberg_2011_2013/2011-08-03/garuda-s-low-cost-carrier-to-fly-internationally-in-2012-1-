State-owned PT Garuda  Indonesia , the
nation’s largest airline, said its low-cost carrier will start
flying international routes from next year.  Citilink plans to fly to  Singapore  and destinations in
 Malaysia , the  Philippines  and  Australia , Garuda Chief Financial
Officer Elisa Lumbantoruan said at a press briefing in Jakarta
today. The unit will be spun off into a fully owned company
called PT Citilink Indonesia in 2012 to help differentiate it
from Garuda’s full-service operations, President Director
Emirsyah Satar said in an interview today.  “We will strengthen domestic routes, and are looking to
expand to regional destinations,” he said.  Citilink, which currently operates five Boeing Co. 737s,
has 55 Airbus SAS A320 planes and two more 737s on order, Con
Korfiatis, an adviser to the Citilink board of directors, said
today. It is due to receive the first of the Airbuses next month,
he said. The low-cost carrier boosted passenger numbers by 60
percent to 731,000 in the first half from a year earlier and
said it expects to fly 2 million passengers this year.  The government is processing a license for Citilink, which
is expected to account for 30 percent of Garuda’s net revenue in
2015, Lumbantoruan said. Citilink had revenue of $48.1 million
in 2010, or 2.2 percent of Garuda’s $2.15 billion revenue,
according to the airline’s annual report.  -- Editors: Andrew Janes, Greg Ahlstrand  To contact the reporter on this story:
