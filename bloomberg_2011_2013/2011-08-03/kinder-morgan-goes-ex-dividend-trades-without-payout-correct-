(Correct size and date of declaration of dividend in story
originally published July 28.)  Kinder Morgan Inc. begins trading
today without the right to receive a $0.30 dividend declared
July 20. Investors had to own the stock before today to receive
the payout, which traders deduct from the companyâ€™s share price
on the ex-dividend date.
