Coffee exports from  Guatemala  rose 10
percent last month, according to the country’s National Coffee
Association, known as Anacafe.  Shipments climbed to 315,720 bags from 285,842 bags a year
earlier,  Anacafe  said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Exports for the marketing season that began Oct. 1 through
July totaled 3.1 million bags, compared with 3 million bags the
same period a year earlier, data from the association showed.  Guatemala will produce 3.95 million bags in the 2010-11
season, the  International Coffee Organization  estimated in its
June report, making it the largest producer in Central America.  A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
