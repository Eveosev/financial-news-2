European stocks sank the most in
fourth months, extending an 11-month low, amid concern the U.S.
recovery is faltering and the world’s largest economy may lose
its top  credit rating .  Societe Generale SA,  France ’s second-largest bank, tumbled
9 percent after the company reported second-quarter results that
missed analysts’ estimates.  Cairn Energy Plc (CNE)  fell 5.1 after
abandoning an oil well off Greenland.  UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UPM1V)  slumped
9.3 percent, its biggest decline in eight years.  The benchmark Stoxx  Europe  600 Index retreated 2 percent to
251.95 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , the biggest drop since
March 15. The gauge has declined 13 percent from this year’s
high on Feb. 17 as the yield on Italian and Spanish bonds surged
to records amid speculation the debt crisis won’t be contained.  “The  market sentiment  at the moment is on apocalypse
level,” said Peter Buergler, a trader at Luzerner Kantonalbank
AG in Lucerne,  Switzerland . “With the budget cuts in the U.S.,
opinions are resurfacing that the U.S. could possibly slide into
a recession. The loss of its AAA rating would send the markets
even more into a descent.”  Moody’s Investors Service said the outlook for the U.S.
debt grade is negative after President Barack Obama yesterday
signed into law a plan to lift the nation’s borrowing limit and
cut spending following months of wrangling between Democratic
and Republican lawmakers. Moody’s and Fitch Ratings affirmed
their AAA credit ratings for the U.S. while warning that
downgrades were possible if politicians fail to enact debt-
reduction measures and the economy weakens.  New Recession  The U.S. economy is “balanced on the edge,” said Harvard
University professor  Martin Feldstein , who joined four members
of a nine-person panel that dates recessions in seeing rising
odds of another downturn.  The economy now faces a 50 percent chance of sliding into a
new recession, Feldstein, a member of the Business Cycle Dating
Committee of the  National Bureau of Economic Research , said
yesterday in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene . “Nothing has given us
much growth,” he said.  Companies in the U.S. added 114,000 workers to payrolls in
July, slowing from 157,000 in June, according to figures from
ADP Employer Services. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for an advance of 100,000.  U.S. Economy  Separately, the Institute for Supply Management’s index of
non-manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of
the  U.S. economy , dropped to 52.7 in July from 53.3 in June.
Readings above 50 signal expansion, and economists had projected
a reading of 53.5, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey.  National benchmark indexes fell in all 18 western European
markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 lost 2.3 percent, France’s
CAC 40 slid 2.1 percent and  Germany ’s DAX plunged 2.3 percent.  The Stoxx 600 became “oversold” for the first time in
almost five months today as the 14-day Relative Strength Index,
which tracks momentum by comparing closing prices with daily
trading ranges, fell to 26.25. When the RSI slips below 30,
technical analysts say the underlying security has fallen too
sharply and is likely to gain. The measure last closed below 30
on March 16 after which it rallied 8.3 percent through May 2.  SocGen Earnings  Societe Generale (GLE)  declined 9 percent to 29.59 euros, its
biggest drop in two years, after second-quarter profit fell 31
percent because of a writedown on Greek government debt. Net
income dropped to 747 million euros ($1.06 billion) from 1.08
billion euros a year earlier, missing analysts’ estimates of
1.01 billion euros. The bank also said it may miss its 2012
earnings target.  Jean-Pierre Lambert, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods
Inc., downgraded the stock to “underperform” from “market
perform.”  Cairn Energy dropped 5.1 percent to 334.8 pence after
saying a well off Greenland will be plugged and abandoned as
drilling failed to find oil or gas.  UPM-Kymmene Oyj slumped 9.3 percent to 9 euros, the biggest
decline since January 2003, as Europe’s second-largest
papermaker forecast second-half profit will be similar to that
in the first half.  Lagardere SCA (MMB)  lost 8.1 percent to 23.54 euros, its lowest
price in two years, as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. downgraded the
French publisher to “conviction sell” from “neutral.”  Results Could Disappoint  “This is based on negative recent book sales data and
softer French magazine and radio ad indications,” Goldman Sachs
analysts wrote in a note to clients today. “We believe the
results could continue to disappoint the market.”  Meda AB (MEDAA) , Sweden’s second-largest health-care company, slid
7.6 percent to 69.95 kronor, its biggest drop since November,
after second-quarter net income fell to 381 million kronor ($59
million) from 683 million kronor a year earlier. Analysts had
estimated profit of 387 million kronor, according to a survey
compiled by Bloomberg.  Axel Springer , Europe’s largest newspaper publisher, surged
9.7 percent to 31.77 euros after saying that first-half
operating profit rose 11 percent. Earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization increased to 288.7 million
euros from 261.2 million euros a year earlier.  Rexam Plc (REX) , the world’s biggest maker of drinks cans, jumped
4 percent to 368 pence after first-half profit climbed 29
percent on demand from Europe. Net income advanced to 132
million pounds ($216 million) from 102 million pounds a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
