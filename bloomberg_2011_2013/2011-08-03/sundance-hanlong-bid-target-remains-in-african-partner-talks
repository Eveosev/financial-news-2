Sundance Resources Ltd., subject of
A$1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) takeover bid from its biggest
shareholder Sichuan Hanlong Group, remains in talks with
potential partners for its iron-ore project in  Africa .  “I am in discussions with various parties every other
day,” George Jones, chairman of the Perth-based company, told
reporters today at a conference in  Western Australia . “At the
same time, we’re engaged in talks with Hanlong to try and make
it more palatable to shareholders.”  Sundance said last month the bid from Hanlong undervalued
the company, which is seeking to develop the $4.7 billion Mbalam
mine, port and railroad project that straddles the border of
Cameroon and Republic of Congo. Jones said he doesn’t expect
Hanlong, which owns 18.6 percent of Sundance, to bypass the
board and put its offer directly to shareholders.  “We’re fundamentally not opposed to the concept as long as
they get all the numbers right and drop all the conditions,”
Jones said, referring to the bid.  Sundance shares dropped 1.9 percent to 51 cents at the 4:10
p.m. close in Sydney trading, compared with the 50 cents-a-share
cash bid from Hanlong. Sundance closed at 40 cents on July 15,
the last trading day before the offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
