France  had a colder and wetter July
than usual, helping restore soil-moisture reserves depleted by a
spring drought, the  Agriculture Ministry  said in a monthly
 weather review .  Average temperatures across the country were 19.2 degrees
Celsius (66.6 degrees Fahrenheit) last month, 1.3 degrees below
normal, the ministry said on its website. Average rainfall was
69 percent above the norm, it said.  France, the European Union’s largest agricultural producer,
built up a rainfall deficit in the first half of the year.
Precipitation since March 1 is still below normal in six out of
seven regions in France, according to the ministry.  “With the arrival of the rain in July, the level of useful
soil-water reserves climbs in all of mainland France,” the
ministry said. “Nevertheless, it still remains deficient for
half of the territory.”  France on average got 78 millimeters (3 inches) of rain in
July, according to the report. Corsica received 25 millimeters,
more than triple the seasonal norm, and the east-central part of
the country had double the normal amount at 123 millimeters, the
ministry said. Northern France on average received 73
millimeters of rain, 30 percent above normal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
