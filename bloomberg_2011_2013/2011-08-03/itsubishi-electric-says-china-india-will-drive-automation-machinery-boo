Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503) ,  Japan ’s
second-largest maker of machinery used to automate factories,
expects rising wages in  China  and India to fuel demand for its
products, President Kenichiro Yamanishi said.  Demand for Mitsubishi Electric’s factory automation
equipment is “constantly growing” in China, a trend that may
spread to India, Yamanishi said in an interview in Tokyo
yesterday. “It’s a transition period for China to be more
automated from labor-intensive work.”  Hourly manufacturing wages in China in 2010 surged 89
percent from five years ago, while they tripled in India,
according to estimates at research firm  Euromonitor
International . That’s prompting companies such as Foxconn
Technology Group, the world’s largest contract manufacturer of
electronics, to push plans to automate their factories.  Mitsubishi Electric expects revenue will rise 23 percent
over five years to 4.5 trillion yen ($58 billion) within the 12
months ending March 2016, the Tokyo-based company said in June.
Industrial automation systems made up 25 percent of sales and 39
percent of operating profit at the Tokyo-based company last
fiscal year.  The stock fell 1.3 percent to 904 yen at the 3 p.m. close
in  Tokyo  trading yesterday, paring its gain this year to 6.1
percent. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average has fallen 5.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
