Du, the  United Arab Emirates ’ second-
biggest phone company, posted a 51 percent jump in second-
quarter profit, missing analysts’ estimates.  Net income advanced to 207.2 million dirhams ($56.4
million) from 137.4 million dirhams a year earlier, the company
also known as  Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Co. (DU)  said in
a statement to the  Dubai bourse  today. The median estimate of
five analysts was for a profit of 215 million dirhams, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The profit was after the company
set aside 207.2 millions dirhams, or 50 percent of net income,
as royalty payment to the government.  Du competes with Emirates Telecommunications Corp., also
known as Etisalat, and has been gaining market share in the
second-biggest Arab economy since it started operations in 2007.
The company said it had 44 percent of the market share at the
end of June and second-quarter revenue climbed to 2.17 billion
dirhams from 1.7 billion dirhams a year earlier.  “Mobile is sustaining growth of this company,” Chief
Executive Officer Osman Sultan said in a conference call today.
“We are very optimistic for fixed-line business.” He said the
company expects to sign an agreement on infrastructure sharing
with Etisalat by the end of this year.  Du’s mobile phone subscribers increased by 171,100 in the
quarter to 4.8 million, while fixed-line customers grew 25
percent to 623,600 lines. The Dubai-based company plans to spend
as much as 1.7 billion dirhams in 2011 on infrastructure
development, Sultan said.  Du shares have gained 11 percent this year compared with a
3.7 percent fall by Etisalat. The stock dropped 0.3 percent to
close at 3.18 dirhams in Dubai today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
