Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators dropped for the first time in three
days as shipments to the Northeast declined.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments fell 6.3 percent to 22.9 million
dekatherms (22.3 billion cubic feet) from 24.4 million
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Schedules
for 702 of 743 pipelines had been reported as of 3:02 p.m.  Scheduled shipments to power generators in the Northeast
dropped 1.8 percent to 2.27 million dekatherms, with all 57
pipelines in the region having reported deliveries.  Temperatures in the Northeast will be in a normal range
through Aug. 7, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda, Maryland.  Boston will have a high of 76 degrees Fahrenheit (24
Celsius) tomorrow, 6 degrees below normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Power plants use about 30 percent of the nationâ€™s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Prices at the Transco-Z6 hub, which delivers gas to the New
York City region, dropped 7.9 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $4.6195
per million British thermal units on the Intercontinental
Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
