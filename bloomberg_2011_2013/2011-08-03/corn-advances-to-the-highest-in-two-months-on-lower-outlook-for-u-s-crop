Corn fell in  Chicago  on speculation
demand for raw materials may wane as consumers curb spending
amid concern the  U.S. economy ’s rebound is slowing. Wheat and
soybeans declined.  U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of
the economy, unexpectedly dropped in June for the first time in
almost two years, figures showed yesterday. Pacific Investment
Management Co. and BlackRock Inc., which together oversee almost
$5 trillion, say the U.S. economy is stalling.  “Everyone is trying to figure out how much corn would be
worth if the economy continues to slow down,” said Erin FitzPatrick, an analyst at Rabobank International in London.  Corn for December delivery dropped 3.75 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $7.12 a bushel by 10:50 a.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The grain climbed 4.4 percent yesterday
on speculation output would decline because of hot weather in
the U.S., the world’s biggest grower and exporter.  Reports due today may show U.S. factory orders slid 0.8
percent in June and private employers added fewer jobs in July,
according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Other figures
might show  service industries  in the U.S., the biggest part of
the economy, expanded in July at about the same pace as the
prior month.  Wheat for December delivery declined 10.75 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $7.48 a bushel. The grain added 5.3 percent
yesterday. Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE
Liffe in Paris rose 3.25 euros, or 1.7 percent, to 198.75 euros
($284.65) a metric ton.  Prices may be climbing in the French capital to match
yesterday’s gain in Chicago, FitzPatrick said. Milling wheat
dropped 1 percent yesterday.  Soybeans for November delivery fell 4.5 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $13.7525 a bushel in Chicago. The oilseed added 1.3
percent yesterday, the most since July 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
