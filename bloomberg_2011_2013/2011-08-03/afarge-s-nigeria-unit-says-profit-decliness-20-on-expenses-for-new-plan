Lafarge SA (LG) ’s Nigerian unit said
first-half profit dropped because the West African nation’s
second-biggest cement maker’s expenses increased as it prepares
to open a new plant.  Lafarge Cement WAPCO Nigeria Plc (WAPCO) ’s net income fell to 3.2
billion naira from 4.01 billion naira a year earlier, the
Ewekoro, western Nigeria-based company, said in a statement on
the Nigerian Stock Exchange’s  website . Revenue for the period
climbed to 29.5 billion naira from 23 billion naira, it said.  Nigeria, the continent’s most populous nation, is sub-
Saharan  Africa ’s biggest consumer of cement at 16.5 metric tons
in 2010, according to  Renaissance Capital . Producers are
increasing capacity by 12 million tons this year as consumption
per capita is expected to rise at a compounded rate of 8 percent
each year through 2015.  Lafarge Wapco has a “robust outlook for the rest of the
year on the back of its 2.2 million-ton new plant that is
expected to start production at the end of this month,”
Oluwakemi Oluwakiyesi, a Lagos-based analyst with Vetiva Capital
Management Ltd., said by phone today.  Vetiva, which rates the company “accumulate,” expected
first-half profit of 3.02 billion naira, Oluwakiyesi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
