OAO Lukoil,  Russia â€™s second-biggest
oil producer, headed for its lowest level in more than two weeks
as oil declined on signs of a slowing U.S. economy.  The shares slipped 1.3 percent to 1,812.2 rubles by 12:16
p.m. in Moscow. A close at that level would be their weakest
since July 18.  Crude dropped as much as 95 cents to $92.84 a barrel in  New
York . The contract yesterday slid $1.10 to $93.79.  To contact the reporter on this story:
