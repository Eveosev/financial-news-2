German federal subsidies will drop
20.7 percent next year from 2009 levels to 22.6 billion euros
($32.3 billion), the  Finance Ministry  said.  Most of the cuts will be made in financial aid to
companies, which has been scaled back as the economy recovers
from a 2009 slump, the ministry said in a report that was
approved by  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s Cabinet today. As in
previous years, most subsidies -- 52 percent in 2012 -- will go
to industry, the ministry said.  Total German subsidies, which include payments by the 16
states, municipalities and the European Union, will drop by 11.5
percent to about 49.3 billion euros this year from 2009, the
ministry said. Tax subsidies are also forecast to decline this
year and next after an increase in 2010.  “The development in subsidization is making a clear
contribution to the consolidation of the federal budget,” the
ministry said. “The increase in subsidization because of the
crisis was only temporary.”  Subsidies have been gradually cut since the start of the
millennium except for 2009 and 2010, when the financial crisis
prompted Merkel’s government to increase support in areas such
as car manufacturing. As a share of gross domestic product,
subsidies are at a “historic low,” the ministry said.  Germany ’s budget deficit will probably narrow to 1.8
percent of GDP this year from 3.3 percent in 2010,  Volker Kauder , the parliamentary leader of Merkel’s conservative bloc,
said July 8 on ARD public television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
