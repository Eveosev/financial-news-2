Greece  plans to raise the  sales tax 
on bottled water, soft drinks and juices to 23 percent from 13
percent,  Kathimerini  reported.  The value-added tax increase takes effect in September, the
Athens-based newspaper said, citing a Finance Ministry circular.  Fruit and vegetable juices, bottled waters, soft drinks,
coffees and teas are included in the new tax bracket, the
newspaper added.  Sales in the bottled water market dropped as much as 20
percent this year after the value-added tax was raised to 13
percent from 9 percent, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
