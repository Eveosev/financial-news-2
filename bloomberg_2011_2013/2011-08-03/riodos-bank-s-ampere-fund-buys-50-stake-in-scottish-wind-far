Ampere Equity Fund, the Dutch
renewable energy investor managed by a Triodos Bank NV unit,
acquired a 50 percent stake in a Scottish wind farm project run
by Green Power, a Scottish renewable energy developer.  “We are fully dedicated to renewable energy and we are
pleased with this new partnership with Green Power,” Joris van der Geest, chief investment officer of Ampere Equity Fund, said
today by telephone. “We have in total 13 investments in
renewable energy across  Europe  and we’ll continue investing in
this sector.” He declined to disclose the purchase price.  The Carraig Gheal wind farm in Argyll,  Scotland , is under
construction and due to be commissioned in late 2012, according
to a  statement  from the fund released today. It will include 20
Siemens SWT-2.3 variable speed wind generators with a total
capacity of 46 megawatts.  The farm is the second investment in U.K.-based wind power
for Amsterdam-based Ampere. The fund has capital of 320 million
euros including commitments from PGGM NV and Rabobank Group,
according to the company website.  Green Power will fund the rest of the project with loans
from two leading U.K. banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
