Russian service-sector growth
accelerated in July, helping offset a contraction in
manufacturing, HSBC Holdings Plc said.  The Services Business Activity Index reached 56.9 last
month from 55.1 in June, HSBC said in an e-mailed report, citing
data compiled by London-based Markit Economics. A reading above
50 indicates expansion; a reading below 50 shows contraction.  “Once more, faster output growth in the service sector has
more than offset the weakening of manufacturing growth, pushing
up overall economic growth in  Russia  in July,”  Alexander Morozov , chief economist at HSBC in Moscow, said in the
statement. “The diversion in dynamics of the service sector and
manufacturing that emerged a few months ago has further widened
in July.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
