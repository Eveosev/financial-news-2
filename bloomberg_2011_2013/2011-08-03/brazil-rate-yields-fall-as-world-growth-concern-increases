Brazil’s real strengthened for the
first time this week on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will
start another stimulus program, spurring an increase in investor
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The real rose 0.4 percent to 1.5603 per  U.S. dollar  at 5
p.m. New York time, from 1.5673 yesterday.  U.S. stocks climbed, erasing earlier losses, as investors
speculated the Fed will embark on a third round of asset
purchases to stem a recession after the Wall Street Journal said
three former central bank officials support the approach. The
U.S. equity rally sparked “an improvement in risk appetite,”
said  Nick Chamie ,the  global head of emerging markets at  RBC
Capital Markets  in Toronto.  “That’s resulting maybe in a little bit of renewed
appetite to add on real exposure,” he said by phone.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent to
1,260.34, after losing as much as 1.6 percent.  Brazil ’s central bank said it twice bought dollars in the
spot market today, first at 1.5649 reais and then at 1.5617
reais each. Purchasing the U.S. currency is part of policy
makers’ efforts to curb the real’s gains.  Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2013 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
12.51 percent. The yield on the contract due in January 2021
rose two basis points to 12.30 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
