Canadian stocks fell the most in 25
months, led by oil and metals producers, as commodity prices
tumbled on a stronger  U.S. dollar  and concern the global economy
is stalling.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Canada ’s largest oil and gas producer,
dropped 4.4 percent as crude erased its 2011 gain. Directory
publisher  Yellow Media Inc. (YLO)  plunged 43 percent after cutting its
dividend 77 percent.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX) ,
Canada’s largest drugmaker, slumped 20 percent after reporting
net income that missed analysts’ estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index decreased 435.9
points, or 3.4 percent, to a 10-month low of 12,380.13. Among
S&P/TSX stocks, 3.1 percent advanced, the least in a day since
January 2008.  “The market is really starting to understand we’re not
going to have a normal economic recovery, and the political
uncertainty we see both in  Europe  and the U.S. isn’t doing
anything for confidence,” Arthur Salzer, chief executive
officer of Northland Wealth Management, said in a telephone
interview. The firm oversees C$200 million ($205 million).  The stock benchmark fell 5 percent from July 22 to
yesterday as data on U.S. and Canadian gross domestic product,
as well as indexes of U.S. manufacturing and service-industry
businesses, trailed most economists’ forecasts.  Dollar Rallies  The U.S. dollar rose as much as 1.6 percent, gaining
against 15 of 16 other major currencies. The  Bank of Japan  sold
yen after that currency gained 11 percent from April 6 to
yesterday. Switzerland’s central bank took steps to slow
advances in the franc yesterday.  Crude oil futures dropped for a fifth day, sliding the most
since May 5. Natural gas retreated below $4 per million British
thermal units for the first time since April after the U.S.
reported stockpiles increased more than most analysts in a
Bloomberg survey had forecast.  Suncor declined 4.4 percent to C$33.12.  Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , Canada’s second-largest energy company by market
value, lost 1.7 percent to C$36.19 for an eighth-straight
retreat, the longest streak since 2002.  Encana Corp. (ECA) , Canada’s
largest natural gas producer, slid 5.3 percent to a 29-month low
of C$25.72.  Athabasca Oil Sands Corp. (ATH) , PetroChina Co.’s partner in oil
sands development, slumped 11 percent, the most since it began
trading in April 2010, to C$13.88. The company released well
results that Chad Friess, an analyst at UBS AG, and Phil Skolnick, an analyst at Canaccord Financial Inc., each called
“mixed” in notes to clients.  Raw Materials   An index of S&P/TSX raw-materials producers dropped the
most since June 2009 as all major base metals traded on the
London Metal Exchange retreated and gold slipped from a record.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , the country’s largest base-metals and
coal producer, decreased 6.7 percent to C$42.90.  First Quantum
Minerals Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s second-largest publicly traded copper
producer, fell 7.4 percent to C$116.19.  Lundin Mining Corp. (LUN) ,
which mines base metals in Europe, dropped 15 percent to C$5.67,
extending losses after reporting earnings that missed its
average analyst estimate on July 29.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest gold producer,
slipped 4.1 percent to C$45.38.  Silvercorp Metals Inc. (SVM) , which
mines in  China , declined 12 percent to C$8.78 as silver
decreased the most since May.  A gauge of financial shares slid to the lowest level since
September.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , the country’s third-biggest
lender by assets, fell 1.8 percent to C$52.30. Manulife
Financial Inc.,  North America ’s fourth-largest insurer,
decreased 3.3 percent to C$13.93.  Brookfield Asset Management
Inc. (BAM/A) , Canada’s biggest real estate company, dropped 3.5 percent
to C$28.05.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
fertilizer producer by market value, declined 4.9 percent to
C$52.47 as wheat futures decreased the most in five weeks.  Uranium producers retreated after  Cameco Corp. (CCO) , the world’s
largest producer of the nuclear fuel, cut its global demand
estimates, citing  Japan ’s nuclear crisis and  Germany ’s decision
to close reactors. Cameco lost 3.4 percent to C$23.76.  Uranium
One Inc. (UUU) , a mining company controlled by Moscow-based ARMZ
Uranium Holding, retreated 9.9 percent to C$3.09.  Buybacks, Forecasts Suspended  Yellow Media sank a record 43 percent, extending its 2011
tumble to 82 percent, to C$1.10 after cutting its dividend and
suspending stock buybacks. The company also withdrew its profit
and sales forecasts and said it will no longer provide such
estimates.  Shares of the Verdun, Quebec-based company have plunged
this year on concern the company will be unable to maintain
profit levels as fewer people use printed phone books.  Valeant slumped 20 percent, the most since July 2007, to
C$40.22 after reporting earnings excluding some items that beat
the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey by 1.9
percent. Net income of $56.36 million missed the average
projection by 51 percent.  Earnings Forecast  The pharmaceutical company forecast earnings for the third
quarter that missed some analysts’ expectations and would
represent a decline from the second quarter,  Corey Davis , an
analyst at Jefferies Group Inc. said in an e-mail.  SXC Health Solutions Corp. (SXC)  lost 7.5 percent, the most since
April 2009, to C$53.46. The pharmacy-benefits manager posted
second-quarter profit that trailed the average analyst estimate
in a Bloomberg survey by 1.3 percent, excluding certain items.  To contact the reporter on this story:
