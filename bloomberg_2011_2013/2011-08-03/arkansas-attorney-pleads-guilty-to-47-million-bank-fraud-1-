Kevin Harold Lewis, an  Arkansas 
attorney, pleaded guilty today to a fraudulent bond scheme that
caused damages of about $47 million and sent a bank into
receivership, the  Justice Department  said.  Lewis admitted to issuing fraudulent special improvement
district bonds, and one of several banks in the case, First
Southern Bank, was forced into receivership over the bonds,
according to the department’s e-mailed  statement .  “This case demonstrates that the actions of one individual
can have far-reaching, detrimental effects,” said U.S. Attorney
Christopher R. Thyer of Little Rock, Arkansas.  When sentenced, Lewis could receive as many as 30 years in
prison and a $1 million fine, prosecutors said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
