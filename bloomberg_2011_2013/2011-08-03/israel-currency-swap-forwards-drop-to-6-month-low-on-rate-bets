Israeli currency swap forwards fell
to the lowest in more than six months, suggesting the shekel
will weaken over the next year, on bets the Bank of  Israel  will
reduce the pace of interest rate increases as growth slows.  The one-year swap forwards dropped eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 3.78 percent, the lowest level since
Jan. 21 at 12 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The swaps were at 4.65 percent
on April 21, the highest level since October 2008. The shekel
weakened for a third day, declining 0.1 percent to 3.4661 per
dollar. The currency has gained 8.6 percent over the past year.  The  Bank of Israel  yesterday cut its forecasts for economic
growth to 4.8 percent in 2011 and 3.9 percent in 2012 from 5.2
percent and 4.2 percent, respectively, saying debt reduction
plans in developed countries may lead to a global slowdown.  “Signs of the  U.S. economy  recovering at a slower pace is
raising bets interest rates will stay low for a lot longer than
previously anticipated, which means the Bank of Israel will
raise its rate at a slower pace,” Amir Kahanovich, chief
economist at Clal Investment Management Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said
by telephone today. “Concern over economic growth and lower
rates is boosting demand for the relative safety of long-term
debt.”  Interest Rate  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit government bond due in
January 2020 rose, pushing the yield on the 5 percent notes down
three basis points to 4.97 percent, the lowest since July 20.
The yield on the 5.5 percent bond due in January 2022 fell three
basis points to 5.16 percent.  The  interest rate  will probably increase to an average 4.3
percent in the last quarter of 2012, the central bank said
yesterday, predicting inflation of 3.5 percent this year and 2.6
percent in 2012. The bank left its main lending rate unchanged
at 3.25 percent for a second time on July 25, after raising it
four times this year.  The CPI-linked bond due in June 2013 rose for the first
time in four days, pushing the yield down three basis points to
0.96 percent. The two-year breakeven rate was at 264.1, implying
trader expectations for an average yearly inflation rate of 2.64
percent over the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
