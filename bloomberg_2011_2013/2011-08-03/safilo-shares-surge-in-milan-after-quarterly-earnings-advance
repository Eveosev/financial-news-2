Safilo Group SpA (SFL) , the world’s second-
largest maker of eyewear, was temporarily suspended in Milan
after rising 10 percent following its announcement that second-
quarter earnings beat analyst’ estimates.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization in the three-months ending June rose 31 percent,
the Padua, Italy-based company said in a statement after the
close of trading yesterday. The company also appointed Robert Polet, the former chief executive officer of Gucci Group NV, as
chairman.  The owner of the Carrera eyeglass brand has returned to
profit after Dutch investment company Hal Holding NV injected
cash into the company, buying stock and assets.  “Polet brings enhanced credibility to Safilo, a know-how
in the luxury space and a reputation for innovation which should
help the group in its phase two post-relaunch,” Flavio Cereda,
an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a note
today. He rates the stock a “buy.”  “The picture is clear in our view: on our 3-year
projections the stock has 70 percent upside potential, worse-
case scenario is essentially in the price today.”  Shares rose as much as 11 percent and traded up 95 cents,
or 10.8 percent, at 9.78 euros as of 1:52 p.m. after the stock
resumed trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
