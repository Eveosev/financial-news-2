What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that slowing
U.S. consumer and government spending will stall the global
economic recovery and reduce grain demand,  Jim Gerlach , the
president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana, said in a
telephone interview.  -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as rising global output cuts demand for supplies
from the U.S., the worldâ€™s biggest exporter, Gerlach said.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on speculation that rain and cooler weather in August
will revive plants stunted by hot temperatures last month,
Gerlach said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open down 0.25
cent to 0.35 cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures may open $2
to $3 lower for 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
