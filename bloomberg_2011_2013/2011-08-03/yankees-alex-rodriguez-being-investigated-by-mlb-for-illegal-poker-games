Alex Rodriguez  will meet with Major
League Baseball officials this week in Baltimore to discuss
allegations the New York Yankees’ All-Star third baseman took
part in illegal poker games.  “I’ll be talking to you guys on Friday afternoon,”
Rodriguez told reporters yesterday. “I can’t wait.”  The Yankees begin a five-game road trip, which includes a
weekend doubleheader, against the  Baltimore Orioles  on Aug. 26.  Rodriguez missed last night’s 6-5 loss to the Oakland
Athletics with a sprained left thumb. He hurt himself fielding a
ground ball at Minnesota on Aug. 21, his first game since
returning from July 11 knee surgery.  Baseball Commissioner  Bud Selig  acknowledged the
investigation of the allegations against Rodriguez this month.  “We take this matter very seriously,” Selig’s office said
in the e-mail.  Rodriguez, a three-time American League Most Valuable
Player, in 2005 said he frequented illegal gambling venues. He
said at the time that it was a mistake and that he “would never
be back.”  Rodriguez, 36, played in at least two high-stakes games,
according to a report on celebrity website RadarOnline.com
citing poker professional Dan Bilzerian and another unidentified
eyewitness. Rodriguez also helped organize and participated in a
2009 poker game in Miami,  RadarOnline.com said .  To contact the reporter on this story:
