Netia SA (NET) , Poland’s second-largest
fixed-line phone company, said second-quarter profit fell 17
percent on slowing growth in the broadband market and increased
price competition.  Net income declined to 12.9 million zloty ($4.6 million)
from 15.6 million zloty a year earlier, the company said in a
regulatory statement today. That missed the 19.8 million-zloty
mean estimate by seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Slower-than-expected growth and intensifying price
competition in the broadband market made Netia reduce its
forecast for broadband customers by the end of this year to
750,000 from a previous estimate of 780,000 to 800,000, the
company said in a separate statement. Netia had 719,595 such
clients at the end of June.  The company maintained its guidance that 2011 sales will
exceed 1.61 billion zloty.  “Despite the current tough market conditions, I am
confident that we are laying the right foundations to accelerate
our growth rate once more in the coming quarters,” Chief
Executive Officer Miroslaw Godlewski said in a statement. “We
see several interesting acquisition opportunities on the Polish
market.”  Netia shares fell 3.7 percent to a five-month low of 5.19
zloty as of 9:40 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
