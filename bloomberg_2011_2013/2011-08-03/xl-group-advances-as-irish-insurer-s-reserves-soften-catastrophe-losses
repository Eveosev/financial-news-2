XL Group Plc (XL)  gained the most since
May 2010 as profit at the insurer surged, aided by reserves that
absorbed catastrophe losses.  XL rose $1.75, or 8.7 percent, to $21.77 at 4:01 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, ranking it among the
day’s three biggest gainers in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
The stock traded as high as $21.88 during the session.  Second-quarter net income climbed 18 percent to $225.7
million, or 69 cents a share, the Dublin-based company said
yesterday in a statement. Losses tied to natural disasters were
$68.3 million for the three months ended June 30. XL provides
insurance and reinsurance coverage.  “Tornado losses were more than offset by robust reserve
releases,”  Cliff Gallant , an analyst with KBW Inc., said in a
note to investors today. He rates the stock “market perform.”  XL resumed share buybacks in the second quarter and
repurchased 4.3 million shares for $92.3 million. Since June 30,
XL has bought an additional 7.3 million shares for $157.7
million as part of a previously announced $1 billion share
program, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
