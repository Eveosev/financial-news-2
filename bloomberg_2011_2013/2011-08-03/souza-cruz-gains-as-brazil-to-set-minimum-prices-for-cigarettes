Souza Cruz SA (CRUZ3) ,  Brazil ’s biggest
tobacco company, rose for the first time in four sessions after
a government official said Brazil will set minimum prices for
cigarettes as it seeks to avoid tax evasion.  Shares climbed 0.5 percent to 17.82 reais at the close of
trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, after earlier jumping as
much as 2.6 percent. The Bovespa tumbled 2.3 percent to
56,017.22.  A minimum price for cigarettes would be positive for big
tobacco companies because it could stop smaller rivals from
evading taxes in order to sell cheaper cigarettes, Caue
Pinheiro, an analyst at SLW Corretora, said in a telephone
interview. “This measure would be good for Souza Cruz.”  The government plans to release a decree with the minimum
prices for cigarettes next week, Marcelo Fisch, an auditor at
the tax agency, told reporters today in Brasilia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
