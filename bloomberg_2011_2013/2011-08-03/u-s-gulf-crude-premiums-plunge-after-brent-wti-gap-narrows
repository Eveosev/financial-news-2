U.S. Gulf oil premiums weakened as
the discount of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude to Brent
narrowed.  The gap decreased 67 cents to $22 a barrel as of 12:15 p.m.
in  New York . Yesterday’s spread of $22.67 was a record, based on
closing prices.  When Brent declines versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 30 cents to $23.70
a barrel at 12:15 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet lost $1.50 a barrel to $24
over WTI.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend narrowed 65 cents to $19.85 while Poseidon’s lost 55 cents
to $19.85 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium dropped $1.75 to $17.75 a
barrel over WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount widened 10 cents to
90 cents below the benchmark. Thunder Horse’s premium slipped
$1.75 a barrel to $23.25.  Syncrude Premium  The premium for Syncrude over WTI increased to the highest
since at least 2006 late yesterday after  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
said processing rates were reduced for unplanned work at its
Albian Sands oil processing site in  Canada .  The Hague-based company has been carrying out work on the
unit since mid-July, Stephen Doolan, a Shell spokesman, said in
an e-mail yesterday. The maintenance is scheduled to be finished
“in the coming days,” said Doolan, who is based in Calgary.  Canadian Oil Sands Ltd., the largest holder in the Syncrude
Canada Ltd oil-sands venture,  said yesterday  that July
production was affected by unplanned maintenance on a diluents
recovery unit. The work has been completed, according to the
company statement.  July Syncrude production increased 12.9 percent to an
average of 323,800 barrels a day from 286,800 barrels a day the
previous month, Canadian Oil Sands said.  The premium for Syncrude for September delivery was
unchanged today after climbing $2.75 to $18 a barrel yesterday.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$17.70.  To contact the reporter on this story:
