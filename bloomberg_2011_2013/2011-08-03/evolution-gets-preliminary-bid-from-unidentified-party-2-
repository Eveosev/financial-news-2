Evolution Group Plc (EVG)  received an
approach about a possible takeover, sending the London-based
brokerage’s shares up by 8.5 percent.  “This approach is at a very early stage, and the board is
far from certain that it will ultimately result in an offer
being made,” Evolution said in a statement today, without
naming the suitor. A London-based spokeswoman declined to
comment beyond the statement.  Brokers in the U.K. have sought to consolidate after the
credit crisis cut financing for takeovers, hurting revenue from
advising on fundraisings and mergers. Panmure Gordon & Co., a
rival stockbroker, spurned overtures from Evolution last year.
Evolution said last week that first-half profit climbed 12
percent as funds under management increased.  Evolution’s shares rose the most in more than five months
to 79.75 pence at the close of trading in  London , bringing the
broker’s market value to about 186 million pounds ($305
million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
