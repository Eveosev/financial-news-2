Russia ’s RTS stock-index futures rose
on speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may consider
another stimulus program to prevent a recession, reducing
concern that growth in the world’s largest economy will falter.  Futures on the dollar-denominated index expiring in
September climbed 0.9 percent yesterday. Contracts on OAO
Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil producer, gained 0.9 percent and
those on OAO Lukoil, Russia’s second-biggest oil producer, rose
0.4 percent. Futures on VTB Group, Russia’s second-largest
lender, advanced 1 percent. Oil is Russia’s top export.  U.S. stocks rebounded after the Wall Street Journal
reported that three former top officials at the Fed believe the
central bank may consider a new round of securities purchases to
bolster growth. The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  dropped 3.4 percent to
1,655.36 in Moscow yesterday.  “The market was oversold in panic in the main session, and
now investors in the evening session are slowly covering their
hedges as the market seems to have stabilized,”  Luis Saenz ,
chief executive officer of Otkritie Capital’s U.S. unit, wrote
in e-mailed comments from London. Russian futures were
“supported later by the news that the Fed may do a fresh round
of security purchases,” Saenz added.  Crude for September delivery dropped 2 percent to $91.93 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , falling to a five-
week low on concern that a faltering U.S. economy will generate
less demand.  The euro was little changed against the dollar at 1.4325 at
5:15 p.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
