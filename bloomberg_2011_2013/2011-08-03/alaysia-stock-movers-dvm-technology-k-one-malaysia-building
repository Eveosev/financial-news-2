Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in Malaysia trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 5 p.m. local-time close in
 Kuala Lumpur .  The  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBMKLCI)  Index fell 9.75 points, or 0.6
percent, to 1,545.10, the lowest close since May 30.       Catcha Media Bhd. (CHM MK) jumped 28 percent to 72.5 sen,
the biggest gain since its debut on July 22, after Justin Leong,
Genting Bhd.’s head of strategic investment and corporate
affairs, bought a 5 percent stake in the publisher and online
media business operator. Leong acquired 6.66 million shares in
the open market on Aug. 1, a stock-exchange filing showed.        K-One Technology Bhd. (KONE)  , an electronics components
maker, slid 3.8 percent to 38 sen, its lowest close since June
7. The Securities Commission rejected K-One’s proposed listing
transfer to the stock exchange’s main market from the Ace Market
because it didn’t comply with the regulator’s equity guidelines.        Malaysia Building Society (MBS)  Bhd, a mortgage
financing provider, rose 7.7 percent to 1.68 ringgit, its
highest close since May 26, after second-quarter net income
