A party in Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff ’s coalition withdrew its support for the government in
the Senate after some of its officials were purged from the
Transportation Ministry as part of an anti-corruption crackdown.  The Party of the Republic, or PR, will no longer caucus
with five other parties providing unconditional support to
Rousseff’s coalition in the Senate, Sen. Magno Malta, the
party’s leader in the upper chamber, said yesterday. The PR
won’t break with the government completely by joining the
opposition, he said.  “We’ll support what’s good and what interests the
country,” Malta said in a telephone interview from Brasilia.  The withdrawal comes after Rousseff last month forced out
Transportation Minister Alfredo Nascimento and dozens of PR
allies at the ministry over allegations of overbilling and
kickbacks. Opposition politicians collected enough signatures
yesterday to open a congressional probe into the allegations.  Rousseff’s Workers’ Party, or PT, lacks a majority in
Congress, so the president relies on support from other parties
to approve  legislation . Nascimento’s PR has six senators in the
81-seat upper chamber and 40 deputies in the 513-member lower
house.  The president’s move to clean house in a ministry that is
central to preparations for the 2014  World Cup  and the 2016
 Summer Olympics  has roiled members of her  coalition  even while
winning support from middle-class voters who are growing in
political importance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
