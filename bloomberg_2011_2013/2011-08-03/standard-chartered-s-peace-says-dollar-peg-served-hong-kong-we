John Peace, chairman of  Standard
Chartered Plc (2888) , comments on Hong Kong’s exchange rate system at a
press conference today.  On the Hong Kong dollar’s peg to U.S. currency:  “These are very uncertain times. I think the peg to the
dollar has served Hong Kong very well in the last 10-20 years.
And it’s far too premature to start talking about linking it to
some other currency or some other basket of currency.  ‘‘At this time, given all the uncertainties in the world
today, what Hong Kong has done so far in managing the economy
has worked well and I simply wouldn’t change it at the time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
