ArcelorMittal (MT) ’s Kazakh unit will
invest about $150 million to upgrade one of its blast furnaces
as it seeks to expand steel output.  ArcelorMittal Temirtau plans to complete talks with a
contractor and start the upgrade soon, Chief Executive Officer
Frank Pannier said today in a company statement sent by e-mail.
The work will be done by July 2013 and help to boost the
furnace’s capacity by 70 percent to 6,300 metric tons of cast
iron a day, it said.  The unit of the world’s biggest steelmaker said in February
it planned to produce 4 million tons of liquid steel this year
and 6 million tons by 2015. That compares with 3.34 million tons
in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
