German stocks fell, with the
benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  dropping 12 percent from this year’s high,
as concern escalated that the U.S. economy is faltering and the
nation may lose its top  credit rating .  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  and  Salzgitter AG (SZG) ,  Germany ’s biggest
steelmakers, dropped with metal prices. Daimler AG and
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  led a selloff in European carmakers.  Axel Springer
AG (SPR)  rose 9.7 percent after saying that first-half operating
profit climbed 11 percent.  The DAX declined 2.3 percent to 6,640.59 at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Frankfurt, its lowest close since March 16. The measure
has dropped 12 percent since this year’s high on May 2 as
investors speculated that Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis would
derail its economic recovery. A drop of 10 percent from the most
recent peak is known as a correction by analysts. The broader
HDAX Index lost 2.4 percent today.  “Stalling economic growth across the pond has put a lot of
pressure on equities and shifted the attention back to recession
issues again,” said Anita Paluch, a sales trader at ETX Capital
in  London . “In  Europe , additional strain is coming from the
fact that seemingly averted Greek problems are still floating
around.”  Moody’s Investors Service said the outlook for the U.S.
debt grade is negative after President Barack Obama yesterday
signed into law a plan to lift the nation’s borrowing limit and
cut spending following months of wrangling between Republican
and Democrat lawmakers. Moody’s and Fitch Ratings affirmed their
AAA credit ratings for the U.S., while warning that downgrades
were possible if politicians failed to implement debt-reduction
measures and the economy weakened.  U.S. Services, Factories  German stocks extended their losses after a report showed
that U.S. service industries expanded in July at the slowest
pace since February 2010, a sign that the largest part of the
 U.S. economy  had little momentum at the start of the second half
of the year.  A separate release showed that American factories received
fewer orders in June, reflecting declining demand for machinery
and computers that signal manufacturing may struggle to
accelerate. Data from ADP Employer Services showed that
companies in the U.S. added 114,000 workers to their payrolls in
July. The increase followed a revised 145,000 gain in June that
was lower than previously reported.  Salzgitter slid 7.6 percent to 43.30 euros, the lowest
price since April 2009. ThyssenKrupp plunged 4.5 percent to
27.26 euros, its lowest price since March. A gauge of basic-
resource shares was the second-worst performing of 19 industries
in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index today as aluminum, copper, lead,
nickel, tin and zinc all retreated on the London Metal Exchange.  Daimler, Volkswagen Drop  The preferred shares of Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest
carmaker, sank 4.6 percent to 126.30 euros. The stock has
retreated 9.4 percent this week, its biggest three-day decline
since November 2009.  Daimler AG (DAI) , the third-largest maker of
luxury cars, tumbled 4.4 percent to 45.33 euros.  The preferred shares of  Fuchs Petrolub AG (FPE)  slumped 9.8
percent to 32.93 euros, its largest retreat since May 2009, as
the maker of lubricants reported second-quarter net income and
earnings before interest and taxes that missed analysts’
estimates.  Axel Springer , Europe’s largest newspaper publisher, jumped
9.7 percent to 31.77 euros, the biggest gain since May 2009.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
increased to 288.7 million euros ($413 million) from 261.2
million euros a year earlier, the Berlin-based company said in a
statement today. Sales increased 12 percent to 1.53 billion
euros.  Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG (HDD)  surged 4.2 percent to 1.78
euros, rebounding from its lowest price since at least 1998. The
maker of printing presses acquired CSAT GmbH, based in
Eggenstein near Karlsruhe, which employs 70 people, the company
said in an e-mailed statement today, adding that both parties
agreed to keep the purchase price confidential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
