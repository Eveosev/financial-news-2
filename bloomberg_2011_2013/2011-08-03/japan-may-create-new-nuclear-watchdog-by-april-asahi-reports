The Japanese government may create a
new nuclear safety agency under the environment ministry by
April, the Asahi newspaper  reported .  The government plans to form the new agency by merging the
Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, currently under the trade
ministry, with the Nuclear Safety Commission of  Japan , the
newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.  NISA’s lack of independence from the trade ministry, which
promotes the use of atomic power, hampered a quick response to
the disaster at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant this year, the government said in a report to the
 International Atomic Energy Agency  in June. Chubu Electric Power
Co. said last week the NISA had asked the utility to prepare
questions favoring atomic power for a public hearing in 2007.  The environment ministry is expected to make a distinction
between safety regulations on nuclear power and promotion of its
use, the Asahi reported, citing an unidentified official at the
ruling  Democratic Party  of Japan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
