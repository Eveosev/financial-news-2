Russian stocks plunged the most in
more than three months after oil and metals fell as signs of a
slowing U.S. economy damped investor demand for commodities.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks retreated 3.4 percent to
1,655.36 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its largest fall
since April 18. Oil producers OAO Tatneft and OAO Gazprom Neft
dropped 5 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively. OAO Sberbank,
the country’s biggest lender, slid 3 percent. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index slumped 3.4 percent to 1,901.73.  Crude,  Russia ’s main export earner, dropped as much as
$2.04 to $91.75 a barrel in  New York  as U.S. service industries
expanded in July at the slowest pace since February 2010 as
orders and employment cooled. Moody’s Investors Service said
yesterday the nation’s credit rating may be downgraded.  “Russia is clearly in capitulation mode,”  Luis Saenz ,
chief executive officer of Otkritie Capital’s U.S. unit, wrote
in e-mailed comments from  London .  Stocks extended declines after the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s index of non-manufacturing businesses decreased to
52.7 in July from 53.3 a month earlier. A reading above 50
signals expansion. The measure was projected to rise to 53.5,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey  “ Risk aversion  is intensifying,” Julian Rimmer, a trader
of Russian shares at CF Global Trading in London, said by phone
in London. “But for the Russian market to collapse, it would
require a serious collapse in the oil price.”  Copper for September delivery slid 1.1 percent $4.3485 a
pound on the Comex in New York, a three-week low. All metals
traded on the London Metal Exchange declined, led by nickel and
tin. OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, Russia’s largest mining company,
decreased 2.5 percent to 7,250 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
