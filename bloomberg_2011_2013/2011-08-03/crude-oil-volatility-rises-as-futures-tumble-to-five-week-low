Oil options volatility increased as
futures tumbled to a five-week low on concern that a faltering
economy will curb fuel demand in the U.S., the worldâ€™s largest
oil-consuming country.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 33.9 percent at 1 p.m. in  New York ,
up from 33.1 percent yesterday.  Oil for September delivery dropped $2.27, or 2.4 percent,
to $91.52 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
have risen 11 percent in the past year.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
September $90 puts, with 3,790 lots changing hands as of 1:40
p.m. in New York. They gained 39 cents to $1.57 a barrel.
September $100 calls, the next-most active option, fell 26 cents
to 24 cents a barrel with 3,609 lots trading. One contract
covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  September $90 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 5,588 lots changing hands. They advanced 15
cents to $1.18 a barrel. The next-most active options, October
$80 puts, increased 7 cents to 69 cents a barrel on volume of
4,307.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 46,243
contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 45,345 and
