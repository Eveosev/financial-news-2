South Korean banks’ combined profit
more than quadrupled last quarter, boosted by gains from the
sale of stakes in Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. and
lower provisions for bad debts.  Net income at the 18 lenders climbed to 5.9 trillion won
($5.5 billion) for the three months ended June 30 on a
preliminary basis, from a revised 1.3 trillion won a year
earlier, the  Financial Supervisory Service  said today.  The nation’s largest lenders including Kookmin Bank, Woori
Bank and  Shinhan Bank  booked a combined 3.2 trillion won before-
tax gain last quarter as they sold a combined 35 percent stake
in Hyundai Engineering. The lenders held the stake in  South
Korea ’s largest builder by converting debt into equity when they
helped bail out the contractor in 2001.  South Korea’s four biggest financial holding companies --
 KB Financial Group Inc. (105560) , Woori Finance Holdings Co., Shinhan
Financial Group Co. and  Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790)  -- all
reported higher earnings last quarter.  Loan-loss provisions at the 18 lenders dropped to 2
trillion won from 5.4 trillion won a year earlier, today’s
statement showed. Net interest margin, a measure of lending
profitability, climbed to 2.33 percent from 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
