Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , which is
seeking approval for an $8.5 billion mortgage-bond settlement,
was sued by investors that want the bank to buy back loans
underlying their securities.  Bank of America must buy back the loans because its
Countrywide Financial unit breached representations and
warranties about them, Walnut Place LLC and related entities
said in a complaint filed yesterday in New York State Supreme
Court.  The lawsuit comes as Bank of America is seeking court
approval to pay $8.5 billion to resolve claims from mortgage
investors and avoid repurchasing loans packaged into bonds by
Countrywide.  Walnut Place has “serious concerns about the adequacy of
the settlement and the conflicts of interest of the parties that
negotiated it,” the company said in the complaint.
“Countrywide and Bank of America agreed to pay only
$8.5 billion as a settlement of claims that are worth many times
that amount.”  Walnut Place previously sued Bank of America over a
different trust that holds  mortgage loans  and issued securities
to investors.  Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for  Charlotte , North
Carolina-based Bank of America, declined to comment on the new
complaint.  The case is Walnut Place LLC v. Countrywide Home Loans Inc,
652146-2011, New York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
