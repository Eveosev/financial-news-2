Bulgaria ’s customs service appealed
against a court ruling that allowed OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-
biggest oil company, to resume refinery operations following a
dispute over measuring production to calculate excise duty.  The ruling at a court in Sofia failed to properly take into
account the reasons for the government’s decision to block sales
and imports at the Lukoil Neftochim Burgas refinery or the 15
months the unit had to comply, the agency said by e-mail today.  The government last week withdrew permits for the Black Sea
plant, which supplies as much as 40 percent of Bulgaria’s fuel,
after the  Finance Ministry  said Lukoil failed to install gauges
that allow authorities to remotely calculate duty. Bulgaria has
asked fuel companies to put the measuring devices in place,
partly in an attempt to reduce  tax evasion .  Lukoil’s unit has said it borrowed $11 million to install
the devices by the end of the year. The refinery, capable of
processing 177,000 barrels of crude oil a day, resumed output
and sales yesterday. Telephone calls to the plant today from
Bloomberg News seeking comment weren’t picked up.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
