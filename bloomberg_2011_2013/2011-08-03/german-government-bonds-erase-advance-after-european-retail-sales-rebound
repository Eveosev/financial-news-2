German  government bonds  erased an
advance after European retail sales rebounded more than
predicted in June from a drop in the previous month.  The benchmark 10-year bund yield was little changed at 2.41
percent as of 10:14 a.m. in London.  The yield earlier fell as much as eight basis points to
2.33 percent, the least since Oct. 15.  Sales in the 17-nation euro region grew 0.9 percent from
May, when they fell 1.3 percent, the European Unionâ€™s statistics
office in Luxembourg said today. Economists had projected a gain
of 0.5 percent, the median of 22 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
