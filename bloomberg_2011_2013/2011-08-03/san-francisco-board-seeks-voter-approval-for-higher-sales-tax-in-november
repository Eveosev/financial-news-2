San Francisco ’s Board of Supervisors
agreed to add a measure to the November ballot seeking an
increase in the city’s  sales-tax  rate to 9 percent to pay for
public-safety programs as well as child and senior services.  The city’s sales tax, currently 8.5 percent, would be
increased 0.5 percent for 10 years, according to  language 
approved today by the board, San Francisco’s city council.  “We are seeking to restore the sales tax locally by one
half of one cent to protect public-safety programs and preserve
the social safety net for our city’s most vulnerable,” Mayor
Edwin Lee said today in a statement.  The city’s sales levy fell by 1 percentage point last
month, after Republicans in the state Legislature stymied
Governor  Jerry Brown ’s plan to extend temporary tax increases
and fees that expired June 30. When the statewide levy on retail
purchases fell, it pushed the city’s rate down from 9.5 percent.  Lee said the drop left a “huge hole” in the state budget
that has been filled by cuts in funding to local programs and
shifting responsibility for state functions to local
governments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
