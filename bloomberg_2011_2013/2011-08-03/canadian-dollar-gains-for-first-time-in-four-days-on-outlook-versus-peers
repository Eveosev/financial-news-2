Canada ’s dollar touched the lowest
level in three weeks as crude oil dropped and U.S. service
industries grew at the slowest pace since February 2010, adding
to concern Canada’s largest trading partner is faltering.  Canada’s 30-year government bonds snapped six days of
gains, with the yield earlier touching 3.14 percent, the lowest
level in  Bank of Canada  records dating to 1970. The loonie pared
losses as U.S. stocks advanced after dropping.  “We see commodities down on this view that the  U.S.
economy  is slowing,” said Gregory Salvaggio, senior vice
president of capital markets in  Washington  at the currency
trader Tempus Consulting Inc. “The Canadian dollar is
ultimately going to suffer, and that’s exactly what we’re seeing
happen today.”  The Canadian currency fell 0.1 percent to 96.21 cents
against the  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in  New York , compared with
96.13 yesterday, after touching 96.47, the weakest level since
July 13. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0394. It rallied on July 26
to 94.07 cents, the strongest since November 2007.  The 30-year government bond rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.19 percent after falling earlier to the
record low. The price of the 4 percent security maturing in June
2041 dropped 44 cents to C$115.59.  U.S. Services  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s non-manufacturing
index for the U.S. fell to 52.7 in July from 53.3 in the
previous month, the Tempe, Arizona-based group reported today.
Readings above 50 signal expansion, and the median forecast of
75 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for an increase to
53.5 last month.  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, dropped 2
percent to $91.90 a barrel, after touching 91.22 its lowest
level in more than a month. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
index of raw materials fell 1.3 percent.  “Signs of slowing in the U.S. and globally have put
significant downward pressure on commodity prices, so look at
the sell-off in crude oil today as another factor that’s driving
the Canadian dollar to pare some of its recent gains,” said
 Omer Esiner , chief market analyst in Washington at Commonwealth
Foreign Exchange Inc., a currency brokerage.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.5 percent after
seven consecutive days of losses. The S&P/TSX Composite Index
rose 0.5 percent after sliding 1.5 percent.  Loonie Versus Franc  Against the Swiss franc, the loonie gained 1 percent to
80.07 centimes after earlier rallying 2.5 percent. The Canadian
dollar slid 0.2 percent to 80.10 yen.  The franc tumbled earlier against all of its most-traded
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg after the  Swiss National Bank 
unexpectedly cut  interest rates  to weaken the currency and
support  Switzerland ’s economy.  The Swiss currency has soared 25 percent in the past 12
months, making it the best performer among 10 developed-nation
peers including the loonie in Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Currency Indexes.  The Canadian dollar rose versus the greenback earlier today
after ADP Employer Services reported that U.S. companies added
114,000 workers in July. The median forecast of 39 economists in
a Bloomberg News survey was for an advance of 100,000. The Labor
Department’s payrolls report on Aug. 5 is forecast to show an
increase of 85,000 jobs.  Canadian employers added a net 15,000 workers to payrolls
in July, according to the median forecast of 26 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Statistics Canada  is due to release
figures at 7 a.m. in Ottawa the day after tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
