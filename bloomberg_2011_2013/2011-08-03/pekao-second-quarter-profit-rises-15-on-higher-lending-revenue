Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  said second-quarter
profit rose 15 percent as  Poland ’s second-largest lender boosted
revenue from loans.  Net income climbed to 714.3 million zloty ($251.8 million)
from 619.1 million zloty a year earlier, the bank said in a
regulatory statement today. That beat the 688.5 million-zloty
average estimate of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. First-
half profit totaled 1.36 billion zloty.  Pekao net interest income, the difference between what it
pays on deposits and what it charges for loans, rose 13 percent
to 1.13 billion zloty, while fees and provisions increased 10
percent to 644.6 million zloty, the bank said.  Banking profits in Poland surged 41 percent in 2010 and the
industry continues to benefit from an expanding economy, which
is expected to grow by about 4 percent this year and next,
according to government estimates. Banks forecast their combined
earnings will rise about 26 percent in 2011, a survey conducted
by the country’s financial regulator said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
