It's possible that, in the long view, 2011 will be seen as Indian democracy's summer of discontent. It's hard to escape the sense of simmering mass unrest bred by the cynicism and cupidity of the political class. In the capital, the UPA coalition government, led by the Indian National Congress, has been rocked by corruption scandals and forced to deal with huge protests organized by groups in civil society. In Mumbai, a series of bomb blasts on July 13 led to a  backlash  against the state government's inability to protect its citizens. The dominant issue in Parliament and among the public is the  Lokpal Bill , seen by its proponents as a radical anti-corruption measure. The latest episode in this year's extended drama of political distrust and dishonor occurred July 31, when the chief minister of the south Indian state of Karnataka,  BS Yeddyurappa , reluctantly  handed in his resignation  after being implicated in a mining scam. The Telegraph  reported : Yeddyurappa's resignation was significant for at least three reasons. First, he was toppled not by a no-confidence motion in the Karnataka Assembly or by a judgement against him in a court, but by  a damning report  on illegal mining in Karnataka produced by Santosh Hegde, the Lokayukta of Karnataka. The Lokayukta is an independent ombudsman appointed to look into complaints about the state administration. So it might be said that while the revelation of a chief minister's abuse of his powers was yet another blot on Indian democracy, the fact that it was achieved by an ombudsman's report was a sign that some of the checks and balances in the system are working. Second, Yeddyurappa's ouster has political ramifications. He belongs to the main opposition party in Parliament, the  Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP). It was primarily through Yeddyurappa's influence as a mass leader (he belongs to the influential  Lingayat caste , one of the largest of Karnataka) that the BJP had, in 2008, established its first-ever government in Karnataka or, for that matter, in any of the states of the Indian south, an area where it has historically had very little influence. The BJP had so far taken the moral high ground on corruption. In order to keep up its campaign against the national government, the party was forced to take action against Yeddyurappa. But the deposed chief minister isn't the principal accused in the report. The main ones are the  notorious Reddy brothers of Bellary  -- Gali Karunakar Reddy, Gali Janardhan Reddy and Gali Somashekhar Reddy -- who have made massive fortunes from  iron-ore  mining, are the prime funders of the BJP in Karnataka, and are all ministers in the present Karnataka government. The brothers rule over what is sometimes called " The Republic of Bellary ," flouting laws with impunity and hounding and intimidating business rivals and critics. More heads may roll in Karnataka in the months to come, leading to further embarrassment for the party. Third, Hegde's 25,000 page report is one of the most detailed and revealing documents ever published about the methods and stratagems of political corruption in India, and therefore contains intelligence not just particular to this case but of a general nature. It reveals the systematic plunder of the country's natural resources by ruthless entrepreneurs in cahoots with political parties. The report indicted  six ministers, 784 bureaucrats and 100 firms , providing an extensive map of the networks that have created what some have called " the split personality " of  India 's extraordinary economic boom in the last decade. It puts the scale of loss to the Exchequer at an astounding $3.5 billion, which could make this, as one commentator put it, " the most brazen scandal in independent India ." In a report called " Anatomy of Bellary Mining Loot, " the Economic Times said: In one of the most revealing pieces about the Yeddyurappa affair and the state of Karnataka politics, " The Baron Might Go. The Robbery Goes On, " the journalist Ashok Malik wrote: And the columnist Paranjoy  Guha Thakurta  drew attention to how Hegde's report showed that parties across the political spectrum were complicit in the same kinds of robber-baron economic activity. Guha Thakurta wrote: A version of Guha's point was made recently by the economist Vivek Dehejia, who argued recently in a piece in the International Herald Tribune called " After The Robber Barons ": And last, an interesting footnote to the Yeddyurappa affair was the influence on the former chief minister not so much of political rent-seekers as the moon. When Yeddyurappa was finally persuaded by the BJP's national high command to resign, he insisted he would not do so in the month of Ashadh in the  Hindu lunar calendar , because this is considered an inauspicious time. His  resignation statement  to the press read: "The month of Ashada will be over on 30th July on the New Moon day or Amavasya. I will be tendering my resignation as Chief Minister on the forenoon of 31st July 2011." Inauspicious time over, the former chief minister  promptly moved  the Karnataka High Court against the Lokayukta's report, demanding that the chapter dealing with him be quashed. On the same day, Lokayukta Santosh Hegde's five-year term ended, and he  retired from his post  after a job well done.
