Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,  Australia ’s
biggest gold producer, said 10 people were killed after a
helicopter chartered by its joint venture with PT Aneka Tambang
crashed yesterday in  Indonesia .  Two Australian residents, two  South Africans  and four
Indonesians were passengers on the flight piloted by two
Indonesians, the Melbourne-based company said today in a
 statement . The Gosowong mine was suspended from operation, it
said in a separate statement.  The helicopter was flying from Manado on Sulawesi Island to
the Gosowong mine on Halmahera island when it crashed near
Manado, the company said. The cause of the incident, which
occurred about 2:30 p.m. local time yesterday, isn’t yet known,
it said.  “The passengers were from the exploration and information
technology divisions and no-one is part of the management team
as far as I know,” Kadar Wiryanto, a spokesman for the joint
venture company PT Nusa Halmahera Minerals, said today by phone.
“We’re still gathering more information on the crash and will
only be able to give an update later today.”  The Gosowong mine produced 136,343 ounces of gold in the
June quarter. Newcrest is considering developing a second
underground mining front at the operation, it said in its
quarterly report last month.  “Consular officers from the Australian embassy in Jakarta
are keeping in close contact with Newcrest Mining and have
offered all consular assistance,” Mary Bagnall, a spokeswoman
for Australia’s Department of  Foreign Affairs  and Trade, said
today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
