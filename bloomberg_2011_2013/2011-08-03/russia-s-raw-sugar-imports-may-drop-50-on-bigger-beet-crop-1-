Russia  may cut it sugar imports by 50
percent because of a bigger domestic sugar beet crop, said
Andrei Bodin, head of the country’s Sugar Producers Union.  The sugar beet crop may result in record sugar production
of 4.3 million metric tons for the 2011-12 season, up 59 percent
from a year earlier, Evgeny Ivanov, an analyst at Russia’s
Institute for Agricultural Market Studies, or IKAR, said from
Moscow. Production from imports will be down 50 percent to
about 1 million tons, Bodin said by phone in Moscow. The crop 
year runs from Aug. 1 to July 31.  Imports will account for less than 22 percent of Russia’s
sugar production this year compared with 42 percent last year,
IKAR said. Cargill Inc., Sucden SA, Louis Dreyfus Corp. and
Vitol SA were the largest sellers of raw sugar from cane to
Russia last year, according to IKAR.  To contact the reporter on this story:
