U.S. stocks erased losses amid
speculation Federal Reserve policy makers were considering
another stimulus program to prevent the nation from slipping
into a recession.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,255.21 at 1:55 p.m. in  New York  after losing as much as 1.6
percent in morning trading. Stocks recovered as the Wall Street
Journal reported that three former top officials at the Fed
believe the central bank may consider a new round of securities
purchases to bolster growth.  Pacific Investment Management Co. and BlackRock Inc., which
together oversee almost $5 trillion, say the U.S. economy is
stalling.  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond fund at
Pimco, and  Peter Fisher , head of fixed income at BlackRock, have
said the Fed is preparing measures to counter the slowdown.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
