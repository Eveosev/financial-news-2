Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the world’s fourth-
largest energy company, said its Nigerian Escravos gas-to-
liquids plant is more than 70 percent complete and on course to
start production in 2013.  The facility, which will refine natural gas to produce
33,000 barrels a day of fuels including diesel, is set “to be
completed at the end of 2012,” Andrew Fawthrop, chief executive
officer of the company’s Nigerian unit, said in an interview
yesterday in Abuja, the capital.  Chevron holds a 75 percent interest and will operate the
estimated $8.4 billion project jointly developed with the state-
owned  Nigeria  National Petroleum Corp., he said.  Nigeria, holder of  Africa ’s largest gas reserves of about
187 trillion cubic feet, burns off, or flares, most of the fuel
it produces along with oil because it lacks the infrastructure
to process it. At least $3 billion in revenue is lost annually
due to flaring, according to the Petroleum Ministry. The country
flared 15.2 billion cubic meters last year, according to the
 World Bank ’s  Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership .  Chevron’s daily  production  in Nigeria averaged 524,000
barrels of crude, 206 million cubic feet (5.8 million cubic
meters) of natural gas and 5,000 barrels of liquefied petroleum
gas in 2010 as security improved in the oil-rich Niger River
delta, according to the company.  The company holds interests in 10 deepwater oil blocks in
Nigeria, including its 250,000 barrels per day Agbami field
located 70 miles (113 kilometers) off the country’s coast. A 10-
well development program within the next three years is expected
to boost output to offset declining production in the field.  “We’re continuing the development of the Agbami field and
we’re looking for new opportunities in deepwater continuously,”
Fawthrop said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
