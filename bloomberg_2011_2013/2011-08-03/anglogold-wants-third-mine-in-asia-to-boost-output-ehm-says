AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , the world’s
third-biggest gold miner, said it wants to “bolt on” a third
mine in Australasia to boost production in the region to about 1
million ounces a year.  “We would like to be getting ourselves up to 1 million
ounces,” Graham Ehm, executive vice president of Australasia at
Johannesburg-based AngloGold, said in an interview in Kalgoorlie,
Western  Australia . “That means to bolt on another Tropicana or
Sunrise Dam.”  AngloGold owns the Sunrise Dam operation in  Western
Australia , producing 396,000 ounces last year, and a 70 percent
stake in the state’s Tropicana project that may yield as much as
490,000 ounces annually. Gold producers are boosting output as
record prices in London head for an 11th straight annual gain.  “The cheapest way to do this” would be to find another
gold deposit in Anglo’s existing regional portfolio or invest in
a project at an early stage of development, Ehm said. Anglo
would search for such opportunities throughout the region
because of high asset prices in Australia. “It’s tough in
Australia to find an opportunity which would make sense.”  Anglo remains interested to buy out  Independence Group NL (IGO) ,
owner of the remaining 30 percent in the $700 million Tropicana
project.  “They know we’re interested,” said Ehm. “Owning 100
percent of a good deposit is better than 70 percent.”  Natixis Commodity Markets Ltd. raised its 2012 estimate to
$1,300 from $1,140 an ounce on July 28 as the debt crisis in
 Europe  and the U.S. spurs investor demand for the metal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
