Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said its
Nigerian joint venture will pay compensation for two oil spills
in 2008 in the country’s Niger Delta.  The Shell Petroleum Development Co. of Nigeria, which Shell
operates as a joint venture with partners Eni SpA,  Total SA (FP)  and
the Nigerian government, said in an e-mailed statement today
that the spills were caused by the company.  “SPDC will pay compensation in accordance with Nigerian
law,” said The Hague-based company, which is being sued because
of the spills. “The legal process is continuing and could take
several months to reach a conclusion.”  The joint venture spilled an estimated 10 million gallons
of crude and may be liable for hundreds of millions of pounds in
damages, said Martyn Day, a senior partner with Leigh Day & Co.
in  London  who is representing the region’s Bodo community.  Shell owns 30 percent of the joint venture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
