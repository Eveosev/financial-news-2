Uganda ’s shilling, the worst
performing currency in the past two months, weakened against the
dollar for a sixth day as companies bought the U.S. currency to
pay for imports.  The shilling was depreciated 0.4 and traded at 2,660 by
5:10 p.m. in the capital, Kampala, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It closed at 2,650 yesterday. The shilling’s six-day
decline is the longest losing streak in six weeks.  “There is new demand for the dollar in the market as
different companies begin their cycle at the beginning of the
month,” Benon Okwenje, a currency trader at Stanbic Uganda
Ltd., said by phone from Kampala. In general, “the market was
very quiet today.”  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer has
depreciated 9.8 percent against the dollar in two months, the
biggest drop among more than 170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg
worldwide. A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a
more than 18-year high of 18.7 percent this month from 15.7
percent in June, the statistics office said on July 29.  The central bank yesterday raised its benchmark  interest
rate  by 1 percentage point to 14 percent, one month after
introducing the rate, in an effort to curb inflation and bolster
the currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
