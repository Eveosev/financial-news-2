Ukrainian state aircraft maker ANTK
Antonov will produce two An-148 jets this year, Deputy Prime
Minister Borys Kolesnikov said.  Ukraine seeks to begin large-scale production of the jets,
Kolesnikov said in a statement e-mailed by the government press
service today.  “There is a demand for Ukrainian aircraft made by
Antonov,” Kolesnikov said in the statement.  Antonov can produce as many as 50 An-148 and An-158 jets by
2015 “with appropriate government support,” Dmytro Kiva,
Antonov’s chief designer, said in the same statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
