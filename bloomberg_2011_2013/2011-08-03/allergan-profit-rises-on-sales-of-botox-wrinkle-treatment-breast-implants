Allergan Inc., the maker of Botox,
said second-quarter profit rose 2.7 percent and raised its
earnings forecast on higher sales of the wrinkle smoother and
breast implants.  Net income increased to $246.6 million, or 79 cents a
share, from $240.1 million, or 78 cents, a year earlier, the
Irvine, California-based company said today in a statement.
Earnings, excluding some items, were 96 cents a share, topping
the average estimate of 95 cents from 21 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Sales rose to $1.42 billion from $1.25 billion a year
ago.  “Botox has really gone mainstream,” David Pyott,
Allergan’s chief executive officer, said today in a telephone
interview. “A big driver is new patients coming into the
marketplace.”   Revenue from Botox, Allergan’s top-selling product, was
$418 million, an increase of 16 percent from a year earlier and
beating the $397.6 million average estimate of seven analysts.
Demand for the product has overcome the effects of a weak
economy that normally hinder cosmetic sales, said  Gary Nachman ,
a senior analyst at Susquehanna International Group in New York.  “The aesthetic market has been very strong despite a
challenging economy,” Nachman said in a telephone interview
before Allergan released its earnings. “Your existing patient
base won’t go away. They may time the procedures a little
differently, but once they get used to looking younger, they
don’t want to change that.”  Allergan also sells breast implants, treatments for eye
diseases and the eyelash enhancer, Latisse.  Therapeutic Treatments  Botox, a purified form of the poison botulinum, received
U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval last October for use
in relieving migraine headaches. The company won backing of the
U.K.’s health-cost agency in July for use of Ozurdex as a
therapy for impaired vision caused by retinal vein occlusion.  Allergan raised its forecast for 2011 adjusted earnings per
share to $3.59 to $3.63 from an earlier target of $3.56 to
$3.62. Analysts had estimated $3.64. The company increased its
2011 revenue outlook to $5.22 billion to $5.37 billion from a
March forecast of $5.05 billion to $5.25 billion. Ramping up
sales of Botox as a therapeutic treatment may boost Botox net
sales up to $1.59 billion for 2011, the company said.  “We have some very good long-term growth prospects,” said
Pyott. “The power of innovation always beats general economic
conditions.”  The company’s shares rose $2.41, or 3.1 percent, to $79.79
at 4 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. They
have gained 16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
