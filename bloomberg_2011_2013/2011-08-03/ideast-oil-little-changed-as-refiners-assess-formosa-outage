Middle East crude oil for sale to
Asia was little changed as refiners assessed the impact of
Formosa Petrochemical Corp. shutting its refinery and awaited
official prices from  Saudi Arabia .  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., remained at
a discount of 8 cents a barrel to its official selling price,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. Qatar Marine was
at a discount of 8 cents a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.  Formosa shut its 540,000 barrel-a-day Mailiao,  Taiwan ,
plant after a fire on July 30 damaged power cables. The company
is asking other Asian refiners to take delivery of crude
supplies it can’t process, adding to expectations that the
market may suffer from an excess of supply this month.  Oman crude for October remained at a discount of about 40
cents a barrel to the price of Dubai, said two refinery
officials who participate in the market. There may be some
support for Middle East oil as the Formosa shutdown boosts
regional processing profits, spurring other plants to increase
output, said the officials.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai, a measure of profit, was up 47
cents today to $19.37 a barrel, compared with $18.03 a week ago,
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based broker, show.  Oman crude for immediate loading dropped for a second day
by 94 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $110.82 a barrel, Bloomberg data
showed. Dubai oil for delivery in October fell 0.9 percent to
$109.41. Murban decreased 0.8 percent to $113.71.  Oman futures for October delivery declined 49 cents to
$110.06 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5 p.m.
Singapore time, with 1,253 contracts traded. The settlement
price was $109.86 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The September Brent-Dubai EFS narrowed 21 cents to $5.74 a
barrel, according to PVM data. The exchange for swaps for
October dropped 19 cents to $5.22.  Saudi Prices  Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s biggest crude exporter,
may cut the premium for September exports of its Light oil grade
to  Asia  amid a slump in demand among refiners.  Arab Light may decline by 40 cents from its current premium
of $1.35 a barrel to the average of the benchmark Oman and Dubai
prices, according to the median of five responses in a Bloomberg
News survey of Asian refiners and analysts. Arab Extra Light may
fall about 20 cents a barrel, according to the survey. Arab
Heavy, the country’s densest grade, may drop 95 cents and Arab
Medium may slump 90 cents.  Saudi Arabian Oil, known as  Saudi Aramco , may lower rates
as the price of swaps of Middle East benchmark grade Dubai for
prompt delivery have slipped to a discount to later dated
forwards, a market situation known as contango. Any reduction
may be limited because of gains in refinery profits from
processing  fuel oil  into gasoil, known as the black-white spread.  To contact the reporter on this story:
