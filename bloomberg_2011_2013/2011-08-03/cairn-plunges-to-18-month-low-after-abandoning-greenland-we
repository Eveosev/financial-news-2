Cairn Energy Plc (CNE) , the Scottish  oil
company  focusing on exploration off Greenland, fell to a 17-
month low in London after abandoning a well.  Cairn slumped 5.1 percent to 334.80 pence, the lowest
closing price since Feb. 26, 2010.  The company plugged the LF7-1 exploration well, about 300
kilometers (186 miles) off Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, after it
failed to find oil, Edinburgh-based Cairn said in a statement.  Some of the seismic data collected proved “incorrect,”
Mike Watts, deputy chief executive officer, said on a conference
call. “We are dealing with separate basins.”  Cairn is one of several companies that were awarded
Greenland exploration licenses in the last decade, including
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , Chevron Corp. and Encana Corp. The Scottish
explorer had planned to drill as many as four wells off the
island at a cost of $600 million this year, it said in May.  “While clearly a disappointing result, we do not believe
the LF7-1 result has an impact on either of the three prospects
being drilled this year,” Phil Corbett, an analyst at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc, wrote in an e-mailed report.
“However, it’s hard to see how this result won’t impact
sentiment towards the remainder of the 2011 program.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
