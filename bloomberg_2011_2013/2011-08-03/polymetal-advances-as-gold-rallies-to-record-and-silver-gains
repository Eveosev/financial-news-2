OAO Polymetal advanced for a second
day as gold rallied to a record and silver rose, boosting the
stock of the Russian metals producer.  Its shares added as much as 1.7 percent to 593.4 rubles and
traded 0.9 percent stronger at 588.7 rubles by 11:52 a.m. in
Moscow.  Immediate-delivery gold surged to $1,671.82 an ounce,
surpassing yesterdayâ€™s high of $1,661.95 as escalating concern
that the global recovery may be losing momentum drove investors
to buy the metal to protect their wealth. Silver rose as much as
1.4 percent to $41.3850 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
