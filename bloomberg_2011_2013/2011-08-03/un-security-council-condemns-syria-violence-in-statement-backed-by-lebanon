The  United Nations Security Council 
condemned “widespread violations of human rights and the use of
force against civilians by the Syrian authorities.”  The UN decision-making body expresses “grave concern at the
deteriorating situation in Syria” and “profound regret at the
death of many hundreds of people,” India’s UN ambassador,
Hardeep Singh Puri, who holds the monthly rotating presidency,
said today in  New York .  A statement from the council president requires unanimous
consent and went through because Lebanon, which has a pro-Syria
government and is the only Arab country on the council, did not
object. Still, it falls short of the resolution sought by
European nations and the U.S. and opposed by Russia, which as
one of five permanent members has the power to veto.  The  Security Council  also asked Secretary-General Ban Ki-
moon for an update on the situation in Syria within seven days.
The UN body also calls on the Syrian authorities to allow aid
agencies, which have been prevented from entering the country,
“unhindered access” for humanitarian relief.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
