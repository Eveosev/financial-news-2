Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced,
reversing an earlier decline, on speculation overseas investors
are boosting holdings of the nation’s assets to benefit from
economic growth in  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy.  Gross domestic product likely increased more than 6.5
percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, Bank
Indonesia Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono said in a mobile-phone
message today. The economy grew 6.46 percent in the three months
through March, official data show. Overseas investors bought
$111 million more Indonesian shares than they sold in the first
two days of the week, taking net purchases this year to $2.8
billion, according to exchange data.  “Better economic growth is supporting capital inflows into
Indonesia,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank
Commonwealth in Jakarta. “Export growth is healthy and that
will boost the economy. Inflation is also manageable.”  The rupiah gained 0.1 percent to 8,479 per dollar as of
4:45 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency declined 0.1 percent earlier after data yesterday
showed  consumer spending  in the U.S. dropped in June for the
first time since September 2009.  Foreign ownership of  government bonds  climbed 27 percent
this year through Aug. 2 to 248.68 trillion rupiah ($29.3
billion), according to the debt management office.  Exports climbed 49.3 percent in June from a year earlier,
compared with a 44.9 percent increase the previous month,
official figures show. Consumer prices rose 4.6 percent in July
from a year earlier, from 5.5 percent in June, the  Central
Bureau of Statistics  said on Aug. 1. That’s the least in more
than a year.  Indonesia’s 10-year government bonds fell, snapping a six-
day rally. The yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021
climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.93
percent, according to closing prices from the Inter-Dealer
Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
