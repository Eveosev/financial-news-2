Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) , the world’s
largest video-game maker, posted second-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates and raised its full-year outlook, citing a
strong slate of online games and store titles.  Net income rose 53 percent to $335 million, or 29 cents a
share, from $219 million, or 17 cents, a year earlier,  Santa
Monica , California-based Activision said today in a statement.
Excluding items, profit of 10 cents exceeded the 5-cent average
of 18 analysts’ projections.  Profit this quarter for the maker of “World of Warcraft”
will be 1 cent a share on revenue of $530 million, excluding
items, reflecting a light release schedule. That’s below
analysts’ estimates of 8 cents on sales of $633.1 million. Two
of Activision’s largest retail titles, “Call of Duty: Modern
Warfare 3” and “Skylanders Spyro’s Adventure” will be
introduced in the fourth quarter.  Second-quarter sales, excluding changes in deferred
revenue, rose 2.3 percent to $699 million from $683 million a
year earlier. On that basis, analysts predicted revenue of
$597.4 million, the average of 19 estimates. Total revenue
gained 19 percent to $1.15 billion, the company said.  Activision increasingly relies on its “World of Warcraft”
and “Call of Duty” games to deliver recurring revenue from
digital subscriptions, Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick
said. More than 60 percent of sales were generated digitally,
the company said.  Subscription Revenue  “We have the benefit of consistent subscription revenue
and the kinds of products that people play every day,” Kotick
said in an interview.  Profit for the full year will be 77 cents a share,
excluding some items, on sales of $4.05 billion, Activision
said. Analysts project 75 cents and revenue of $4.04 billion on
that basis.  Activision rose 13 cents to $11.82 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have lost 5 percent
this year.  (Activision plans a conference call at 4:30 p.m. New York
