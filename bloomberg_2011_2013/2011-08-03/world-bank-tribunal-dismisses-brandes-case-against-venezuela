An  international arbitration panel 
dismissed a claim by Brandes Investment Partners against
 Venezuela  seeking damages for the forced sale of its stock in
the nationalization of the country’s phone company, state-oil
company Petroleos de Venezuela SA said today in a statement.  A panel at the World Bank’s International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes agreed with Venezuela that it
lacked jurisdiction to resolve the dispute, putting an end to a
case filed in 2008, according to the  statement .  “The decision once again shows that the country’s defense
in international proceedings is always grounded in solid legal
fundamentals,” PDVSA said.  Brandes Investment Partners, a  San Diego , California-based
investment advisory firm, argued that the forced sale of its
minority stake in Cia Anonima Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela
for $225.5 million resulted in a loss.  “Brandes is studying the award and can’t comment beyond
that at this time,” said Michael Nolan, a lawyer for Brandes in
the Washington office of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP.  Venezuela faces 17 pending arbitration cases at ICSID
including disputes with  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , ConocoPhillips and
Cemex SAB for nationalized assets.  The outcome of the proceeding and the decision on the award
rendered was Aug. 2, according to the ICSID website, without
providing additional details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
