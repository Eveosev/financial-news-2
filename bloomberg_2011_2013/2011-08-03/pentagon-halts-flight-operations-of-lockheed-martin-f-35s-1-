The Pentagon today suspended ground
and flight operations of  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s F-35 Joint
Strike Fighter following a  power failure  on a plane at Edwards
Air Force Base,  California .  The suspension grounds all 20 F-35’s that have flying
status, said Pentagon spokesman Joe DellaVedova in a written
statement.
The plane’s Integrated Power Package, a turbo machine that
provides power to start the engine, failed during an engine run
yesterday, forcing an engine shutdown, he said. No injuries to
the pilot or ground crew occurred.  The incident involved the AF-4 variant of the conventional-
takeoff-and-landing fighter jet.  The government and contractor engineering teams are
reviewing the data from the incident “to determine the root
cause of the failure,” said DellaVedova. A decision on lifting
the suspension will be made “once the facts are understood,”
he said.  “We are working hard to resolve the issue,” said Mike
Rein, a Lockheed Martin spokesman, who declined further comment.  The F-35, the Pentagon’s most expensive weapons program,
may be a target for budget cuts. The Defense Department will
have to find about $325 billion in cuts over the next 10 years
in the first phase of a $2.4 trillion deficit-reduction
agreement approved by Congress.  The Pentagon currently plans to spend $382 billion to buy
2,457 of the stealth jets in different versions for the Navy,
 Air Force  and Marine Corps.  Before leaving office in June, former Defense Secretary
 Robert Gates  said the Pentagon may need to reconsider how many
planes should be purchased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
