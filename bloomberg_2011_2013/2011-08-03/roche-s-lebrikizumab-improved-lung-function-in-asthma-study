Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s experimental
asthma drug lebrikizumab was linked to better lung function in a
study that showed the medicine may be useful as a targeted
treatment for asthma, researchers said in a study.  Patients with high levels of the protein periostin before
they started treatment showed greater improvement under the
Roche drug than did patients with low levels, researchers said
today in an article published in the New England Journal of
Medicine. Periostin can be measured with a blood test.  Sponsored by Basel, Switzerland-based Roche, the 219-
patient study is part of the second phase of clinical trials
required before a medicine may submitted for regulatory
approval.  To contact the reporter on this story: N
