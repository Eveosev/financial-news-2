Wheat fell for the first time this
week on renewed concern that rising Russian exports may curb
demand for supplies from the U.S., the world’s top shipper.  Russia  may export 20 million to 25 million metric tons of
grain this season, Interfax reported, citing Grain Union
President Arkady Zlochevsky. In the year that started July 1,
the country may ship as much as 5 million tons of wheat to
 Egypt , the biggest importer, he said, according to Interfax.  “There is so much global pressure on these grains,” Jon Marcus, the president of Lakefront Futures and Options LLC in
Chicago, said by telephone.  Wheat futures for December delivery dropped 9.75 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $7.49 a bushel at 10:12 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Before today, the most-active contract gained
9.4 percent in the past year.  Russia lifted an export ban on July 1 after the most-severe
drought in 50 years cut grain production in 2010. The nation was
the world’s second-largest wheat exporter during the 2009-2010
season, International Grains Council data show.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $13
billion in 2010, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
