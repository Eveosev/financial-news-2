Japan ’s parliament approved state
support of Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s compensation for victims
of the Fukushima nuclear disaster with a plan that asks
shareholders to shoulder some of the burden.  Japan’s upper house approved the bill in a 214-21 vote
after earlier backing in the lower chamber. The legislation
creates a state-backed entity to pay damages associated with the
world’s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986.  To contact the reporter on this story:
