A manager for Continental AG,
 Europe ’s second-biggest car-parts maker, is under police
investigation for alleged corruption, the  Frankfurt prosecutor’s
office  said.  The 60-year-old from Frankfurt, who served as a company
representative to eastern Europe,  Middle East  and Africa, is
accused of having accepted a total of at least 70,000 euros
($100,000) in bribes while negotiating and awarding contracts
for car replacement parts and equipment, Doris Moeller-Scheu, a
spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office, said by phone. He has
been in police custody since April, she said.  “The investigation will need at least several more months
because we need the assistance of police forces abroad,”
Moeller-Scheu said. “We have been communicating with
Switzerland, because we need to know about bank accounts,” as
well as with authorities in other countries such as Russia and
the  Czech Republic .  Eva Appold, a spokeswoman for Hanover, Germany-based
Continental, declined to comment on the allegations. German
prosecutors’ practice is not to provide full names of people
under investigation. Bild newspaper reported on the probe
earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
