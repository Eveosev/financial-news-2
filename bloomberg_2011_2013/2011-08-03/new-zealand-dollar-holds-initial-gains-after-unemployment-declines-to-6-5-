The New Zealand dollar held earlier
gains after a government report showed unemployment declined to
6.5 percent in the second quarter, matching economistsâ€™
estimates.  The currency bought 86.51 U.S. cents as of 10:48 a.m. in
Wellington, from 86.50 cents before the report and 86.35 cents
yesterday in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
