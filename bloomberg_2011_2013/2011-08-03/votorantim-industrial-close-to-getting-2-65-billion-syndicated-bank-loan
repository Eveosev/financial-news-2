Votorantim Industrial SA is close to
getting a $2.65 billion syndicated loan led by 10 banks from
 Europe , the U.S. and Japan in what would be the biggest credit
line obtained by a Brazilian company since April, according to
three people familiar with the deal.  The transaction is divided in two loans, a $1.15 billion
export prepayment facility and a standby revolving credit line
of $1.5 billion, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the loan agreement hasn’t been signed. Twenty banks are
participating in the deal.  Votorantim probably will pay 135 basis points to 150 basis
points over the Libor on the trade-related loan, which has
maturities of 7 to 8 years, the people said. The standby
facility is a 5-year loan at a cost of 85 basis points based on
the company’s current credit rating, the people said. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  The $2.65 billion credit line would be the biggest
syndicated loan for a Brazilian company since Vale SA said April
12 it obtained a $3 billion standby revolving facility at 65
basis points to 95 basis points.  Banks that led the loan include  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, Credit
