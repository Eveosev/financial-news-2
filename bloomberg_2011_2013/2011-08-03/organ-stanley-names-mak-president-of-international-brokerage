Morgan Stanley (MS) , owner of the world’s
largest retail brokerage, named Charlie Mak president of the
firm’s international wealth-management unit.  Mak, previously head of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney
unit in Asia, will report to  Greg Fleming , president of global
wealth management, according to an internal memo today from
Fleming. Jim Wiggins, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan
Stanley, confirmed the memo’s contents.  Fleming, 48, said in April that he asked Michael Armstrong,
who headed international wealth management, to focus on his role
as head of capital markets for the brokerage. The wealth-
management group had $10 billion in international client inflows
in 2010, compared with $12.9 billion from domestic customers.  James Jesse, chief operating officer of the capital markets
unit, will become COO of Morgan Stanley International Wealth
Management, according to the memo. Jesse will relocate from New
York to  Hong Kong , Fleming said in the memo.  Chris Van Aeken will lead the brokerage’s international-
banking and lending efforts, in addition to his role as chairman
of the firm’s Swiss private bank, according to the memo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
