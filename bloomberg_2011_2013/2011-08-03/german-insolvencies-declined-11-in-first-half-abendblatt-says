About 11 percent fewer German
companies declared bankruptcy in the first half than the same
period a year earlier,  Hamburger Abendblatt  reported, citing
Hamburg-based business information service Buergel.  Insolvencies declined to 15,302 cases, due in part to the
strength of the economy, the newspaper said in an e-mailed
preview of an article to appear in tomorrowâ€™s edition. The
biggest drop was in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, where the
number of insolvencies fell 19 percent to 1,519 cases, according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
