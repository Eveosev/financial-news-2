Slovak residential property prices
dropped 0.6 percent in the second quarter, a third consecutive
decline, as government austerity measures hurt demand and
employment has failed to recover, the central bank said.  The average price for residential property dropped to 1,256
euros ($1,798) per square meter (10.8 square feet) from 1,264
euros in the first quarter, the Bratislava, Slovakia-based
Narodna Banka Slovenska  said  today on its website. On an annual
basis, prices fell 2.9 percent.  The residential-property market in the eastern eurozone
member is struggling to recover after the 2009 recession as
employment has remained below the pre-crisis level and
government cuts in spending austerity measures have depressed
demand. The average price of residential property is 19 percent
down from the peak reached in the second quarter of 2008.  Prices varied from 618 euros a square meter in the Nitra
region of western Slovakia, to 1,682 euros in the capital,
Bratislava.  To contact the reporter on this story:
