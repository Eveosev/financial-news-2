The Swiss central bank said the
economic outlook has “deteriorated substantially” following
the franc’s surge to a record against the euro and the dollar.  The  Swiss National Bank  “is keeping a close watch on
developments on the foreign-exchange market and will take
further measures against the strength of the Swiss franc if
necessary,” it said in an e-mailed statement from Zurich today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
