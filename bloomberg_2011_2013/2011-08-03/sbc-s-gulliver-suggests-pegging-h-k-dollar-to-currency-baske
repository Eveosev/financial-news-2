Stuart Gulliver , chief executive
officer of  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , comments on  Hong Kong ’s exchange
rate system at a press conference yesterday.  On the Hong Kong dollar’s peg to U.S. currency:  “Overall the peg has created stability in Hong Kong, which
has enabled Hong Kong to prosper enormously.  “If you track the per capita GDP in Hong Kong over that
period, 1983 to now, the growth is phenomenal.  “So it’s hard to then look at the peg and say it’s been a
cause of economic sub-performance.  “So it’s hard to say that the currency is causing a
problem.”  On changing the peg:  “I don’t think there’s anything particularly acute at the
moment either that causes I think Hong Kong the need to review
that situation.”  “If Hong Kong was to review the  Hong Kong dollar  peg, it
clearly is the call of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
People’s Bank of  China  and the Hong Kong and China
governments.”  On alternatives for the Hong Kong dollar:  “My personal view would be that Hong Kong would be better
advised to move to some kind of managed float against a basket
of currencies that reflect the trading partners of Hong Kong
rather than choosing either a complete free float or to peg it
to another currency.  “Clearly until the RMB is convertible, there is no choice
to peg it to the RMB.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
