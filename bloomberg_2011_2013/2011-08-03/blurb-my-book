Please note that this offer is now close. We're in the final phases of editing  The Little Black Book of Innovation , and my editor had an interesting idea involving HBR blog readers.  First, a bit of background. My intent in writing the book was to make innovation literature more accessible. In a perhaps too flippant moment I even termed the book a gateway drug to innovation. My real hope is that the story-driven, action-oriented approach will help readers understand why innovation is so critical, while convincing them that they too can innovate so long as they learn to spot and seize the right opportunities.  Here's where you come in. The other day we were talking about the sorts of blurbs we ought to have on the book's back cover. We ran through the usual roster of thought leaders, innovation pundits, and corporate leaders, but if the book is intended for a broader audience, well, we ought to have someone from that audience share their thoughts too.   So, we're going to offer an advance copy of  The Little Black Book  to ten readers who agree to read the manuscript and, if they like it, provide a 35-word blurb that summarizes their view of the book's essence. We'll pick the best blurb and put it on the back jacket.  And thanks.
