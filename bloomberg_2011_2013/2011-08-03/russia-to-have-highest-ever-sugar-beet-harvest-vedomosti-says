Russia ’s sugar beet harvest may be
the highest-ever this year, Vedomosti  said , citing Maxim Basov,
the chief executive officer of sugar producer Ros Agro Plc.  The record harvest will enable the country to produce as
much as 4.5 million metric tons of sugar from the beet, the
newspaper said, citing Gleb Tikhomirov, the head of finance at
Sucden SA’s Russian unit.  As a result, Russia may halve purchases of raw-cane sugar
and produce less than 1 million tons of sugar from imported raw
cane in the 2011-12 season, compared with 2.3 million tons last
season, Vedomosti said, citing Andrei Bodin, the head of
Russia’s Sugar Producers Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
