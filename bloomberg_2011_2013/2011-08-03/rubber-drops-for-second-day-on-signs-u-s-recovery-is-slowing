Rubber advanced, reversing an earlier
decline, as heavy rains in  Thailand  increased concern that
supplies from the largest producer and exporter may be disrupted.  The January-delivery contract gained as much as 2 percent
to 395 yen per kilogram ($5,113 per metric ton) and settled at
391.1 yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange. The contract dropped
1.3 percent earlier.  Rains have spread across southern Thailand, disrupting
tapping, according to the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand.
The south accounts for 80 percent of Thai output.  “Concerns over supply in Thailand helped boost the rubber
price today after falling recently,” said Gu Jiong, an analyst
at commodity broker Yutaka Shoji in Tokyo. More rains will
further boost prices, he said.  Futures also gained after vehicle sales in the U.S. climbed
in July, increasing speculation that demand for rubber in the
third largest buyer may expand. Sales of cars and light trucks
rose 0.9 percent to 1,055,905 in July from the year-earlier
month, according to data from Ward’s Information Products on Aug.
2. For the year through July 31, sales rose 10.8 percent to
7,366,283, the data showed.  Car Sales  “U.S. car sales data were also supportive, improving
optimism that demand for rubber will continue to grow,” said
Chaiwat Muenmee, an analyst at Bangkok-based commodity broker DS
Futures Co.  The cash price of Thai rubber was unchanged at 145.55 baht
($4.89) a kilogram today, according to the research institute.  In  Shanghai , rubber for January delivery ended little
changed at 35,685 yuan ($5,544) per ton. Inventories monitored
by the Shanghai Futures Exchange totaled 18,797 tons as of July
28, 72 percent lower than at the end of 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
