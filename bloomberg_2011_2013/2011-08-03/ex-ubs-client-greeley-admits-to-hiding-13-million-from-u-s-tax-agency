A former  UBS AG (UBSN)  client pleaded guilty
to filing a false U.S. tax return that concealed more than
$13 million in two Swiss accounts, according to the Justice
Department.  Robert E. Greeley admitted in federal court today in  San
Francisco  that he filed a tax return in 2008 that failed to
disclose two UBS accounts set up in the names of Cayman Islands
entities.  U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer set Greeleyâ€™s sentencing
for Nov. 9. Greeley agreed to pay a civil penalty of
$6.8 million for failing to file a Report of Foreign Bank and
Financial Accounts form.  Greeley, a resident of San Francisco, was a client of
former UBS banker Renzo Gadola, who pleaded guilty Dec. 22 in
federal court in Miami.  Greeley is one of more than two dozen former UBS clients
accused of tax crimes since 2007. Zurich-based UBS avoided U.S.
prosecution in February 2009 by paying $780 million, turning
over the names of U.S. account holders and saying it helped
Americans hide assets from the  Internal Revenue Service .  The case is U.S. v. Greeley, 11-cr-374, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of  California  (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
