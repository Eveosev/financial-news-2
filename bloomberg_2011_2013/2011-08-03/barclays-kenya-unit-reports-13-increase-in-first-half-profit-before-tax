Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd. (BCBL) , the East
African nation’s second-largest lender by market value, posted a
2.2 percent drop in first-half profit on lower income from
loans.  Profit slid to 3.64 billion shillings ($40 million), the
company said in a statement released today in the capital,
 Nairobi . Net interest income fell to 7.39 billion shillings from
8.37 billion shillings, Chief Executive OfficerAdan Mohamed
told reporters.  “The performance is disappointing if you look at the
profits of their competitors,” said Renaldo D’souza, an analyst
at Nairobi-based Genghis Capital Ltd. “They removed ATM fees to
increase deposits. The strategy is not working because deposits
reduced.”  Customer deposits declined to 128.4 billion shillings from
130.6 billion shillings a year earlier. Barclays declared a
dividend of 0.20 shilling per share compared with 0.75 shilling
in the same period of 2010.  The lender’s shares retreated 0.3 percent to 15.40
shillings as of the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the lowest since
April 6.  Co-operative Bank of Kenya Ltd., the East African nation’s
fourth-largest lender, said first-half profit rose 41 percent as
it added customers and boosted lending.  Kenya Commercial Bank
Ltd. (KNCB) , the country’s largest lender by assets, said July 28
first-half profit jumped 41 percent as earnings from loans grew.  To contact the reporter on this story:
