Companies in the U.S. added 114,000
workers to payrolls in July, according to a private survey.  The increase followed a revised 145,000 gain the prior
month, according to data from ADP Employer Services. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for an
advance of 100,000.  A slowdown in hiring means consumers are unlikely to boost
the spending that fuels 70 percent of the economy, raising the
risk the recovery may stumble. A Labor Department report in two
days is projected to show businesses added 115,000 jobs in July,
according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “Payrolls hit a soft patch in the second quarter and
incoming evidence in July suggest payroll growth remains
subdued,” said  John Herrmann , senior-fixed income strategist at
State Street Global Markets in  Boston . “In the current quarter,
there has been no letup to risk” for the economy.  The median forecast was based on a survey of 39 economists.
Projections ranged from 20,000 to 150,000.  Stocks were little changed following the longest slump
since 2008 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The  S&P 500  fell
0.2 percent to 1,251.5 at 9:46 a.m. in  New York .  Treasury
securities  were also little changed.  Over the previous six reports, ADP’s initial figure was
closest to the Labor Department’s first estimate of private
payrolls in February, when it understated the gain in jobs by
5,000. The estimate was least accurate in January, when it
overestimated the increase in employment by 137,000.  June Miss  Last month, ADP’s figures showed a 157,000 gain in company
payrolls for June, while the Labor Department’s data showed a
57,000 increase.  Today’s ADP report showed a decrease of 7,000 workers in
goods-producing industries last month, which include
manufacturers and construction companies. Employment at
factories fell by 1,000.  Service providers added 121,000 workers in July, the
figures showed.  Companies employing more than 499 workers added 9,000 jobs.
Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to 499 employees, added 47,000
and small companies increased payrolls by 58,000, ADP said.  Another report today showed employers in July announced the
largest number of job cuts in 16 months. Planned firings climbed
59 percent from July 2010 to 66,414, according to figures
released today by Chicago-based Challenger, Gray & Christmas
Inc. Job-cut announcements were led by the pharmaceutical
industry, which included drugmaker Merck & Co.’s plans to
eliminate as many as 13,000 jobs.  Bernanke’s View  In his semi-annual testimony to Congress last month,
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the “economy
still needs a good deal of support.”  “The most recent data attest to the continuing weakness of
the labor market,” Bernanke said July 13. “It’s improving very
slowly in terms of jobs regained. Wages are very stagnant and
that’s affecting  consumer spending  and  consumer confidence .
There is also ongoing uncertainty about the durability of the
recovery.”  Job cuts have accelerated as the economy slowed.  Cisco
Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the largest networking-equipment maker, plans to
eliminate about 6,500 jobs, or 9 percent of its full-time global
workforce, to help trim $1 billion in annual costs and bolster
profits.  The job cuts will come from across the company and aren’t
concentrated in a single unit, said Karen Tillman, a company
spokeswoman, in an interview July 18.  Factory Slowdown  Manufacturing, a stalwart of the expansion, grew last month
at the slowest pace in two years, a sign the industry that
helped drive the expansion is losing steam, figures from the
 Institute for Supply Management  showed this week. ISM’s
employment index posted the biggest decrease since October 2008.  The Labor Department’s report may show overall payrolls
rose by 85,000 in July, restrained by cutbacks at state and
local governments, the Bloomberg survey showed.  The Labor Department figures will also show the jobless
rate held at 9.2 percent last month, according to the Bloomberg
survey median.  The ADP report is based on data from about 340,000
companies with more than 21 million workers on payrolls.
