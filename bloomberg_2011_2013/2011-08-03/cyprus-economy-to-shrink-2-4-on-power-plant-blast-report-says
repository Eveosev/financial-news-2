Cyprus’s economy will shrink 2.4
percent on an annual basis and unemployment will rise 1 percent
as a result of the July 11 blast that knocked out more than half
of its power production capacity, the  University of Cyprus  said.  “Directly, retail trade and manufacturing have been
affected most, while there are pessimistic expectations in other
sectors of the economy,” the university said in a  report  on its
website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
