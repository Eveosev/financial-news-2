Ethanol production in the U.S. rose
0.5 percent to 878,000 barrels a day last week, according to an
Energy Department report.  Stockpiles were little changed at 18.9 million barrels.
Thatâ€™s enough supply for 21.5 days, according to the Energy
Department.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
increased 0.5 percent to 5.22 million barrels a day. Refiners
receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended
into the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery declined 1.2 cents to
$2.83 a gallon at 10:40 a.m. New York time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Futures have gained 19 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
