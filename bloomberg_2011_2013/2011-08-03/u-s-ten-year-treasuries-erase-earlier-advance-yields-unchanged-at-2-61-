U.S. 10-year Treasuries erased gains,
leaving yields on the 2021 securities unchanged from yesterdayâ€™s
close at 2.61 percent as of 9:34 a.m. in  London .  Benchmark Treasury yields earlier sank to as low as 2.57
percent, the least since November, as signs of slowing global
economic growth stoked demand for the perceived safety of  U.S.
government debt .  Two-year notes also reversed gains, pushing up yields by
one basis point to 0.33 percent. Yields on the 2013 securities
had earlier slid to a record low 0.3081 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
