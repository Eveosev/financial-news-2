Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the world’s largest
drugmaker, has agreed to buy closely held Alacer Corp., which
makes dietary supplements including the vitamin C product
Emergen-C.  Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed by New York-based
Pfizer, which plans to divest its nutritional and animal health
units. Alacer, based in  Foothill Ranch , California, makes about
500 million packets of the vitamin powder each year, Pfizer said
today in a statement announcing the deal. A 30-pack of Emergen-C
sells for $9.99 on the drugstore  Walgreen Co. (WAG) ’s website.  “Emergen-C products add to and greatly complement our
market-leading dietary supplement portfolio,” Paul Sturman,
president of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, said in the statement.  The brand will become part of Pfizer’s consumer health-care
business, which was acquired with the 2009 purchase of Wyeth.
The unit made up 4.5 percent of Pfizer’s 2011 revenue in 2011.
Pfizer’s dietary supplements line has more than $1 billion in
sales, and the largest product is the Centrum brand
multivitamin.  Shares of Pfizer rose less than 1 percent to $21.26 at the
close in  New York .  In 2011, Pfizer bought Danish vitamins company Ferrosan
from Altor Equity Partners AB, a private equity fund, for an
undisclosed amount.  To contact the reporter on this story:
