Chinese automaker shares rose, led
by  Dongfeng Automobile Co. (600006)  and  FAW Car Co. (000800) , after the government
excluded foreign brands from a preliminary list for official-
vehicle purchases.  Dongfeng Automobile jumped 10 percent, the first time it
climbed by the daily limit since November 2009, and traded at
3.81 yuan as of 9:46 a.m. in  Shanghai . FAW gained 4.9 percent to
10.78 yuan in Shenzhen.  Great Wall Motor Co. (2333)  rose 3.6 percent to
14.51 yuan, set for the highest close since its Shanghai share
sale in September.  All 412 models approved for purchase by state agencies this
year will be limited to Chinese brands, according to the
Ministry of Industry and  Information Technology . The move will
help local brands gain in the government fleet’s 80 billion yuan
($12.7 billion) market at the expense of foreign carmakers such
as  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
 China International Capital Corp (CICCZ) . said in a report today.  “This signals strong government determination to cultivate
China’s own auto industry,” analysts led by Zheng Dong wrote in
the CICC report. “Government support of local brands is greater
than expected, even though rumors about the policy were many in
the past several months.”  Overseas brands accounted for about 80 percent of the
official pool, according to Guotai Junan Securities Co. In the
broader market, they account for 7 of every 10 cars sold in the
country, which overtook the U.S. in 2009 to become the world’s
largest vehicle market, according to data from  China Association
of Automobile Manufacturers .  Bigger Than Japan  China  spent 80 billion yuan on government vehicle purchases
in 2010, accounting for 4.5 percent of total passenger-vehicle
sales assuming average selling price of 160,000 yuan, according
to CICC estimates.  The Ministry of Supervision estimates the state operated a
fleet of at least 5.2 million vehicles as of November 2007 --
more than the total number of cars sold in  Japan  last year.  Vehicles used for official purposes such as tax collection
must have an engine size no bigger than 1.8 liters and costing
at most 180,000 yuan, according to the government rules.
Manufacturers must have spent no less than 3 percent of their
core revenue on research and development in the past two years
to qualify for the government list, the rules say.  “Most countries use official cars as a way to showcase the
domestic  auto industry , so we see this as a natural progression
of the development of China’s automotive industry,”  Janet Lewis , Lin Zhixuan and Aaron Qi, analysts at Macquarie Group
Ltd., wrote in a report today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
