Emerging-market stocks fell from a
six-month high on concern higher energy costs will hurt economic
growth and erode earnings at airlines and automakers.  Korean Air Lines Co. (003490) , South Korea’s biggest carrier,
dropped 5.3 percent even as crude-oil futures fell from a nine-
month high.  Thai Airways  International Pcl sank 3.5 percent
after posting its largest annual loss in three years.  Hyundai
Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea’s No. 1 automaker, dropped to a two-month
low and India’s  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  slid 2.4 percent.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  fell 0.7 percent to
1,060.39 as of 2:51 p.m. in Singapore, after reaching a six-
month high on Feb. 24. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index slid
2 percent and South Korea’s Kospi Index and the BSE India
Sensitive Index each lost at least 1.4 percent.  China’s Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose to a three month high, on expectations the
government will further loosen monetary policies to spur growth.  “High oil prices for a certain period will derail the
global economic recovery, which remain very fragile,” Jintana Mekintharanggur, who helps overseas about $164 million as the
director of equities investment at Manulife Asset Management Co.
in Bangkok, said by phone today. “Higher energy costs will also
accelerate inflation, hindering the policy makers’ ability to
cut  interest rate  further to boost growth.”  Higher oil prices may push inflation in  South Korea , the
world’s fifth-largest oil importer, above the government’s
target and have a “far-reaching” effect on the economy,
Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said in an interview in Mexico
City over the weekend. The world economy is “not out of the
danger zone” amid fragile financial systems, high public and
private debt and rising oil prices, International Monetary Fund
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said in a statement after
the Group of 20 meeting this weekend.  Oil Prices  Crude oil for April delivery slid as much as 0.5 percent
today. Oil gained 1.8 percent to $109.77 a barrel in  New York  on
Feb. 24, advancing for a seventh day, the longest stretch since
January 2010.  MSCI’s emerging-market gauge has gained 16 percent this
year, beating the 9.9 percent gain for the MSCI World Index of
developed-market shares. The  developing-nation index  trades at
10.6 times estimated earnings, below the 12.9 multiple for the
MSCI World.  Gauges of consumer-related companies and industrial stocks
dropped 1.2 percent each, the most among the 10  industry groups 
in MSCI’s emerging-markets index. Tata  fell  2.4 percent, the
most since Feb. 16. Hyundai Motor lost 3 percent, set for the
lowest close since Dec. 20.  Aboitiz Tumbles  Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc. (AEV) , which has investments in
power, food and banking, was the biggest contributor to the drop
in the emerging-markets index of industrial companies. Aboitiz
Equity tumbled 12 percent in Manila trading, the most in almost
11 years, after the company denied it’s in talks to merge its
Union Bank of the Philippines venture with either Bank of the
Philippine Islands or Rizal Commercial Banking Corp.  Thai Airways, the nation’s largest carrier, dropped 3.5
percent in Bangkok trading. The company reported a loss of 10.2
billion baht in 2011, compared with net income of 14.7 billion
baht in 2010, after costs related to foreign-currency debt and
fuel surged, it said in a filing.  Korean Air , South Korea’s largest carrier,  slumped  5.3
percent in Seoul trading.  China Airlines Ltd. (2601) , Taiwan’s largest
carrier, slipped 1.1 percent and  Eva Airways Corp. (2618)  declined 2
percent in Taipei.  China, Vietnam Gain  China’s Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.1 percent,
heading for the highest close since Nov. 16.  China Vanke Co. (000002) 
gained among developers after a newspaper reported suggestions
from a former central bank official to help boost lending.
Vanke, the nation’s biggest listed property developer, rose 1.5
percent.  Gemdale Corp. (6000383)  gained 2.7 percent.  Vietnam’s benchmark VN Index rose 1.2 percent to 428.41 at
the close, the highest level since Sep. 28 on speculation
slowing inflation will prompt central bank to cut interest
rates.  Consumer prices climbed 16.44 percent in February from a
year earlier, the General Statistics Office said Feb. 24. That
compared with a 17.27 percent pace reported earlier for last
month. Prices rose 1.37 percent this month from January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
