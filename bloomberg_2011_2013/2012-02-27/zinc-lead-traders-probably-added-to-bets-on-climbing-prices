Zinc and lead traders probably added
to wagers on rising prices as the number of outstanding
contracts increased at the same time that prices advanced.  Open interest in London Metal Exchange zinc futures gained
by 12,193 contracts to 417,146 lots in the week ended Feb. 23,
according to exchange figures. Each contract represents 25
metric tons of the metal used to rustproof steel. Zinc for
three-month delivery, the benchmark, climbed 3.5 percent during
the period.  Open interest in LME lead futures advanced by 4,391
contracts to 165,210 lots, each equaling 25 tons of the metal
used in batteries and radiation shielding. Lead for three-month
delivery rose 7.4 percent during the week, leading gains among
the six main industrial metals traded on the LME.  A combination of rising open interest and higher prices
suggests new long positions, or bets on an advance, according to
Macquarie Group Ltd.  Following are changes to market open interest for both LME
members and their clients for the exchangeâ€™s six main
industrial-metals futures. The figures were compiled by the LME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
