New York Giants receiver  Mario Manningham  is “75 percent” certain he will be playing for a
different National Football League team next season, the
Vindicator, a Youngstown, Ohio, newspaper, reported this
weekend.  Manningham, who caught a 38-yard pass on the Giants’ final
scoring drive in their Super Bowl win over the  New England
Patriots , said it might be in his best interest to sign with a
new team once free agency begins on March 13, according to the
newspaper.  “I’m ready for whatever,” Manningham told the newspaper.
“If it ain’t there, it’s somewhere else.”  Manningham had 39 receptions for 523 yards and four
touchdowns last season, his fourth since being selected by the
Giants in the third round of the 2008  NFL Draft . He was third on
the team in catches and touchdown receptions behind Hakeem Nicks
and  Victor Cruz .  “I don’t think it’s fair to frame the odds on that,”
Giants general manager Jerry Reese told reporters this weekend
at the NFL Combine, according to ESPN. “He is a good football
player and we’re glad he’s been a Giant for us and his
contributions are outstanding for us.”  Manningham, 25, said he had an idea where he would end up,
but declined to say where it was, according to the newspaper.
ESPN has reported that he may join former Giants quarterback
coach Mike Sullivan who is now offensive coordinator of the
 Tampa Bay Buccaneers .  -- Editor: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
