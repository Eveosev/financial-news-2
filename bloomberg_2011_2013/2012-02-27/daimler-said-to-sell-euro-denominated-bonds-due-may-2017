Daimler AG (DAI)  plans to sell senior
unsecured bonds in euros due May 2017, according to a banker
with knowledge of the transaction.  The notes may be priced to yield 60 to 65 basis points more
than the benchmark mid-swap rate, the banker said. BNP Paribas
SA, Commerzbank AG and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  are managing the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
