Golar LNG Ltd. (GOL) , the owner of
liquefied natural gas carriers led by billionaire  John Fredriksen , will buy two further vessels for more than $400
million as demand for the fuel strengthens.  The ships will arrive in 2014’s second quarter and early
2015, Hamilton, Bermuda-based Golar said in a statement today.
The order from  Samsung Heavy Industries Co. (010140)  includes an option
to buy two more. The company said Feb. 14 it would buy two of
the carriers from Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries Co. for more
than $400 million for delivery in the second half of 2014.  Golar now has 13 vessels on order and options to build four
more, according to the statement. Demand for LNG carriers will
expand 12 percent this year, more than the fleet’s growth of 2.5
percent, RS Platou Markets AS said in a report Feb. 7. Rates for
the ships will rise to $140,000 a day, the Oslo-based investment
bank estimates.  “Golar has the biggest newbuild program in the industry, a
sign we take as the company’s strong view on the market,” Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst at Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo,
said in an e-mailed note today. “Given that the vessels are
delivered through 2013-15, we think Golar is seeing not only
near-term strength, but a long-term change in the LNG market.”  Golar rose 0.8 percent to 251.5 kroner by the 5:30 p.m. in
Oslo trading today, giving the company a market value of 20.1
billion kroner ($3.6 billion). The shares more than doubled in
the past year. The company’s  net income  will jump to $193.7
million this year from $46.7 million in 2011, according to the
median of 12 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
