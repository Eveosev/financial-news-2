The book-selling, professional marketing and all-purpose political  organization known as "Newt 2012" is being pestered by the Federal  Election Commission. Newt 2012, a multimillion-dollar enterprise that has also fielded a  candidate,  Newt Gingrich , for the Republican presidential nomination, is  not about to be bogged down by government bureaucrats. Rather than  file  the campaign finance documents required of every presidential campaign, Newt 2012 has basically told the FEC to stuff it. As the Washington Times  reported  last week, the Gingrich campaign has a tendency to generalize when  filing finance disclosure statements, citing, for example, more  than $88,000 in reimbursements to Newt Gingrich in January for ... "travel." The expense was part of what the Times  characterized as "$220,000 in mystery money" paid to top Gingrich staff.  As the Los Angeles Times  noted ,  the Gingrich-allied super-PAC Winning Our Future has also been paying  very impressive fees to the long-time Gingrich aides who run the  super-PAC. The exchange of letters between the FEC and Gingrich campaign treasurer Lisa Lisker offers a compelling exhibit of both the FEC's  impotence  and the contempt with which political professionals regard it. On Sept. 22, 2011, the commission sent Lisker a  letter  pointing out the campaign's failure to follow the law and telling her  -- in bold text -- that a failure to respond to the letter by Oct. 27 "could result in an audit or enforcement action." You can gauge the level of terror this threat instilled by the date of Lisker's casual, contemptuous, two-paragraph  reply :  Nov. 29. Lisker replied that the  Gingrich campaign had concluded that "no further itemization is  required" for the expenses and so none was forthcoming. Having informed  the commission that she could not care less about its preoccupation with  campaign finance details, Lisker concluded, "Thank you for bringing these items to our attention." The FEC sent Lisker another  letter  on Feb. 17 requesting "information essential to full public disclosure of your federal election campaign finances." Any bets on when the Gingrich campaign will reply? How  about wagers on when the FEC might get around to an "enforcement action"?
