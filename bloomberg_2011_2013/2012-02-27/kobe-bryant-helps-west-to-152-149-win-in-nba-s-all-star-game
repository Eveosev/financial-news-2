Kobe Bryant  surpassed Michael Jordan
as the leading scorer in National Basketball Association All-
Star Game history while helping the Western Conference hold on
for a 152-149 victory over the East.  The Los Angeles Lakers’ guard, making his 13th All-Star
appearance, scored 27 points last night at Amway Center in
Orlando, Florida. He went past Jordan’s mark of 262 All-Star
points with a breakaway dunk during the third quarter and pushed
his career total to 271.  Kevin Durant  of the Oklahoma City Thunder scored a team-
high 36 points for the West, which withstood the East’s fourth-
quarter rally led by  LeBron James , who also scored 36 points.  “This is a dream come true,” Durant said after receiving
the Most Valuable Player trophy. “These guys behind me were
trying to feed me the ball and I was having a lot of fun. I’m
glad I’m taking this back to Oklahoma City.”  The East trailed by as much as 21 points before pulling
within one in the closing seconds with a 31-12 scoring run.  Deron Williams of the  New Jersey Nets  then missed a 3-
pointer with less than 10 seconds left and the Miami Heat’s
James threw a pass away with 1.9 seconds remaining as the West
pulled out the win.  “It’s nerve wracking with all these great players who can
make so many big shots,” said Durant, who hit 14 of 25 shots.
“I’m glad we came out on top.”  Members of the winning team receive $35,000, while those on
the losing squad get $15,000 each.  West’s Quick Start   Bryant opened the game with a 17-foot jump shot and Durant
followed with a 3-pointer as the Western Conference opened an
early 7-0 lead and never trailed. The West extended its
advantage to 90-69 early in the third quarter and still led by
20 points with nine minutes remaining.  James, who tied an All-Star Game record with six 3-
pointers, had eight points in the fourth quarter as the East
fought back before falling short.  Durant’s  Oklahoma City  teammate,  Russell Westbrook ,
finished with 21 points for the West while  Blake Griffin  of the
 Los Angeles Clippers  had 22. Kevin Love of the Minnesota
Timberwolves added 17 points and Clippers point guard Chris Paul
had a team-leading 12 assists.  Dwyane Wade of the Heat finished with 24 points, 10
rebounds and 10 assists for the East, becoming the third player
in All-Star history to record a triple-double after James and
Jordan.  Williams added 20 points and Carmelo Anthony of the  New
York Knicks  had 19 and nine rebounds. Dwight Howard of the
 Orlando Magic , who has been the subject of trade talks, totaled
nine points and 10 rebounds in his home arena.  The Eastern Conference leads the all-time series 36-25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
