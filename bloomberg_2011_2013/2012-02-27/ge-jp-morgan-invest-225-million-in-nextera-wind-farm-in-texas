General Electric Co. (GE)  and JP Morgan
Chase & Co. jointly purchased a minority stake in the Capricorn
Ridge wind farm in Texas for $225 million from  NextEra Energy
Inc. (NEE)   GE, whose equipment generates more than a quarter of the
world’s power, has invested in 2,143 megawatts of wind farms in
Texas, about 20 percent of the state’s total installed wind
capacity, the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company said today in
a statement.  The 662.5-megawatt Capricorn Ridge wind farm, which began
operating in 2007, uses turbines produced by both GE and  Siemens
AG (SIE)  and can produce enough power for about 220,000 homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
