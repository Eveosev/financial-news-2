Saudi Arabia  plans to invest $107
billion over the next five years to boost oil, natural-gas, and
refining production capacity,  al-Eqtisadiah  newspaper said,
citing Majid al-Moneef, an adviser to the oil minister.  Saudi Arabia, the worldâ€™s largest crude exporter, has
invested $63 billion in the past five years on oil and gas
projects, the newspaper said, citing al-Moneef, who is also the
governor for Saudi Arabia at the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.  The Kingdom has a policy of keeping between 1.5 million and
2 million barrels a day of oil as spare capacity, al-Eqtisadiah
quoted al-Moneef as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
