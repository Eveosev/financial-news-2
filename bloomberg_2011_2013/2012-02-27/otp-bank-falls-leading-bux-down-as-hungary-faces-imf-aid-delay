OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, fell as European stocks declined and talks on a bailout
for the country from the European Union and  International
Monetary Fund  faced delays.  The shares dropped 1.1 percent to 3,997 forint by the close
in Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock  index  slipped 1.1 percent
to 19,168.46 and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated 0.6
percent.  Hungary didn’t receive any indication of dates in meetings
preparing bailout negotiations, central bank President Andras
Simor said in an interview with news website Origo published
late yesterday. A European Commission plan to cut Hungary’s
development subsidies is “credit negative” and “complicates”
talks on an International Monetary Fund-led loan, Moody’s
Investors Service said in an e-mailed report today.  “The negotiations and implementation of the programme in
our view will prove challenging,” Michael Harris, a London-
based equity strategist at Bank of America Corp., and colleagues
wrote in a research report today. The bank named Poland as its
new top equities pick in the region instead of  Hungary ,
according to the report, adding that OTP is a “market proxy”
for Hungary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
