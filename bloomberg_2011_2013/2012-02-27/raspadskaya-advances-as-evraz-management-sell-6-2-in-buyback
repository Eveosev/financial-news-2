OAO Raspadskaya (RASP)  jumped to the
highest in a week after a venture between its management and
 Evraz Plc (EVR) , the steelmaker part-owned by billionaires  Roman
Abramovich  and Alexander Abramov, agreed to sell 6.2 percent in
the Russian coal producer’s buyback.  Corber Enterprises Ltd., which controls about 80 percent of
Raspadskaya, signed an agreement to sell back 48.4 million
shares for 7.25 billion rubles ($249 million), the coal producer
said today in a regulatory filing.  Raspadskaya shares rose as much as 2 percent to 118.85
rubles, the highest intraday level in a week, after the coal
producer gave the update on its buyback, and traded up 0.8
percent at 117.38 rubles by 2:55 p.m. in Moscow.  Raspadskaya received legitimate bids for 129 percent of its
outstanding stock in a buyback program that ended Jan. 31. The
coal producer, which had offered to repurchase about 10 percent
of its stock at 150 rubles a share, agreed to buy back 7.74
percent of the amount each investor tendered, according to a
statement on Feb. 6.  Corber is selling about 1 percentage point less than was
expected,  George Buzhenitsa , a Deutsche Bank AG analyst in
Moscow, said by phone today. That may be because of the
overbidding, he said.  Tatiana Drachuk, a Evraz spokeswoman, declined to comment,
while Alexander Andreyev, Raspadskaya’s spokesman, wasn’t
available when called by Bloomberg on his mobile phone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
