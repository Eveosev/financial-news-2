Serbia ’s central bank sold 80
million euros ($107 million) on the market today to reverse
declines in the dinar after the currency dropped to an all-time
low of 112 to the euro.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said in a statement
on its website that it “acted to smooth excessive daily
swings” triggered by concerns that the government’s spending
policies are not in line with pledges initially made to the
 International Monetary Fund  under a $1.3 billion precautionary
loan program.  The dinar closed at 110.0108 at 4:30 p.m. in Belgrade at
the end of the trading session, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank set the official  exchange rate  for
Feb. 28 at 110.3562 to the euro.  With today’s intervention, the National Bank of Serbia sold
a total of 188.5 million euros since the start of February to
curb dinar declines. It acted a day before the government is due
to sell 20 billion dinars in three-year Treasury bonds, with a
10 percent coupon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
