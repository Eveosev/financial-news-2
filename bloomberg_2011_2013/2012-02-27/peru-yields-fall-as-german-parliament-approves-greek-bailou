Peruvian dollar bonds rose, pushing
down yields the most in two weeks, as German lawmakers approved
a second euro-region bailout for  Greece , fueling demand for
higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.74 percent at 12:43 p.m. in Lima. That’s
the steepest decline since Feb. 13. The bond’s price rose 0.59
cent to 126.33 cents per dollar.  Germany’s lower house of parliament approved the rescue
package worth 130 billion euros ($174 billion) as European
leaders seek to stave off a collapse of the  Greek economy .
Germany is the biggest contributor to euro-area aid.  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  said earlier that pushing Greece out of the euro
would risk “incalculable” damage to the European Union and the
global economy as she defied a backlash against the bailout.  “There is some negative feeling but the risk-on trade will
remain in place,” said Alberto Bernal, head of fixed-income
research at Bulltick Capital Markets in Miami. “We’re in a much
better position than we were before.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose one basis point to 5.52
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
security’s price fell 0.06 centimo to 115.45 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
