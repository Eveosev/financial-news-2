About 52 percent of the winter-wheat
crop in  Kansas , the biggest grower, was in good or excellent
condition as of yesterday, up from 49 percent a month  earlier ,
as fields received precipitation, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said.  In Oklahoma, 67 percent of the winter wheat  crop  got the
top ratings, up from 54 percent at the end of  January , the
USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service said today on
its website. Sixty-five percent of Nebraska’s crop was good or
excellent, unchanged from a month earlier. In  Texas , 31 percent
of the winter wheat received the top ratings, deteriorating from
32 percent a week  earlier , the USDA said.  Areas of Nebraska, central Kansas and northern Oklahoma had
triple the normal amount of precipitation in the past 30 days,
while conditions were drier in southern Oklahoma and northern
parts of Texas, National Weather Service data show.  Drought 
conditions persisted in most of  Texas , western Oklahoma and
southern Kansas as of Feb. 21, after months of below-normal
rain, according to the University of Nebraska at Lincoln.  “There has been some moisture around,”  Larry Glenn , an
analyst at Frontier Ag in Quinter, Kansas, said in a telephone
interview today before the USDA’s reports. “For wheat
producers, at least there’s a little bit of hope now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
