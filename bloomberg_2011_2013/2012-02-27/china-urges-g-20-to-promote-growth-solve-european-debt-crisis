China  urged the world’s biggest
economies to work together to promote growth, resolve the
European debt crisis and help lower  oil prices .  China told officials of the Group of 20 nations meeting in
Mexico City over the weekend that they “should continue to
strengthen cooperation,” the Beijing-based Finance Ministry
said in a  statement  on its website today. “The G-20 should make
the promotion of financial market stability and economic
recovery the priority.”  Finance ministers and central bankers from the G-20 said
yesterday that any decision on outside help for Europe hinges on
the euro area delivering more financial firepower within two
months. A European review of its financial firewall against the
crisis next month is “essential” before any consideration to
“mobilize resources” for the  International Monetary Fund , the
G-20 said in a statement yesterday after the gathering.  China will do its part to boost resources for the IMF,  Zhou Xiaochuan , Governor of the People’s Bank of China, told
reporters in Mexico City at the end of the meeting.  Zhou said “the communiqué says it’s positive to push
forward and deliver the action plan,” including increasing the
IMF’s resources. “China as an important member of the G-20
group will certainly do our job in this regard,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
