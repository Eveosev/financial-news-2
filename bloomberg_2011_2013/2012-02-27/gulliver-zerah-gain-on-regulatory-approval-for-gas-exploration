Gulliver Energy Ltd. (GLVR)  rose the most
in more than than three months after the Israeli oil and gas
explorer and its partners received regulatory approval to begin
exploring for natural gas at the Gulliver/203 site.  The  shares  rallied 7.2 percent, the most since Nov. 10, to
0.337 shekel at 11:40 a.m. in Tel Aviv, valuing the Ramat Gan-
based company at 68 million shekels ($18 million).  Zerah Oil & Gas Explorations LP (ZRAHL) , a partner at the site,
advanced 4.6 percent, the most since Nov. 7, to 0.046 shekel.  The approval is conditional on the presentation of a work
plan, Gulliver said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
