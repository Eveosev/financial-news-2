Prudential Plc (PRU) , the U.K.’s biggest
insurer by market value, said it may move its headquarters from
Britain, where it was founded 164 years ago, if new European
regulations hamper the business.  “Prudential regularly reviews its range of options to
maximize the strategic flexibility of the group,” the London-
based insurer said in statement today. “This includes
consideration of optimizing the group’s domicile, including as a
possible response to an adverse outcome on Solvency II.”  Solvency II, a set of rules the European Union plans to
introduce in 2013, is designed to align insurers’ capital
reserves with the risks they take. Prudential Chief Executive
Officer  Tidjane Thiam  has warned the new regulations may lead to
“unintended consequences.”  The insurer may be concerned it will be forced to hold
additional capital if the European rules clash with solvency
regulations in the U.S., where the company gets more than a
third of its revenue, according to Marcus Barnard, a London-
based analyst at Oriel Securities Ltd.  The  stock  dropped 1.2 percent to 713.5 pence at 10 a.m. in
London trading, valuing the firm at about 18.2 billion pounds
($28.9 billion).  “There continues to be uncertainty in relation to the
implementation of Solvency II and implications for the group’s
businesses,” Prudential said in the statement. “Clarity on
this issue is not expected in the near term.”  ‘Serious and Viable’  Prudential shares are already listed in  Hong Kong , and the
city is the insurer’s second-biggest Asian market by revenue.
 Donald Tsang , Hong Kong’s chief executive, said in September he
would “absolutely” welcome U.K. financial firms  HSBC Holdings
Plc (HSBA)  and  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  if they decided to move their
headquarters to the Chinese financial hub.  Hong Kong is a “serious and viable option” for
Prudential, according to Eamonn Flanagan, a Liverpool-based
analyst at Shore Capital Group Ltd.  The firm has a strategic goal to use capital generated in
its U.K. business to build its Asian division, which accounts
for about 40 percent of its sales.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
