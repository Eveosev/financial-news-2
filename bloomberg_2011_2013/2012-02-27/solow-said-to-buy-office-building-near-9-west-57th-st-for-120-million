Sheldon Solow, a New York developer,
agreed to pay about $120 million for an office building across
the street from his 9 West 57th St. tower, a person with
knowledge the deal said.  The price for the 11-story property at 12 West 57th St.
comes to $1,428 a square foot, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the negotiations are private.  Solow is buying the 84,000-square-foot (7,800-square-meter)
property in part to protect the value of 9 West, one of the
cityâ€™s most costly skyscrapers, the person said. By controlling
the building across the street, he will prevent another
developer from constructing a tower that might block the
southern views from 9 West, the person said.  In December, Solow refinanced 9 West for $625 million. The
50-story tower offers unobstructed views of Central Park, one
block to the north. The lender, Deutsche Bank AG, securitized
the loan earlier this month, a person with knowledge of that
offering said at the time.  Steve Solomon, a spokesman for Solow, and George Shea, a
spokesman for  Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) , the broker for seller Trigon
Equities, declined to comment.  The retail tenants at 12 West 57th St. are Metropolitan
Antiques and Mackenzie-Childs Ltd., a furniture merchant. Both
are on leases that expire next year, the person with knowledge
of the purchase said. The building was home to Henri Bendel, a
luxury retailer, before it moved to the then-new 712 Fifth Ave.
tower in the late 1990s.  The deal was reported earlier today by the New York Post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
