Telstra Corp (TLS) ,  Australia ’s biggest
phone company, gained antitrust approval to split from its
fixed-line assets, clearing the way for an A$11 billion ($12
billion) compensation package from the government.  The regulator accepted the so-called structural separation
plan after Telstra gave rivals improved access and prices to its
copper-wire network, the Australian Competition & Consumer
Commission said in a regulatory statement today.  Telstra shareholders last year agreed to give up control of
the Melbourne-based company’s copper wires, the only existing
national network, to the government-backed NBN Co., which is
building a fiber platform. Telstra will set prices for rivals
based on the regulator’s proposal during the transition to the
new National Broadband Network.  “The ACCC’s acceptance of Telstra’s undertaking marks a
significant milestone in the structural reform of the
telecommunications sector,” Chairman Rod Sims said in the
statement.  Telstra’s copper network is a legacy of its former status
as a state-owned monopoly company. The carrier accounted for
about  three-quarters  of the country’s fixed phone lines and
about 45 percent of its mobile phone and fixed-line consumer
 broadband  markets, the regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
