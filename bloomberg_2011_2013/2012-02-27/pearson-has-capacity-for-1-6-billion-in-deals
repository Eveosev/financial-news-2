Pearson Plc (PSON) , the publisher of the
Financial Times newspaper, has headroom for 1 billion pounds of
acquisitions ($1.6 billion) as e-books and digital publishing
drive revenue growth.  Pearson predicts growth in revenue and operating profit,
which excludes gains from the sales of subsidiaries, in 2012 as
increased digital transactions offset “weak” advertising and
the effect of lower college enrollment in  North America , the
London-based company said in a statement today.  Pearson made offers to buy at least a dozen companies last
year while building up its education business, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg. Acquisitions contributed 262 million
pounds to 2011 sales, the company said.  For acquisitions “we have talked about our priorities and
they haven’t changed a lot,” Chief Executive Officer Marjorie Scardino said on a conference call. “Mostly education in
 emerging markets , and they are about building our interest in
vocational and career workplace education and of course anytime
we see a hole in our technology.”  The digital publishing business grew 18 percent to 2
billion pounds to make up a third of Pearson’s sales last year
after revenue from Penguin e-books doubled and digital
subscriptions to the Financial Times and online learning
programs for students increased by more than 20 percent.
Operating cash flow fell to 983 million pounds last year from
1.06 billion pounds.  Net income declined to 957 million pounds, or 119.3 pence
per share, from 1.3 billion pounds, or 161.5 pence, a year
earlier. Pearson had a gain in 2010 from selling its 61 percent
stake in Interactive Data Corp.  Pearson fell 1.8 percent to 1,229 pence at 8:33 a.m. in
 London , paring the gain this year to 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
