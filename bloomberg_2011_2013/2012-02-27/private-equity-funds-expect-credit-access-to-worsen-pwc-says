Private equity funds expect the
situation in the markets and access to credit to worsen this
year, according to a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  Some 51 percent of the 170 private equity companies
included in the study said they believe it will be more
difficult to get funding, while 47 percent expect markets to
deteriorate, PwC said in an e-mailed statement today.  Still, 46 percent forecast rising investment volumes while
37 percent see a higher number of exits in 2012, according to
the study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
