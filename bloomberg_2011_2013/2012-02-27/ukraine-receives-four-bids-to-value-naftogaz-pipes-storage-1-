Ukraine  received four bids to value
state-owned NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy’s pipelines and gas storage,
said Deputy Chief Executive Officer Vadym Chuprun.  Ukrainian subsidiaries of Ernst & Young LLP, Baker Tilly
and  Duff & Phelps Corp. (DUF)  as well as Kiev-based Thomas & Simonova
bid to value Naftogaz, Chupron said today.  Naftogaz seeks to have an independent market estimation of
the worth of its pipelines, underground gas storage facilities
and other infrastructure after the government decided last year
to assess the value of the country’s transportation system.  Russia ’s OAO Gazprom supplies about 20 percent of the
European Union’s gas needs through Ukraine’s pipes. Ukraine
seeks to renegotiate the terms of a 10-year gas supply and
transit accord with Russia from 2009, saying the present deal is
too strenuous for the state budget and for individuals.  “Ukraine’s gas transportation system is a strategic
facility, is an asset which has to help economic growth and it
is a serious political argument,” Energy and Coal Industry
Minister  Yuriy Boyko  said today.  Ukraine needs Russia for guarantees on transit volumes and
investments in pipelines, Boyko said on Jan. 18. Ukraine favors
forming a group with the EU and Russia to manage its pipeline
system, he said.  The cost of modernizing Ukraine’s gas pipelines will be
$5.3 billion over seven years, Chuprun said Sept. 23, according
to  Kommersant-Ukraine .  To contact the reporters on this story:
