Lithuanian inflation, calculated
according to European Union standards, will probably accelerate
to 3.6 percent in February on rising fuel and heating prices,
the  statistics office  said.  The inflation rate may rise from 3.4 percent in January,
the Vilnius-based office said today on its website. Consumer
prices will probably rise 0.3 percent from the previous month on
fuel prices, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
