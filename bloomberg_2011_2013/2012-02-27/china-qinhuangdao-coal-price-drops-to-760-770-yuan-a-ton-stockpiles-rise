Benchmark thermal coal prices at
 China ’s Qinhuangdao, the nation’s biggest delivery port for the
fuel, fell for the third week as inventories continued to climb
on slowing demand.  Coal with an energy value of 5,500 kilocalories per
kilogram fell 0.6 percent to a range of 760 yuan ($121) to 770
yuan a metric ton as of yesterday compared with a week earlier,
according to data today from the China Coal Transport and
Distribution Association. That’s the lowest since March 21.  Coal inventories at power stations were higher this year
compared with last, with major plants holding the equivalent of
22 days of demand as of Feb. 10 versus 17 days a year earlier,
 according to data  from the association.  Stockpiles at Qinhuangdao, which delivers half of China’s
seaborne coal supplies, rose for the eighth straight week to
8.25 million tons as of yesterday, an increase of 3.7 percent
from a week earlier, according to the data today.  Prices may fall 5 percent this year and another 10 percent
in 2013 as domestic coal production outpaces demand and
transport constraints ease, according to estimates by Sanford C.
