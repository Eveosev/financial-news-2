Hiscox Ltd. (HSX) , the second-biggest
Lloyd’s of London insurer by market value, said Robert Hiscox
will step down as chairman in 2013 after 47 years with the firm.  The insurer is searching for a replacement for Hiscox, 69,
who has led the company since his father died in 1970, the
Hamilton, Bermuda-based firm said today in a statement. He will
retain an advisory role after retiring from the main board, he
said in a telephone interview.  “I will have an office here, be here to give advice and
talk to the troops because I love the business,” Hiscox said.
“It’s got my name over the door so I’m very keen to make sure
that it thrives.”  Hiscox built the firm from a Lloyd’s underwriting
partnership to a global insurer and reinsurer with 28 offices in
11 countries in  Europe  and the U.S. in a career at the company
spanning almost 50 years. He joined the insurer, in which his
father was a partner, in 1965, becoming its chairman eight years
later. He led the firm’s initial public offering in 1997.  The firm specializes in natural catastrophe, art and
kidnapping insurance while getting about a third of its revenue
from reinsurance, which provides protection to primary insurers.  Before 2011, the insurer made a profit each year since the
terrorist attacks on  New York  in 2001. The company’s share price
is up 13 percent over the last 12 months, outperforming the 10-
member FTSE ASX Nonlife Insurance Index, which is down 10.3
percent in that period. The stock has quadrupled since its IPO
in 1997.  ‘Grim Times’  Beyond expanding the insurer, Hiscox has had a wider
influence on the  London  insurance market. He served as deputy
chairman of Lloyd’s from 1993 to 1995, employing the
reconstruction and renewal strategy that saved it from meltdown
in the early 1990s, when insurers were hurt by a reinsurance
bubble and surging claims for asbestos-related injuries.  “They were grim times because people were losing money but
incredibly exciting,” Hiscox said. “To help rescue a great big
institution was a fascinating experience. We did everything the
banks should be doing now.”  Hiscox helped bring capital from institutional investors
into Lloyd’s, by and large ending the 300-year tradition of
“names” in the marketplace. Names were wealthy individuals who
invested in the market while assuming unlimited liability for
losses. Many names were bankrupted in the 1990s, when Lloyd’s
was close to collapse.  Net Income Declines  The insurer’s net income fell to 21.3 million pounds ($33.8
million) in the 12 months to Dec. 31, compared with 178.8
million pounds a year earlier, after the most costly year for
natural disasters on record. That beat the 12 million-pound loss
 estimated  by 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The  stock  climbed 2.4 percent to 419.7 pence a share,
valuing the company at about 1.6 billion pounds. Only Amlin Plc,
at 1.8 billion pounds, has a larger market value among Lloyd’s
of London companies.  Earthquakes in  Japan  and  New Zealand , windstorms in the
U.S. and flooding in Thailand cost insurers about $105 billion
last year, topping the $101 billion paid out in 2005, the year
 Hurricane Katrina  struck  New Orleans , according to  Munich Re .  Fellow Lloyd’s insurers such as  Catlin Group Ltd. (CGL)  and
Beazley Plc said earlier this month that premium rates are
rising at least 4 percent as insurers raise prices to make up
for losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
