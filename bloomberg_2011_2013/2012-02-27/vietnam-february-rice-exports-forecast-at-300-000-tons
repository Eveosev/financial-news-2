Vietnam , the worldâ€™s second-biggest
rice exporter, may ship 300,000 metric tons this month,
according to figures released today from the General Statistics
Office in Hanoi, 39 percent less than in the same period last
year.  Exports in the first two months of the year were estimated
at 556,000 tons, down 46 percent from a year earlier. The nation
exported 256,000 tons in January, 2.4 percent higher than a
previous assessment of 250,000 tons, revised figures from the
Statistics Office show.  Vietnam exported 495,000 tons in February last year
according to preliminary GSO data.  --Nick Heath and Diep Ngoc Pham. Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
