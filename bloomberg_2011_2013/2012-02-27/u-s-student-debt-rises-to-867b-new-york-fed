Debt from educational loans in the
U.S. rose to $867 billion last quarter, according to the  Federal
Reserve Bank of New York .  The total increased from $865 billion three months earlier,
according to a report released today. The figure comprised both
federally backed loans, which are secured by the U.S.
government, and private borrowing. While the majority of loans
are taken by students, parents also incur debt in their own name
to pay for childrenâ€™s colleges.  The New York Fed in August reported outstanding student
loan debt at $550 billion and later revised the number to $845
billion. The bank is adjusting historical figures because of
technical issues in how used to obtain student-loan data,
 according to a November report .  The loan totals are based on figures from a random sample
of people with a social security number, typically ages 19 years
or older, provided by the  Equifax Inc. (EFX)  credit bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
