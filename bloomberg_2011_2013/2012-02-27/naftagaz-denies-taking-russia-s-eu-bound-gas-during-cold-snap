Ukraine’s state energy company NAK
Naftogaz Ukrainy said it didn’t take any Russian natural gas
bound for the  Europe  Union this month, rebuffing earlier
comments from its neighbor.  Russian gas shipments were short by 24 million cubic meters
a day when they reached Ukraine’s eastern border over a 3-week
period, Naftogaz said today in an e-mailed statement. Deliveries
averaged 110 million cubic meters a day in that time, it said.  OAO Gazprom, Russia’s natural-gas export monopoly, said on
Feb. 2 that Ukraine was taking “significantly” more fuel than
contracted. Russia reduced gas exports to parts of Europe in
early February during a spell of freezing weather, according to
the EU.  Naftogaz fulfilled its transit obligations, Naftogaz’s
Deputy Chief Executive Officer Vadym Chuprun said in the
statement. Ukraine’s gas transportation system is efficient and
reliable, he said. Gazprom should provide for necessary gas
reserves in Ukrainian underground storage facilities to avoid
“problems”, Chuprun said.  Pipelines being built by  Russia  to bypass Ukraine won’t
ensure stability of supply at times of seasonal fluctuations,
according to Naftogaz.  To contact the reporters on this story:
