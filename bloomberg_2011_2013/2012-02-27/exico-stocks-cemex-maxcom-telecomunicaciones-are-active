The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading.  The IPC  index  fell 0.4 percent to 37,785.72.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO)  , the largest cement maker in the
Americas, advanced 5.4 percent to 9.96 pesos. Cemex rallied
after announcing plans to exchange as much as $1.2 billion of
2014 euro-denominated debt for new securities due in 2019. An
equity or equity-linked offering in the next year seems less
likely after the announcement, as “it mitigates any dilution
risk in the next twelve months and that’s why I think the equity
reaction has been very positive today,” Benjamin Theurer, a
Barclays Bank Plc analyst, said in a telephone interview from
New York.  Maxcom Telecomunicaciones SAB (MAXCOMCP MM), the fifth-
largest land-line phone carrier in Mexico, dropped 3.6 percent
to 3.22 pesos. The company’s shares “should face pressure”
after Maxcom reported fourth-quarter results “under our
expectations,” analysts at Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit led by
James Rivett wrote in a research note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
