Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and a trade group
for college bookstores settled a lawsuit over Amazon’s
advertising for textbook discounts, the group said.  The biggest online retailer was advertising discounts of 30
percent on new college textbooks and 90 percent on used ones. In
May, Amazon asked a federal court in  Seattle , where the company
is based, to declare that its advertising wasn’t false or
misleading.  Amazon provided the methodology by which it substantiates
its savings claims to the National Association of College
Bookstores Inc., the group said in an e-mailed statement today.
While not endorsing the methodology or the results obtained, the
trade group agreed there’s no current dispute about the
advertising claims, according to the statement.  Amazon and the group agreed not to challenge each other
about the advertising claims for one year. The settlement didn’t
include an exchange of money, the group said.  Mary Osako, spokeswoman for Amazon, didn’t immediately
return an e-mail message seeking comment about the settlement.  The case is Amazon.com v. National Association of College
Stores Inc., 11-754, U.S. District Court, Western District of
 Washington  (Seattle).  To contact the reporter on this story:
