Oando Plc (OANDO) , a Nigerian energy
company, headed for its highest close in more than six weeks as
investors bet the lows its shares reached early this month was
overdone.  The stock jumped by the daily limit of 5 percent to 21.11
naira as of 12:22 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital. A close
at this level would be the highest since Jan. 11.  Oando closed at 55 naira a share on May 11 and hovered near
its lowest level in five years on Feb. 2 at 16.3 naira,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock has fallen 4
percent this year compared with a 1.7 percent decline in the
Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index.  “Its price has fallen too low, compared with where it is
coming from,” Emeka Madubuike, managing director of Lagos-based
Compass Investments and Securities Limited, said by phone today.  Investors believe its price will rise again because “it is
a well-diversified oil marketing company with several income
streams,” Madubuike said.  Oando signed a 12-billion naira ($76 million) contract with
Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s Nigerian unit, Meka Olowola, a spokesman
for the company, said in a statement Feb. 6. Oando will deploy
its OES Passion swamp rig, which can drill as much as 25,000
feet, to a Shell field in the Niger River delta for two years,
Meka said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
