Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  will release a Skype
video-calling application for its Windows Phone marketplace,
aiming to use last year’s $8.5 billion  acquisition  of Skype
Technologies SA to boost the popularity of its mobile software.  Microsoft plans to have the app available in April, Terry Myerson, head of the Redmond, Washington-based company’s mobile
business, said in an interview last week. It will unveil the
software today at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona,  Spain ,
and release a version for beta testers.  Microsoft bought Skype to gain customers and enhance its
existing products -- such as Windows phones and Xbox game
consoles, along with Internet-calling and videoconferencing
software. Skype customers made more than 300 billion minutes of
calls last year, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer  Steve Ballmer 
said in January. The service, which handles both voice and video
calls, is the top provider of international calling.  Windows Phone has just 2 percent of the mobile operating-
system market, and lags behind  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and Google Inc. in
providing apps. Both those rivals already have Skype apps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
