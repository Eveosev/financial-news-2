Greece  had its long-term sovereign
credit ratings cut to selective default from CC by Standard &
Poor’s Ratings Services, which cited an action by Greece’s
government regarding its sovereign debt that began a
“distressed debt restructuring.”  The downgrade was triggered after Greece retroactively
inserted collective action clauses in the documentation of
certain sovereign debt series last week, according to S&P.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
