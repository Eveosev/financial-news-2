Serbia  is moving toward being named
a candidate for European Union membership after striking a
compromise on the diplomatic recognition of  Kosovo , its former
province, an EU official said.  EU governments are likely to declare Serbia a candidate
tomorrow after 24 of the bloc’s 27 foreign ministers spoke out
in favor at a Brussels meeting today, said the official, who
declined to be named in line with EU rules.  Candidate status is Serbia’s reward for allowing
representatives of the Kosovo government to take part in
international meetings, even though it still refuses to
recognize the province’s 2008 breakaway.  “Serbia has fulfilled the requirements for candidate
status,” Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt told reporters.  The status would move Serbia closer to starting EU entry
talks, though without a set timeline or guarantee of admission.
 Turkey , for example, has made little progress toward joining
since being welcomed as a candidate in 1999.  Poland, Romania and Lithuania voiced concerns about making
the offer to Serbia, though without threatening to block it, the
EU official said.  EU foreign-policy chief  Catherine Ashton  said she hopes
governments will give Serbia the green light at tomorrow’s
meeting.  The agreement between Serbia and Kosovo “marks a new
turning point in moving toward,” she said today in Brussels at
a briefing with Serbian President  Boris Tadic . “I have long
believed that Serbia’s place is in the European Union.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
