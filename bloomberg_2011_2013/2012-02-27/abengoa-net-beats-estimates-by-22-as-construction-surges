Abengoa SA (ABG) ’s net income jumped last
year, exceeding analysts’ estimates by 22 percent as sales from
its engineering and construction division surged.  The Seville-based company, which develops solar thermal
power plants, builds power transmission lines and ethanol
refining facilities, posted profit of 257.4 million euros
($345.1 million) compared with a mean forecast of 210.3 million
euros in a survey of 13 analysts. Profit rose 24 percent from a
year ago.  Abengoa aimed to boost its sales and reduce its borrowings
in 2011 selling its Telvent business to  Schneider Electric SA (SU) , a
300 million-euro stake to First Reserve Corp. and a parcel of
 power lines  in  Brazil  to  Cia Energetica de Minas Gerais  while
boosting output of clean energy and biofuels.  “We have prepared a very strong base to enter 2012 with
confidence,” Chief Executive Officer Manuel Sanchez Ortega said
on a conference call for investors.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization from engineering and construction rose 69 percent
to 438 million euros. Overall ebitda rose 36 percent to 1.1
billion euros. The company’s order backlog rose 20 percent to
7.5 billion euros.  Net corporate debt fell to 1.5 billion euros from 2.3
billion euros a year earlier while net non-recourse debt for
financing projects rose to 4 billion euros from 2.9 billion
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
