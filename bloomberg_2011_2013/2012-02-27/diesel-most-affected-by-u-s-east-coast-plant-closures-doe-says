Supplies of ultra-low sulfur diesel
in the U.S. East Coast may be tight for a year or more because
of refinery shutdowns and transportation constraints hampering
shipping from the  Gulf Coast , the Energy Department said.  Diesel will be “the most challenging product to replace as
there are few alternative supply sources outside of the U.S.
Gulf Coast,” the department said today in a  report . The
Northeast will also see its consumption of ULSD increase by 20
percent on average because of stricter requirements for heating
oil sulfur content that start in July in  New York .  Infrastructure changes will be necessary to accommodate the
changing product flow as the need for imports into the East
Coast increases, the department said. Companies may delay making
significant investments in new logistical arrangements until
they know the status of Sunoco Inc.’s Philadelphia refinery,
according to the report.  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  and  ConocoPhillips (COP)  have idled two Pennsylvania
refineries and Sunoco plans to shut its Philadelphia plant by
June if it can’t find a buyer. The three refineries together
represent about 50 percent of total East Coast refining
capacity.  The closure of the Philadelphia plant may leave the East
Coast short 240,000 barrels a day of gasoline next year,
according to the report. The combination of the plant shutdown
and tighter regulations will curtail diesel supply by 180,000
barrels daily, the department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
