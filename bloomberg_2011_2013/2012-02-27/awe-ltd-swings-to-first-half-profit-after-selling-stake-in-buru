AWE Ltd. (AWE) , an oil and gas explorer
planning to expand in Australia,  New Zealand  and Asia, swung to
a first-half profit after it made a gain on the sale of its
stake in  Buru Energy Ltd. (BRU)  and oil prices rose.  Net income was A$29.7 million ($31.9 million), or 5.6 cents
a share, in the six months ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss
of A$49.8 million, 22.5 cents, a year ago, the Sydney-based
company said today in a statement. Sales rose 17 percent to
A$157.6 million.  AWE is seeking acquisitions in Asia and developing shale
gas prospects in Western Australia after cutting estimates last
year for the remaining reserves at its Tui oil field in New
Zealand and reporting in 2010 that its drilling program had
failed to deliver a major discovery. Crude oil in New York
averaged $91.81 in the half, up 14 percent from the year before.  “AWE will continue to actively pursue investment in the
energy industry,” according to the statement.  The result includes a A$12.2 million profit from selling
shares in Buru Energy, the company said. The company last month
agreed to pay $39 million to acquire two oil blocks off the
Indonesian coast from  Genting Bhd. (GENT)  and to assume $100 million in
loans and receivables.  To contact the reporter on this story:
