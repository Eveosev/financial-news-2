China’s benchmark stock index  rose
to a three-month high on expectations the government will
further loosen monetary policies to spur economic growth.  Dongfeng Automobile Co. (600006)  and Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co.
jumped 10 percent after China said it included only domestic
brands in its official-vehicle purchases this year.  Inner
Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. (600111)  climbed to the
highest in five months on prospects China may almost double rare
earth exports this year. Poly Real Estate Group Co. led a gauge
of property stocks to its first decline in seven days on
earnings concerns after China Business Media reported the
company cut prices on more than 100 projects.  “The government may have more leeway to stimulate the
economy this year by increasing fiscal support,” said  Zhang Ling , general manager at Shanghai River Fund Management Co.
“Monetary easing will take place at a measured pace as economic
growth isn’t falling off a cliff.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  climbed 7.43 points, or 0.3
percent, to 2,447.06 at the close, the highest since Nov. 17.
Almost the same number of stocks rose as those that fell. The
 CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  gained 0.3 percent to 2,656.57. The  Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed
Chinese companies, added 0.1 percent on Feb. 24 in  New York .  The Shanghai Composite rallied 3.5 percent last week after
the central bank announced a cut in  reserve requirements  on Feb.
18, the second reduction in three months as a credit crunch
curbed lending to small companies. The gauge completed a sixth
weekly gain, the longest winning streak since November 2010. For
the year, the Shanghai index has rebounded 11 percent and trades
at 10.1 times estimated profit, compared with a record low of
8.9 times on Jan. 6, weekly  data  compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Economic Growth  China is likely to see little slowdown in growth this year
even as its government needs to overhaul its economy to manage
expansion over the next two decades, World Bank President  Robert Zoellick  said.  The world’s second-largest economy will probably have a
“soft landing” in the “near term,” Zoellick said at a
conference in Beijing today.  It’s time to buy China’s stocks after the CSI 300 broke
through the 2,600 level last week and entered a bullish trend,
according to Macquarie Group Ltd.’s head of China strategy. The
CSI 300 exceeded the 100-day moving average last week for the
first time since May 2011 and closed above 2,600 on Feb. 23, the
first time since Nov. 29. The index may next test resistance at
the 200-day moving average of around 2,750 to 2,800, Jiong Shao
said in an e-mailed response to questions on Feb. 24.  ‘Time to Buy’  “It is time to buy, given the decisive break out,” the
Macquarie strategist said. “The factors that will drive markets
higher include continued liquidity loosening, revival of
infrastructure construction, and lastly property policy easing
near the end of the second quarter or in the third quarter.”  Interbank deposits should be added to the calculation of
loan-to-deposit ratio for banks to help boost lending, the
Shanghai Securities News reported today, citing former People’s
Bank of China Deputy Governor  Wu Xiaoling . The average loan-to-
deposit ratio for small- and medium- sized banks would drop to
63.8 percent from 69.1 percent if added, according to the
newspaper.  “If the Chinese government will reduce banks’ reserve-
requirement ratios further and ease the credit constraints the
economy has been facing, the Chinese market will rally a little
more from here,” Kelvin Tay, chief investment strategist at UBS
Wealth Management, said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television in  London .  Automakers  Anhui Jianghuai (600418) , a unit of China’s biggest light-truck
exporter, surged by the 10 percent daily limit to 7.26 yuan.
Dongfeng Automobile, which makes light trucks with Nissan Motor
Co., jumped 10 percent to 3.81 yuan. FAW Car Co., which makes
cars with Volkswagen AG, gained 2 percent to 10.48 yuan.  China issued a preliminary list for official-vehicle
purchases this year that excludes all foreign brands. The list
contains of 412 domestic brands, the Ministry of Industry and
 Information Technology  said in a statement.  China Shipping Container Lines Co. (601866) , the country’s second-
largest carrier of sea-cargo boxes, led shipping lines higher as
U.S. data on consumer sentiment and home sales bolstered the
prospects of global trade. The stock climbed 3 percent to 3.07
yuan.  Cosco Shipping Co. (600428) , a unit of China’s biggest shipping
company, gained 2.1 percent to 4.95 yuan.  Rare-Earth Quota  Baotou Steel Rare-Earth, China’s biggest producer of rare
earth, jumped 5.6 percent to 53.03 yuan. Xiamen Tungsten Co.
rose 2.5 percent to 38.20 yuan.  “Export quotas may be met this year as overseas demand
recovers,” Wang Caifeng, a former official overseeing the rare-
earth industry with the Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology, said in an interview in Beijing.  A measure tracking property stocks in the Shanghai
Composite lost 0.4 percent today, the only decliner among the
five industry groups. It jumped 9.3 percent last week after the
Shanghai government signaled it was easing property curbs by
saying it would allow more people to buy second homes by
loosening the definition of locals.  Poly Real Estate,  China ’s second-largest developer by
market value, dropped 1.3 percent to 11.55 yuan. The company cut
prices for more than 100 projects in more than 40 cities from
the beginning of this year, China Business Media reported on its
website on Feb. 24, citing an unidentified official from the
company. China Merchants Property Development Co. slipped 0.9
percent to 20.21 yuan. Financial Street Holding Co. retreated
0.9 percent to 6.79 yuan.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., advanced less than 0.1 percent
to $40.16 on Feb. 24.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
