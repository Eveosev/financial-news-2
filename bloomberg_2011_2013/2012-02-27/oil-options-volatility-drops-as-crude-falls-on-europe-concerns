Oil options volatility declined for
a second day after crude fell after the Group of 20 nations
rebuffed calls from euro countries to increase international
lending resources, adding to concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis
will slow the economy.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 29.4 as of 1:30 p.m. in New York, down
from 30 on Feb. 24.  Crude oil for April delivery fell for the first time in
eight days, losing 82 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $108.95 a barrel
at 1:26 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after touching
$108.24 earlier.  “You’re seeing a bit of a settling off the rally,” Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York,
said by telephone. “We’ve broken out of our range, the next
test” is going to be around $112, and $115 after that, he said.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
April $119 calls. They fell 24 cents to 33 cents a barrel with
2,462 contracts trading as of 1:44 p.m. in New York. Next were
April $120 calls, which fell 19 cents to 30 cents a barrel on
1,753 lots. A contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude. Calls were
55 percent of the volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  Calls accounted for 58 percent of the volume in the
previous session. April $115 calls were the most actively traded
options, with 8,314 lots changing hands. They gained 22 cents to
$1.14 a barrel. The next-most active options, May $135 calls,
rose 11 cents to 66 cents a barrel on volume of 5,792 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 45,986
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 37,558 lots and
