Acciona SA (ANA)  Chairman Jose Manuel Entrecanales said solar thermal power plants, which use mirrors
to capture the sun’s energy, have become cheaper than
photovoltaic power in some parts of the world.  Solar mirrors are an economic alternative in mining areas
in Australia that have high levels of sunlight, strong
industrial power demand and are far from the conventional  power
grid , he said at a press conference in Madrid today. There are
similar conditions in some parts of  Latin America , he added.  “Those projects will become landmarks” for the
technology, he said. “From there we will pass on to the next
generation of efficiency.”  The prospects for solar thermal plants have been clouded
over the past year as the price of photovoltaic panels, which
generate a current directly from sunlight, tumbled after
manufacturing capacity surged in  China . The U.S., which has led
development of solar thermal plants in its south western
deserts, is also phasing out support for the generators.  The price of solar panels dropped almost 50 percent last
year forcing Solar Millenium AG, a German solar thermal
developer, to switch to panels at its main project in the U.S.
The company filed for bankruptcy last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
