Household debt in the U.S. declined
1.1 percent during the fourth quarter as real-estate borrowing
fell, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey.  Consumer indebtedness shrank $126 billion from the end of
September to $11.53 trillion on Dec. 31, according to a
quarterly report on household debt and credit released today by
the district bank. Mortgages and home-equity lines of credit
declined a combined $146 billion, and total delinquency rates
dropped to 9.8 percent of outstanding debt “in some stage of
delinquency,” from 10 percent at the end of September.  “While we continue to see improvements in the delinquent
balances and delinquency transition rates this quarter, there
has been a noticeable decrease in the rate of improvement
compared to 2009-2010,” Andrew Haughwout, vice president and
economist at the New York Fed, said in a statement. “Overall,
it appears that delinquency rates are stabilizing at levels that
remain significantly higher than pre-crisis levels.”  Three straight months of faster job growth coupled with a
stock market rally since late 2011 are helping make Americans
more optimistic about an economic recovery that Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said has been slowed by weakness in the housing
market. Policy makers last month said their benchmark  interest
rate  is likely to stay “exceptionally low” through at least
late 2014 to help the recovery gain traction, extending an
earlier date of mid-2013.  New Foreclosures  About 289,000 consumers showed new foreclosures on their
credit reports in the fourth quarter, up 9.5 percent from the
third quarter, the New York Fed’s survey showed. There were
425,000 new bankruptcies, 14.9 percent less than in the last
three months of 2010.  Mortgage originations for 2011 amounted to $1.55 trillion,
the lowest since 2000 and down 3.1 percent from 2010, according
to the New York Fed report. Bernanke and the policy-setting
 Federal Open Market Committee (FDTR)  are debating a new round of
mortgage-bond purchases to help boost the housing market and the
economy.  Non-real estate borrowing climbed $20 billion, or 0.8
percent, to $2.635 trillion, according to the New York Fed
survey.  The New York Fed report is based on data compiled by the
district bank’s Consumer Credit Panel, a “nationally
representative random sample” from Equifax Inc. credit-report
data, the statement said. The Fed’s quarterly flow of funds
report includes household debt, along with debt measures for
non-financial businesses, state and local governments and the
federal government.  Confidence among U.S. consumers rose more than forecast in
February, reaching a one-year high as Americans grew more upbeat
about the outlook for the economy.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment increased to 75.3 this month from 75 in
January. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey called
for 73, after a preliminary reading of 72.5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
