Blohm & Voss, the German shipbuilder
sold by  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  to Star Capital Partners, may be listed
on the stock exchange or sold to a strategic investor in four to
five years,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported today,
citing an interview with Blohm & Voss Managing Director Herbert Aly.  The company will be able to “safely march through” the
coming years with the capital that Star Capital will invest, Aly
said, according to the newspaper.  Blohm & Voss still expects to sign a contract with a
Russian client this year for the construction of a luxury yacht,
Aly said, adding that the company is also in negotiations about
other such projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
