The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 10:23 a.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  gained 0.3 percent to 15,005.70, while the
Colcap Index was little changed at 1,718.11.  Grupo Nutresa SA (NUTRESA)  (NUTRESA CB), Colombia’s biggest food
producer, fell for a second day, slipping 1.3 percent to 22,100
pesos. Net income declined 3.7 percent last year from a year ago
to 254 billion pesos ($143 million), according to a Feb. 24
regulatory filing.  The results failed to meet the market’s expectations as
higher raw material prices and increases in administrative and
sales expenses cut into profits, according to a Feb. 24 report
by Interbolsa analysts including Jorge Zuniga.  The incorporation of payroll expenses from the integration
of Helados Bon SA, the  Dominican Republic ’s largest ice cream
maker, led to the increase in administrative and sales expenses,
according to an e-mailed report today from Interbolsa. Nutresa
purchased a 73 percent stake in Bon last year for $38.7 million.  Petrominerales Ltd. (PMGC)  (PMGC CB), a Calgary-based company that
explores for and produces oil in  Colombia , plunged the most in
nearly three months after 2011 reserves dropped 14 percent from
the year before.  Shares fell 12 percent, the most intraday since Dec. 6, to
37,300 pesos. The company said proved and probable reserves for
2011 totaled 51.5 million barrels, a 14 percent decrease from
the year before, according to a regulatory filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
