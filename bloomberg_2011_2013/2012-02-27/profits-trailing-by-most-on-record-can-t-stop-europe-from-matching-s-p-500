European stocks are rallying just as
much as the rest of the world in the best start to a year since
1998, even as  analysts cut  earnings forecasts, profits trail
estimates by the most on record and debt-encumbered economies
stop growing.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index has  climbed  8.3 percent in 2012,
bringing the rally since last year’s low to 23 percent as the
European Central Bank loans record cash to banks at below-market
rates. While the gains have matched the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX) , European companies will earn less than ever in 2012
compared with their American counterparts, according to analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg since 2006.  Bulls say equities in the region are irresistible because
Stoxx 600  valuations  already reflect prospects of a recession,
while Greece reached an agreement for the biggest sovereign-debt
restructuring in history and the ECB may lend 470 billion euros
($633 billion) to banks. Bears say share prices have risen too
fast and government plans to reduce debt with austerity budgets
will cause years of sluggish growth.  “A lot of the negative news in terms of earnings, economic
outlook and risks coming from the sovereign problems has been
discounted,” said Joost van Leenders, an Amsterdam-based
strategist at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, which oversees
$662 billion and last week upgraded its allocation to European
equities. “Valuations are much lower in Europe than in the
U.S.”  Up, Down  The Stoxx 600  slipped  0.4 percent last week to 264.77 as
the second bailout for Greece failed to allay investor concerns.
The  S&P 500  rose 0.3 percent to 1,365.74, the highest level
since 2008. The European equity benchmark retreated 0.8 percent
and S&P 500 futures expiring next month slid 0.5 percent to
1,356.9 at 12:04 p.m. in  London  today.  Credit default swaps to insure European  government bonds 
cost more than nine times that of  U.S. government  securities, a
record, up from four times in July, according to CMA, a CME
Group Inc. business that compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market.  Siemens AG (SIE) , Royal Philips Electronics NV and 109 other
Stoxx 600 companies have reported results that  missed  analysts’
forecasts for net income since Jan. 9, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. At 52 percent, more companies have trailed
predictions than any quarter since 2006.  European stocks have rallied even as  analysts lowered
income projections  10 percent since October. Combined profits of
companies in the gauge will increase 16 percent to $32.22 a
share this year, compared with a 9.7 percent increase in the
 American index  to $104.35 a share, according to estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The ratio between the two income totals
rose to 3.3 last month in dollar terms, the biggest in data
starting in 2006.  Cutting Projections  Projections for the 30 companies in  Germany’s benchmark   DAX
Index (DAX)  slipped 9.7 percent in the same period, while those for
 Italy ’s 40-company FTSE MIB Index plunged 18 percent. The
reduction for the Stoxx 600 was 3.5 percentage points greater
than the S&P 500’s, the data show.  Stocks are rising even with lower forecasts because
“people are more comfortable buying into companies where
earnings estimates have been reset to levels where they can only
improve,” said Priyanthan Kodeeswaran, who helps oversee about
$4 billion at RWC Partners in London. “The big question for
Europe is obviously the political side and the potential credit
crunch. But we are finding value.”  The Stoxx 600’s  price-earnings ratio  has expanded 34
percent to 13.4 since its low point in September, compared with
the S&P 500’s 22 percent increase since Oct. 3 to 14.1. Both
remain more than 10 percent below the average since the  bull
market  began in March 2009, Bloomberg data show.  ‘Not Attractive’  “Valuations are not attractive anymore,” and should be 10
percent to 15 percent lower, James Butterfill, who helps oversee
$49 billion as a global equity strategist at Coutts & Co. in
London, said in a Feb. 23 phone interview. The ECB bailout of
banks “certainly puts a floor on equities, but it is probably
priced in,” he said.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  lowered the euro area’s key
interest rate twice since November and on Dec. 21 awarded 489
billion euros in loans to 523 banks to keep credit flowing.
Financial institutions will ask the ECB for 470 billion euros in
three-year funds for allotment on Feb. 29, according to the
median of 28 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  S&P cut the ratings of nine euro-area nations on Jan. 13,
stripping  France  of the top debt ranking and leaving  Germany  as
the only economy in the region with a stable AAA grade. The
yield on 10-year Portuguese bonds rose to a euro-era record of
18.29 percent on Jan. 31. A “sizable” sovereign-debt
restructuring is likely in the country over the next 12 to 18
months and more restructuring in  Greece  is likely, Citigroup
Inc.’s chief economist,  Willem Buiter , wrote on Feb. 22.  Economist Forecasts  Gross domestic product in the euro area may contract 0.4
percent in 2012 while U.S. growth accelerates to 2.2 percent,
according to the median estimate of 25 and 79 economists,
respectively, in a Bloomberg survey. The 17 nations sharing the
single currency will shrink 0.3 percent in 2012, the European
Commission said last week, abandoning a November forecast of 0.5
percent growth, mostly because of projected contractions of 1.3
percent in Italy and 1 percent in  Spain .  Neither the prospect of a recession nor worse-than-
estimated earnings have kept investors from buying European
equities. The Stoxx 600 is up 15 percent since Aug. 24, the last
time the median forecast for 2012 growth was higher than 1.5
percent, Bloomberg data show.  Lower Profits  Declining profitability in its four main units pushed
 results  at Munich-based Siemens, Europe’s largest engineering
company, below analyst estimates on Jan. 24. Amsterdam-based
Philips, the world’s biggest lightbulb maker, said Jan. 30 it’s
“cautious” about 2012 after writedowns, sluggish sales and
costs to exit a television business led to its biggest loss in a
decade. Siemens has gained 1.5 percent this year, and Philips
has climbed 1.8 percent since reporting the results.  Essen, Germany-based  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) , the country’s largest
steelmaker, posted a  first-quarter loss  on Feb. 14 after project
delays and cost overruns and said it was unable to give a
“reliable” outlook given the sovereign-debt crisis. The stock
surged 16 percent in 2012.  Legrand SA, the world’s largest maker of wiring devices,
reported earnings that missed analyst estimates on Feb. 9 and
said its operating margin may fall in 2012 as sales stagnate
because of southern Europe’s economic slump. Shares of the
Limoges, France-based company have rallied 11 percent this year.  Bank Rally  An  index of banks  in the Stoxx 600 has risen 15 percent in
2012, even after falling 1.6 percent today.  Belgium ’s  KBC Groep
NV (KBC)  and Italy’s  Banca Popolare di Milano Scarl (PMI)  helped lead gains
as government bonds in those countries rallied. The banks fell
at least 60 percent in 2011.  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  has gained 49 percent in 2012. The
Frankfurt-based lender announced plans on Feb. 23 that may boost
capital by more than 1 billion euros.  Banks (SX70)  in the Stoxx 600 are
trading at 0.7 times book value, compared with the average of
1.5 times since 2002.  “The carcass has now been picked over so thoroughly, I
think it’s much less risky,”  Barton Biggs , founder of hedge
fund Traxis Partners LP in  New York , said in a Feb. 23 interview
with Bloomberg Television, adding that he bought a basket of
Italian stocks this year weighted “heavily” toward banks.

it.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
