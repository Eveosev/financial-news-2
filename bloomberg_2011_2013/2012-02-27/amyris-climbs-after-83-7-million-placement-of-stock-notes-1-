Amyris Inc. (AMRS) , the U.S. biotechnology
company, gained the most in more than two weeks after it sold
$58.7 million of shares in a private placement and agreed to
sell $25 million in notes to boost its working capital.  Amyris climbed 7.9 percent to $6.44 at the close in New
York, the biggest gain since Feb. 9.  The company sold the shares for $5.78 each to existing
investors and new ones, including Biolding Investment SA, a
company owned by Qatar’s former prime minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Emeryville, California-based Amyris said
today in a statement.  Biolding Investment agreed to purchase $15 million of
additional common stock after Amyris completes a production
plant in  Brazil , according to the statement. The 3 percent
senior unsecured notes are due in 2017 and may be converted to
shares.  Existing investors Temasek Holdings Pte,  Total SA (FP) , and
Naxos Capital Partners also participated in the private
placement, Amyris said. Other new investors included Amyris
board members John Doerr, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield
& Byers, and Fernando Reinach, a general partner at Votorantim
Participacoes SA’s venture arm.  The notes, which will be sold to an institutional investor
that wasn’t identified, have a conversion price of $7.0682 a
share, an 18 percent premium over Amyris’s Feb. 24 closing
price.  To contact the reporters on this story:
