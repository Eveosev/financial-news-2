Bidvest Group Ltd. (BVT) , an industrial
holding company with interests from grain-handling to car
retailing, said it will pay a special dividend of 80 cents a
share as first-half profit surged and trading improved.  The company also increased its interim shareholder payout
by 24 percent to 2.80 rand, Johannesburg-based Bidvest said in a
statement today. Net income in the six months through December
climbed 27 percent to 2.2 billion rand ($264 million).  “Economic conditions in  South Africa  have improved,”
Bidvest said. “Activity levels are anticipated to improve
within the European geographies in which the group operates but
 consumer confidence  remains fragile. In Asia Pacific, management
are confident of further growth.”  The sale of Bidvest’s 50 percent stake in Mumbai
International Airport generated 399.1 million rand in profit, it
said. The company, with 4.3 billion rand in cash at the end of
the first half,  has “ample capacity” to fund growth of
existing businesses and make acquisitions to expand its
geographic footprint and product and service offering, Bidvest
said.  The stock has  gained  15 percent over the past six months
compared with a 13 percent increase in the  FTSE/JSE Africa Top40
Index (TOP40) .  To contact the reporter on this story: Sikonathi Mantshantsha in
