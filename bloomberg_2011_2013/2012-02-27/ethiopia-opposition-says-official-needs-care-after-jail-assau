An imprisoned Ethiopian opposition
leader needs urgent medical attention 12 days after being
assaulted in his cell, former President Negasso Gidada said.  Andualem Aragie, head of public relations for the Unity for
Democracy and Justice Party, was kicked in the head and beaten
by a fellow prisoner on Feb. 15, Negasso, the chairman of the
party, said by phone today from  Addis Ababa , the capital.  Andualem, who is being tried on terrorism charges, had to
be supported by prison guards when his wife went to see him,
Negasso said. “He complained yesterday he has a headache and
has problems with his balance,” the ex-president said. “He
needs urgent treatment and examination by a private medical
doctor.”  Andualem could not be examined when taken to a police
hospital because the equipment was not working, according to
Negasso. A prison doctor saw him last week and said he was
suffering from low  blood pressure , said Negasso. “No serious
medical attention has been given,” he said. “His wife is very
much worried. We are also very worried.”  Ethiopia’s human rights commissioner, Teruneh Zenna, said
today that he would again contact the “relevant authorities”
about the case, Negasso said. Teruneh did not answer his mobile
phone when called seeking comment. The party also plans to write
to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, Negasso said.  The trial of Andualem and 23 others is scheduled to resume
next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
