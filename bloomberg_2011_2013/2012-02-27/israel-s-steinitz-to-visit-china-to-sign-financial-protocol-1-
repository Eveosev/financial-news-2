Israeli Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz will travel to  China  tonight to sign a financial
protocol aimed at boosting sales overseas.  The protocol will help exporters of Israeli water
technology for agriculture, Israel’s Finance Ministry said in an
e-mailed statement today.  “The upgrading of Israeli economic relations with China
and boosting exports to this country are a strategic goal of
primary importance for the Israeli economy,” the statement
cited Steinitz as saying.  Israel is seeking to boost sales to fast-growing economies
such as  China (CNGDPYOY)  and  India  as  Europe  struggles with a debt crisis
and global trade slows. Exports account for about 40 percent of
Israel’s gross domestic product.  Steinitz visited China in May 2010 with Environmental
Protection Minister Gilad Erdan, to help promote economic ties.
Erdan said at the time that Israeli companies have “endless”
possibilities to sell technology to China, specifically in the
areas of water recycling, desalination and solar power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
