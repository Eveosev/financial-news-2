PT Perusahaan  Listrik Negara ,
 Indonesia ’s state-owned utility, is in talks to buy 1 million
metric tons a year of liquefied natural gas from  BP Plc’s (BP/) 
Tangguh plant in West Papua province.  “We are looking for a long-term contract of more than 10
years,” Nur Pamudji, the president director of the electricity
supplier, said in an interview in Jakarta today. The cleaner-
burning fuel will be used to supply a floating terminal in
offshore North Sumatra, which will be built by PT Perusahaan  Gas
Negara (PGAS) , he said.  BP is in talks with Listrik Negara, William Lin, BP’s Asia
Pacific president, said today in an e-mailed response to
questions. The London-based explorer, which has a 37-percent
share in the Tangguh project, can’t disclose further details,
Lin said.  Indonesia, the world’s second-largest exporter of LNG after
Qatar, is trying to boost natural gas and coal usage in power
stations as oil production declines in aging fields.  BP will amend a supply contract with  Sempra (SRE)  Energy to
divert LNG supplies earmarked for Sempra’s terminal in  Mexico  to
other buyers, including domestic customers, the nation’s oil and
gas regulator, BPMigas, said Feb. 16.  Listrik Negara will use the Belawan LNG terminal to
regasify the fuel before supplying to its power plant in North
Sumatra, Heri Yusup, the corporate secretary at Jakarta-based
Gas Negara said. Gas Negara may start operating the facility,
which will have capacity as much as 2 million metric tons a
year, in 2013, Yusup said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
