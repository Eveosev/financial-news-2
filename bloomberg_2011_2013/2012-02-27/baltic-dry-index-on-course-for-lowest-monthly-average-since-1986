The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a measure of
commodity shipping costs, is on course for its lowest monthly
average in more than 25 years as an oversupply of vessels keeps
hire costs below break-even levels.  The index has averaged about 698 so far this month,
according to the London-based  Baltic Exchange . It’s closing in
on the worst performance since the average level of about 587 in
August 1986, figures compiled by Bloomberg show. Today the
measure rose for a third session, led by higher rates for
Capesize ships that carry iron ore.  The gauge has plunged 58 percent this year after  China ’s
New Year holiday closed markets in the country for a week in
January, sapping cargo demand and worsening a glut of dry-bulk
commodity carriers. Earnings for the global fleet of more than
9,000 ships reached all-time lows on some routes this month as
new-vessel numbers increased amid a seasonal slump in demand.  “Pessimism is running rampant,” Cantor Fitzgerald LP said
in an e-mailed report. Earnings for Capesizes and Panamaxes, the
two largest dry-bulk vessel types, are below cash break-even
levels and deteriorating further, the New York-based investment
bank  said .  The index gained 1.7 percent to 730 as Capesize hire costs
climbed to the highest level since Jan. 25, figures from the
exchange showed. Average daily  Capesize (BCAVRT)  rents rose 3.9 percent
to $5,921, still only 33 percent of the $18,000 the vessels must
earn to break even, according to Oslo-based investment bank
Pareto Securities AS.  $12,000 a Day  More owners and operators were agreeing to hire out vessels
for periods of four to six months rather than accept lower
single-voyage rates,  Cantor Fitzgerald  said. Costs to charter
Capesizes and Panamaxes for single voyages slid 11 percent last
week to respective levels of $3,167 and $4,736, according to its
calculations. Hiring a Capesize for up to six months costs about
$12,000 daily, it said.  “This is a strong indicator that owners are beginning to
capitulate in the face of persistent spot earnings well below
cash breakeven,” the bank said.  Dry-bulk freight rates will remain at loss-making levels at
least until 2013, with a record number of new vessels scheduled
to enter service this year, Nomura Equity Research said in a
report last week.  Average daily rents for Panamaxes, the largest ships to
navigate the Panama Canal, slid 0.3 percent to $6,683, according
to the exchange, extending last week’s 12 percent retreat.
Charter costs for the ships in the Atlantic dropped 1.1 percent
to $4,438, remaining at the lowest level since January 2009.  Supramax (BSRATCR)  vessels that are about 25 percent smaller than
Panamaxes gained 2.5 percent to $7,090. Handysizes, the smallest
ships in the index, rose 1 percent to $6,042.  To contact the reporter on this story:
