Egyptian General Petroleum Corp.,
the nation’s state-owned oil marketing company, is seeking to

June, said two traders who participate in the market.  EGPC, as the company is known, plans to purchase as much as
660,000 metric tons of gasoil with 0.2 percent sulfur for
delivery to the ports of Alexandria and El Dekheila, according
to the people, who declined to be identified because the
information is confidential. The tender closes today, the
traders said.  An EGPC official in Cairo declined to comment when
