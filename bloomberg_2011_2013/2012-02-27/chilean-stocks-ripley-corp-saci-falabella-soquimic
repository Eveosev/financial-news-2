The following companies had unusual

index retreated 0.3 percent to 2,610.60.  Lan Airlines SA (LAN)   retreated 0.7 percent to 12,915
pesos, its third day of losses and its longest losing streak in
two months.  Latin America ’s largest airline by market value was
the most active stock by value today in Santiago, with 11.7
billion pesos ($24 million) changing hands. It fell in line with
European markets after the Group of 20 nations rebuffed calls
from the euro area for more bailout funding.  Ripley Corp SA (RIPLEY)  , Chile’s third-largest

Banco Santander SA said a fire that destroyed one of Ripley’s
stores in southern  Chile  is a “non-event” for the stock price.  Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile SA  (SQM/B CC), Chile’s
largest fertilizer producer, dropped 0.8 percent to 28,509
pesos. Wholesale potash inventories in the U.S. reached the
highest level since December 2009, which suggests weaker supply
and demand imbalances, Bloomberg Industries wrote in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
