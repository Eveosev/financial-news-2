Most Japanese  stocks  rose as the
yen’s drop to a nine-month low against the dollar brightened the
earnings outlook for the nation’s exporters. Gains were limited
as technical indicators suggested the market was overbought.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
rose 1.2 percent. Parco Co. surged 11 percent after J Front
Retailing Co. agreed to buy a 33 percent stake in the shopping-
center operator.  Inpex Corp. (1605)  led mining companies lower as crude
fell from its highest level in more than nine months.  The broader Topix Index gained 0.1 percent to 835.25 as of
the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, with about eight stocks advancing for
every seven that rose. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.1
percent to 9,633.93 after swinging between gains and losses at
least seven times.  “It’s huge fuel for Japanese exporters if the yen can
maintain or continue to depreciate,” said  Tim Schroeders , who
helps manage $1 billion in equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in
 Melbourne . “I think the downside risk has mitigated and as a
result investors are happier to embrace a more positive
outlook.”  The yen touched 81.67 per dollar today, the lowest level
since May 31. A weaker yen boosts Japanese companies’ overseas
earnings. Sony advanced 1.2 percent to 1,760 yen.  Honda Motor
Co. (7267) , Japan’s second-largest carmaker by market value, rose 1.6
percent to 3,140 yen.  U.S. Housing  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  lost 0.2 percent
today. The gauge added 0.2 percent in  New York  on Feb. 24,
capping a second weekly gain, after  Greece  secured a second debt
bailout and U.S. new homes sales beat estimates in January.
Stocks also rose after consumer sentiment reached a one-year
high in the world’s largest economy.  Mining firms fell the most among the 33 Topix industry
groups as oil slid after the  International Monetary Fund  warned
the global economy is still at risk of a slowdown.  Inpex, Japan’s No. 1 energy explorer, fell 2.5 percent to
588,000 yen. Smaller Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. dropped 2
percent to 3,985 yen.  Parco Jumps  Parco surged 11 percent to 855 yen after J Front Retailing,
Japan’s second-largest department-store operator, agreed to pay
30.1 billion yen ($371 million) for a stake in the fashion
retailer. J Front lost 0.4 percent to 392 yen.  Gains in stocks were limited as the 14-day relative
strength index for the Nikkei 225 had a reading of 80 today,
above the 70 threshold that indicates to some traders that an
asset has been overbought and may fall.  Japan’s TSE Second Section Price Index (TSE2) , a measure of
smaller companies on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, rose today for
the 30th day, its longest stretch of gains ever, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg stretching back to 1961. The gauge
added 0.3 percent to 2,381.96.  The Topix has risen 6.2 percent since Feb. 14, when the
 Bank of Japan  joined a global spree of monetary easing by
increasing its government-bond purchases, weakening the yen. The
gain has boosted the  value  of stocks listed on the Topix to 1
times estimated book value, up from 0.8 in November, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. A number below 1 means companies
can be bought for less than value of their assets.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 6.6 percent to 22.20,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.4 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Japanese market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after
company names.  Fujitsu Ltd. (6702)  (6702 JT), a Japanese computer maker, gained
1.8 percent to 445 yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported that
Fujitsu and  Mitsui & Co. (8031)  will set up a community venture in
Japan. Mitsui rose 0.1 percent to 1,397 yen.  Softbank Corp. (9984)  (9984 JT), a mobile phone carrier, fell 2.6
percent to 2,359 yen after a report it plans to hire as many as
2,400 additional employees, according to the Nikkei.  Tokyo Dome Corp. (9681)  (9681 JT), a stadium operator and hotelier,
rose 3.7 percent to 226 yen after reporting preliminary net
income of 300 million yen for the year ended Jan. 31, beating
its earlier projection for a loss, citing high hotel occupancy
and cost cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
