China ’s money-market rate declined
to the lowest level in two weeks on speculation the cash supply
will improve following a cut in banks’ reserve requirements.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, fell for a second day after the central
bank’s second reduction in the amount of cash lenders must set
aside took effect on Feb. 24. The People’s Bank of China gauged
demand for three-month bill sales planned for this week,
according to a trader at a primary dealer required to bid at the
auctions.  “The market is starting to react to the new reserve
ratio,” said Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at Industrial Bank Co.
in  Shanghai . “If the sale of three-month bills resumes on
Thursday, that may show the central bank is very cautious about
implementing easing measures.”  The  repo rate  dropped 82 basis points, or 0.82 percentage
point, to 3.66 percent as of 4:55 p.m. in Shanghai, according to
a weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. It touched 3.63 percent, the lowest since Feb. 10.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, rose one basis point
to 3.36 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The monetary authority has suspended auctions of three-
month bills for nine weeks and  one-year  notes for eight weeks.  The yield on the 3.14 percent government bonds due February
2017 dropped one basis point to 3.21 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
