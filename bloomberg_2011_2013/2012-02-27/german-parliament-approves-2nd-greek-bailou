Germany ’s lower house of parliament
approved a second euro-region Greek bailout package worth 130
billion euros ($174 billion).  The lower house, or Bundestag, voted 496 in favor of the
measure; 90 voted against, while five abstained in Berlin today.  European leaders’ efforts to stave off a collapse of the
 Greek economy  may win time to resolve the region’s debt crisis,
now in its third year. With parliamentary passage of the Greek
measures, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others will shift
their focus on whether to bolster the region’s bailout firewall
as they prepare for a summit meeting in Brussels on March 1-2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
