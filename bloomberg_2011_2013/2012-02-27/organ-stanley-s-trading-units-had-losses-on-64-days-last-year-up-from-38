Morgan Stanley (JEF) , owner of the world’s
biggest brokerage, lost money in its trading businesses on 64
days last year, up from 38 days in 2010 and the most since 2008.  The firm’s traders lost money on 22 days in the fourth
quarter, down from 31 in the third quarter, the New York-based
company said yesterday in a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The bank made more than $100 million on 26
days in 2011.  Morgan Stanley had the only growth in 2011 trading revenue
among the nine largest U.S. and European investment banks,
excluding accounting gains, as it posted a 7 percent increase to
$12.3 billion. Total trading revenue at those firms fell 16
percent as activity dropped amid  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, said
in a filing Feb. 24 that it recorded trading losses on 54 days
in 2011, including one day when losses exceeded $180 million.
 Bank of America Corp. , the second-largest U.S. lender, said in a
Feb. 23 filing that it had losses on 14 percent of trading days,
including 12 in which losses exceeded $25 million.  Morgan Stanley said that as of Dec. 31 counterparties may
call $4.74 billion in additional collateral or termination
payments if its  credit rating  is cut three levels, and it would
have to post $1.78 billion in collateral to certain exchanges
and clearinghouses. The combined figures for one- and two-level
downgrades were $1.04 billion and $5.17 billion, respectively,
according to the filing.  Credit Ratings  The firm previously had only disclosed requirements for
one- and two-level downgrades.  Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s credit ratings
may be cut by as many as three levels as part of a review of 17
banks and securities firms with global capital-markets
operations, Moody’s Investors Service said earlier this month.  Morgan Stanley also said it had about $700 million in
losses on fair-value loans and lending commitments. It raised
the amount of loans and commitments that it accounted for as
“held for investment,” or HFI, to $9.7 billion in the fourth
quarter from $800 million a year earlier, the company said last
month. That accounting would allow it to avoid booking losses on
some lending that drops in value.  A lawsuit over mortgage-backed securities issued by
 Countrywide Financial Corp. (CFC)  includes allegations that offering
documents contained false statements, and Morgan Stanley
underwrote about $6.3 billion of the offerings, according to
yesterday’s filing. Defendants in the case have moved to stay
the case pending resolution of a separate lawsuit brought by the
same plaintiffs, Morgan Stanley said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
