Fortuna Entertainment Group NV (FORTUNA)  fell
for a fifth day, headed for its longest losing streak since
August, after a newspaper report showed the market share for the
Czech bookmaker’s lottery unit trailed expectations.  The stock slid 0.7 percent to 97.3 koruna as of 11:55 a.m.
in Prague, headed for its lowest close in five weeks and the
longest slump since a five-day rout ended on Aug. 8.  Fortuna’s share of the Czech lottery market was about 5
percent this month, compared with 94 percent for rival Sazka AS,
 Lidove Noviny  reported today, citing its own calculations. The
Loto unit, started last year, has attracted less than 25 million
koruna ($1.3 million) in bets this month, about a fourth of the
sum drawn by Sazka, according to the Czech newspaper.  “While the volume of placed bets at Sazka is still growing
significantly, Fortuna’s Loto is rather stagnating,” analysts
at J&T Banka AS in  Prague  led by Milan Vanicek wrote in a report
to clients today. “Revenues generated by Loto are therefore
lagging behind market and the management’s expectations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
