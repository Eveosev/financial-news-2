The euro may decline as much as 6
percent to $1.259 against the dollar should it fail to breach a
key resistance level, Societe Generale SA said, citing technical
indicators.  “We continue to think that the rise initiated at $1.2620
in January is corrective,” technical analysts Hugues Naka and
Fabien Manac’h in Paris wrote in a research note based on data
compiled by SocGen. The 17-nation common currency dropped to
$1.2624 on Jan. 13, the weakest level since August 2010.  The euro weakened 0.3 percent to $1.3404 at 11:28 a.m.
London time. It strengthened to $1.3487 on Feb. 24, the highest
since Dec. 5, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  “The upper end of the medium-term declining channel, which
comes in at $1.3570 this week, should cap the upside and force
euro-dollar to point back towards the intermediate downside
target of $1.2590/$1.2620,” the SocGen analysts wrote.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Support is where buy orders may be
grouped, and resistance is a level where sell orders may be
clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
