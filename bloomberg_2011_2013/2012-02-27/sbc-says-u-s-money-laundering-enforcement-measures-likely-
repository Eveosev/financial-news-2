HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Europe ’s largest
bank, said U.S. prosecutors are likely to take criminal or civil
enforcement measures involving the bank amid a money laundering
probe.  The bank has been sent subpoenas and other requests for
information by U.S. agencies including the  U.S. Department of
Justice  and the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations relating to the Bank Secrecy Act, London-based
HSBC said in a filing today.  “It is likely that there will be some form of formal
enforcement action, which may be criminal or civil in nature, in
respect of some or all of the ongoing investigations,” HSBC
said in the filing.  HSBC North America Holdings Inc. and a subsidiary,  HSBC
Bank USA , reached agreements in 2010 with the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board to
make changes to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, a U.S. law
that combats  money laundering . The bank in November said “it is
likely there could be some form of formal enforcement.”  “The change in disclosure reflects the fact that some form
of formal enforcement action is likely,” London-based spokesman
Brendan McNamara said by phone today. “We take compliance
matters extremely seriously.”  The bank said on Jan. 25 it would cooperate with the U.S.
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations probe and
repeated its support of efforts to combat money laundering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
