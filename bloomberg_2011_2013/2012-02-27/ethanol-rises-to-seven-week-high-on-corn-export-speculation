Ethanol futures rose to the highest
price in almost seven weeks in  Chicago  on concern that export
demand for corn will raise production costs.  Futures gained for a fourth day as corn, the primary
feedstock for U.S. ethanol, climbed on speculation  China  may
increase imports. One bushel of corn makes at least 2.75 gallons
of ethanol.  “Spot markets for corn continue to be tight,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “That’s really
what’s keeping things afloat.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery advanced 0.3 cent to
$2.239 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest level
since Jan. 11. Prices are up 1.6 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  lost 1 cent to
$2.27 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf slipped 1 cent to $2.245,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast declined 1.5 cents to $2.29 a
gallon and in Chicago the additive rose 0.5 cent to $2.185.  Corn futures for May delivery gained 4.5 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $6.485 a bushel in Chicago, the fourth straight
gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
