Copper futures rose to a two-week
high as pending sales of previously owned U.S. homes rose more
than forecast, bolstering prospects for metal demand.  The index of pending home resales climbed 2 percent in
January, the National Association of Realtors said. That topped
the 1 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
economists.  Equities (SPX)  erased declines after the report. The
Copper Development Association says that builders account for
more than 40 percent of the metal’s use.  “The housing data was a positive, and copper is moving in
lockstep with equities and other risk assets,”  Matthew Zeman , a
strategist at Kingsview Financial in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. “It shows that the ‘risk-on’ appetite
remains very high.”  Copper futures for May delivery rose 0.5 percent to settle
at $3.889 a pound at 1:06 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Earlier, the price reached $3.8965, the highest for a most-
active contract since Feb. 13. Last week, the metal climbed 4.1
percent.  Earlier, copper declined as much as 1 percent on concern
that  Europe ’s debt crisis threatens global growth and commodity
demand. The Group of 20 nations rejected calls from the euro
area to increase the International Monetary Fund’s international
lending resources.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 0.1 percent to $8,536 metric ton ($3.87 a pound).  Aluminum, zinc and lead rose in London. Nickel and tin
dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
