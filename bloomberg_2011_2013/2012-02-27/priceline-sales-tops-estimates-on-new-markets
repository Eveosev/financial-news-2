Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN) , the biggest U.S.
online travel agency by market value, reached the highest in
more than a decade after fourth-quarter profit and sales beat
analysts’ estimates.  Priceline gained $41.22, or 7 percent, to $632.76 at 4 p.m.
in  New York . That’s the highest closing price since July 1999,
four months after Priceline’s initial public offering.  The company has weathered the European debt crisis better
than  Expedia Inc. (EXPE)  and  Orbitz Worldwide Inc. (OWW) , and it’s expanding
into  emerging markets  and new businesses such as car rentals.
The number of countries Priceline serves has jumped more than 60
percent in the past year to more than 160.  “They’re seeing accelerating growth in Europe despite the
macro issues that are in place,” said Mike Olson, an analyst at
Piper Jaffray Cos. in  Minneapolis . He recommends buying the
Norwalk, Connecticut-based company’s shares, which he doesn’t
own personally. “They’re trying to position themselves for the
continued offline-to-online transition in travel bookings in
emerging markets.”  Excluding some items, profit was $5.37 a share in the
period, the company said in a  statement .  Analysts had projected 
$5.06 on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
climbed 35 percent to $990.8 million, topping the $973.3 million
estimate.  Profit Forecast  First-quarter profit will be $3.80 to $3.90 a share,
excluding some items, Priceline said. That beat the $3.71
average estimate. Sales will rise 22 percent to 27 percent.
Analysts had predicted a 25 percent gain to $1.02 billion.  Net income in the fourth quarter rose to $225.7 million, or
$4.41 a share, from $135.7 million, or $2.66, a year earlier.  The biggest source of growth at Priceline is Booking.com,
the Amsterdam-based European unit that the company acquired in
2005. More than 60 percent of Priceline’s revenue comes from
overseas, predominantly  Europe . International bookings in the
quarter jumped 66 percent to $3.91 billion, helped by Agoda.com,
the Bangkok-based company Priceline  bought  in 2007. U.S.
bookings rose 16 percent to $1.04 billion.  Priceline’s competitors haven’t fared as well. Earlier this
month Expedia posted fourth-quarter revenue of $787.1 million,
almost $30 million less than analysts had estimated. Sales at
Orbitz dropped 2.9 percent in the period to $177.1 million, and
the company cited a “weaker overall travel market,” because of
conditions in Europe.  Car Rentals  To expand beyond hotels and airlines, Priceline acquired
car-rental company TravelJigsaw Ltd. in 2010. The company said
that global rental car days rose 34 percent from a year earlier.  “Our aim is to continue building our strength in new
markets, gain share in core markets, and pursue innovation,
which we believe will allow us to build on our leadership
position as the markets change,” Chief Executive Officer
Jeffery Boyd said in the conference call. Thailand,  Hong Kong 
and  Singapore  have emerged as strong markets, he said.  Last month, Priceline “killed off” William Shatner’s
“Negotiator” character from its commercials, after using him
as a celebrity spokesman for 14 years. The company is shifting
its focus to a published-price hotel service, rather than the
name-your-own-price option promoted by the former Captain Kirk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
