The yen gained against 15 of its 16
major peers on speculation Japanese exporters were taking
advantage of recent declines to bring home overseas earnings.  Japan ’s currency climbed for a second day versus the
dollar, its first back-to-back gain in two weeks, as traders bet
that the yen’s drop to a nine-month low yesterday was too rapid.
The 17-nation euro advanced against the greenback before the
 European Central Bank  allots a second round of unlimited three-
year funds tomorrow to help shore up the region’s banks.  “There’s talk of month-end-related repatriation by
Japanese exporters,” said Lee Wai Tuck, a currency strategist
at Forecast Pte in  Singapore . “This seems to be pushing the yen
up.”  The yen advanced 0.4 percent to 80.29 per dollar as of 1:59
p.m. in Tokyo, adding to yesterday’s 0.7 percent gain. It fell
as low as 81.67 yesterday, the weakest since May 31. Japan’s
currency climbed 0.1 percent to 107.89 per euro.  Europe ’s common
currency rose 0.3 percent to $1.3436.  The prospect that some Japanese companies and investors
will need to repatriate earnings by the end of the fiscal year
on March 31 may also be providing a spur to demand.  The dollar weakened against the yen as the greenback’s 14-
day relative strength index dipped to 67.8 today, having held
above 70 since Feb. 16. Some traders see RSI levels above 70 as
a sign an asset may reverse direction. The euro’s RSI versus the
yen stood at 71.1.  “The dollar and euro have risen too rapidly against the
yen,” said Junichi Ishikawa, an analyst in Tokyo at IG Markets
Securities Ltd. “Position adjusting, combined with a general
risk-off mood in the market, is likely to put upward pressure on
the yen.”  The Japanese currency has weakened 6.2 percent in the past
month, the worst performance among 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar has lost 1.3 percent and the euro has gained 0.4
percent over the same period, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
