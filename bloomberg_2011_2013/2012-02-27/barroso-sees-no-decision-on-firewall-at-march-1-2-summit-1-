European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said he expects “no decision” on financial firewalls
to be reached at a March 1-2 European Union summit.  With a parliamentary vote on a second Greek aid package
looming in Berlin today, German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government must now decide whether to back plans to combine
rescue funds and produce a potential firewall of 750 billion
euros ($1 trillion).  “It seems now that no decisions are going to be taken” at
the leaders’ meeting, Barroso said in Brussels today.  Europe 
needs ‘’stronger firewalls and much more flexible ones,” he
said.  Some argue that it would be better to postpone discussion
of the issue until after a Greek debt-swap deal with private
creditors has been completed, Barroso said. “March of course
has 31 days. During March this matter is going to be
addressed.”  Barroso called on “fast-growing economies that are
generating cash” to contribute more to the  International
Monetary Fund . “This is going in the right direction,” he
said.  “I’m looking for progress on this area until April,”
Barroso said. “That’s when it’s expected to take a decision.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
