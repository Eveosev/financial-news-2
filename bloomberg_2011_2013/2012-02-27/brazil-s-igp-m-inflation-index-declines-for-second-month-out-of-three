Economists covering  Brazil  increased
their 2013 inflation forecast to the highest on record after the
central bank reiterated it would continue cutting its benchmark
lending rate.  Brazil’s consumer prices will rise 5.11 percent next year,
according to the median forecast in a Feb. 24 central bank
survey of about 100 economists published today, up from the
previous week’s estimate of 5.02.  Policy makers have cut Brazil’s benchmark rate 200 basis
points since August to 10.5 percent to protect  Latin America ’s
biggest economy from  Europe ’s debt crisis and signaled that they
will probably lower the rate to a “single digit” in the near
future. Central bank President Alexandre Tombini reiterated on
Feb. 26 that the bank will continue to lower borrowing costs
further.  “Looser monetary policy in the context of stronger
economic activity leads to expectations for higher inflation
next year,”  Newton Rosa , chief economist for Sul America
Investimentos, said in a phone interview from  Sao Paulo .  Stronger economic growth, particularly in the second half
of the year when the effect of lower rates kicks in, “will push
prices up, and surveys are already taking that into account,”
Rosa said.  The yield on the interest rate future contract maturing in
January 2014, the most traded in Sao Paulo today, fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 9.76 percent at 9.44 a.m.
Brasilia time. The real declined 0.1 percent to 1.7115 per
dollar.  Lower Prices  The  IGP-M index  of wholesale, construction and consumer
prices declined 0.06 percent in February from January, its
second fall in three months, the Getulio Vargas Foundation said
on its website today. The median estimate from 29 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a fall of 0.08 percent. The index
had risen 0.25 percent in January.  The monthly decline was led by a 0.95 percent drop in raw
materials costs. The IGP-M rose 3.43 percent in the past 12
months, compared with a 4.53 percent jump in January.  Inflation expectations for 2012 remained unchanged at 5.24
percent, according to the central bank survey. The economy is
forecast to grow 3.3 percent this year and 4.1 percent next
year, the survey showed.  In a separate central bank survey on Feb. 23, economists
said Brazil’s 5.5 percent real  interest rate , the highest in the
Group of 20 nations, is too low for the country to meet its
inflation target.  Tombini has repeatedly pledged to slow consumer price
inflation to the 4.5 percent midpoint of the bank’s target range
by the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
