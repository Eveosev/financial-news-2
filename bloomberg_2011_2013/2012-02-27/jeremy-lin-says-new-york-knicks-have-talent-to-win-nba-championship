Jeremy Lin has led the  New York
Knicks  to a 9-3 record since taking over at point guard this
month and said his team has the talent to win the National
Basketball Association championship.  “Everyone’s goal is to win a championship,” Lin, who
participated in the Rising Stars Challenge during the NBA’s All-
Star weekend in Orlando,  Florida , told the  New York Post . “It’s
a very tough thing to do. I think we have the talent to do it. I
know we have the talent to do it.”  Lin, a Harvard University graduate who was cut by two other
teams before joining the Knicks, has averaged 23 points and 8.6
assists since getting his first shot at extended playing time on
Feb. 4. He came off the bench in that win and has started the
past 11 games at point guard.  New York enters the second half of the regular season with
a 17-18 record and is in second place behind the  Philadelphia
76ers  in the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division. The Knicks,
who were 8-15 before Lin sparked the recent run, are in seventh
place in the Eastern Conference, where the top eight teams will
make the postseason.  “This is a long process,” Lin said. “I need to make sure
I’m not getting complacent and that our team continues to climb.
And we want to be able to get into the top half of the East and
make a push in the playoffs.”  The Knicks start the season’s second half with a Feb. 29
home game against the  Cleveland Cavaliers  and then play road
games in  Boston , Dallas,  San Antonio  and Milwaukee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
