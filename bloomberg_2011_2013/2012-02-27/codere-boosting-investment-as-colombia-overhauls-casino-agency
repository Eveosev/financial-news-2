Codere SA (CDR) ,  Spain ’s only publicly
traded casino operator, will boost investment in  Colombia  this
year amid a government overhaul of industry regulation, said
Diego Felipe Navarro, the company’s top official in the country.  Codere will increase its investments in Colombia by as much
as 40 percent to about $21 million this year as it retools
marketing and plans for the May opening of the Zona T Crown
Casino in Bogota, to be Colombia’s biggest, Navarro said in an
interview.  “Colombia’s new regulator has an administrative structure
that will seek to promote gaming,” Navarro said from his office
in Bogota. “Confidence in Colombia is up.”  Colombia seeks to boost government revenue from gambling
fivefold in two years to 2 trillion pesos ($1.1 billion) as it
creates new agencies to promote and regulate the industry,
Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said in a statement in
November. Coljuegos, a state-run gaming business, will begin
operating as soon as next month, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
