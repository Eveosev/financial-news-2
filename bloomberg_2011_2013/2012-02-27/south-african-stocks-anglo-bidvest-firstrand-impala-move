The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH) 
declined for the first time in three days, falling 1.1 percent
to 33,871.32 by the close in Johannesburg. The gauge gained 0.5
percent last week.  The following were among the most active equities in the
South African market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the diversified miner that
makes up about 9 percent of the index, closed at the lowest in
more than a month, sliding 1.8 percent to 318.61 rand. Copper
declined on concerns that demand will remain muted after the
 International Monetary Fund  warned of a global slowdown in
economic growth and the Group of 20 nations rebuffed European
calls for assistance.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BIL)  , the world’s biggest mining
company, dropped 0.5 percent to 244.80 rand.  Calgro M3 Holdings Ltd. (CGR)  , a housing developer,
closed at the highest since its 2007 listing, jumping 2.6
percent to 4.30 rand. Earnings per share may rise more than 225
percent in the year to Feb. 29, the company said in a trading
update today.  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  ,  South Africa ’s second-largest
banking group, fell the most in more than four months, slipping
3.2 percent to 23.96 rand. The company’s 14-day  relative
strength index , which shows how rapidly prices advanced or
dropped during a specified time period, was 73 on Feb. 24, the
highest since Jan. 23. A reading of 70 or above may be a signal
to some investors who study technical charts that prices are set
to decline.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  , the second-largest
producer, retreated the most in more than a week, declining 2.7
percent to 163 rand. The company must transfer a 29.5 percent
stake in its Zimplats unit to a Zimbabwean government fund,
 Saviour Kasukuwere , the indigenization minister, said in a
letter addressed to the company obtained by Bloomberg News
today. Separately, the stock was cut to “equal-weight” from
“overweight” at RMB Morgan Stanley.  Mvelaserve Ltd. (MVS)  , the security and facilities
management company spun off from Mvelaphanda Group Ltd., gained
the most since its November 2010 listing, jumping 13 percent to
11.85 rand. BB Investment Co., a unit of Bidvest Ltd., bought
stock in Mvelaserve and now owns 5.16 percent of its shares, the
company said in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
