Robusta coffee production in
 Vietnam , the world’s largest grower, may decline as much as 20
percent next year after rains damaged flowers and as aging trees
trim output, the Vietnam Coffee & Cocoa Association said.  Rains in the Central Highlands during the flowering stage
hurt crop prospects and early blossoming coincided with the
harvesting of the 2011-2012 crop, the organization known as
Vicofa said on its  website  today. The number of trees older than
20 years, which are half as productive as young trees, will rise
to 30 percent of the total next year, it said.  “Due to abnormal weather developments, coffee trees have
been flowering during harvesting and continuous rains caused
difficulties for flowers to become fruits,” Vicofa said. “It
will have a negative impact on the yield and output from the
2012-2013 crop.”  Production will rise to 20.6 million bags in the 12 months
to Sept. 30 from 18.75 million a year earlier, a unit of the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said on Dec. 13. A bag weighs 60
kilograms (132 pounds). Vicofa did not forecast the output for
the 2012-2013 season.  A smaller crop in Vietnam may support a 13 percent rally in
robusta futures in  London  this year. The March-delivery robusta
contract fell 0.5 percent to $2,045 a ton on NYSE Liffe in
London at 5:25 p.m. Hanoi time. The most-active contract reached
$2,174 on Feb. 16, the highest intraday level since Sept. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
