Micron Technology Inc. (MU) , the largest
U.S. maker of computer-memory chips, rose the most in two months
after Japan-based rival  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665)  filed for bankruptcy.  Micron  advanced  7.7 percent to $8.56 at the close in New
York, for the biggest one-day percentage increase since Dec. 22.  Elpida, the last Japanese maker of dynamic random access
memory, or DRAM, chips, filed for bankruptcy after semiconductor
prices plunged and it failed to win a second government bailout.
While there’s too much capacity in the DRAM market, Micron could
acquire some of Elpida’s facilities and convert them to produce
Nand flash, the chips used in mobile phones and tablets,  Kevin Cassidy , a Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst, said.  “The biggest thing it does is signal to the market that
prices need to come up for DRAM,” Cassidy, a New York-based
analyst, said of Elpida’s bankruptcy filing. “PC manufacturers
have been benefiting from the DRAM industry selling below its
cost,” said Cassidy, who recommends  buying  Micron shares.  While Boise, Idaho-based Micron doesn’t need to acquire any
of Elpida’s assets, Nand flash presents a “higher growth”
opportunity, he said in a telephone interview today.  Dan Francisco, a Micron spokesman, said the company doesn’t
comment on market rumors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
