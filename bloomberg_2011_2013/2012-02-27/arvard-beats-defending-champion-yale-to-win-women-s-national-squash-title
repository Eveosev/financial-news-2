Harvard University  won the women’s
squash team national title yesterday, defeating Ivy League rival
and defending-champion Yale University 8-1.  The top-ranked Crimson, which finished the season with the
Ivy League title and a 17-0 record, took a 2-1 lead after the
first group of matches, and won the remaining six for its second
 College Squash Association  team championship in the past three
years.  The national title at the Murr Center in  Boston , a rematch
of last year’s championship, is the 13th in the history of the
Harvard program. The No. 2 Bulldogs finished the season 17-2,
with both losses coming to the Crimson.  “On paper, we have always been the team to beat, and we
just had to come and meet our potential,” Harvard senior co-
captain  Cece Cortes , whose victory clinched the title, told the
 Harvard Crimson , the school’s student newspaper. “It was really
a team effort.”  Harvard went 26-1 in its three matches in the CSA team
tournament this weekend, defeating No. 8  Dartmouth College  9-0
and No. 5  Trinity College  9-0 before facing Yale.  The CSA Individual Championships are held March 2-4 at
Amherst,  Massachusetts , where Yale sophomore Millie Tomlinson
will attempt to defend her title. Tomlinson lost to undefeated
Harvard freshman Amanda Sobhy, 11-1, 11-3, 11-1, yesterday in
the No. 1 match.  To contact the reporter on this story:
