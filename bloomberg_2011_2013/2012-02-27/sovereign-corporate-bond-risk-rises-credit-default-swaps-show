The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments climbed two basis points to 346.5 at 8:15 a.m. in
London. An increase signals deterioration in perceptions of
 credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 7.5
basis points to 582.5, according to BNP Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose two basis points to 132 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased 1.5 basis points to 214.5 and
the subordinated index rose five to 365.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
