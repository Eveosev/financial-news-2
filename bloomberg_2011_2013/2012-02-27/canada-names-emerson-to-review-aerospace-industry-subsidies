Canada’s federal government is
reviewing its financial support for the nation’s $22 billion
 aerospace industry , naming former industry minister David Emerson to lead the process.  Emerson, also a former  Canfor Corp. (CFP)  chief executive
officer, will be chairman of a panel seeking to “produce
concrete, fiscally-neutral recommendations on how federal
policies and programs can help maximize the competitiveness of
Canada’s aerospace and space sectors,” the government said in a
statement today. The panel will submit a report to Industry
Minister Christian Paradis by December, the government said.  The review may affect support for companies such as
Montreal-based planemaker Bombardier Inc. The global supply
chain, technology and market environment for the aerospace and
space industries are changing rapidly, the government said.  Emerson, 66, also served as  Canada ’s foreign-affairs and
trade minister before retiring from politics in 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
