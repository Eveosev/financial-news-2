Russian stocks  fell as the European
debt crisis outweighed oil trading near its highest in nine
months and after Moody’s Investors Service said Greek default
risk remains high.  The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  declined 0.1 percent to 1,592.66
at the close in Moscow, paring an earlier loss of as much as 0.6
percent.  OAO Novatek (NOTK) ,  Russia ’s second-biggest natural gas
producer, slipped 1.4 percent.  OAO Aeroflot (AFLT) , the nation’s
largest airline, lost 2.1 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS
Index advanced 0.4 percent to 1,728.13.  Stocks extended losses after Moody’s Investors Service said
Greek default risk remains high. The world economy is “not out
of the danger zone” amid fragile financial systems, high public
and private debt and rising oil prices, IMF Managing Director
 Christine Lagarde  said this weekend. Oil has advanced 11 percent
this year amid concern sanctions against  Iran’s nuclear program 
will disrupt crude supplies from the second-biggest producer in
the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries.  “While current oil prices are providing support for
Russian markets, they soon will be considered a global economic
problem,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at Troika Dialog,
wrote in an e-mailed report today. “Thus, the time that the oil
price will actually support markets will be fairly limited, so
Russia should make the most of it for the time being.”  Oil, Russia’s main export revenue earner, fell 1 percent to
$108.7 a barrel in  New York . The contract gained 1.8 percent to
$109.77 on Feb. 24, the highest close since May 3. Prices
increased 6.3 percent last week.  Sberbank Rises  German lawmakers vote on a second Greek rescue package
today.  Europe ’s biggest economy is also weighing whether to beef
up the region’s financial backstop to 750 billion euros ($1
trillion) at a March 1-2 European summit.  OAO Sberbank (SBER) , the country’s largest lender, rose 0.5
percent after the rouble strengthened against the dollar. A
stronger ruble may discourage Russians from withdrawing and
converting local-currency deposits, Sberbank’s main source of
funding. Sberbank climbed to 99.54 rubles, its highest since
August.  Sberbank may start preparing the central bank to sell a 7.6
percent stake when its share price approaches 100 rubles, Chief
Executive Officer  German Gref  said in comments broadcast on
state television on Oct. 28. Sberbank, Europe’s third-largest by
market value, is 60 percent owned by the government.  VTB Group, Russia’s second-largest bank, jumped 1.3 percent
to 7.31 kopeks. Potash producer OAO  Uralkali (URKA)  slid 0.8 percent.  The Micex is up 14 percent this year and trades at 6.2
times analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies. The
gauge retreated 17 percent in 2011, compared with an 18 percent
drop for  Brazil ’s Bovespa index, which is valued at 10.5 times
estimated earnings according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Shanghai Composite Index trades at 9.6 times estimated earnings,
and the BSE India Sensitive Index has a ratio of 15.7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
