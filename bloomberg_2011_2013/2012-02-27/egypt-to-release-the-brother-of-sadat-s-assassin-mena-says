Egypt  started procedures to release
the brother of the assassin of former President  Anwar Sadat  on
health grounds, the state-run  news agency  reported today.  A military court made the decision after Mohammed Shawky
el-Islambouli, the brother of Khaled el-Islambouli, had a
“health crisis” during a court hearing yesterday, the Cairo-
based Middle East News Agency said. He was arrested last year
upon arrival at Cairo International Airport and has appealed a
death sentence against him, it said.  Mohamed Shawky el-Islambouli has been released from his
prison and transferred to Cairo’s security directorate “to
finish his release procedures,” MENA said, citing an
unidentified security official. Sadat was assassinated in 1981
and succeeded as president by  Hosni Mubarak .  Editor: Digby Lidstone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
