India’s rupee snapped a three-day
gain on speculation a rally in  oil prices  will spur inflation
and threaten efforts to boost economic growth.  Crude oil for April delivery traded at $108.55 a barrel in
 New York  and has gained 10 percent this month. Wholesale prices
rose 6.55 percent in January from a year earlier from 7.47
percent in December, official data show. The current-account
deficit will widen to 3 percent of gross domestic product in the
year ending March 31, Chakravarthy Rangarajan, chairman of the
Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, said last week. That
compares with 2.6 percent the previous year.  “Oil prices will pressure the rupee both on the inflation
front as well as because of the country’s current-account
deficit,” said Sailesh K. Jha, Singapore-based head of Asia
markets strategy at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB. “I don’t
see any room for repurchase-rate cuts.”  The rupee declined 0.6 percent to 49.2350 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The currency’s losses could be limited as overseas
investors buy the nation’s bonds ahead of a month-end deadline,
according to Alpari Financial Services. The Securities &
Exchange Board of  India  auctioned $5 billion of corporate debt-
purchase quotas on Nov. 30 to foreigners, who must utilize the
allocations by Feb. 28 or let them expire.  Three-month onshore rupee forward contracts traded at 50.31
a dollar, compared with 50.06 on Feb. 24, while offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 50.36 from 50.09. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
