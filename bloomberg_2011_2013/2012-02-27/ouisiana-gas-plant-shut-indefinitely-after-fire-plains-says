(Corrects spelling of spokesman’s last name in second and
third paragraphs of story published yesterday.)  Plains All American Pipeline LP (PAA) ’s
natural-gas processing plant near Eunice,  Louisiana , shut by a
fire late last week, will remain offline until repairs and an
investigation are completed, a company spokesman said.  One employee was injured in the Feb. 24 fire at the Basile
plant, which has the capacity to process 150 million cubic feet
a day. The so-called cryogenic processing facility extracts
liquefiable hydrocarbons from gas at extremely low temperatures
to maximize the recovery of those molecules, said Brad Leone,
communication manager for the company in Houson.  “The plant is down indefinitely pending an investigation
and repairs,” Leone said.  The fire and shutdown didn’t affect area gas producers,
operations at a nearby storage facility or third-party pipelines
and gas-processing facilities, according to the company.  The Basile plant straddles the Pine Prairie Energy Center
header system accessing liquefied natural gas imports and is
connected to pipelines serving the region, according to the
company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
