Lam Kwong Yu, a former independent
director at  Hong Kong  Aircraft Engineering Co., or Haeco, was
convicted of insider dealing at a court in Hong Kong today, the
Securities and Futures Commission said in a press release.  Lam bought shares on June 4, 2010, after being told by
Haeco’s chief executive officer that the board was to meet that
day to discuss a proposed share purchase and buyout offer by
parent  Swire Pacific Ltd. (19)  at a premium to the market price, the
SFC said today.  The Eastern Magistracy sentenced Lam to five months in
prison, suspended for two years, and a fine of HK$50,000, the
Hong Kong markets regulator said in the release. Lam was also
ordered to pay the SFC’s investigation costs, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
