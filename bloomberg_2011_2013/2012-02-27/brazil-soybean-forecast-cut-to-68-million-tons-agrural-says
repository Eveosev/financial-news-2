     Feb. 27 (Bloomberg) --Soybean output in  Brazil , the world’s
second-largest producer after the U.S., will drop more than
expected after a drought reduced yields in the country’s south,
crop research firm AgRural Commodities Agricolas said.  Production will decline to 68 million metric tons in the
crop year that started Sept. 1, less than the 70.2 million tons
estimated on Jan. 23. That compares with a record 75.3 million
tons in the previous crop year, AgRural said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Growers have harvested 28 percent of the current crop as of
Feb. 24, up from 15 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
