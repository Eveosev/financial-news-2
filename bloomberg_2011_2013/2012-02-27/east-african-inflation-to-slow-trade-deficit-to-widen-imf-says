Inflation in  East Africa  may slow
this year as food prices ease, while rising oil costs will
probably boost imports and widen trade deficits, the
International Monetary Fund said.  Governments in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi
must keep spending in check as European donors curb funding for
budgets, IMF Deputy Managing Director Naoyuki Shinohara said at
a conference today in Arusha, Tanzania.  Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda have pushed up  interest rates 
since last year to curb inflation after the worst drought in 60
years fueled food prices. While the impact of drought has eased
this year, the price of Brent crude has surged 16 percent in
London since the beginning of the year, adding to import costs.  “Continued high oil prices and the risk of softening
commodity markets may lead to widening trade deficits,”
Shinohara said.  Growth in sub-Saharan  Africa ’s economy will probably
accelerate to 5.5 percent this year from 4.9 percent in 2011,
the IMF said on Jan. 24. Shinohara said today the growth rate
will be “close to” last year’s.  Foreign direct investment in the East African region
doubled to $1.7 billion over the past decade, Shinohara said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
