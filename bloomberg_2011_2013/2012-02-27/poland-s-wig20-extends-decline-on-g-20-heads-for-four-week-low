Poland’s benchmark  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  is on
track to close at a four-week low as European stocks retreated
after the Group of 20 nations rebuffed calls from the euro area
to boost the International Monetary Fund’s resources.  WIG20 Index lost as much as 1 percent to 2,288.23, the
lowest level since Jan. 30 and traded 0.7 percent lower at 11:40
a.m. in Warsaw.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  declined 0.8 percent
to 262.67, extending last week’s 0.4 percent retreat.  TVN SA (TVN) , Poland’s biggest television network and  Bank
Handlowy w Warszawie SA , a unit of Citigroup Inc. were among the
biggest stock laggers. TVN lost 3 percent to 10.91 zloty and
Bank Handlowy fell 2.1 percent to 76.5 zloty.  G-20 officials told the euro region’s political leaders to
provide more financial firepower before they consider lending
outside support, putting the onus on  Germany , already the
biggest national contributor to the bailouts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
