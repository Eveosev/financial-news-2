The amount of shares traded on the
 Zimbabwe  Stock Exchange in January rose to the highest level
since July 2009 even as market capitalization fell, according to
the  African Development Bank .  A total of 383.2 million shares valued at $55.8 million
were exchanged on the Harare-based exchange in the month, while
market capitalization declined to $3.5 billion from $3.7 billion
a month earlier, the bank said in its  Monthly Economic Review
for Zimbabwe .  The trades showed a “marked improvement in the average
price of shares,” the AfDB said.  About 80 companies are listed on the Zimbabwe Stock
Exchange. The ZSE didn’t answer calls when Bloomberg sought
comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
