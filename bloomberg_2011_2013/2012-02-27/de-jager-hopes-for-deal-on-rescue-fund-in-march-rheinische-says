Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager would like to reach an agreement on a plan to combine
rescue funds and produce a potential aid package of 750 billion
euros ($1 trillion) in March,  Rheinische Post  reported, citing
an interview with de Jager. .  De Jager added that “we need to ensure stability with
appropriate means” and that  Germany  now has to take a decision,
the newspaper reported.  Germany’s parliament approved the second Greek aid package
in Berlin today after the close of equity markets. The
government must decide whether to back plans at a March 1-2
European Union summit to combine rescue funds for the euro area
and produce a potential firewall of 750 billion euros.  -- Editor: James Kraus  To contact the reporter on this story:
