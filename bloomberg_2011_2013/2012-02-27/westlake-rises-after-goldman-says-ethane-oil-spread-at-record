Westlake Chemical Corp. (WLK)  rose the
most in six weeks after  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said a record
spread between oil and ethane will boost the plastics maker’s
earnings more than analysts’ estimate.  Westlake, based in Houston, rose 5.9 percent to $61.04 at
the close in New York, the biggest gain since Jan. 12.  “Consensus estimates are failing to give Westlake enough
credit for the recent drop in ethane and the rise in oil
prices,” Brian Maguire, a Houston-based analyst at Goldman,
said in a report yesterday. “We expect Westlake’s first half
EPS to substantially exceed current expectations.”  The price of Brent crude rose to a record 3.4 times U.S.
Gulf Coast ethane on an energy-equivalent basis, said Maguire.
Rising U.S. shale-gas output has depressed ethane prices,
lowering Westlake’s costs to make plastics. Resin prices are
poised to climb because of higher production costs in Europe and
Asia, where oil-derived naphtha is the main feedstock,  Maguire
said.  Westlake, which offered to buy vinyls maker  Georgia Gulf
Corp (GGC)  for $1.2 billion, gets the biggest earnings benefit from
the widening spread between ethane and oil, outpacing larger
rivals  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  and  LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) ,
Maguire said. Westlake may earn $7 a share this year, 32 percent
more than analysts’ estimate on average, he said.  Maguire, who rates the shares “buy,” added Westlake to
Goldman’s “Conviction” Buy List.  To contact the reporter on this story:
