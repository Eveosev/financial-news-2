(Corrects list of sold assets in last paragraph of story
published yesterday.)  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest
bank by market value, said full-year profit rose by 27 percent,
meeting analyst estimates, boosted by an accounting gain on the
revaluation of its own debt.  Net income rose to $16.8 billion in 2011 from $13.2 billion
in the year-earlier period, the London-based lender said in a
statement today. That compared with the $16.5 billion median
estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank had a
$4.16 billion gain on the value of its own debt.  “A substantial amount has been achieved during 2011, but
this will be a long journey with significant headwinds, so we
are increasing the intensity of execution in 2012,” Chief
Executive Officer  Stuart Gulliver , 52, said in the statement.  HSBC is cutting costs and withdrawing from less profitable
markets after setting aside more than $65 billion for souring
loans in  North America . The bank in August said it would
eliminate 30,000 jobs to cut $3.5 billion of costs over the next
two years, as investment banking revenue shrinks.  Costs as a proportion of revenue climbed to 57.5 percent
from 55.2 percent, the lender said today. That’s more than the
48 percent to 52 percent target range set by HSBC. Return on
equity, a measure of profitability, rose to 10.9 percent from
9.5 percent last year, still short of the lender’s target range
of 12 percent to 15 percent.  Investment Banking Profit  The shares were unchanged at 574.9 pence as of 8:29 a.m. in
 London  trading. Before today, the stock had declined 19 percent
over the past 12 months. The Bloomberg Europe Banks and
Financial Services index has declined 28 percent in the period.  Profit at HSBC’s investment banking division, led by Samir Assaf, fell 24 percent to $7 billion. That compares with a 32
percent drop to 2.97 billion pounds at Barclays Plc’s securities
unit in the same period.  Pretax profit from commercial banking rose 31 percent to
$7.9 billion, while income from retail banking and wealth
management advanced 11 percent to $4.3 billion, HSBC said.  The lender, which gains most of its profit from  Asia , has
announced $4.89 billion of asset sales since May, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. HSBC has sold units in Japan and
 Thailand . In January, it agreed to sell operations in  Costa
Rica , El Salvador and  Honduras  to Colombia’s Banco Davivienda SA
for $801 million to focus on bigger markets in  Latin America .  To contact the reporter on this story:
