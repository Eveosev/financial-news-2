Gasoline and heating oil fell for
the first time in five days on speculation that the European
debt crisis may persist, slowing global economic growth and
reducing fuel demand.  Futures slipped as the Group of 20 nations refused to raise
international lending for  Europe  to fight its debt crisis,
saying that a European review of its financial firewall in March
is “essential” before any decision could be made to boost
resources for the  International Monetary Fund . IMF Managing
Director Christine LaGarde said the world economy “is not out
of the danger zone.”  “The G-20 is talking about the risk of a global slowdown
and Christine LaGarde’s comments raised concerns about a slowing
global economy,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at
PFGBest in Chicago.  Gasoline for March delivery fell 2.45 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $3.1283 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices have surged 16 percent this year.  March-delivery heating oil declined 2.95 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $3.2864 a gallon on the exchange. Prices
have risen 12 percent so far in 2012.  “People are concerned these higher prices are going to
slow down the economy,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1
cent to $3.698 yesterday, according to AAA data. Prices, which
have risen 13 percent this year, were 10 percent higher than a
year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
