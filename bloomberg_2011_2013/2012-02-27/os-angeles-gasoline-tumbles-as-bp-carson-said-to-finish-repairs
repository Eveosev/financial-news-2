California-blend gasoline in  San
Francisco  and Los Angeles weakened against futures after  BP Plc (BP/) 
was said to finish repairs on the hydrocracker at the Carson oil
refinery in Southern California.  London-based BP finished repairing a leaking flange
associated with the hydrocracker at the 266,000-barrel-a-day
 Carson (BPCRCRUD)  plant, Californiaâ€™s second-largest refinery, a person
with direct knowledge of the work said today. The gasoline-
making unit should be back to normal production within a few
days, the person said.  Carbob in  Los Angeles (MOGLDB85)  dropped 8 cents to a premium of 33.5
cents a gallon against futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 5:16 p.m. East Coast time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The same fuel in  San Francisco (MOGSD85P)  tumbled
10.5 cents to 28 cents above futures.  Los Angeles  Carbob rose 10.5 cents on Feb. 23 and Feb. 24
after BP was said to discover the leak at the Carson refinery.
 Scott Dean , a BP spokesman in Warrenville, Illinois, declined to
comment on operations at the plant.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland (MOGHD87P) ,  Oregon ,
weakened 3.5 cents to a premium of 19.5 cents against gasoline
futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
