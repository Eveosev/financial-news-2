INA  Industrija Nafte d.d., a
Croatian refiner controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt., said it is
pulling out of  Syria , following the Croatian government’s Feb.
23 decree to abide by an EU embargo on the Middle Eastern
country.  The Zagreb-based company yesterday informed the General
Petroleum Co. of Syria that it its temporarily suspending all
business activities in their joint venture natural gas and crude
oil facilities until further notice, INA said in an e-mailed
statement, citing “force majeure.”  “Based on the Croatian government decision, as well as the
overall security situation in Syria, INA is not able to continue
performing its regular business operations and activities in
Syria due to reasons which are beyond the control of the
company,” INA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
