The Australian dollar reached a one-
week high against its U.S. counterpart before the  European
Central Bank  begins its longer-term refinancing operation today
to help shore up the region’s banks.  The Aussie advanced as global stocks rose, supporting
demand for higher-yielding assets. New Zealand’s currency,
nicknamed the  kiwi , pared earlier losses.  “Wait for the LTRO and the boost to risk markets and use
that as an opportunity to sell into strength,” said  Robert Rennie , chief currency strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in
Sydney. “Dips in the Aussie back to the $1.06 to 1.0650 level
are being well-supported. The buyers are out there looking for
opportunities to buy.”  Australia’s dollar rose 0.1 percent to $1.0767 at 11:38
a.m. in  New York  after earlier climbing to $1.0787, the
strongest since Feb. 20. The Aussie was little changed at 86.67
yen after earlier losing as much as 0.7 percent.  New Zealand ’s
currency fell 0.4 percent to 83.74 U.S. cents after earlier
dropping as much as 0.7 percent. The kiwi decreased 0.5 percent
to 67.45 yen.  The MSCI World Index of equities rose 0.5 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.4 percent.  Europe’s central bank will call for bids today in the
tender of unlimited three-year funds and will announce the
allotment amount tomorrow. Financial institutions may ask the
ECB for 470 billion euros ($632 billion) in funds, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Purchasing power parity, a measure of relative consumer
prices across countries, shows the Aussie is trading 35 percent
above fair value against the  U.S. dollar . The kiwi is 31 percent
overvalued versus the greenback.  To contact the reporter on this story:
