(Corrects third paragraph of story published Feb. 27 to
show that Glencore only stated its intention to notify
Commission and the date on which it announced this.)  Xstrata Plc (XTA) , the worldâ€™s largest
exporter of thermal coal, received unanimous consent from
lenders to waive a so-called change-of-control provision on its
$6 billion revolving credit facility.  The company successfully petitioned banks to waive the
condition that would have mandated the loan be refinanced if a
proposed merger with  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  were completed,
Claire Divver, a spokeswoman for the Zug, Switzerland-based coal
producer, said today by phone. The facility can now remain in
place until the deal is done, allowing Xstrata to refinance debt
as a larger entity if combined with Glencore.  The revolving credit will also function as a backstop to
ensure the company has sufficient liquidity and working capital
for the next 18 months, Divver said. Glencore announced on Feb.
24 its intention to formally notify the European Commission
about the deal, seeking approval under regional merger
regulations.  Glencore is working with Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley
as financial advisers on the merger, while Xstrata has hired
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG
and Nomura Bank International Plc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
