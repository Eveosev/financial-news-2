Germany ’s opposition leader Frank- Walter Steinmeier said the lack of an absolute majority in a
vote on Greek aid shows Chancellor Angel Merkel’s authority is
“severely damaged,”  Tagesspiegel  reported, citing an
interview.  Merkel won approval for a second Greek bailout in
parliament even as 17 of her coalition’s lawmakers voted against
the aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
