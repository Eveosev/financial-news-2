Royal Ahold NV (AH) , the Dutch owner of
Stop & Shop stores, plans to acquire online retailer Bol.com for
350 million euros ($470 million) to boost  Internet sales .  Bol.com, with 3.4 million active customers and net sales of
355 million euros last year, is being bought from  NPM Capital (NPMC)  NV
and Cyrte Investments, Amsterdam-based Ahold said today in a
statement. The online retailer offers products including books,
entertainment, electronics and toys.  The acquisition brings “the platform, scale and expertise
we need to accelerate our growth in online retailing,” Chief
Executive Officer  Dick Boer  said in the statement.  Boer, who took the helm in March last year, wants to triple
online sales to 1.5 billion euros in the coming years, and to
expand the retailer’s geographic reach.  “This add-on deal makes it for us unlikely that Ahold will
look at much larger targets for daily consumables such as Hema
or Wehkamp,” said Patrick Roquas, a Utrecht-based analyst at
Rabobank Securities, who has a “buy” recommendation on Ahold.  Ahold’s Giant Food Stores agreed to acquire 16 Genuardi’s
stores from  Safeway Inc. (SWY)  for $106 million in January to expand
in the greater Philadelphia area.  The stock increased 0.1 percent at 10.32 euros in Amsterdam
trading, bringing Ahold’s market value to 11.36 billion euros.  “Bol.com has a proven track record of delivering double-
digit sales growth and attractive returns,” Ahold said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
