Bahrain , the smallest oil producer
in the Persian Gulf region, “improved” output last year at its
oldest field and boosted production at a deposit shared with
Saudi Arabia, Oil Minister Abdul Hussain Ali Mirza said.  Tatweer Petroleum Co., a joint venture between  Occidental
Petroleum Corp. (OXY) , Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Development Co. and
the state-owned National Oil & Gas Authority of Bahrain, is
responsible for a production improvement at the island kingdom’s
Bahrain field, Mirza said today in a statement. The minister
didn’t provide details about the amount of crude produced there.  The Abu Saafa field shared with neighboring Saudi Arabia
pumped a record 300,000 barrels a day in 2011, with Bahrain
receiving half of that amount, Mirza said. Bahrain produced 552
billion cubic tons of natural gas last year and plans to build a
sea port for liquefied gas, he said in the statement detailing
progress in energy output in 2011.  Bahrain, the first Gulf country to discover crude, is among
producers including  Saudi Arabia  and  Kuwait  that are seeking to
recover more oil and gas from their fields to satisfy higher
domestic demand and raise exports. Tatweer Chief Executive
Officer Adel Almoayyed said in a Sept. 28 interview that his
company was targeting an increase in production to 70,000
barrels a day by 2016 from the Bahrain field.  Occidental drilled a first oil-exploration well in
southwestern Bahrain last year and will drill an additional two
wells in 2012 as part of an agreement with the government, Mirza
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
