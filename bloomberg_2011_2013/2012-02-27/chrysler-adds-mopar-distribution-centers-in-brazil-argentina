Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker majority-owned by  Fiat (F)  SpA, said it opened Mopar
parts-distribution centers in Brazil and Argentina to support
its expansion in  emerging markets .  The Louveira, Sao Paulo, facility will distribute more than
20,000 parts to support 30 dealers and the General Rodriguez,
 Buenos Aires , center will provide more than 10,000 parts for
more than 25 dealer locations, Chrysler said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Chrysler, 58.5 percent owned by Turin, Italy-based Fiat,
said in December that it opened Mopar centers in Shanghai and
Dubai. Fiat obtained control of Auburn Hills, Michigan-based
Chrysler as part of the U.S. automaker’s government-backed
bankruptcy reorganization in 2009.  Under Fiat’s control, Chrysler is moving into markets
outside the U.S. Chrysler relies on its home market for vehicle
sales more than its U.S.-based competitors, General Motors Co.
and Ford Motor Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
