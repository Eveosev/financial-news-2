Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
there’s currently no need to increase the lending capacity of
 Europe ’s bailout mechanisms, citing lower borrowing costs for
indebted euro states.   “There’s no need now for a debate on increasing the
capacity” of the temporary and permanent bailout funds, Merkel
told lawmakers today as they prepared to vote on a 130 billion-
euro rescue package for Greece, the second in two years.   Merkel said euro leaders this week will discuss moving up
capital payments for the permanent fund, the European Stability
Mechanism, and that Germany is willing to pay in 11 billion
euros this year if other countries speed up payments as well.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
