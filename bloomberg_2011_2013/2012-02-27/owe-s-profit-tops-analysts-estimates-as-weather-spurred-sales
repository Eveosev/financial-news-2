Lowe’s Cos. (LOW) , the second-largest U.S.
home-improvement retailer, reported fourth-quarter profit that
exceeded analysts’ estimates after warmer weather encouraged
outdoor projects.  Net income in the quarter ended Feb. 3 rose 13 percent to
$322 million, or 26 cents a share, from $285 million, or 21
cents, a year earlier, the Mooresville, North Carolina-based
company said today in a statement. Excluding some items, profit
was 29 cents a share. Analysts projected 23 cents, the average
of 23  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey.  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Niblock  has equipped
employees with iPhones and added online merchandise to catch up
to larger rival  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  Lowe’s also benefited from the
fourth-warmest January on record and a drop in the  unemployment
rate  to a three-year low last month, helping sales at stores
open at least a year advance 3.4 percent in the quarter.  “Lowe’s reported a strong quarter aided in part by
weather,”  David Strasser , an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott
LLC in New York, wrote today in a note to clients. He recommends
buying the shares and said the results show “a company making
progress in its transition.”  Analysts had expected Lowe’s same-store sales to increase
1.1 percent, the average of seven estimates. Home Depot, based
in Atlanta, reported last week a 5.7 percent jump in comparable-
store sales in the fourth quarter.  Lowe’s fourth-quarter revenue rose 11 percent to $11.6
billion. The average estimate of 19 analysts was $11.3 billion.  Lowe’s gained 0.7 percent to $27.34 at the close in  New
York . The shares rose 1.2 percent last year.  Profit Forecast  Lowe’s said profit per share in the fiscal year ending Feb.
1, 2013, may be $1.75 to $1.85. Analysts estimated $1.80. The
retailer said comparable-store sales may rise 1 percent to 3
percent after they were essentially unchanged in 2012.  Store closings, discontinued projects and asset impairments
reduced profit in the fourth quarter by 3 cents a share. The
company said last year it would close 20 stores in October and
November and canceled plans for some new locations as part of
efforts to boost profit from existing stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
