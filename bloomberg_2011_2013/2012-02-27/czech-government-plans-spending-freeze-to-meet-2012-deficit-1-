The Czech government will propose a
package of tax increases and spending freezes to ensure it meets
its goal of reducing the size of the  budget deficit  in 2012,
Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek said.  The three-party coalition government may propose as much as
23.6 billion koruna ($1.2 billion) in spending freezes to ensure
the state meets its plan to reduce the deficit in 2012 as
economic growth slows, Kalousek told reporters today in Prague.  The government must save 42.2 billion koruna next year and
84.4 billion koruna in 2014, Kalousek said. New laws will be
introduced to curb the size of the deficit and the government
will propose freezing increases in pensions from 2013 until
2015, he said.  The government also plans to cancel some social benefits,
cut administration costs and making 20 percent the level of
value-added tax on most goods, Kalousek said.  The electricity tax would also be doubled, while the
government will introduce a carbon tax on heating oil and coal,
the minister said.  The personal income tax will raise to 16 percent from 15
percent and the Cabinet wants to introduce a temporary 31
percent tax on top earnings that would be raised to 32 percent
in 2014 and 2015, he said.  The government also proposes to lower deductible items for
the self-employed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
