Francois Hollande , the front runner
in France’s presidential race, said a victory of the Socialist
Party could provide an impulse for other majority changes in
Italy or  Germany  in coming elections.  “The change can exist,” Hollande said in an interview on
TF1 national television today. “It will be easier if I can show
the way with the help of French people.”  Hollande, who reiterated his promise to renegotiate the
European Union’s fiscal treaty, said the discussion with
“conservative” partners, including Germany, “will be
difficult.”  He repeated his call to include measures to spur growth in
the new treaty now under ratification across Europe.  “We need this treaty, but renegotiated, complete with a
growth dimension,” Hollande said, calling for a
“reorientation” of  Europe ’s economic measures.  France’s two-round presidential elections will be held in
April and May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
