London Mayor  Boris Johnson  pledged
to push through plans to automate the city’s Underground rail
network, doing away with the need for drivers, if he wins a
second term in May, the Evening Standard newspaper reported.  Johnson said in an  interview with the Standard  published
today that he’s prepared to take on rail unions that have
disrupted services on the Underground, known as the Tube, with
strikes. The Docklands Light Railway already runs driverless
trains.  “I don’t want to sound confrontational but if there’s
going to have to be a fight over this then I’m the person that
can do it,” Johnson told the newspaper. “The revenue that
comes into the DLR from automation, from making sure that you
don’t have personnel doing things that are unnecessary, greatly
exceeds the cost of running it. And you can use that revenue to
invest in new systems. I want to be the Mayor who delivers
that.”  Recent polls for the Standard have shown the race for mayor
between Johnson, a member of Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
Conservatives, and his Labour Party opponent, former Mayor  Ken Livingstone , is too close to call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
