South Korea  posted its first
current-account deficit in nearly two years as exports dropped
due to  Europe ’s debt crisis and the Lunar New Year holiday.  The deficit was $772.2 million in January, the first
shortfall since February 2010, compared with a revised surplus
of $2.8 billion in December, the  Bank of Korea  said in a
statement in  Seoul  today. The current account is the broadest
measure of trade, tracking goods, services and investment
income.  Signs of an improving U.S. economy and progress toward a
Greek bailout have cut external risks for  Asia ’s fourth-largest
economy while rising oil prices pose a fresh threat, Finance
Minister Bahk Jae Wan said last week. The Bank of  Korea  kept its
benchmark  interest  rate unchanged for an eighth month on Feb. 9,
the longest pause since tightening began in July 2010.  “Korea’s trade account should post a deficit in the first
quarter, suggesting negative GDP growth for the quarter,” Kwon Young Sun, a Hong Kong-based economist at Nomura Holdings Inc.,
said before the release. “But this should be temporary as we
expect a modest recovery in global demand in the second half.”  The won weakened 0.3 percent to close at 1,129.24 per
dollar in Seoul yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Kospi Index lost 1.4 percent.  The country posted a deficit of $1.4 billion on traded
goods after a revised surplus of $2.7 billion in December,
today’s report showed.  Exports Decline  Total exports on a customs-cleared basis fell to $41.4
billion in January from $47.7 billion in December, according to
today’s statement. Imports declined to $43.4 billion from $45.5
billion.  Overseas shipments may rise 17.5 percent in February from a
year ago, according to a median estimate of 12 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg ahead of a March 1 report on exports.  The BOK forecast in December that the economy will grow 3.7
percent in 2012 and 4.2 percent in 2013. The country’s current-
account surplus is expected to narrow to $13 billion this year
from $26.5 billion in 2011, according to the projections.  -- Editors: Iain Wilson, Brendan Murray  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
