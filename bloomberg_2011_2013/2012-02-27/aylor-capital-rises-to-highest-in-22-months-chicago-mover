  Taylor Capital Group Inc. (TAYC) , the
holding company for Chicago-based Cole Taylor Bank, climbed to
the highest in 22 months, extending a rally after returning to
profit last year.  The stock advanced 4 percent to $13.65 in New York. It last
closed at a higher price on April 27, 2010. The shares have
jumped 40 percent this year.  Taylor, which provides commercial-banking services to
closely held companies and their owners, said in January that
net income applicable to common stockholders amounted to $71.5
million in 2011, compared with a loss of $79.3 million the
previous year.  Bank stocks have advanced in 2012 amid optimism that the
 U.S. economy  is improving. The 24-company KBW Bank Index, which
includes firms larger than Taylor, has gained 14 percent since
the beginning of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
