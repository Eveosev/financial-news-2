CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest power utility in
the Czech Republic, gained for a second day before reporting
fourth-quarter earnings tomorrow and benchmark electricity
prices rose to a two-month high.  The stock climbed as much as 2.1 percent before paring the
gain to 0.9 percent at 823.4 koruna by 10:18 a.m. in Prague,
adding to a 0.2 percent advance yesterday. The countryâ€™s  PX (PX) 
gauge of 14 companies slid 0.1 percent.  Net income for October to December probably rose to 13.2
billion koruna ($706.2 million) from 6.9 billion a year earlier,
according to the median estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Power for next-year delivery in Germany, where CEZ
exports part of its output, climbed for a fifth day to 54.05
euros per megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
