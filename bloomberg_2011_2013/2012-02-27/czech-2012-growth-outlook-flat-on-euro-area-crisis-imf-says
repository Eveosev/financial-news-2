The outlook for growth in the  Czech
Republic  this year is “flat” as the euro-area debt crisis
curbs demand for the country’s exports, the  International
Monetary Fund  said.  The Czech Republic should craft long-term regulation to
enhance fiscal discipline while the central bank should adopt an
“easing bias” to help stimulate the economy, the IMF said
today in a report released at the end of its regular Article IV
consultations with policy makers.  Inflation will accelerate this year as a result of
increases in the value-added tax rates and then be in line with
the central bank’s target from 2013, Masanori Yoshida, IMF
mission chief, told a press conference today in Prague.  To contact the reporter on this story:
