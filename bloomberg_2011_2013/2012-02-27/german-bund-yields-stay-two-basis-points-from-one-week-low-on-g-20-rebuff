Italian two-year notes surged,
pushing the yield to the least in almost 11 months, as borrowing
costs fell at a sale of bills before the  European Central Bank ’s
second round of three-year loans to financial institutions.  Spanish two-year notes gained for an eighth day, their
longest run of advances since December. The ECB is due to
allocate banks unlimited cash in its second longer-term
refinancing operation in two days’ time.  Germany ’s  10-year bond
yields  slid to the lowest in more than a week as Moody’s
Investors Service said the risk of Greece defaulting is high and
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  said there is no quick solution to the
debt crisis.  “Italy is leading the way higher before the LTRO later
this week, people are thinking that there will be significant
take-up and that this will be parked in the front end of the
Italian and Spanish curves,” said  Richard McGuire , a strategist
at Rabobank International in London. “The positive sentiment
has also been aided by the successful bill auction.”  The Italian  two-year note yield  slid 15 basis points, or
0.15 percentage point, to 2.68 percent at 4:26 p.m. London time.
It reached 2.63 percent, the least since April 7. The 2.25
percent note due November 2013 gained 0.235 or 2.35 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,341) face amount, to 99.33 percent. Spain’s two-
year yield fell nine basis points to 2.51 percent.  Italian Auction  Italy’s Treasury auctioned 8.75 billion euros of 184-day
bills at 1.202 percent, the lowest yield since September 2010,
and down from 1.969 percent at the last auction of similar-
maturity securities on Jan. 27. Investors bid for 1.36 times the
amount offered, compared with 1.35 times last month. The
Treasury also sold 3.5 billion euros of 295-day bills at 1.29
percent.  Italy’s government note yields have dropped about 3.50
percentage points since the ECB announced its plan to offer
unlimited three-year loans on Dec. 8, amid speculation that
banks are buying the securities to use them for collateral with
the central bank.  Spain ’s two-year note yields have dropped 2.4
percentage points over the same period.  Using the operations, banks can borrow from the ECB at
around 1 percent and invest the proceeds in securities such as
the 10-year Italian government bond, currently yielding 5.43
percent.  Bank Loans  Banks took 489 billion euros at the first of the ECB’s
operations in December and will seek 470 billion euros on Feb.
29, according to the median estimate of 28 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “The ECB’s LTRO should improve sentiment, unless the
figure is lower than expected,” said Christian Reicherter, an
analyst at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt .  The Frankfurt-based ECB said today it hasn’t bought any
 government bonds  for two straight weeks. Purchases have dropped
since the ECB funneled cash into the banking system with the
three-year loans, reducing the need to intervene with its
Securities Markets Program.  The yield on the German 10-year bond fell six basis points
to 1.82 percent, after slipping to 1.81 percent, the least since
Feb. 2.  European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said today he
expects “no decision” to be reached during a March 1-2
European Union summit on whether to combine the region’s rescue
funds and produce a potential firewall of 750 billion euros.  G-20 Rebuff  “There’s no need now for a debate on increasing the
capacity” of the temporary and permanent bailout funds, Merkel
told lawmakers in Berlin today.  A European review of the arrangements is “essential”
before any consideration can be made to boost outside support to
aid the debt crisis, the Group of 20 nations said in a statement
yesterday after a meeting of finance ministers.  Greece ’s benchmark bond yields rose to a euro-era record
today after Moody’s Investors Service said the risk of the
nation defaulting “remains high.”  Europe ’s most-indebted nation formally asked investors to
exchange their holdings of government debt for new securities
last week as part of a new bailout deal. Greece’s central
government debt stood at 368 billion euros at the end of
December, compared with 360.4 billion euros at the end of
September, according to a statement posted on the Athens-based
Finance Ministry’s website on Feb. 24.  “The risk of a default even after this distressed exchange
is completed remains high,” Moody’s said in its weekly credit
outlook published today. There is still a chance that private-
sector creditors won’t agree to a debt swap, it said.  Greece’s October 2022 bond rate was 54 basis points higher
at 34.77 percent after reaching a euro-era record 36.52 percent,
according to Bloomberg generic data.  Greek bonds have handed investors a loss of 6.9 percent
this year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities have returned 2.3 percent in 2012, while Italian
bonds jumped 9.3 percent. German debt is little changed, after
rising 9.7 percent in 2011, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
