Serbiaâ€™s 2011 current-account
deficit widened 42.5 percent from the previous year as Serbs
abroad sent less money back home, the National Bank of Serbia
said.  The shortfall totaled 2.96 billion euros ($3.96 billion),
compared with 2.08 billion euros in 2010, the Belgrade-based
central bank said today in a statement on its website.
Remittances, one of the main sources of capital inflows, dropped
to 2.21 billion euros from 2.42 billion euros, it said.  Portfolio investment remained at 1.62 billion euros at the
end of December, almost unchanged from November. Portfolio
investment stood at 38.8 million euros in 2010.  The data showed 1.5 billion euros in foreign capital
inflows invested in government debt.  Serbia attracted 1.83 million euros in foreign direct
investment last year, compared with 860 million euros in 2010,
the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
