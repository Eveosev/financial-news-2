Lafarge SA (LG) , the French cement maker,
plans cost savings of more than 300 million euros ($403 million)
in 2013, Natixis reported, following a management presentation
to investors in  London .  “In the long term, Lafarge does not want to make a large-
scale acquisition but instead focus on organic growth by
expanding its capacity in emerging countries,” Rafic El Haddad
and colleagues at Paris-based bank Natixis wrote in a research
note today. Chief Executive OfficerBruno Lafont “intends to
concentrate on certain buoyant markets” including Algeria,
Brazil,  India , Russia and sub-Saharan countries, they wrote.  The company will sell at least 1 billion euros of assets
this year, halve its dividend and shrink capital expenditure by
400 million euros, the CEO said Feb. 17. Lafarge also aims to
reduce costs in 2012 by at least 400 million euros.  Lafont seeks to repair a  credit rating  that has fallen
below investment grade amid higher raw material prices.  Standard
& Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service cut the company’s credit
rating to “junk,” or lower than investment-grade, in 2011. A
spokeswoman for Lafarge said she couldn’t immediately comment.  Shares of Lafarge were down 0.6 percent at 35.18 euros at
11:47 a.m. in Paris trading. They have risen 29 percent this
year, giving it a market value of 10.1 billion euros.  Natixis has a “buy” recommendation on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
