Meridian Capital, an investment
company linked to Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev and
former Kazkommertsbank executives, controls 50 percent of
Novaport, which owns seven Russian airports,  Vedomosti  said.  Novaport’s announcement of the ownership change, made about
six years after the deal, may signal that a stake in the airport
holding company will be sold to third investor, the Moscow-based
newspaper said, citing Andrey Rozhkov, an analyst at IFC
Metropol.  The stake in Novaport may have cost $450 million, Vedomosti
said, citing an unidentified person at Aeon Corp., the parent
company of Novaport, which is owned by businessman Roman Trotsenko.  To contact the reporter on this story:
