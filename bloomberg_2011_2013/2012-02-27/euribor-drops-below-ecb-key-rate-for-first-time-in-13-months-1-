The  rate  at which European banks say
they see each other lending in euros for three months dropped to
less than the region’s key interest rate for the first time in
more than 13 months.  The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for such loans
dropped for a 48th day, falling 0.9 basis point, or 0.009
percentage point, to 0.997 percent, according to data from the
European Banking Federation. That’s the  lowest  rate since
January 2011 and is the longest run of declines since April
2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the first
time the rate has fallen below the  European Central Bank ’s  main
refinancing rate , currently 1 percent, since Jan. 13, 2011.  The rate has fallen every day since the ECB allotted a
record 489 billion euros ($657 billion) of three-year loans to
523 banks on Dec. 21 to keep credit flowing amid the region’s
sovereign debt crisis. The central bank plans to hold a second
longer-term refinancing operation for such loans tomorrow, with
full allocation a day later. Financial institutions may ask to
borrow 470 billion euros from the ECB, the median of 28
estimates in a Bloomberg survey showed.  “Euribor has declined since the LTRO as risk sentiment has
improved,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “The
operation removed concern that banks may have a liquidity issue.
Our view is for further falls in Euribor on a decent take-up in
this week’s LTRO.”  Tender Estimate  Analysts at Credit Agricole estimate demand at the tender
may rise to between 600 billion euros and 700 billion euros,
Green said.  Three-month Euribor may continue to slide, according to
futures contracts. The implied rate on the contract expiring in
June was little changed at 0.77 percent at 1:39 p.m. London
time. It fell to 0.845 percent on Feb. 1, the least for the
front Euribor futures contract since June 2010.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to lend to one
another reached the lowest level in almost six months today. A
lower reading signals a greater willingness to lend.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight indexed swaps was at 64.9
basis points, the lowest since Aug. 31. The spread has narrowed
since reaching 100.6 basis points on Dec. 1, the most since
February 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
