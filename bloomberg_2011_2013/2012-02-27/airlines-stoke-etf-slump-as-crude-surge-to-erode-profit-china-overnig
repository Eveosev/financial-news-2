Chinese stocks  traded in the U.S.
fell for the third time in five days and  the iShares FTSE China
25 Index Fund  plunged the most in two weeks, led by airlines on
concern rallying  oil prices  will eat into profit.  China Southern Airlines Co. (ZNH)  and  China Eastern Airlines Co. (CEA) ,
the nation’s second- and third-biggest carriers by market value,
tumbled in U.S. trading, pushing  the Bloomberg China-US 55 Index 
of Chinese stocks traded in  New York  down 0.7 percent to 106.75
yesterday. Hong Kong-listed stock of  Air China Ltd. (601111) , the largest
international carrier, dragged the iShares FTSE China 25, the
biggest ETF in the U.S., down by the most since Feb. 10.  Crude soared 6.3 percent last week to the highest price
since May, as escalating tension with  Iran  threatened supplies.
The rally spurred a 2.9 percent increase in  jet fuel  in the
week, with prices at a nine-month high in  Singapore  yesterday.
World Bank President Robert Zoellick also added to pressure on
Chinese equities, saying yesterday in Beijing that the Chinese
economy will probably have a “soft landing.”  “Margins get hit at transportation stocks including
airlines as jet fuel prices rose and they can’t raise prices by
the same amount,”  Dave Lutz , head of ETF trading and strategy
at Baltimore-based Stifel Nicolaus & Co. said by phone
yesterday.  China  will probably need to continue to “loosen
monetary policy,” to sustain its level of economic growth, Lutz
said.  The People’s Bank of China cut lenders’ reserve-requirement
ratios for the second time in three months on Feb. 24 to help
ease credit conditions in the world’s second-largest economy.
Policy makers have kept benchmark lending and deposit rates
unchanged since July.  Not Sustainable  Zoellick said China’s current economic-growth model isn’t
sustainable in a speech based on a report by the IMF and Chinese
state researchers. The nation needs to redefine the government’s
role, alter the structure of state enterprises and gradually
allow market-set  interest rates , according to the executive
summary.  Guangzhou, China-based China Southern released data on Feb.
16 that showed its load factor, a measure of occupancy, declined
3.7 percent in January from a year earlier, driven by a drop in
cargo loads.  American depositary receipts of China Southern sank 4.3
percent to $24.22 in New York, the lowest level since Nov. 25.
Each ADR represents 50 common shares in the company. The ADRs
traded 1.3 percent  higher  than the company’s  Hong Kong  stock,
which slumped 4.6 percent to HK$3.71, or 48 U.S. cents a share.
 Shanghai-traded stock  of China Southern climbed for the fifth
day in a row, adding 2.2 percent to 5.48 yuan, or 87 U.S. cents
a share.  Oil Advance Bets  Oil for April delivery retreated 1.1 percent to $108.56 a
barrel yesterday on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after
reaching a nine-month high on Feb. 24. Prices have increased 9.8
percent this year.  Hedge funds and other large speculators raised wagers on
rising oil prices by 11 percent in the week ended Feb. 21,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
Commitments of Traders report. Bets increased 26 percent over
two weeks, the biggest gain since March.  ADRs of Shanghai-based China Eastern, each representing 50
common shares, dropped for a third day, losing 2.1 percent to
$18.42, the lowest level since Feb. 1. The ADRs are trading 0.8
percent  lower  than Hong Kong-traded stock, which slid 0.7
percent to HK$2.88, the equivalent of 37 U.S. cents. China
Eastern’s Shanghai-traded  shares  gained 1.9 percent to 4.39
yuan, or 70 cents per share, yesterday.  Elong Sinks  Air China (735)  slumped 5.9 percent to HK$5.59 yesterday, the
biggest drop since Oct. 18. It was the largest decliner on the
iShares FTSE China 25 ETF, which dropped 1.1 percent to $39.71,
the lowest level since Feb. 14. The slump trimmed the fund’s
gain this year to 14 percent.  Elong Inc. (LONG) , a Chinese online travel agency whose biggest
shareholder is U.S. online travel agency Expedia Inc., sank 4.7
percent to a one-week low of $17 in New York. Beijing-based
Elong said on Feb. 23 that sales will grow between 15 percent to
25 percent in the first quarter, after rising 27 percent in the
last quarter of 2011 from a year ago to 158.2 million yuan
($25.1 million).  Elong’s bigger competitor  Ctrip.com Inc. (CTRP)  gained 6.3 percent
to a $26.81, the highest level in a month.  Carson Block is the the short seller and analyst who
sparked a 74 percent drop in Sino-Forest Corp. shares listed in
 Canada  when he said the company misstated its business.  Spreadtrum Rebounding  His latest opinions aren’t getting the same reaction as
they were in June when he told investors that Sino-Forest
overstated its timber holdings.  Focus Media Holding Ltd. (FMCN) , which
sank 39 percent when Block’s Muddy Waters LLC said on Nov. 21
that the Shanghai-based digital advertiser exaggerated its
network, has since rebounded 52 percent.  Spreadtrum Communications Inc. (SPRD) , a chipmaker in  Shanghai ,
has increased 25 percent to $15.67, from $12.49 on June 28, when
Block questioned its revenue. Focus Media and Spreadtrum say the
firm’s assertions lack merit. Spreadtrum retreated 3.9 percent
yesterday to $15.67.  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , owner of China’s largest real-estate
website, dropped 5.9 percent to $16.67, the lowest level since
Feb. 15.  Some Chinese developers are allowing first-time homebuyers
to delay down payments on homes in order to boost sales, China
Business News reported yesterday, citing unidentified agents and
sales people. Developers in cities including Nanjing, Shenzhen,
Guangzhou and Wuhan sold some projects with a 10 percent down
payment, the newspaper reported.  Sina Earnings  Chinese home prices recorded their worst performance in at
least a year in January, as none of the 70 cities monitored by
the government posting gains, according to data released by the
National Statistics Bureau on Feb. 18.  China will release its official manufacturing index for
February on March 1. The measure probably rose to 50.9 from 50.5
in January, according to the median estimate of 22 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Shares of  Sina Corp. (SINA) , which provides a Twitter-like service
in China, snapped a five trading-day drop to gain 2.5 percent to
$62.95 in New York yesterday.  In a statement issued after U.S. markets closed, Shanghai-
based Sina said net income was $9.3 million in the fourth
quarter, compared with the $10.4 million average forecast of 10
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company expects sales in the
first quarter to be between $78 million and $80 million. That
compares with the average analyst estimate of $113.7 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
