Treasury 30-year yields fell to the
lowest level in more than a week before the  Federal Reserve  buys
U.S. government debt today and on concern  Europe ’s rescue of
Greece won’t resolve the region’s debt crisis.  The Fed is  scheduled  to purchase as much as $5 billion of
notes due from February 2018 to February 2020 today as part of
its efforts to keep borrowing costs down. Policy makers will
probably announce a third round of outright purchases in the
second quarter, according to Jefferies & Co. Inc., one of the 21
primary dealers that trade with the central bank.  “The Fed wants to keep rates down,” said Roger Bridges,
who oversees the equivalent of $16 billion of debt as the
Sydney-based head of fixed income at Tyndall Investment
Management Ltd., a unit of Nikko Asset Management Co. in  Japan .
“You’ve got a buyer in the market all the time. I think
Treasuries are very expensive.”  U.S. 30-year  yields  declined one basis point to 3.09
percent as of 11:17 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The 3.125 percent security maturing in February
2042 rose 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 22/32.
The rate was as low as 3.088 percent, the least since Feb. 16.  Ten-year yields were little changed at 1.97 percent. They
are 30 basis points, or 0.30 percentage point, away from the
record low of 1.67 percent set Sept. 23.  Japan’s 10-year yield was unchanged at 0.97 percent.  Bernanke Testimony  The Fed is replacing $400 billion of shorter-maturity
Treasuries in its holdings with longer-term debt to cap
borrowing costs under a program it plans to conclude in June.  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will give his semi-annual monetary
policy report to Congress this week. He testifies before House
lawmakers on Feb. 29 and the following day to the Senate Banking
Committee.  Bernanke may use the speeches to “plant the seeds” for
additional bond buying,  Ward McCarthy  and Thomas Simons, New
York-based economists for Jefferies, wrote in a report Feb. 24.
The Fed will probably focus its purchases on mortgage-backed
securities, acquiring $500 billion to $650 billion of them to
support the U.S. housing market, the report said. The central
bank will probably also buy long-term Treasuries, it said.  Fed officials aren’t in unanimous agreement on the plan.  James Bullard , president of the Fed Bank of  St. Louis , said
he doesn’t favor additional debt buying as inflation risks are
“to the upside” and a damaged housing market limits the
effectiveness of monetary policy. Philadelphia Fed President
 Charles Plosser  said targeting a specific industry such as
housing should be left to the  U.S. Treasury .  The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of Treasury and
mortgage-related bonds between 2008 and June 2011 to support the
economy.  Group of 20 nations rebuffed German-led calls to come to
Europe’s rescue as it battles the region’s debt crisis, helping
maintain demand for the relative safety of  U.S. debt . Officials
from the countries met in Mexico City over the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
