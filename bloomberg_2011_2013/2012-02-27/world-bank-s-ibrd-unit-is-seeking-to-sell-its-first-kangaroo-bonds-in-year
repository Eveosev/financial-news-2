The World Bank’s International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development is seeking to sell kangaroo
bonds for the first time since January 2011.  The IBRD is planning to sell debt due in 2017 and 2022, in
an offering managed by Westpac Banking Corp.,  Australia  & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and TD Securities Inc., according to
an e-mailed statement from Westpac today. The Washington-based
borrower’s last offering was in January last year, when it
priced A$1 billion ($1.1 billion) of 2014 and 2020 notes,
Bloomberg data show.  Sales of kangaroo bonds, or Australian-dollar notes sold by
foreign entities in Australia, are set for the biggest monthly
total since July as IBRD and European Investment Bank return to
the market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The extra
yield investors demand to hold Australian-dollar quasi-
government debt instead of federal securities dropped 32 basis
points since Jan. 31 to 98 last week, the lowest since November,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show.  The IBRD is marketing five-year kangaroo bonds to yield
about 22 basis points, or 0.22 percentage point, more than the
asset swap rate, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The borrower is also seeking to price 10-year notes at a spread
of about 33 basis points, the person said today, asking not to
be named as the details are private.  The EIB, based in  Luxembourg , added A$600 million to an
existing line of kangaroo bonds due in June 2021 on Feb. 23,
pricing the 6.25 percent notes to yield 188.75 basis points more
than similar-maturity government debt, according to a statement
at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
