Dubai (PGCRDUBA)  crude rose for a fourth day to
the highest price since August 2008.  The Middle East benchmark increased 61 cents to $122.01,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. That is the
highest since Aug. 4, 2008. The rise comes as  South Korea ’s  SK
Innovation Co. (096770)  sold 175,000 barrels of Dubai crude in the Platts
pricing window, bringing its total sales in February to 925,000
barrels, according to a survey of traders who monitor the market.  SK sold seven 25,000 barrel Dubai partial cargoes.  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  bought three for $122.50 a barrel each. Mercuria
Energy Trading SA paid $122.50 for two and $122.55 for a third.
Vitol Group purchased one for $122.40 a barrel.  Dubai crude’s backwardation, when the price for prompt
deliveries is  greater  than for later shipments, rose 2 cents.
Swaps for March were $1.92 cents a barrel more than in May,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based
broker. The price difference, known as a timespread, has more
than doubled since the start of the month, a sign of stronger
short-term refiner demand for oil.  The April  Brent-Dubai (PVMMDBSP)  exchange for swaps, which measures
the European benchmark contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
fell 5 cents to $3.72 a barrel, the third day of declines,
according to PVM data. The May contract was down 4 cents to
$3.67.  Oman futures for April fell rose 84 cents to $122.56 a
barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 6:53 p.m. Singapore
