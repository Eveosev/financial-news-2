Rain in cocoa-producing countries in
West Africa, the world’s main growing region, is set to help the
development of the mid-crop, the smaller of two annual harvests
that usually starts in April.  Most of  Ivory Coast  and Ghana, the world’s largest cocoa
producers, will get 10 millimeters to 20 millimeters (0.4 inch
to 0.8 inch) of rainfall by March 3, according to the  National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  in  Washington .
Precipitation in some areas of Ghana will be as much as 50
millimeters, data on the NOAA’s  website  show.  Cocoa climbed 9.9 percent in  London  this year on
speculation dry conditions would hurt the development of the
crops. The dry harmattan winds from the desert are stronger,
according to Antoine Koffi Kouassi, an agro-meteorology engineer
at Ivory Coast’s National Meteorological Service.  “Rains are likely to improve crop prospects in West Africa
after dryness had caused concerns about production,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said today
by e-mail. “Prices should pare some of their recent gains as a
result.”  The central-western Daloa region, Ivory Coast’s biggest
growing area, received some rain earlier this month, with the
Daloa weather station registering rainfall of 6.1 millimeters
from Feb. 11 to 20 and 15.8 millimeters from Feb. 1 to 10,
according to data on Bloomberg. The region produces an average
300,000 metric tons of cocoa a year.  Southwestern Rains  The southwestern Soubre region in Ivory Coast, which
produces about 300,000 tons annually, also received rainfall,
with the town of  San Pedro  getting 20.6 millimeters between Feb.
11 to 20 and 15.1 millimeters a week earlier. The town of
Sassandra received 9.5 millimeters of rain between Feb. 11 to 20
and 12.6 millimeters the previous week and Tabou got 24.3
millimeters from Feb. 11 to 20 and 37.3 millimeters the previous
week, the data show.  In  Ghana , the Western region, which accounts for about 55
percent of the country’s output, also received rains from Feb.
11 to 20, data on Bloomberg show. The town of Sefwi Bekwai got
8.1 millimeters in the period, according to the data. A week
earlier, Bogoso got as much as 51.9 millimeters.  Ivory Coast and Ghana accounted for 58 percent of global
output last season, data from the London-based International
Cocoa Organization show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
