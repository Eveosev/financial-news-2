Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Britain’s
biggest mortgage lender, said Glen Moreno will step down as
deputy chairman in May.  He will be replaced by  David Roberts , a former director at
Barclays Plc, who joined the Lloyds board in 2010, the 41
percent government-owned bank said in a statement today.
During Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio’s nine-week
absence from work for exhaustion last year, Roberts was named
interim CEO in case the Portuguese national’s leave continued.  Roberts was previously head of international retail and
commercial banking at Barclays and was a member of the group
executive committee before leaving in 2006. Roberts was a non-
executive director of U.K. airport operator BAA Ltd. and a non-
executive director of Absa Group Ltd., one of  South Africa ’s
largest financial-services groups, until 2006. He was chairman
and CEO of Austrian lender Bawag PSK Bank from 2007 to 2009.  Separately, Lloyds said last week that its new finance
director, George Culmer, will join the lender on May 15.  Moreno has been chairman of Pearson Plc, the publisher of
the Financial Times newspaper, since October 2005. He is a
director of Fidelity International Ltd. and chairman of its
 audit committee . He is also deputy chairman of the Financial
Reporting Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
