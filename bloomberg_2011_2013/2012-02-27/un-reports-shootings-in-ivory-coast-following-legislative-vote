The  United Nations  said that
unidentified gunmen fired yesterday on a peacekeeping convoy
carrying ballot boxes after a legislative poll in the western
region of Ivory Coast.  The shooting happened after an election for 12 legislative
openings as ballot boxes were being transported to Bonon from
Gobazra, Vannina Maestracci, a UN spokeswoman in  New York , said
in a telephone interview. The peacekeepers responded to the
fire, and there were no deaths reported.  UN representatives also returned fire after another attack
at an election office in Bonon, the UN said in a statement.  Voting was held after reported irregularities during a
December election. Violence erupted last year following a
disputed 2010 presidential election. As many as 3,000 people
died during the five-month crisis that disrupted the economy and
trade, according to the International Criminal Court.  Ivory
Coast  is the worldâ€™s top cocoa producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
