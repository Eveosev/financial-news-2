South Africa , the biggest corn
producer on the continent, may forecast a crop of 11.4 million
metric tons tomorrow.  The median estimate of seven traders surveyed by Bloomberg
compares with 10.4 million tons produced last year.  The Crop Estimates Committee will release its first
estimate for the season at 3:30 p.m. in Johannesburg.  The committee may say farmers will plant about 2.59 million
hectares (6.4 million acres) with the grain, up from 2.37
million hectares last season, according to the median estimate
of eight traders surveyed by Bloomberg News. Estimates ranged
from 2.60 million to 2.66 million hectares.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract on
the South African Futures Exchange, rose 2.2 percent to 2,058
rand ($269) a ton by the noon close in Johannesburg trading.
Yellow corn climbed 1.2 percent to 2,001.20 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
