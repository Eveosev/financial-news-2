India’s benchmark stock index fell
to its lowest level in two weeks amid concern rising oil prices
will threaten the government’s efforts to curb inflation and
 interest rates .  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the nation’s biggest engineering
company, slid to a two-month low.   ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , country’s
largest private lender, dropped to the lowest in a month.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, fell 0.7 percent
to 17,796.54 at 9:43 a.m. in Mumbai, set for its lowest level
since Feb. 13. The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock
Exchange of India Ltd. slid 0.7 percent to 5,388.10. The BSE 200
Index declined 0.4 percent to 2,189.73.  Oil climbed for a seventh day on Feb. 24, the longest run
of gains since Jan. 10, to settle at a nine-month high. Higher
energy price raise costs for consumers and companies in India,
which imports three-quarters of its oil needs.  The 30-company Sensex had its first weekly loss in eight
last week on concern oil-price gains may fuel inflation and
prevent the  Reserve Bank of India  from easing monetary policy.  Consumer  prices  rose 7.65 percent in January from a year
earlier, exceeding the 6.55 percent advance in the benchmark
wholesale  price index  last month, according to government data
last week. Central-bank Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said this
month that the authority will reduce borrowing costs once it’s
confident inflation will keep slowing.  The RBI pared banks’ reserve requirements last month for
the first time since 2009. The bank meets for its next policy
review on March 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
