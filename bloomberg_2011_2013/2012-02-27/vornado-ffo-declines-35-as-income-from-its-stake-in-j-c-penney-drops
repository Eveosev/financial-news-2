Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) , owner of more
than 100 million square feet (9.3 million square meters) of U.S.
properties, said fourth-quarter funds from operations dropped 35
percent as income from its stake in J.C. Penney & Co fell.  FFO, which gauges a property company’s ability to generate
cash, was $280.4 million, or $1.46 a share, compared with $432.9
million, or $2.27, a year earlier, the New York-based real
estate investment trust said today in a regulatory filing.
Vornado was expected to have FFO of $1.24 a share, the average
estimate of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg  survey .  Income from Vornado’s 11 percent stake in the Plano, Texas-
based retailer declined to $40.1 million from $97.9 million at
the end of 2010, according to the filing. Vornado’s year-earlier
results included a gain of about $54 million from its sale in
October 2010 of a 45 percent share of the Warner Building, an
office property at 1299 Pennsylvania Ave. in  Washington .  “We expect continued earnings volatility related to the
 J.C. Penney (JCP)  investment” as well as Vornado’s stakes in the toy
merchant Toys ‘R’ Us Inc. and other companies outside its real
estate holdings, John Guinee, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus &
Co. in Baltimore, said in a Feb. 3 report.  FFO after adjustments to remove items that aren’t
comparable quarter to quarter, including the J.C. Penney income,
totaled $220.1 million, or $1.15 a share, up from $218.3 million
a year earlier. Adjusted FFO was unchanged on a per-share basis.
Revenue rose 5.5 percent to $741.8 million.  Washington Offices  Vornado had 20.6 million square feet of offices in the
Washington market, including northern Virginia, and 19.2 million
square feet in  Manhattan (COLA)  as of Sept. 30, according to a third-
quarter filing. It also owns street retail properties in
 Manhattan , shopping malls across the U.S. and  Chicago ’s
Merchandise Mart showroom complex.  Occupancy at the company’s Washington-area office
properties fell to 88.7 percent at the end of last year, from 94
percent at the end of 2010, according to the filing.  Vornado faces lease expirations in northern Virginia, where
it expects the U.S. Defense Department to vacate about 2.4
million square feet as it shifts operations from rented space to
military bases, Vornado said in the filing.  “Whether it’s state, local or federal government, if
you’re planning on growth, you can’t,” said Tim Pire, portfolio
manager for Chicago-based Heitman LLC, which said it held
797,668 Vornado shares on behalf of clients as of Dec. 31.  ‘Bumpy Demand’  The office vacancy rate in northern  Virginia  rose to 16.5
percent at the end of last year, the highest since 2004, and
will probably increase because of corporate job cuts and Defense
Department departures, brokerage Cushman & Wakefield Inc. said
in a January report.  Space demand in the  District of Columbia  is expected to be
“bumpy” in an election year, the New York-based firm said in a
separate report.  Occupancy at Vornado’s  New York  office properties was 95.6
percent, unchanged from a year earlier. Revenue from the New
York offices rose less than 1 percent to $281.3 million, while
in Washington it fell 1 percent to $157.6 million.  Fourth-quarter results were announced after the close of
regular U.S. trading. Vornado fell 0.6 percent to $84.21 today
in New York. The shares have lost 10 percent the last 12 months,
compared with a 3 percent advance in the  Bloomberg REIT Index. (BBREIT)   To contact the reporter on this story:
