General Maritime Corp. (GMRRQ) , the second-
largest U.S. owner of  oil tankers , filed an amended
reorganization plan after unsecured creditors objected to its
previous proposal.  The amended plan doesnâ€™t address objections raised Feb. 21
by the official committee of unsecured creditors that the
company failed to explore alternatives to a $175 million equity
investment from Oaktree Capital Management LP, according to
papers filed yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in New York.  Under the reorganization plan, General Maritime would pay
secured claims in full, reduce debt by $600 million and raise
$61.3 million in a rights offering. The amended plan changes the
rights offering schedule to allow claims as of March 26.  General Maritime, which operates in more than 230 ports of
call in more than 70 countries, filed for bankruptcy in
November. The company listed assets of $1.71 billion and debt of
$1.41 billion in its Chapter 11 petition.  The case is In re General Maritime Corp., 11-15285, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
