Libya  will announce a law that will
return land and buildings expropriated by late ruler Muammar Qaddafi to the original landowners “within weeks,” a senior
member of the Land Ownership Committee said.  “Phase one will return unused lands, empty shops,
buildings and villas taken by Qaddafi’s regime and then by the
rebels to the rightful owners,” said Fawzy Sheibany, legal
representative for the committee, in an interview in the
capital, Tripoli. “This will mean millions of dinars can be
invested in construction projects and provide employment.”  Phase two of the new law involves rehousing families
residing in buildings on expropriated land and could take
several years to implement fully, he said.  The Ministry of Justice will deal with individual cases
through a civil court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
