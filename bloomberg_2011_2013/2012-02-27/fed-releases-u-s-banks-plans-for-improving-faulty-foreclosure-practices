The  Federal Reserve  released
documents showing how U.S. mortgage servicers pledged to
overhaul faulty foreclosure practices that led to this month’s
$25 billion settlement with state and federal authorities.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  were among lenders that submitted the so-called action
plans following a Fed enforcement action last year. The
documents describe how firms will strengthen communications with
borrowers, limit certain foreclosures and bolster compliance
programs, the Fed said today in a statement. It also released
“engagement letters” between firms and outside consultants.  “Examiners found unsafe and unsound processes and
practices in residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure
processing at a number of supervised institutions” during
reviews from November 2010 to January 2011, the Fed said. The
central bank will “closely follow” implementation of the plans
to ensure deficiencies are fixed, it said.  Servicers agreed in an April settlement to improve
foreclosure, loan-modification and refinancing procedures by
hiring staff, upgrading document-tracking systems, assigning a
single point of contact for each borrower and policing lawyers
and vendors. Earlier this month, the five largest servicers
agreed to pay penalties and provide relief to borrowers in
resolving related claims with state and federal authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
