New York  extended its lead over
London as the top destination for commercial real-estate
investment as the U.S. economy revived and Europe’s debt crisis
discouraged some buying in the region, property broker Cushman &
Wakefield Inc. said today in a report.  Investment for commercial properties rose to $35.7 billion
in New York last year, including multifamily buildings, making
it the largest target for buyers at a city level, the broker
said. That compares with $29.2 billion in London and $22.6
billion for Tokyo.  Commercial investment globally rose 14 percent in 2011 to
$727 billion, or $808 billion including multifamily properties,
Cushman & Wakefield said, with volumes up 83 percent from 2009.
New York overtook  London  as the No. 1 destination for real-
estate investment in the twelve months through August for the
first time since 2007 as improved access to financing spurred
deals. At the time, New York led London by $2.5 billion.  “There was a flight to quality in the Americas,” said
Greg Vorwaller, global head of capital markets for Cushman &
Wakefield. Investors focused “on best-in-class assets in
flagship markets” including New York, Washington,  San
Francisco , Boston,  Los Angeles  and Chicago, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
