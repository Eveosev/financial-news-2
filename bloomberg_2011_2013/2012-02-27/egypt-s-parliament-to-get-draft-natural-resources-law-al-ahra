A draft natural resources law will
soon go to parliament for consideration, Egyptian Oil Minister
Abdalla Ghorab was quoted as saying by state run  Al-Ahram  today.  Ghorab said the draft law, which would replace legislation
passed in 1956, seeks to encourage investment in the country’s
natural resources and maximize the industrial value of the raw
materials produced by  Egypt  instead of exporting them, the
Cairo-based newspaper reported.  Al-Ahram did not say when the bill would be submitted to
lawmakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
