The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose after the Group of
20 nations refused to help bolster the region’s bailout funds.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 13
basis points to 586.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 12
p.m. in  London . The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of
swaps on 15 governments climbed 2 basis points to 346.5.  G-20 officials meeting in Mexico City at the weekend told
euro-area policy makers to offer more financial firepower before
they could consider lending outside support. Leaders of the 17-
member monetary union have said they’ll decide in March whether
to lift a 500 billion-euro ($672 billion) limit to bailout
funding, with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government
resisting lifting its contribution.  “It’s clear that the non-Eurozone members are reluctant to
commit further funds until the EU and  Germany  clarify exactly to
what scale they’ll allow the various bailout packages to run
to,” said  Brian Barry , an analyst at Investec Bank Plc in
London.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of swaps on 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings was 2 basis points higher at
132.8. An increase signals deterioration in perceptions of
 credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers rose 3 basis points to 216 basis points
and the subordinated index climbed 4.5 basis points to 364
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
