Dubai’s benchmark  stock index 
retreated the most in more than two months on investor
speculation this month’s rally was overdone and after the  Dubai
Financial Market PJSC (DFM)  posted its first full-year loss.  Dubai Financial Market, the only publicly traded Gulf Arab
stock market, declined 4.2 percent.  Aramex PJSC (ARMX)  retreated the
most in almost two months after the largest courier company in
the Middle East reduced its dividend compared with 2010. The  DFM
General Index (DFMGI)  fell 1.3 percent, the most since Dec. 21, to
1,654.20 at the 2 p.m. close in the emirate. The measure, which
entered a  bull market  last week, has surged 27 percent from a
low in January.  “We are at the point where our markets are likely to take
a breather,” said Dubai-based Ibrahim Masood, who helps manage
about $400 million at  Mashreqbank PSC. (MASQ)  “Local retail are doing
the buying, and none of them are the kind to buy and hold; this
hot potato is in slippery hands.”  Dubai’s stocks have soared 15 percent so far this month
after companies reported improved earnings and dividends. The
value of shares traded jumped to 713 million dirhams ($194
million) yesterday, the highest since April 2010, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The  value traded  declined to about
469 million dirhams today.  Dubai Financial Market, which yesterday surged 8.5 percent,
declined the most since Jan. 16 to 95.5 fils. The  net loss  for
the group, including Nasdaq Dubai, was 6.9 million dirhams after
a profit of 78.9 million dirhams a year earlier. Trading volumes
in Dubai slumped to a six-year low in 2011, hurting the
company’s revenues.  Oil Declines  Aramex dropped 3.1 percent, the most since Dec. 29, to 1.89
dirhams. The courier said the board proposed a dividend of 5
fils a share for 2011. That compares with the 7.5 fils it paid
for 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Oil fell, halting its longest rally in two years, after the
International Monetary Fund warned that the global economy is
still at risk of a slowdown. Oil for April delivery dropped as
much as 1.4 percent to $108.24 a barrel in electronic trading on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gulf Arab oil exporters,
including Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, supply about a
fifth of the world’s oil.  Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  fell 0.2 percent. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General
Index (ADSMI)  rose 0.1 percent in its seventh day of gains. Bahrain’s  BB
All Share Index (BHSEASI)  increased 0.2 percent and Oman’s  MSM 30 Index (MSM30) 
rose 0.5 percent. Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index added
0.9 percent and the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  increased 0.4
percent. Kuwait market was closed for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
