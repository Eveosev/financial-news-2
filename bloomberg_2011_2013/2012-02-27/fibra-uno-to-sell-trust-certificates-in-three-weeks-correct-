(Corrects nature of the transaction to real estate trust
certificates from bonds.)   Fibra Uno Administracion SAB,
 Mexico ’s only real estate investment trust, plans to sell trust
certificates in Mexico and the U.S. in the next three weeks,
said Chief Financial Officer, Javier Elizalde.  “We are planning to start a road show next Monday and we
expect to close the books in about three weeks,” Elizalde said
today in a telephone interview in Mexico City.  The company aims to sell 50 percent of the real estate
trust certificates in Mexico and 50 percent in the U.S.,
Elizalde said, without providing the amount of the transaction.
The real estate trust certificates are known in Spanish as
certificados bursatiles fiduciarios inmobiliarios or CBFI.  Fibra Uno plans to use the proceeds of the sale to acquire
real estate assets, the company said today in a filing with
Mexico’s stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
