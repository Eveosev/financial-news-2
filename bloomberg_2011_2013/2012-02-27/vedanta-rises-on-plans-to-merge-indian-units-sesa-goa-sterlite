Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , a metals and
oil producer, climbed to a 6-month high in London trading after
announcing plans to combine its publicly traded Indian units
into a new company to cut debt.  Vedanta rose as much as 4.3 percent to 1,564 pence, the
highest intraday level since Aug. 4, and traded at 1,509 pence
at 11 a.m. local time.  Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA) , India’s biggest iron-ore
exporter, will absorb  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT)  in an
all-share deal, Vedanta said on Feb. 25. Investors will get
three Sesa Goa shares for five shares of Sterlite.  Vedanta, which last year acquired a controlling stake in
the oil producer  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR)  for $8.67 billion, will
transfer its 38.8 percent stake in the company, including a debt
of $5.9 billion, to  Sesa Sterlite , the new company that will
hold 58.9 percent of Cairn India.  “Game-changing transaction is here,” Ash Lazenby, an
analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd., said in a note. The plan is 12
percent earnings per share “accretive, debt fears resolved.”  Vedanta’s debt  will fall 61 percent to $3.8 billion and the
debt-service cost will be reduced by $300 million for the year
ending March 31, 2013, the company said on Feb. 25.  The combined entity would have had $5.4 billion of earnings
before interest, tax, devaluation and amortization in 2011 and
$7.9 billion net debt, Lazenby said. That’s 1.5 times net debt
to equity and “rating agencies should favor the new entity.”  The merged entity, in which Vedanta will hold a 58.3
percent stake, will help save $200 million annually, Navin Agarwal said on a conference call on Feb. 25. The merger will
probably be completed this year, he said.  Sesa Goa shares skidded 10 percent to 203.85 rupees in
Mumbai trading while Sterlite,  India ’s largest copper producer,
fell 2.5 percent to 115.7 rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
