Aramex PJSC (ARMX)  headed for the biggest
drop in a year and led the decline in Dubai’s benchmark stock
index after the courier company cut its dividend.  The shares slid 5.1 percent, poised for the biggest slump
since February 2011, to 1.85 dirhams at 1:17 p.m. in Dubai. The
stock was the biggest loser by index points on Dubai’s  DFM
General Index, (DFMGI)  which retreated 1 percent, the most since Feb.
15. Aramex has gained 2.8 percent so far this year compared with
a  23 percent increase  in Dubai’s benchmark.  The company “used to give higher rates” and the current
dividend “is less than what investors expected,” said Samer Darwiche, a Dubai-based associate at Gulfmena Investments.  The board of Aramex, the largest courier company in the
 Middle East ,  proposed a dividend  of 5 fils a share for last
year, 2.5 fils less than what it paid for 2010, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Trading values in Dubai  had improved
after companies paid higher dividends and posted an increase in
earnings. The benchmark index surged 2.7 percent yesterday as
the value of shares traded soared to the highest since April
2010.  Aramex, which said Feb. 2 it will focus on strategic
expansion in  emerging markets , posted a  4 percent increase  in
fourth-quarter profit to 57.2 million dirhams ($16 million). The
company last year acquired Oneworld Courier and In-Time Couriers
in  Kenya  and Berco Express (Pty) Ltd. of  South Africa .  “Aramex made acquisitions in 2011 to expand, so a lower
dividend is actually a prudent step,” Gulfmena’s Darwiche said.  Eight analysts  recommend investors  buy Aramex shares, while
two have a hold rating, according to data on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
