U.S. exports of boxloads of goods
slid 0.2 percent last quarter compared with a year earlier as
slowing manufacturing in Europe and  Asia  curbed demand for waste
paper and scrap metal, The Journal of Commerce/PIERS said.  The U.S. shipped 3,002,088 twenty-foot units in the fourth
quarter of 2011, down from 3,007,531 units a year before,
according to data provided today by  Newark , New Jersey-based
PIERS, a unit of UBM Global Trade that tracks volumes through
ports. The decline was led by decreases in exports of fabrics
and animal feeds, while growth in shipments of waste paper, the
largest cargo, slowed to 2 percent from 9 percent in the third
quarter, said Mario Moreno, an economist at UBM Global Trade.  “The whole entire world except the U.S. decelerated in the
fourth quarter, and that led to a decline in exports,” he said.
“Waste paper and scrap metal are a key component for the
manufacturing sector.”  The world economy expanded 2.19 percent in the fourth
quarter, the slowest pace since the final three months of 2009,
according to economists’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
 Europe ’s growth slowed to 0.9 percent and  China ’s to 8.9
percent, the slowest since June 2009, data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
