Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  fell 1.5 percent to 58,821.82 at the close in Istanbul,
its lowest in almost a month, and led declines among all markets
in eastern  Europe  and the  Middle East . Of 100 companies on the
index, 78 fell.  The following stocks were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  , the bank part-owned by  Citigroup
Inc. (C) , led declines on the banking index, slipping 2.4 percent to
6.62 liras, its lowest in more than a month.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) 
today followed  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  in downgrading
Turkish equities. The outlook for bank earnings doesn’t justify
current valuations, Deutsche Bank said.  Albarak Turk Katilim Bankasi AS (ALBRK)  , an  Islamic
bank (QIBK) , dropped 3.1 percent to 1.89 liras, its biggest loss since
Jan. 6. Albaraka won’t pay a dividend from last year’s profit,
the lender said in a statement to the exchange today.  Tofas Turk Otomobil Fabrikasi AS (TOASO)  , the unit of
 Fiat SpA (F)  in partnership with  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) , fell 3.3 percent to
7.02 liras, its lowest in more than six weeks. Concern higher
energy costs will hurt economic growth and erode earnings at
airlines and automakers sent emerging market stocks down from a
six-month high.  Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO, the national carrier known
as Turkish Airlines, plunged 5.9 percent to 2.57 liras, its
biggest decline since November 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
