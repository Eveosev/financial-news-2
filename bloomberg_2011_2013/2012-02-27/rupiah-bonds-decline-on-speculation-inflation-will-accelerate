Indonesia ’s rupiah dropped to the
lowest level in six weeks and bonds declined on concern
government plans to reduce fuel subsidies will stoke inflation.  The Jakarta Composite Index of shares fell for a fourth day
after Bank Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution said on Feb. 23
that inflation may exceed the central bank’s target of a maximum
of 5.5 percent this year if fuel prices are raised by 1,000
rupiah ($0.11) per liter or more. Overseas funds sold $99
million more local stocks than they bought on Feb. 24, exchange
data show.  “There’s a bit of concern on the fuel policy and how it’s
going to affect inflation,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of
foreign-exchange research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore.
“The outflow from equities” was because of that concern, he
said.  The rupiah weakened 0.6 percent to 9,172 per dollar as of
3:13 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 9,214 earlier, the
lowest level since Jan. 16. Losses will probably be limited as
 Bank Indonesia  may intervene, said Supaat.  “The central bank is mostly concerned about volatility,
not so much about targeting a certain level,” he said.
“They’re uncomfortable about sharp, rapid shifts in the
currency.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
rose 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage points, to 5.57 percent,
according to midday prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  Inflation slowed for a fifth straight month in January,
easing to 3.65 percent, official data show.  The decision whether to increase subsidized fuel prices
will depend on the government’s discussion with the parliament
to revise the 2012 state budget in March, Coordinating Minister
for the Economy Hatta Rajasa said on Feb. 23. Jero Wacik, the
energy and mineral minister, said the government is proposing an
increase of 500 rupiah to 1,500 rupiah per liter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
