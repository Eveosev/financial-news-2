Standard & Poor’s  cut its outlook on
the euro-area bailout fund to “negative,” reflecting a similar
move on two euro-area nations that guarantee the facility.  “We have concluded that credit enhancements sufficient to
offset what we view as the reduced creditworthiness of European
Financial Stability Facility guarantors are not likely to be
forthcoming,” S&P said in an e-mailed statement in  London 
today. The negative outlook “mirrors the negative outlooks of
France and Austria.”  The EFSF lost its top  credit rating  in January after
earlier downgrades of those nations. S&P said today that it may
downgrade the EFSF should it lower the credit ratings of any of
the facility’s guarantors rated AAA or AA+, including  Germany ,
France, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and Luxembourg.  “Today’s rating move is a further wake-up call for policy
makers to speed up the start of the ESM, the permanent euro-area
bailout mechanism, with the hope that it will be uncorrelated
from EMU members’ own ratings,” Thomas Costerg, an economist at
Standard Chartered Bank in London, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
