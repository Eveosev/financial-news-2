Employment will improve more this
year than economists previously estimated, helping the world’s
largest economy to keep growing, a private survey showed.  Payrolls will rise 170,000 a month on average in 2012, up
from a November projection of 127,000, according to the results
of a survey by the  National Association for Business Economics 
issued today in Washington. Unemployment will average 8.3
percent, down from 8.9 percent in the prior forecast.  The better outlook for jobs coincides with larger gains in
business investment and homebuilding than were anticipated, the
survey showed. At the same time, economists maintained forecasts
for  consumer spending , which may rise 2.1 percent, and predicted
economic growth of 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier, unchanged from the November survey.  Respondents “are seeing strength in a number of economic
measures,” Gene Huang, NABE president and chief economist at
FedEx Corp., said in a statement. “Forecast uncertainty among
the economists appears to have diminished slightly over the last
several months,” while they “remain guarded on U.S. economic
growth,” he said.  Three straight months of faster job growth are helping to
sustain the economic expansion that began in June 2009.
Employers added 243,000 jobs in January, the most in nine
months, and the  unemployment rate  fell to 8.3 percent, the
lowest since February 2009, according to the Labor Department.  Capital Spending  Estimates for 2012 spending on new equipment and software
rose to 8.1 percent from 8 percent, today’s NABE report said.
Economists in the latest survey predicted housing starts will
climb to 700,000, compared with a November forecast of 660,000.  The job market may accelerate more next year, the survey
showed. Monthly payroll gains are forecast to average 183,000 in
2013, and the unemployment rate may drop to 7.8 percent.  Inflation is likely to stay contained even as the economy
expands. The cost of living index will rise 2.1 percent, less
than the 2.2 percent annual average increase projected in the
November survey.  Forty-five NABE members responded to the survey, conducted
between Jan. 26 and Feb. 8. The National Association for
Business Economics, founded in 1959, is the professional
organization for people who use economics in their work.  To contact the reporter on this story:
