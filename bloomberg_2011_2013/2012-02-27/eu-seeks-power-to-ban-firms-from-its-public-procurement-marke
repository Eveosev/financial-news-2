The European Union’s executive will
seek the power to block companies based outside the EU from
bidding for public procurement contracts in  Europe  as part of
plans to boost the bloc’s arsenal against trade discrimination.  The EU’s top financial-services and trade officials plan to
propose next month that the European Commission in Brussels
should have the power to ban companies from winning public
procurement contracts in the region if they are based in
countries that “repeatedly discriminate” against European
firms,  Chantal Hughes , a spokesperson for the commission, said
today in an e-mail.  The measure will be part of a broader proposal that will
also clarify what access foreign companies get to EU public
procurement markets through free-trade agreements and other
accords, Hughes said. The aim of the initiative is to “re-
establish a fair competition on the European market,” Hughes
said.  The announcement of the measure, to be presented on March
21 by Financial Services Commissioner  Michel Barnier  and Trade
Commissioner Karel De Gucht, comes as the EU clashes with  China 
over possible subsidies for Chinese steel exports. China said
last week that its businesses are “strongly dissatisfied” with
the EU’s announcement last week that it may impose tariffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
