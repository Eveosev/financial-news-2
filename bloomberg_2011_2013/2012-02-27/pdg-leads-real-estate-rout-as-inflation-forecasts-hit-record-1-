PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos e
Participacoes SA ,  Brazil ’s biggest homebuilder by revenue,
dropped to a one-month low as it led a rout in real-estate
stocks after economists raised their 2013 inflation forecast to
the highest on record.  PDG  lost  3.2 percent to 7.22 reais at the close of trading
in Sao Paulo. The benchmark Bovespa dropped 1.1 percent. The
BM&F Bovespa Real Estate index fell 1.2 percent, with 14 of 21
members declining.  Homebuilders dropped as economists increased their 2013
inflation forecast to the highest on record. Consumer prices in
Brazil will rise 5.11 percent next year, according to the median
forecast in a central bank survey of about 100 economists
published today, up from last week’s estimate of 5.02 percent.
The yield on the Brazilian interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2013 rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
9.33 percent.  PDG and other homebuilders fell as they were “reacting to
a worse perspective for inflation and, therefore, for Brazilian
monetary policy,” Felipe Miranda, an analyst at Gradius Gestao,
which manages 150 million reais in  Sao Paulo , wrote in an e-
mail. “Stocks are very sensitive to that kind of expectation.”  The so-called “neutral” rate of interest needed to keep
inflation on target with the economy growing at a sustainable
pace is 5.5 percent after adjustments for inflation, according
to the median estimate in a survey of economists published Feb.
23. That is higher than the current inflation-adjusted interest
rate of 4.3 percent.  Interest-Rate Cuts  Since August, policy makers have cut the Selic rate four
times, reduced taxes and pledged to boost public investments to
ensure growth of 4.5 percent this year. The stimulus has raised
concern among economists that central bank President Alexandre Tombini may fail to fulfill his pledge to slow inflation to the
bank’s 4.5 percent target this year.  The higher inflation forecast came after Tombini reiterated
at a meeting of finance officials from the Group of 20 richest
nations over the weekend that there is a high chance the central
bank will cut the benchmark  interest rate  to less than 10
percent this year, from the current 10.5 percent.  Cyrela Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes 
slipped 3.2 percent to 17.42 reais.  Brookfield Incorporacoes SA (BISA3) 
dropped 3 percent to 6.45 reais.  Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3)  fell 2.9
percent to 10.21 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
