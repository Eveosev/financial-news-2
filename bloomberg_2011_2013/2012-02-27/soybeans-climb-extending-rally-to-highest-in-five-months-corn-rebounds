Soybean futures rallied to a five-
month high on speculation that demand will increase for U.S.
exports after drought damaged crops in  South America . Corn also
rose.  Soybean output in  Brazil , the world’s largest grower after
the U.S., will drop to 68 million metric tons this year from
75.3 million in 2011, researcher AgRural Commodities Agricolas,
based in the state of Parana, said today. The crop in  Argentina (US38PRAR) 
will be 44.5 million tons, down from a January forecast of 49
million, the Rosario Cereals Exchange said Feb. 23.  “Smaller crops in South America continue to provide
support for the market,”  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice
president at the Linn Group in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “People are looking for  China  to switch some
purchases from South America to U.S. origin.”  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 1.2 percent to close
at $13.025 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
after reaching $13.04, the highest for the most-active futures
since Sept. 22. Prices rose for a sixth straight session, the
longest rally this year. The commodity is up 8.6 percent in
February, heading for the biggest monthly gain since December
2010.  Corn futures for May delivery advanced 0.7 percent to
$6.485 a bushel on the CBOT, the fourth straight gain. The grain
rose on speculation that China may boost purchases from the U.S.
to rebuild inventories before the growing season, after domestic
prices reached a five-month high, Huckabay said.  “It’s cheaper to import U.S. corn into China than to use
domestic supplies,” Huckabay said.  The U.S. was the world’s largest exporter of both
commodities in the year that ended Sept. 30, according to
government estimates. Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at
$76.5 billion in 2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion.  Argentina  is the top exporter of livestock feed and cooking
oil made from soybeans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
