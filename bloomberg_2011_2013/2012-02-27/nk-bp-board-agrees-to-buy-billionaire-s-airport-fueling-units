TNK-BP,  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Russian venture
with a group of billionaires, will boost  capital spending  on new
projects in 2012 and 2013 after posting record profit last year.  Expenditure will probably rise 17 percent to $5.5 billion
this year as the company increases investment in oil and gas
projects in Russia’s Yamal region, Chief Financial Officer
 Jonathan Muir  told journalists today in Moscow. The figure may
increase to $6 billion the following year, he said.  TNK-BP plans to keep output growing as Siberian deposits
decline with oil and gas from the Yamal region and international
projects. The company is seeking to produce 500,000 barrels of
oil equivalent a day from Yamal by 2020, it said today in a
presentation. TNK-BP’s oil and natural gas output in the fourth
quarter rose to 2.04 million barrels a day, the company said.  Output from assets in Vietnam and  Venezuela  acquired last
year will probably average 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent a
day this year, Muir said. The Moscow-based company has also
handed information to Brazilian regulators over an acquisition
in the country, he said. TNK-BP may borrow as much as $2 billion
this year, with about half replacing debt coming due, Muir said.  Net income rose 55 percent to a record $9 billion last year
on higher oil prices and output, and after the company paid $7.9
billion in dividends to shareholders BP and AAR, which holds the
billionaires’ interests, according to a company presentation.
Fourth-quarter profit rose 12 percent to $2.17 billion on sales
that grew to $15.7 billion from $12.5 billion a year before.  The price of Urals crude,  Russia ’s main export blend,
averaged $108.82 a barrel in the quarter, up 28 percent on the
same period last year, according to Bloomberg calculations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
