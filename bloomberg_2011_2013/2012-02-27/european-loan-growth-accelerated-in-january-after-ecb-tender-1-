Growth in loans to households and
companies in the 17-nation euro area accelerated in January
after the  European Central Bank  injected a record amount of cash
into the banking system.  Loans to the private sector grew 1.1 percent from a year
earlier after gaining an annual 1 percent in December, the ECB
said today. The rate of growth in  M3 money supply , which the
Frankfurt-based ECB uses as a gauge of future inflation,
increased to 2.5 percent from 1.5 percent.  The central bank is flooding the market with cheap money to
head off a credit crunch, encourage lending to companies and
consumers and spur demand for unsecured bank debt. Financial
institutions will seek 470 billion euros ($633 billion) in a
second round of unlimited three-year funds on Feb. 29,
approaching the 489 billion-euro take-up at the first such
operation in December, according to the median estimate of 28
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  While banks used the initial three-year loans to repurchase
bonds coming due in the first quarter, they will be more
inclined to use the second batch “to expand credit into the
real economy,” ECB President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday after
a meeting of finance officials from the Group of 20 nations in
Mexico City.  M3 grew 2 percent in the three months through January from
the same period a year earlier, the ECB said. M3 is the broadest
gauge of  money supply  and includes cash in circulation, some
forms of savings and money-market holdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
