A program designed to help
homeowners who have lost equity in their properties has
generated “tremendous borrower interest,” said Edward J.
DeMarco, acting director of the  Federal Housing Finance Agency .  DeMarco made his comments in written testimony prepared for
delivery tomorrow to the Senate Banking Committee. The Home
Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, allows borrowers to
refinance their mortgages even if they are underwater, or owe
more on their homes than they’re worth. DeMarco said he
expects to see “an increase in HARP volume.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
