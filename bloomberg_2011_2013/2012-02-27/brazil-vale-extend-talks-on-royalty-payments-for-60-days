Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, received an extra 60 days to negotiate an end to a
dispute over unpaid royalties, according to a press official at
Brazil’s National Mineral Production Department.  Vale  and the Brazilian government extended the talks after
failing to reach an agreement over the amount of royalties owed
by the company, the official at the government body, known as
DNPM, said by telephone from Brasilia today. The official
couldn’t be identified according to government policy.  Rio de Janeiro-based Vale has been fighting tax claims from
the government amid growth in its exports and rising minerals
prices. The company and the DNPM set up in August a group to
discuss the amount of disputed royalties and failed to reach an
agreement by the original October deadline.  The government is seeking tax payments on unpaid royalties
from operations in  Brazil , the company said in an April 28
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
estimating that the tax liability could be as much as 7.88
billion reais ($4.62 billion). Brazil is also looking for
additional tax payments on profits at Vale’s foreign operations.  A Vale official in Rio, who declined to be named citing
corporate policy, said the company won’t comment when contacted
by Bloomberg News today.  Vale  lost  1 percent to 42.53 reais in  Sao Paulo  at 5:52
p.m., its biggest decline in ten days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
