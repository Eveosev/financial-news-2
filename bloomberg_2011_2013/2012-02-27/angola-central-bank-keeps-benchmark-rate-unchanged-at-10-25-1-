The central bank of  Angola ,  Africa ’s
second-biggest oil producer, kept its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged to help boost the economy as the inflation rate was
little changed in January.  The key lending rate, introduced in October, was left at
10.25 percent, Banco Nacional de Angola said in an e-mailed
statement today from Luanda, the capital. The bank cut the rate
for the first time last month, reducing it by a quarter of a
percentage point after inflation slowed in 2011.  The rediscount rate dropped 50 basis points to 12 percent,
while the Luanda interbank offered rate, or Luibor, was
unchanged, the central bank said.  Inflation in Angola accelerated to 11.5 percent in January
from 11.4 percent a month earlier, the statistics office said on
Feb. 9. Angola targeted inflation of below 12 percent last year
and plans to bring it down to 10 percent in 2012. The southern
African nation’s economy expanded 3.4 percent last year,
according to the  International Monetary Fund . The government is
forecasting growth of 12.8 percent for 2012.  The MPC was formed in August amid the country’s attempts to
improve financial management after it secured a loan from the
IMF in 2009. Commercial banks previously used domestic-bond
yields and other financial instruments to determine lending
costs for clients. The benchmark rate was set at 10.5 percent in
the committee’s first decision announced on Oct. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
