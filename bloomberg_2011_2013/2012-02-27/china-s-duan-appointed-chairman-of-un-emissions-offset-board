China ’s Duan Maosheng has been
appointed chairman of the United Nations Clean Development
Mechanism executive board.  Duan, professor at the Institute of Energy, Environment and
Economy at  Tsinghua University (TSHUNZ) , joined the board in 2010 and
served as its vice chairman in 2011, according to an e-mailed
statement from the UN Framework Convention on  Climate Change .  China has produced 506.5 million metric tons of emission
credits since supply began in 2005, 59 percent of the total. The
price has plunged 57 percent in the past year because of an
oversupply in the European Union carbon market and rules
limiting their use. Credits for December rose 1 cent to 5.05
euros a ton today on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London
as of 4:29 p.m.  “China is going to be a big focus this year in the CDM
market,” said Isabelle Curien, an analyst for  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) 
in Paris. EU lawmakers have banned the use of some industrial-
gas credits starting May 2013, most of which been supplied by
China.  The EU, which operates the biggest carbon market by traded
volume, will also stop use of credits from projects not
registered by the end of this year, unless they are located in
least-developed nations, according to rules of the market.  The U.K.’s Martin Hession, former chairman, has been
appointed vice chairman. Both chairman and vice chairman were
elected unopposed, according to a  webcast  today of the board’s
first meeting for the year in Bonn.  To contact the reporters on this story:
