The U.S. may surpass Russia as the
world’s largest energy producer in the next 10 years as output
of natural gas climbs, according to Pacific Investment
Management Co.’s  Mark Kiesel .  New oil shale development will start to pay off in the next
few years, Kiesel, the mutual fund company’s global head of
corporate bond portfolios, said in a  report  today on Pimco’s
website. Technological improvements such as hydraulic
fracturing, or “fracking,” and horizontal drilling have helped
drillers boost gas production, according to Kiesel.  “Onshore natural gas shale and oil shale developments are
creating opportunities to invest in energy companies that may
grow significantly faster than the overall  U.S. economy ,”
Kiesel wrote.  Investors should buy debt issued by energy producers,
pipeline owners and chemical companies, Kiesel said. Pimco, the
 Newport Beach , California-based manager of the world’s largest
 bond fund , has been bullish on the energy sector for about a
decade, he said.  U.S.  oil and gas producers have learned to tap previously
impermeable deposits of oil and gas by fracturing rock with
mixtures of water, sand and chemicals injected under high
pressure. That technique can yield commercial quantities when
combined with horizontal drilling, a lengthwise bore that can
expose a mile or more of gas or oil-bearing rock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
