There were 231 nominations for this
yearâ€™s Nobel Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said.  Of the nominees, 43 were organizations, the Oslo-based
committee said today on its website. A record 247 candidates
were nominated last year, the group said.  Members of national assemblies and governments,
international courts, university rectors, as well as active and
former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee  are among those
who can propose names for the prize. While the Nobel  institute
keeps nominees secret for 50 years, names are sometimes
disclosed by the nominators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
