The European Union tightened
sanctions on  Syria  by freezing the Syrian central bank’s assets
and banning trade in  precious metals  and diamonds with the
country.  EU governments also prohibited Syrian cargo-only flights to
the bloc as part of the tougher penalties against President
Bashar al-Assad’s regime for its continued violent crackdown on
civilian opponents. In addition, they imposed a visa ban and an
asset freeze on seven Syrian ministers.  “Today’s decisions will put further pressure on those who
are responsible for the ruthless campaign of repression in
Syria,” EU foreign-policy chief  Catherine Ashton  said in a
statement in Brussels after her national counterparts in the
bloc endorsed the penalties. “The measures target the regime
and its ability to conduct the appalling violence against
civilians.”  The 27-nation EU’s new penalties, which build on an oil
embargo approved last September, will take effect after being
published tomorrow in the bloc’s  Official Journal . Ashton held
out the possibility of further EU sanctions against Syria,
where, according to television reports, a referendum yesterday
on a new constitution hasn’t interrupted attacks by Syrian
forces.  “As long as the repression continues, the EU will keep
imposing sanctions,” Ashton said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
