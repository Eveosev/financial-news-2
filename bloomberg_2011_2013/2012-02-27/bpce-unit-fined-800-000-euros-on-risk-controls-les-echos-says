Groupe BPCE’s biggest regional
banking unit was fined 800,000 euros ($1.1 million) by French
regulators for inadequate market-risk controls,  Les Echos 
reported, citing unidentified sources.  BRED, a unit of BPCE’s Banque Populaire, introduced
increasingly complex products without beefing up its risk
controls, the regulators found, according to the newspaper
report. The regulators disclosed the penalty on Jan. 2 without
naming the bank that was sanctioned, Les Echos said.  BRED spokeswoman Nathalie Avril wasn’t available for
immediate comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
