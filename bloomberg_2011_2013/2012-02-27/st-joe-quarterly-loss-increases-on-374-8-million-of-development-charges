St. Joe Co. (JOE) , the largest private
land owner in northern  Florida , reported a wider fourth-quarter
loss as it had noncash charges of $374.8 million on developments
planned before the state’s real estate collapse.  The net loss was $328.6 million, or $3.56 a share, compared
with $2.7 million, or 3 cents, a year earlier, the Watersound,
Florida-based company said in a statement today.  St. Joe projected charges of $325 million to $375 million
for the quarter and capital-expenditure savings of $190 million
over the next decade as part of a new strategy “to weather a
tepid and uncertain real estate environment,” according to a
Jan. 27 statement. Its real estate investments were revalued to
$387.2 million as of Dec. 31 from $755.4 million a year earlier,
the company said today.  “We believe that this new investment strategy continues to
build upon the successful cost-reduction initiatives that we
previously implemented and positions us to increase our short-
and medium-term  cash flow , reduce our long-term risk and
maintain our strong cash position,” Chief Executive Officer
Park Brady said in the statement.  St. Joe , originally a forestry-products company founded by
members of the du Pont family who acquired most of its land in
the 1920s and 1930s, now has 573,000 acres (232,000 hectares)
concentrated in northwestern Florida. It diversified into
residential, resort and industrial development in the 1990s.  Almost 23 percent of Florida homes with a mortgage were
delinquent or in foreclosure as of Dec. 31, the most of any
state and higher than the 12 percent U.S. average, according to
 Lender Processing Services Inc. (LPS) , a Jacksonville, Florida-based
real estate data and services company.  St. Joe released fourth-quarter results after the close of
regular U.S. trading. It fell 0.8 percent to $15.97 at the
close. The shares have dropped 40 percent over the last year,
 compared with  a 3 percent increase in the Russell 1000 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
