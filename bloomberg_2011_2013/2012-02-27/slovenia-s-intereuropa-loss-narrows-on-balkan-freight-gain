Intereuropa Group d.d. , Slovenia’s
main freight distribution company, said its loss last year
narrowed as the company transported more cargo in the Balkan
region.  The company’s net loss slimmed to 7.6 million euros ($10
million) from 39.2 million euros a year earlier, Koper-based
 Intereuropa (IEKG)  said in an e-mailed  statement  today. Revenue
advanced 11 percent to 212 million euros, it said.  Intereuropa agreed with its creditor banks to freeze
repayments until end of September as the company seeks to divest
assets and sell property, it said without giving details of the
amount owed.  The company had total debt of 195.4 million euros at the
end of June last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
