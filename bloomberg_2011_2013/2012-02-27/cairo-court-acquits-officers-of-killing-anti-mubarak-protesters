A Cairo court acquitted two police
officers accused of killing demonstrators during last year’s
mass protests that led to the ouster of  Hosni Mubarak ,  Egypt ’s
state-run news agency reported today.  Prosecutors had charged the officers with the murder of two
protesters, the Cairo-based Middle East News Agency said.  In December, a court acquitted five members of the police
of killing protesters during the anti-Mubarak revolt. Today’s
ruling may fuel the anger of activists who have been demanding
punishment for those behind the deaths.  The court trying Mubarak, accused of complicity in the
killing of some of the protesters, is due to issue its verdict
on June 2. At least 846 people were killed during the revolt
that ended his rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
