Colombia ’s peso bonds gained,
sending yields on benchmark securities to a one-week low, after
the central bank raised  interest rates  to cool the fastest
expansion since 2006 and keep inflation in check.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso bonds due
July 2024 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
7.35 percent, according to the central bank. That’s the lowest
level on a closing basis since Feb. 17. The price rose 0.147
centavo to 121.026 centavos per peso.  Banco de la Republica on Feb. 24 raised the overnight
lending rate a quarter percentage point to 5.25 percent, as
forecast by 22 of 36 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That’s
the ninth increase since January 2011 as the expansion threatens
to quicken annual inflation from 3.54 percent in January.  “Bonds are reacting to the bank’s rate increase,” said
Daniel Velandia, head analyst at Correval SA brokerage in
Bogota. “For now it seems inflation expectations are easing.
We’ll have to wait and see how inflation behaves this month.”  Policy makers said in their statement on Feb. 24 that they
anticipate the rate increases will help drive investors’
inflation expectations to the mid-point of the 2 percent to 4
percent target range.  The peso gained, erasing an earlier drop. It rose 0.2
percent to 1,772.01 per  U.S. dollar . It touched 1,765.80 on Feb.
24, the strongest intraday level since Aug. 17. The currency has
advanced 9.4 percent this year.  The central bank also said Feb. 24 that it will prolong
daily dollar purchases as it seeks to ease the currency’s rally.
Banco de la Republica will extend the program of daily purchases
of a minimum of $20 million in auctions begun Feb. 6 to at least
Aug. 4. The bank had initially said the program would last at
least three months.  “The central bank’s intervention is moderating the peso’s
strengthening trend as it reduces the attractiveness” of
betting the peso will gain in the short term, Velandia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
