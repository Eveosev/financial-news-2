Portugal ’s Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said his nation will manage a turnaround as the
continuing implementation of economic reforms reestablishes
confidence in the country and makes Portugal a competitive
economy, according to a commentary he wrote in  Handelsblatt .  So far, Portugal has achieved all the requirements that
were part of its aid package from the European Union, Gaspar
said, adding that the economy shrank less than forecast last
year while the budget deficit was smaller than planned, he wrote
in the commentary in today’s edition of the German newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
