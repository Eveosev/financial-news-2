Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the world’s largest
offshore-rig operator, reported a fourth-quarter loss after the
company’s contract-drilling business lost market value,
resulting in a writedown.  Transocean posted a loss of $6.12 billion, or $18.62 a
share, from a loss of $799 million, or $2.51, a year earlier,
the Vernier, Switzerland-based company said in a statement
today. The company was expected to earn 19 cents a share, the
average of 19 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The writedown, in addition to a $1 billion reserve for BP
Plc’s Macondo oil spill and other one-time items, reduced profit
by $18.80. Excluding these items, the company reported a profit
of 18 cents, three cents less than the average of 32 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 14 percent to
$2.42 billion in the quarter.  “It’s a sloppy quarter,” said James C. West, an analyst
at  Barclays Capital  in  New York  who rates the shares
“overweight” and owns none. “If you back out everything, the
quarter actually looks OK operationally.”  Operating profit margin of 35.4 percent were better than
expected,  Brian Uhlmer , an analyst at Global Hunter Securities
LLC in Houston, who rates the shares “neutral” and owns none,
said in an interview. Uhlmer expected margins of 32.9 percent.  Contract drilling is Transocean’s largest business unit and
accounted for 92 percent of revenue in the fourth quarter.  An
annual test of the unit’s value prompted the company to take the
writedown.  Macondo Settlement  Transocean rose 5.3 percent to $53.43 at the close in New
York, the most since Oct. 10.  “The fourth quarter’s results provide hope that a new era
is just over the horizon,”  Scott Gruber , an analyst at  Sanford
Bernstein  in New York, said in a note to investors today. The $1
billion Macondo-related charge is below the $5 billion in losses
that the stock appears to imply, he wrote.  Transocean owned the $365 million Deepwater Horizon rig
that was destroyed in the BP oil spill in the Gulf. The company
employed nine of the 11 workers who died in the April 2010
disaster.  “If they could settle for $1 billion, I think people would
be pretty happy,” Luke Lemoine, an analyst at Capital One
Southcoast in  New Orleans , who rates the shares am “add” and
owns none.  Transocean lowered its forecast for operating expenses in
2012 to a range of $6.15 billion to $6.35 billion, according to
the statement. Previously, Transocean forecast a range of $6.2
billion to $6.5 billion, Lemoine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
