Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL) , the oil-rig operator
whose largest owner is billionaire John Fredricksen, will take a
$463 million non-cash impairment charge on its investment in
 Archer Ltd. (ARCHER)  for the fourth quarter of 2011.  Archer contributed $44 million to net income for the full
year, reflecting “deconsolidation profits” and the impairment
charge, Seadrill said in a statement. The Hamilton, Bermuda-
based rig company will release quarterly results on Feb. 29.  Archer shares have fallen 58 percent in 12 months, eroding
the value of Seadrill’s 39.94 percent stake in the oilfield-
services provider. The slump coincides with a push by Archer’s
Chief Executive Officer Jorgen Rasmussen to make acquisitions,
including Great White Energy Services Inc. last August.  “Seadrill is, as a major long-term owner, clearly
disappointed in the recent developments in Archer,” the company
said in today’s statement. Seadrill expects management changes
to drive a recovery in Archer’s share price, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
