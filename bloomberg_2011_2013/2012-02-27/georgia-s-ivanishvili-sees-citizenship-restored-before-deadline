Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, who’s challenging the rule of President Mikheil Saakashvili, may regain the citizenship he lost in October
before an April 5 deadline to decide on his case, his lawyer
Zakharia Kutsnashvili said.  “We expect restoration of his citizenship sooner than in
April as the conclusions from the relevant ministries should
come through this month,” Kutsnashvili said today by phone from
the capital, Tbilisi. “Ivanishvili’s political life has been
terribly damaged by the five months of waiting.”  The Justice Ministry will decide on the case as soon as all
the necessary documents have been examined, spokeswoman Khatuna
Iosava said today by phone, without elaborating.  Ivanishvili, whose wealth Forbes magazine estimated in
March 2011 at $5.5 billion, has created a political party to
contest parliamentary elections in October. He renounced his
Russian citizenship and said Dec. 29 that he’d also give up his
French citizenship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
