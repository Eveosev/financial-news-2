The cost of insuring Australia
corporate bonds from non-payment rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 1 basis point to 144
basis points as of 11:18 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC)  That would be the highest level since Feb. 23,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index was unchanged at 142 basis
points as of 9:17 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche Bank AG
prices. Japanâ€™s contracts fell to its lowest level since Aug. 18
last week, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was unchanged at 164 basis points as of
8:26 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
