Rambus Inc. (RMBS) , a designer of computer
memory chips, said Chief Executive Officer Harold Hughes will
retire and that he’ll remain at the helm until a successor is
appointed.  The search is under way for an executive to replace Hughes,
66, Sunnyvale, California-based Rambus said in a statement
today.  The former Intel Corp. executive has led Rambus through
some of its toughest legal disputes with larger companies in the
computer memory business. The company has attempted to assert
ownership of technology at the heart of all of the chips made in
the $29 billion dynamic random access memory industry.  “Rambus is on a strong path as a result of our
diversification strategy and recent license agreements with key
 semiconductor companies ,” Hughes said in the statement. “Given
this, I have decided it is time to start the process of
identifying my successor and help the company move into the next
phase.”  Rambus shares plunged 61 percent on Nov. 16, for their
biggest one-day decline since the company sold shares in 1997,
after the company lost a $3.95 billion  jury trial  over
allegations that Micron Technology Inc. and Hynix Semiconductor
Inc. conspired to prevent Rambus chips from becoming an
industry standard. Earlier this month, Rambus signed a licensing
deal with Nvidia Corp.  Rambus shares fell 1.3 percent to $7.42 at the close in  New
York , before the retirement announcement. They have dropped 65
percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
