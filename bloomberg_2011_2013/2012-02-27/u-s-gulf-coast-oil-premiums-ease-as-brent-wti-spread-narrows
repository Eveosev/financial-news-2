U.S. Gulf Coast oils narrowed their
premiums to West Texas Intermediate as the spread between WTI
and Brent crude narrowed.  Brent’s premium to WTI narrowed 27 cents to $15.43 a barrel
at 5:01 p.m. in  New York , based on futures contracts for April
delivery. The spread has narrowed 25 percent since Feb. 7, when
it rose to $20.70 in intraday trading, the widest since Oct. 24.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE) ’s premium to the U.S. benchmark
narrowed $3 to $18.50 a barrel at 4.03 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium dropped $3.95 to $16.70 a
barrel. The grade switched to April delivery from March starting
today, which may have distorted the differentials, said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI narrowed $2 to $16 and Mars
Blend’s widened 15 cents to $13.05.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium widened
10 cents to $12.35 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN) ’s premium
narrowed $1 to $12.25 a barrel over WTI.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount narrowed $1.50 to $3.50 a
barrel.  The discount for  Syncrude (USCSSYNS)  against futures was unchanged at
$13.25 a barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil
derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount was unchanged at $28.50 a
barrel.  Bakken (USCSUHC1)  oil’s discount narrowed $1 to $14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
