Fiera Sceptre Inc. (FSZ) , a Montreal-based
money manager, agreed to buy Natcan Investment Management from
 National Bank of Canada  for C$309.5 million ($308.4 million) in
cash and stock to increase assets under management.  Fiera  will pay C$235 million when the deal is completed and
another C$74.5 million “over time,” the company said today in
a statement. National Bank will hold a 35 percent stake in the
unit.  Fiera said the purchase from Canada’s sixth-largest bank
will bring its assets to about C$54 billion and make it one of
the five largest independent asset managers in Canada. National
Bank said the transaction will be “neutral” to its earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
