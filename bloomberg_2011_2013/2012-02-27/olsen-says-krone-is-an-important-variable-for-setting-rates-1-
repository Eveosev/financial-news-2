Norges Bank Governor Oeystein Olsen
said policy makers take foreign exchange movements into account
when setting rates as they affect the pace of inflation.  The krone is an “important variable” and currently
“strong,” he said in a speech today in Moss,  Norway .  The krone, this month’s best performing major currency
against both the dollar and the euro, fell 0.3 percent to 7.5167
per euro and lost 0.8 percent to 5.6207 per dollar as of 3:44
p.m. in Oslo.  The central bank in December lowered its main rate by half
a percentage point to 1.75 percent, its biggest cut since May
2009, to avoid excessive krone gains and guard against the
fallout of  Europe ’s debt crisis. The currency last week touched
its highest level since February 2003, as investors fled the
debt-plagued euro area and flocked to Norway’s AAA rated assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
