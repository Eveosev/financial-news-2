The U.S. Treasury Department today
asked for information about positions in 1.25 percent notes of
January 2019, with a threshold of $2 billion as of the close of
business on Feb. 21.  “Entities with reportable positions in this note equal to
or exceeding the $2 billion threshold must report these
positions to the  Federal Reserve  Bank of  New York ,” the
Treasury said in a press release.  Reports are due by March 2 and must include the required
position and administration information, the Treasury said.
Central banks and the Federal Reserve are exempt from these
requests.  The large position reporting program was established in
1996 to guard against market manipulation. In December 2010, the
Treasury announced a test of the program and called for reports
from investors holding $2 billion or more of 3/4-percent
Treasury notes maturing on Sept. 15, 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
