European stocks  declined, extending
last week’s retreat, as the Group of 20 nations rejected calls
from the euro area to increase the International Monetary Fund’s
lending resources.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  lost 3.7 percent after pretax profit at
 Europe ’s largest bank missed analysts’ estimates. A.P. Moeller-
 Maersk (MAERSKB)  A/S slipped 3.7 percent after saying that its container
division will make a loss this year. Airlines fell as crude oil
traded near a nine-month high.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  slid 0.3 percent to 263.86 at
the close, after earlier falling as much as 1.2 percent. The
benchmark measure extended last week’s 0.4 percent retreat. The
gauge has still  climbed 7.9 percent  this year buoyed by U.S.
economic reports and as investors speculated that the euro area
will contain its sovereign-debt crisis.  “I don’t think the market really anticipated the G-20
would come up with anything different,” said Jeremy Batstone- Carr, head of research at Charles Stanley & Co. in  London . “The
fact of that matter is -- as it stands -- the firewall is still
insufficient. The higher oil price is another uncertainty in
investors’ minds and it is contributing to this slightly risk-
off day today.”  G-20 officials told the euro area’s political leaders to
provide more financial firepower before they consider lending
their support, putting the onus on Germany, already the biggest
national contributor to the bailouts.  Germany went to the Mexico meetings of finance ministers
and central bankers urging G-20 nations to find further money
that the IMF could channel to the euro area.  IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde , who attended the
talks, said she wants to increase the fund’s lending capacity by
$500 billion so that it can fend off “further shocks” to the
global economy.  Germany’s Bailout Vote  Germany ’s parliament approved the second Greek aid package
in Berlin today after the close of equity markets. The country’s
government must decide whether to back plans at a March 1-2
European Union summit to combine rescue funds for the euro area
and produce a potential firewall of 750 billion euros ($1
trillion).  Chancellor Angela Merkel today said there remained no need
to increase the lending capacity of the euro area’s bailout
mechanisms, citing lower borrowing costs for the currency
region’s most-indebted members.  National benchmark indexes fell in 13 of the 17 western-
European markets that were open today.  France ’s CAC 40 Index
fell 0.7 percent, Germany’s DAX Index lost 0.2 percent and the
U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index slid 0.3 percent.  Earnings Season  Seventy-seven companies on the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  are scheduled to
report financial results this week, including eight today. Of
the 214 that have reported quarterly  earnings  so far, 108 have
missed analysts’ estimates, while 94 have beaten them, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  HSBC fell 3.7 percent to 553.5 pence, the biggest
contribution to the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP) ’s retreat, after reporting a 15
percent increase in pretax profit to $21.9 billion last year.
That missed the $22.3 billion  median analyst estimate . Chief
Executive Officer  Stuart Gulliver  told reporters the lender
remained “confident” of hitting its 12 percent return-on-
equity target by 2013.  Maersk (MAERSKB)  slid 3.7 percent to 43,840 kroner after the shipping
company posted a 43 percent drop in 2011 profit to 15.2 billion
kroner ($2.7 billion). That compared with the  average analyst
estimate  of 14.8 billion kroner. Falling freight rates pushed
its container line to a loss in 2011. The company said that the
division will also lose money in 2012.  Air France, Lufthansa  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group dropped 2.5 percent to 4.35 euros as
crude oil traded near a nine-month high of $109.77 a barrel in
 New York .  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  lost 2.4 percent to 10.17 euros
and Ryanair Holdings Plc slid 1.4 percent to 4.04 euros.  Prices gained the most in two months last week as sanctions
tightened against  Iran , OPEC’s second-biggest producer. The
contract for April delivery fell as much as 1.4 percent to
$108.24 a barrel today as investors speculated that prices may
have climbed too far.  Carnival Plc, the world’s largest cruise-line owner,
declined 1.7 percent to 1,841 pence. The shares extended losses
after the Italian Coast Guard said a fire aboard Costa Crociere
SpA’s cruise ship Costa Allegra had been extinguished and all
the passengers were safe.  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR)  tumbled 15 percent to 107.6 pence after
the Indian power producer and oil refiner said it made a  loss
after taxes  of $568 million in 2011 after the  Supreme Court  of
 India  overturned a decision to defer payment of sales taxes.  Associated British Foods Plc (ABF)  fell 1.6 percent to 1,200
pence after the world’s second-biggest sugar producer forecast
that first-half profit will exceed the previous year.  Nokia Shares Tumble  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  sank 6.1 percent to 4.06 euros after the world’s
 third-largest smartphone maker  by shipments revealed its latest
devices at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, including the
Lumia 610. The shares rallied 5.6 percent on Feb. 24 after the
company said it would announce “significant industry news” at
the MWC.  Porsche SE rallied 3.1 percent to 50.07 euros after people
familiar with the matter said  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe’s largest
carmaker , is close to a deal to purchase the 50.1 percent stake
in Porsche’s automotive business that it doesn’t already own.
The company may announce a plan within the next two weeks, said
the people who declined to be identified.  BP Plc (BP/)  added 1.1 percent to 501.7 pence. Europe’s second-
largest crude producer and plaintiffs suing over the 2010 Gulf
of Mexico oil spill have discussed a $14 billion accord that the
company would fund with money originally set aside for out-of-
court settlements, said three people familiar with the talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
