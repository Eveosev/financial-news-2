Jerry Sandusky, the former
 Pennsylvania  State University assistant football coach accused
of sexually abusing boys, asked a judge to delay his trial until
mid-July from May, saying prosecutors don’t object.  Joseph Amendola, a lawyer for Sandusky, submitted the
request today, citing the volume of work to be done in
preparation for his defense and the number of potential
witnesses to be located and interviewed, according to court
papers filed in state court in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania.  Private investigators “will need a substantial amount of
time to locate and interview these witnesses, especially given
the fact the Commonwealth has redacted the addresses and phone
numbers of these individuals,” Amendola said in the court
filing.  Sandusky, 68, a former defensive coordinator for  Penn
State ’s football team, is charged with more than 50 counts
stemming from the alleged abuse of boys during a 15-year period.
Sandusky, who has denied the charges, had been scheduled to go
on trial in May.  In addition to locating witnesses, Amendola said in the
filing that he expects to issue a number of subpoenas to various
agencies and individuals to produce records relating to
Sandusky’s cases. He didn’t identify the agencies or
individuals.  Amendola said in the filing that prosecutors don’t object
to the request for a continuance.  The Sandusky case is  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  v.
Sandusky, CP-14-2422-2011, Court of Common Pleas, Centre County,
Pennsylvania (Bellefonte)  To contact the reporter on this story:
