The ruble appreciated to its
strongest level in almost six months as companies sought the
local currency to pay taxes and oil,  Russia ’s biggest export
earner, traded near the highest since 2008. Eurobonds climbed,
pushing yields to record lows.  The Russian currency gained 0.5 percent to 29.035 per
dollar at the close in Moscow, its strongest level since Sept.1
and extending last week’s 2.5 percent advance. The yield on
Russia’s $3.5 billion of bonds due 2020 dropped six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.991 percent, the lowest
since they were sold in April 2010.  Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, slid 0.9 percent
to $123.91 a barrel, dropping from the strongest level since
July 2008 on bets gains were overdone. Russian companies are due
to pay about 400 billion rubles ($14 billion) today and tomorrow
in mineral extraction and profit tax, according to Nikolay Podguzov, head of fixed-income strategy at VTB Capital in
Moscow.  “Oil is only marginally lower,” he said today by e-mail.
“The ruble is supported by high  oil prices  and stronger demand
for liquidity.”  The ruble added 0.8 percent to 38.875 per euro, the
strongest since July 2010, and 0.7 percent to 33.463 against the
central bank’s target euro-dollar basket. Investors pared bets
the ruble will weaken, with non-deliverable forwards showing the
Russian currency at 29.4093 per dollar in three months, compared
with expectations of 29.5295 per dollar yesterday.  Repurchase Auction  Banks sought 5.3 billion rubles of the 120 billion-ruble of
one-day funds offered by the central bank in repurchase auctions
today. “It looks like banks preferred not to tap the central
bank’s refinancing facility, but to sell hard currency into the
rally,” Podguzov said.  Bank Rossii manages the ruble within a so-called “floating
corridor” against a basket of dollars and euros to limit swings
that erode exporters’ competitiveness. The central bank may be
buying as much as $250 million a day in foreign currencies to
slow the ruble’s advance after it passed through 33.87 against
the basket last week, Podguzov said.  Russia’s $2 billion of Eurobonds due 2015 rose, pushing the
yield down eight basis points to 2.365 percent, the lowest since
they were sold in April 2010. Dollar bonds due in 2015 from OAO
Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, yielded eight basis points
less than Feb. 24 at 3.898 percent, while the yield on similar-
maturity notes issued by state gas monopoly OAO Gazprom dropped
15 basis points to 3.726 percent, the lowest since August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
