U.K. house prices held their value
for a second month in February, boosted by a seasonal increase
in demand and a rush to beat the expiration of a property-tax
exemption, Hometrack Ltd. said.  The average cost of a home in England and  Wales  was
unchanged from January and 1.4 percent lower than a year
earlier, the London-based property research company said in a
report today. The number of potential buyers registering with
estate agents rose 18 percent over the month, the largest gain
for five years.  The figures partly reflect people looking to take advantage
of a two-year  stamp-duty exemption  for first-time buyers
purchasing a home for less than 250,000 pounds ($396,000) before
it ends next month. Hometrack said the supply-demand balance
suggests property prices will resume their decline in the coming
months as banks restrict lending and Britons are squeezed by
government budget cuts and rising  unemployment .  “While the seasonal pickup in demand is to be welcomed,
the fundamentals facing the housing market remain largely
unchanged,”  Richard Donnell , Hometrack’s director of research,
said in the report. “In the short term, a lack of housing for
sale is set to underpin prices while market activity will
benefit from the support of first-time buyers as they race to
beat the ending of the stamp-duty holiday.”  Home values declined in six out of the 10 regions tracked
by Hometrack this month, while three areas were little changed
and  London  posted a “small increase,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
