Retail gasoline would need crude oil
to extend its 11 percent surge in the two weeks ended Feb. 24 in
order to reach $4 a gallon, according to gasoline analyst  Trilby Lundberg .  The average price for regular gasoline at U.S. filling
stations rose 18.16 cents to $3.6917 a gallon in the two weeks
ended Feb. 24, according to Lundberg Survey Inc. In that same
period, West Texas Intermediate crude jumped $11.10 a barrel
while London benchmark Brent oil increased $8.16, Lundberg,
president of Lundberg Survey, said today in a telephone
interview.  “The momentum suggests we can’t be assured of a $4 price
this spring, and gasoline can’t do it on its own because demand
is still poor and supplies are ample, Lundberg said. ‘‘To move
another 31 cents to $4, it would take a crude oil price increase
larger than what we have seen.”  April-delivery WTI fell for the first time in eight days
today, dropping $1.21 to $108.56 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  after reaching a nine-month high on Feb. 24.  Gasoline is 51.26 cents higher than a year ago, Lundberg
said. If crude prices stay at this level, gasoline could rise
another 5 to 8 cents in the next two weeks, she said. The
Camarillo, California-based company surveys about 2,500
stations.  In 2011, prices peaked at $4 a gallon on May 6 and then
finished the year 76 cents lower. Between 1999 and 2011, the
average price rose 44.1 cents a gallon between January and June,
Lundberg said Feb. 17. Prices tend to rise in the spring because
of seasonal demand and the higher cost of refining summer-grade
gasoline.  Gasoline Stockpiles  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  declined 649,000 barrels to 231.5
million in the week ended Feb. 17, according to the Energy
Department. Supplies, which have gained 13 percent since Nov. 4,
are 2.8 percent below a year earlier.  Deliveries to wholesalers  rose 5.6 percent to 8.63 million
barrels a day during the period, the highest level in eight
weeks. Demand during the four weeks ended Feb. 17 was 6.1
percent below a year earlier.  Lundberg said in a Feb. 17 report that the average price
for 2012 will be $3.50 for regular grade, 2 cents lower than in
2011. She said today that she has not updated that report since
the recent rise in crude prices.  “The logic holds but it can’t be known what crude will
do,” Lundberg said.  Price Outlook  The Energy Department, in its Feb. 6 Short Term Energy
Outlook, projected that gasoline prices will average $3.55 this
year, 2 cents higher than 2011. Prices will average about 7
cents higher during the April-through-September peak driving
season. There is about a one-in-four chance the average will
exceed $4 in June, the report said.  The highest price in the lower 48 states among the cities
surveyed was in  San Diego  at $4.24 a gallon. The lowest price
was in Denver where prices averaged $3.07 a gallon.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline sold for $3.91 a gallon.
Los Angeles-area retail stations average $4.22 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
