Solarhybrid AG (SHL) , a German developer
of solar energy projects, fell to its lowest value in two years
in Frankfurt trading on government plans to eliminate support
for large-scale solar  power plants .  Solarhybrid fell 13 percent to 4.19 euros a share, its
third day of losses and the lowest closing price since March 3,
2010, after  Germany ’s Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen said
last week he plans to eliminate state support for solar plants
bigger than 10 megawatts after July 1.  Solarhybrid, based in Brilon, developed six large-scale
plants in Germany last year, including the 60.4-megawatt
FinowTower II project, according to its  website . It has since
focused on growing its business abroad by purchasing project
rights in Israel and the U.S.  Germany, the world’s biggest solar market by total
capacity, plans to cut aid to the industry by as much as 29
percent from March 9 and further scale back subsidies each
month, beginning in May, Roettgen said on Feb. 23. The cuts are
deeper than the 15 percent reduction ordered Jan. 1 and may hurt
manufacturers in Germany and  China , where the world’s three
largest panel makers are based.  To contact the reporter on this story:
