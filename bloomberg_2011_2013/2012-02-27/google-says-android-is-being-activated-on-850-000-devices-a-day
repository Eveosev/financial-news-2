Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android software, the
world’s most popular smartphone operating system, is being
activated on 850,000 new devices a day, up from 700,000 in
December.  The total number of Android devices has topped 300 million,
 Andy Rubin , Google’s senior vice president in charge of mobile
and digital content, said in a blog posting. The company also
plans to maintain a “firewall” between Android development and
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc., which Google is buying for
$12.5 billion, Rubin said at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona,
