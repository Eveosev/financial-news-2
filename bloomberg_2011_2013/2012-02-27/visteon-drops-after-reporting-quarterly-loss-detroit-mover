Visteon Corp. (VC) , the auto-parts maker
shopping two of its four units to focus on faster-growing
operations in  Asia , slid as much as 3.6 percent after reporting
a quarterly loss when analysts estimated a profit.  Visteon fell 0.6 percent to $53.23 at 10:35 a.m. New York
time, after reaching $51.65, the biggest decline since Jan. 11.
Before today, the shares gained 7.2 percent this year after
falling 33 percent in 2011.  Visteon reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $26 million,
or 51 cents a share, compared with a year-ago profit of $86
million, or $1.66 a share. The quarter included a $66 million
noncash writedown of Visteonâ€™s lighting unit, the company said
in a regulatory  filing . Excluding the writedown, the average
estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit
of 79 cents a share.  Visteon is in talks with Varroc Group of  India  about a sale
of the unit, three people familiar with the sales process said
Feb. 17. The unit may sell for less than its net worth, the
people said at that time. Visteon, which exited bankruptcy in
2010 after 16 months, wants to divest its lighting and interiors
units to other suppliers, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the plans are private.  Sales fell 1.5 percent to $1.86 billion. The company, based
in  Van Buren Township ,  Michigan , on Oct. 31 sold a part of its
stake in Duckyang Industry Co., an interiors joint venture, and
it no longer had a controlling interest. That move decreased
fourth-quarter sales by $83 million. The average estimate of
three analysts was for sales of $1.89 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
