Gedeon Richter Nyrt. (RICHT) , Hungary’s
largest drugmaker, said its Esmya drug received marketing
authorization by the European Union for the pre-operative
treatment of myomas.  “We see Esmya’s annual sales peaking at around 100 million
euros ($134.3 million) after an introductory period of three
years,” Zsuzsa Beke, Richter’s communications director, said in
a phone interview. The market introduction of the new drug will
be gradual, with sales scheduled to start in  Germany  and the
U.K. in April 2012, she said.  Esmya was developed by PregLem, a Swiss biopharmaceutical
company wholly owned by Richter, according to a statement
published on the  website  of the Budapest Stock Exchange today.  Richter, central and eastern  Europe ’s largest producer of
gynecological products, got Esmya in 2010 when it bought
 Switzerland ’s PregLem for 445 million Swiss francs ($496
million). The medicine may be the first of a new type of
treatment for uterine fibroids, or myomas, which affect about 40
percent of women between the age of 35 and 55 and can cause
heavy bleeding, pain and infertility.  “This is particularly good news and it’s the first big
step toward Richter becoming a leading global drugmaker,” Erste
Bank AG said in an e-mailed research note today.  License Fee  Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. agreed in 2010 to pay Richter a
$17 million license fee to develop and market Esmya in the U.S.
and  Canada . Richter faces a milestone payment of around 150
million Swiss francs for Esmya, Beke said.  Richter  shares  rose as much as 0.5 percent to 38,190 forint
and were trading at 38,100 at 09:41 a.m. in Budapest,
outperforming the benchmark  BUX index , which declined 0.7
percent. The stock has advanced 11.4 percent this year.  Sales of Esmya may start in Spain and  Italy  in 2013 while
roll-out to central and eastern European markets as well as
former Soviet states hinges on the registration process, Beke
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
