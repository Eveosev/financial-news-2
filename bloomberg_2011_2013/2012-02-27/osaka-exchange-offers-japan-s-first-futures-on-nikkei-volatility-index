The Osaka Securities Exchange Co.
started offering Nikkei 225 Volatility Index  futures  today, the
first exchange-traded Japanese securities that allow investors
to hedge against swings in the stock market.  The futures on the volatility index, a measure of expected
movement in stocks over the next 30 days, began trading a week
after Hong Kong’s exchange started offering similar products. At
the 3:10 p.m. close, 49 contracts expiring March 13 worth 10,000
yen ($123) each had changed hands at the Osaka bourse.  Stock volatility futures have been traded on public
exchanges in the U.S. since 2004. They were created as
alternatives to derivatives that allow investors to take a
position on the direction of the market with a bank or dealer.  “This is clearly a good opportunity for volatility
players,” Cedric Dechavanne, a Hong Kong-based equity
derivatives strategist for Societe Generale SA, told Bloomberg
News. “Growing demand for tail risk hedging coupled with
investors’ willingness to invest in transparent and listed
products has pushed volume on European and US futures on
volatility indexes higher.”  The securities  surged in popularity  after the 2008
financial crisis, when investors sought to hedge against large
market swings.  The Nikkei volatility index was created by Nikkei Inc. and
Nomura Securities Co.’s Quantitative Research Center. The Osaka
exchange began calculating the index in November 2010, according
to a  statement  from Nikkei .   The  index rose  3.7 percent to 21.60 today, indicating
investors expect to see a 6.2 percent swing in the Nikkei 225
Stock Average in the next 30 days.  Since the Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. began
offering futures on the HSI Volatility Index last week, 28
 contracts  have changed hands, with each worth HK$5,000 ($645).  To contact the reporter on this story:
