Asian  stocks  climbed as oil headed
for a second day of decline, easing concern that high prices
might crimp global demand, and as Chinese banks rose after a
report they are allowed to keep lending to local governments.  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) , a South Korean chipmaker, gained
6.8 percent, the biggest gain in the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP) , as
Japan’s  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665)  filed for bankruptcy. Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd., Hong Kong’s biggest carrier, rose 5.7 percent as
oil slid further from a nine-month high.  China  Construction Bank
Co. climbed 1.1 percent in Hong Kong. Japanese exporters dropped
as gains in the yen cut their earnings outlook.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.6 percent, to 128.11
as of 5:20 p.m. in Tokyo, with about three stocks rising for
each that fell. The measure, which last retreated for two
consecutive days on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6, erased a decline of as
much as 0.3 percent. It is within 1 percent of completing a 20
percent advance from its October low.  “Investors’ desire to buy stocks is quite strong at the
moment, so when stocks fall a little, people are rushing to buy
them,” said  Hideyuki Suzuki , general manager of investment
market research department, SBI Securities Co. “ Hong Kong  and
India are rising strongly so that’s also improving the
investors’ sentiment.”  The Asia-Pacific gauge last week completed a 10-week
winning streak, the longest such run of gains since its
inception in 1988, amid signs of U.S. economic recovery and
China’s monetary easing.  Japan Small Caps  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.9 percent after
slipping 1.1 percent. The yen appreciated to as high as 80.02
against the dollar. Against the euro, Japan’s currency
strengthened to 107.19 from 109.13. A stronger yen cuts overseas
income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ,
a carmaker that gets more than 80 percent of its revenue
overseas, lost 0.8 percent in Tokyo.  A gauge of  smaller companies  on the Tokyo bourse’s second
section fell 0.1 percent, ending a 30-day, record stretch of
gains since 1961.  South Korea’s  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index rose 0.6 percent, led by
chipmaking rivals of Elpida. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell
0.1 percent, erasing earlier gains.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 12 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 8.8 percent advance by the
 S&P 500  and a 7.9 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.8 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.1 times for the
S&P 500 and 11 times for the Stoxx 600.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.3 percent
today. The index rose 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday on
better-than-estimated housing data and as financial shares
rallied.  Elpida Going Under  Elpida filed for Japan’s biggest bankruptcy in two years
yesterday after semiconductor prices plunged and it failed to
win a second government bailout.  Hynix jumped 6.8 percent to 29,850 won in Seoul. Samsung
Electronics Co., South Korea’s No. 1 consumer electronics
exporter, rose 1.2 percent to 1.185 million won.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  climbed 1.7 percent and the
Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.2 percent. The China Banking
Regulatory Commission has allowed banks to continue lending to
local government financing vehicles for land reserves and road
construction, China Securities Journal reports today, citing a
meeting.  China Construction Bank, the world’s No. 2 lender by market
value, rose 1.9 percent to HK$6.50. Industrial & Commercial Bank
of China Ltd., the biggest, added 2.7 percent to HK$5.62.  Crude Retreats  Oil dropped for a second day in New York as investors bet
that rising U.S. stockpiles signal easing fuel demand amid
prices near the highest level in nine months. Oil for April
delivery fell as much as 72 cents to $107.84 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and was
at $108.44 at 3:06 p.m. Singapore time. The contract yesterday
slid 1.1 percent to $108.56, snapping the longest winning streak
since January 2010.  Cathay Pacific rose 5.7 percent to HK$14.88 after the
Standard newspaper reported the airline already has 1,000
bookings for its new premium economy service. Reliance
Industries Ltd., an Indian company that gets more than 90
percent of revenue from oil refining and petrochemical products,
added 1.5 percent to 793.2 rupees in Mumbai. Tata Motors Ltd.,
the largest truckmaker and owner of Jaguar Land Rover, increased
4.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
