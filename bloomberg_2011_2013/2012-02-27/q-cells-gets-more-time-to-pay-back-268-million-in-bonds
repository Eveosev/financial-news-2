Q-Cells SE (QCE) , once the world’s largest
solar-cell maker, rose the most in almost three weeks in
 Frankfurt  after the German company won more time to pay back
about 200 million euros ($269 million) of bonds.  Q-Cells climbed 3.3 percent to 31.4 euro cents a share, its
biggest one-day jump since Feb. 8. Creditors supported a company
proposal to defer the maturity of the debt to April 30 from
today, the Thalheim-based company said in a statement late
yesterday.  “This agreement, backed by 80 percent of creditors, means
that Q-Cells has taken the first major hurdle to restructure,”
Katharina Cholewa, an analyst at WestLB, said by phone today.
“While the shares may move, it shouldn’t be a lasting upside
because of the huge dilution effect of the planned debt-to-
equity swap.”  Germany ’s solar manufacturers are under pressure from
Chinese competitors that have boosted capacity even as
international prices slumped, while facing a record cut to solar
subsidies next month. Berlin-based module maker  Solon SE (SOO1)  and
 Solar Millennium AG (S2M) , with headquarters in Erlangen, filed for
insolvency in December.  Q-Cells had a record surge in Frankfurt trading on Feb. 1
after saying it reached an agreement “in principle” with the
main holders of its 2012, 2014 and 2015 convertible bonds to
complete a one-step debt restructuring. The bondholders, mainly
institutional investors, will be able to swap their debt for 95
percent of equity, the company said.  Q-Cells, which forecast operating losses through 2013 on
Jan. 24, has lost 39 percent of its market value this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
