Repsol YPF SA (REP) , Spain’s  largest 
energy company, and partners including crude producer  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  said they made a discovery off  Brazil  that
contains at least 250 million barrels of oil.  “The well known as Pao de Acucar drilled into a
hydrocarbons column of 500 metres, one of the thickest
discovered in Brazil to date,” Repsol, which owns 35 percent of
the project and operates it through a joint venture with  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , said today in an e-mailed statement.
 Statoil ASA (STL)  also owns 35 percent and Petrobras the remainder.  The Pao de Acucar well is located in the Campos Basin about
195 kilometers (121.2 miles) off the coast of  Rio de Janeiro  in
2,800 meters (9186.8 feet) of water. The find is the latest in
the so-called pre-salt, an area holding billions of barrels of
oil trapped under a layer of salt in ultra-deep waters.  The well is “high-impact,” meaning it holds 250 million
barrels of oil equivalent or more, Statoil said.  Two of Brazil’s 10 most productive wells in December pumped
oil from discoveries in the Campos pre-salt area, according to
the country’s oil regulator. Oil companies produced 200,600
barrels a day of oil and natural gas from pre-salt fields in
Campos and the neighboring Santos basin in December, or 7.5
percent of Brazil’s total output, according to the regulator.  “The Pao de Acucar well encountered two pre-salt
accumulations,” Statoil said. “A test performed in a partial
section of the pay zone flowed 5,000 barrels per day,”
according to the statement.  Repsol Rises  Repsol rose 0.5 percent to close at 20.73 euros in Madrid.
Statoil rose 1.9 percent, to close at 160.1 kroner in Oslo.  Petrobras is digging deeper in Brazil’s offshore Campos
Basin to find deposits beneath existing fields and trapped under
a layer of salt. Petrobras is using existing platforms to
produce oil from the pre-salt in Campos, where it has extracted
crude since the late 1970s.  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  and  OGX Petroleo e Gas
Participacoes SA (OGXP3)  are among companies that have also discovered
pre-salt oil. Anadarko discovered the Wahoo and Itaipu fields in
Campos with a combined potential of at least 500 million barrels
of oil equivalent, while OGX found oil in a pre-salt well in
Santos earlier this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
