Hisense Electric Co. (600060)  and  Sichuan
Changhong Electric Co. (600839)  led gains in Chinese home appliance
makers, bolstered by speculation the nation’s government may
roll out stimulus measures to boost purchases of electronics.  Hisense (600060)  climbed 9.9 percent to 19.66 yuan, the stock’s
highest closing price since its listing in  Shanghai  in April
1997.  Sichuan Changhong (600839)  advanced by the 10 percent daily limit,
its biggest gain since September 2008, to 2.72 yuan.  China ’s
benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose  0.3 percent .  Investors are anticipating the government will introduce
measures that encourage purchases of home appliances after an
earlier program giving shoppers as much as 400 yuan ($63) in
subsidies ended Dec. 31, according to James Hu, an analyst at
Capital Securities Corp. The earlier policies were issued in
2009 to bolster domestic consumption as the global financial
crisis eroded demand for Chinese exports.  “It may come as early as the National People’s Congress
next month,” Hu said by telephone from Shanghai, referring to
the annual meeting of the nation’s legislature that’s scheduled
to start March 5 in Beijing.  China’s exports fell for the first time in more than two
years in January as trade was disrupted by the weeklong Chinese
New Year holiday and  Europe ’s debt crisis hurt demand.  Qingdao Haier Co. (600690) , China’s largest home appliance maker,
climbed 3.6 percent in Shanghai to 10.68 yuan. GD Midea Holding
Co. gained 1.7  percent  in Shenzhen trading.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
