Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker ,
who leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, convened the
group to discuss  Greece  at 2 p.m. on March 1 in Brussels,
shortly before a European Union summit.  Ministers will “take stock” of Greece’s ongoing debt swap
with private creditors “and of the implementation of the prior
actions by the Greek authorities,” Juncker said today in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
