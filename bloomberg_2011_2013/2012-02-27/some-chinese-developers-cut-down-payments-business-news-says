Some Chinese developers are allowing
first-time homebuyers to delay their down payments to boost
sales,  China Business News  reported today, citing unidentified
agents.  Developers in cities including Nanjing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou
and Wuhan sold some projects with a 10 percent down payment, the
newspaper reported. The sellers advanced the remaining 20
percent, which buyers don’t have to pay back for as long as
three years in some cases, the newspaper said, citing agents and
sales people it didn’t identify. First-home buyers in  China  need
to pay a minimum 30 percent down payment.  The marketing strategy, used by some developers in 2008,
gained popularity recently as housing inventories grew,
according to AJ Securities Co. China’s January  home prices 
recorded their worst performance in at least a year, with none
of the 70 cities monitored by the government posting gains as
Premier  Wen Jiabao  reiterated his determination to maintain
property curbs.  “Developers have fairly strong needs to boost sales under
this environment,” said Zuo Hongying, a Shanghai-based analyst
at AJ Securities, adding that the practice “won’t become too
widespread” as delaying down payments in effect increases
leverage and risk.  China has since 2010 battled rising home prices with
measures including higher down payments and mortgage rates, as
well as home purchase restrictions in more than 40 cities.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editors: Linus Chua, Andreea Papuc  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
