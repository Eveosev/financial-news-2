Serbia’s government invited offers
for an adviser who would assist in a planned tender for tapping
the country’s biggest oil shale reserves.  The consultancy services are sought for “selecting a
strategic partner for exploitation, processing and production of
oil and oil derivatives” from shale, in the so-called Aleksinac
basin in the south, the  Ministry of Environment, Mining and
Spatial Planning  announced on its website today.  The area is home to an estimated 2 billion tons of shale
reserves. The deadline for offers is March 23, the ministry
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
