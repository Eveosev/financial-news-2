Sweden’s central bank gold reserves
were unchanged at 125.7 metric tons in January, Joanna Gerwin,
acting head of communication, said by phone today.  The  International Monetary Fund  earlier reported an 18.3
metric-ton increase in the bank’s reserves. Officials at the
IMF’s office in Paris said nobody in Europe was able to comment.
Alistair Thomson, a spokesman for the IMF in Washington, didn’t
immediately reply to a voicemail and e-mail from Bloomberg
outside normal business hours.  To contact the reporters on this story:
