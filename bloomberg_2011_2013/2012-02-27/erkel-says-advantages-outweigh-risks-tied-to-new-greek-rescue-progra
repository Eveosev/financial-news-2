Chancellor Angela Merkel  said the
risks to the euro area and the global economy of a Greek rescue
program have to be weighed against the advantages as she called
on lawmakers to vote for the latest Greek rescue package.   “The chances of the new program outweigh the risks,”
Merkel told lawmakers today as they prepared to vote on a 130
billion-euro rescue package for Greece, the second in two years.
“As chancellor of the Federal Republic of  Germany , I have to
take some risks, but I can’t embark on adventures.”   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
