Jebel Ali Free Zone FZE, a business
park operator in Dubai, hired  Citigroup Inc. (C)  to find a buyer for
its U.K warehouse unit Gazeley Ltd. as it seeks to raise cash to
pay a bond, according to a person familiar with the deal.  Citigroup will explore all options for Gazeley, a developer
of logistics warehouses that the Dubai-based company acquired
from  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  in 2008, the person said, declining to
be identified because the information is private. Reuters
reported the news earlier today.  A spokesman for Dubai World, Jebel Ali Free Zone’s parent,
and a spokesman for Citigroup in Dubai declined to comment. They
couldn’t be identified because of company policy.  Gazeley operates in the U.K., Europe, the  Middle East  and
China, develops warehouses and distribution buildings, as well
as has access to a land bank, according to its website.  Jebel Ali Free Zone has a 7.5 billion-dirham ($2 billion)
Islamic bond maturing in November, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
