Kenya’s  All-Share Index (NSEASI)  advanced for
the fifth straight day, gaining 1.5 percent to 57.32 in Nairobi,
the biggest jump since Oct. 28.  The  FTSE/Namibia Overall Index (FTN098)  snapped two days of gains,
dropping 1.2 percent to 911.56 in Windhoek. The  Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share Index (NGSEINDX)  retreated 0.6 percent to 20,364.56 in
Lagos, according to an e-mailed statement from the bourse.
Mauritius’s  SEMDEX Index (SEMDEX)  fell for a fifth day, declining 0.1
percent to 1,798.7.  The following shares were active in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Total Kenya Ltd. (TKNL)  , a local unit of  Total SA (FP) ,
snapped three days of gains, falling 0.3 percent to 18.05
shillings. Oil slipped, halting its longest rally in two years,
after a warning from the  International Monetary Fund  on the
global economy sparked concern prices have climbed too fast.  Oando Plc (OANDO)  , a Nigerian energy company, advanced
for a fourth day, jumping the daily limit of 5 percent to the
highest level since Jan. 11 as investors bet the shares’ decline
earlier this month was overdone.  “Its price has fallen too low, compared with where it is
coming from,” said Emeka Madubuike, managing director of Lagos-
based Compass Investments and Securities Ltd. Investors believe
its price will rise again because “it is a well-diversified oil
marketing company with several income streams,” Madubuike said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
