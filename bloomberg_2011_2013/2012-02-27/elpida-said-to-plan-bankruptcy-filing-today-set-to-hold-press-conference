Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) , the Japanese
chipmaker facing an April deadline to repay debts, will file for
 bankruptcy protection  as soon as today, according to a person
with direct knowledge of the matter.  The company will hold a press conference at 6:30 p.m. in
Tokyo, said the person, who requested anonymity before an
official announcement. The Nikkei reported earlier that the
company will file for bankruptcy protection with 480 billion yen
($5.9 billion) in liabilities.  The maker of dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chips
used in computers said earlier this month it sees
“uncertainty” over remaining in business because it didn’t
have the necessary financing. Elpida hadn’t been able to reach a
deal with the trade ministry, the  Development Bank of Japan  and
its main lenders over financing for 92 billion yen in bonds and
loans due by April, the Tokyo-based company said Feb. 14.  Calls made to the office and mobile phones of the company’s
public relations department weren’t answered.  Elpida rose 0.6 percent to 334 yen in Tokyo trading. The
shares have declined 6.7 percent this year after slumping 62
percent last year.  Elpida’s trouble indicates the difficulty Japanese
companies have in competing with  South Korea ’s Samsung
Electronics Co., which had 7.34 trillion won ($6.5 billion) in
operating profit from selling chips last year. Chip prices had
become as cheap as a “rice ball,” Elpida Chief Executive Officer
Yukio Sakamoto said last year.  Samsung boosted its profits by producing specialty chips
for smartphones, tablet computers and servers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
