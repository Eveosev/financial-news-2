The city of  Sacramento ,  California ,
and its only major professional sports team, basketball’s Kings,
reached agreement to keep the club from relocating, said owner
Gavin Maloof, who called it “the second-greatest moment of my
life.”  The Kings will contribute about $73 million up-front and
another $73 million over the team’s 30-year lease, he said in a
telephone interview from Orlando, Florida, where his family,
Sacramento Mayor  Kevin Johnson  and National Basketball
Association Commissioner David Stern were meeting during All-
Star weekend to work out the deal that would keep the club from
moving.  The new arena, which costs about $400 million, would open
in time for the 2015 season, Maloof said. The city will
contribute about $250 million, Maloof said without being
specific.  “Unbelievable for a public entity in this day and age,”
said Maloof, citing the day that he bought the Kings as the
greatest moment of his life. “We’re not going anywhere.”  Johnson is a former NBA All-Star.  To contact the reporter on this story:
