Icelandâ€™s President Olafur R. Grimsson said he may seek a fifth four-year term as head of
state in elections due to take place in June.  Grimsson said he was responding to a petition signed by
30,000 Icelanders urging him to run. He spoke in a televised
address from his residence outside Reykjavik.  Grimsson twice blocked a parliamentary accord on repaying
British and Dutch depositor claims stemming from the failure of
Landsbanki Islands hf in 2008. Icelandic voters subsequently
rejected the agreement in a referendum last year and Iceland has
yet to settle the dispute through an international court case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
