The zloty weakened as investors
speculated the central bank will probably cut  interest rates  for
the last time in its loosening cycle to a record low.  The zloty depreciated 0.3 percent to 4.3373 against the
euro by 3:38 p.m. in Warsaw, bringing this year’s loss to 5.9
percent, the worst performance among  Europe ’s emerging-market
currencies after Turkey’s lira and  Russia ’s ruble. Yields on
Poland’s 10-year bonds fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 4.31 percent, after a 76 basis-point surge
last month, the most since October 2003.  The Monetary Policy Council will cut rates by 25 basis
points to 2.5 percent on July 3, according to 38 out of 39
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The panel has reduced rates by
a total of 200 basis points since November.  Poland ’s purchasing
managers’ index rose to 49.3 in June from 48 in May, staying
below 50, a level which indicates contraction, for the 15th
month in a row, HSBC Holdings said today.  While providing “hope for a gradual recovery in the second
half of the year,” the manufacturing data are “not positive
enough to dissuade the council from the last 25-basis-point cut
in the cycle,” Adam Piekos, an economist at Bank Pekao SA,
wrote in a note today.  The zloty could suffer more as investors pull out of local
bonds, Pasquale Diana, an economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in
a note from Warsaw.  “We remain concerned about the potential impact on the
zloty of even small outflows from the  bond market ,” she wrote
in a report today.  Foreign investors trimmed Polish government bond holdings
by about 2 percent in June, from 207.5 billion zloty ($62.3
billion) at the end of May, Piotr Marczak, head of the  Finance
Ministry ’s public debt department, said on June 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
