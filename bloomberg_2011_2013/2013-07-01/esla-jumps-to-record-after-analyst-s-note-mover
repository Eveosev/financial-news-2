Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)  surged to a record
high after a Jefferies Group LLC analyst almost doubled her
price target for the maker of electric cars and increased
estimates of its 2013 deliveries.  Tesla gained 9.1 percent to $117.18 in  New York , its
highest closing price. Shares of the  Palo Alto , California-based
company more that tripled this year, compared with a 13 percent
rise for the Russell 1000 Index.  Elaine Kwei, an analyst for Jefferies, today raised her
price target on Tesla to $130 from $70 and increased her
estimate of 2013 Tesla production to 21,500 Model S sedans from
19,800. Kwei also boosted her estimate for Tesla’s second-quarter output to 5,000 from 4,500.  “Despite the massive run in the stock, we believe TSLA is
one of the best growth stories in the market today and still has
upside,” Kwei wrote, referring to Tesla’s ticker symbol. The
analyst cited higher Model S sales and better profit margins as
among “potential positive catalysts.”  Tesla’s shares have risen this year after the company
reported its first profit and it repaid a $465 million U.S.
Energy Department loan nine years ahead of schedule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
