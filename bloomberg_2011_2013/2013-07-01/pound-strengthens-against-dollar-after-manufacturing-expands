The pound rose for the first time in
five days against the dollar after an industry report based on a
survey of purchasing managers showed U.K. manufacturing expanded
last month, adding to signs the economy is recovering.  Sterling climbed from near a one-month low versus the U.S.
currency as separate data showed mortgage approvals increased
and U.K. stocks rallied. Gilts rose following their worst
quarter since June 2008 when  government securities  tumbled after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank
may reduce debt purchases this year.  Mark Carney  took the helm
at the Bank of England today before a policy meeting this week.  “Investors are looking to buy sterling given the U.K. PMI
and mortgage approvals,” said  Neil Jones , head of European
hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. U.K.
stocks are rising “and the pound is again benefiting in turn.”  The pound advanced 0.2 percent to $1.5247 at 4:45 p.m.
London time after falling to $1.5166 on June 28, the weakest
level since May 31. The U.K. currency was little changed at
85.67 pence per euro.  A gauge of U.K. manufacturing rose to 52.5 in June from
51.5 the previous month,  Markit Economics  and the Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply said in London. A reading
above 50 shows expansion. Lenders  granted  58,242 home loans in
May, the most since December 2009, according to a separate
report from the Bank of England.  The FTSE 100 Index of U.K. shares gained 1.5 percent.  Sterling has strengthened 3.2 percent in the past three
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that
track 10 developed-market currencies. The euro gained 5 percent
and the dollar advanced 3.1 percent.  Gilts Gain  The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.42 percent. The 1.75
percent security due in September 2022 gained 0.175, or 1.75
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 94.505.  Carney will lead his first meeting as  Bank of England 
governor on July 3-4 and will assess whether further aid to the
economy is needed to support the recovery. Policy makers will
maintain the central bank’s bond-purchase  target  at 375 billion
pounds and the benchmark  interest rate  at 0.5 percent, according
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Overseas investors became net buyers of gilts in May after
cutting their holdings in April for the first time in 10 months,
according to a report today from the Bank of England. Foreign
investors bought 6.9 billion pounds of gilts more than they sold
in May, the data showed.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 3.5 percent this year
through June 28, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 1.7 percent and Treasuries declined 2.8
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
