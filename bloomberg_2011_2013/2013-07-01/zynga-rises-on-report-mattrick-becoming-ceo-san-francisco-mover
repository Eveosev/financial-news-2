Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , the biggest maker of
online social games, surged as much as 13 percent after
AllThingsD reported that the company may replace Chief Executive
Officer Mark Pincus.  Zynga may name Don Mattrick, entertainment head at
Microsoft Corp., as CEO as early as today, AllThingsD said,
citing people familiar with the matter. Shares of Zynga rose 9.4
percent to $3.04 at 1:39 p.m. in New York, and earlier touched
$3.14 for the biggest gain since April 3.  Pincus, who founded Zynga in 2007, is struggling to restart
growth as more users shift their attention away from games on
desktop websites such as Facebook Inc.’s social network, Zynga’s
core business, and toward titles played on smartphones and
tablets. The CEO in April lowered his salary to $1 and opted not
to receive a cash bonus or equity award this year as the company
works to cut costs.  In October, Pincus said he was making “tough decisions”
such as eliminating 5 percent of jobs, shutting offices and
ending development on more than a dozen game titles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
