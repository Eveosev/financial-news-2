Credit Suisse Group AG, Switzerland’s
second-biggest bank, hired Joachim Oechslin from  Munich Re  as
its chief risk officer, succeeding Tobias Guldimann.  Oechslin will start on Jan. 1 and will be a member of the
executive board, the Zurich-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today. Guldimann will become head of reputational
risk, corporate responsibility and regulatory policy.  Munich Re (MUV2) , the world’s biggest reinsurer, appointed
Oechslin chief risk officer in 2007. Prior to that, he was
deputy head of risk at Paris-based  AXA SA. (CS)   Guldimann, 51, who joined Credit Suisse in 1986, has been
the bank’s chief risk officer since 2004. He will step down from
the executive board when he assumes his new role.  “Under his leadership Credit Suisse has a track record of
very low credit losses over many years,” Chairman Urs Rohner
and Chief Executive Officer  Brady Dougan  said in the statement.
“He has helped steer the bank through very challenging markets
and has been instrumental in ensuring that Credit Suisse
continues to implement sound and constructive policies in the
evolving global regulatory environment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
