New York  Yankees third baseman  Alex Rodriguez  has been medically cleared to begin playing baseball
for the first time in nine months after having hip surgery
during the offseason.  Rodriguez, 37, will begin a rehabilitation assignment with
the  Major League Baseball  team’s Single-A Charleston RiverDogs
affiliate, the Yankees said today in a statement. He will start
tomorrow at third base and play a minimum of three innings.  A three-time American League Most Valuable Player,
Rodriguez hit .272 last year with 18 home runs and 57 runs
batted-in. He struggled in the postseason, batting .120 with 12
strikeouts in 25 at-bats and had surgery in January to repair a
torn labrum in his left hip.  Major League Baseball is investigating Rodriguez’s link to
a now-closed anti-aging clinic in Florida that the Miami New
Times said provided players with performance enhancing drugs.  When Rodriguez announced last week on his Twitter account
that he was cleared to play games again, Yankees General Manager
 Brian Cashman  told ESPN that the 14-time All-Star “should just
shut up,” also using an expletive.  To contact the reporters on this story:
