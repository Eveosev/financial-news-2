The average U.S.  retail gasoline 
price fell to the lowest level since January as refineries
increased output in the Midwest, easing supply fears.  Gasoline prices averaged $3.496 a gallon today, down 8.1
cents from the previous week and the lowest level since Jan. 28,
according to data from the  U.S. Energy Information

this time last year.  Prices fell in every geographic region, led by the Midwest,
where the average price dropped 15.2 cents to $3.394. Prices
there have dropped 12 percent since June 10.  BP Plc (BP/) â€™s refinery in Whiting,  Indiana , restarted its

capacity of 413,000 barrels a day, the company said today in a
written statement.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  finished a planned
turnaround at its Joliet, Illinois, refinery on June 9.  Gasoline  supplies  in the Midwest have grown every week
since May 17, when they dropped to a one-year low of 47.6
million barrels. Stocks grew by 206,000 barrels to 49.9 million
in the week ended June 21, according to Energy Information
