Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  fell as two gauges of China’s manufacturing fell in
June, underscoring a slowdown in the nation’s economy.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange declined as much as 1 percent to 3,501 yuan ($571) a
metric ton before trading at 3,518 at 10:28 a.m. local time.
Futures fell 6.8 percent last quarter, the most since the three
months ended in September.  The  National Bureau of Statistics  reported that the
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index was at 50.1, the slowest expansion in
four months. A separate Purchasing Managers’ Index released by
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics was 48.2, the weakest
since September.  “The economic data continued to convince the market about
the bearish outlook for building material demand,” Xie Zhaowei,
an analyst at Huatai Great Wall Futures Co., said by phone from
Shanghai today.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in China
gained 1 percent to $116.50 a dry ton on June 28, according to
The Steel Index Ltd. The raw material is a key ingredient for
steel production.  The average  spot price  for rebar in China was little
changed at 3,358  yuan  a ton on June 28, according to data from
