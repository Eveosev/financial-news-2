Prime Minister  David Cameron  said he
wanted to see the overall “cost of politics” in the U.K. fall
even if an independent body calls for substantial increases in
lawmaker pay.  The  Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority , set up
in the wake of the 2009 lawmaker expenses scandal, is preparing
recommendations on what members of Parliament should be paid.
They currently earn 66,396 pounds ($101,000) a year.  Cameron has no power to block any recommended rise, however
politically unpopular it might be at a time when the government
has frozen pay for other public officials. He told reporters
traveling with him in  Pakistan  that he wanted to see the overall
bill for Parliament fall.  “Whatever IPSA recommends, we can’t see the cost of
politics or Westminster going up,” Cameron said. “Anything
like that would be unthinkable unless the cost of politics was
frozen and cut.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
