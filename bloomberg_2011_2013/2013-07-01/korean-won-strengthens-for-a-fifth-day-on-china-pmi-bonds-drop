South Korea’s won rose for a fifth
day, the longest run of gains in two months, after manufacturing
in  China  expanded in line with projections, boosting optimism
about the region’s economic outlook. Bonds fell.  China’s Purchasing Managers’  Index (CPMINDX)  was at 50.1, matching
the median forecast of 33 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey,
according to official data released today in Beijing. Readings
above 50 signal expansion. The world’s no. 2 economy is the
biggest buyer of South Korean goods.  The won advanced 0.5 percent to 1,136.73 per dollar as of
11:30 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
exchange rate used to price options, fell 40 basis points, or
0.40 percentage point to 10.99 percent.  “The market reacted positively to China’s official PMI
data,” said Jude Noh, a currency trader at Suhyup Bank in
Seoul. “The number above 50 gave assurance to the market.”  South Korea’s exports fell 0.9 percent in June from a year
ago, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said today. That
compares with the median estimate of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey for a 0.1 percent gain. The country’s June manufacturing
PMI declined to 49.4 from 51.1 in May, according to HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.  The yield on the 2.75 percent government notes due June
2016 rose seven basis points to 2.95 percent, snapping a four-day decline, prices from Korea Exchange Inc. show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
