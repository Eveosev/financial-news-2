J. Sainsbury Plc (SBRY) , the U.K.’s third-largest supermarket chain, plans to start its own mobile-phone
service in a joint venture with  Vodafone Group Plc. (VOD)   The new service, called Mobile by Sainsbury’s, will start
“later this summer” and will allow clients to collect points
on the Nectar customer-loyalty program, Sainsbury said in a
statement today.  Sainsbury’s larger competitors,  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  and  Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s Asda, have their own mobile-phone services, with
Tesco starting its offering 10 years ago. Supermarket chains are
starting more digital and mobile-phone services to hold on to
business as shoppers increasingly make purchases online.  To contact the reporter on this story:
