European stocks rose, after their
first weekly gain since May 17, as euro-area factory output in
June contracted less than estimated and Japanese manufacturers
turned optimistic for the first time since September 2011.  Nokia Oyj rallied 3.7 percent after the Finnish phonemaker
agreed to buy Siemens AG’s stake in their joint venture.
Siemens,  Europe ’s largest maker of power equipment, increased
2.6 percent. PSA Peugeot Citroen fell 2.5 percent after French
car registrations declined in June.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 1.2 percent to 288.29 at
the close of trading. The benchmark advanced 1.7 percent last
week as  China  took steps to ease a cash crunch. It still lost
5.3 percent in June after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said the central bank could taper stimulus measures if
the  U.S. economy  improves sustainably.  “We’ve had quite a weak month in June, so people may be
prepared to look more positively,” said  Andrea Williams , who
helps oversee $76 billion as head of European equities at Royal
London Asset Management. “Investors may be a bit more
aggressive on the cyclicals.  Japan ’s manufacturing report helps,
with the economic conditions improving because of the actions
that have been taken.”  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area
increased to 48.8 last month from 48.3 in May, London-based
Markit Economics said today. That’s above an initial estimate of
48.7 on June 20. The gauge has been  below 50 , indicating
contraction, since July 2011.  Japanese Optimism  In Japan, a central bank report showed the quarterly  Tankan
index (JNTSMFG)  for large manufacturers rose to plus 4 in June from minus
8 in March. The first positive figure since September 2011
signaled that optimists outnumber pessimists. The median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for 3.  In the U.S., a report showed that factory output in the
world’s largest economy increased in June. The  Institute for
Supply Management ’s  manufacturing index  rose to 50.9 from 49 the
prior month. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had forecast an
increase to 50.5.  National benchmark indexes advanced in all of the western
European markets except Iceland.  France ’s CAC 40 added 0.8
percent, while  Germany ’s DAX increased 0.3 percent. The U.K.’s
FTSE 100 rallied 1.5 percent, the most since May 28.  In China, an official purchasing managers’ index of factory
output dropped to 50.1, the lowest level in four months, from
50.8, the National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing said. A private PMI from HSBC Holdings
and Markit was 48.2, the weakest since September. Readings above
50 signal expansion.  Nokia, Siemens  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  jumped 3.7 percent to 2.95 euros after saying it
will buy Siemens’ 50 percent holding in Nokia Siemens Networks
for 1.7 billion euros ($2.2 billion). Siemens gained 2.6 percent
to 79.63 euros, its biggest gain since August 2012, after the
companies agreed to end their six-year long telecommunications-equipment joint venture.  Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB)  added 4 percent to 229.30 kronor after
Bank of America Corp. raised its recommendation on the shares to
buy from neutral, citing an improved outlook for the retailer’s
online business.  A gauge of  travel and leisure companies  performed the best
of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600. Compass Group Plc
climbed 2.7 percent to 863 pence, contributing the  most  to
gains. Ryanair Holdings Plc, Europe’s biggest discount airline,
increased 3.9 percent to 7.38 euros in Dublin, its highest price
since at least May 1997.  Hunting Jumps  Hunting Plc (HTG)  rallied 9 percent to 798 pence, its biggest
gain since August 2011, after the U.K. oil-services provider
said first-half results will meet analysts’ estimates and that
its outlook remains positive for the rest of the year.  Peugeot fell 2.5 percent to 6.17 euros after data showed
the carmaker’s registrations in France fell 9.5 percent to
57,962 in June.  RWE AG slid 5.2 percent to 23.25 euros, the lowest price
since September 2011, as it said winning cash back from OAO
Gazprom after a court ruling last week will not affect its 2013
earnings targets. Der Spiegel magazine had reported earlier
today that Gazprom may pay Germany’s second-largest utility 1
billion euros on gas contracts covering a three-year period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
