The Markit Economics  final index  of
U.S. manufacturing decreased in June to 51.9 from 52.3 a month
earlier, the London-based group said today.  The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 12 economists
was 52.3 after a preliminary June reading of 52.2. Estimates
ranged from 51.8 to 52.8. A reading greater than 50 for the
purchasing managers’ measure indicates expansion.  The Markit purchasers figure is based on responses from 85
percent to 90 percent of companies in a poll of more than 600
American manufacturers.  Today’s PMI data followed mixed reports on global
manufacturing. In  China , a pair of factory gauges fell in June,
underscoring a sustained slowdown in the nation’s economy as
policy makers seek to rein in financial speculation and real-estate prices.  Manufacturing output in the 17-nation euro area contracted
less than initially estimated in June, adding to signs the
currency bloc’s economy is starting to emerge from a record-long
recession, according to figures from Markit.  Markit’s U.K. factory index rose to the highest level in
two years, indicating the recovery is gaining traction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
