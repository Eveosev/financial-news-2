The  New York  Knicks reached an
agreement to acquire former No. 1 draft pick Andrea Bargnani
from the Toronto Raptors for  Steve Novak , Marcus Camby and a
first-round selection in 2016, the  New York Times reported ,
citing an unidentified person involved in the talks.  The 7-foot Bargnani, 27, has averaged 15.2 points and 4.8
rebounds a game since being taken by the Raptors with the first
overall pick in the 2006 National Basketball Association draft.
He’s owed $22.25 million over the next two seasons and unloading
his contract was a priority for new Raptors General Manager
Masai Ujiri, the Times said.  The trade can’t be officially completed until July 10, when
the NBA’s moratorium on trades and signings is lifted.  Bargnani averaged 12.7 points in 35 games, including 25
starts for the Raptors last season. He’d join  Carmelo Anthony ,
 Tyson Chandler  and Amar’e Stoudemire in a Knicks’ frontcourt
that lost Rasheed Wallace and Kurt Thomas to season-ending
injuries in 2012-13. Camby is 39 and owed $8.6 million over the
next two seasons, while the 30-year-old Novak, a three-point
shooting specialist, has three years and $10.9 million left on
his deal with the Knicks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
