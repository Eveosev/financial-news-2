The  difference  between the world’s
two most-traded crude oil grades shrank to less than $5 a barrel
for the first time in about 2 1/2 years, underlining the easing
of a supply bottleneck in the U.S.  North Sea Brent crude’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
narrowed to as little as $4.77 a barrel today. It’s the first
time the spread between the two grades has been at $5 or less
since Jan. 18, 2011, on an intraday basis, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. WTI, the main U.S. crude grade, had been
typically the more expensive grade until mid-2010.  The drop in the gap between Brent, a gauge for more than
half the world’s oil, and WTI shows how improved pipeline
networks and the use of rail links have helped to unlock a glut
at America’s oil-storage hub at Cushing,  Oklahoma , in line with
a prediction made by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as long ago as
February 2012. WTI rose 5.2 percent in the first half of this
year. Brent dropped by 8.1 percent as North Sea supplies have
stabilized following oilfield maintenance.  “The spread is coming in on anticipation that we’re going
to see pipelines get built and more rail capacity put in
place,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, which oversees
$1.4 billion. “There is now a likelihood that not only will
U.S. imports drop further, but that the country will be
exporting before long.”  Crude Prices  WTI for August delivery advanced $1.43, or 1.5 percent, to
$97.99 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement since June 19.  Brent for August settlement increased 84 cents, or 0.8
percent, to end at $103 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Brent’s premium over WTI closed at $5.01 after
falling below the $5 level in intraday trading. That’s the
lowest settlement since Jan. 4, 2011.  WTI futures  open interest  reached a record high of 1.87
million contracts on June 18. The number of total contracts
outstanding has stayed above 1.8 million since June 10. Brent
open interest reached a record high of 1.61 million on May 13.  Since the start of 2012, new and reversed pipelines have
boosted capacity to Houston by almost 1.2 million barrels a day,
with another 850,000 barrels a day coming online by the end of
the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The coming
expansions include the  Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP) ’s Longhorn
pipeline,  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s southern leg of Keystone XL and
 Sunoco Logistics Partners LP (SXL) ’s Permian Express line.  Light Crude  “WTI is enjoying its return to market leadership,”
 Olivier Jakob , managing director at Petromatrix GmbH, an energy-research company in Zug, Switzerland, said in a June 25 report
as the spread narrowed to less than $6.  The WTI-Brent spread widened to a record of $28.08 a barrel
on Oct. 14, 2011. It was $19.29 at the end of last year and
averaged $16.04 since the start of 2011 through June 28 this
year.  “Even U.S. East Coast refineries, which historically have
relied on Brent crude oil and Brent-like crudes, can now access
U.S. light sweet crude oil,” the U.S. Energy Information
Administration, a unit of the Energy Department, said in a
report on June 28. “U.S. crude that moves by rail is replacing
Brent crude oil and Brent-like crude oil imports into the U.S.
East Coast, putting downward pressure on the price of Brent
crude oil and narrowing the differential versus WTI crude oil.”  Goldman Sachs  Goldman Sachs was for many months all but alone in
predicting that the spread, one of the most-traded price
relationships in energy markets, would decrease.  The bank reiterated its stance in subsequent reports, even
as the differential widened to as much as $26 on Nov. 15.
Goldman said on May 10, that it expected the premium to drop to
$5 a barrel in the third quarter.  North Sea crude production in July is set to rise to 1.94
million barrels a day, the most since April and 3.1 percent
higher than a year earlier, as the main maintenance period for
the region’s oil fields ended, according to loading program data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
