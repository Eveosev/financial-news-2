Russia’s Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts
director Irina Antonova left her job after holding the post for
more than half a century, Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky
said today.  Antonova, 91, is a “legend” with a unique record of
service, Medinsky said, according to a statement on the
ministry’s website. The new head of the Pushkin Museum, art-director for the Manezh exhibition alliance Marina Loshak, is
expected to add “fresh breath” to the museum, he said.  In 1974, Antonova brought the  Mona Lisa  to Moscow for the
first time and Muscovites queued for several hours to see the
painting.  “She is the person that Moscow should be grateful to for
getting all the outstanding pieces of art,” Vladimir Tolstoy,
adviser on culture for President  Vladimir Putin , said by
telephone.  This year, Antonova’s proposal to move a part of St.
Petersburg’s Hermitage museum collection to Moscow was
criticized by Medinsky. Antonova, who is to get a new job as
museum’s president, said she quit to spend more time with her
family.  Pushkin Museum, which celebrated its centenary in 2012, is
Moscow’s largest museum of Western art, with 670,000 exhibits,
according to its website.  Muse highlights include  Manuela Hoelterhoff  on arts,  Elin
McCoy  on wine,  Mark Beech  on music,  Catherine Hickley  on German
art and  Greg Evans  on U.S. television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
