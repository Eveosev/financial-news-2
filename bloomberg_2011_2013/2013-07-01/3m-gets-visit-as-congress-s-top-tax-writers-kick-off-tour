Congress’s top two tax-writers will
start a “tax reform tour” at  3M Co. (MMM) , taking their bipartisan
pitch from Washington to  Minnesota ’s Twin Cities.  Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, and Representative Dave Camp, who leads the House
Ways and Means Committee, plan to tour the St. Paul, Minnesota-based manufacturer of Ace bandages and Scotch tape on July 8 as
they try to promote a revision of the U.S. tax system.  “We’re going to be traveling across the country in the
coming weeks, meeting with Americans –- individuals, families,
workers and business owners, big and small,” Baucus and Camp
said in a joint statement today. “We want to hear how we can
make the system fairer and easier to deal with for families
across America.”  After 3M, the lawmakers will head to Baldinger’s Bakery in
St. Paul, a 125-year-old maker of hamburger buns and English
muffins.  Baucus, a Montana Democrat, and Camp, a Michigan
Republican, have been working together toward a tax rewrite even
as they disagree on whether a revised tax code should raise more
revenue for the government. They created a joint handle on the
Twitter social network and a website -- www.taxreform.gov -- to
try to build public support.  Baucus and Camp haven’t yet announced other appearances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
