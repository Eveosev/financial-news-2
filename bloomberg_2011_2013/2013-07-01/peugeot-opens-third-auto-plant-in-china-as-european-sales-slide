PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) , the unprofitable
French automaker, opened a third assembly plant in China,
expanding in the world’s largest vehicle market even as a slump
in European demand prompts it to cut jobs at home.  Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin, who flew in for the
opening ceremony in Wuhan, central China, said the plant will
help the company capture 5 percent of the nation’s market by
2015. The Citroen C-Elysee and Peugeot 301 sedan will be among
four models produced at the factory, opened with Dongfeng Motor
Corp., which will increase the company’s annual capacity by two-thirds to 750,000 units by the end of 2015, it said.  Peugeot’s expansion in  China  contrasts with its job cuts in
France. The Paris-based automaker, which produced 40 percent of
its vehicles at home last year, reported a 576 million-euro
($753 million) operating loss last year and has started
implementing a restructuring plan that includes closing a
factory on the outskirts of the capital and eliminating 11,200
positions in the country.  “China is probably the only way for PSA to get out of
their difficulties in  Europe ,” said Klaus Paur, global head of
automotive at industry researcher Ipsos in  Shanghai . Peugeot’s
reliance on Europe has “amplified” their problems, he said.  European Slump  European car sales fell to a 20-year low in May as record
joblessness caused by a recession in the euro area reduced
demand at Peugeot, Renault SA,  Fiat SpA (F)  and  General Motors Co. (GM) 
Political leaders are seeking ways to revive a shrinking economy
weighed down by the sovereign-debt crisis, with unemployment in
the 17 countries using the euro reaching a record 12.2 percent
in April.  Dongfeng Peugeot Citroen’s sales in China surged 33 percent
to 276,896 units in the first half of the year and the company
is planning to introduce 11 models in the country until 2015,
Dongfeng Peugeot Citroen General Manager Qiu Xiandong said
today. That would put it on course to outpace China’s passenger-vehicle market, which has risen 15 percent in the first five
months.  The automaker raised its sales target in China to 557,000
units this year from 500,000 units on improved demand, according
to Gregoire Olivier, chief executive of Asian operations, in an
April interview. China may overtake  France  as its biggest market
by 2015, he said in February.  New Models  Jean Mouro, deputy general manager at Dongfeng Peugeot
Citroen, said the company plans to introduce at least one model
for each of its brands annually until 2015. The company plans to
increase its dealerships in China to 1,200 by 2015 from 878 at
the end of this year, Mouro said.  Peugeot sells three SUVs -- the locally produced Peugeot
3008, the imported Citroen C4 Aircross and Peugeot 4008 -- along
with sedans and hatchbacks in China. The C2 and Peugeot 207,
their lowest-priced models, start from 71,800  yuan  ($11,700),
according to the company’s website.  The French automaker will produce cars for its premium DS
line in Shenzhen with Changan Automobile Group.  By making cars in China, Peugeot avoids tariffs that add at
least 25 percent to costs of imported cars. Last month, GM
started work on a new Cadillac factory in Shanghai while  Ford
Motor Co. (F)  opened an assembly plant in southern China that more
than doubled its production capacity.  French auto brands increased their market share of
passenger vehicles in China to 3.2 percent in the January-to-May
period from 2.8 percent a year earlier, according to the auto
association. They trailed American, Japanese,  Germany  and Korean
marques among foreign automakers.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
