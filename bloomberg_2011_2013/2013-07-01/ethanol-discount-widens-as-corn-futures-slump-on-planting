Ethanol weakened  against gasoline as
corn futures touched the lowest level since October 2010 after
the U.S. raised planting estimates.  The discount, or price difference, between the two fuels,
widened 0.46 cent to 30.36 cents a gallon at 11:44 a.m. in New
York, the biggest differential in more than a week, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread grew after the
Agriculture Department said U.S. farmers seeded 97.4 million
acres of corn, the most since 1936.  Corn is the primary ingredient in U.S.-made ethanol. The
planting report suggests more of the crop will be available for
blending and may boost ethanol production and supply.  “Today’s weakness is related to the corn futures being
lower after a shockingly bearish report for new crop,” said
 Jason Ward , a market analyst at Northstar Commodity Investments
LLC in  Minneapolis .  Denatured ethanol for July delivery retreated 0.9 cent to
$2.444 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices are up 12
percent this year.  Gasoline for August delivery gained 3.14 cents to $2.747 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Corn for delivery in December fell as much as 1.4 percent
to $5.0375 a bushel, the lowest for a most-active contract since
Oct. 8, 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One
bushel of corn makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it was minus 4
cents, compared with minus 35 cents on Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
