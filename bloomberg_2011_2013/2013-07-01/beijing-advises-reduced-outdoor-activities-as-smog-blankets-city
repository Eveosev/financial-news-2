Beijing advised the young, elderly
and ill among its 20 million people to avoid outdoor activities
as a U.S. Embassy  pollution monitor  showed  air quality  at
“unhealthy” levels in the Chinese capital.  Concentrations of PM2.5, fine air particulates that pose
the greatest health risk, rose to 281 micrograms per cubic meter
at 4 p.m. near  Tiananmen Square , compared with an average of 200
over the past 24 hours, according to the Beijing Municipal
Environmental Monitoring Center. That reading was more than 11
times higher than the World Health Organization recommendation
of no higher than 25 for day-long exposure.  The U.S. Embassy’s measure showed PM2.5 levels at 191 as of
4 p.m. local time.  Chinese authorities have introduced curbs on the burning of
coal and vehicle traffic in a bid to assuage public anger
sparked by dirty air and water. The air across most parts of the
city today was “heavily polluted,” the second-worst rating on
the government’s six-level scale. At that level, the city
recommends children, the elderly and people with heart and lung
ailments avoid activities outdoors.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
