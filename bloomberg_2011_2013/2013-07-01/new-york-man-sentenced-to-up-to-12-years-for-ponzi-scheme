A New York man was sentenced to as
long as 12 years in prison for stealing almost $2 million from
18 victims in a  Ponzi scheme  and spending the money on personal
expenses including payments on a vacation home and to a country
club.  Steven Bingaman, 56, of Bedford, New York, pleaded guilty
in July 2012 to charges including grand larceny,  money
laundering  and  securities fraud , Manhattan District Attorney
Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said in a statement. State Supreme Court
Justice Charles Solomon in Manhattan today sentenced Bingaman to
four to 12 years.  “Another Ponzi schemer has been convicted of stealing a
significant amount of money from many victims, in this case a
parcel service worker, two retirees and a struggling small
business,” Vance said. “The victims trusted that the
defendant’s businesses and business dealings were legitimate.
Instead, he squandered their money on a lavish lifestyle.”  Bingaman told the victims he was investing their money or
using it to obtain financing, while instead paying personal
expenses such as country-club dues and mortgages on homes in
Bedford and  Martha’s Vineyard , Massachusetts, and paying other
victims, Vance’s office said.  The case is People v. Bingaman, 02275-2011, New York State
Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
