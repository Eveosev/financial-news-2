Palm oil  gained for the first time in
four days as exports from  Malaysia , the world’s second-largest
producer, climbed ahead of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.  The contract for September delivery advanced as much as 1.2
percent to 2,372 ringgit ($750) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, and ended the morning session at 2,367
ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur . Prices lost 2.2 percent last month to
end at the lowest level for most-active futures since May 21.
Palm for local physical delivery in July was at 2,355 ringgit on
June 28, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Shipments from Malaysia gained 7 percent to 1.35 million
tons in June from a month earlier, surveyor Intertek said today.
Consumption typically increases during Ramadan, which is
scheduled to begin around July 9 this year, when observers break
day-long fasts with communal meals.  “The increase in exports will be a definitive factor until
Ramadan,” said Prathamesh Mallya, an analyst at AnandRathi
Commodities Ltd. in Mumbai. “After Ramadan, you’ll see no more
festivals until October. I would see slight demand still being
there -- demand will remain constant, but incremental demand
will not be there.”  Soybean oil  for December delivery gained 1 percent to 45.57
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, rebounding from the
lowest close for the most-active futures since October 2010 on
June 28, while soybeans for delivery in November were little
changed at $12.515 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery gained 1.4 percent to
5,924  yuan  ($966) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , while
soybean oil advanced 1.3 percent to 7,390 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
