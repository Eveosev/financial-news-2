(Corrects location of company in final paragraph of story
published July 1.)  The U.S. moved back among the top
five most-innovative countries in the world, according to a
study by the  United Nations ’  World Intellectual Property
Organization .  The country followed Switzerland, Sweden, the U.K. and
 Netherlands , according to a  statement  on the report. The last
time the U.S. was among the top five on the Global Innovation
Index was in 2009. Last year it ranked 10th.  The annual report, ranking 142 economies by their
“innovation capability and measurable results,” began in 2007.
Its publication today is timed with the opening of a four-day
conference in Geneva hosted by the UN Economic and Social
Council, focused this year on how science and technology can
help achieve the “Millennium Development Goals.”  In 2000, the UN established the Millennium Development
Goals, a 15-year plan to reduce poverty and child mortality, and
boost access to health care in developing nations.  The U.K. advanced from fifth place, Finland sank to sixth
from fourth, and Singapore also fell from the top five, coming
in at eighth this year.  The index was prepared with help from Shenzhen, China-based
Huawei Technologies Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
