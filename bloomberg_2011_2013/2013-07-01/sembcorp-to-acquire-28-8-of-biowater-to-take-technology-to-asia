Sembcorp Industries Ltd. (SCI)  will acquire
28.8 percent of Biowater Technology AS with a 30 million kroner
($4.9 million) investment in the Norwegian company, gaining
treatment technology that will help the Singaporean energy and
water operator bid for contracts.  Current owners Incitia Ventures, a Norwegian fund manager,
and Mallin Venture AS will invest an extra 8 million kroner,
Sembcorp said in a statement on its website. Other shareholders
include Tonsberg-based Biowater’s staff and its founders.  The transaction will spur Sembcorp’s industrial wastewater
treatment operations in Asia, where nations are seeking to use
technology to curb water use as limits on supply have curbed
power generation. “This part of the world is short on clean
water and is a business opportunity for our technologies,”
Biowater Chief Executive Offer Audun Loedemel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
