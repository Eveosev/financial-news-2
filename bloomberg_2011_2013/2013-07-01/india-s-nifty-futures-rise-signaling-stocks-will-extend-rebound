Indian (SENSEX)  equities climbed, with the
benchmark index completing its biggest three-day gain since
September 2011, amid purchases by foreign funds. Industrials and
utilities led the advance.  The S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.9 percent to 19,577.39 at the
close in Mumbai, after surging 2.8 percent, the most in 18
months, on June 28.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the
world’s largest refining complex, reached a five-month high.
Engineering firms  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT)  and  Bharat Heavy
Electricals Ltd. (BHEL)  added at least 2.6 percent.  Tata Power Co. (TPWR)  and
 NTPC Ltd. (NTPC) , the nation’s biggest generators, gained at least 2.5
percent.  Indian stocks, bonds and the rupee rallied on June 28 as
the government agreed to raise natural-gas prices as part of a
policy overhaul to revive an economy that grew at a decade-low
rate of 5 percent in the year ended March 31. Overseas funds
bought a net 11.2 billion rupees of shares that day, ending 13
straight days of outflows, provisional data from BSE Ltd. show.  “ India  is still a great long term story and when your
currency has appreciated 25 percent against the rupee it gives a
great entry point” for foreign funds, Andrew Holland, chief
executive officer at Ambit Investment Advisors Pvt. in Mumbai,
told Bloomberg TV India.  The rupee has climbed 2 percent from an all-time low of
60.765 per dollar reached on June 26 after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said June 19 the stimulus policies may
end next year. The greenback has risen 6.5 percent against the
rupee in the past year and 20 percent in the 12 months before
that, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Larsen, Tata   Reliance, which has the second-highest weighting on the
Sensex, advanced 2.7 percent to 885.7 rupees, the highest level
since Feb. 4. Larsen jumped 3.1 percent to 1,451.65 rupees, a
two-week high, and Bharat Heavy Electricals surged 2.9 percent
to 179.25 rupees. Tata Power rose 2.7 percent to 88.65 rupees
after the Press Trust of India reported the company raised its
tariff 25 percent. NTPC rallied 3.1 percent to 148.15 rupees.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA)  gained 2.5 percent to 280.7 rupees. The
company plans to raise $1.2 billion selling stakes in some
affiliated companies and will use the money to repay some of the
debt raised for its 2007 purchase of Corus Group, The Sunday
Times reported, citing a person it didn’t identify.  The 30-stock Sensex is valued at 13.1 times  projected 12-month profits , compared with the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s
9.8 times. The Indian gauge’s valuation narrowed to 12.46 times
on June 24, the cheapest since April.  Today’s gains came after overseas investors pulled $139
million from shares on June 27, a 13th day of net sales and the
longest run of outflows in at least five years, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The regulator will release figures for June 28
and July 1 tomorrow as banks were closed to the public today.  Foreigners withdrew a net $1.76 billion from Indian stocks
last month through June 27, the  highest  since the $2.1 billion
pulled in August 2011, the data show.  The CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of India
rallied 1 percent to 5,898.85. Its July futures settled at
5,892.2. India VIX, which measures the cost of protection
against losses in the Nifty, rose 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
