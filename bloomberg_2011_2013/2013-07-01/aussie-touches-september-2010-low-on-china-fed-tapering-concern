Australia ’s dollar rebounded from the
lowest since September 2010 on speculation its biggest quarterly
decline in almost five years was excessive and amid bets the
 Reserve Bank  will refrain from cutting rates tomorrow.  The currency’s one-month implied volatility against the
dollar was near the most in 1 1/2 years as investors weighed the
policy outlook locally and in the U.S. Demand for Aussie was
limited amid signs  China’s economy  is slowing and speculation
the  Federal Reserve  will reduce stimulus. The  New Zealand dollar 
rallied from a decline at the end of last week.  “I think the RBA is going to maintain their wait-and-see
rhetoric that they had in the last meeting,” said  Thomas Averill , a managing director in Sydney at Rochford Capital, a
currency and interest-rate risk-management company. “The fall
in Aussie will provide some stimulus into the economy itself. If
you start to see Aussie sub 90 and staying there, I think
interest-rate cuts from the RBA will become less likely.”  The Australian dollar rose 0.7 percent to 92.02 U.S. cents
as of 4:45 p.m. in Sydney, after touching 91.10 U.S. cents, the
lowest since September 2010. It lost 12 percent last quarter,
the biggest drop since the three months ended September 2008,
and weakened 4.5 percent in June.  The Aussie’s 14-day relative strength index versus the
greenback fell to 29 last week, below the 30 level some traders
see as a sign an asset’s price may reverse direction. The
currency pair’s one-month implied volatility rose 67 basis
points to 14.62 percent. It jumped to 15.46 percent on June 24,
a level unseen since December 2011.  ‘Weakness Ahead’  “The currency is becoming more volatile,” Tim Riddell,
the Singapore-based head of global markets research at  Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  said on a conference call
today. “As the day-to-day swings increase, the attractions of
carry trade become less advantageous. There’s probably more
weakness ahead in the short term.”  The Aussie gained 1.1 percent to 91.58 yen from the end of
last week, when it fell 0.7 percent. It was little changed at
NZ$1.1830 from June 28 after dropping to NZ$1.1753 on June 20,
the weakest since January 2009.  Swaps traders see a 23 percent chance the  Reserve Bank of
Australia  will cut  interest rates  at a policy meeting tomorrow.  The official  Purchasing Managers’ Index (CPMINDX)  of Chinese
manufacturing fell to 50.1 in June from 50.8 the previous month,
the government said today. The figure was in line with
economists’ estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  U.S. Economy  In the U.S., the  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory
index probably rose to 50.5 in June from 49, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey before the
data today.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled on June 19 the U.S.
central bank may “moderate” its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases, known as quantitative easing, later this year and end
it mid-2014 if economic improvement continues.  A  gauge  of Australian manufacturing rose to 49.6 last month
from 43.8 in May, the Australian Industry Group said in a survey
released today.  Consumer prices  rose 2.4 percent last month from
a year earlier after a 2.2 percent year-on year increase in May,
an index compiled by TD Securities Inc. and the Melbourne
Institute showed today.  The International Monetary Fund’s debut report on reserve-manager holdings of the Australian dollar revealed that the
currency may be vulnerable to quick outflows of capital that
would jeopardize the nation’s economy.  Reserves Data  The IMF said June 28 that global reserve managers such as
central banks held the equivalent of $99 billion in the first
quarter. The Australian government said last month foreign
investors owned A$206.8 billion ($189 billion) of its sovereign
securities. Before the IMF report, UBS AG strategists said that
so-called official accounts likely held the “lion’s share” of
the nation’s bonds, which should be reassuring because “their
investment horizons are measured in years, not days.”  The  yield  on Australia’s 10-year government bond rose six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.82 percent.  Moody’s Investors Service said Australia’s Aaa debt ratings
remain stable, citing economic resilience, government financial
strength and low susceptibility to event risk.  New Zealand ’s dollar added 0.5 percent to 77.76 U.S. cents
from June 28, when it capped a 7.6 percent quarterly drop. It
rose 0.9 percent to 77.42 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
