Profitable U.S. corporations paid an
average federal effective tax rate of 12.6 percent in 2010, less
than half the statutory rate of 35 percent, according to a study
released today by the Government Accountability Office.  The  GAO cited  several possible reasons for the finding,
including one-time benefits for capital investments made during
the economic recovery and taxes paid to foreign and state
governments. Companies’ effective tax rates were 13 percent in
2009 and 15.3 percent in 2008.  “This report underscores the need for comprehensive  tax
reform ,” Senator  Tom Coburn , an Oklahoma Republican, said in a
statement. “We would be better off with a code that eliminated
these loopholes so we can lower rates for both corporations and
individuals.”  Coburn requested the report along with Senator  Carl Levin ,
a Michigan Democrat, who said the report shows how
“unjustifiable loopholes and offshore gimmicks” shift the tax
burden to families and small businesses.  GAO used data from tax forms, specifically the companies’
reconciliation of their income for accounting and tax purposes.  Effective tax rates are higher -- as much as 22.7 percent -
- if money-losing companies are included in the calculation.
That’s because those losses lower the total amount of income
earned.  Lawmakers in both parties and President  Barack Obama 
support changes to the corporate tax system that would reduce
the 35 percent rate -- the industrialized world’s highest -- and
curtail tax breaks to offset the lost revenue.  The U.S. collected $191 billion in corporate taxes in 2010,
equal to 1.3 percent of gross domestic product, according to the
 Office of Management and Budget .  Corporate income tax collections peaked in nominal terms in
2007 at $370 billion. They dropped during the recession as
companies’ profits shrank and Congress created tax incentives to
encourage investment. They reached a bottom of $138 billion in
2009, according to OMB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
