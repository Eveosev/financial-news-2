Investec Plc (INVP) , the owner of a bank and
a  money manager  in South Africa and the U.K., more than
quadrupled Chief Executive Officer Stephen Koseff’s pay when he
received a bonus following a 28 percent increase in profit.  Koseff, 61, received salary and benefits of 450,000 pounds
($685,000) and a bonus of 1.5 million pounds, of which 1.2
million pounds was deferred, according to the Johannesburg- and
London-based company’s annual report, published on June 28. In
fiscal 2012, Koseff had the same 450,000-pound salary and
benefits, and waived his bonus after profit dropped and returns
touched a record low.  The CEO was granted the bonus “in light of the positive
financial performance of the group in 2013 and after
consideration of progress across a range of non-financial
measures,” Olivia Dickson, acting chairman of the compensation
committee, wrote in the annual report.  Managing Director Bernard Kantor and Finance Director Glynn Burger also received 1.5 million-pound bonuses, while a 4.4
million-pound bonus was paid to Hendrik du Toit, who heads the
company’s asset-management arm.  Koseff was  South Africa ’s highest-paid banker in 2011, even
as Investec posted the lowest returns among the country’s five
largest banks. Since January, Investec has been the country’s
best-performing bank stock this year, while Du Toit’s fund-management business posted record inflows for the year through
March. As many as 80 percent of analysts rate the stock a  buy ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Investec  rose  3 percent to 65.90 rand by the 5 p.m. close
in Johannesburg trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
