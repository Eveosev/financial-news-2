The  Kuwait Investment Authority  plans
to invest as much as $5 billion in infrastructure assets mainly
in the UK within the next three years to five years, the
Financial Times reported.  The KIA, the countryâ€™s sovereign wealth fund, is targeting
existing, heavily regulated infrastructure projects that
generate cash, the report said, citing Managing Director Bader Al-Saad.  The plan comes after the KIA and its partners last month
abandoned a 5.3 billion-pound ($8 billion) plan to take over
 Severn Trent Plc (SVT)  as the British water utility said the price was
too low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
