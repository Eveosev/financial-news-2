Gasoline and diesel gained on signs
that the global manufacturing outlook is improving and as  Brent
crude  strengthened.  Futures advanced as the  Institute for Supply Management ’s
factory index rose to 50.9 from May’s 49. Euro-area
manufacturing output contracted less than estimated in June and
Japanese manufacturers are optimistic for the first time in two
years. Brent gained after rates were reduced at a North Sea
Buzzard oil field.  “The oil market is seeing some support because Nexen is
having issues with Buzzard oil production and there has been
some good economic news,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow
Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  August-delivery gasoline gained 2.4 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $2.7396 a gallon at 9:58 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange on trading volume that was 55 percent below the 100-day
average. Prices slipped 0.4 percent last week and 1 percent in
June, the third consecutive monthly decline. Gasoline retreated
11 percent in the second quarter.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI slipped 17 cents to
$17.93 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  over Brent declined 11 cents
to $11.79.  Brent for August settlement rose $1.12 to $103.28 a barrel
on the London ICE Futures Exchange, increasing the cost to
process oil that is priced off the London benchmark. The Nexen
Inc.-operated 200,000-barrel-a-day Buzzard field is said to be
running at reduced rates, according to people with knowledge of
the matter.  Euro Manufacturing  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area
increased to 48.8 last month from 48.3 in May, London-based
Markit Economics said today. The quarterly  Tankan (JNTSMFG)  index for
large manufacturers rose to plus four in June from minus eight
in March, the  Bank of Japan  said in  Tokyo  today. A positive
figure means optimists outnumber pessimists.  “There was some good economic data this morning and the
Buzzard oil field is supporting the Brent crude,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.5 cent to $3.487 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.

gain in five months. Diesel dropped 1.2 percent in the first
quarter, the third consecutive quarterly loss.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
widened 22 cents to $23.73 a barrel. The  premium over Brent
