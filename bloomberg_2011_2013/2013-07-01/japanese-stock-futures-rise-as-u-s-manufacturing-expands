Japanese and Australian  stock futures 
rose after data showed U.S. manufacturing expanded more than
expected and the yen fell.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , a
carmaker that gets 31 percent of its revenue in  North America ,
gained 1.2 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those
of  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s second-largest construction
equipment maker, rose 0.9 percent. ADRs of China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp., a state-backed Chinese refiner, jumped 28
percent.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 13,915 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
13,870 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
13,930 in Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index rose 0.5 percent in Wellington.  “The manufacturing report wasn’t too strong to stoke
concern about stimulus tapering and gave a boost to the
market,” said  Toshihiko Matsuno , a strategist at Tokyo-based
SMBC Friend Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s second-biggest
lender by market value. “A weaker yen will boost exports and
help Japanese products sell abroad.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 9.4 percent through
yesterday from the closing level on May 20, which was the
highest since June 2008. The gauge  traded  at 12.8 times average
estimated earnings as of yesterday, compared with 14.7 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.8 times for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Manufacturing  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today after the index rose 0.5 percent in New York
yesterday. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s manufacturing
index increased to 50.9 in June from 49 a month earlier, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group said yesterday. The median forecast
of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for the measure to
rise to 50.5. A reading above 50 signals expansion.  The yen reached 99.86 per dollar yesterday, the lowest
since June 5. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas earnings
at Japanese companies.  Futures on  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.3 percent as
the market reopens today after a public holiday. Contracts on
the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies
trading in Hong Kong lost 0.1 percent.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. was  little changed  yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
