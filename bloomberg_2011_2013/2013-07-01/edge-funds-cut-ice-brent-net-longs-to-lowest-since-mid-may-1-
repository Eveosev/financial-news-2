Hedge funds and other money managers
cut  bullish bets  on Brent crude to the lowest level in six
weeks, according to data from ICE Futures Europe.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 136,809 lots in
the week ended June 25, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitments of Traders report. The decrease of 48,844
contracts, or 26 percent, is the biggest fall in percentage
terms since June 5, 2012 and brings net-long positions to the
lowest since May 14.  Bearish positions by  producers , merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 350,458 lots,
falling 11 percent from the previous week to their lowest net-short position since May 14.  Brent fell 4.5 percent in the week to June 25 to $101.26,
and traded at $102.96 a barrel as of 1:09 p.m. London time.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators as well as commercial
companies that buy or sell futures to protect against price
moves. Analysts and investors follow changes in speculators’
positions because such transactions can reflect an expectation
of a change in prices.  Swaps dealers  were net-long 254,384 lots, up 5.5 percent,
to the highest in three weeks.  Money managers’ net-long bets on European  gasoil  futures
decreased for the first time in three weeks, by 7,664 contracts,
or 29 percent, to 18,512, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
