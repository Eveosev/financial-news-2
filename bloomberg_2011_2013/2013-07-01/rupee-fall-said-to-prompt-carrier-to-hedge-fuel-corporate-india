Air India Ltd. plans to hedge  jet
fuel  for the first time in five years as the rupee’s fall to a
record boosts costs for the airline that’s striving to narrow
losses, two company officials familiar with the matter said.  The airline has decided to start locking in fuel prices
once  Brent crude  drops below $100 a barrel, according to the
officials, who asked not to be identified, citing company
policy. Brent for August settlement rose 6 cents to $103.06 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at 1:30
p.m. Sydney time. The airline may also go for currency hedges if
the rupee weakens further against the  U.S. dollar , one of the
officials said.  The rupee’s 8.6 percent depreciation last quarter boosts
foreign expenses, masking repatriated gains from higher value of
tickets  Air India  sells overseas. The airline’s domestic fuel
bills are also dollar-based, and hence the greenback’s gain
hurts efforts to return to profit after six consecutive years of
losses through March 31, said one of the officials.  “The key to lowering costs lies in efficiently choosing
several options that give the maximum benefit,” said Mark D. Martin, chief executive officer of Dubai-based Martin Consulting
LLC that advises airlines on cost optimization. “Hedging fuel
makes sense, while doing the same with currency helps safeguard
from cost over-runs.”  Hedging jet fuel is one of the options that will help Air
India in its turnaround plan, G. Prasada Rao, a spokesman for
the state-run carrier, said. He declined to comment specifically
whether the company has decided to hedge for fuel.  AirAsia Entry  AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA) , the region’s biggest discount carrier that is
setting up an Indian venture, hedged 35 percent of its fuel
consumption as of March 31, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  has hedged 57 percent of its
fuel needs for the year ending March.  Most European airlines are hedging at least 75 percent of
their jet fuel needs, according to data from nine carriers
compiled by Bloomberg. Ryanair Holdings Plc, Europe’s biggest
discount airline, has hedged 90 percent of its fuel requirements
for the year through March 2014.  High  fuel prices  and cut-rate fares have pushed Indian
carriers into losses even after passenger traffic more than
doubled in the past seven years. Airlines in  India  lost about
$1.65 billion in the year ended March 31, according to  CAPA 
Centre for Aviation, a Sydney-based consultant.  Air India, based in  Mumbai , last hedged fuel in 2008. The
quantity hedged was less than 10 percent of its total
consumption, according to one of the officials.  Narrower Loss  Air India narrowed losses to 52 billion rupees ($873
million) in the year ended March from a record 75.6 billion
rupees a year earlier. It targets to further reduce losses this
year to 39.9 billion rupees, Chairman Rohit Nandan said May 14.  The rupee fell to an all-time low of 60.765 per dollar on
June 26 after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
on June 19 the monetary stimulus, which has fueled demand for
emerging-market assets, may end next year. The Indian currency
rose 0.3 percent to 59.3650 a dollar at 10:14 a.m.  The rupee’s one-month implied volatility has surged 452
basis points last quarter, the most since September 2011,
indicating greater risks of exchange-rate swings. The rate rose
25 basis points to 12.34 percent today.  Jet kerosene prices in  Singapore  declined 7.1 percent this
year, while Brent crude has fallen 7.4 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Air India expects crude to rebound
to $110 a barrel later this year, one of the officials said.  Brent, which dropped 7.1 percent in the second quarter, may
extend its decline because of technical resistance, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “In hedging, some are very lucky and some turn out very
unfortunate,” said Harsh Vardhan, chairman of New Delhi-based
Starair Consulting that advises airlines. “Air India must have
its own reasons to go for it.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
