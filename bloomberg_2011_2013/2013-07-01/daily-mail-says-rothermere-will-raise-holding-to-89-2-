Daily Mail & General Trust Plc (DMGT) , the
publisher of Britain’s second-biggest U.K. daily newspaper, said
a trust for the Rothermere family agreed to raise its voting
stake to 89.2 percent from 59.9 percent.  The voting shares are rarely traded by the family on the
stock market. Rothermere Continuation Ltd. will buy the
shareholding of the Esmond Harmsworth 1998 Settlement in the
ordinary voting shares, Daily Mail said in a statement today.
Daily Mail’s independent directors have also received an
approach from Rothermere about a possible offer for the
remaining ordinary voting shares, the publisher said.  Rothermere Continuation is owned by a trust for Daily Mail
Chairman Viscount Rothermere and his immediate family. The Daily
Mail newspaper was started in 1896 by Harold Harmsworth, who was
the first Viscount Rothermere, and his brother Alfred, according
to the London-based company’s website. It had a circulation of
about 1.8 million in May.  The Esmond Harmsworth 1998 Settlement’s ordinary voting
stock will be exchanged for Class A ordinary non-voting shares
owned by Rothermere at a ratio of 112.5 Class A shares for every
100 ordinary voting shares. Any Rothermere offer for the
remaining voting stock would be on the same terms, according to
the statement.  Discussions between Rothermere and the independent
directors are at an early stage and there is no certainty that
an offer will be made, the company said.  Daily Mail Class A shares rose as much as 2.4 percent and
were up 0.8 percent at 776 pence at 10:35 a.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
