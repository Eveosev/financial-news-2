Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN) , the
biggest manager of U.K. pension assets, said it will pay three
of its executive directors 21 percent more in base salary.  Chief Financial Officer Mark Gregory, who starts his job
today; John Pollock, who runs the firm’s protection and
annuities business, and Mark Zinkula, chief of Legal & General
Investment Management, will be paid 560,000 pounds ($853,000),
beginning today. Chief Executive Officer Nigel Wilson won’t see
a basic pay increase until March, the London-based firm said in
a statement today.  Pollock and Zinkula were given broader responsibilities,
reflecting the pay increase, Legal & General said. Pollock will
manage the company’s savings business, while Zinkula will
oversee the firm’s unit trust fund business.  “We aim for overall remuneration to be competitively
positioned around the mid-market range in relation to the FTSE
100 with particular regard to insurers and other financial
institutions,” the company said in the statement.  In the U.S., compensation for CFOs rose by 3.5 percent at
publicly traded companies and 3.1 percent at closely held firms
this year, according to a survey from  Grant Thornton  and the
Financial Executives Research Foundation published in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
