Bill Perkins, the founder of Skylar
Capital Management LP, collected almost $2 million by placing
third in a charity tournament at the  World Series  of Poker, the
top finish by a non-professional player.  Anthony Gregg, a 26-year-old poker pro from Columbia,
 Maryland ,  won the $4.8 million top prize  on June 29 after four
days of playing the “One Drop High Roller” at the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino in  Las Vegas . There were 166 participants
in the no-limit Texas hold’em tournament, which had a $111,111
buy-in.  Gregg knocked out Perkins, who started Houston-based Skylar
last year, before eliminating fellow pro Chris Klodnicki heads-up for the winner’s bracelet. Antonio Esfandiari, a poker pro
who won the $18.3 million top prize last year when the charity
event included a $1 million buy-in, finished fourth and received
more than $1.4 million.  Perkins, 44, entered the final day as the chip leader and
was eliminated after 13 hands.  After Esfandiari was knocked out, Gregg doubled his stack
of chips at Perkins’s expense nine hands in. Four hands later,
Perkins went all-in and Gregg’s ace-queen combination was enough
to beat Perkins’s ace-five.  It was the 47th of 62 poker tournaments that make up this
year’s World Series, which concludes with the $10,000 buy-in No-Limit Texas Hold’Em World Championship, known as the main event.  To contact the reporter on this story:
