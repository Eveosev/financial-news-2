Saudi  Prince Alwaleed bin Talal , the
world’s 15th richest person, told a London court in a lawsuit
over a $10 million commission on an airplane sale that he had a
strong relationship with former Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  Alwaleed, testifying today, said he met with Qaddafi in a
Tripoli tent to ensure the 2006 sale of his private airliner was
completed. Alwaleed is being sued by Jordanian businesswoman
Daad Sharab over claims he failed to pay the commission on the
$120 million sale of the A340.  “My relationship with Qaddafi goes much deeper than the
plane,” Alwaleed, 58, told the court today.  The testimony today focused on the relationship between
Alwaleed and Qaddafi, the Libyan leader who was overthrown and
killed in October 2011 in a U.S.-backed rebellion. Alwaleed,
founder of Riyadh-based  Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , said a commission
wasn’t appropriate because of his own role in the sale.  Sharab was “overwhelmingly concerned with her own position
and relationship with the Libyans,” he said in a witness
statement. “I was irritated by her attitude and her apparent
attempt to play both sides against each other.”  Alwaleed said that while Sharab played a part in the sale,
he didn’t want to “exaggerate” it.  “You are deliberately minimizing” Sharab’s role in the
negotiations, Clive Freedman, her lawyer, said during cross-examination.  To contact the reporter on this story:
