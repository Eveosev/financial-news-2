Iberdrola SA (IBE) ,  Spain ’s biggest power
utility, completed sales of assets in  Chile  and the
Mediterranean, raising its tally of divestments in the past year
to more than 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion).  The utility, which operated in the Latin American country
through Empresa Electrica Lican SA, sold its 55 percent stake
for $55 million to ICL, Iberdrola’s partner in Lican, according
to a company official who asked not to be named, as the deal
wasn’t officially announced. Also Iberdrola completed selling
its final 10.6 percent stake in the Medgaz pipeline for 76.3
million euros, it said today in a filing.  The latest sales, including $264 million of Polish wind
assets in February, mean the Bilbao-based utility has now sold
1.2 billion euros of non-strategic assets since last year, as
part of Chairman  Ignacio Galan ’s plan to sell up to 2 billion
euros of assets through 2014 to strengthen the balance sheet and
reduce debt.  Through the sale of Lican, which operates a  17-megawatt  
hydropower plant, the company has withdrawn from its investments
in Chile, a process begun by selling a controlling stake in
Iberoamericana de Energia Ibener SA in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
