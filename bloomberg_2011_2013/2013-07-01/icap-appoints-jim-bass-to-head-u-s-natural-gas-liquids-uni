ICAP Plc (IAP) ’s energy-brokerage unit
appointed Jim Bass to head its expansion into the U.S. natural
gas-liquids market, the company said in a statement.  Bass, a broker of physical NGLs with more than 20 years of
experience, previously ran Bass Liquids LLC.  ICAP said it’s expanding into NGLs, which include
hydrocarbons such as propane, ethane, butane and pentanes, as
supplies surge as a byproduct of natural gas production from
shale deposits.  U.S. gas output will grow for the sixth consecutive year as
new wells are brought online at shale reserves such as the
Marcellus in the Northeast, according to the Energy Information
Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department.  Marketed production will increase 1.2 percent to a record
70.01 billion cubic feet a day versus 2012, the EIA said in its
June 11  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  To contact the reporter on this story:
