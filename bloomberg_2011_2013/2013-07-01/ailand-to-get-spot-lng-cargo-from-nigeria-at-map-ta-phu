PTT Pcl (PTT) ,  Thailand ’s importer of
liquefied natural gas, is set to receive a spot cargo from
 Nigeria  at its Map Ta Phut terminal, a company official said.  The Methane Rita Andrea, with capacity of about 145,000
cubic meters, will arrive today at the Gulf of Thailand
terminal, said the official. He asked not to be identified
because he isn’t authorized to speak to the media. The tanker
loaded its cargo at Nigeria LNG Ltd.’s terminal at Bonny Island
and departed on June 7, according to ship transmissions captured
by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg.  PTT owns and operates the Map Ta Phut terminal in Rayong,
which has a capacity of 5 million metric tons a year. The
company,  Southeast Asia ’s first LNG importer, signed its initial
long-term contract with Qatargas in December 2012 for 2 million
tons annually for 20 years starting in 2015, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  PTT needs to buy as much as 2 million tons of spot LNG this
year to meet power-industry demand, the official said on April
12. In May, the company purchased two July cargoes through its
fourth tender this year, according to the official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
