Crude oil options volatility fell for
a fifth straight day as the underlying futures rose.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in

gauge of options, settled at 19.35 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, down from 19.7 percent June 28.  West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery rose
$1.43 to close at $97.99 a barrel on the Nymex.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
August $95 puts, which fell 54 cents to 58 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,589 lots traded. August $92 puts were the second-most active, down 23 cents to 21 cents a barrel on volume of
2,234 contracts.  Puts accounted for 59 percent of electronic trading volume
and were the four most widely traded contracts. In the prior
session, bearish bets were 56 percent of 100,921 contracts.  August $95 puts were the most-active options traded June
28, with 3,445 contracts changing hands. They rose 2 cents to
$1.12 a barrel. December $90 puts gained 9 cents to $3.32 a
barrel on 3,161 lots.  Open interest was highest for September $85 puts, with
