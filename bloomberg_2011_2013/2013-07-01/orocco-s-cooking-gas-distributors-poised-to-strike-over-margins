Moroccan cooking gas distributors may
stage strikes as early as this week to pressure the Islamist-led
government to increase distribution margins, two senior industry
representatives said.  “Our margins have not changed since 1998,” Mohamed
Benjelloun, chairman of the Moroccan Gas Distributors
Association, said in a phone interview yesterday from
Casablanca. “Our 500-odd members have decided that they can no
longer wait and strikes may happen.”  The threat increases pressure on the government’s subsidy
reform plan for energy, sugar and wheat flour prices that has
been stymied by strong opposition from its junior coalition
partners and fear of a social backlash. Morocco opened its
coffers during Arab Spring protests two years ago, increasing
subsidy spending, public-sector wages and pensions. Its current-account deficit reached 10 percent last year.  Distributors are seeking to increase margins by at least
0.5 dirham for a 3-kilogram canister and 1.5 dirhams for a 12-kilogram canister, according to the association’s vice chairman
Yahya Madani. Eliminating the subsidy on cooking gas would push
the retail price of the larger canister rise from 42 dirhams to
over 120 dirhams, the two officials said.  A first warning strike of as long as 48 hours will be
staged at the start of fasting month of Ramadan, expected to
begin in the second week of July, Madani said by phone from
Tangier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
