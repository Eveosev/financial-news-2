The Philippine peso rose for a fifth
day on speculation a rally in the benchmark  stock index  will
attract more overseas funds.  Foreign investors bought $91 million more shares than they
sold last week, having been net sellers in the previous three
weeks, exchange data show. The Philippine Stock Exchange
 Composite Index (PCOMP)  climbed 1.3 percent today, a fourth day of gains.
Bonds due 2031 declined.  “There have been some positive flows coming to the
 Philippines ,” said Rafael Algarra, executive vice president and
head of financial markets at Security Bank Corp. in Manila.
“Fundamentally, the Philippines is still showing positive
economic figures.”  The peso appreciated 0.3 percent to 43.063 per dollar as of
12:15 p.m. in Manila and touched 43.060, the strongest level
since June 18, Tullett Prebon Plc data show. The peso lost 5.5
percent last quarter, the third-worst performance in  Asia  after
the Indian rupee and  Thai baht .  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, declined nine basis
points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 7.8 percent today.  Gross domestic product increased 7.8 percent in the first
quarter, the fastest in Asia, while Economic Planning Secretary
Arsenio Balisacan told reporters last week in Manila that growth
this year will be within the 6 percent to 7 percent target.  The government reports May remittances data for Filipinos
working abroad on July 15. The funds, which contribute about 10
percent to the Philippine economy, increased 6.1 percent in
April from a year earlier, central bank figures showed June 17.  The yield on the 8 percent sovereign bonds due July 2031
rose 13 basis points to 4.95 percent, according to prices from
