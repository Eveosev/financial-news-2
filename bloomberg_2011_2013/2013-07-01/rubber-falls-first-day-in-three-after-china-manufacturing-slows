Rubber futures in  Tokyo  declined for
the first time in three days after manufacturing expanded at the
slowest pace in four months in  China , the largest consumer of
the commodity used in tires.  The contract for delivery in December slipped as much as 1
percent to 233.9 yen a kilogram ($2,356 a metric ton) on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange and was at 234.8 yen at 12:13 p.m.
local time. Futures lost 14 percent last quarter, the biggest
decline in a year.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was at 50.1, the National
Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said today in Beijing. That was down from May’s 50.8.
Readings above 50 signal expansion. Weaker gains in
manufacturing add to odds that Li Keqiang will become the first
premier to miss an annual growth target since the Asian
financial crisis in 1998.  “The yen-driven rally in rubber lost steam as concerns
about Chinese demand strengthened,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst
at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  China’s expansion probably slowed for a second straight
quarter, based on the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
analyst survey, after export growth collapsed and Li reined in
record credit expansion to contain shadow-banking risks.  Global rubber stockpiles will probably expand to the
highest in more than a decade as slower economic growth damps
demand, according to The Rubber Economist.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 0.8 percent to 17,875  yuan  ($2,916) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board gained 0.9 percent to 86.15 baht ($2.78) a
kilogram June 28, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
 Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
