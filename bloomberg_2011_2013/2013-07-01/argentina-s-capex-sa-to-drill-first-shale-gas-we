Capex SA, the Argentine natural gas
and power producer that has declined 21 percent this year, will
drill its first shale well this month, Chief Financial Officer
Claudia Biasotti said.  The well will be in the company’s Agua del Cajon gas field,
part of the Vaca Muerta shale formation in Neuquen province.
Capex has an agreement with Houston-based  Halliburton Co. (HAL) , for
the hydraulic fracturing of 11 wells, she said in a telephone
interview yesterday.  Capex, based in Buenos Aires, is also seeking to boost the
price at which it sells newly discovered gas to the government
by potentially recreating a power-rate compromise it reached on
May 31. Under that agreement, Capex said it wouldn’t sue the
government for a decade of frozen rates in exchange for a higher
electricity tariff. The company is holding talks with the
Argentine government about a similar deal that may triple the
price it gets for the new gas.  “If we get a deal for new gas, our balance sheet will show
additional benefits soon,” Biasotti said. “The red figures we
posted in the last few quarters will be reversed.”  Capex on Jan. 31 posted a nine-month loss of 70.2 million
pesos ($13 million). The company reported a 6 percent decline in
gas output for the same period, dropping to 501 million cubic
meters from 531.3 million a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
