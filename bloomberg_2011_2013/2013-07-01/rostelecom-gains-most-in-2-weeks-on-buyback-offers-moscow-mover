OAO Rostelecom headed for the biggest
gain in almost two weeks as  Russia ’s largest fixed-line operator
started accepting offers from shareholders after proposing to
buy back stock at a premium to the market.  Rostelecom increased as much as 2.4 percent, rising 1.8
percent to 89.76 rubles by 4:13 p.m. in Moscow and poised for
the biggest advance since June 17. The amount of shares trading
was 1.8 million, equivalent to about 45 percent of the three-month average.  The company started accepting buyout offers from investors
who didn’t vote or voted against its merger with OAO Svyazinvest
from June 27 and will continue until Aug. 12, according to a
statement. The company set a buyout price for its ordinary
shares at 136.05 rubles ($4.12) apiece, it said in a March 27
 announcement .  “The share buyout is the key driver for Rostelecom’s stock
right now,” Sergey Libin, an analyst at ZAO Raiffeisenbank,
said by phone from Moscow. “The company is offering a very good
premium to the market price.”  The  record date  for holders of Rostelecom shares to
participate in the buyout was May 15. Rostelecom has fallen 23
percent since then.  “Speculators who made the May 15 record date may have sold
the stock afterwards and are now buying it back at a cheaper
price so they can reap a higher premium,” Konstantin Chernyshev, an analyst at UralSib Capital, said by phone from
Moscow.  Shareholders representing 62 percent of Rostelecom’s
ordinary and preferred capital  participated  in the vote on June
26, with 98 percent of the voting shareholders supporting the
merger with Svyazinvest, according to the June 27 statement.  The company set a price of 95.24 rubles a share for its
preferred stock, which traded down 1.5 percent at 73.04 rubles
today. The volume of preferred shares traded was about 62,000 or
13 percent of the three-month daily average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
