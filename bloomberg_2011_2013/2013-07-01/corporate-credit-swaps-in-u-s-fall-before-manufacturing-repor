A gauge of U.S corporate credit risk
fell as data showed manufacturing rebounded in June to a three-month high after its largest contraction since 2009.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
2.7 basis points to a mid-price of 84.4 basis points at 4:05
p.m. in  New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure, which plunged 6.9 basis points last week, the biggest
drop since the five days ended Jan. 4, is poised for the lowest
closing level since June 18.  The gauge has declined from a six-month, intraday high of
99.8 on June 24 as investor speculation has eased that the
 Federal Reserve  will soon start to reduce its $85 billion
monthly bond purchases, which have bolstered credit markets. The
 Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index rose to 50.9 in
June, signaling an economy that’s growing, while not so fast as
to impel the central bank to slow the pace of bond buying.  “When you have ISM coming in slightly above 50, that means
there’s expansion, but only modestly,” Krishna Memani, chief
investment officer of fixed income at OppenheimerFunds Inc. in
New York, said in a telephone interview. “Getting to the Fed’s
objective  unemployment rate  is still far in the future and
easing should likely continue.”  Modest Expansion  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19 that the Fed may
start to reduce its bond purchases this year and end them in
2014 if economic growth is in line with the central bank’s
estimates.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  has said it will keep its
benchmark  interest rate  close to zero as long as unemployment
exceeds 6.5 percent and the outlook for inflation is no more
than 2.5 percent.  A July 5 report from the Labor Department may show that the
unemployment rate fell to 7.5 percent in June from 7.6 percent
the prior month, according to the median forecast of analysts in
a Bloomberg survey. Non-farm payrolls may increase by 165,000
workers in June after rising 175,000 in May.  ISM Index  The ISM factory index rose to 50.9 in June from 49 a month
earlier, above the 50 mark which divides expansion from
contraction, according to a report today from the Tempe,
Arizona-based group. The median forecast of 85 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg called for an increase to 50.5. The May figure was
the lowest since 45.8 in June 2009.  The  risk premium  on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index fell 17.9 basis points to 417.6 basis points,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The average relative yield on speculative-grade, or junk-rated, debt declined 1.9 basis points to 582.6 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below
Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and less than BBB- at  Standard
& Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
