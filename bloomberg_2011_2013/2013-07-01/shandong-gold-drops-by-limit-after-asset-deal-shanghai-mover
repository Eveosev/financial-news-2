Shandong Gold Mining Co. (600547)  plunged by a
record in Shanghai trading after the company said it plans to
buy about 13 billion  yuan  ($2.1 billion) of assets from its
parent and four other parties.  Shares of  China ’s second-largest gold company by value
plunged the daily limit of 10 percent to 28.77 yuan. That’s the
most since the stock began trading Aug. 28, 2003. Shandong had
been suspended since April 3.  Shandong Gold will fund the purchase of the production and
mining assets through a 9.98 billion yuan share swap, it said in
an exchange filing on June 28. It will raise as much as 3
billion yuan through a private share sale to 10 unidentified
investors to fund the remainder, it said.  The assets to be acquired were valued at 313.01 yuan a gram
($1,588 an ounce) based on the average spot gold price on the
Shanghai Gold Exchange between Jan. 2010 and March 31 this year,
Shandong Gold said in the statement. The  spot price  for 99.99
percent pure gold last traded at 251.76 yuan a gram on the
exchange and is down 21 percent since Shandong Gold shares were
halted in April.  “There’s concern the assets have been overvalued as they
used average prices between 2010 and March 2013 to measure the
resources, while gold has extended its drop after that,” Ming
Lufa, an analyst at Founder Securities Co., said from Beijing.
“Shandong Gold also dropped to catch up the recent declines in
the broader stock market.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  has fallen 12 percent since
Shandong Gold’s stock suspension amid a cash squeeze in China’s
banking system that spurred Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and China
International Capital Corp. to cut their 2013 growth forecast
for the second-largest economy. The benchmark  stock index  fell
0.8 percent today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
