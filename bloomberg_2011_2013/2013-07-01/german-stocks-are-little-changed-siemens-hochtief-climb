German stocks  were little changed,
after the  DAX Index (DAX)  posted a monthly loss, as investors awaited
reports on manufacturing in the euro area and the U.S.  Siemens AG (SIE)  rose 2.2 percent after Nokia Oyj agreed to buy
the German company’s stake in their joint venture for 1.7
billion euros ($2.2 billion).  Hochtief AG (HOT)  gained 2 percent after
selling its solutions business to SPIE SA for about 250 million
euros.  The benchmark DAX Index added 0.1 percent to 7,968 at 9:48
a.m. in Frankfurt. The gauge declined 4.7 percent in June as the
Federal Reserve signaled it may start to pare stimulus if the
 U.S. economy  continued to strengthen. The broader HDAX Index
also added 0.1 percent today.  A report at 10 a.m. Frankfurt time may show euro-area
manufacturing continued to shrink in June. The final reading for
last month came in at 48.7, according to economists in a
Bloomberg survey forecast. A reading below 50 signals
contraction.  In the U.S., the  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory
index probably rose to 50.5 in June from 49 in the previous
month, which was the lowest since June 2009, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  In China, an official PMI dropped to 50.1, the lowest level
in four months, from 50.8 in May, the National Bureau of
Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
