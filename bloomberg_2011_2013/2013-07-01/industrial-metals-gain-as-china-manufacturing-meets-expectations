Copper gained as some investors said
a slowdown in manufacturing in  China , the biggest user, had been
factored into prices after the biggest quarterly drop in almost
two years. Aluminum, zinc, lead and nickel also climbed.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.6 percent to $6,790 a metric ton and
was at $6,769.25 by 11:08 a.m. in  Shanghai . The price fell 10
percent in the second quarter, the most since the three months
through September 2011.  The official  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was at 50.1 in
June, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics
and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing. The reading
matched the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Another
index issued by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics stood at
48.2, compared with expectations for 48.3. Readings below 50
signal contraction.  “The slowdown in China has been priced in,” Wang
Jingjing, an analyst at Founder Futures co., said by phone from
Shanghai. “Copper is rebounding toward $7,000.”  China’s new home prices jumped in June by the most since
they reversed declines in December, according to  SouFun Holdings
Ltd. (SFUN) , the country’s biggest real estate website owner, citing
their survey of 100 cities.  Copper for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed 0.4 percent to 48,790  yuan  ($7,959) a ton.  Metal for delivery in September on the Comex was little
changed at $3.062 a pound. Net-short positions, or wagers on
falling Comex prices, held by funds expanded to 32,599 futures
and options as of June 25 from 29,018 a week earlier, according
to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
