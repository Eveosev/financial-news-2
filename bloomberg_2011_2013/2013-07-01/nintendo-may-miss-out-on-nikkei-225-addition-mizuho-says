Nintendo Co., the world’s biggest
maker of game consoles, is probably too big to be included in
the Nikkei 225 Stock Average this year, according to analysts at
 Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  and  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)   Nikkei Inc., which manages the equity benchmark, said last
week it will consider adding some of the most active stocks
listed on the Osaka Securities Exchange after the bourse merges
with the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange on July 16. Nintendo, which counts
Osaka as its primary exchange,  jumped  7 percent on June 28, the
day after the announcement.  The maker of the Wii gaming console has a market value of
1.6 trillion yen ($16 billion) and traded at 11,750 yen a share
as of today’s close in Tokyo. With a 3.3 percent weight on the
Nikkei 225, it may be considered too large by the measure’s
compilers, Nomura quantitative analysts led by Tomoyo Izumi and
Mizuho analysts headed by Hayato Nagayoshi wrote on June 28.  “The inclusion of highly priced stocks will impact other
companies on the measure and even the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
as a whole,” wrote Nomura’s Izumi. “This may be what keeps it
off the benchmark.”  The weighting would make Nintendo the fourth-most
influential stock on the Nikkei 225 after Fast Retailing Co.,
Softbank Corp. and Fanuc Corp., respectively, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavily weighted shares can leave an
index vulnerable to swings from a single company. Fast
Retailing, Asia’s biggest apparel retailer, was responsible for
almost a sixth of the gauge’s 32 percent advance this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nikkei Skew  The skew in the Nikkei 225 caused by an individual company
underscores the difference between stock averages, where ranking
is determined by a share price, and most indexes, where market
capitalization is key. The 62-year-old equity benchmark is the
most common gauge for pricing derivatives on the country’s $4.2
trillion equity market.  Mitsubishi Paper Mills Ltd. (3864) , Heiwa Real Estate Co.,  Takara
Holdings Inc. (2531) ,  Tokyo Dome Corp. (9681) , Furukawa Co. may be removed
from the Nikkei 225 as they are the least actively traded stocks
on the gauge, Mizuho and Nomura said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
