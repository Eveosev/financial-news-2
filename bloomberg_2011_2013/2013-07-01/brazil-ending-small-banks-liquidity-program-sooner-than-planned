Brazil ’s central bank is bringing
forward the termination date on a program of incentives granted
to large banks to encourage the transfer of liquidity to smaller
institutions through asset purchases.  The measures to date helped inject more than 46 billion
reais ($20.6 billion) into smaller banks, bringing their
liquidity to “desired levels,” according to a statement posted
on the central bank’s website today. The program, announced in
December 2011, will finish in March 2014 -- five months earlier
than originally intended.  “This suggests that the health of the financial system,
especially medium and smaller banks, is good enough for the
standards of our central bank, so it’s safe to end this
program,”  Andre Perfeito , chief economist at Gradual
Investimentos, said by telephone from Sao Paulo. “The medium
and small-size banks are not in danger in Brazil.”  The shift in reserve rules was an attempt by policy makers
to prop up smaller banks squeezed by Europe’s debt crisis after
Brazil’s deposit fund stepped in to facilitate the 2010 bailout
of  Banco Panamericano SA. (BPNM3)  President  Dilma Rousseff  has lowered
banks’ reserve requirements in a bid to boost lending while at
the same time pressuring the institutions to reduce their
spreads.  The rules allowed banks to use part of their reserve
requirements to purchase credit portfolios and longer-term bonds
from banks whose capital does not exceed 2.2 billion reais.
Failing to do so would result in punishment by way of losing
interest payments on some of the funds required to be deposited
at the central bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
