Treasury 10-year note yields may
reach 3 percent a year from now as economic growth accelerates,
said Edward Keon of Prudential Financial Inc.  U.S. gross national product expansion may increase to a 5
percent annual rate, up from a forecast 1.9 percent pace this
year, said Keon, portfolio manager and managing director of
 Newark , New Jersey-based Quantitative Management Associates LLC,
a unit of Prudential Financial, in a phone interview. Swifter
growth will emerge as the economy escapes the restraints of
automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration, and a higher
payroll income-tax rate, which were implemented to restrain
growth in the  U.S. federal debt , he said.  “The  U.S. economy  has been like Secretariat with a sumo
wrestler as a jockey,” Keon said at a news conference in  New
York  last week. “If you assume that the tax increase knocked us
down 2.5 percent of GDP, and you have another direct impact of 1
percent from the spending cuts, that is about a 3.5 percent
swing to the negative. You combine the current 1.8 percent
growth with a 3.5 percent GDP rebound, and you get to the 5
percent number.”  Keon’s forecast for a 3 percent 10-year note yield exceeds
the median forecast for a 2.7 percent yield in the second
quarter of 2014, in a Bloomberg News survey of 70 analysts. The
yield was little changed at 2.48 percent in New York, according
to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  Automatic across-the-board budget cuts of $85.4 billion and
the expiration of the payroll tax cut in 2012 will lead to a 0.6
percent annual reduction in GDP for calendar year 2013,
according to the  Congressional Budget Office .  “I would expect yields to drift higher if I’m right that
the economy turns out to be stronger than most people think,”
said Keon, who manages $50 billion in asset-allocation funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
