Moog Inc. (MOG/A)  said it will work with RBC
Capital Markets LLC to evaluate options for its medical devices
division including a possible sale. The shares advanced.  Moog also completed the sale of its Ethox Medical business
to Dempsey Ventures for an undisclosed sum, according to a
statement today. The divestiture will result in an after-tax
non-cash loss of about $5 million, or 11 cents a share, in the
quarter ended June 29, East Aurora, New York-based Moog said.  Revenue at Moog’s medical device segment last year fell 1.7
percent to $140 million, the equivalent of 5.7 percent of the
company’s $2.5 billion in total sales. Moog’s biggest unit,
which manufactures aircraft controls, had $963.4 million in
sales last year.  The  shares  rose 2.7 percent to $52.91 at 10:21 a.m. in  New
York , after reaching $53.30, the highest intraday price since at
least 1988.  Dempsey Ventures, based in  Grand Rapids , Michigan, is a
private-equity firm focused on health-care products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
