Vitol Group is taking delivery of
about 144,000 metric tons of raw sugar following the expiry of
ICE Futures U.S.’s July contract, according to two people with
direct knowledge of the matter.  The company owns 2,835 futures contracts, each representing
112,000 pounds (50.8 tons), said the people, asking not to be
identified because they aren’t authorized to talk to the media.
Andrea Schlaepfer, a spokeswoman for Vitol in London, declined
to comment. ICE confirmed the size of the delivery today.  Bunge Ltd. (BG)  is among the sellers, delivering 197 futures,
according to two people familiar with the transactions, who also
asked not to be named.  Susan Burns , a spokeswoman for the  White
Plains , New York-based company, said by e-mail today that Bunge
doesn’t comment on commercial contracts.  The July contract expired June 28 at 16.38 cents a pound.
The 2,835 contracts delivered is the smallest for July since
2006, bourse data show. The sugar will come from ports in
Argentina, El Salvador and Mexico, ICE said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
