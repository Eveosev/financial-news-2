Spain ’s government bonds rose, with
10-year securities advancing for a fifth day, after an index of
manufacturing in the nation increased in June more than
economists forecast.  Similar-maturity Italian bonds advanced for a fourth day.
European Central Bank policy makers hold their monthly meeting
in  Frankfurt  on July 4.  Germany ’s government bonds were little
changed as a report showed inflation in the euro area
accelerated for a second month in June. The Netherlands
auctioned 3.04 billion euros ($4 billion) of three- and 12-month
bills and  France  also sold short-term debt.  “Yields in Spain and  Italy  are coming down again after
some capitulation in risk assets,” said Allan von Mehren, chief
analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “There are signs the
fundamental situation is improving. I think the ECB is going to
send a message that it is going to keep  interest rates  low for a
very long time.”  Spain’s 10-year yield dropped 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 4.61 percent at 4:44 p.m.  London  time. The
rate climbed to 5.13 percent last week, the  most  since March 28.
The 4.4 percent security due October 2023 rose 1.25, or 12.50
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 98.325.  Italian 10-year yields dropped 12 basis points to 4.43
percent.  An  index  based on a survey of purchasing managers in
Spain’s manufacturing industry climbed to 50 from 48.1 in May,
London-based Markit Economics said. The median estimate of 10
analysts in a Bloomberg survey called for 48.5. The index had
been below the 50 level that represents the dividing line
between expansion and contraction for the past 25 months,
according to Markit.  Inflation Rate  The annual  inflation rate  in the 17-nation currency bloc
rose to 1.6 percent from 1.4 percent in May, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today, in line with
the median estimate in a separate survey. A gauge of  factory
output  in the 17-nation euro area improved more than economists
forecast in June.  “The PMIs were supportive for the periphery, particularly
for Spain given the 50 reading which indicates that contraction
in manufacturing has halted,” said Gianluca Ziglio, executive
director of fixed-income research at Sunrise Brokers LLP in
London. “If the ECB does not disappoint we should end the week
with lower yields.”  German 10-year yields were little changed at 1.72 percent
after climbing 22 basis points in June. The rate reached 1.85
percent on June 24, the  highest  level since April 4, 2012.  German Repayment  Germany will repay 22 billion euros to investors this week
when a 3.75 percent bond matures on July 4, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is a large bund redemption this week, which could
support countries such as Italy or Spain,” said  Patrick Jacq , a
senior fixed-income strategist at BNP Paribas SA in Paris.  Japonica Partners & Co., the U.S. investment firm that last
month said it would buy as much as 2.9 billion euros of Greece’s
government debt, offered to purchase more of the bonds at a
lower price amid speculation the country faces another bout of
economic instability.  Japonica said it will purchase as much as 4 billion euros
of Greek bonds, the Providence, Rhode Island-based firm said in
a statement today. The company, run by former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. investment banker Paul Kazarian, lowered its minimum
purchase price to 40 percent of the bonds’ principal amount,
down from 45 percent a month ago.  Greek Yield  The yield on  Greece ’s bond due in February 2023 fell three
basis points to 10.95 percent, up from 9.39 percent at the close
on May 31, the last trading day before Japonica first announced
its plans on June 3.  The Netherlands allotted 1.88 billion euros of three-month
bills at an average yield of minus 0.02 percent at an auction. A
negative yield means investors who hold the security until it
matures will receive less than they paid to buy it. The Dutch
State Treasury Agency also sold 12-month securities at 0.11
percent.  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of  Austria  and the Netherlands,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Spanish bonds returned 5.2 percent this year through June
28, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German securities
lost 1.7 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
