South African white-corn futures
declined to a one-month low.  White corn for delivery in July dropped 3.2 percent to
2,171 rand ($219) a metric ton, the lowest since May 22 by the
midday close in Johannesburg. It was the seventh drop in a row,
the longest streak since Feb. 11. The yellow variety for
delivery in the same month declined 3.5 percent to 2,142 rand a
ton, the lowest since May 21.  U.S. farmers seeded 97.4 million acres (39.4 million
hectares) of corn, the most since 1936, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  reported June 28. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had
expected 95.431 million.  South Africa  is the continentâ€™s largest producer of corn.
Meal from the white variety is a staple food while the yellow
kind is mainly used as  animal feed .  To contact the reporter on this story:
