A drop in U.S. high-yield bonds to a
12-month low last month may spell value, according to Margie Patel, a  money manager  at Wells Capital Management Inc.  “High-yield with this correction is actually very
attractive for long-term investors,” Boston-based Patel said
today in an interview on  Bloomberg Radio ’s “Surveillance” with
 Tom Keene  and  Michael McKee .  Yields on junk-rated debt have risen to their highest
levels this year after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben. S. Bernanke
said June 19 the central bank may begin reducing its $85 billion
in monthly bond purchases this year, marking a slowdown in
stimulus measures that pushed investors into riskier assets and
sent yields to unprecedented lows.  The average price on dollar-denominated high-yield debt
fell to 100.5 cents on June 25, the lowest since 100.47 cents on
June 30 2012, before reaching 101.47 cents on June 30, according
to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield index.
Prices have decreased from a record high of 107.22 cents on May
9.  The price adjustment was “much more than the correction in
equities,” Patel said. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  fell to
a nine-week low of 1,573.09 on June 24, down from an all-time
high of 1,669.16 on May 21, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The extra yield investors demand to own speculative-grade
corporate debt rather than government debentures reached 521
basis points on June 30, up from 423 basis points on May 10,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. Yields reached 7
percent on June 30, up from a record low 5.98 percent on May 9.  To contact the reporters on this story:
