Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG) , the U.K.
homebuilder focused on London and southeast England, bought a
10-acre (4-hectare) site in London from  Marks & Spencer Group
Plc (MKS)  for about 100 million pounds ($152 million).  Berkeleyâ€™s St. James Group unit will build homes on the
site in the White City district of the U.K. capital, replacing a
Marks & Spencer warehouse, the company said in a statement
today. Marks & Spencer will use the warehouse for another three
years while it searches for an alternative site.  Berkeley, based in Cobham, England, has profited from
acquiring land in the southeast of the country, where the
housing market escaped the worst effects of the global recession
in 2008 and mortgage lending has been less constrained.  London 
house prices climbed 0.9 percent in June from the previous
month, property researcher Hometrack Ltd. said in a report
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
