British and Irish Lions captain Sam Warburton was ruled out of next weekend’s series-deciding rugby
Test against  Australia  in Sydney because of injury.  Wales  flanker Warburton, 24, suffered “a significant
tear” in his left hamstring during the Lions’ 16-15 loss
against the Wallabies in Melbourne two days ago, the combined
team said in an e-mailed statement. The teams are tied at 1-1
heading into the July 6 third Test at ANZ Stadium.  “It is incredibly disappointing to be ruled out of the
tour through injury as we head to Sydney for the deciding
match,” Warburton, who will remain with the squad, said in the
statement. “I wish the team all the best and hope I can play
some part in the build-up this week. I am confident that the
boys can finish the job off and secure the series win.”  The loss of Warburton, who led Wales to back-to-back Six
Nations titles and the 2011 Rugby World Cup semifinals, comes as
the Lions seek their first series victory since winning 2-1 in
 South Africa  16 years ago.  Lions head coach Warren Gatland is scheduled to announce
his starting lineup in two days. Irish center  Brian O’Driscoll ,
playing in his fourth Lions tour, took over as captain when
Warburton left the field injured in Melbourne.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
