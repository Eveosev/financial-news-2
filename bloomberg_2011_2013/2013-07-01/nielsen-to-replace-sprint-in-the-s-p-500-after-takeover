Nielsen Holdings NV (NLSN)  will replace
 Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  in the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index after the
end of trading on July 8, S&P said in a statement today.  Shareholders of Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint last
week approved a $21.6 billion deal with Tokyo-based SoftBank
Corp., agreeing to give the Japanese company control of the
third-largest U.S. wireless carrier after an eighth-month saga.
The transaction will mean that Sprint shares available for
trading will fall below the 50 percent mark set by S&P as a
criteria for membership of the U.S. equity benchmark index, the
release said.  New York-based Nielsen Holdings is the biggest provider of
U.S. television ratings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
