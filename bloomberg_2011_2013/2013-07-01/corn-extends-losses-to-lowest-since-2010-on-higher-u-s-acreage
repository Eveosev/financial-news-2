Corn futures dropped for an eighth
session, touching the lowest price since October 2010, as mild
weather improved prospects for a record crop in the U.S., the
world’s largest exporter. Wheat and soybeans also fell.  Farmers seeded 97.4 million acres (39.4 million hectares)
of corn, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said June 28. That
is the most since 1936 and exceeded the 95.431 million that
analysts expected in a Bloomberg survey. Temperatures in the
Midwest, the biggest growing area, will be lower than normal
over the next five days, minimizing the risk of yield losses
from excessive heat, according to DTN.  “There’s no heat in the extended forecast, so the weather
is no real threat to anybody,”  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst
at Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a
telephone interview. “The fact that we have 97 million acres of
corn was a shock to everybody.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 0.7 percent to
$5.0725 a bushel at 9:59 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after touching $5.0375, the lowest for a most-active contract
since Oct. 8, 2010. Prices have slumped 11 percent over eight
sessions, the longest losing streak since February.  The USDA on June 12 forecast a record harvest this year of
14.005 billion bushels, up 30 percent from last year’s drought-damaged crop.  Wheat futures for September delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$6.5525 a bushel in  Chicago , heading for an eighth straight
decline, the longest since June 2005. U.S. exporters shipped
1.48 million metric tons from June 1 through June 20, down 15
percent from the same period a year earlier, USDA data show.  “We’re not sparking interest” from overseas buyers,
Schultz said. “There’s no export business being done.”  Soybean futures for November delivery slid 0.5 percent to
$12.46 a bushel on the CBOT, after touching $12.38, the lowest
for a most-active contract since February 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
