The benchmark spread between light
and heavy crudes on the  Gulf Coast  widened to the highest level
in nearly three months as  Mexico ’s national oil company reduced
prices to maintain U.S. market share.  The premium of Light Louisiana Sweet to Mexican Maya, the
benchmark light and heavy crudes for Gulf Coast refiners, grew
by $1.94 to a $9.68-a-barrel  premium  at 2:13 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the largest
differential since March 25.  Petroleos Mexicanos , Mexico’s national oil company, better
known as Pemex, reduced the K factor it uses to adjust the price
of Maya by $1.90 to minus-65 cents a barrel for July.  “They have to compete with Saudi Basrah as well as
increasing amounts of light, sweet crudes that are showing up on
the Gulf Coast,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston. “If the spread remains narrow,
people will want to reduce their contract volumes.”  U.S. oil imports from Mexico rebounded to 973,000 barrels a
day in April from 608,000 barrels a day in March, which was the
lowest level since April 1990, according to U.S. Energy
Information Administration  data .  The LLS-Maya gap averaged $8.01 a barrel in June. It was
$6.14 a barrel in May, the lowest monthly average since January
2012.  Gulf Crudes  Gulf crudes weakened versus the U.S. benchmark as the
Brent-WTI spread shrank to less than $5 for the first time since
Jan. 18, 2011. Gulf oils compete with foreign crudes priced
against Brent for space in U.S. refineries.  The  premium  of LLS to West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , weakened 5 cents to $7.20 a barrel as of 2:13 p.m. in
New York. That’s down from a year-to-date high of $23 on March
20. Heavy Louisiana Sweet slid 15 cents to a $7 premium.  The Mars Blend premium to WTI narrowed 10 cents to $1.55 a
barrel. Poseidon narrowed 30 cents to 80 cents a barrel more
than the U.S. benchmark. Southern Green’s premium shrank 10
cents to 75 cents, and  Thunder Horse  was unchanged at $4.75 a
barrel more than the U.S. benchmark.  No trades were recorded on Calgary-based oil broker Net
