Hog futures, little changed in
Chicago, may rise on speculation that an outbreak of a pig
disease will curb U.S. pork production. Cattle increased.  The disease called porcine epidemic diarrhea virus has
spread to at least 13 states, and a June 19 report showed the
most confirmed cases were in  Iowa , the biggest U.S. hog
producer. The virus can kill  young pigs , according to the
American Association of Swine Veterinarians. As of June 1, the
number of the animals under 50 pounds (22.7 kilograms) was 1
percent lower from a year earlier, the U.S Department of
Agriculture said after the close of trading June 28.  The disease is creating concern that “perhaps this is a
bigger deal than anyone is giving it credit for,” Ryan Turner,
a risk-management consultant at FCStone Group Inc., said in a
telephone interview from Kansas City, Missouri. “Maybe we’ll
have less production in the fourth quarter than people are
thinking.”  Hog futures for August settlement rose 0.1 percent to 97.55
cents a pound at 11:08 a.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.
Prices climbed 7 percent last quarter and were up 14 percent
this year through June 28, the biggest gain among the 24
commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  Wholesale  pork  climbed 1.8 percent last week, the fourth
straight gain, and reached $1.1133 a pound on June 26, the
highest since at least October 1997, USDA data show.  Cattle futures for August delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$1.22625 a pound on the CME.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement climbed 0.9
percent to $1.50825 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
