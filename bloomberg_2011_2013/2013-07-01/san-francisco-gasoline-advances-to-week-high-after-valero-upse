Spot gasoline in San Francisco
strengthened for a third day to the highest level in a week as
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Northern  California  refinery worked to
increase rates at a unit following an upset over the weekend.  Valero’s 170,000-barrel-a-day Benicia refinery was
returning the fluid catalytic cracker to planned rates after a
“brief outage” June 29,  Bill Day , a spokesman at the company’s
headquarters in San Antonio, said by e-mail today.  “No material impact to production is expected,” he said.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco
jumped 6 cents to a premium of 13 cents a gallon against futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest since
June 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg at 4:27 p.m.
Prompt-delivery rose a third day, up 8.23 cents to $2.8679 a
gallon.  The same fuel in  Los Angeles  climbed 1 cent versus futures
to a premium of 10 cents a gallon.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance refinery
in Southern California plans to flare gases from tomorrow
through July 4, a notice to the South Coast Air Quality
Management District shows. The flaring isn’t related to a
breakdown, according to the filing.  Carbob in  San Francisco   gained  5 cents against the fuel in
Los Angeles to a premium of 3 cents a gallon, its highest level
since May 30.  Retail gasoline  in California slipped 0.6 cent to $3.998 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the nation’s largest
motoring organization, said today on its website. Prices are up
from $3.755 a year ago.  The premium for spot, conventional gasoline in  Portland ,
 Oregon , rose 0.25 cent to 13 cents a gallon versus futures.
Portland gasoline weakened 0.75 cent against Los Angeles Carbob
to a premium of 3 cents a gallon.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and California-grade diesel in Los Angeles
widened for the first time in eight days, gaining 10 cents to
$13.34 a barrel at 4:18 p.m.  New York  time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
