Serbia is seeking a deal with the
World Bank for cheap budget financing rather than the
International Monetary Fund, state news agency Tanjug cited
Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  as saying.  Serbia will “try to have a program with the World Bank
without an IMF program,” Dinkic was quoted as saying. Talks
with the World Bank on a program to support structural reforms
should be held over the coming weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
