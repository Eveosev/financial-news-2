Question: Hi Wendy, I read with interest  your review of the three river cruises you took last year . My wife and I are considering a river cruise but are concerned about the lack of space on the boat. Would you pay extra for a balcony? And, regarding river cruises in general, which offered the best scenery? Which would you take again? Thanks from Houston, Texas, Answer: If you can believe it, Alejandro, I actually took  four  European river cruises last year. Most scenic overall was the trip down the Seine on the  M/S Bizet . You'll get a good feel for the landscape if you  click here to see my photos from that cruise , and you can compare that scenery with what you see in  this slide show from my trip down the Rhine  and  this one from my Danube cruise . You can get a further sense of the degree to which the scenery you'll see depends on the weather via  these pics from my fourth river cruise  last year. You asked which one I'd take again, and my answer is definitely the Seine—partly because of the river's picturesque charm, its surprising twists and turns, and its more intimate scale, and partly because I really liked the guides and my fellow passengers on that sail. But you also say you're concerned about lack of space onboard, and the Seine cruise was on the smallest boat (the  Bizet  has only 120 passengers). The river ship that felt largest and least cramped to me—with the most public spaces that were never crowded and, in fact, were often empty—was the 160-passenger  S.S. Antoinette  on the Rhine. If you really want space, you might consider one of the suites on the new  Viking River Cruises longships , which carry 190 passengers each. I haven't tried them myself, but my colleague Deborah Dunn has, and she reports that " the veranda suites are definitely roomier than the veranda cabins, have bigger, nicer bathrooms, and have an extra sitting area ." You also asked whether I personally would pay extra for a balcony. I'd definitely pay extra to have one on the  Bizet , not just for the space but for the window you can open—which means a river breeze and better photos. On the other river ships I sailed on, though, I'm not sure the extra expense of a balcony was worth it. On ocean cruises I spend a ton of time on my balcony, but on river cruises I rarely use it: I prefer to be up on the open-air top deck, where I can see the scenery on both sides of the river at once, rather than in my cabin where I can see only one.
