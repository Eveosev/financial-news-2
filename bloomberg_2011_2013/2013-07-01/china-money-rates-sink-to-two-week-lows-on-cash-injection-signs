China’s benchmark money-market rates
dropped to two-week lows on signs policy makers used targeted
cash injections to ease the worst cash squeeze on record.  About 50 transactions for overnight funds in the  interbank
market  were recorded in the final 90 minutes of trading in
 Shanghai  over the past four trading days at rates of 4 percent
or less,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show. The average was 5.08
percent. The central bank said June 25 that it had provided
funding to some financial institutions to stabilize interbank
lending rates and would use short-term liquidity operations to
ensure steady markets.  The one-day repurchase  rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, fell 54 basis points, or 0.54 percentage
point, to 4.42 percent as of 4:30 p.m. in Shanghai, the lowest
since June 17, according to a weighted average compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center. The seven-day repo  rate  slid
71 basis points to 5.45 percent, earlier touching 5.40 percent,
the lowest since June 17. The rates reached record highs of
13.91 percent and 12.45 percent on June 20.  “The market is expecting the cash crunch will ease,” said
Liu Junyu, a bond analyst in Shenzhen at  China  Merchants Bank
Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest lender. “The PBOC’s remarks
have given the market some confidence.”  The People’s Bank of China signaled on June 25 that
liquidity support during the cash squeeze would be focused on
banks that lend to help the economy. The central bank today
gauged demand for sales of seven- and 14-day reverse-repurchase
contracts this week, according to a trader at a primary dealer
required to bid at the auctions. It also assessed demand for 28-day repo contracts and 91-day bills, according to the trader.  Bank Reserves  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, held at 3.97 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Daily  fixings  for the
seven-day repo averaged 6.81 percent in June, the highest in
data going back to the start of 2004.  China’s banking regulator said the operations of its
lenders won’t be disrupted because they’ve built up sufficient
cash reserves. The holdings totaled about 1.5 trillion  yuan 
($244.4 billion) as of June 28, more than double what is usually
required, Shang Fulin, chairman of the China Banking Regulatory
Commission, said June 29 in Shanghai.  The yield on the 3.38 percent government bond due May 2023
was unchanged at 3.55 percent, according to the Interbank
Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
