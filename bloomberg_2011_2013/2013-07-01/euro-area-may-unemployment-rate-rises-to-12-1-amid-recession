The euro-area jobless rate increased
in May as the currency bloc struggled to emerge from a record-long recession, increasing pressure on its leaders and the
European Central Bank to spur economic growth.  The euro-area unemployment rate rose to 12.2 percent from a
revised 12.1 percent in April, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said today. The  median  of 36 economists’
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for an increase to 12.3
percent.  The number of jobless people in the euro area rose to 19.3
million in May, up 67,000 from the previous month. Youth
unemployment was at 23.9 percent. The jobless rate in  Germany ,
Europe’s largest economy, fell to 5.3 percent, while Spain had
the highest May rate at 26.9 percent.  The 17-nation economy’s  18-month recession  probably ended
in the second quarter, as the economy stagnated before returning
to growth in the following three months, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
