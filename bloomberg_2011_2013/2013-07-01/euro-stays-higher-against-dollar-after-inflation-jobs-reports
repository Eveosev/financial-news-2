The euro stayed higher against the
dollar and the yen after reports showed inflation in the euro
area accelerated while unemployment rose.  Europe ’s common currency advanced 0.3 percent to $1.3042 at
10:07 a.m. London time, and gained 0.7 percent to 129.88 yen.  The annual inflation rate in the euro area rose to 1.6
percent last month from 1.4 percent in May, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said in a preliminary estimate
today. That’s in line with the median of 40 economists’
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
