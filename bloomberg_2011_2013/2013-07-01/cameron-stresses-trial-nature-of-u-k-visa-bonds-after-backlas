Prime Minister David Cameron stressed
that a U.K. proposal to levy bonds on “high-risk” migrants is
only at the trial stage after a backlash from countries
including  India .  Plans to make some migrants pay 3,000 pounds ($4,600)
before entering the U.K., announced by Home Secretary Theresa May last month, provoked an angry reaction in the countries that
would be affected. The proposal is designed to stop short-term
visitors from India,  Pakistan ,  Bangladesh , Nigeria,  Ghana  and
Sri Lanka from overstaying in Britain.  While the Tory-led coalition government wants to get net
migration to below 100,000, it is also seeking to boost trade
ties with economies such as India, set to overtake China as the
most populous nation, as key export markets in the euro region
remain mired in recession.  “The bonds will be a pilot scheme,” Cameron said at a
news conference today in Astana, Kazakhstan, alongside President
Nursultan Nazarbayev. “We want genuine students and visitors.
We don’t want to have people who are effectively economic
migrants. That was what we saw under the last government when
immigration got out of control.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
