Ericsson AB (ERICB) , the largest maker of
wireless networks, agreed to buy U.K. media services company Red
Bee Media Ltd. from a group led by Macquarie Advanced Investment
Partners LP to expand in services to broadcasters.  The acquisition of Red Bee Media, with its 1,500 employees,
will help Ericsson take advantage of increased video consumption
via web-surfing devices, the Stockholm-based manufacturer said
today in a statement, without disclosing the purchase price.  Red Bee Media’s customers include British Broadcasting
Corp., phone company  BT Group Plc (BT/A) , pay-television provider
 British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY)  and the MTV unit of  Viacom
Inc. (VIAB)  Ericsson acquired Technicolor SA’s broadcast-services
division last year to bolster its own unit started in 2007.  “We can create value for broadcasters by making digital
content more accessible, enabling monetization of TV content
more efficiently,” Magnus Mandersson, the Ericsson executive
vice president who runs its global services business, said in
the statement. “Video traffic shows very strong uptake in the
mobile networks, and Ericsson can address the need of both
broadcasters and telecom operators through our technology
expertise and services capabilities.”  Ericsson rose as much as 0.8 percent to 76.55 kronor and
was trading up 0.3 percent at 9:47 a.m. in Stockholm. The stock
has gained 17 percent this year, valuing the company at 251
billion kronor ($37.7 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
