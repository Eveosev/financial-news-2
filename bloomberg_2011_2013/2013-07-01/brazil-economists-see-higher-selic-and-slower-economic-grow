Brazil  economists raised their
benchmark interest rate forecast and cut economic growth
expectations for this year and next, as inflation persists above
the central bank’s target.  Brazil’s central bank will raise the Selic to 9.25 percent
this year and hold it at that level through 2014, up from the
previous week’s forecast of 9 percent for this year and next,
according to a June 28 central bank survey of about 100 analysts
published today. The economy will expand 2.4 percent this year
and 3 percent next year, compared with the previous forecast of
2.46 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration is working to
reverse a deteriorating economic outlook in the world’s second
largest emerging market. Brazil’s central bank last week cut its
forecast for gross domestic product expansion this year, as
quickening inflation drags down family and business sentiment.
Economic and social discontent has prompted the biggest street
protests in decades, as more than a million demonstrators have
taken to the streets in the past month to oppose inflation,
corruption and poor public services.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 were
unchanged at 9.87 percent at 9:05 local time. The real
strengthened by 0.2 percent to 2.2271 per  U.S. dollar .  Central bankers, in their quarterly inflation report
released on June 27, said inflation will reach 6 percent this
year should the benchmark rate remain unchanged at 8 percent, up
from a March forecast of 5.7 percent. They also cut the 2013
growth prediction to 2.7 percent, from 3.1 percent.  Inflation Target  Consumer prices rose 6.67 in mid-June from last year,
compared with 6.46 percent in mid-May. Inflation prompted
central bankers to accelerate the pace of benchmark rate
increases on May 29, by raising the Selic by 50 basis points to
8 percent. Policy makers target inflation at 4.5 percent plus or
minus two percentage points.  Economists increased their 2013 inflation forecast to 5.87
percent from 5.86 percent a week ago, the central bank survey
said. Consumer price increases will reach 5.88 percent next
year, up from the previous week’s forecast of 5.8 percent.  First-quarter  growth  decelerated to 0.55 percent during the
first quarter, as a drop in family consumption offset a rise in
investments. Brazil’s economy expanded by 0.9 percent last year,
the slowest pace since the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers
collapse in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
