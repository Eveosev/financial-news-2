Solar Frontier K.K., a unit of
 Japan â€™s  Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. (5002) , restarted production at a plant
in southwestern Japan amid growing demand for solar panels.  The MP2 plant in Miyazaki prefecture, which had been
suspended since the end of 2012, will restart making
conventional thin-film modules for residential use, the company
said in a statement today.  The company also plans to start producing a new type of
panel at the plant before the end of the year, it said, without
giving details of the new product.  Solar Frontier, whose main production plant in Miyazaki has
capacity of 900 megawatts, makes panels using copper, indium,
gallium and selenium, known as CIGS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
