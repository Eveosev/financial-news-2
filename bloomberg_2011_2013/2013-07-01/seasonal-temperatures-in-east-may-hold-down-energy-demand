Seasonal temperatures will prevail in
the eastern U.S. by mid-July, staving off any spikes in energy
demand in large population areas, said  Matt Rogers , president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Rogers predicts that the U.S. east of the Mississippi
River, as well as the Southwest, will have mostly normal weather
July 11 to 15. New England and eastern Canada may be 3 to 5
degrees Fahrenheit (1.6 to 2.8 Celsius) warmer than normal, said
Rogers, who’s based in Bethesda, Maryland.  The forecast “is fairly benign demand-wise, but we also
see some marginally hotter weather in the Plains, western
Midwest, and north Texas toward the end of the period,” Rogers
said in a note to clients.  Above-average warmth in the big cities of the East and
Midwest can spur natural gas demand as more people turn to air
conditioners to keep cool.  Power plants  will account for 32
percent of U.S. gas consumption this year, Energy Information
Administration data show.  The normal average reading for July 10 in  New York City  is
about 77 degrees, according to  MDA Weather Services  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Boston, it’s 73; Chicago, 74;
Houston, 84;  St. Louis , 80; and in Burbank, California, 74.  To contact the reporter on this story:
