Mexico’s peso rose for a seventh day
as a rebound in U.S. manufacturing boosted the outlook for the
country’s biggest trading partner, outweighing a poll showing
economists lowered their local growth forecasts for this year.  The currency climbed 0.1 percent to 12.9223 per U.S. dollar
at 9:49 a.m. in Mexico City. Today’s increase cut its loss this
year to 0.5 percent. Yields on government bonds maturing in 2024
fell 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 5.70 percent.  “The data that has to do with manufacturing is what we
have been waiting for in Mexico,”  Mario Copca , a currency and
fixed-income strategist at Metanalisis SA, said in a telephone
interview from Mexico City. “It has a direct impact on the
exchange rate.”  Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the U.S.  The Institute for Supply Management’s U.S. manufacturing
index climbed to a three-month high of 50.9 last month from 49
in May, according to a report released today. The median
forecast of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for the
measure to rise to 50.5. A reading of 50 is the dividing line
between expansion and contraction.  In Mexico, economists polled by the central bank expect the
Latin American country’s gross domestic product to grow 2.84
percent this year, from 2.96 percent last month, according to a
monthly survey released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
