Jill E. Sommers, the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission member who oversaw the agency’s
investigation into the collapse of MF Global Holdings Ltd., will
step down from the agency next week.  Sommers, one of two Republicans on the five-member panel,
has served as a commissioner since 2007, spanning a period when
the agency won new authority to regulate the swaps market and
implement rules required under the Dodd-Frank Act. She will
leave the agency on July 8, she said today.  “It’s been a unique time at the commission, and I feel
it’s been a great opportunity for me to be here,” Sommers, 44,
said in a telephone interview. “I’m proud of what the agency
has accomplished and hope to stay active in the industry.”  The CFTC sued Jon S. Corzine last week for failing to
adequately supervise employees while he was chairman and chief
executive officer of MF Global. The New York-based broker
collapsed in October 2011, leaving a $1.6-billion client fund
shortfall that has now mostly been recouped.  Sommers took over overseeing the investigation in 2011
after CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler decided not to participate
because he had worked with Corzine at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  J. Christopher Giancarlo, executive vice president at
interdealer broker  GFI Group Inc. (GFIG) , is the top candidate for a
Republican appointment to the CFTC this year, according to three
people briefed on the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
