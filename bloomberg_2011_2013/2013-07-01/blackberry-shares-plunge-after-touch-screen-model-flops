Even die-hard  BlackBerry (BBRY)  fans are
beginning to waver after the Canadian smartphone maker disclosed
disappointing demand for a touch-screen device viewed as
critical to attracting younger users.  BlackBerry shares plunged 28 percent on June 28, the
biggest decline since 2000, after the company reported profit
and phone shipments that missed analysts’ estimates and revenue
hurt in part by  Venezuela ’s currency controls. The culprit: a
shortfall in sales of the flagship Z10 handset, a new model
designed to go head-to-head against  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and
devices using  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android.  The stumble risks undermining BlackBerry’s credibility with
remaining supporters among consumers, analysts and corporate
customers. Maynard Um of  Wells Fargo Securities LLC , one of nine
analysts left who had considered BlackBerry a buy, cut his
rating to hold. The slump also raises the possibility more
developers may avoid the platform, following the path of app-maker Ideomed Inc., whose marketing chief describes BlackBerry
as sliding toward MySpace-style irrelevance.  “This is about as bad as it gets,”  Brian Blair , an
analyst at Wedge Partners LLC in  New York , said in an interview
with Emily Chang on “Bloomberg West.” “We got a really good
look at the Z10 demand and it’s a dud by any metric.”  BlackBerry is faltering in its bid to expand beyond phones
that feature a physical keyboard, still popular among business
customers -- though not as sought-after as the iPhone or devices
running Android.  Subscriber Decline  BlackBerry’s worldwide subscriber base slipped to 72
million last quarter, from 76 million and 79 million in the
preceding quarters, and the company last week said it will no
longer even disclose a user tally.  “Turnarounds in technology are tough,”  said Kevin Stadtler, president of  Fort Worth , Texas-based Stadtler Capital
Management, which owns about 45,000 BlackBerry shares, down from
80,000 earlier this year. “The Z10 has not caught fire.”  The Z10 is central to BlackBerry’s attempt to branch out
beyond phones boasting a physical qwerty keyboard. The Waterloo,
Ontario-based company last quarter shipped 2.7 million
BlackBerry 10 devices, primarily its flagship Z10, about 25
percent fewer than analysts were expecting.  “The question is can they stay relevant and remain one of
the choices that is on the table,” said  Charles Golvin , an
analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge,  Massachusetts .
“So far the answer is unclear.”  ‘Negative’ Indicators  While the new Q10 is expected to sell well with the
BlackBerry faithful who crave its physical keyboard, it may be
too little too late to appease impatient investors, said Blair,
the Wedge Partners analyst, who doesn’t rate BlackBerry shares.  “I actually think they’re likely to sell a decent amount
in this current quarter and then fade away,” Blair said. “But
it’s hard to say investors will care at that point, because
these first indicators of demand are so negative.”  BlackBerry’s  loss  last quarter was 13 cents a share,
excluding some items. Even taking into account revenue losses in
 Latin America  that the company blamed on Venezuela’s currency
controls, it still missed analysts’ average estimate. Sales of
$3.07 billion also fell short of the $3.37 billion predicted by
analysts.  The sluggish sales growth heightens the risk of a spiral
for BlackBerry in which software developers are more reluctant
to build games and other apps for BlackBerry 10, which in turn
turns off consumers, said Forrester’s Golvin.  Reluctant Developer  “As sales look less promising, it’s more difficult for
BlackBerry to convince developers to create unique and
customized apps for the BlackBerry platform,” he said. “That
is definitely a big risk for the company.”  Case in point:  Ideomed , a  Grand Rapids , Michigan-based
developer of disease-management apps.  “We specifically chose not to develop for BlackBerry
because of the challenges that they were having,” said Brian
Mack, Ideomed’s director of marketing. He compared BlackBerry to
MySpace, the one-time high-flying social network that was
relegated to irrelevance by  Facebook Inc. (FB)   Instead, what BlackBerry may do is focus on its core base
of business-app developers, who will stick to the platform
because it’s more lucrative per app than Android or Apple’s iOS,
said Morgan Reed, executive director of the Washington-based
Association for Competitive Technology.  Early Stages  BlackBerry’s Z10 was introduced in the U.K. in late January
before being rolled out in the following weeks in  Europe  and the
U.S. The Q10, which has a physical keyboard, was introduced in
April in some markets, though not in the U.S. until June.  BlackBerry Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins, speaking
on a June 28 conference call, asked for patience.  “BlackBerry 10 is still in the early stages of its
transition,” he said. “In fact, we are only five months in to
what is the launch of an entirely new mobile computing
platform.”  Last year, Heins began a review of BlackBerry’s strategic
options. In the past, he hasn’t ruled out an acquisition of
BlackBerry, while stressing that he’s more focused on striking a
licensing deal or forging some other partnership. On the June 28
call, he did not give an update on the review in his prepared
remarks.  Asked by an analyst about the review, Heins said he
wouldn’t publicly discuss any board-level conversations the
company may or may not be having.  Takeover Speculation  Speculation about a possible takeover continues. The stock
jumped in January after  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)  Chief Financial
Officer Wong Wai Ming told Bloomberg that the Chinese company
was “looking at all opportunities,” including BlackBerry.  Anil Doradla, an analyst at William Blair & Co in  Chicago .,
sees a bid for BlackBerry as unlikely given the questions
surrounding BlackBerry 10 and the fact the company could have
been bought more cheaply last year.  “Remember this was an $8 stock not too long ago, and no
one bought it then.” he said. “If it was going to be bought
off, it would’ve been bought off a year ago.”  BlackBerry closed at $10.46 on June 28, more than erasing
this year’s gain of 22 percent through the prior day. Macquarie
Securities USA Inc. lowered its rating on the stock from hold
after the earnings report, pushing the number of sell
 recommendations  to 23 out of 43 total.  Even Microsoft Corp., which has made little headway gaining
share against Apple in smartphones, is outpacing BlackBerry. In
the global smartphone market, BlackBerry’s share shrank to 2.9
percent last quarter from 6.4 percent a year earlier, according
to research firm IDC. Apple and Android together held 92 percent
of the market. Microsoft’s Windows Phone bumped BlackBerry into
fourth place.  Loyal Fans  BlackBerry still has legions of fans, including executives
who prefer its corporate security over smartphone systems geared
for consumers.  John Sculley , who was the CEO at Apple from 1983 to 1993,
has been a BlackBerry addict for years because he types “pages
and pages” of messages and prefers the physical keyboard. He
has a Q10 and considers its new operating system well-designed,
even though he often prefers to take comfort in using his old
BlackBerry.  While he’s optimistic about BlackBerry’s prospects, Sculley
said the company needs to make a dramatic change in strategy.
BlackBerry could position itself as a premium brand like BMW, he
said.  “The clock is running on them,” said Sculley, who now
invests in health-care technology and other startups. “They can
come back if they drop hardware and focus on secure messaging.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
