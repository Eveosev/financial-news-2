Ibovespa  futures  fell, a sign the
equity index may decline for a second session, after a survey
showed economists covering  Brazil  cut their economic growth
forecasts for a seventh consecutive week.  Gerdau SA, Latin America’s largest steelmaker, may move
after Bank of America Corp. boosted its recommendation to buy.
Homebuilder Rossi Residencial SA may be active after it was
raised to the equivalent of hold at Morgan Stanley.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in August sank 0.5
percent to 46,880 at 9:33 a.m. in Sao Paulo, erasing an earlier
advance of 0.8 percent. The real strengthened 0.1 percent to
2.2285 per dollar. Economists covering Brazil lowered their
estimate for 2013 growth to 2.40 percent from 2.46 percent,
according to a central bank survey released today.  “The main concern right now with the Brazilian economy is
the risk of further deceleration,” equity analyst Carlos Firetti and economist Dalton Gardimam at Banco Bradesco SA’s
brokerage unit wrote in a note to clients.  The Ibovespa slumped into a bear market on June 11 after
falling more than 20 percent from this year’s peak on Jan. 3. It
has since extended those losses to 25 percent. Brazil’s
benchmark equity gauge trades at 12.1 times analysts’  earnings
estimates  for the next four quarters, compared with 10.3 for the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 8.97 billion
reais on June 28, compared with a daily average of 7.93 billion
reais this year through June 25, according to data  compiled  by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
