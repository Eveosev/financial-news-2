Gunvor Group failed to buy  North Sea 
Forties at a four-month high while OAO Lukoil sought without
success to buy Russian Urals crude in the Mediterranean at the
highest differential to Dated Brent in 16 months.  Production at the Nexen Inc.-operated Buzzard field is said
to be running at reduced rates of 150,000 to 170,000 barrels a
day, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who
asked not to be identified because the information is
confidential.  Asian refiners will reduce imports of West African crude
for loading in July to the lowest in one year because of
weakening demand, cheaper alternatives and supply disruptions in
some Nigerian grades.  North Sea  Gunvor failed to buy Forties for July 24 to July 28 at 30
cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed.
This is the highest since Feb. 25, and compares with a bid at a
premium of 10 cents on June 28.  Three bids were placed at the same premium of 15 cents
without attracting any sellers. One was from Trafigura Beheer BV
for July 24 to July 28, one from  Phillips 66 (PSX)  for July 19 to July
23, and the third from  Total SA (FP)  for July 16 to July 22.  Total was also unable to buy Ekofisk for July 17 to July 24
at 80 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, 5 cents higher than
June 28, while Morgan Stanley didn’t manage to sell the grade
for July 19 to July 21 at a premium of $1.00, according to the
survey.  BP Plc (BP/)  failed to sell Brent for July 24 to July 26 at 35
cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days was 11 cents more than Dated Brent, compared with
a premium of 5 cents on June 28, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Brent for August settlement traded at $103.07 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $102.53 in the previous session. The September
contract was at $102.56 at the same time today, a discount of 51
cents to August.  Production at the North Sea Buzzard field has been lower
than normal since June 28, the people said. The reduction is due
to valves being changed at some of the field’s wells, one of
them said.  A Nexen official, Karen Fordyce in Aberdeen,  Scotland ,
wasn’t immediately available for comment by phone and an e-mail
today.  Forties lot F0704 was deferred by one day to load on July 5
to July 7 following reduced production at Buzzard, two people
with knowledge of the matter said.  Platts set the August Oseberg crude differential at 50.56
cents a barrel, while Ekofisk crude will be 46.19 cents a barrel
for the month, the oil pricing agency said in an e-mailed note
today.  Mediterranean/Urals  Lukoil failed to buy 80,000 metric tons of Urals for July
13 to July 17 loading at 45 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent
on a delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , the survey showed. That
is the highest bid since Feb. 9, 2012.  Urals in the Mediterranean rose by 20 cents to a premium of
5 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, the most since May 22, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed. In northwest  Europe , the  grade  was
unchanged at 25 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, the
highest since Aug. 16.  OAO Surgutneftegas sold via a tender one cargo of Urals for
July 22 to July 23 loading from Primorsk, and another for July
20 to July 21 loading from Ust-Luga to Talmay Trading, according
to two people with knowledge of matter who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential. Both cargoes
will be resold to China International United Petroleum &
Chemical Co., known as Unipec.  The Russian company sold a third cargo for July 24 to July
25 loading from Primorsk to  Itochu Corp (8001) , they said.  The three cargoes were sold at premiums of about 20 to 40
cents a barrel to Dated Brent, they said.  West Africa  Nigerian Benchmark Qua Iboe fell 1 cent to $2.17 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Asia  bought 1.53 million barrels a day of crude from
 Angola , Nigeria,  Equatorial Guinea , Republic of Congo,  Ghana ,
Gabon and  Democratic Republic  of Congo, the least since July
2012, according to a survey of six traders and an analysis of
loading plans obtained by  Bloomberg News . That compares with a
revised 1.58 million barrels a day for June.  Gabon will export three cargoes of Rabi Blend and two
shipments of Rabi Light for August, unchanged from July,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News. All
lots are of 650,000 barrels.  Nigeria will boost daily exports of 18 major crude grades
for August by 5.1% from July to 1.94 million barrel, loading
programs obtained by Bloomberg News showed. No Bonny Light crude
will be exported in August.  Nigeria’s manager-level oil-worker union called a “three-day warning strike” to press for improved welfare and better
severance allowances for members.  “All service companies to go on full-blown strike”
starting July 4 and “a systematic stoppage of loading vessels
for export at the oil terminals” will begin on July 5, Bayo
Olowoshile, general secretary of the Petroleum and Natural Gas
Senior Staff Association of  Nigeria , or Pengassan, said today in
an e-mailed statement. All onshore and offshore locations have
been placed on red alert, he said.  Pengassan also want the government to expedite passage of a
new petroleum industry law, check pipeline sabotage and
intervene in a tax dispute between the maritime regulator and
Nigeria LNG Ltd. In the past, Pengassan has often called off
strikes before they were due to start after assurances from the
government.  To contact the reporters on this story:
