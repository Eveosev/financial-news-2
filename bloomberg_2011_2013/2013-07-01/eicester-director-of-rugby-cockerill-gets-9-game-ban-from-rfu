Leicester Tigers Director of Rugby
Richard Cockerill was suspended for nine matches by a
disciplinary panel for his conduct in last season’s English
Premiership final.  Cockerill was found to have “used words that were obscene,
inappropriate and unprofessional and behavior that was
inappropriate and unprofessional” toward fourth official Stuart
Terheege during his team’s 37-17 win over the  Northampton Saints 
in the May 25 championship decider.  The former England hooker, who pleaded not guilty to the
charges at last night’s Rugby Football Union hearing in
Coventry, was banned until Nov. 3 and also ordered to pay costs
of 500 pounds ($760). He has the right of appeal, the RFU said
in a statement announcing the sanction.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
