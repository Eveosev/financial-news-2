A former senior KPMG LLP partner,
Scott  London , pleaded guilty to leaking confidential information
about the audit firm’s clients to a friend who made more than
$1 million trading on the inside information.  London, 50, admitted to one count of securities fraud at a
hearing today in federal court in Los Angeles. He faces as long
as 20 years in prison at his sentencing scheduled for Oct. 21
before U.S. District Judge George Wu.  “It’s almost an open plea,” London’s lawyer, Harland
Brown, told Wu at the hearing, indicating that there was no
agreement on what the sentence the government will recommend to
the judge.  As part of his plea agreement, London, the former head of
 KPMG ’s audit business in the Southwest U.S., admitted he leaked
information to a friend about at least 14 separate earning
announcements or acquisitions by KPMG clients before they were
made public.  The friend, Bryan Shaw, pleaded guilty on May 20 to one
count of conspiracy. Shaw paid London with bundles of cash in a
side street near his jewelry store in the Los Angeles suburb of
Encino and also gave him a $12,000 Rolex watch.  Shaw began cooperating with prosecutors in February and
secretly recorded conversations with London. Shaw, who made
about $1.3 million from the illegal trades, faces as long as
five years in prison.  The case is U.S. v. London, 13-mj-01058, U.S. District
Court, Central District of  California  (Los Angeles.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
