Traditional picnic food for the July
4 Independence Day holiday in the U.S., including hot dogs,
hamburgers and potato salad, will cost less than $6 a person,
according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.  “Although retail-food prices have increased modestly over
the past year or so, most Americans should be able to find
summer picnic foods at close to the average prices found by our
volunteer shoppers,” John Anderson, deputy chief economist at
the Washington-based federation, said in a statement. The group
didn’t provide comparable figures for previous years.  Grocery food costs will rise as much as 3.5 percent this
year, including a gain of as much as 4 percent for meat, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a June 25 report. Beef
prices in May were up 1.7 percent from a year earlier, while
poultry was up 5.6 percent, the USDA said.  The average cost of feeding 10 people a typical July 4 meal
will be $57.20, or $5.72 per person, the AFBF said, based on a
survey of retail prices collected by 60 volunteer shoppers in 22
states. The 14 items on the list were ground beef for
hamburgers, hot dogs, buns for both, cheese slices, pork spare
ribs, potato salad, baked beans, corn chips, lemonade, chocolate
milk, watermelon, ketchup and mustard.  To contact the reporter on this story:
