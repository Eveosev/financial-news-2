New Zealand Prime Minister John Key
said the resignation of Pita Sharples as co-leader of the Maori
Party has no implications for his coalition government.  “The Maori Party started this term with three seats in
parliament and they are going to end this term with three
seats,” Key said in an interview with TV3 today as Sharples
announced his resignation. The party supports Key’s government
on issues of confidence and supply.  Sharples will remain in parliament until the general
election late next year, and also plans to keep his position as
a minister outside cabinet under the terms of the agreement with
Key. He is Minister of Maori Affairs and an associate minister
for education and corrections.  Sharples said today he was stepping down as co-leader to
help unite the Maori Party, which came third in a by-election in
the Maori seat of Ikaroa-Rawhiti last weekend, held by the
opposition  Labor Party . Tariana Turia remains a co-leader and
Key said the party’s third member of parliament, Te Ururoa
Flavell, would be a good replacement for Sharples.  “If Flavell takes over as one of the co-leaders, he has
had a long period with the Maori Party,” Key said. “He’d be a
strong leader I think.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
