Saudi Printing & Packaging Co. (SPPC)  slid
the most in more than two years after the newspaper and magazine
printing company’s chief executive officer resigned.  The shares  of the Riyadh-based company tumbled 10 percent,
the most since March 2011, to 34.3 riyals, at the close in
Riyadh. The stock was the biggest decliner in percentage terms
on the benchmark Tadawul All Share Index, which rose 1 percent.
Saudi Arabia is home to the Arab world’s biggest bourse.  Saad Al Azwari resigned yesterday and is leaving as of Aug.
1 when his contract ends, the company said in a  statement  to the
Saudi stock market. Saudi Printing surged 9.8 percent yesterday,
bringing the gain for the second-quarter to 5.8 percent,
outpacing the 5.2 percent advance for the benchmark.  “The CEO’s resignation gave incentive for traders to sell
the shares, especially after” yesterday’s gain, Turki Fadaak,
head of research and consultancy at Albilad Investment Co. in
 Riyadh , said by phone. “When a company’s CEO resigns suddenly
without announcing a replacement right away, that gives negative
signals.”  Yesterday’s surge took the stock’s 14-day relative strength
index to 79, above the 70 level which signals to some analysts
that a security is overbought and poised to decline. It closed
at 51 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
