U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline rallied for
a second day, climbing from the lowest level since April 3,

Reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, gained 0.55 cent to 7.95 cents a
gallon under futures.  The differentials widened while  the 3-2-1 crack spread , a

Louisiana Sweet oil dropped 25 cents to $5.11 a barrel.  A hydrocracker returned to normal rates at Valero Energy
