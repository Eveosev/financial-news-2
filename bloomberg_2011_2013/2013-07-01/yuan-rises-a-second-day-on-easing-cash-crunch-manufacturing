The  yuan  advanced for a second day
after manufacturing expanded and a Chinese regulator said banks
have enough cash to avert any disruption to their operations.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was at 50.1 in June,
official data showed today, matching the median forecast of 33
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Readings above 50 signal
expansion. Banks had about 1.5 trillion yuan ($244.4 billion) of
cash reserves as of June 28 that could be used for payment and
settlement needs, more than double what is usually required,
Shang Fulin, chairman of the China Banking Regulatory
Commission, said in a June 29 speech in Shanghai.  “Manufacturing still does remain in expansion,” said
 Jonathan Cavenagh , a strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in
Singapore. “That’s been a bit of relief for the market.”  The yuan rose 0.08 percent to 6.1327 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The  exchange rate  reached 6.1285 earlier, the strongest level
since June 20. The yuan lost 0.05 percent last month, paring its
advance for the second quarter to 1.19 percent.  The People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s reference rate
0.03 percent weaker at 6.1805 today. The onshore spot rate is
allowed to diverge from the fixing by a maximum of 1 percent.  The  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of interbank funding
availability, fell 71 basis points to 5.45 percent, according to
a weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. It touched a record high of 12.45 percent on June 20 and
has averaged 3.62 percent in one year.  ‘Lowering Stress’  “As those interbank funding costs have come down, it’s
been lowering the stress in the Chinese banking system,”
Cavenagh said. “The market can take some comfort from the fact
that the Chinese authorities are starting to talk more about
this issue.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed
at 6.2886 per dollar in  Hong Kong , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts are at a 2.5 percent  discount  to the
onshore spot rate. The offshore yuan traded in Hong Kong was at
6.1332 compared with 6.1347 late last week.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
declined two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.79
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A reading from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit’s Purchasing
Managers Index released also today was at 48.2 for June,
compared with 49.2 for May.  President  Xi Jinping  said officials shouldn’t be judged
solely on their record in boosting gross domestic product, the
Xinhua News Agency reported on June 29. That was the latest
signal that policy makers are prepared to tolerate slower
economic expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
