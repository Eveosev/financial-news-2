Euro-area manufacturing output
contracted less than initially estimated in June, adding to
signs the currency bloc’s economy is beginning to emerge from a
record-long recession.  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area
increased to 48.8 last month from 48.3 in May, London-based
Markit Economics said today. That’s above an  initial estimate  of
48.7 on June 20. The gauge has been  below 50 , indicating
contraction, since July 2011.  Today’s PMI data followed an encouraging euro-zone economic
confidence report for June that recorded the biggest jump since
July 2010. The 17-nation economy’s  18-month recession  probably
ended in the second quarter, as the economy stagnated before
returning to growth in the following three months, according to
a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said last week
that policy makers stand ready to act to support economic growth
in the euro area. The Frankfurt-based central bank cut its
benchmark  interest rate  to a record-low 0.5 percent in May.  The ECB’s monetary policy “will stay accommodative for the
foreseeable future,” Draghi said. “We have an open mind about
all other possible instruments that we may consider proper to
adopt.”  Airbus SAS last month announced an order for 35 A350-1000
planes from  United Airlines  after the U.S. carrier converted 25
commitments for the -900 version of the aircraft to the larger
model and agreed to buy 10 additional jets.  Avions de Transport Regional, the world’s largest maker of
turboprop airliners, has already eclipsed its 2013 target for
firm orders as purchases from lessors helped swell its backlog
to a record $6.5 billion, the company said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
