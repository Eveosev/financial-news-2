Treasuries traded in the narrowest
range in almost two weeks as a measure of U.S. factory
employment dropped last month to the lowest in almost four
years, even as manufacturing rebounded.  Benchmark 10-year note yields erased an early gain after an
Institute for Supply Management report showed factory employment
dropped to 48.7, the lowest since September 2009, from 50.1.
U.S. government securities handed investors a loss of 2.5
percent in the first six months of 2013, the biggest decline
since the first half of 2009, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch data. A Labor Department report July 5 is forecast
to show the U.S. added 165,000 jobs.  “Some people looked at the employment number and said it
was a weak number,” said Tom Tucci, managing director and head
of Treasury trading in  New York  at CIBC World Markets Corp.,
referring to the ISM. “We’re marking time in front of the
payroll number on Friday. That’s really the focus for the
week.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  dropped one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 2.48 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It earlier rose six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point. The price of the 1.75
percent note due in May 2023 rose 2/32 or 63 cents per $1,000
face amount to 93 21/32.  The yield will trade around the 2.50 percent level until
July 5, Tucci said.  The Treasury 10-year yield traded in a 7.9 basis-point
 range  today, the narrowest since June 18. Even after recent
increases, it is more than a percentage point below its  decade
average  of 3.56 percent.  Volume Tumbles  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , fell 44 percent to
$249.75 billion, the least since May 7. It closed at $445
billion on June 28. The 2013 average is $322.8 billion.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index closed at 97.13 on June
27, down from 110.98 on June 24, the highest since November
2011.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month to support the economy by putting
downward pressure on borrowing costs, including $3.14 billion in
Treasuries today maturing between August 2020 and May 2023,
according to the New York Fed’s  Website .  Bernanke said on June 19 the central bank could reduce its
monthly purchases if the employment outlook shows sustained
improvement. U.S. employers added  workers  last month, a survey
showed before the Labor Department data this week, after hiring
175,000 in May.  Bond Outflows  “Friday’s data will be the apex of this week,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in New York of government-debt
trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. “The economic numbers are
still not amazingly strong.”  The ISM’s manufacturing index climbed to a three-month high
of 50.9 from 49 in May, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said
today. The median forecast of  85 economists  surveyed by
Bloomberg called for the measure to rise to 50.5. A reading of
50 is the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  Investors who poured $1.26 trillion into bond funds in the
past six years pulled out record amounts of cash last month,
leaving the world’s biggest fixed-income managers struggling to
stem the flow.  The funds saw $61.7 billion of withdrawals as money market
mutual-fund assets rose $8.17 billion in the week ended June 25,
according to TrimTabs Investment Research and the Money Fund
Report.  ‘Inflection Point’  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Global Broad Market Index
dropped 2.9 percent in the past two months, the most since the
inception of the daily gauge in 1996, as Bernanke laid out
possibilities for reducing the $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases supporting the economy.  Market bears say losses are just getting started because
yields barely exceed inflation, leaving little relative value in
bonds as the global economy improves. Pacific Investment
Management Co., BlackRock Inc. and DoubleLine Capital LP, which
together oversee about $6 trillion in assets, said the worst is
already over because the securities are  fairly valued .  “We are at a definite inflection point,” Richard Schlanger, who helps invest $20 billion in fixed-income
securities as a vice president at Pioneer Investments in  Boston ,
said in an interview on June 28. “If this thing continues in
this vein, people are going to throw in the towel and you’re
going to get this pain trade. And the markets can’t take it.
They’d rather see a gradual rise in short-term rates versus a
precipitous rise.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
