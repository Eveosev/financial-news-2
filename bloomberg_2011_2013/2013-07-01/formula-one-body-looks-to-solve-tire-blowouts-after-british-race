Formula One’s governing body will
allow teams to test tires during a young drivers training
session at the home of the British Grand Prix as it tries to
find a solution to issues that caused four blowouts yesterday.  Mercedes driver  Lewis Hamilton  was leading from pole
position, in front of his home crowd, when his left rear tire
exploded on the eighth lap at Silverstone. He battled back to
finish fourth. Ferrari’s  Felipe Massa ,  Toro Rosso ’s Jean-Eric
Vergne and McLaren’s Sergio Perez also had tire failures as
track temperatures reached about 31 degrees Celsius (88
Fahrenheit).  Teams will be allowed to use more experienced drivers in
the young driver’s test, held July 17-19, in order to help
 Pirelli & C. SpA (PC)  improve their tires, the Federation
Internationale de l’Automobile, or FIA, said today on its
website.  “Our priority is to ensure safety for all in Formula One
and we believe the incidents at Silverstone represent a genuine
safety concern for the drivers,” said FIA President Jean Todt.
“We have thus taken the decision to alter the Young Driver Test
to allow teams to use drivers they deem fit to carry out tire
development work in a bid to solve the problems we saw at the
British Grand Prix. I believe it is fitting to carry out this
work at the circuit upon which the issues were manifested.”  Formula One’s ruling body has called Pirelli into a meeting
to discuss the matter on July 3. The next race is the German
Grand Prix at the Nuerburgring on July 7. Pirelli,  Europe ’s
third-largest tire maker, is the sole tire supplier in Formula
One.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
