Wheat futures slid to a one-year low,
extending the longest slump since 2005, on signs of record
global output and reduced demand for supplies from the U.S., the
world’s biggest exporter.  Farmers from  Australia  to  Canada  will produce a combined
683.1 million metric tons in the year that starts today, up 4.3
percent from the prior 12 months and the highest ever, the
International Grains Council said today. Prices have tumbled 16
percent this year as importers shun U.S. supplies for cheaper
grain from Russia and Ukraine, and signs of a record Midwest
corn harvest in 2013 erodes demand for wheat in livestock feed.  Corn, soybean and wheat prices plunged on June 28 after the
U.S. government estimated farmers will plant more grain than
forecast and the largest oilseed crop ever. While wheat output
in the U.S. is down from last year, production will jump 38
percent in  Russia  and 27 percent in Ukraine, the IGC data show.
Cheaper grain will curb global food costs tracked by the United
Nations that already are down 9.5 percent from a record in
February 2011, according to BB&T Capital Markets.  “The U.S. market is so overvalued that once the Black Sea
supplies get into the pipeline, we’ll start to lose business,”
Mike O’Dea, a risk-management consultant at INTL FCStone in
Kansas City, said in a telephone interview. Reduced demand for
wheat by livestock producers reflects the surge in corn supply
and lower prices, he said.  Wheat futures for September delivery fell 0.4 percent to
settle at $6.55 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the eighth straight decline and the longest slump for a
most-active contract since June 8, 2005.  Corn Slides  Corn futures for December delivery, after the harvest, fell
1.9 percent to $5.0125 a bushel, after touching $5.005, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Oct. 8, 2010. Soybean
futures for November delivery declined 0.7 percent to $12.4325 a
bushel on the CBOT, the fourth straight loss.  Exports of U.S. wheat from June 1 through June 20 were down
15 percent from the same period a year earlier, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show. Commitments to buy were up 27 percent
to 8.59 million tons, according to the USDA. Inspections at U.S.
ports totaled 83 million bushels in the first 27 days of the
marketing year that began on June 1, down 3.2 percent from a
year earlier, the USDA said today.  U.S. growers will sow 56.53 million acres of wheat in the
season that started June 1, the most in four years, the USDA
said on June 28. The agency also predicted corn, the biggest
domestic crop, will be planted on 97.379 million acres, the most
since 1936 and above the 95.431 million expected in a Bloomberg
survey.  Corn Feed  Stockpiles of corn will remain low until the U.S. harvest
starts in September, and some livestock feeders may use wheat in
animal rations, O’Dea said.  Cash corn  in Kansas City, which
normally trades at a discount to wheat, cost 63 cents more per
bushel today, USDA data show.  About 20 percent of the domestic winter-wheat crop was
harvested as of June 23, USDA data show. The agency will update
the progress of domestic planting and crop conditions at 4 p.m.
in  Washington  today. While that’s behind the five-year average
of 37 percent, collection of the grain means more will be
available, pressuring prices, according to  Shawn McCambridge  at
Jefferies Bache Commodities LLC in Chicago.  “We don’t see much as far as support” for prices,
McCambridge, a senior grain analyst, said by telephone. “Once
we see the Black Sea region wheat coming out, they’ll have more
to export this year. Not an overwhelming amount, but what they
have, they’re going to push it out quickly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
