In pricey Reykjavik, where a night at  our readers' favorite hotel  will set you back at least $400—but where the parties never end in the always-sunny summer—there has long been a need for a cheap-and-stylish place to stay. So we're celebrating the arrival of the  Hlemmur Square , a hostel-hotel hybrid from Klaus Ortlieb, the guy behind New York's now-closed Cooper Square Hotel and New Orleans'  Hotel Modern , which made our Hot List last year. The 26 hostel rooms, where you can stay for upwards of $25 a night, are Scandi-chic with their stark white beds and colorful Danish-modern furniture; those with a bigger budget can choose one of 17 stylish hotel rooms that start around $300 a night. There's also a little movie theater showing Icelandic films and a soon-to-open restaurant that's sure to be great (Hotel Modern's dining is done by fabulous chef Dominique Macquet). And since the place is in the site of a former watering hole—it's where horses rehydrated in the 1900s—you can still take a carriage ride with one of the Icelandic horses waiting out front.
