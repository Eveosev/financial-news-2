Sales of commercial-mortgage bonds
will be reduced by half during the last six months of 2013 as
rising interest rates impede new lending, according to  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)   The bank reduced its forecast for the year by $10 billion
to $65 billion, analysts led by  Alan Todd  said in a June 28
report. Sales of securities linked to property loans have been
rising, with dealers arranging $40.6 billion in new transactions
this year, compared with about $41.2 billion in all of 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Wall Street firms are charging landlords higher rates on
loans to be sold off as commercial-mortgage backed securities as
signs that the  Federal Reserve  may begin tapering its stimulus
program roil credit markets. That’s making CMBS lenders less
competitive with insurers and other real estate investors that
hold loans on their books, slowing the pace of originations, the
Bank of America analysts wrote.  CMBS originators may be pushed to loosen loan terms to win
business to make up for being less competitive on rates,
according to Bank of America.  Issuance in the $550 billion commercial-mortgage bond
market is poised to falter as concern that the central bank will
pare its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases this year sends
bonds tumbling. The yields on benchmark  10-year (USGG10YR)  Treasury notes
soared to 2.6 percent on June 25, the highest since August 2011,
before declining to 2.5 percent as Fed policy makers including
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President  John Williams 
soothed markets by saying it’s too early to curtail bond
purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
