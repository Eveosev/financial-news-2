RWE AG (RWE)  slid to a 21-month low in
Frankfurt trading after  Germany ’s second-largest utility said
its outlook for 2013 was unchanged even after a court ruled in
its favour in a dispute over gas payments to OAO Gazprom.  RWE fell 5.2 percent to 23.25 euros by the close, the
lowest closing price since September 2011. More than twice as
many shares were traded compared with the three-month daily
average. RWE was also the worst-performing stock on Germany’s
benchmark index.  An arbitration hearing ruled that RWE should be reimbursed
for some payments to Gazprom for gas supplies, and also altered
the purchase price formula. RWE said in a statement today that
the “financial effects” of the award were in line with its own
expectations, without giving a figure.  “Many had hoped for an improved forecast for 2013,”
Daniel Seidenspinner, an analyst at B. Metzler Seel Sohn & Co.
KGaA, said by phone from  Frankfurt . “The supposed agreement
with Gazprom had been taken into consideration for the very
optimistic outlook.”  RWE has fought for more flexibility on long-term contracts
after losing hundreds of millions of euros as spot gas prices
tumbled and demand slowed. Larger German competitor EON SE,
Gazprom’s biggest European customer, reached an agreement with
the Russian company on gas prices last July, which added about 1
billion euros ($1.3 billion) to the utility’s half-year results.  Gazprom will pay RWE one billion euros to compensate it
over the gas contracts, Spiegel reported yesterday. RWE declined
to comment on the size of the award.  To contact the reporter on this story:
