Tanzania raised its forecast for the
country’s 2013-14 crop after revising data.  Output in the marketing season starting today through June
may climb to 45,000 metric tons of robusta and arabica beans
from a February forecast of 40,000 tons, Adolph Kumburu,
director general of the Tanzania Coffee Board, said today by e-mail.  The East African country reaped the biggest crop in 20
years in 2012-13, according to Kumburu, who didn’t provide a
figure, and exported 70,633 tons valued at $181.1 million. The
country ships mainly to the U.S.,  Japan  and  Germany , according
to the board. The 2012-13 crop was set to almost double to about
65,000 tons, he said Feb. 14.  “Crop estimates are at 45,000 metric tons, a little up
from earlier estimates due to recasting data collection,” said
Kumburu. The robusta harvest more than doubled last season to
30,000 tons, he said. Robusta trees will this year enter the
lesser-yielding half of a two-year cycle.  Auctions for this season may be begin late this month or
early August, depending on the availability of stocks, Kumburu
said. Tanzania plans to raise production to 80,000 tons by 2016
as new trees are planted and global demand increases, according
to the board. The arabica variety is grown in the northern and
southern regions and robusta beans are more prevalent in the
northwestern region known as Kagera. The country reaps its crop
from April through August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
