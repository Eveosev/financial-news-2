The Pittsburgh Pirates extended their
winning streak to nine games as Russell Martin’s pinch-hit
single in the bottom of the 14th inning gave them a 2-1 victory
against the Milwaukee Brewers.  The Pirates, who haven’t had a winning season since 1992,
improved their record to a Major League Baseball-best 51-30.  The Boston Red Sox became the first American League to win
50 games this season, beating the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4
yesterday to boost their record to 50-34. The Red Sox scored the
winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning on a fielding
error by Toronto first baseman Josh Thole.  The Baltimore Orioles sent the  New York  Yankees to a fifth
straight loss yesterday, winning 4-2 as Chris Davis hit his MLB-leading 31st home run of the season. At 47-36, the Orioles trail
the Red Sox by three games in the AL East, where the Yankees
(42-39) slipped to fourth place out of five teams.  Yasiel Puig had his first four-hit game as a major leaguer
yesterday as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Philadelphia
Phillies 6-1. A rookie outfielder from Cuba, Puig finished his
first month in the majors with 44 hits, the second-most all-time
behind Joe DiMaggio’s 48 in May 1936.  The New York Mets were routed 13-2 by the Washington
Nationals as rookie pitcher Zack Wheeler allowed five runs over
4 2/3 innings in his Citi Field debut. Adam LaRoche, Jayson Werth, Kurt Suzuki and Ian Desmond all hit homers for the
Nationals, with Desmond’s ninth-inning blast coming against Mets
catcher Anthony Recker, who was brought in to pitch with the
home team trailing 11-0.  To contact the reporter on this story:
