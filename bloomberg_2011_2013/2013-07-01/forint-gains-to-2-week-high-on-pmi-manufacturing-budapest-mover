The forint appreciated to the
strongest in almost two weeks after  Hungary ’s purchasing
managers’ index showed manufacturing expanded in June, adding to
signs the economy is recovering.  The currency strengthened 0.3 percent to 294.25 against the
euro by 11:05 a.m. in Budapest, the second day of gains and the
strongest since June 19. Yields on the government’s benchmark
10-year bonds fell 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to
6.029 percent, near a two-week low.  The PMI rose to 50.8 points in June from 47.1 points in
May, boosted primarily by a jump in new orders, MLBKT, which
compiles the data, said in a report today. A reading above 50
indicates expansion, while figures below 50 show contraction.
Hungary’s economy exited a recession in the three months ended
March 31, with gross domestic product growing 0.7 percent, the
first quarter-on-quarter expansion since 2011.  The PMI’s “improvement from the previous month is
positive,” Robert Csajbok, a Budapest-based currency trader at
ING Groep NV, said by e-mail today. “I expect it to stay above
50.”  GDP growth may reach 1 percent this year, according to
Prime Minister  Viktor Orban , whose forecast exceeds the
government’s official 0.7 percent projection and the European
Union’s 0.2 percent estimate.  The forint was the only currency among 24  emerging markets 
to post a gain in the second quarter, appreciating 3.1 percent
versus the euro in the period, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
