U.K. Education Secretary Michael Gove
said state-run schools in  England  will now be able to set their
own term dates for the first time as part of a drive for
deregulation.  “It is heads and teachers who know their parents and
pupils best, not local authorities,” the  Department for
Education  in  London  said in an e-mailed statement today. “So it
is right that all schools are free to set their own term dates
in the interests of parents and pupils.”  Gove has already allowed schools the freedom to set the
length of their school day. His educational changes have made
him one of the more controversial figures in Prime Minister
 David Cameron ’s Conservative-led coalition, having introduced
“free schools” -- run by parents and charities -- and altered
the emphasis of testing to focus on examinations rather than
coursework.  To contact the reporter on this story:
