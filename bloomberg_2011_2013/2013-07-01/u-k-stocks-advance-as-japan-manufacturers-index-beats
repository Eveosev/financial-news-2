U.K. stocks  rose, extending the
biggest weekly gain for the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  since
April, as Japanese manufacturing data boosted confidence in the
world’s third-largest economy.  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, Standard Life Plc and BAE
Systems Plc all climbed more than 2 percent in  London  trading.
InterContinental Hotels Group Plc gained 2.4 percent after
Deutsche Bank AG upgraded the hotelier to buy. Daily Mail &
General Trust Plc also advanced.  The FTSE 100 Index added 52.97 points, or 0.9 percent, to
6,268.44 at 8:57 a.m. in London, extending last week’s 1.6
percent advance. The FTSE All-Share Index climbed 0.8 percent
today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index increased 0.1 percent.  Stocks climbed as Japan’s quarterly Tanken index for large
manufacturers turned optimistic for the first time since
September 2011, rising to plus 4 in June from minus 8 in March,
according to the Bank of  Japan . A positive figure means
optimists outnumber pessimists. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey was for a plus 3 reading.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
index was 5.5 percent lower than the average of the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
