All-Star guard  Chris Paul  said he
will re-sign with the  Los Angeles Clippers  as National
Basketball Association free-agency negotiations began.  “I’M IN!!! #CLIPPERNATION,” Paul, an unrestricted free
agent, said today in a Twitter post, hours after free agents
were allowed to begin contract talks. Deals can’t be completed
until July 10.  Paul, 28, agreed on a five-year, $107 million contract
extension,  ESPN reported , citing Paul’s agent, Leon Rose. Paul
can opt out of the deal after the fourth year, which would make
him a free agent again in 2017, according to CBSSports.com.  A six-time All-Star, Paul played his last two years with
the Clippers after six seasons with the New Orleans/Oklahoma
City franchise. He averaged 16.9 points and 9.7 assists per game
last season as the Clippers went 56-26 to win their division for
the first time in franchise history, which dates back to
1970-71.  The Clippers were beaten four games to two by the  Memphis
Grizzlies  in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs.  Paul’s return became more probable last week when Los
Angeles traded a 2015 unprotected first-round draft pick to
obtain coach  Doc Rivers  from the Boston Celtics. Paul had urged
Clippers management to bring in Rivers as a successor to the
fired Vinny del Negro, Yahoo Sports reported, citing
unidentified people.  A five-time league leader in steals, Paul’s 9.8 career
assists per game ranks highest among active NBA players. He
finished fourth in voting for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award
last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
