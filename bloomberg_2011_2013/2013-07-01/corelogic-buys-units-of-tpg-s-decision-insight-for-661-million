CoreLogic Inc. (CLGX)  agreed to buy three
real estate data companies from TPG Capital’s Decision Insight
Information Group for $661 million to expand its coverage of the
property and casualty insurance industries.  CoreLogic will acquire Marshall & Swift/Boeckh, DataQuick
Information Systems and the credit and flood-services unit of
DataQuick Lender Solutions, the  Irvine , California-based company
said in a statement today. CoreLogic expects the deal to be
completed within three months.  “The acquisition of MSB and DataQuick significantly
expands our footprint in property and casualty insurance and
adds additional scale to our existing property data and
analytics business,” CoreLogic Chief Executive Officer Anand Nallathambi said in the statement. “In addition to the obvious
financial benefits and cost synergies, the combination of
CoreLogic, MSB and DataQuick should yield significant future
growth opportunities.”  Companies are acquiring real estate information firms as
the U.S. housing market recovers from a more than five-year
 slump . CoreLogic bought the Case-Shiller home-price indexes for
$6 million in April, adding a widely used measure of U.S.
property values to its real estate data.  Fidelity National
Financial Inc. (FNF) , the largest U.S. title insurer, agreed in May to
acquire its former unit,  Lender Processing Services Inc. (LPS) , in a
$2.9 billion cash-and-stock deal to expand in the business of
providing and analyzing mortgage data.  Shares Rise  CoreLogic rose 4.8 percent to $24.29 at 10:48 a.m. in New
York. It earlier gained as much as 8.3 percent, the most since
April 25.  The deal with Decision Insight is part of a strategy to
expand CoreLogic’s data and analytics business to make up more
than half of total revenue, Nallathambi said today on a
conference call with analysts.  The company was advised by Evercore Partners and Decision
Insight was advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, according
to the statement. TPG is a Fort Worth, Texas-based private-equity firm started by David Bonderman and James Coulter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
