Italy ’s unemployment rose to a record
in May amid companies’ concerns about the outlook for the
country’s recession-hit economy.  Joblessness (ITMUURS)  rose to 12.2 percent from 12 percent in April,
the Rome-based national statistics office Istat said in a
preliminary report today. The May rate was higher than the 12.1
percent median of seven estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.
Unemployment remained above 10 percent for a 16th month and
reached the highest since the data series began in the first
quarter of 1977.  The euro region’s third-biggest economy will probably
shrink 1.9 percent in 2013, Italy’s employers lobby
Confindustria said in a June 27 report. The lobby estimated that
joblessness will reach 12.4 percent at the end of this year.
Last week, Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s Cabinet passed a plan
offering tax breaks to employers creating new jobs or converting
temporary contracts into open-ended ones. The plan aims at
boosting youth employment by allowing for up to 200,000 hires,
the premier said.  The  unemployment rate  for people between the age of 15 and
24 fell to 38.5 percent in May, Istat said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
