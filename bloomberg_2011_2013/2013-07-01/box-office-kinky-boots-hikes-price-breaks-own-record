Five weeks into the 2013-14 Broadway season, ticket prices are setting records.  Tracking only the box office and the primary online and telephone outlets, Telecharge and Ticketmaster, the average ticket was $108. That’s 13 percent above the $96 at this point last year and tops the $98 for 2012-2013 as a whole.  Producers of several late-season hits have raised prices to capitalize on demand. “Kinky Boots,” which won the  Tony Award  for best musical, hoisted its top price from $299 to $349, excluding fees.  For an upcoming Saturday night at the Al Hirschfeld Theater, a pair of tickets off the aisle in the left mezzanine are on sale through Telecharge for $717.75.  Last week, “Kinky Boots” sold $1.53 million of tickets, a record for the musical, according to the Broadway League, a trade association of producers and theater owners. It had improved by nearly $25,000 from the week before.  “Matilda” sells tickets for as much as $352, although prime pairs are readily available for $523.75, according to a search of Telecharge. The acclaimed Roald Dahl adaptation sold a record $1.22 million, up just $21 over the previous week.  “Motown,” with a top ticket of $252, sold $1.4 million, up by $4,000. “Pippin” (top price $277.50) sold a record $1.1 million. “Annie (top ticket $227) sold $1.1 million.  Christopher Durang’s “Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike” (top ticket $250) sold $692,000. As expected, its producers announced that it had recouped its $2.8 million capitalization. The Tony winner for best play is scheduled to close on August 25.  The week also saw the closing of two one-woman shows. Bette Midler’s hit “I’ll Eat You Last” sold $810,000 of tickets over 7 performances. Holland Taylor’s “Ann” had its best week in three months, selling $348,000.  Muse highlights include  James S.
