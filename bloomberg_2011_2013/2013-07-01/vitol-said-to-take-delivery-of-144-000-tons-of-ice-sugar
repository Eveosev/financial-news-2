Vitol Group, a closely held commodity
trader, is taking delivery of about 144,000 metric tons of raw
sugar after the expiry of the July contract on ICE Futures U.S.,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.  ICE confirmed the amount, the smallest for the July
contract since 2006, exchange data show. Geneva-based Vitol has
2,835 futures contracts, each representing 112,000 pounds (50.8
tons), said the people, asking not to be identified because they
aren’t authorized to talk to the media. Andrea Schlaepfer, a
spokeswoman for the company in  London , declined to comment.  Sucden Americas Corp., the Miami-based unit of Sucres et
Denrees SA in Paris, said in an e-mail that it is delivering
against 984 contracts. ICE said that the total sales will come
from ports in  Argentina , El Salvador and Mexico. The most-active
futures contract fell as much as 1 percent today to the lowest
since June 21. Through June 28, the price dropped 18 percent in
the past 12 months, partly because of a  bumper crop  in Brazil,
the world’s biggest producer.  “In a mature bear trend, the contract typically becomes a
residual market for unwanted sugar,” James Cassidy, the head of
the sugar trading desk at Newedge Group in  New York , said in a
telephone interview.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery fell 0.8 percent to
16.79 cents a pound at 12:43 p.m. on ICE in New York. Earlier,
the most-active contract touched 16.75 cents. The July contract
expired on June 28 at 16.38 cents.  Bunge Delivery  Bunge Ltd. (BG) , based in  White Plains , New York, delivered 197
contracts, according to two people familiar with the
transactions, who also asked not to be named. The company
doesn’t comment on commercial contracts,  Susan Burns , a
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  Jefferies Bache LLC was the broking company making delivery
on 2,638 contracts, while BNP Paribas Prime Brokerage Inc.
delivered 197 contracts,  ICE data  showed. ABN Amro Clearing
Chicago LLC was the receiver for the full amount.  A year earlier, the ICE delivery was 21,737 contracts, or
more than 1 million tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
