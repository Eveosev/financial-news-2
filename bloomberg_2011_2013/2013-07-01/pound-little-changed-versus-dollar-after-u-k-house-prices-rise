U.K. government bonds fell for a
second day as reports showed Britain’s manufacturing output
expanded while mortgage approvals rose, reducing demand for the
safety of fixed-income securities.  Gilts extended losses following their worst quarter since
June 2008 when  government securities  tumbled after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank may
reduce debt purchases this year.  Mark Carney  takes the helm at
the Bank of England today and will hold his first policy meeting
on this week. The pound fell for a fourth day versus the euro.  “Today’s data show further improvement in business
confidence,” Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst at Newedge
Group in London, wrote in a note to clients. “Although new
Governor Carney will probably introduce the discussion of
possible alternative measures such as forward guidance, we rule
out that the Monetary Policy Committee will make any further
announcement this week.”  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 2.46 percent at 1:34 p.m.  London  time
after climbing 68 basis points last quarter. The 1.75 percent
security due in September 2022 fell 0.16, or 1.60 pounds per
1,000-pound ($1,522) face amount, to 94.17.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 3.5 percent this year
through June 28, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 1.7 percent and Treasuries declined 2.8
percent, the indexes show.  Factory Index  A gauge of U.K. manufacturing rose to 52.5 last month from
51.5 in May, Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply  said, above the 50 level that divides
expansion from contraction. Lenders  granted  58,242 home loans in
May, the most since December 2009, the Bank of England said.  Carney will lead his first meeting as  Bank of England 
governor on July 3-4 and will assess whether further aid to the
economy is needed to support the recovery. Policy makers will
maintain the central bank’s bond-purchase  target  at 375 billion
pounds and the benchmark  interest rate  at 0.5 percent, according
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Overseas investors became net buyers of gilts in May after
cutting their holdings in April for the first time in 10 months,
according to a separate report today from the Bank of England.
Foreign investors bought 6.9 billion pounds of gilts more than
they sold in May, the data showed.  The pound weakened 0.1 percent to 85.64 pence per euro
after depreciating to 85.99 pence on May 30, the weakest since
April 17. The U.K. currency was little changed at $1.5217.  Sterling has strengthened 3.3 percent in the past three
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which track 10 developed-market currencies. The euro gained 5
percent and the dollar climbed 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
