Six bottles of 2002  Chateau Petrus ,
one of the two most expensive wine estates in Bordeaux, sold for
7,200 pounds ($10,970) on the Liv-ex market, a record high for
the vintage and up 11 percent from the start of this year.  The price, the equivalent of 14,400 pounds for a standard
12-bottle case, compares with the level of 13,000 pounds at
which it traded in both January this year and November 2012, and
is more than triple the 4,075 pounds for which it sold in August
2003, shortly after its release to the market.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 5 percent this
year, with an 8 percent gain in the 10 weeks to mid-March pared
by a 3 percent decline since then. While appetite has cooled for
some wines following sales of 2012 futures in the past three
months, rarer Bordeaux labels including Petrus remain in demand.  The 2002 vintage is the second-cheapest Petrus from the
first 12 years of this century, level with the 2004 and ahead
only of the 2011, according to merchant prices collated by  Liv-ex  on its Cellar Watch website. The vintage was awarded a 90
rating on a 100-point scale by U.S. critic  Robert Parker , the
lowest Petrus grade in the past two decades and reflecting cold,
wet weather during the growing season.  Chateau Petrus has 28 acres (11 hectares) planted to red-grape vines, of which 95 percent are Merlot and 5 percent
Cabernet Franc.  The vineyard is situated in the Pomerol appellation on the
right bank of the Dordogne river, at an altitude of 40 meters
(131 feet), the highest point in the district, on clay with an
iron subsoil. Fermentation is in temperature-controlled concrete
tanks and the young wine matured in 100 percent new oak barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
