Hennes & Mauritz AB, (HMB)   Europe ’s second-largest clothing retailer, rose the most since January in
 Stockholm  trading after Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its
recommendation to buy in anticipation that same-store sales
growth will resume.  The  shares  advanced as much as 3.8 percent in the Swedish
capital, the steepest intraday gain since Jan. 15.  Same-store sales will probably start growing again in the
second half of this year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts
Richard Chamberlain and Aurelie Caspar wrote in a note.  New store formats such as & Other Stories and COS support
the long-term growth potential of the Stockholm-based retailer,
as do expansion into newer, fragmented apparel markets
worldwide, the analysts said. H&M’s valuation should be
underpinned by moves to catch up online, they also said.  “H&M has been investing heavily online and we expect it
now to catch up starting with its U.S. launch in August,” the
analysts said. “There should be pent-up demand in the U.S. as
H&M has reached critical mass there.”  H&M was up 3.3 percent at 227.70 kronor at 11:19 a.m. local
time, making the shares the  second-biggest gainer  in the  OMX
Stockholm 30 index. (OMX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
