Russian  equities  rebounded after the
worst quarterly slump in a year as a gauge of manufacturing rose
and metal producers rallied.  The 50-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.4 percent to 1,336.17 by
the close in Moscow, having fallen 7.5 percent last quarter, the
biggest drop since the period ended June 2012. OAO Novolipetsk
Steel increased 3.3 percent to 44.61 rubles, after slumping 12
percent last quarter. OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel jumped 1.2
percent to 7.635 rubles, while OAO Severstal added 3.3 percent
to 216.30 rubles, the most since May 28.  “Metal producers fell so much last quarter that they’re
due for a rebound,” Sergey Fundobny, head of research at Arbat
Capital, said by phone from Moscow.  Russia’s Purchasing Manager’s  Index (RTSI$)  increased to 51.7 in
June from 50.4 in May, HSBC Holdings Plc said today in an e-mailed statement, citing data compiled by London-based Markit
Economics. Improving sentiment among manufacturers may signal a
turnaround is near for  Russia ’s industrial production, which
shrank on an annual basis in May for the third time this year.
Brent oil climbed 1.2 percent to $103.37 a barrel in London.  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
climbed to a three-month high of 50.9 in June from 49 a month
earlier, a report showed today. The median forecast of 85
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for the measure to rise
to 50.5.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg. Stocks slumped last
quarter and the dollar-denominated RTS Index entered a bear
market on June 5 amid concern the U.S. Federal Reserve will
taper stimulus. The RTS added 0.1 percent to 1,276.85 today.  Commodities Advance  The Standard & Poor’s  GSCI Commodities (SPGSCI)  Index increased 1.1
percent. Most metals advanced in London as some investors bet
the slowdown in manufacturing in  China  had been factored into
prices.  China’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 50.1 in
June, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics
and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing. The reading
matched the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Crude futures added 1.6 percent to $98.12 in New York.
Russia receives about 50 percent of its budget revenue from the
oil and natural-gas industry.  The volume of shares traded on the Micex was 56 percent
below the 30-day average, while 10-day price swings dropped to
18.791, the lowest since June 6.  ‘Low Valuation’  “The Russian market’s low valuation is not enough to serve
as a trigger for buying,” Fundobny said. “Today is the first
day of the quarter in the second half of the year, so investors
are hesitant to make sharp moves.”  The nation’s economy grew 1.6 percent in the first three
months, the slowest pace since 2009. Bank Rossii held its
refinancing rate at 8.25 percent on June 10 after inflation
accelerated for a second month in May to the fastest pace in 21
months.  OAO Bashneft’s preferred shares jumped as much as 7
percent, climbing 4.9 percent to 935.90 rubles, the biggest
advancer on the Micex and the most since October 2012. Rosneft
has “never held talks” on buying Bashneft from AFK Sistema,
Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin said today.  Bashneft lost 15 percent in two days after Vedomosti
reported June 25 that Rosneft’s management had expressed
interest in the company in meetings with investment bankers and
consultants prior to Rosneft’s acquisition of TNK-BP this year.  Sistema slid 1 percent to 27.915 rubles today and 0.3
percent to $19.70 in  London .  Fed Stimulus  The Micex dropped 2 percent on June 20 following comments
by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke that the
regulator will probably taper its bond buying later in 2013 and
halt purchases around mid-2014 if the world’s largest economy
performs in line with projections.  The Russian Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in RTS futures, declined 5.2 percent, dropping for a
fifth day.  The 14-day  relative strength  index on the Micex rose to 51,
up from 31 on June 13. The RSI measures how rapidly prices have
advanced or dropped during a specified time period. Readings
below 30 indicate it may be poised to rise.  Two stocks on the Micex closed on June 28 at a  52-week low 
and one at a one-year high, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twenty-five stocks, or 50 percent, were trading above
their  50-day moving average .  The Micex trades at 5.1 times its 12-month estimated
earnings, having lost about 9.4 percent this year, compared with
a multiple of 9.8 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index, which is
down 11 percent. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the
most-traded Russian companies in the U.S. climbed 0.4 percent to
84.43 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
