SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG) ,  New York 
City’s biggest office landlord, agreed to sell a 10-story
building in midtown Manhattan to American Realty Capital New
York Recovery REIT Inc. for $220.3 million.  The 347,000-square-foot (32,200-square meter) property at
333 W. 34th St. is 100 percent occupied and leased to four
tenants including the Metropolitan Transportation Authority,
according to a statement today from American Realty Capital New
York, a nontraded real estate investment trust.  “This purchase was made below replacement cost, will
increase our portfolio asset value to almost $700 million and
reflects our continuing efforts to construct a portfolio of
premium New York City real estate,” Michael Happel, chief
investment officer of American Realty Capital New York, said in
the statement.   Demand for midtown  Manhattan  office buildings is sending
values above the highs before the financial crisis, according to
Moody’s Investors Service. Midtown office prices have more than
doubled from a low in the fourth quarter of 2009, Moody’s said
in a June 12 report.  American Realty Capital New York owned 17 properties that
were 94.2 percent leased as of March 31, according to a
regulatory filing. The company is sponsored by American Realty
Capital, a New York-based operator of nontraded REITs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
