InterContinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG) ,
the world’s largest hotel-room provider, rose the most in more
than 10 months after  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  recommended buying the
shares because they’re cheap compared with competitors.  InterContinental rose 3.7 percent, the biggest gain since
Aug. 7, to close at 1,874 pence in London.  The company’s recent underperformance relative to
competitors Accor SA and Whitbread Plc is “unjustified,”
Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to clients today. The bank raised
its recommendation to buy from hold and maintained a share-price
target of 2,250 pence.  “The rating upgrade is purely based on the valuation
anomaly that shows 25 percent upside” from the latest closing
price, Deutsche Bank analysts including  Paul Reynolds  and
Mairead Smith wrote in the note.  Intercontinental, based in Denham, England, has been
selling assets as part of a strategy to focus on managing
properties and brands such as Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and
Hotel Indigo. The hotelier in March agreed to sell its London
Park Lane Hotel to Middle Eastern investors for 301.5 million
pounds ($460 million). It’s planning to sell the New York
Barclay hotel.  InterContinental has underperformed Accor by 6 percent and
Whitbread by 27 percent over the past quarter, according to the
note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
