Petroleo Brasileiro SA,  Brazil ’s
importer of liquefied natural gas, is preparing to receive
Angola’s first spot cargo, ship-tracking data show.  The Sonangol Sambizanga, with a capacity of about 161,000
cubic meters, is off the coast of  Rio de Janeiro , according to
transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. It is
scheduled to dock July 14.  The tanker loaded the supercooled natural gas at Angola’s
LNG terminal at Soyo and departed June 16, according to a
statement from Petroleo Brasileiro. The Brazilian state oil
company known as Petrobras has a floating regasification
terminal at Guanabara Bay near Rio de Janeiro.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  is the largest shareholder of the $10 billion
plant in the West African nation, which shipped the cargo after
an 18-month delay.  Brazil doesn’t have long-term LNG supply contracts with
Angola, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras will import as many as 60 shipments this year,
up from 56 in 2012, the company said June 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
