Indian bonds due 2022 climbed for a
third day, pushing the yield to the lowest level in almost two
weeks, as a rebound in the rupee tempered concern inflation will
accelerate.  The rupee has climbed 2.5 percent from an all-time low of
60.765 per dollar reached on June 26. A weaker local currency
boosts the cost of imported goods, fueling consumer-price
increases. International investors  pulled  more than $5 billion
from local debt in June, exchange data show, as the rupee lost
4.9 percent in the biggest decline since May 2012.  “The currency’s rebound has definitely helped the
sentiment,” said N.S. Venkatesh, the Mumbai-based head of
treasury at state-run  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)  “There seems to be some
demand for bonds at the beginning of the new quarter.”  The yield on 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 slid five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.58 percent at 10:38
a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.
That’s the lowest level since June 19. The rate climbed 18 basis
points last month, the most since the securities were issued in
June 2012.  The rupee fell 8.6 percent last quarter, the most since
2011, as U.S. policy makers signaled they may rein in stimulus
measures, which have boosted dollar supply, should the  U.S.
economy  perform in line with central bank estimates.  Reserve Bank  of  India  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao kept the
repurchase  rate  steady at 7.25 percent on June 17, citing
inflation risks, even after  wholesale prices  rose the least
since 2009 in May. India’s monetary-policy stance will be
determined by the evolution of economic growth, inflation and
the balance of payments in the months ahead, the central bank
said in its statement on the same day.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis
points to 7.47 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
