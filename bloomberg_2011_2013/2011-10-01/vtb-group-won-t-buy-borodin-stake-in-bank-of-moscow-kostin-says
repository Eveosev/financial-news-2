VTB Group will not buy any Bank of
Moscow shares held by former chief executive officer Andrey
Borodin as the state-controlled lender acquires minority stakes
in the lender, VTB President  Andrei Kostin  said.  VTB is working out a plan for acquiring shares from
“simple shareholders, citizens who have small stakes they
bought with their wages,” Kostin said.  Russia ’s second-biggest
lender is spending “a minimal amount” to boost its holding, he
said, without giving details.  “We are not planning to buy shares belonging to Mr.
Borodin or his cronies,” Kostin told state television. “In our
opinion, they have a small stake, but we have no desire and will
take no actions to buy it.”  VTB increased its stake in Bank of Moscow to 80.57 percent,
it said in a statement on Sept. 29. Borodin, who headed Bank of
Moscow, Russia’s fifth-biggest lender until VTB bought the
city’s stake this year, is the subject of an international
arrest warrant by the Russian authorities in connection with a
loan investigation. Borodin, 44, has denied any wrongdoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
