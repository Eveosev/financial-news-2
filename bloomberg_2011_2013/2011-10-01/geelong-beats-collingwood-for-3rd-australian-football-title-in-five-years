Geelong beat Collingwood by 38 points
in the Australian Football League grand final to win its third
premiership in five years.  The Cats won 18.11 (119) to 12.9 (81) in front of a
crowd of 99,537 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Steve Johnson
kicked four goals to lead Geelong with Jimmy Bartel, Tom Hawkins
and Travis Varcoe adding three apiece. Bartel won the  Norm Smith
Medal  as the gameâ€™s most valuable player.  The victory gives Geelong, which also took the title in
2007 and 2009, its ninth VFL/AFL premiership a year after star
midfielder Gary Ablett and coach  Mark Thompson  left the club.  Collingwood, which topped the regular-season standings
after losing just two of its 22 games, had been seeking back-to-
back titles after beating St. Kilda last year to win its first
premiership in 20 years.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
