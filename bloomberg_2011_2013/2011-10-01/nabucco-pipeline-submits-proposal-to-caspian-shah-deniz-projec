Nabucco Gas Pipeline International
GmbH said it submitted a proposal to export gas from the Shah
Deniz II project in the  Caspian Sea .  “We’re convinced that Nabucco provides the best way of
transportation for gas exports from  Azerbaijan  and other
countries,” Managing Director Reinhard Mitschek said in an e-
mailed statement from the Vienna-based pipeline group today. The
group didn’t provide details.  BP Plc (BP/) , which operates Shah Deniz, and its partners plan to
pick by the end of the year a route to ship the gas to  Europe .
On Sept. 26, BP said it may consider a fourth possible route, in
addition to the European Union-backed Nabucco link and two
smaller projects that are vying for Shah Deniz gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
