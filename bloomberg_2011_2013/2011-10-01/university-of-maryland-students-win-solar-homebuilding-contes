Students from the  University of
Maryland  won the Solar Decathlon in Washington, D.C., a U.S.
Department of Energy-sponsored contest meant to encourage
students to build energy-efficient homes.  Maryland built a home called  WaterShed , which was based on
tapping resources and ideas from the Chesapeake Bay near the
university’s  College Park  campus. Purdue University took second
place and Victoria University from Wellington, New Zealand, was
third.  “The houses on display blend affordability, consumer
appeal, and design excellence with optimal energy production and
maximum efficiency,” Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in a
statement today announcing the results.  This is the fifth such contest to be held in Washington.
Under the rules, homes can’t be larger than 1,000 square feet
(93 square meters) and must use commercially available
appliances and solar technology. The structures were judged in
10 classifications including water-heating efficiency, market
appeal and affordability.  Students from  China  competed in the event for the first
time this year. The team from Tongji University took 15th place
out of the 19 ranked at the end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
