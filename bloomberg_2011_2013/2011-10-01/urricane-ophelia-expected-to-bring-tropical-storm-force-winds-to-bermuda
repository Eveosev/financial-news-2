Ophelia, a Category 3 storm with
maximum sustained winds of 120 miles (193 kilometers) per hour,
is moving north on a track that will take it to the east of
 Bermuda .  Ophelia is 385 miles south-southeast of Bermuda and moving
north at 17 mph. A tropical storm watch is in effect for
Bermuda, where the outer edge of the system should arrive later
today, according to the latest National Hurricane Center
advisory.  “Tropical-storm-force winds are possible on Bermuda by
this afternoon,” according to the advisory. “Large swells
created by Ophelia will cause hazardous surf conditions along
the south-facing beaches of Bermuda.”  Ophelia is one of 16 storms that have formed during this
year’s season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. The Atlantic
normally produces 11 named storms with winds of at least 39 mph,
according to the hurricane center.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
