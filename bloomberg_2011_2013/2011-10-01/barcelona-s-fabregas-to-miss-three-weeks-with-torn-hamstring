Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas
will miss three weeks with a torn right hamstring, the Spanish
and European champion said on its website.  Fabregas, 24, sustained the injury in training this morning
ahead of tomorrow’s Primera Division game at Sporting Gijon.  Fabregas has scored four goals in seven matches since
joining Barcelona from Arsenal in August. He’s expected to
return for the home league match against Sevilla the weekend of
Oct. 22, the club said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
