Plutonium was detected at six
locations in Japan’s Fukushima prefecture within a 45 kilometer
radius of Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s crippled nuclear power
plants,  Kyodo News  reported, citing the Ministry of Education,
Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.  This is the first time that the substance has been detected
outside the immediate confines of the plant, and the amount of
plutonium isn’t likely to pose a health threat, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
