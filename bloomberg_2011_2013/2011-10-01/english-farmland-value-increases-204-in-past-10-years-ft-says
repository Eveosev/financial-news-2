The value of English farmland has
grown by 204 percent in 10 years, making it one of the countryâ€™s
best-performing asset classes, the London-based  Financial Times 
said, citing research by real-estate agent Knight Frank LLP.  The increase beats a 102 percent rise in London property
prices and the 6 percent growth in the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  over the
same period, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
