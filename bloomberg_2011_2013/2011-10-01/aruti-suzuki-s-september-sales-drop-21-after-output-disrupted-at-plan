Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the maker
of almost half the cars sold in  India , said it resolved a labor
dispute that disrupted production at one of its factories.  The Indian unit of Suzuki Motor Corp. signed an agreement
with workers at the plant in Manesar near New Delhi who will
resume duties on Oct. 3, the company said in a statement today.  The carmaker’s sales fell 21 percent to 85,565 vehicles in
September from a year earlier because of the disruption at
Manesar, Maruti Suzuki said in a separate statement today.
Domestic sales declined 17 percent to 78,816 vehicles, while
exports dropped 48 percent to 6,749 units.  All workers will sign a “good-conduct bond,” according to
the statement. The bond was proposed by Maruti on Aug. 29 after
five employees were dismissed and 10 suspended for
“deliberately causing quality problems.”  The company based in  New Delhi  unveiled a new version of
its Swift model in August as competition from Honda Motor Co.,
Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG intensifies. The Indian
carmaker had 108,000 orders for the model, it said Sept. 27.  Maruti reported sales fell for the third straight month in
August after demand slowed and production was reduced.  The company expects the central bank’s decision to raise
 interest rates  to damp demand for automobiles, Ajay Seth,
Maruti’s chief financial officer, said on Sept. 16. The  Reserve
Bank  of India has raised interest rates 12 times since mid-March
2010 to rein in inflation, driving down demand for cars in a
country where about 80 percent of purchases are funded by loans.  Maruti fell 2 percent to 1,083 rupees in Mumbai yesterday.
The shares have declined 24 percent this year, compared with a
20 percent drop in the benchmark Sensitive Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
