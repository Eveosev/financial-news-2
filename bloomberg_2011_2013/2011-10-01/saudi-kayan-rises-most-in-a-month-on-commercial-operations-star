Saudi Kayan Petrochemical Co. (KAYAN)  rose
the most in a month after the unit of  Saudi Basic Industries
Corp. (SABIC)  said it began commercial operations at most of its main
plants in Jubail Industrial City as of today.  The shares rallied 1.5 percent, the largest gain since
Sept. 3, to 17.25 riyals at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh after
trading up as much as 2.4 percent.  The start of commercial operations at six plants will have
a positive financial impact on the company in the fourth
quarter, the Jubail-based company said in a statement to the
Saudi bourse today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
