The U.K. government has announced
plans for a 24-hour, non-emergency telephone number for access
to the  National Health Service .  “Too many people are confused about what is available to
them or how best to get it, especially at night or if they are
away from home,” Prime Minister  David Cameron  said in an e-
mailed statement today. “The new service will make sure callers
can access the care and advice that is right for them, 24 hours
a day, 365 days a year.”  The 111 telephone line will be made available nationally by
April 2013.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
