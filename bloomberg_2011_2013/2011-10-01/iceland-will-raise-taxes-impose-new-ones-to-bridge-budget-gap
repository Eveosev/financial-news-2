Iceland’s government will reduce
public spending and introduce a new tax on financial
institutions as it seeks to bridge a 42 billion-kronur ($356
million) gap in the budget, according to the island’s  Finance
Ministry .  The government presented the budget to parliament today.
The equivalent of a value-added tax will be imposed on the north
Atlantic island’s lenders, while the government plans to raise
taxes for the use of natural resources, along with an increase
in capital gains taxes.  Iceland completed a 33-month economic program with the
 International Monetary Fund  in August, following the failure of
its three biggest lenders in October 2008. The nation received a
total of $4.6 billion from the IMF,  Denmark ,  Finland ,  Norway  and
 Sweden  to avert a default.  “Following difficult years in the state’s finances, we’re
foreseeing a considerable surplus on the preliminary balance of
payments in 2012,” the Reykjavik-based ministry said in a
statement on its website. “Furthermore, the bill doesn’t
anticipate severe actions, neither on the expense or income side
of the budget and therefore there will be no general tax
increases in the year.”  Iceland’s $12 billion economy contracted 2.8 percent from
the first quarter after growing a revised 1.9 percent in the
previous period, the Reykjavik-based statistics office said on
Sept. 8. Output expanded an annual 2.5 percent in the first six
months, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
