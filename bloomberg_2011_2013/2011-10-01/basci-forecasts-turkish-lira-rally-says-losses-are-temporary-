Turkish central bank Governor Erdem Basci said declines in the lira are “temporary” and the
currency will appreciate within a year.  “Going forward, there won’t be any additional losses that
the central bank doesn’t desire,” Basci said in Istanbul after
meeting with with members of the Turkish Industry & Business
Association. “All the preparations are in place for us to
maintain a less volatile lira as it drops or gains.”  Turkey  has monetary and rate policies in place to manage
the value of its currency, Basci said. The country and its
private sector don’t face any “serious” problems, he said.  Basci said automatic increases to natural gas and oil
prices are included in the bank’s most recent inflation
forecasts. The central bank will review whether the forecasts
need to be updated in its next inflation report. Recent
increases are “positive” in terms of  price stability , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
