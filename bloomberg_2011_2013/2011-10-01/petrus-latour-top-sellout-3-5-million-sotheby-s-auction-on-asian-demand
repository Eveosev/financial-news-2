Sotheby’s (BID)  autumn auctions began
yesterday with a wine sale in which every bottle sold, fetching
HK$27.2 million ($3.5 million) and led by 12 bottles of 1990
 Chateau Petrus  at HK$338,800.  The auction of vintages from a private American cellar was
the 16th straight sold-out wine event for Sotheby’s in Hong
Kong, showing the resilience of Chinese demand amid the
volatility of financial markets elsewhere. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index had its worst quarter since the end of 2008.  The bottles are the first of 3,400 lots of porcelain, art
and jewels that New York-based Sotheby’s forecasts will draw
more than HK$2.7 billion ($347 million) over six days, testing
the strength of  China ’s market for  luxury goods . There were
multiple bids on first-growth wines such as Chateau Margaux and
Chateau  Lafite  Rothschild in bottles of three liters and bigger.  “Large format was the major feature of today’s auction and
it shows the growing sophistication of the Asian market,” said
Robert Sleigh, head of Sotheby’s Asian wine sales. Six magnums
of Chateau Latour fetched HK$314,600.  Sotheby’s current sale has 200 fewer lots than its April
auction in the city, which took a record HK$3.49 billion,
compared with an estimate of HK$2.7 billion, the auction house
said. The star lot in the spring sale, an 18th-century Chinese
vase worth more than $23 million, failed to find a buyer.  Domaine de la Romanee-Conti burgundy wines from 1988
costing as much as $10,000 for a standard 75 centiliter bottle
will be auctioned today. Also on offer are four magnums of
Champagne direct from the cellars of Krug and Chateau Lafite
from two members of the Rothschild Family.  Ullens Museum  This evening auction will offer 90 works of Chinese
contemporary art from Guy Ullens, founder of Beijing’s largest
private art museum, estimated to raise $10 million, anchored by
the sale of a work by Zeng Fanzhi that is estimated by Sotheby’s
to fetch as much as $2.6 million.  Tomorrow evening, an oil by  Zhang Xiaogang  from his
Bloodline series has a high estimate of $8.3 million according
to the catalog. At Sotheby’s April sale in the city, Zhang’s
triptych “Forever Lasting Love” fetched HK$79 million with
fees, more than double the HK$30 million top estimate.  A highlight of the Oct. 3 sale of 20th-century Chinese Art
is an abstract landscape oil painted by Zao Wou-ki in 1968 that
is estimated to sell for as much as $4.5 million. Sotheby’s is
also offering 36 works by  Zhang Daqian .  Oct. 5 will feature the second installment of the
Meiyintang collection of Chinese porcelain assembled over six
decades by Stephen Zuellig, a Swiss businessman whose family
made its fortune distributing pharmaceuticals.  That day will also see 358 lots of jewelry offered,
including a ring featuring a 9.27 carat pink diamond known as
the Golconda Pink that carries a high estimate of $19 million.  Singer’s Jewels  Jewels and watches from the estate of  Hong Kong  actress and
singer Anita Mui, who died in 2003, also go under the hammer on
Oct. 5, followed the next day by the final sale of watches.  Buyer’s premium, the commission added to the hammer price
of works sold, is 25 percent for the first HK$400,000, 20
percent for lots fetching as much as HK$8 million, and 12
percent above that. The wine premium is a flat 21 percent.
Estimates reflect the hammer price, before premium.  Potential buyers who aren’t represented at the  Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Centre  sale can bid via Sotheby’s
 online bidding system .  To contact the writer on the story:
