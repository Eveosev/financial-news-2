Thousands of Hungarians rallied in
central Budapest against the measures of Prime Minister  Viktor
Orban  at a demonstration organizers dubbed “D-Day.”  Protesters demanded “fair” taxation, the constitutional
protection of early retirement, the restoration of the right to
strike, social dialog and the scrapping of retroactive laws.  Organizers, consisting of almost 100 trade unions and civic
organizations, estimated the number of participants at close to
50,000 people, news portal nol.hu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
