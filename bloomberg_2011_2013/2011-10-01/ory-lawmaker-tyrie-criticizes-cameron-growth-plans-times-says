U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
plans to inject growth into the economy should be reworked,
according to a member of the Conservative party, the London-
based  Times  said.  Andrew Tyrie , the chairman of the House of Commons Treasury
Select Committee, said the government’s “piecemeal policies”
need “radical improvement,” the newspaper reported.  “There is much to do, and it is not just a question of
gaps in policy,” he told the newspaper. “A coherent and
credible plan for the long-term economic growth rate of the U.K.
economy is needed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
