U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said the U.K. “will never join the single currency” during his
premiership, according to an article he wrote for the  Daily
Mail .  Deficit reduction is essential for lowering interest rates,
keeping the debt burden down and stoking economic growth,
Cameron wrote. The U.K. can “lay the foundations of a more
solid future” on its own terms because it is outside the euro
area, according to the article.  The government is seeking to facilitate growth, investment
and job creation, while capping immigration to preserve
workplaces for British citizens and overhauling the welfare
system, he wrote.  “We’re overturning the convention of recent times: the
idea that it’s governments that create jobs,” Cameron wrote.
“No, they don’t. Businesses do.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
