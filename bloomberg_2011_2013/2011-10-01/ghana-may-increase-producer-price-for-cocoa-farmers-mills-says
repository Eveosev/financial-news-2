Ghana , the world’s second-largest
cocoa producer, may increase the producer price for the nation’s
farmers, said President John Atta Mills.  “We have heard the calls from the farmers for further
increases in producer price,” Mills said, without giving
details. “We will consider it.”  Mills was addressing farmers today at the Cocoa Producers’
Alliance’s Cocoa Day celebration in Kumasi, the nation’s second-
largest city, about 270 kilometers (168 miles) north of the
capital, Accra.  Ghana will promote local consumption of the beans, seeking
to double per capita to 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) from 0.5
kilograms, said Anthony Fofie, chief executive officer of the
Ghana cocoa board. “We can’t try to control the price on the
world market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
