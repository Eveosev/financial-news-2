Bahrainis went to the polls today to
vote in a run-off round of special parliamentary elections after
candidates in nine constituencies failed to win an outright
majority in last weekâ€™s vote.  The Sept. 24 special elections were held to fill 18 seats
in the 40-member parliament vacated by the  al-Wefaq  group, the
biggest Shiite Muslim party. Al-Wefaq lawmakers quit in
objection to a crackdown on mostly Shiite demonstrators who held
rallies in February and March. At least 35 people died in
protest-related violence.  Five candidates were declared winners in the Oct. 24 vote,
while four candidates won seats before the elections were held
after their competitors withdrew.  To contact the reporter on this story:
