Fiat SpA (F) , Italy’s biggest automaker,
is ready to take advantage of any opportunities that may arise
from the current economic crisis, Chairman John Elkann said.  “Crises are good times to recalculate priorities and grab
opportunities like we did in 2008-2009 with Chrysler,” Elkann
told reporters today at a conference in Courmayeur, Italy. “We
are ready to take hold of any opportunities that may come up.”  Fiat gained control of Chrysler Group LLC as part of the
U.S. automaker’s 2009 bankruptcy reorganization. Fiat was
downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service on Sept. 21 on concerns
about increasing competition and that the combination with
Chrysler will leave it responsible for the U.S. automaker’s
debt. Fiat’s European market share through August shrank to 7.3
percent from 8.2 percent a year earlier as deliveries plunged.  The company hasn’t made a decision yet on which car models
to make at its Mirafiori plant near Turin,  Italy , after Chief
Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  said in August that he may
change production plans for the plant.  “We’re still working on the plan,” Elkann said, declining
to give details.  To contact the reporters on this story:
