Treasuries advanced in the third
quarter the most since the depths of the financial crisis in
2008 as Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis and a sluggish U.S.
economy spurred demand for the world’s safest assets.  Yields on 30-year bonds dropped below 3 percent this week
as investors poured into the securities before the  Federal
Reserve  begins purchasing longer-term debt and selling shorter
maturities under Operation Twist in two days.  U.S. debt 
securities rose in September before next week’s payrolls report,
forecast to show the  unemployment rate  stayed at 9.1 percent.  “There’s increasing  risk aversion ,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $1.7 billion as chief investment officer
at the United Nations Federal Credit Union in New York. “It’s
mainly influenced by perceptions of the European sovereign-debt
crisis. The underlying data in the U.S. have been largely weak,
and that’s also encouraged flows into  Treasury securities , as
has the Fed’s Operation Twist.”  Yields on 30-year bonds decreased 70 basis points, or 0.70
percentage point in September to 2.91 percent yesterday in  New
York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  Thirty-year yields tumbled 146 basis points in the third
quarter in the biggest drop since the period ended December
2008. Benchmark 10-year yields slid 125 basis points, the
biggest decrease in almost three years. The yields touched
1.6714 percent on Sept. 23, the lowest in Fed figures beginning
in 1953. Two-year yields fell 22 basis points.  Bond Returns  Treasuries returned 6 percent in the third quarter through
Sept. 29, the most on a quarterly basis since the fourth quarter
of 2008. Treasuries with maturities of 10 years or longer
returned 22 percent in the third quarter, the most since 1980,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Stocks
tumbled, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index falling 13 percent
in the biggest quarterly drop since the last three months of
2008.  “There is a sense in the Treasury market that lower growth
and a deflationary outcome is the base-case scenario,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist at BTIG LLC in New York.
“With central banks moving toward more accommodative positions,
there is little impetus for rates to rise, maybe for years.”  This week’s $35 billion auction of five-year notes and the
$29 billion of seven-year securities drew record low yields. The
$35 billion auction of two-year notes produced the highest
demand in a year.  Fed’s Debt Buying  Yields on 30-year bonds tumbled 41 basis points during the
week including Sept. 21, when the central bank announced it
would buy $400 billion of U.S. debt with maturities of six to 30
years through June while selling an equal amount of securities
due in three years or less.  The central bank said yesterday it will buy $44 billion of
longer-maturity Treasuries and sell the same amount of shorter-
term debt this month. Purchases will begin Oct. 3 with the
 acquisition  of $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion of Treasuries
maturing between February 2036 and August 2041, according to a
statement from the New York Fed.  “Bonds could go potentially 40 basis points lower,” said
Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist in New York at Credit
Suisse Group AG, one of 20 primary dealers that trade directly
with the Fed.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 30-year U.S. bonds
instead of two-year notes fell yesterday to 265 basis points.
The spread shrank to 260 basis points on Sept. 22, the least on
a closing basis since February 2009.  Bullard’s View  St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  said yesterday in  San
Diego  that the central bank is prepared to ease policy should
the  U.S. economy  weaken, while keeping an eye on inflation
risks. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is scheduled to testify
before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on Oct. 4.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt known as the
break-even rate, fell to 1.76 percentage points. The average
over the past 12 months is 2.26 percentage points.  The U.S. added 50,000 positions in September after zero job
growth in the previous month, according to the median forecast
of 67 economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the Labor
Department’s report Oct. 7.  Ten-year yields will increase to 2.20 percent by year-end,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
banks and securities firms, with the most recent forecasts given
the heaviest weightings. On Aug. 12, yields were projected to
finish 2011 at 2.72 percent.  Europe ’s leaders are turning their focus to the next steps
to stem the region’s debt crisis after German lawmakers approved
an expansion of the euro-area rescue fund that raises  Germany ’s
guarantees to 211 billion euros ($285 billion) from 123 billion
euros. The nation won’t increase its contribution further, the
 Finance Ministry  said yesterday.  “Europe is a wild card,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of
Treasury trading at Bank of Nova Scotia in New York. “It’s
still something everyone is going to be looking at.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
