Gabon agreed to borrow $370 million
from the  African Development Bank  for the second phase of a
national project to improve highways to the capital, Libreville,
and in the southwest, according to a statement broadcast on
Radio Television Gabonaise.  The Gabonese government aims to finish building 2,000
kilometers of roads in the next six years. The national road
network includes 9,170 kilometers of roads.  The Africa Development Bank, the main source of funding for
the project, and its co-lender, the French Development Agency,
asked the operators to lower the price per kilometer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
