Nestle SA (NESN) , the world’s biggest food
company, is aiming its latest dog food advertisements directly
at canine consumers, the  Financial Times  said, citing Gerardo
Perez-Camargo, a veterinarian at the company’s Purina unit.  The ads, due to appear on Austrian television this week,
contain squeaks, high-frequency tones and high-pitched pings,
the newspaper reported.  Perez-Camargo said the commercials used the sounds to raise
dogs’ awareness, encouraging owners to buy Nestle’s Beneful
brand pet food, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
