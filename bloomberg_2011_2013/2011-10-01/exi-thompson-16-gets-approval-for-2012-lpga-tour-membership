Sixteen-year-old Lexi Thompson was
approved for LPGA membership starting in 2012, two weeks after
becoming the youngest golfer to win on the top women’s tour.  “I’ve been waiting for this moment,” Thompson said
yesterday on a conference call. “I’m looking forward to it.”  Under LPGA rules, a player between the ages of 15 and 18
has to petition for membership. Thompson filed the petition
after winning the Navistar LPGA Classic in Prattville,  Alabama ,
by five shots, and Commissioner Michael Whan decided yesterday
to waive the tour’s age limit in her case.  “Lexi Thompson is a unique talent who has continued to
grow, develop and mature both on and off the golf course since
turning professional in 2010,” Whan said in a  statement . “Her
ability to handle the success and disappointment inherent to
this game testifies to a level of maturity that I believe makes
her capable of handling the emotional rigors of professional
golf.”  Thompson previously received a waiver for the LPGA’s
qualifying school for 2012 membership and won the opening stage
in July by 10 strokes.  Thompson’s victory in Alabama earlier this month -- against
a field that included 45 of the top 50 players on the tour’s
money list -- broke Paula Creamer’s record as the youngest LPGA
winner by more than two years. Creamer was 18 years and nine
months old when she captured the 2005 Sybase Open.  “Clearly, there is great enthusiasm and excitement as Lexi
begins her LPGA career,” Whan said. “I think her future is
bright and I hope she makes the most of this opportunity.”  When she was 12 years old in 2007, Thompson became the
youngest golfer to qualify for the U.S. Women’s Open. She won
the U.S. Junior Girls’ Championship in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
