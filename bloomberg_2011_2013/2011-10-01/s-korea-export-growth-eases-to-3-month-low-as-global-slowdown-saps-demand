South Korea ’s exports expanded at the
slowest pace in three months in September, in a sign the
stalling global economy is sapping demand for the nation’s
products.  Exports climbed 19.6 percent from a year earlier, compared
with a revised 25.9 percent gain in August, the Ministry of
 Knowledge Economy  said today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 11 economists was for a 16.6 percent gain.  Policy makers are weighing the risk that a slowdown in
demand from the faltering U.S. and European economies will
outweigh increased export competitiveness following a more than
4 percent decline in the won against the dollar this year. South
Korea is also struggling to contain inflation, which surged to a
three-year high of 5.3 percent in August.  “Exporters can enjoy the benefit from a falling won to
some extent but global demand is the key issue,” Park Sang Hyun, chief economist at HI Investment & Securities Co. in
 Seoul , said before the release. “The  Bank of Korea  appears to
be really cautious over any rate move.”  The won fell 0.4 percent to 1,178.10 per dollar in Seoul
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
slid 9.4 percent this quarter, its steepest slump since the
three months ended September 2008. The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  rose 0.36, or
less than 0.1 percent, to 1,769.65 yesterday. The equities
benchmark declined 16 percent in the quarter, its biggest drop
since the last three months of 2008.  4% Growth  The nation’s economy will grow at an annual pace of about
mid-4 percent from 2011 to 2015, the  finance ministry  said on
Sept. 27. The IMF cut its forecast for South Korea’s 2011 GDP
growth to 4 percent from 4.5 percent on Sept. 20. The economy
grew 3.4 percent from a year earlier in the second quarter, the
slowest pace in seven quarters.  Exports rose to $47.1 billion from $45.9 billion in August,
today’s report showed. Imports climbed 30.5 percent to $45.7
billion. The  trade surplus  was $1.4 billion.  Shipments to  Europe  rose 11.2 percent from a year earlier
in the first 20 days of September, the ministry said today.
Shipments to  China , the biggest buyer of South Korean goods,
increased 20.5 percent. Exports to the U.S. rose 15.9 percent.
Data for exports to individual countries are only available for
the first 20 days of the month.  Chips, Ships  Exports of semiconductors fell 4.2 percent last month while
oil product exports surged 56.8 percent, the ministry said.
Shipments of vessels fell 32.7 percent while vehicle exports
gained 40 percent.  South Korea’s trade surplus may not widen in the fourth
quarter because exports are expected to slow as global economies
slump, while the value of imports will probably rise due to high
 oil prices , the ministry said.  Two of three exporters said they may not meet their targets
this year, citing weakening demand in major markets and currency
volatility, according to a Korea Chamber of Commerce and
Industry survey of 500 companies, released on Sept. 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
