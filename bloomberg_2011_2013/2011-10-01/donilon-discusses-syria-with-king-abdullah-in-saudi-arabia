White House National Security Advisor
Tom Donilon thanked  Saudi Arabia ’s  King Abdullah  and the Gulf
Cooperation Council for their opposition to violence in Syria
“perpetrated by the Assad regime” during a visit to Saudi
Arabia today, according to a White House statement.  During a one-day visit to Riyadh, Donilon “commended”
King Abdullah for his call for “an end to violence against
civilians” led by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime,
White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said in a statement.  Assad’s oppression has left more than 3,600 civilians dead
since the protests began in March, according to Ammar Qurabi of
the National Organization for Human Rights in Syria. About
30,000 people have been detained and 13,000 are still being
held, Qurabi said. About 700 members of the state security
forces have been killed in the uprising.  American Ambassador  Robert Ford , a critic of Assad, escaped
an attack by a mob in Damascus two days ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
