Mobile Telecommunications Co. of
 Saudi Arabia , or Zain Saudi Arabia, tumbled the most in six
weeks after  Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM)  and  Bahrain Telecom Co. (BATELCO) 
abandoned their offer to purchase a stake.  The shares declined 2.4 percent, the largest loss since
Aug. 14, to 6.10 riyals at the 3:30 p.m. close in  Riyadh  after
trading down as much as 4.8 percent.  Kingdom and Bahrain Telecom, known as Batelco, said on
Sept. 29 that they won’t proceed with a $950 million bid for
Zain Group’s 25 percent stake in Zain Saudi Arabia, the
country’s third-largest mobile-phone company by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
