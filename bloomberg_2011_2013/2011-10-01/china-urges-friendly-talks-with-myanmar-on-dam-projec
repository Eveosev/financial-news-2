China’s Ministry of  Foreign Affairs 
called for “friendly talks” after Myanmar suspended the
construction of a hydroelectric dam being built by both nations.  China has always upheld “mutual respect” and “mutual
benefit” in cooperation with other countries, the ministry said
today on its  website . Other governments should also respect the
lawful and appropriate rights of Chinese companies, it said.  “The Myitsone dam is a joint venture between China and
Myanmar,” according to the statement. “Both sides should have
friendly talks over matters related to the project.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
