Warren Buffett , the billionaire
investor, said Wall Street bankers don’t believe they’ve been
embraced by President Barack Obama and are consequently
withholding their support.  “Wall Street certainly doesn’t feel loved,” Buffett told
 Charlie Rose  in an interview broadcast on PBS. “I think there
was some rhetoric that contributed to that.”  Buffett, 81, is seeking to draw backers for Obama’s re-
election and planned to attend a fundraiser for the president in
 New York . The chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. did at least
five television interviews yesterday on topics ranging from
politics to the economy to the European debt crisis. On PBS,
Buffett said that Obama’s policies helped banks recover from the
recession.  “You take the number of people making a million dollars or
over on  Wall Street  and you can fill a very large auditorium,”
Buffett said. “I think the president felt, ‘My God, look at all
the things we did for business, and they’re unappreciative, and
I’m all that stands between them and the pitchforks.’”  Obama has been accused of “class warfare” by Republicans
including House Speaker  John Boehner  for seeking to close the
deficit by raising taxes on the wealthy. Obama has asked
Congress to enact a so-called Buffett rule, requiring those
earning annual incomes of $1 million or more to pay taxes at a
rate similar to that of middle-income Americans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
