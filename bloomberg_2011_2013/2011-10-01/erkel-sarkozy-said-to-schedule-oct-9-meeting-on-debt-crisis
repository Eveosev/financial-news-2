German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  will
meet French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  in Berlin on Oct. 9 to
discuss the European debt crisis, said a person familiar with
the plan who declined to be identified because the date hasn’t
been formally announced.  Steffen Seibert, Merkel’s chief spokesman, declined to
comment on the date of the meeting to Bloomberg News today,
saying that the two leaders plan to meet before the next
European Union Council summit in mid-October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
