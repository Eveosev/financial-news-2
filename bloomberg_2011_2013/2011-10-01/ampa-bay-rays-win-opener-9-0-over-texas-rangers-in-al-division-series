Kelly Shoppach drove in five runs
with a pair of home runs and the  Tampa Bay Rays  defeated the
Texas Rangers 9-0 in the opener of their American League
Division Series.  Johnny Damon  added a two-run homer and Matt Moore allowed
two hits in seven innings for the Rays, who ended the regular
season with five straight wins to capture a playoff spot. It was
the second major league start for the 22-year-old Moore, who was
called up from the minors earlier this month.  The New York Yankees host the Detroit Tigers tonight in
Game 1 of the other AL Division Series. The game features the
two pitchers with the most wins in the American League this
season -- Justin Verlander (24-5) of the Tigers against CC
Sabathia (19-8) of the Yankees.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
