Swiss Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said the central bank’s franc ceiling of 1.20
versus the euro is at the right level, Reuters reported.  “We see it’s a very good measure and the”  Swiss National
Bank  “has chosen the appropriate level,” Widmer-Schlumpf told
 Reuters  in an interview today. “We expect it to work, but there
is no guarantee. If things don’t work out as we expect them to,
we could see inflation.”  Asked whether the currency ceiling could be increased to
1.25 or 1.30, Widmer-Schlumpf said “that is not for me to say,
the SNB evaluates this regularly. From today’s point of view,
one can say that the measure has brought the hoped-for
success.” She also said that “at the moment,  capital controls 
and negative  interest rates  are not a topic but they are being
examined. One needs to get ready for certain steps, hoping one
will never have to take them,” she told Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
