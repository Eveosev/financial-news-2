A Qatari sovereign wealth fund is
holding talks to invest $1 billion in  European Goldfields Ltd. (EGU) ,
the London-listed company behind one of the biggest gold-mining
projects in Greece,  Sky News  said, without citing anyone for the
information.  Qatar Holding LLC, owner of the department store Harrods,
is poised to sign a deal that will give it a big shareholding in
European Goldfields, which is listed on the London and Toronto
stock exchanges, according to the  Sky News  website.  The deal could be announced as early as today and, assuming
it goes through, will be confirmed in a statement on Oct. 3, Sky
said. Qatar Holding and European Goldfields were both
unavailable for comment, Sky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
