A majority of Germans - 78 percent -
expects that the European Financial Stability Facility will need
to be expanded further to tackle the European debt crisis, a
survey by polling company Emnid GmbH for the Bild-am-Sonntag
newspaper showed.  Another 19 percent said the fund will not require further
expansion, according to the poll. Bild said Emnid surveyed 504
people on Sept. 29 and did not give a margin for error.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
