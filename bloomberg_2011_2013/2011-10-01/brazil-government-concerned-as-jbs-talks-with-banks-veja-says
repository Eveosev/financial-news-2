The Brazilian government is concerned
about talks held by  JBS SA (JBSS3)  with banks, as it looks for financing
to a possible merger with rivals  Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3)  and
Minerva SA,  Veja columnist Lauro Jardim  reported, without saying
where he got the information.  JBS is the world’s biggest beef producer. Government
officials don’t like the kind of concentration such a merger
could lead to, Veja said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
