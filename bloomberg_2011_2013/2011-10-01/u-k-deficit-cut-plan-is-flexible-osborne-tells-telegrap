U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  said his deficit-cut plan is “flexible” as
slower-than-expected economic growth may delay reducing the
shortfall as targeted, the  Daily Telegraph  reported, citing an
interview.  The government will probably be unable to cut taxes to
boost flagging economic growth before the next general election
in 2015, Osborne told the newspaper.  “I’m not somebody who believes you can fund lower taxes by
borrowing more money,” he told the newspaper.  The current financial crisis is “at least as serious” as
the global credit crunch that followed the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, said Osborne, who is to address
a Conservative Party conference on Oct. 3, the Telegraph said.  Osborne said his No. 1 priority is tackling the  budget
deficit  and to keep the U.K. “safe and secure” in the current
financial turmoil, according to the Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
