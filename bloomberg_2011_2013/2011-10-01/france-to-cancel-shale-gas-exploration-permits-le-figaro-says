The French government is set to
cancel three exploration permits for shale gas and the decision
will probably be made public early next week,  Le Figaro 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The licenses are held by Schuepbach Energy LLC in Ardeche
and Larzac and by  Total SA (FP)  in the Montelimar region, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
