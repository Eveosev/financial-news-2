Turkey  is planning to freeze Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad’s bank accounts after starting an air,
land and sea blockade because the leader won’t heed calls for
political changes, Milliyet reported.  The Turkish Finance Ministry’s criminal investigation unit
is following Syrian banking activities in the country and may
freeze about $500 million of Assad’s assets, the Istanbul-based
newspaper  said , citing officials it didn’t name. Turkey is also
considering travel sanctions on people close to the Syrian
government, Milliyet reported.  Turkey would freeze all of Assad’s assets if the  United
Nations  enacts an embargo on  Syria , Milliyet said. Foreign banks
in Turkey halted transactions with Syria Aug. 15 while local
banks continue exchanges to collect money owed to Turkish
companies, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
