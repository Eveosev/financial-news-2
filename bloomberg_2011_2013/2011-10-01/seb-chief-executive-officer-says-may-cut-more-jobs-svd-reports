Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEBA)  will
have to cut more jobs as tougher regulations force the bank to
reduce costs, the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper reported in an
interview with Chief Executive Officer Annika Falkengren.  “There’s no doubt the total number of employees must come
down” and there’s a “need to slash jobs in the Baltics,” she
was quoted as saying. SEB employs 17,500 people after cutting
3,500 jobs in the past three years, according to the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
