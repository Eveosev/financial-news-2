Western Wind Energy Corp. (WND) , a project
developer focusing on  Canada , the U.S. and Puerto Rico, said it
has informed the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of
Canada of “obvious pre-conditioned trading activity” in recent
months.  The trades occur “almost daily, and also after significant
positive material news announcements,” the company said in a
statement today.  “The company informed IIROC that it has been made aware in
the past few days that a certain party would like to make a
take-over bid of certain or all of the assets of the company,”
the statement said. “The suggested offer price to the company
is above the current market price but below the independent
valuation amount that was announced on Aug. 8.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
