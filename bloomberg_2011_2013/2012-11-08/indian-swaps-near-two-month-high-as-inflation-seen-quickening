India ’s  interest-rate swaps  are near
a two-month high on speculation inflation in  Asia ’s third-
largest economy quickened in October to the highest this year.  The benchmark wholesale-price  index  climbed 8 percent last
month from a year earlier, according to the median of estimate
of 14 economists in a Bloomberg News survey before data due Nov.
14. That would be the biggest increase since November 2011.
Central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao kept borrowing costs
unchanged in his last policy statement on Oct. 30, and signaled
a reduction in local  interest rates  may be possible only after
inflation eases next quarter.  “Swaps are pricing in the possibility of inflation
remaining elevated for sometime,” said N.S. Venkatesh,
treasurer at  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)  in Mumbai.“That will delay
interest-rate cuts.”  The fixed payment to lock in one-year borrowing costs was
at 7.78 percent as of 10:15 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The rate touched 7.79 percent yesterday,
the highest level since Sept. 5.  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent government bonds
due June 2022 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
8.18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
