Opcon AB (OPCO) , a Swedish maker of energy-
saving technology, rose the most in more than a year in
Stockholm trading after saying it agreed to sell business unit
Engine Efficiency with production sites in Sweden and  China .  The shares gained as much as 44 percent, the biggest
intraday advance since Oct. 24, 2011. Opcon had increased 32
percent to 1.46 kronor as of 2:39 p.m. local time.  The buyer, investment fund Perusa Partner Fund 2, will pay
about 218.3 million kronor ($32.6 million) for the business, of
which 90 million kronor is in cash, Opcon said today in a
statement. The purchase sum also includes taking over external
debt and may be adjusted by 10 million kronor based on
performance. The sale strengthens Ocpon’s financial situation
and allows it to focus more on energy and environmental
technology, the company said.  “We are step by step forming an Opcon with greater
focus,” Chief Executive Officer Rolf Hasselstrom said. The sale
of the unit’s two production sites also means streamlining and
cost cuts in the administration on the group level, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
