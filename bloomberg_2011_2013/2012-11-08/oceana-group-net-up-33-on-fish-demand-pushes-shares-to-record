Oceana Group Ltd. (OCE) , the biggest seller
of canned fish in  South Africa , had a 33 percent jump in full-
year earnings as demand outpaced supply and its fishmeal unit
returned to profit, raising the company’s shares to a record.  Net income advanced to 443.8 million rand ($51 million) in
the year ended Sept. 30, from 333.2 million rand a year earlier,
the Cape Town-based company said today in a statement. Revenue
jumped 27 percent to 4.6 billion rand. Oceana’s earnings per
share of 4.08 rand beat the average forecast of 3.49 rand among
three analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “We had exceptionally strong demand for canned fish,”
Chief Executive Officer Francois Kuttel said by phone. “We’ve
increased supply but couldn’t keep up with demand.”  Fishmeal, relying on industrial catches such as anchovies,
turned a 21 million rand profit from a 55 million rand loss as
selling prices held steady even with supply gains, he said. “We
had the best industrial fish catch in a decade,” Kuttel said
from  Cape Town . “There were strong landings of anchovies.”  Oceana, with a 65 percent canned-fish market share mainly
through its Lucky Star brand, had its catch quota increased by
10,000 metric tons to 120,000 tons in South Africa. It imports
fish from Morocco, California and  Thailand .  The company advanced as much as 6.7 percent to the highest
level since the stock began trading in 1990 and was up 1.7
percent at 61 rand by 4:35 p.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
