The French water company  Veolia
Environnement SA (VIE)  said its U.K. environmental services unit
signed a 25-year waste management contract with authorities in
Leeds thatâ€™s worth about 460 million pounds ($735 million).  The municipal waste treatment and energy recovery agreement
includes constructing a recycling facility that the unit said
will save Leeds about 200 million pounds when compared with the
cost of putting residual waste in landfills.  Energy recovered from the East Leeds industrial area
facility, where building is expected to begin next year, will
supply the National Grid with enough electricity to power 20,000
households. The facility should open in the spring 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
