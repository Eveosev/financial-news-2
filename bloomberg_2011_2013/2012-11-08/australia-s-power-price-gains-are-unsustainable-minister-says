Australia ’s rising retail electricity
prices, which have climbed about 40 percent in the past four
years, are unsustainable, Resources Minister  Martin Ferguson 
said today.  “This is hurting households and businesses and it is
simply not sustainable,” Ferguson said in a speech in
 Melbourne . “High prices result from a range of complex factors,
many of which lie outside the control of any single government
or regulator. They include higher production costs and the need
to replace or upgrade aging infrastructure.”  Ferguson today released the government’s energy policy
strategy 11 months after announcing a draft of the report in
which he called for the sale of more state-run energy assets to
help drive  electricity  and gas investments. The industry has a
pipeline of about A$270 billion ($281 billion) of projects in
development, he said.  Other challenges that need to be addressed in Australia’s
energy industry include securing gas and liquid fuel for
domestic use, with closures of refineries expected to reduce
domestic refining capacity by about 28 percent in 2014 from 2012
levels, he said.  “Governments at all levels must embrace key reforms,
including improving the efficiency of electricity networks,
establishing effective competition and removing retail price
caps, providing for greater demand-side participation and moving
towards cost reflective pricing,” Ferguson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
