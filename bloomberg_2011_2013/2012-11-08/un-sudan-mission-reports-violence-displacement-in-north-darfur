The United Nations peacekeeping
mission in  Sudan  said there were signs of violence and
population displacement amid reports of clashes between
government forces and armed groups in North Darfur state.  Unamid, as the UN-African Union force is known, sent a team
Nov. 6 to verify reports of violence in areas southwest of al-
Fasher, the regional capital. It found Sigili village
“completely deserted, with apparent signs of an abrupt
departure,” Unamid said in an e-mailed statement late
yesterday. Housing and property had been destroyed and dead
animals and ammunition were found across the village, it said.  The UN said on Sept. 9 it’s concerned about a resumption of
violence in North Darfur following several shootings and the
attempted assassination of a local official.  Insurgents in Darfur took up arms in 2003, accusing
President Umar al-Bashir’s government of neglecting the region.
The conflict has led to the deaths of as many as 300,000 people,
mainly due to illness and starvation, and forced about 2.7
million to flee their homes, according to UN estimates. The
Sudanese government has put the death toll at about 10,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
