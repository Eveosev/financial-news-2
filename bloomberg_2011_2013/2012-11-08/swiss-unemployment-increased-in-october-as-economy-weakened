Swiss unemployment increased for the
first time in six months in October, suggesting companies
eliminated jobs to weather a deepening European economic slump.  The  jobless rate , adjusted for seasonal swings, rose to 3
percent from 2.9 percent in the previous month, the State
Secretariat for Economic Affairs in Bern said in an e-mailed
statement today. That’s the highest since March 2011 and in line
with the median forecast of 12 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. The unadjusted jobless rate rose to 2.9 percent.  The Swiss economy is faltering as the euro area’s fiscal
crisis and waning global growth erode export demand, forcing
companies to lower costs. Gross domestic product unexpectedly
declined in the second quarter and Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann said on Nov. 6 that “growth in the third
quarter probably disappointed.” The Swiss government will
release third-quarter gross domestic product on Nov. 29.  The number of job openings fell by 44 to 15,726 in October,
today’s report showed. Some 178,532 people were looking for a
job, 7,665 more than in the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
