Nelson Peltz , the head of Trian Fund
Management LP, said  France ’s Danone is undervalued and his firm
plans to “engage” with management to urge the company to avoid
dilutive mergers and acquisitions.  Danone, the world’s largest yogurt maker, is worth 78 euros
a share, Peltz said today in an audio presentation at the Invest
for Kids conference in  Chicago . The stock climbed as much as 4.3
percent in Paris trading, the most in a year, after the
Financial Times reported that Peltz had taken a 1 percent stake.
It  closed  at 48.06 euros, a decline of less than 1 percent.  Peltz won’t press for a breakup or big asset sales of the
Paris-based company, said a person with knowledge of the matter,
who confirmed that Peltz has a stake of about 1 percent. Rather,
Peltz wants  Danone (BN)  to tighten costs and operations and exercise
more discipline with regard to acquisitions, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because the talks are private.
Peltz informed management yesterday that he wants to meet.  Danone is “a mispriced security where the market is
wrong,” Peltz said at the conference. “We believe it’s
undervalued.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
