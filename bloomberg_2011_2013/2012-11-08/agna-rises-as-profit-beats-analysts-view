Magna International Inc. (MG) ,  North
America ’s largest auto-parts maker, rose after third-quarter
earnings beat analysts’ estimates and its founder stepped down
from the board.  The shares rose 0.4 percent to C$44.71 in Toronto at 4:39
p.m. after advancing as much as 5.3 percent earlier, the biggest
intraday jump since July 4. The stock has  risen  32 percent this
year.  Profit surged almost fourfold to $390 million from $102
million a year earlier, in part due to gains from the
acquisition of the controlling stake in its electric car-parts
business, the Aurora, Ontario-based company said in a statement.
Earnings per share excluding the acquisition were $1.13, topping
the average estimate of $1.02 in a Bloomberg survey of 16
analysts. Sales rose 6 percent to $7.4 billion.  Honorary Chairman  Frank Stronach , 80, who founded the
company as a one-man tool-and-die shop in 1957, said he was
leaving the board because of his involvement in Austrian
politics since ceding control of Magna two years ago.  “I do not want my political views to be confused with my
role on Magna’s board,” he said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
