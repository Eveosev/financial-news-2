The zloty weakened to a seven-week
low after  Poland ’s central bank said yesterday it began a series
of interest-rate cuts to boost sputtering economic growth.  The zloty depreciated 0.7 percent to 4.1704 against the
euro at 6:47 p.m. in Warsaw, the weakest since Sept. 20. It
slipped 1.5 percent in a four-day losing streak for the steepest
slide among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Policy makers reduced the main interest rate by 25 basis
points yesterday, Poland’s first since 2009, and Governor  Marek Belka  told reporters the central bank was embarking on an
“easing cycle” with a “rather significant” chance of another
cut in December. The move coincided with the European Commission
yesterday cutting its 2013 growth outlook for Poland to 1.8
percent from 2.6 percent as the euro area debt crisis curbs
exports and domestic demand weakens.  “The start of the easing cycle will act to weaken the
zloty by the end of the year,” Janusz Dancewicz, chief
economist at DZ Bank Polska SA, wrote in an e-mailed comment
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
