Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , rose the most in more than four
months after third-quarter profit exceeded analyst expectations.  The stock advanced 3.75 percent to 415 forint by the end of
trade in Budapest, the biggest gain since June 29. Traders
bought and sold 5.5 million shares, almost four times the daily
average over the last three months, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The benchmark BUX stock  index , in which Magyar
Telekom has a 11 percent weighting, gained 0.9 percent.  Net income climbed to 14.8 billion forint ($67 million)
from 13.3 billion forint a year earlier, the company said in a
statement to the Budapest bourse today. The mean estimate of
eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 11.9 billion forint.  “Magyar Telekom is surging after its earnings,” Zsolt
Balasy, a Budapest-based equities analyst at Bayerische
Landesbank’s MKB unit, wrote in a research report. “Profit beat
estimates by a big margin.”  The company is in the “upper end” of its 2012 projection
of sales being flat to falling as much as 2 percent, Chief
Financial Officer Thilo Kusch told reporters.  “Results are above expectations,” Attila Gyurcsik, head
of research at Concorde Ertekpapir Zrt., wrote in a research
report today, adding that he kept his overweight recommendation
for the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
