Walt Weiss will return to the
 Colorado Rockies  as the Major League Baseball’s team sixth
manager in franchise history.  Weiss, 48, played shortstop for the Rockies from 1994-98
and was a special assistant to the general manager for seven
seasons from 2002-08, the team said on its website.  Weiss, the 1988 American League Rookie of the Year,
replaced Jim Tracy, who quit Oct. 7 after the Rockies finished
in last place in the  National League West  with a 64-98 record.  Last season, Weiss was head coach of the Regis Jesuit High
School baseball team in Aurora, Colorado, which went 20-6 and
reached the semifinals of the state championship.  Weiss, who played parts of 14 seasons with Oakland, Miami,
 Colorado  and Atlanta, earned a batting average of .258 with 25
home runs and 386 runs batted in. He also recorded 96 stolen
bases, 658 walks and 658 strikeouts in 1,495 games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
