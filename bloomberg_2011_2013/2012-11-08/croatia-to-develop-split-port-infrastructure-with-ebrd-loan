The  Croatian government  approved an
18.8 million-euro ($24 million) loan from the  European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development  to upgrade its port in  Split , the
countryâ€™s second-biggest city.  The loan, at the interest rate of Euribor plus 1 percent,
will mature in 15 years with no coupon payments in the first
four years, the Cabinet said in a session today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
