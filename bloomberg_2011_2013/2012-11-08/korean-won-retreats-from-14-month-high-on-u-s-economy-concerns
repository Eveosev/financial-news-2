South Korea’s won retreated from a
14-month high and government bonds advanced as investor focus
turned from U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s re-election to whether
he can push through tax increases and avert spending cuts.  Obama faces the so-called fiscal cliff of more than $600
billion in expiring tax cuts and automatic spending reductions
scheduled to take effect in 2013, while seeking to quicken the
pace of the recovery in the world’s largest economy. The  Kospi (KOSPI) 
index of shares fell 1.2 percent after the Dow Jones Industrial
Average plunged the most in a year yesterday. The Bank of Korea
will hold its benchmark interest  rate  at 2.75 percent at
tomorrow’s policy meeting, after two cuts this year, according
to all 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “Investors who took short bets on the dollar recently may
cover their positions as concern over the fiscal cliff looms,”
said Han Sung Min, a Seoul-based currency trader for Busan Bank.
“Still, with monetary easing expected to continue with the
Obama administration, the won’s losses will be limited,” he
said, referring to Republican challenger  Mitt Romney ’s comments
during the campaign that he wouldn’t reappoint Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke to a third term in 2014. A short
position is a bet an asset will decline in value.  The won weakened 0.4 percent to 1,089.65 per dollar at the
close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,085.40 yesterday, the strongest level since Sept. 9,
2011. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, rose 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 5.38 percent.  South Korea’s currency market opened at 10 a.m. today, an
hour later than usual, to help reduce traffic for the national
college entrance examinations. It closed at the usual time of 3
p.m. in  Seoul .  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2015 declined two basis points to 2.76 percent, the lowest in a
month, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. The one-year interest-
rate swap slid two basis points to 2.73 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
