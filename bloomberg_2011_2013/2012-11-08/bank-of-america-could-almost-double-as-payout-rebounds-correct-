(Corrects to show projected dividend rate is annual in the
second paragraph.)  Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) --  Bank of America Corp .’s stock could
almost double in three years as capital improves, operating
costs decline and mortgage risks ease, according to Ed Najarian,
banking analyst at ISI Group.  Najarian changed his rating to buy from hold, saying in a
note to investors yesterday that Bank of America may be able to
buy back common shares sooner and in greater amounts than he
expected. The  dividend , now 4 cents a share annually, could jump
to an annual 20 cents next year and 40 cents by 2015, ISI wrote.  The stock buyback could amount to 11 percent of common
shares over the next three years, “and that outlook could
easily prove too conservative,” Najarian wrote.  Bank of America is ranked second by assets among U.S.
lenders and is based in Charlotte,  North Carolina . The stock
 closed  at $9.23 yesterday, leading the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average (INDU)  this year with a 66 percent gain. Najarian forecast the
stock could reach $12 a year from now and $18 by the end of
2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
