Bondholders of  India ’s  GTL
Infrastructure Ltd. (GTLI)  approved plans to exchange 35 percent of the
company’s $320 million of convertible bonds due later this month
into equity, according to a person familiar with the matter.  GTL, a Mumbai-based telecommunications tower provider,
plans to convert the U.S. dollar-denominated notes into shares
at a cost of 10 rupees each, the person said, asking not to be
identified because they’re not authorized to speak publicly.  GTL’s stock jumped as much as 11.5 percent to 8.75 rupees
today, and traded up 3.8 percent at 8.15 rupees as of 12:08 p.m.
in Mumbai. Chairman Manoj Tirodkar declined to comment on the
conversion plans and other officials at the company didn’t
immediately reply to an e-mail.  Houlihan Lokey , a Los Angeles-based investment banking
service provider, advised GTL on the transaction, the person
said.  The remaining 65 percent of the bonds can be exchanged for
new convertible notes which mature November 2017, the person
said. Investors also have the option of exchanging all the debt
into equity, the person said.  GTL’s zero-coupon notes mature on Nov. 29 at a premium of
$140.41 per security, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The company has the equivalent of $1.98 billion of bonds and
loans maturing by the end of 2020, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
