Gasoline declined in New York Harbor
today as Motiva Enterprises LLC  resumed  gasoline and diesel
loading at the Sewaren terminal in  New Jersey .  Motiva declared force majeure at four terminals in New York
and New Jersey on Oct. 30, the day after Hurricane Sandy went
ashore in southern New Jersey. Force majeure allows a supplier
to miss deliveries because of circumstances outside its control.  The  premium  for reformulated gasoline in New York dropped 2
cents to 18 cents a gallon versus futures on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 3:37 p.m.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the
harbor fell 1.12 cents to trade at a premium of 15.13 cents over
heating oil futures.  Refineries including  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Bayway and  Hess Corp. (HES) ’s
Port Reading plants have been shut since Sandy made landfall.
Crews are making repairs at Bayway and expect operations to
return to normal in two to three weeks, the company said
yesterday. Utility systems at  Port Reading  were back online
yesterday.  Eighteen tankers carrying petroleum products are scheduled
to make deliveries to New York Harbor over the next three days,
Charles Row, a spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard in Staten
Island, New York, said yesterday in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
