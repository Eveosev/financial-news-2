Braskem SA (BRKM5) , Latin America’s largest
petrochemicals maker, posted a quarterly loss that  surprised 
analysts amid higher costs with advertising and sales.  Net loss was 124 million reais ($61 million) in the third
quarter, the Sao Paulo-based company said in a regulatory filing
today. The result missed estimates of a profit of 32.6 million
reais excluding one-time items, data compiled by Bloomberg with
six analysts show. The company posted a loss of 1.05 billion
reais a year earlier.  General and administrative expenses rose 4 percent to 291
million reais because of the sponsoring of the Rio +20 Earth
Summit, audit services and institutional campaigns, the company
said today. Selling expenses climbed 16 percent because of
“stronger sales and the addition of the new polypropylene
assets,” according to the statement.  Net sales rose 9 percent to 9.45 billion reais.  Financial expenses fell 72 percent to 568 million reais,
after currency losses from a year ago didn’t repeat. Fitch
Ratings cited “concern about the company’s ability to lower its
leverage levels” on Oct. 26 when it lowered Braskem’s credit
outlook to negative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
