U.K. pig slaughter this year may top
10 million head for the first time since 2002, in part as high
feed costs spurred producers to liquidate sows, Agriculture &
Horticulture Development Board said today in an online report.  Pig slaughter may rise to 10.068 million head, up from 9.8
million in 2011, according to the  report  from AHDB’s pig unit
BPEX. About 14,000 more sows were slaughtered between mid-June
and mid-October than in the same period last year. Downsizing
may continue through the end of this year, so the U.K. pig
breeding herd may total about 405,000 by December, AHDB said.
Next year, the total pig slaughter may drop to 9.9 million head,
it said.  “Looking ahead to 2013, the expected reductions in the
breeding herd should outweigh productivity improvements,” AHDB
said. “The decline will accelerate as the year progresses when
the full impact of the fall in the breeding herd will be
apparent.”  U.K. pork production may total 827,000 metric tons this
year, up from 806,000 tons in 2011, AHDB said. In 2013, output
may drop to 809,000 tons. Pork imports may total 975,000 tons in
2012, up from 960,000 tons in 2011. Next year, imports may drop
to 940,000 tons. Consumer demand may fall “particularly if
retail prices increase in response to higher pig prices,” AHDB
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
