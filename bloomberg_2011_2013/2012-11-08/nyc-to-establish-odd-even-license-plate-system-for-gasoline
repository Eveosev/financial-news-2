New York City Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  signed an emergency order to establish an odd-even license plate system for gasoline and diesel purchases to reduce wait times and lines at gas stations in the five boroughs.  The city is implementing the odd-even system - starting 6 a.m. tomorrow - to accelerate the recovery of the distribution network and ease disruptions and wait times for drivers attempting to fuel their vehicles, Bloomberg said today in a statement.  Hurricane Sandy  caused flooding and damage to petroleum infrastructure throughout the tri-state region - causing refineries to shutdown, pumping stations to lose electricity and terminals in the region to close.
