The  New York Mets  are fielding a Gulf
Coast League team after a one-year hiatus.  The Gulf Coast Mets, a rookie-level club, will play out of
the Major League Baseball franchise’s spring training facility
in Port St. Lucie, Florida, according to an e-mailed release.
The team operated as a Mets affiliate every season from
2004-2011 before being eliminated last season.  General Manager  Sandy Alderson  said in the release that the
team was re-formed because the Mets needed more roster space to
develop young players. Last year’s hiatus had nothing to do with
money, spokesman  Jay Horwitz  said today in an e-mail.  New York was 74-88 last season, and finished fourth in the
National League East for the fourth consecutive season. The team
has made the playoffs once in the last 12 season, and last year
drew 2.24 million fans, its lowest total since 2003, according
to ESPN.  Gulf Coast League  teams play a 60-game schedule. Player are
not allowed more than two years of minor-league experience.  The Mets are one of three MLB franchises with nine minor
league affiliates, according to the release, joining the  Seattle
Mariners  and Tampa Bay Rays. Eleven other MLB teams have eight
minor-league affiliates, while the remaining 16 franchises have
seven minor-league clubs.  Earlier this year the Mets named the Las Vegas 51s their
new Triple-A affiliate, replacing the Buffalo Bisons.  -- Editor: Michael Sillup  To contact the reporter on this story:
