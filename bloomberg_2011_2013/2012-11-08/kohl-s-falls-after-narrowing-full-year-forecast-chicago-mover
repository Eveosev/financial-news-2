Kohl’s Corp. (KSS) , the third-largest U.S.
department-store chain, fell the most in more than five months
after narrowing its full-year profit forecast.  Kohl’s  slipped  5.1 percent to $51.55 at the close in  New
York  for the largest one-day drop since May 31. The shares have
gained 4.5 percent this year.  Full-year profit will be $4.52 to $4.60 a share, the
 Menomonee Falls , Wisconsin-based retailer said today in a
statement. That compared with a previous projection of $4.50 to
$4.65 a share. When the numbers were announced, analysts had
anticipated $4.62, the average of  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Net income in the third-quarter rose 1.9 percent to $215
million, or 91 cents a share, from $211 million, or 80 cents, a
year earlier, Kohl’s said. That beat the 88-cent average of
analysts’ estimates.  The retailer ended the quarter with 1,146 stores in 49
states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
