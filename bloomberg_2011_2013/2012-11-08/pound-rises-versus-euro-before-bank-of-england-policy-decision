The pound weakened for a second day
against the dollar before the  Bank of England  announces whether
it will boost monetary stimulus for the first time since July.  Sterling declined to a two-week low versus the U.S.
currency as a Bloomberg News survey showed 35 out of 45
economists forecast the central bank will maintain its asset-
purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds ($600 billion). Policy
makers increased bond purchases, or so-called quantitative
easing, by 50 billion pounds in July to boost the economy. U.K.
government bonds advanced.  “The majority of the market is not expecting anything from
the Bank of England today given improvement in U.K. data and
comments from policy makers,” said  Peter Frank , global head of
foreign-exchange strategy at  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. (BBVA) 
“A slight sterling rally against the dollar and the euro would
be the knee-jerk reaction to no change in policy, simply because
a small section of the market is expecting more QE.”  The pound fell 0.2 percent to $1.5951 at 11:29 a.m. London
time after declining to $1.5930, the weakest since Oct. 23 when
it declined to $1.5914. The U.K. currency was little changed at
79.91 pence per euro.  BBVA predicts the pound will strengthen to 78 pence per
euro by year-end, London-based Frank said, citing the improving
outlook for the U.K. economy relative to the euro area.  Inflation Concern  Bank of England officials will confront increasing concerns
about the potency of their main policy tool today as they
consider halting bond purchases for an economy that may still
need support.  Governor  Mervyn King  and the Monetary Policy Committee must
decide whether to rely on QE to bolster the cooling economy, or
focus on credit-boosting initiatives such as the Funding for
Lending Scheme. Adding to the debate are warnings from some
officials that looser policy now may not be the right move as
inflation slows less than previously forecast.  The central bank completed its latest 50 billion pounds of
bond purchases last week, and Deputy Governors  Paul Tucker  and
 Charles Bean  have suggested that asset purchases may no longer
have the same impact on the economy as when first introduced in
March 2009.  The pound gained 1.4 percent this year according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro fell 3.3 percent, while
the dollar dropped 1.5 percent.  The U.K. 10-year yield dropped one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.75 percent after falling to 1.73 percent,
the lowest since Oct. 15. The 1.75 percent bond due in September
2022 gained 0.105, or 1.05 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount,
to 100.02.  Gilts have returned 3.2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds gained 3.9 percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
