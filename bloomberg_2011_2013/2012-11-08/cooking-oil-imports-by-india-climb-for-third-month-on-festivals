Cooking-oil imports by India, the
world’s second-largest user, probably climbed for a third month
in October after a slump in  palm oil  prices spurred traders to
stockpile to meet festival demand.  Purchases rose 6 percent to 950,000 metric tons from
894,045 tons a year earlier, according to the median of
estimates from five processors and brokers compiled by
Bloomberg. Imports of crude and refined palm oils jumped 23
percent to 750,000 tons, the survey showed. The  Solvent
Extractors’ Association of India  will publish data next week.  Palm oil, which accounts for more than 80 percent of
India’s imports, tumbled to a three-year low of 2,230 ringgit on
Oct. 3 as slowing economies from  China  to  Europe  curbed demand
for food and fuel, pushing inventories to an all-time high in
 Malaysia . Rising Indian purchases may help pare  reserves  in
Malaysia that’s forecast by Godrej International Ltd. Director
Dorab Mistry to reach 3 million tons by January.  “October and November are the high-consumption months in
India because of festivals,”  Atul Chaturvedi , chief executive
officer of Adani Wilmar Ltd., said in a phone interview from
Ahmedabad. “Palm oil was the cheapest among the oils so there
was good demand for it.”  Palm oil for delivery in January dropped 2.5 percent to
2,336 ringgit ($763) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange
yesterday. Futures have fallen 26 percent this year, heading for
a second annual drop.  Record Imports  Vegetable oil purchases are estimated at an all-time high
of more than 10 million tons in the year ended Oct. 31 because
of rising consumption and a decline in local oilseed crop, said
Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive officer of Mumbai-based trader
Sunvin Group. Imports were a record 9.24 million tons in
2009-2010, according to data from the extractors’ association.  Shipments in the 11 months through September jumped 18
percent to 9.16 million tons, according to the extractors’
association.  India  bought 8.7 million tons in 2010-2011.  “The new crop is just coming in, so traders imported more
to meet local demand,” Ashok Sethia, executive director of
Sethia Oils Ltd., said by phone from Kolkata. “Prices were
falling and everyone thought it is the right time to buy.”  Crude  soybean-oil  imports probably fell to 100,000 tons in
October from 186,836 tons a year earlier, while sunflower-oil
purchases may have climbed to 70,000 tons from 64,420 tons, the
survey showed.  “Imports will now taper off as the new crop arrives,”
Bajoria said. Stockpiles at ports are estimated at about 850,000
tons as of Nov. 1, he said. Reserves were 880,000 tons on Oct.
1, the extractors’ data showed.  India buys palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia, and
 soybean oil  from Brazil and  Argentina .  To contact the reporter on this story:
