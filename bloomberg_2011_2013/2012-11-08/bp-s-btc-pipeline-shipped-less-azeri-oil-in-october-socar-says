BP Plc (BP/) ’s Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan, or BTC,
pipeline shipped less Azeri crude oil in October, according to
data published today on the  website  of State Oil Co. of
Azerbaijan, a partner in the project also known as Socar.  The link connecting Azerbaijan’s Caspian Sea coast with
 Turkey ’s Mediterranean port of Ceyhan via  Georgia  delivered 2.16
million metric tons of oil last month, a decline of 18 percent
from a year earlier. BTC exported 25 million tons of oil in the
first 10 months of 2012, down from 27.9 million tons in the
year-earlier period, the data showed. No explanation was given
for the drop.  Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil producer in the former
Soviet Union after Russia and Kazakhstan, reported a 7.1 percent
drop in crude production to 22.2 million tons in the first half
after the country’s Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli, or ACG, field cut
output 12 percent, Socar said in July.  The BP-led field is expected to keep output stable at 33
million tons next year after BP was criticized by Azeri
President Ilham Aliyev last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
