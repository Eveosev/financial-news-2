Kenya ’s shilling advanced for a third
day, its longest winning streak in five weeks, as businesses
sold dollars after the central bank lowered its benchmark
interest rate for a third time this year to boost the economy.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy appreciated
as much as 0.2 percent to 85.25 per dollar, and traded less than
0.1 percent stronger at 85.32 by 11:05 a.m. in Nairobi, the
longest stretch of gains since Oct. 3, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, led by
Governor Njuguna Ndung’u, lowered the  benchmark  interest rate by
2 percentage points to 11 percent, the bank said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. The economy grew 3.3 percent between April
and June, the slowest pace in 10 quarters, as record interest
rates stifled lending and  Europe ’s debt crisis undermined tea
and flower exports.  “Some players in the market had bought dollars ahead of
the decision, expecting a larger than 200 basis points rate cut,
prompting them to cut their dollar positions,” Nairobi-based
NIC Bank Ltd. said in a note to clients. The bank expects the
shilling to trade within a range of 85 to 85.50 a dollar today,
it said in the note.  “The market is reviewing its long dollar position which is
giving support to the shilling,” Duncan Kinuthia, head of
trading at Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone.  Uganda’s shilling weakened for the fourth day, depreciating
0.3 percent to 2,592.50 a dollar, while the Tanzanian shilling
traded unchanged at 1,591 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
