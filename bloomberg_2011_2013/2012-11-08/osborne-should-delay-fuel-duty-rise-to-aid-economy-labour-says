Britain’s opposition  Labour Party 
called on Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  to delay an
increase in fuel duty that is due in January, seeking to force
the government into a second U-turn on the issue.  Labour lawmaker  Ed Balls , the party’s spokesman on Treasury
affairs, said the planned increase should be put back until
April at least to help prevent the economy from tipping back
into recession.  “This is no time for complacency,” Balls said in an
article published on the PoliticsHome.com website. “A strong
economic recovery is far from secured. It cannot be right to hit
middle and low-income families and small businesses with another
tax increase.”  In June, Osborne scrapped an increase in fuel duty that had
been due to take effect in August, his fourth policy retreat in
a month.  The 3 pence (4.8 U.S. cents) per-liter increase is due to
go ahead on Jan. 1 instead. The delay will cost the Treasury 550
million pounds and be paid for by savings from government
departments.  Labour will call for a vote on delaying the increase on
Nov. 12 during a House of Commons debate. The outcome of any
vote wouldn’t be binding on the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
