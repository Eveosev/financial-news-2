Sumitomo Realty & Development Co. (8830) ,
 Japan ’s third-biggest developer, posted a 13 percent gain in
first-half profit because of rising leasing revenue and improved
profitability at its home sales business.  Net income rose to 26.4 billion yen ($330 million) for the
six months ended Sept. 30 from 23.3 billion yen a year earlier,
the Tokyo-based company said today in a statement through the
stock exchange. Sales gained 2.1 percent to 314 billion yen.  Sumitomo Realty joins Mitsui Fudosan Co. and Mitsubishi
Estate Co. in reporting profit increase driven by higher sales.
Sumitomo Realty’s leasing profit rose 5.8 percent after the
opening of two office buildings in Tokyo boosted its revenue
from commercial rents, while its profit for the residential
business gained 19 percent.  Sumitomo Realty kept its full-year profit forecast at 58
billion yen for the year ending March 2012 on sales of 720
billion yen.  The  shares  declined 2.3 percent to 2,212 yen at the close
of trading on the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange after the results. The
stock had its biggest drop since Sept. 20, cutting its year-to-
date gain to 64 percent. That compares with the 44 percent
advance by the 44-member Topix Real Estate Index this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
