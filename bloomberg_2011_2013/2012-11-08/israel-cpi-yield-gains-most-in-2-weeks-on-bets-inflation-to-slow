Israel ’s six-year consumer price-
linked  government bonds  fell, pushing the yield up the most in
two weeks, on investor bets inflation will moderate in the
coming months as economic growth slows.  The yield on the 3.5 percent consumer price-linked notes
due August 2018 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
the biggest gain since Oct. 25, to 0.504 percent at the 4:30
p.m. close in Tel Aviv. The two-year break-even rate, the yield
difference between the inflation-linked bond and fixed-rate
government bonds of similar maturity, dropped one basis point to
222, implying an average annual inflation rate of 2.17 percent.
The rate fell 16 basis points this week.  Inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent in September, less
than forecast, from 1.9 percent the previous month, the  Central
Bureau of Statistics  reported Oct. 15. Consumer prices will
probably rise 2 percent in the next 12 months, according to a
 Bank of Israel  survey on Oct. 17, compared with 2.6 percent in
September. October figures are scheduled to be released Nov. 15.  “Inflation expectations are falling on expectations that
economic growth will slow and as commodity prices are
declining,” said Alex Zabezhinsky, chief economist at DS
Securities & Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “In this
environment, investors are selling consumer price-linked bonds
and are preferring non-linked government bonds.”  Slowing Growth  The yield on the 5.5 percent benchmark Mimshal Shiklit
bonds due January 2022 was unchanged at 3.92 percent. The rate
is down six basis points this month. The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index,
which measures inflation-linked and fixed-rate corporate bonds,
declined 0.1 percent to 278.25.  The Bank of Israel last month cut its benchmark  interest
rate  to a 22-month low to spur the economy as global growth
slows. Exports make up about 40 percent of Israeli gross
domestic product.  Economic growth is set to fall to 3.5 percent this year,
from 4.6 percent last year, according to forecasts of the
Central Bureau of Statistics. The government reduced the price
of gasoline for November by 4.5 percent.  The shekel gained for a second time this week,
strengthening 0.1 percent to 3.8956 a dollar at 4:59 p.m.  One-
year interest rate swaps , an indicator of investor expectations
for rates over the period, increased two basis points to 1.91
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
