A London arbitration body will rule
in April on two Lithuanian companiesâ€™ claim against the Serbian
government over a privatization deal that collapsed in 2009,
Baltic News Service reported.  UAB Arvi & Co. and Sanitex UAB, which bought Serbian
fertilizer maker HIP Azotara from the state in 2006, are seeking
damages of 50 million euros ($63.7 million) for what they say
was a political decision by the government to take back
ownership of the factory, BNS said.  The  International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes  has agreed to hear the case and plans to issue a
decision on April 21, Arvi & Co. Chairman Vidmantas Kucinskas
said, according to the newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
