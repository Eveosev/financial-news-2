Zhang Dejiang , who replaced Bo Xilai
as the Communist Party Chief of Chongqing, said he’s unaware of
when the ousted former member of the nation’s Politburo may be
placed on trial.  Speaking at a meeting held as part of the 18th Communist
Party Congress, Zhang also said he wasn’t aware of any evidence
showing British businessman Neil Heywood was a spy. Bo’s wife,
Gu Kailai, was convicted of murdering Heywood in August and Bo
was accused of having “major responsibility” in the killing
when he was expelled from the Communist Party in September.  The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Heywood had
knowingly provided information to a British intelligence officer
about the Bo family. Bo’s wife admitted to having dripped
cyanide into Heywood’s mouth as he lay drunk in a hotel room
after they’d had a falling out and because she thought he was a
threat to her son’s safety, according to the official Xinhua
News Agency.  More than 2,000 Communist Party delegates are attending the
congress, scheduled to run Nov. 8-14 in Beijing, at which
 China ’s next generation of leaders will be appointed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
