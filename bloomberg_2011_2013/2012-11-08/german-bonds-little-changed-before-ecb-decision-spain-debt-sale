Germany’s two-year note yields was
negative for a fourth day before the  European Central Bank 
decides on  interest rates  and  Spain  sells as much as 4.5 billion
euros ($5.75 billion) of securities.  Benchmark  10-year yields  were about two basis points from
lowest in nine weeks after German exports fell more than
economists forecast in September. ECB President  Mario Draghi  and
his colleagues will keep the refinancing rate at a record-low
0.75 percent, according to all but one of 63 economists in a
 Bloomberg News  survey. Greece’s coalition government yesterday
approved new austerity measures needed to release the latest
tranche of bailout funds.  “The market consensus is that the ECB will keep rates on
hold, but I would not be surprised if they cut today,” said
Charles Berry, a government bond trader at Landesbank Baden
Wuerttemberg in Stuttgart. “Judging from recent comments from
Draghi, I think he is preparing the market for lower rates. The
impact of the crisis is hitting core countries like Germany.
Core bond yields are likely to stay low.”  Germany ’s two-year  yield  was at minus 0.032 percent at
9:08 a.m. London time after falling to minus 0.055 percent
yesterday, the least since Aug. 13. The zero percent note due in
September 2014 was at 100.055. A negative yield means investors
who hold the security until it matures will receive less than
they paid to buy it.  The 10-year bund yielded 1.38 percent after sliding to 1.36
percent yesterday, the lowest since Sept. 3.  ‘Very Low’  Draghi will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. in
 Frankfurt  to discuss the rate decision. Inflation risks are
“very low” and the debt crisis is starting to hurt Germany, he
said at a conference yesterday.  Spain is scheduled to sell debt maturing between 2015 and
2032 today. That will be the first auction of 20-year bonds
since October 2010, when it sold 941 million euros of the
securities at an average yield of 4.777 percent.  The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds was little changed at
5.69 percent, and that on its 20-year security was also little
changed at 6.36 percent.  “The auction will go OK,” said  Huw Worthington , a fixed-
income strategist at Barclays Plc in London. “Spain is reacting
to specific market demand with the longer-end sale and so it
will be fine.”  Germany’s  exports , adjusted for work days and seasonal
changes, fell 2.5 percent from August, when they gained 2.3
percent, the Federal Statistics Office said. Economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News forecast a decline of 1.5 percent.  German bonds returned 3.9 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spain’s
bonds rose 2.8 percent, according to the gauges.  To contact the reporters on this story:
