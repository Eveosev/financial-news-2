Sweet and sour oil grades in West
 Texas  sank to six-month lows as output growth outpaces new
pipelines and as refiners and producers try to reduce
inventories to pay less tax.  Texas oil  production  increased 35 percent to an average of
2 million barrels a day in August from a year earlier, Energy
Department data show. Output was boosted to the highest level
since June 1988 by drilling techniques that have helped develop
new shale plays such as the Eagle Ford in southern Texas and
older fields in the western part of the state.  West Texas Intermediate oil delivered in Midland, Texas,
sank 35 cents to $7 a barrel below the same grade in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , which is the benchmark U.S. oil price, at 3:56 p.m. in
 New York . The discount for West Texas Sour versus WTI in Cushing
widened 60 cents to $7.60 a barrel, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Those are the largest discounts for the grades
since April 25.  “People are trying to move as much oil as they can out of
Texas but pipelines are full because of increasing production,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston. Regional refinery maintenance is also helping reduce
demand for the grades, Lipow said.  WTI in Midland averaged a 75 cent discount during the past
five years, and WTS averaged $2.75 below the benchmark.  Companies in Texas can be taxed on the value of stored
crude as part of local property taxes, R.J. DeSilva, an Austin-
based spokesman for the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts,
said in an e-mail.  Gulf Coast  On the  Gulf Coast , Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI
narrowed 50 cents to $20.50 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet fell
50 cents to $20 a barrel over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium widened 10 cents to $14.50. Mars Blend
slipped 20 cents to $14.40 a barrel over WTI, and Southern Green
Canyon gained 55 cents to a $14.90 premium.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
was narrowed 75 cents to $19.50 above WTI.  Western Canada Select’s discount widened 50 cents to $30
below the U.S. benchmark. Syncrude, a Canadian light synthetic
oil processed from  oil sands , gained 25 cents to a $7 a barrel
discount. Bakken crude delivered in Clearbrook,  Minnesota ,
increased $1.25 to an $8 discount.  To contact the reporter on this story:
