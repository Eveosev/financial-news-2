percent of sales in the U.S., lost 3.5 percent in Hong Kong.

as of 6:22 p.m. in Tokyo, the biggest slide since Sept. 26, with
all 10 industry groups retreating. The gauge gained 13 percent
through yesterday from this year’s low on June 4 as central
banks added stimulus amid a slowdown in global economic growth
and the European debt crisis.  “Investors are taking a step back and thinking the fiscal

declines as Australian employers boosted payrolls more than
forecast last month.  New Zealand ’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.3 percent
in Wellington after a report that unemployment rose to a 13-year
high fueled speculation the  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand will
lower rates next month to revive demand.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2
percent today. U.S. stocks slumped yesterday, with the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  posting its biggest decline in a year, as
investors focused on the $607 billion of tax increases and
federal spending cuts set to kick in automatically in January,
the so-called fiscal cliff. The Congressional Budget Office has
said the  U.S. economy  will contract by as much as 0.5 percent

carmaker that gets about 44 percent of sales from North America,
dropped 3.5 percent to 2,395 yen in Tokyo.  Europe Growth  Companies that do business in Europe slid after the
European Commission cut its growth forecast for the  euro zone  as
the debt crisis ravages southern Europe and gnaws at the
economic performance of export-driven Germany. The 17-nation
euro economy will expand 0.1 percent in 2013, down from a May

gets 55 percent of sales in Europe, declined 2.8 percent to

through yesterday pushed up valuations on the measure to 13.5
times average estimated earnings, compared with 13.4 for the S&P
500 and 12.2 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Komatsu, Galaxy  Komatsu, the world’s second-biggest maker of construction
and mining equipment, lost 2.2 percent to 1,720 yen. Japan

six months, declined 4.3 percent in September from the previous
month, the Cabinet Office said today in Tokyo. The median of 29
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 2.1 percent drop.  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  fell 4.4 percent to

its remaining holdings in the casino operator through a private
placement.  NCsoft Corp. tumbled 13 percent to 185,500 won in Seoul,
the most on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, after the South Korean

analyst estimates. Hyundai Securities Co. and Woori Investment &
Securities Co. lowered their share-price forecasts.  Among stocks that advanced,  Lynas Corp. (LYC)  jumped 12 percent
to 80.5 Australian cents after a Malaysian court ruled in favor

refinery in that country. The court denied an application by
parties associated with Save Malaysia Stop Lynas group for an
injunction against Lynas’ temporary operating license.  To contact the reporters on this story:
