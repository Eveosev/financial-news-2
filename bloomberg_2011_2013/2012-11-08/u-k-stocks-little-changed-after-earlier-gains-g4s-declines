U.K. stocks were little changed,
erasing earlier gains, as Greek lawmakers approved a
package of austerity measures necessary to win the next slice of
European Union aid.  G4S Plc (GFS)  declined the most in two months after losing a U.K.
prison contract.  Balfour Beatty Plc (BBY)  sank the most in 14 years as
the U.K.’s largest construction company said the outlook for
profit margins has faded because of a lack of building work in
Britain.  BTG Plc (BTG)  jumped 8.1 percent after the drugmaker reported
an increase in first-half earnings and revenue.  Burberry Group
Plc (BRBY)  climbed 1.8 percent.  The FTSE 100 Index fell 7.72 points, or 0.1 percent, to
5,783.91 at 3:29 p.m. in London, after earlier climbing as much
as 0.6 percent. The gauge fell 1.6 percent yesterday as the
European Commission cut its euro-area growth forecast and
concern over an impending U.S. fiscal crisis overshadowed the
re-election of President Barack Obama. The FTSE All-Share Index
dropped 0.1 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ fell 0.7
percent.  “Equities posted a small bounce on the open but this has
quickly fizzled out as traders remain relatively bearish,”
 Manoj Ladwa , the head of trading at TJ Markets in London, wrote
in an e-mail. “The raft of corporate earnings this morning has
done little to lift confidence amongst traders. Now the U.S.
election is out of the way, the euro zone seems to be coming
back to the forefront with all eyes on Spain.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
