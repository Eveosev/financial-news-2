Foschini Ltd., a South African
clothing and household goods retailer with nearly 2,000 stores,
said it plans to open its first stores in Mozambique and  Ghana 
as it accelerates an expansion drive outside its home market.  Foschini operated 1,920 stores at the end of September, of
which 62 were in Namibia, 16 in Botswana, 12 in Zambia, two in
 Lesotho , four in Swaziland and two in Nigeria. It intends to
open another 56 stores in those countries over the next two
years to boost growth.  “Expansion into the rest of  Africa  is a longer-term growth
strategy,” the Cape Town-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today. “By the 2015 financial year, the Foschini
Group will be trading out of in excess of 150 stores in Africa”
with expected sales of more than 1 billion rand ($114.9
million).  Foschini is following the example of other South African
retailers such as  Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP)  and  Massmart Holdings
Ltd. (MSM)  in expanding across Africa to tap rising consumer spending.  Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, offers the greatest
opportunity for expansion, said Ronnie Steyn, Foschini’s chief
financial officer.  “Nigeria has up to 100 shopping centers in the planning
stage,” he said by phone from Cape Town. “We have got 15
brands. We can have 400 stores there quite comfortably.”  More Customers  Foschini’s net income rose 19 percent to 834.7 million
rand, or 3.96 rand a share, in the six months through September,
from 699 million rand, or 3.33 rand, a year earlier, the
retailer said today in a stock exchange filing. Sales rose 14
percent to 7.7 billion rand, with stores outside  South Africa 
generating about 670 million rand.  Steyn attributed the increased profit to Foschini winning
more customers, cutting costs and improving its buying.  The shares rose 2.65 rand, or 2.1 percent, to 129.66 rand
at 3:37 p.m. in Johannesburg, giving the company a market value
of 31.2 billion rand.  Truworths International Ltd. (TRU) , another South African
clothing retailer, today said revenue for the 18 weeks through
Nov. 4 rose 16 percent to 3.3 billion rand. Sales at stores open
for at least a year, rose 10.7 percent while prices increased by
an average 3 percent, the Cape Town-based retailer said in a
stock exchange filing.  Truworths shares rose 2.11 rand, or 2.1 percent, to 98.98
rand in Johannesburg, giving it a market value of 45.7 billion
rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
