Middle-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s biggest oil-trading and storage center, rose
21 percent during the past week, the most in 1 1/2 years,
according to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including gasoil, or diesel, and
kerosene rose 2 million barrels to 11.3 million in the seven
days to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said today
in an e-mailed statement. That’s the largest percentage increase
since the week ended May 4, 2011.  Light-distillate supplies including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate gained 33,000 barrels, or 0.4 percent, to 9.21
million, the ministry’s data showed. That’s the highest in three
weeks.  Stockpiles of  residual fuels  including  fuel oil  and low-
sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen rebounded 449,000
barrels, or 2.2 percent, to 20.9 million, according to the data.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
