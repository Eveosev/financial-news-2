Russian stocks  fell to the lowest
level in three months as OAO Sberbank, the nation’s largest
lender, slumped and U.S. elections set up a showdown over the
nation’s budget deficit.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  fell 1.1 percent to 1,407.79 by the close
in Moscow, the weakest since Aug. 2.  Consumer and banking  stocks
led the decline as Sberbank, which has the  third-largest 
weighting on the index, sank 4.1 percent. OAO Mosenergo, a
utility, tumbled 4.7 percent.  Barack Obama , who was re-elected president yesterday, now
faces negotiations to avoid more than $600 billion of automatic
tax increases and spending cuts, while anti-austerity protests
in  Greece  and weaker economic data in  Asia  added to concern
global growth may slow, pushing investors to sell riskier
stocks. Sberbank reported operating expenses rose 22 percent in
the first 10 months of the year.  “Russian investors are concerned the debate between Obama
and the Congress will extend and this may pressure the  oil
prices , which would be very negative for  Russia ,” Sergey Fundobny, head of research at Arbat Capital Management in
Moscow, said by phone.  The number of shares traded in the Micex gauge was 5.6
percent higher than the daily average of the past 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Implied Volatility  Oil rebounded from the lowest level in almost four months,
adding 0.3 percent to $84.73 per barrel in  New York . Russia
receives about 50 percent of budget revenue from oil and gas
sales. Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities gained 0.1
percent to 629.61. The Russia Depositary Index fell 2.1 percent
to 1,576.56.  While Obama received at least 303 electoral votes to
Republican Challenger  Mitt Romney ’s 206, Republicans kept a
majority in the  House of Representatives . Democrats retained
control of the Senate.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, fell 2.9 percent to $27.56
yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in futures, rose 13 percent to 30 points.  Options traders demanded more protection against
fluctuations in Russian stocks over the next six months.  Implied volatility, the key gauge of options prices, for
at-the-money contracts on the Market Vectors Russia exchange-
traded fund due in six months rose to 29.94 yesterday, and was
26 percent above the level for those expiring in 30 days on Nov.
2, the biggest gap since December 2010, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Oil Stocks  OAO Gazprom Neft rose 1.1 percent to 153.01 rubles, the
biggest jump in a week. The amount of shares traded was equal to
about half of the average three-month volume, according to
Bloomberg data.  The oil arm of Russia’s natural-gas exporter increased
profit 24 percent in the third quarter after output gained. Net
income advanced to 56 billion rubles ($1.8 billion) from 45.3
billion rubles a year earlier, the  St. Petersburg , Russia-based
company said on its website. That beat the average estimate of
49.3 billion rubles from five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Citigroup Inc. raised Russia’s oil sector to overweight in
an e-mailed note today, citing the possibility that OAO
Rosneft’s acquisition of TNK-BP will trigger a “more
favorable” greenfield oil tax regime.  Citigroup prefers Rosneft and OAO Surgutneftegas’s
preferred shares among Russia oil stocks, according to the note.
Rosneft fell 1.9 percent to 240.50 rubles, the biggest drop
since Oct. 19. Surgutneftegas’s preferred shares rose 1.3
percent to 20.004 rubles.  The Micex trades at 5.4 times  estimated earnings  after
gaining 0.4 percent this year. That compares with a multiple of
10.2 times for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index, which has added
8.7 percent.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
