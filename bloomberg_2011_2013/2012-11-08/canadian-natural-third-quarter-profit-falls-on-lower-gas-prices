(Corrects gas volumes in the fourth paragraph.)  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the
nation’s third-largest oil and natural-gas producer, said
quarterly profit declined 57 percent as fossil fuel prices fell.
The shares dropped the most in more than four months.  Net income dropped to C$360 million ($360.9 million), or 33
cents a share, in the third quarter from C$836 million, or 76
cents, a year earlier, the Calgary-based company said today in a
statement. Excluding a gain from derivatives contracts and other
one-time items, per-share profit was 18 cents less than the 50-
cent average of 18  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales rose 7 percent to $3.53 billion.  The “disappointing” results “were largely due to lower
realized pricing for North American liquids production,”  Randy Ollenberger , an analyst at BMO Capital Markets Ltd. in Calgary,
said in a note today.  Canadian Natural is among producers that have cut spending
and shut gas wells after prices in New York dropped to a 10-year
low in April. Gas production fell 5 percent to 1.3 billion cubic
feet a day from the year earlier after the company shut in 40
million cubic feet a day because of low prices, according to the
statement.  Gas prices averaged $2.893 per million British thermal
units on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  in the quarter, down
29 percent from a year earlier.  Lower Budget  The company lowered its  capital budget  for 2012 by 10
percent to C$6.7 billion in August, and reduced annual spending
by an additional C$230 million in the quarter, it said in the
statement.  Canadian Natural produced the equivalent of 667,616 barrels
of oil a day in the quarter, an increase of 9 percent from a
year earlier. It cut the mid-point of its full-year production
guidance by 1 percent, lowering estimated production for 2012
from its Horizon upgrader in Alberta to 87,000 to 89,000 barrels
a day.  The company will proceed with the 50,000 barrel a day North
West Redwater upgrader and refinery, which will reduce its
reliance on heavy crude  oil prices ,  Steve Laut , Canadian
Natural’s president, said in the release. Construction of the
C$5.7 billion facility is expected to begin in 2013.  Canadian Natural fell 3.6 percent to C$28.02 at the close
in Toronto. Earlier it declined 5.2 percent, the most intraday
since June 21. The shares have fallen 27 percent this year.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  and  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO)  are the largest
Canadian crude companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
