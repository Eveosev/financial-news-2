Novartis AG (NOVN)  said sales of its Tasigna
leukemia drug will benefit as patients are able to stop taking
it after it has healed them in what the company calls a “path
to cure.”  The company is betting on new findings showing that
patients who have very little traces of leukemia in their blood
can safely stop taking treatments such as Tasigna or Novartis’s
best-selling Gleevec cancer drug.  Compared to Gleevec, new clinical data shows that Tasigna
more effectively clears patients’ blood, according to a
 presentation  on the company’s website today. These findings will
convince more patients to switch from its best-selling drug
Gleevec, and will increase the share of new patients taking
Tasigna, leading to a “net positive,” according to the slides.  To contact the reporter on this story:
