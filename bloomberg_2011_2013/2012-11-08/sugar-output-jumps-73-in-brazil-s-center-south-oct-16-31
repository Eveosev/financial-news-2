Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, climbed 73 percent
in the second half of October after dry weather allowed growers
to speed up harvesting, industry association Unica said.  Mills produced 2.55 million metric tons of the sweetener
between Oct. 16 and Oct. 31, up from 1.48 million tons a year
earlier, Sao Paulo-based Unica said in an e-mailed  report  today.  Sugarcane growers harvested 36.2 million tons in the
period, up from 23.1 million tons a year earlier. Ethanol output
increased 55 percent to 1.5 billion liters (396 million
gallons).  Center South millers, which produce about 90 percent of
Brazil’s sugar, turned 51.2 percent of the cane into sweetener,
compared with 48.4 percent a year earlier. The rest was
processed into ethanol.  The region will harvest 518.5 million tons of cane in the
crop year that started April 1, Unica said Sept. 20. That
compares with 493.2 million tons in the past season. Sugar
output is forecast to climb to 32.7 million tons, from 31.3
million tons in the past season, the association said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
