McGraw Hill Cos. (MHP) ’  Standard & Poor’s 
unit must face a lawsuit by Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan accusing the company of a “fraudulent role’” in
assigning improperly high ratings to mortgage-backed securities.  Cook County Circuit Court Judge Mary Anne Mason today
denied McGraw Hill and S&P’s request to dismiss the case. The
judge rejected all of the company’s arguments that Illinois had
no legal basis for its lawsuit, including the argument that its
rating opinions are protected by the U.S. Constitution’s
guarantee of freedom of expression.  “While even purely ‘commercial’ speech is entitled to a
limited degree of First Amendment protection, courts have long
held that neither the federal nor state constitutions protects
false, misleading or deceptive commercial speech,” Mason said
in her order.  Madigan, in her complaint filed in January, said the
ratings service put profit first, while purporting to provide
independent, objective analyses. In one 2007 online exchange
among S&P workers, an employee said an investment “could be
structured by cows and we would rate it,” according to a
statement Madigan issued when the complaint was filed.  “Notwithstanding this recent ruling, we continue to
believe the case is without merit and will continue to
vigorously defend ourselves,”  Ed Sweeney , a spokesman for S&P
in New York, said in an e-mail.  The case is Illinois v. The McGraw-Hill Cos. and Standard &
Poor’s, 12CH02535, Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois,
County Department,  Chancery Division  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
