Banco do Brasil SA ,  Latin America ’s
largest lender by assets, said its third-quarter profit rose 3.3
percent, matching analysts’ estimates as lending expanded at a
faster pace.  Adjusted net income, which excludes one-time charges,
advanced to 2.69 billion reais ($1.32 billion) from 2.57 billion
reais a year earlier, the Brasilia-based company said today in a
filing. That was in line with the average estimate of 2.69
billion reais in a Bloomberg  survey  of nine analysts.  Banco do Brasil, led by Chief Executive Officer Aldemir Bendine, 48, increased its loan book to 532.3 billion reais in
the third quarter, up 21 percent from a year earlier. The bank
increased its share of  Brazil ’s credit market to 19.6 percent at
the end of September from 19.5 percent in June and 19.3 percent
a year earlier, according to the statement. It maintained its
2012 forecast for lending growth of 17 percent to 21 percent.  Federally controlled banks Banco do Brasil and Caixa
Economica Federal have been boosting lending and reducing
borrowing costs after President  Dilma Rousseff  urged lenders to
cut profits to “civilized” levels. Non-government banks’
outstanding loans grew 7 percent in the 12 months through
September, compared with almost 26 percent for state-controlled
lenders, according to the central bank.  Banco do Brasil  dropped  5.3 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with a 10 percent decline for  Itau Unibanco
Holding SA. (ITUB4)   To contact the reporter on this story:
