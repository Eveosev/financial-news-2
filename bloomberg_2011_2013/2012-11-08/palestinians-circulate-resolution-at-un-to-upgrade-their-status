Palestinians initiated a second
statehood bid at the United Nations, overriding U.S. objections
in an effort to raise their profile at the world body.  The Palestinian Authority today circulated a resolution
that would upgrade the Palestine Liberation Organization’s
status to that of a “non-member state” on par with the  Holy See ,
according to a draft that will be put to a vote in the UN’s 193-
member General Assembly. The initiative comes a year after the
Palestinians’ failed effort to obtain full membership through
the Security Council, a step the Obama administration blocked.  Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas  will present
the text in person in New York, according to a UN official
speaking on condition of anonymity. A vote is expected to take
place by the end of the month, the official said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
