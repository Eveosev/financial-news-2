The  French Senate  delivered a
symbolic rebuke to President  Francois Hollande , with Communist
lawmakers refusing to support his five-year budgetary plan they
called too austere.  Communist senators joined former President Nicolas
Sarkozy’s  Union for a Popular Movement  opposition party to vote
against the law late yesterday. The count was 189 votes against
and 152 in favor.  The bill returns to the lower house early next month where
it will probably pass. Under French law the National Assembly’s
final vote is enough to pass a bill. Hollande’s Socialist Party
has an absolute majority in the chamber. Yesterday’s vote marked
the second time in less than a month that Communists rebuffed a
government bill. They have also criticized the 2013 social-
security budget bill to be voted next week.  The Senate may also rebuff the 2013 budget law. Hollande’s
2013 blueprint relies on 20 billion euros ($26 billion) in tax
increases, including a levy of 75 percent on incomes over 1
million euros, and eliminating limits on the  wealth tax .
Hollande aims to reduce spending by 10 billion euros, bringing
the deficit to 3 percent of output from 4.5 percent in 2012. The
budget predicts growth of 0.8 percent.  “I can see now that (Communist lawmakers) are not in the
government’s majority,” Bruno Le Roux, the Socialist Party whip
at the National Assembly told France 2 television today. “It’s
a serious matter to vote against the budget,” he added.  Socialists have 127 of the Senate’s 347 seats. Former
President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s Union for a Majority party (UMP)
holds 131 seats. Communist and affiliates have 20 senators and
the Green party has 12. The minority centrist parties have 30
senators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
