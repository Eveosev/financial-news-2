The biggest group in the European
Parliament called on the European Union’s regulator today to
postpone by five months a proposal to curb oversupply of permits
in the bloc’s cap-and-trade carbon market.  The European Commission said it won’t delay the draft
measure, which is intended to help carbon prices recover from a
record low earlier this year. It will be presented next week as
planned, Isaac Valero-Ladron, the climate spokesman for the EU’s
regulatory arm, said by phone today.  The European People’s Party urged the commission to delay
the presentation of the so-called backloading measure, scheduled
for Nov. 14, until the bloc’s assembly reasserts the regulator’s
right to fix the market by delaying some auctions of carbon
permits in 2013. The parliament is due to vote on a change to
the EU emissions law to clarify the commission’s powers in
April.  “A balanced and responsible handling of this file is of
the utmost importance,” EPP said in a letter sent to EU Climate
Commissioner Connie Hedegaard and Commission President Jose
Barroso, according to the group’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
