Research Affiliates LLC and
 WisdomTree Investments Inc. (WETF)  said they’ve resolved patent-
infringement claims and counterclaims brought against each other
in federal court in  Santa Ana , California, and agreed not to
renew the litigation in the near future.  As part of the settlement, Research Affiliates of  Newport
Beach , California, will make a one-time payment of $700,000 to
WidsomTree, the companies said in a statement today.  “Based on information that came to our attention during
the lawsuit, Research Affiliates can now acknowledge that
WisdomTree’s fundamentally weighted indexes and strategies were
developed by WisdomTree independently of Research Affiliates,”
Robert Arnott, chief executive officer of Research Affiliates,
said in the statement.  “We are pleased the matter is resolved and our businesses
will continue as usual” Jonathan Steinberg, chief executive
officer of New York-based WisdomTree, said in the statement.  Research Affiliates and WisdomTree are investment
management firms. One of the key documents in the case was
Research Affiliates’ 2010 patent for “Using Accounting Data
Based Indexing to Create a Portfolio of Assets,” according to
court filings.  The case is Research Affiliates v. WisdomTree, 11-cv-1846,
U.S. District Court, Central District of  California  (Santa Ana).  To contact the reporter on this story:
