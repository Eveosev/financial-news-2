each league are the Tampa Bay Rays’ David Price, the Tigers’
Justin Verlander and the Angels’ Jered Weaver for the AL.  The NL finalists are R.A. Dickey of the New York Mets, Gio Gonzalez of the Washington Nationals and the Los Angeles
Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw. The winners will be announced Nov. 14.  Rookie of the Year finalists in the AL are Yoenis Cespedes
of the Oakland Athletics, Yu Darvish of the Rangers and Trout.
Todd Frazier of the Cincinnati Reds, Bryce Harper of the
