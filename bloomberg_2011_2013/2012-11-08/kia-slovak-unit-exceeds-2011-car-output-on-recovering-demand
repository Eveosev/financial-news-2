The Slovak unit of  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) 
has assembled more cars this year to date than for the whole of
2011, driven by rising demand for new models.  The Seoul-based carmaker produced more than 253,000 cars in
its Slovak factory near Zilina, compared with 252,000 vehicles
last year, the company said in an e-mailed statement. In October
alone, output rose 35 percent to more than 30,000 vehicles.  Kia and its affiliate Hyundai Motors Co. are weathering the
economic slowdown in western  Europe , where sales of all new cars
slumped 11 percent in September from the previous year. Kia’s
total European sales rose 4.9 percent from a year earlier in
that month.  The carmaker, which makes Venga subcompact models in Zilina
as well as Sportage sport-utility vehicles, also said it’s so
far meeting its full-year target of assembling 285,000 vehicles
at the plant this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
