Fluor Corp. (FLR) , the largest publicly
traded U.S. engineering and construction company, is accused of
using funds from an Energy Department contract to pay for
lobbying activities that sought more federal money, according to
court papers filed by the U.S. Justice Department.  The department announced today that it is joining a false
claims lawsuit in federal court in Spokane, Washington, alleging
that Fluor Corp. and Fluor Hanford Inc. paid two lobbying
companies more than $650,000 with money meant to train emergency
personnel at the Energy Department’s Hanford nuclear site.  “The taxpayer money Congress allocated for this program
was for training federal emergency response personnel and first
responders, not to lobby Congress and others for more funding,”
Stuart F. Delery, acting head of the Justice Department’s Civil
Division, said in an e-mailed statement.  The lawsuit was originally filed by whistle-blower Loydene
Rambo, a former employee of Fluor.  Keith Stephens, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Fluor,
said in an e-mailed statement that the company is aware of the
Justice Department action and denies the allegations.  Last year, the company paid $4 million to settle U.S.
allegations that it knowingly submitted false claims and paid
and received kickbacks involving an Energy Department contract
at the same nuclear site.  The case is U.S. ex rel. Rambo v. Fluor Hanford LLC, 11-
cv-05037, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of  Washington 
(Spokane).  To contact the reporter on this story:
