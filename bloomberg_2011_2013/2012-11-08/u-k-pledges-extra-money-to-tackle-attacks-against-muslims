U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg 
pledged an extra 214,000 pounds ($342,000) of government money
to help combat what he called “vile attacks” against Muslims.  The grant will allow the Monitoring Anti-Muslim Attacks
project to continue for another year, providing data and reports
on attacks on Muslims and their neighborhoods and giving support
to victims, his office said in a statement. The group says it
will focus on examining crime data and the media’s role in
reporting them.  “Prejudice, religious hatred, racially motivated violence
-- there is no place for hate crimes in 21st-century Britain,”
Clegg said today at a Town Hall event in Manchester, northern
 England . “I cannot be clearer -- the government will do
everything in its power to stamp out vile attacks motivated
purely by hatred of one religion or another.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
