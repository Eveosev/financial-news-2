Colombia ’s exports rose 6.1 percent
to $4.8 billion in September compared with the same month last
year, the government statistics agency said today in a report on
its website.  In the same period a month earlier, exports fell 7.6
percent in August from the same month last year.  The central bank cited weak demand for Colombia’s exports
in its decision to cut interest rates a quarter point at both
its July and August meetings. Policy makers left the benchmark
interest rate unchanged at 4.75 percent for a second straight
month in October, saying that bond-buying plans by the U.S.
Federal Reserve and  European Central Bank  will ease the risk of
a global slump.  The peso has gained 7 percent this year, the third biggest
gain among 25 emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
