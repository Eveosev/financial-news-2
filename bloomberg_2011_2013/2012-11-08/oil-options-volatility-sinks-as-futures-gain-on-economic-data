Crude oil options volatility fell as
futures advanced after U.S. jobs and trade data showed gains
amid indications  China’s economy  may be strengthening.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 31.26 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange as of 3:55 p.m., down from 31.37 percent
yesterday.  January-delivery crude oil rose 65 cents to settle at
$85.56 a barrel on the Nymex.  The U.S.  trade deficit  narrowed in September on record
exports. Applications for jobless benefits fell by 8,000 to
355,000 last week, according to the Labor Department.  China ’s central bank governor and statistics chief signaled
October data will show growth improving this quarter in the
world’s second-largest economy.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
December $80 puts, which fell 19 cents to 13 cents a barrel on
volume of 5,276 lots at 3:59 p.m. February $115 calls were the
second-most active, with 2,715 lots exchanged as they increased
3 cents to 19 cents.  Bets that prices would rise, or calls, accounted for 54
percent of the 59,701 lots traded.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets made up 55 percent of
