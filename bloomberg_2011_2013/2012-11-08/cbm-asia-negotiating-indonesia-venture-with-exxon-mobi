CBM Asia Development Corp. (TCF)  is
negotiating a possible joint venture with  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  on
three coalbed-methane production-sharing contracts in Indonesia.  CBM Asia said it will acquire a 35 percent to 37.5 percent
stake in three existing production-sharing contracts, according
to a statement today. It didn’t give a value for the proposed
transaction.  The company, based in  Vancouver , will have the right to
acquire an additional 35 percent stake, according to the
statement. It will also acquire the right to farm into 50
percent of Exxon Mobil’s future participating interest in
certain coalbed-methane projects.  Patrick McGinn, an Exxon Mobil spokesman, declined to
comment, citing company policy on commercial discussions.  CBM Asia was unchanged at 16 cents at 9:30 a.m. in Toronto.
Exxon Mobil fell 5 cents to $88.13 in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
