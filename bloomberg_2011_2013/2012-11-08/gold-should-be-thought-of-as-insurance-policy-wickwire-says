Investors should look at gold as an
insurance policy for other financial assets, Joseph Wickwire,
who manages $4.5 billion at  Fidelity Investments , said today at
the Bloomberg Portfolio Manager conference in  New York .  Macroeconomic imbalances, reflationary policies and
geopolitical tensions will drive prices higher in the long term,
Wickwire said. Investors with risk-tolerant portfolios should
hold the metal to hedge against volatility in other markets, he
said.  “Gold pays off when stocks, bonds and currencies
disappoint,” Wickwire said. “A little goes a long way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
