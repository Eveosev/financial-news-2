Spanish bonds fell, pushing yields to
the highest in four weeks, after the nation sold 4.76 billion
euros ($6.06 billion) of debt amid speculation its chances of
seeking a bailout have receded.  Spain’s securities slid for a second day as European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said at a policy meeting
that risks to the region’s economic growth were on the downside.
Italian bonds also dropped as Market News International said the
ECB was reluctant to start buying government debt. German  two-
year yields  were below zero for a fourth day and Belgian 10-year
yields declined to a record as investors sought safer assets.  “Spanish yields are rising partly because of new supply
today and growing speculation in the market that Spain may not
apply for the ECB’s aid program any time soon,” said Jamie Searle, a fixed-income strategist at Citigroup Inc. in  London .
“Those who bought peripheral bonds in anticipation of this may
be lightening up on their positions a bit.”  Spain ’s 10-year yield rose 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 5.85 percent at 4:57 p.m. London time, the
highest since Oct. 11. The 5.85 percent bond due in January 2022
fell 1.11, or 11.10 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.965.  There’s an increasingly widespread view Spain can put off a
decision on whether to ask for aid until 2013, with the
country’s next bond redemptions not due until January, Market
News said, citing European Union officials it didn’t name.  Italy’s 10-year yield climbed 11 basis points to 5.02
percent.  Spanish Spread  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield was two basis points lower at
1.36 percent, after falling to 1.35 percent, the least since
Sept. 3. The two-year rate was at minus 0.033 percent.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Spain’s 10-year
bonds instead of German bunds reached a four-week high. The
spread widened as much as 19 basis points to 450 basis points,
the most since Oct. 9.  “The market expectations of Spain asking for a bailout
have been cooling off,” said Pablo Zaragoza, head of interest-
rate strategy for  Europe  and the U.S. at  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA (BBVA)  in  Madrid . “There is a high probability of Spain
asking for aid sooner rather than later, probably in the next
two- to three months, and that would initially have a positive
action on the bonds.”  The Treasury in Madrid sold three-year notes at an average
yield of 3.66 percent, compared with 3.956 percent at an auction
last month, and a new five-year benchmark bond at 4.68 percent.  It allotted 731 million euros of bonds maturing in 2032 at
an average yield of 6.328 percent, compared with 4.777 percent
when they were last sold in October 2010.  Sales Completed  The Treasury said it has completed its program of medium-
and long-term debt sales for 2012 and will use the auctions
scheduled for the rest of the year to raise funds for 2013.  “Economic activity in the euro area is expected to remain
weak” and underlying inflation pressures “should remain
moderate,” Draghi said at a press conference in  Frankfurt .
Policy makers are “ready to undertake” purchases of  government
bonds , or so-called Outright Monetary Transactions, “which will
help to avoid extreme scenarios,” Draghi said.  Greek bonds fell for a second day as German Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said a meeting of euro-region
finance ministers next week may fail to take a decision on
unlocking a 31.5 billion-euro aid tranche for  Greece  that’s been
frozen since June. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras won
parliamentary approval for his austerity package early today in
 Athens .  Schaeuble Comments  “We’re not out of the woods yet,” Schaeuble said at a
panel discussion in Hamburg today with former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. “At the moment, I don’t see how we can take the
decision already next week.”  The yield on Greece’s 2 percent bond due February 2023
climbed 72 basis points to 18.07 percent, leaving the price at
30.62 percent of face value.  Belgian yields declined after the nation’s debt agency said
bank-financing costs won’t require more bond sales this year.
The 10-year rate fell as much as three basis points to 2.32
percent, a record low, before settling at 2.34 percent.  German bonds returned 3.9 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spain’s
bonds rose 2.8 percent and Belgian securities handed investors a
return of 14 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
