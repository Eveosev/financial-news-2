HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) , the world’s
third-largest maker of cement, saved more than it expected from
a cost-cutting program and cut debt by almost 10 percent in the
quarter.  Net debt fell 740 million euros ($944 million) to 7.76
billion euros, the Heidelberg, Germany-based company said today
in an e-mail. The cement maker also saved 241 million euros,
more than the targeted 200 million euros, by reducing the cash
tied up in day-to-day business and cutting purchasing expenses.
The stock rose the most in two months in Frankfurt trading.  Chief Executive Officer Bernd Scheifele today said he will
find a further 350 million euros in savings by 2015 as he
attempts to counter declining demand for building materials in
parts of  Europe . The company is struggling to overcome a debt
burden, inflated by the 2007 takeover of Hanson for more than
$18 billion.  “Net debt reduction in the third quarter underlines that
we are well on our way to reach our targets for 2012,”
Scheifele said in today’s statement. “However, macroeconomic
risks remain meaningful.”  The shares climbed as much as 1.91 euros, or 4.6 percent,
the biggest jump since Sept. 6, to 43.74 euros. They were
trading up 2.8 percent at 43 euros as of 9:23 a.m. local time.
The stock has gained 31 percent this year for a market value of
8 billion euros.  Third-quarter earnings before interest and taxes,
depreciation and amortization rose 12 percent to 874 million
euros, beating the average estimate for 831.8 million euros in a
Bloomberg survey. Sales rose 9 percent to 3.9 billion euros.  Scheifele stuck to a goal for higher revenue and operating
profit this year, without being more specific.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  yesterday reported an 11 percent rise in third-
quarter profit as it pushed through price increases in  emerging
markets , and said it is considering disposals amid a greater-
than-expected slowdown in Europe.  Lafarge SA (LG)  will report third-
quarter results tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
