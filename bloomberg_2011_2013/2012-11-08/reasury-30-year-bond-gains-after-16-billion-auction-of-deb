Treasury 30-year bond yields fell to
a two-month low as the U.S. received the highest demand this
year at an auction of the debt amid concern lawmakers risk
pushing the economy into recession over a budget showdown.  The  difference  in yields between 10- and 30-year debt
narrowed to the least since August with  demand  for the bonds, as
measured by the number of bids submitted compared with the
amount of debt sold, the highest since December. Treasuries have
risen since the re-election of President  Barack Obama  and a
split Congress on concern they’ll be unable to compromise and
avoid a series of automatic tax increases and spending cuts that
have become known as the fiscal cliff.  “The strong auction reflects strong demand,” said  Priya Misra , head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America Corp. in
 New York , which as one of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary
dealers is obliged to bid in U.S. auctions. “If you are worried
about the fiscal cliff, the place to be is the long end of the
Treasury curve, as the yield there has more room to fall.”  The  yield  on the current 30-year bond dropped eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 2.75 percent at 5 p.m. New
York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It touched
2.74 percent, the lowest level since Sept. 7. The price of the
2.75 percent security maturing in August 2042 rose 1 17/32, or
$15.31 per $1,000 face value, to 99 31/32.  Ten-year note  yields
fell three basis points to 1.62 percent.  Deficit Showdown  The U.S. faces $1.2 trillion in mandated spending cuts and
tax increases starting Jan. 1 if Congress can’t agree to reduce
the deficit, which totaled $1.09 trillion in fiscal 2012. The
 Congressional Budget Office  has said the world’s biggest economy
would slow by as much as 0.5 percent next year if Congress fails
to prevent the measures from kicking in, pushing the economy
over what’s become known as the fiscal cliff.  As Obama was re-elected this week, Republicans maintained
control of the  House of Representatives  and Democrats held on to
a Senate majority.  The 30-year bonds sold today drew a  yield  of 2.82 percent,
compared with a forecast of 2.848 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of nine primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of bonds
offered, was 2.77, versus an average of 2.59 for the past 10
sales.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 45.4 percent of the bonds sold today,
compared with 26.5 percent at the October sale, which was the
lowest level since August 2011, and an average for the past 10
offerings of 32.6 percent.  S&P Odds  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 12.4 percent on
the bonds, versus 14.2 percent at the last sale and an average
of 14.4 percent for the past 10 auctions.  Thirty-year bonds have returned 4.3 percent this year,
compared with a 2.4 percent gain in the broader U.S. Treasuries
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The probability that political wrangling will push the U.S.
over the fiscal cliff has increased to about 15 percent,
 Standard & Poor’s  said today in a report. The rating company
stripped the U.S. of its AAA credit rating on Aug. 5, 2011,
after months of political brinkmanship that pushed the nation to
the deadline an agreement to lift the debt ceiling.  “Our base-case forecast has long been for Congress to
resolve the fiscal cliff after the election and before the end
of the year,” said S&P, which has a negative outlook on the
U.S. credit grade. “Lawmakers will finally come to realize that
they must reach some compromise on tackling the long-term
federal debt, phasing in spending cuts and tax increases over
several years.”  Lower Demand  Today’s auction was the final of three offerings of coupon-
bearing securities by the Treasury this week totaling $72
billion.  The U.S. sold $24 billion of  10-year debt  yesterday at a
yield of 1.675 percent and auctioned $32 billion of three-year
notes on Nov. 6 at a yield of 0.392 percent. Both sales drew
lower demand than at previous offerings.  Investors bid for 2.59 times the amount of securities
available yesterday, versus 3.26 times at the 10-year auction in
October. For the  three-year sale , the figure dropped to 3.41,
from 3.96 a month earlier.  “There is definitely concern out there, given the policy
and economic uncertainties, and even at these low yields
investors are willing to pay up to get the long end,” said
Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim
Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for institutional
investors.  Quantitative Easing  Long-bond yields fell yesterday the most in 11 weeks as
Obama’s re-election also fueled speculation the Fed will keep
buying Treasuries.  The Fed purchased $2.3 trillion of Treasuries and mortgage-
related bonds in two rounds of quantitative-easing stimulus from
2008 to 2011 and has begun a third effort. The central bank
announced Sept. 13 it would buy $40 billion a month of mortgage-
backed securities until the outlook for the labor market
improves “substantially.”  Fewer Americans than forecast filed claims for  unemployment 
insurance last week as the effects of  Hurricane Sandy  started to
show up. Applications for jobless benefits fell by 8,000 to
355,000 in the week ended Nov. 3, the Labor Department said
today in  Washington . A Bloomberg News survey had forecast claims
for jobless benefits increased by 2,000 to 365,000 last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
