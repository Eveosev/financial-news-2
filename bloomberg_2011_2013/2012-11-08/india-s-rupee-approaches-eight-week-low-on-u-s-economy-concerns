India ’s rupee fell toward a two-month
low on concern U.S. tax increases and spending cuts due next
year will hurt the world’s largest economy, aggravating a global
slowdown, unless policy makers defer or scale back the measures.  Re-elected President  Barack Obama  faces the so-called
fiscal cliff of expiring tax reductions and $1.2 trillion in
automatic spending decreases, unless Congress acts before then,
while seeking to support an economic recovery. Indian exporters
will probably step up dollar sales as the rupee approaches the
55 per dollar level, curbing declines in the local currency,
according to Edelweiss Financial Advisors Ltd.  “There’s concern whether the lingering problems, such as
the fiscal cliff, can be taken care of,” said Ravi Ranjit,
chief manager at  Federal Bank Ltd. (FB)  in Mumbai. “I think concerns
are now in the price and the dollar’s rally will be capped.”  The rupee declined 0.3 percent to 54.3750 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It fell to
54.6750 earlier, approaching a Nov. 6 level of 54.7750 that was
the lowest since Sept. 14. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 10
basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 10.20 percent.  The  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major trading partners, rose 0.1 percent,
adding to a 0.2 percent advance yesterday.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards were at 55.45 per
dollar, compared with 54.97 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.37 versus 54.96. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
