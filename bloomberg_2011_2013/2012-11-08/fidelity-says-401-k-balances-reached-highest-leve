Fidelity Investments, the largest
provider of 401(k) retirement plans, said average balances in
employer-sponsored accounts reached the highest level since it
began tracking values in 2000, as market gains boosted assets.  The average account balance in the U.S. rose to $75,900 as
of the third quarter, an increase of 18 percent from a year
earlier, according to a report released today by the Boston-
based Fidelity, which administers plans for about 12 million
workers.  “We’ve had a good quarter, a good year,” said  Beth McHugh , vice president of market insights for Fidelity. “The
biggest driver in the increase this quarter was the market.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained  27 percent in the 12
months ended Sept. 30. About 74 percent of the average-balance
growth in that period was driven by market appreciation and 26
percent was from participant contributions, according to
Fidelity.  A 401(k) generally lets employees contribute a portion of
their wages to the account on a pretax basis. Contributions are
limited to  $17,000  for 2012 and $17,500 in 2013. Those age 50 or
older may set aside an additional $5,500, according to the
Internal Revenue Service.  The average annual savings by workers was $5,900 as of
Sept. 30, compared with $5,500 in the third quarter of 2007, the
report said. Employer contributions, also known as a company
match, rose 19 percent to $3,420 in the same period.  Americans held  $3.3 trillion  in 401(k) plans as of June 30,
according to the latest data available from the Investment
Company Institute. The ICI is the Washington-based trade group
for the mutual-fund industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
