Siemens AG (SIE) , the biggest engineering
company in  Europe , said today that it plans to sell part of its
water business that generates about 1 billion euros ($1.27
billion) a year in sales.  The announcement on the day Siemens reported net income
from continuing operations fell 2 percent in the quarter ending
Sept. 30 comes after the Munich-based manufacturer last month
said it was pulling out of the solar business to focus on its
core operations.  The Siemens Water Technologies division includes
wastewater, municipal and industrial water purification services
and membrane filtration systems. The business has 4,500
employees, 3,000 of them in North America and 600 in Asia.  Siemens said it intends to keep its water pump business.
The water technologies business was formerly part of U.S. Filter
