Naphtha declined in northwest  Europe 
as Glencore International Plc sold two cargoes. Exports of the
product to Asia this month may be little changed from October.  Diesel barge  premiums  dropped from a four-year peak
relative to November gasoil on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in  London . Jet fuel advanced.  Light Products  Three cargoes of  naphtha  traded from $915 to $920 a metric
ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. That’s down from $926 to
$928 yesterday. Glencore and Trafigura Beheer BV sold to Koch
Industries Inc. and BP Plc.  The continent’s naphtha exports to Asia in November will
remain near the highest level in at least 34 months, according
to a Bloomberg survey of traders and shipbrokers.  Shipments of naphtha to  Asia  may reach 800,000 tons this
month, according to the median response in a survey of five
traders. Volumes rose to 850,000 tons in October, the highest
level since Bloomberg began conducting the poll in January 2010.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent, was little changed
at $5.12 a barrel as of 1:58 p.m. local time, according to PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and products broker in London.  Gasoline for loading in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp hub
traded from $933 to $940 a ton, according to a survey of traders
and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board and Platts
pricing window. That’s within yesterday’s range from $932 to
$960 a ton.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought barges for at least the ninth
day. Trafigura and Total SA also purchased the Eurobob grade, to
which ethanol is added to make finished fuel. Statoil ASA,
Chevron Corp., Vitol Group and Hess Corp.’s Hetco unit were
sellers of barges, which usually comprise 1,000 to 2,000 tons.  The fuel’s  crack , or premium to  Brent crude , was little
changed at $3.52 a barrel, the PVM data showed.  Middle Distillates  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel barges dropped to trade at premiums
of $57 to $60 to November gasoil on the ICE exchange, according
to the survey of Platts. That’s down from $66 yesterday, which
was the highest since April 2008. North Sea Group and Glencore
sold to Vitol and Morgan Stanley.  BP sold three barges of  jet fuel  to Vitol and Shell, the
survey of Platts showed. One of the lots traded at $84 a ton
more than November gasoil, up from $77 yesterday. The other two
lots traded at premiums of $79 and $82 to the December contract.  Heating oil  barges changed hands at a discount of $1 a ton
and at parity to November gasoil. That compares with trades at
minus $3 yesterday. Shell and Glencore bought, while Morgan
Stanley and Vitol sold.  Gasoil for November delivery dropped $6, or 0.6 percent, to
$925 a ton as of 5:08 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange. The
December contract was at a 75 cent discount to the front month,
keeping the market in backwardation, a structure that signals
near-term scarcity of supplies or increased demand. That’s
unchanged from yesterday.  Gasoil’s crack  was little changed at $16.79 a barrel at
4:30 p.m., declining from $16.94 the previous session. Brent
climbed 0.5 percent to $107.33 a barrel.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded from $571.50 to $573 a ton, the
Platts survey showed. That compares with $580 to $581.25 in the
previous session. The low-sulfur grade traded at $603 versus
$611 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
