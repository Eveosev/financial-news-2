U.S. stock futures maintained gains
after a report showed fewer Americans than forecast filed
claims for  unemployment insurance  last week.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in December
climbed 0.2 percent to 1,392.4 at 8:35 a.m. in New York.  Applications for jobless benefits fell by 8,000 to 355,000
in the week ended Nov. 3, the Labor Department said today in
Washington. One state said the loss of electricity due to
 Hurricane Sandy  suppressed filings, while others said workers
who lost their jobs as a result of the weather were starting to
apply, a Labor Department spokesman said as the data were
released to the press.  A separate report showed the  U.S. trade deficit 
unexpectedly narrowed in September to the lowest level in almost
two years as exports climbed to a record. The gap shrank 5.1
percent to $41.5 billion, the smallest since December 2010, from
$43.8 billion in August, Commerce Department figures showed
today in Washington.  Both the  S&P 500  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average
tumbled 2.4 percent yesterday as investors turned their
attention to the budget debate and the euro area’s debt crisis
following President  Barack Obama ’s re-election. Lawmakers face
$607 billion of tax increases and federal-spending cuts
that kick in automatically at the start of 2013, unless
Congress reaches a compromise.  The S&P 500 has surged 11 percent this year as central
banks stepped up stimulus to boost the global economy. About 71
percent of companies that released quarterly results have beaten
estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
