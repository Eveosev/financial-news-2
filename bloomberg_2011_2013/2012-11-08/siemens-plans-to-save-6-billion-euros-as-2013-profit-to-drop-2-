Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Europe ’s largest
engineering company, plans to save 6 billion euros ($7.7
billion) in two years as it braces for lower profit in 2013.  Siemens will slash costs by 5 billion euros, with an
additional 1 billion euros coming from improving marketing and
less complexity, the company said today. The program will cost 1
billion euros in 2013, and profit will decline to as little as
4.5 billion euros next year from 5.18 billion euros in 2012.  Chief Executive Officer  Peter Loescher  is embarking on his
most sweeping cost purge yet at the Munich-based manufacturer
after he was forced to reduce his profit goal earlier this year
and charges mount at the energy businesses. The savings plan
includes the disposal of parts of a water business with about 1
billion euros in sales, and the acquisition of LMS
International, a closely held maker of product life cycle
management software, for 680 million euros.  “We didn’t fully succeed in significantly boosting our
performance vis-a-vis competitors,” Loescher said in a
statement. “We know what we have to do, and we are doing it.”  Net income from continuing operations fell 2 percent to
1.48 billion euros in the quarter ended Sept. 30. That brought
profit for the fiscal year to 5.18 billion euros, within reach
of a company forecast for at least 5.2 billion euros. Sales rose
7 percent to 21.7 billion euros, the 10th consecutive gain.
Order intake rose 2 percent to 21.5 billion euros.  Siemens shares jumped 3.3 percent to 81.4 euros at the open
of trading in  Frankfurt .  Beating Estimates  Net income beat the mean estimate of 1.41 billion euros in
a Bloomberg survey of analysts, and sales came in ahead of an
estimate of 21.3 billion euros.  ’’Six billion euros in savings is a catchy number, but the
margin outlook shows Siemens will be able to retain only a small
part of that,’’ Michael Hagmann, an analyst at HSBC in  London 
said. Hagmann said he was disappointed over the lack of details
on potential portfolio changes beyond the water unit.  Siemens aims to raise operating profit as a percentage of
sales to 12 percent in its four main businesses by 2014, from
9.5 percent in 2012. The company proposed to pay a  dividend  of 3
euros a share for 2012, unchanged from the prior year.  The decline in profit next year is partly due to adopting
new rules for accounting of pension costs, Siemens said. Sales
will come close to the level of 2012 next year, while order
intake will rise moderately.  Siemens booked 566 million euros in charges at its energy
operations, including a writedown of 327 million euros due to
stricter European Union rules for trade with  Iran , 133 million
euros to reduce capacity in some power transmission operations,
and 106 million euros for a nuclear power project in  Finland .  Additional Costs  The company in the quarter had a loss of 173 million euros
in the solar power business it plans to sell. Loescher declined
to say how many jobs may be cut with the new program, or what
other parts of the portfolio may be put up for sale.  Charges attached to the savings program will total as much
as 1.5 billion euros through 2014, Loescher said in a speech.
Siemens will reorganize a building technology business to save
100 million euros and productivity improvements at fossil power
will generate a benefit of 250 million euros.  ’’Where structural changes in the market are happening, you
will see an impact’’ on jobs, Loescher said in a televised
interview with Bloomberg. ’’We are taking decisive action in our
portfolio. We have to roll up our sleeves.’’  LMS, based in Leuven,  Belgium , had sales of about 140
million euros in the nine months through September, and employs
1,200 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
