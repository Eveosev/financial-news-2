Ruspetro Plc (RPO) , a Russian oil explorer,
rose the most in eight weeks in London trading after reporting a
40 percent increase in oil and condensate output and reiterating
its year-end target.  Ruspetro climbed as much as 8.4 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since Sept. 13, and traded up 7.4 percent at 107.4
pence as of 8:38 a.m. London time.  Production has reached 7,853 barrels a day, up from 5,600
barrels a day on July 9, the Moscow-based company said today in
a regulatory filing. Ruspetro, which operates at western
Siberiaâ€™s Krasnoleninsk field, is on schedule to pump 10,400
barrels a day by the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
