Ghabbour Auto, (AUTO)  the Egyptian
distributer of Hyundai Motor Co., Volvo AB and Mitsubishi  cars,
expects sales to rise this quarter and next year after supply
constraints eased and amid expansions in Libya and  Algeria .  GB Auto, the biggest independent auto assembler in the
 Middle East , reported a  26 percent decline  in third-quarter
profit, missing two analysts’ estimates. Labor strikes crimped
supply of parts from Hyundai Motor Co. in the quarter. GB Auto
began assembling Emgrand7 cars of Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd.
in mid-October.  “This quarter reflects a shortage of supply in Egypt and
 Iraq  for Hyundai cars,” Chief Executive Officer Raouf Ghabbour
said in a conference call last night. “We’re hopefully going to
receive improved allocations in November and December.”  GB Auto, which has a 31 percent market share of passenger
cars in  Egypt , is assembling 300 Geely Emgrand7 cars a month and
expects that to double by January, Ghabbour said. The company is
also working with Hyundai to “redefine” the luxury car segment
in Egypt, and started a rental and leasing unit marketing to
diplomatic missions and multinational companies.  Ghabbour said commercial vehicles sales could see a
“slight improvement” this quarter although investments in
infrastructure and tourism in Egypt remains tepid. He didn’t
provide details on its Libya and Algeria expansion plans.  GB Auto shares  have surged 50 percent this year compared
with a 54 percent gain for the  benchmark EGX30 index.   To contact the reporter on this story:
