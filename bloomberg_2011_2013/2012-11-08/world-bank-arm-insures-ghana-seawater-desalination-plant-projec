A Ghana seawater desalination project
meant to benefit about 500,000 people is receiving $179 million
in backing from the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency,
the political risk insurance arm of the  World Bank .  The Washington, D.C.-based agency said the investment would
help provide 60,000 cubic meters of potable water a day to
residents and businesses where supplies are irregular and
quality can be spotty in the Teshie-Nungua area of Accra, the
country’s capital.  Last month,  Sojitz Corp. (2768)  said a subsidiary, Daye Water
Investment (Ghana) BV of the Netherlands, will take part in the
desalination project with the Spanish company Abengoa SA, the
first of its type in sub-Saharan Africa.  The MGIA coverage covers an equity investment and
shareholder loan by Abengoa, an equity investment and
shareholder loan by Daye Water, and a non-shareholder loan and
interest-rate swap by Standard Bank of South  Africa  Ltd. against
risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, breach of
contract, war and civil disturbance.  About 4 million of Ghana’s 24 million populace live in
Accra and the surrounding area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
