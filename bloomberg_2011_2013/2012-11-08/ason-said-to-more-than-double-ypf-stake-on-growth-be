Mason Capital Management LLC has more
than doubled its stake in  YPF SA (YPFD)  since September, betting the
nationalized energy company can increase production and profit,
according to three people with knowledge of the transactions.  Mason exceeded a 3 percent ownership threshold that
requires it to advise YPF under the Buenos Aires-based company’s
statutes, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the transactions haven’t been made public. In the second
quarter, Mason acquired 5.54 million YPF shares, or 1.39
percent, after  Argentina  seized control of the company from
 Spain ’s Repsol SA, according to its latest 13F filing.  YPF has lost investors 70 percent this year, making it the
worst performer among peers, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It’s also the cheapest, trading at 3.52 times
estimated 2012 profit. President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner 
expropriated YPF in April, accusing Madrid-based Repsol of
underinvesting. YPF’s market value is $4.1 billion.  YPF spokesman Alejandro Di Lazzaro declined to comment in
an e-mailed response. Mason Chief Financial Officer John Grizzetti didn’t reply to calls or an e-mail seeking comment.  Mason began adding to its position after executives met
with YPF Chief Executive Officer Miguel Galuccio late September
in  Buenos Aires , two of the people said.  Grupo Financiero Inbursa is YPF’s largest institutional
shareholder with 6.59 percent, followed by Lazard Asset
Management LLC with 3.12 percent, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
