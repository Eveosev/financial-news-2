The so-called fiscal cliff may take a
bigger toll on the U.S. economy than the  Congressional Budget
Office  projects, according to David J. Stockton, a senior fellow
at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former
top economic forecaster at the Federal Reserve.  The three-year-old U.S. expansion faces headwinds from a
slowing global economy and the risk lawmakers will fail to avert
$607 billion in federal tax increases and spending cuts slated
to take place next year.  Reaching the fiscal cliff will probably tip the world’s
largest economy into a recession, with gross domestic product
shrinking 0.5 percent in 2013, the CBO said on Aug. 22.  “Going over the fiscal cliff is going to be much more
costly than even the CBO’s analysis suggested,” Stockton said
at a conference held by the Peterson Institute in  Washington 
today. “I actually don’t see much benefit in going over the
fiscal cliff.”  Congress lined up the spending cuts in 2011 as part of an
agreement to raise the federal debt ceiling and cut future
deficits. After President  Barack Obama ’s re-election, Vice
President Joe Biden said he had been making “a lot of phone
calls,” and voiced optimism that Republicans would cooperate on
a compromise to avert the fiscal cliff.  At a news conference on Capitol Hill yesterday, Republican
Speaker of the House John Boehner said all sides are “closer
than many think” to a U.S. tax-code overhaul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
