Georgia filed criminal charges
against an ex-minister allied with President Mikheil
Saakashvili, whose ruling party lost parliamentary elections
last month.  Bacho Akhalaia, a former interior and defense minister, was
charged with abuse of office and false imprisonment, his lawyer,
Joseph Janashia, said today in Tbilisi, the capital. He faces as
long as 12 years in prison if found guilty, according to
Janashia, who didn’t provide further details of the case.  Akhalaia, who was detained yesterday, resigned as interior
minister in September after footage of prison guards beating and
raping male inmates was broadcast. The questioning concerned his
tenure as defense minister, not the prison scandal, according to
David Dekanoidze, another of his lawyers.  Billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s opposition coalition
unexpectedly defeated U.S.-backed President Saakashvili’s party
in Oct. 1 elections, nominating the businessman as prime
minister that month.  As well as Akhalaia, former chief of staff Giorgi
Kalandadze was charged with abuse of office, his lawyer Gogita
Gabaidze said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
