General Electric Co. (GE) , the biggest
maker of electrical generation equipment, will supply 43
turbines to Fina Enerji Holding AS for wind projects in  Turkey .  The wind parks will total 97 megawatts in capacity and
power 27,000 Turkish homes when built, according to a statement
today from Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE.  Turkey is seeking to boost wind capacity to 20,000
megawatts by 2023 from about 1,800 megawatts now to meet
electricity demand that’s increased 6 percent a year, Economy
Minister Zafer Caglayan said in June. The market has attracted
turbine manufacturers including Sinovel Wind Group Co. and
 Siemens AG (SIE)  with premium payments for low-carbon power.  GE will supply the Kizilcaterzi wind farm, the Karadere
park, the Sadilli project and the Salman venture in the nation’s
west, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
