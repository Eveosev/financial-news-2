  Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado
de Sao Paulo ,  Brazil ’s biggest water distributor, is seeking a
partner to develop a 1.68-billion real ($823 million) project
that will supply water to municipalities surrounding Sao Paulo.  The Sao Lourenco Water Producing System will be developed
under a private-public partnership and a contract is expected to
be signed by September 2013, the Sao Paulo-based utility said in
a statement issued today at a press event.  The population of Sao Paulo’s metropolitan region is
growing by 300,000 a year, faster than most other Brazilian
cities, Chief Executive Officer Dilma Pena said today at the
gathering announcing the project.  “We have very little water up here at 700 meters (2,296
feet),” Geraldo Alckmin, the governor of  Sao Paulo  state, said
today at the event, referring to the city’s altitude.  Companies will be able to submit their proposals on Jan. 8
and will be wholly responsible for financing the facility,
Alckmin said. The concession period is 25 years.  The project may take as many as 48 months to build and will
deliver 4,700 liters (1,240 gallons) of water a second to cities
when operational by 2017,  he said. It includes a water
treatment plant in Vargem Grande Paulista and 83 kilometers (52
miles) of pipeline, according to the statement.  Sabesp fell 1.8 percent to 83.77 reais at the close in Sao
Paulo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
