Chile ’s central bank will allow banks
to pawn bonds in return for cash once a week until December to
avoid a repeat of last year’s liquidity squeeze.  In the  repurchase agreements , or repos, the central bank
will charge 25 basis points more than its benchmark rate, now at
5 percent, for loans due in 60 or 90 days, it said today in a
statement on its website.  Last December the bank started offering twice-weekly repo
operations after short-term borrowing costs spiked. Liquidity
often falls at the end of the year in Chile as companies seek
cash to bolster balance sheets, withdrawing money from the
short-term debt funds that lend to the banks.  The central bank bought $952 million of assets denominated
in pesos for repurchase in three months or less between Dec. 21
and Dec. 30. Short-term borrowing costs in pesos plunged after
the intervention.  The spread between 90-day interbank loan rates and the
benchmark fell to 1.39 percent today from 1.48 percent a week
ago. The spread went as high as 2.2 percent in December. The
spread between 90-day interbank loans and the three-month peso
swap rate fell to 1.4 percent from 1.52 percent a week ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
