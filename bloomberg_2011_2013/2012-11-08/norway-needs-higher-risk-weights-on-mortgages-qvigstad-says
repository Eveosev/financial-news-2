Norges Bank Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad said  Norway  should tighten risk weights on  mortgage
loans  to free up capital for other lending and ease pressure in
the housing market.  “One problem is that the risk weights for housing loans
are very low,” he said today in interview in Lillehammer,
Norway. “If that had been higher the banks would have been more
eager to lend to businesses relative to households and
housing.”  The central bank last week decided last week to keep its
benchmark rate at 1.5 percent for a fourth meeting and to push
back any increase to March at the earliest. The bank doesn’t
want to raise rates too much to avoid large difference to the
euro area, which is struggling to contain its debt crisis.  Rate increases would help balance an economy that’s showing
signs of overheating. Norway’s Financial Supervisory Authority
has warned that Europe’s second-biggest oil exporter may be
facing a housing bubble as credit growth and sent private debt
loads to almost double disposable incomes.  Norwegian  household debt  was 195 percent of disposable
incomes in the third quarter of 2011 according to the most
recently available data. It will rise to 202 percent by the end
of next year, according to the central bank.  Risk weights, as defined by Basel II regulations, on
mortgage loans in Norway are 11 percent, compared with 15
percent in  Germany  and as high as 35 percent in  Spain , according
to data from the Swedish central bank. Risk weights determine
how much capital a bank must set aside to guard against
potential losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
