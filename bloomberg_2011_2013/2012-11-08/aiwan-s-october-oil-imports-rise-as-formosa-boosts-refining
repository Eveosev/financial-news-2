Taiwan , which imports more than 99
percent of its crude needs, purchased more of the fuel last
month as  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  increased processing.  Shipments rose 13.2 percent from a year earlier to 27.6
million barrels, or about 890,000 barrels a day, in October, the
 Ministry of Finance  said in Taipei today. The island’s oil bill
increased 19.5 percent to $3.13 billion, the ministry said in a
statement.  October revenue for Formosa Petrochemical, Taiwan’s only
publicly traded oil refiner, climbed 19 percent from a year
earlier as the company increased its output of fuels and
petrochemicals, the company said in a statement on Nov. 5. Crude
refined in the month was 30,000 barrels a day higher than a year
earlier, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
