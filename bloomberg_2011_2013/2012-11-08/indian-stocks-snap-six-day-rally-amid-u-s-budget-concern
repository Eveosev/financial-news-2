Indian stocks fell for the first time
in seven days after the re-election of U.S. President  Barack Obama  set up a budget confrontation with Republicans.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, lost 0.4 percent
to 18,835.43, according to preliminary closing prices as of 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai. It rose 2.6 percent in the past six days.
 Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , the software exporter that got 64 percent of its
revenue from North America in the year ended March, led its
peers lower.  Tata Power Co. (TPWR) , the largest non-state generator,
slumped for a second day after posting a surprise loss.  The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  declined 0.3 percent,
extending yesterdayâ€™s 1.5 percent slump, amid concerns Obama now
faces negotiating with Congress to avoid the so-called fiscal
cliff of more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending
cuts next year that threaten to slow U.S. growth, hurting the
outlook for Asian exporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
