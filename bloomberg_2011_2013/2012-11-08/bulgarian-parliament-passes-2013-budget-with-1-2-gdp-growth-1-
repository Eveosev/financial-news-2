Bulgaria’s Parliament approved the
first reading of next year’s budget, which targets a deficit of
1.3 percent of economic output and has a 10 percent tax on
interest from deposits as spending rises before elections.  Lawmakers in Sofia voted 122 to 60 in favor of the budget,
which has yet to pass a final reading item by item, Speaker
Tsetska Tsatcheva said in Parliament in Sofia today. The plan
assumes economic growth of 1.2 percent under a pessimistic
scenario and 1.9 percent under an optimistic one.  “The budget aims to increase people’s incomes next year,”
Finance Minister  Simeon Djankov  told the assembly. “The budget
will be implemented with a consistent spending policy and we’ll
have one of the three lowest in the European Union levels of
debt-to-GDP ratio and deficit.”  Bulgaria, the EU’s poorest country in terms of gross
domestic product per capita, weathered the global crisis without
borrowing from lenders abroad. Growth slowed to 0.5 percent from
a year earlier in the second quarter, the same as in the first
three months.  Next year’s budget-deficit target is unchanged from this
year. Revenue is estimated at 30.6 billion lev ($20.1 billion)
or 37.5 percent of GDP, a 6.4 percent increase from this year.
Spending is projected at 31.7 billion lev, or 38.8 percent of
GDP, a 6.5 percent increase from 2012.  Credit default swaps, which decline as perceptions of
creditworthiness improve, traded at 107 points today, compared
with 179 points on Oct. 1.  Accelerating Inflation  The government forecasts average EU-harmonized inflation at
3.4 percent next year, after 2.6 percent this year. The public
debt limit is set at 14.6 billion lev, or 17.8 percent of GDP,
in 2013.  The government plans to keep personal and corporate income
taxes unchanged from a flat 10 percent next year, in an effort
to attract more investment and boost growth, according to the
budget.  Bulgaria  will raise pensions by 9.3 percent, minimal wages
by about 7 percent and army salaries by 9 percent next year,
Djankov said.  The European Commission raised this year’s economic growth
forecast for Bulgaria yesterday to 0.8 percent from a 0.5
percent estimate in March and to 1.4 percent for 2013 from 1.9
percent. The economy grew 1.7 percent last year, after a revised
0.4 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
