Air Mauritius Ltd. (AML) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s fourth-biggest airline, returned to profit in the
second quarter and said a reorganization plan would help it
deliver a full-year profit in fiscal 2014.  Net income in the three months through September was 1.27
million euros ($1.62 million), compared with a loss of 7.69
million euros a year earlier, according to a statement handed to
reporters today in Port Louis, the Mauritian capital. Revenue
declined 3 percent to 112.9 million euros.  The profit is “an encouraging step forward” for the
airline and vindication of a reorganization plan put in place by
management, said Chief Executive Officer Andre Viljoen. The
third quarter, which coincides with the tourism high season in
Mauritius, will probably deliver further gains and help offset a
loss in the first three months of the financial year, he said.  Air Mauritius is cutting long-haul routes to  Europe  and
adding additional flights to Africa and  Asia  as part of an
eight-step plan for the company to report an annual profit by
fiscal year 2014. The strategy also includes the acquisition of
fuel-efficient aircraft.  Revenue for the six months through September advanced to
217.8 million euros from 209.9 million euros, according to the
statement. First-half losses were cut to 9 million euros from
19.3 million euros.  Air Mauritius shares  declined  38 percent this year,
compared with a 12 percent drop in the  40-member SEMDEX guage .
The stock was unchanged at 10 rupees by the 1:30 p.m. close,
with 24,780 units traded, or almost twice the three-month daily
average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
