Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII) 
fell after the U.S. Navy’s sole builder of aircraft carriers
reported third-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates.  Huntington, based in  Newport News , Virginia, declined 5
percent to close at $41.29 in  New York  trading. The shares
dropped 3.3 percent yesterday after President Barack Obama won
re-election and defeated  Mitt Romney , who had proposed
increasing military spending. The two-day drop is the most since
Sept. 29, 2011.  Profit fell to $37.1 million, or 74 cents a share, in the
quarter ended Sept. 30 from $51.3 million, or $1.05, in the
year-earlier period. Analysts had predicted per-share profit of
80 cents, the average of 13 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Underperforming ships at Ingalls continue to prove
challenging,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Petters said in a
statement.  Sales totaled $1.6 billion in the quarter, with less-than-
expected revenue from amphibious assault ships. Analysts predict
2012 sales to increase 1 percent to $6.63 billion.  Separately, the company announced its first quarterly
dividend, at 10 cents a share, and plans to buy back as much as
$150 million of shares over three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
