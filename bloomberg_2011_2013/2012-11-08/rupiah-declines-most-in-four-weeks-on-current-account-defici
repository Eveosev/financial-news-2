Indonesia ’s rupiah fell by the most
in four weeks after the nation recorded its fourth straight
quarterly current-account deficit.  Government bonds  were steady
after the central bank kept borrowing costs unchanged.  The  current-account deficit  narrowed to 2.4 percent of
gross domestic product in the third quarter, from 3.5 percent in
the previous period, the central bank said today. The  trade
surplus  rose to $553 million in September, from a revised $233
million the previous month, even as  exports  contracted for a
sixth month.  Bank Indonesia  maintained its benchmark reference
rate at a record-low 5.75 percent for a ninth month, as
predicted by all 16 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The risk for the rupiah is really tilted toward further
weakening,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp. in Singapore. “The big problem for the currency
is the current-account position. Improvement in the  trade
balance  won’t help much if export growth is still lagging.”  The rupiah declined 0.3 percent to 9,638 per dollar as of
3:32 p.m. in Jakarta, the most since Oct. 10, prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg show. The currency reached 9,668
yesterday, the weakest level since October 2009. One-month
implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was steady at 5 percent.  Overseas investors sold $246 million more local shares than
they bought in November, exchange data show, while adding 4.98
trillion rupiah ($517 million) to their holdings of government
debt, according to finance ministry data. Foreign funds held a
record 255.31 trillion rupiah of Indonesian bonds as of Nov. 6.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent notes due May 2022
was little changed at 5.62 percent, the lowest level since March
5, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
