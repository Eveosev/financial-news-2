More than half of American smokers
tried to quit the habit as the daily use of cigarettes fell,
U.S. health officials said.  About 19 percent of U.S. adults, or 43.8 million, reported
smoking daily or most days in 2011, little changed from 19.3
percent a year earlier, according to data from the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention today. That’s down from more
than 20 percent in 2005. About 52 percent of those surveyed
reported trying to stop smoking in the preceding year.  The number of  cigarettes  Americans are smoking each day has
fallen. In 2011, 9.1 percent of daily smokers reported puffing
on more than 30 cigarettes daily, a drop from 12.6 percent six
year earlier. Even so, the number of  smokers  in the U.S. is
still too high, exceeding the 12 percent goal for American
adults, the CDC said.  “Tobacco use remains the single largest preventable cause
of death and disease in the United States,” the Atlanta-based
agency said in its report, citing 2010 data from the U.S.
Surgeon General showing that about 443,000 U.S. adults die from
smoking-related causes annually.  Smoking costs the U.S. an estimated $96 billion in direct
medical expenses and $97 billion in lost productivity each year,
according to the report. The CDC called for measures including
raising the price of tobacco products, increasing access to
programs aimed to help people quit smoking, airing graphic
commercials about the dangers of tobacco and implementing smoke-
free laws.  “Such population-based interventions have been shown to
reduce population smoking prevalence as well as overall smoking
intensity,” the CDC said.  Those smoking fewer than 10 cigarettes a day increased to
22 percent in 2011 from 16.4 percent six years earlier, the
agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
