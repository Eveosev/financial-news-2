A Sudanese rebel group said it shot
down a government Antonov plane that had been carrying out
bombing raids in the oil-rich state of Southern Kordofan.  The Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North group said its
fighters shot down the Antonov at 5 p.m. yesterday and it
crashed near the Jau area close to the border with  South Sudan .
Sudanese army spokesman al-Sawarami Khaled didn’t answer calls
to his mobile phone seeking comment.  The plane carried out bombing missions in the state that
killed at least two civilians, including a child, rebel spokeman
Arnu Lodi said in an e-mailed statement.  Clashes started more than a year ago in Southern Kordofan
and Blue Nile states between President Umar al-Bashir’s
government and rebels who fought during a two-decade civil war
alongside the forces of South Sudan, which gained independence
in July last year. More than 175,000 people have fled the
violence into South Sudan, according to the  United Nations .  In May, New York-based  Human Rights Watch  said
indiscriminate bombings and abuses against civilians by
government forces in the Nuba Mountains area of Southern
Kordofan may constitute  war crimes  and crimes against humanity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
