Mortgage rates were little changed,
keeping borrowing costs close to record lows after home prices
increased in more U.S. cities.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage climbed to
3.4 percent in the week ended today from 3.39 percent, Freddie
Mac said in a statement. The average 15-year rate fell to 2.69
percent from 2.7 percent, according to the McLean, Virginia-
based mortgage-finance company.  Low interest rates are making real estate more affordable,
while rising demand is bolstering values. Single-family home
prices climbed in the third quarter from a year earlier in 120
of 149 U.S. metropolitan areas measured, the National
Association of Realtors said in a report yesterday. In the
second quarter, 110 areas had gains.  “There is absolutely a direct relationship between falling
interest rates and rising prices,” Keith Gumbinger, vice
president of HSH.com, a Pompton Plains, New Jersey-based
mortgage-information website, said yesterday in a telephone
interview. “More borrowers can come out and participate in
markets that would have been considered too expensive for
them.”  The 30-year average reached an all-time low of 3.36 percent
last month, while the 15-year hit a record of 2.66 percent,
according to Freddie Mac.  To contact the reporter on this story:
