Taiwan dollar  forwards declined and
the local currency trimmed gains after the island reported
exports unexpectedly fell last month.  Overseas sales declined 1.9 percent in October, after
rising 10.4 percent in September, official data showed today.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for a 2 percent
gain. The forwards touched a six-month high earlier ahead of
Chinese data due to be released tomorrow that is forecast to
show factory output and retail sales accelerated in October.
 China  is  Taiwan ’s largest export market.  “There are a lot of people thinking this currency is going
to gain support from China because of the recovery,” said Craig
Chan, head of Asia ex-Japan foreign-exchange strategy at Nomura
Holdings Inc. in  Singapore .  One-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.1 percent to
NT$29.070 versus the greenback as of 5:53 p.m. in Taipei,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reached
NT$29.010 earlier, the strongest level since May 9, and are at a
0.5 percent premium to the spot rate.  The Taiwan dollar closed little changed at NT$29.202
against its U.S. counterpart, according to data from Taipei
Forex Inc. It was up as much as 0.3 percent earlier and touched
NT$29.103, the strongest level since May 2. The currency has
gained 2.4 percent since June 30. One-month implied volatility,
a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
unchanged at 3.6 percent.  The yield on the government’s 2 percent bonds due July 2017
held at 0.884 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.
The  overnight interbank lending  rate was little changed at 0.385
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
