Confidence in the euro-area economy
plunged in the fourth quarter to the lowest in more than three
years as governments struggle to rein in deficits and weak
demand fuels unemployment,  Germany ’s  Ifo institute  said.  An index measuring economic sentiment in the 17-nation
currency bloc fell to 81.7 from 88.9 in the three months through
September, Munich-based Ifo said in an e-mailed statement today,
citing its quarterly World Economic Survey. That’s the lowest
since the third quarter of 2009. A measure of current conditions
fell to 97.9 from 103.5, while a gauge of expectations dropped
to 72.1 from 80.3.  “In most euro-member countries, expectations for the next
six months have deteriorated,” Ifo said. “An economic recovery
isn’t yet in sight.”  While Germany’s economic conditions worsened somewhat in
the fourth quarter, they can still be considered satisfactory,
Ifo said. Sentiment in Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and
Ireland remain at levels suggesting recession.  Euro-area inflation expectations for 2012 rose to 2.4
percent from 2.2 percent, Ifo said. Survey respondents predict
short-term  interest rates  and the  exchange rate  versus the  U.S.
dollar  will remain broadly unchanged.  The survey is based on responses from 270 economic experts
and conducted in cooperation with the International Chamber of
Commerce in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
