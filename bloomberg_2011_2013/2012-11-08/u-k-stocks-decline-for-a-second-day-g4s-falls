U.K. stocks declined for a second
day, after earlier gains.  G4S Plc declined the most in two months after losing a U.K.
prison contract. Balfour Beatty Plc sank the most in 14 years as
the U.K.’s largest construction company said the outlook for
profit margins has faded because of a lack of building work in
Britain. BTG Plc jumped 8 percent after the drugmaker reported
an increase in first-half earnings and revenue. Burberry Group
Plc climbed 1.3 percent.  The FTSE 100 Index fell 17.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to
5,773.98 at 3:51 p.m. in  London , after earlier climbing as much
as 0.6 percent. The gauge fell 1.6 percent yesterday as the
European Commission cut its euro-area growth forecast and
concern over an impending U.S. fiscal crisis overshadowed the
re-election of President  Barack Obama . The FTSE All-Share Index
dropped 0.3 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ fell 0.9
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
