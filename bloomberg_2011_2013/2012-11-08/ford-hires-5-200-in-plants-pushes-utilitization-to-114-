Ford Motor Co. (F) , the second-largest
U.S. automaker, has added about 5,200 jobs this year in its U.S.
factories, and its North American plants are operating at 114
percent of capacity, the highest in more than three decades.  “Our manufacturing costs have gone down this year,” Jim Tetreault, Ford’s vice president of North American
manufacturing, told reporters today at a factory in Wayne,
Michigan. “Two things are driving that, capacity utilization
and entry-level workers. No question, those two things have
lowered our costs.”  Ford’s contract with the  United Auto Workers  allows the
automaker to pay new hires about $16 an hour, less than 60
percent of what veteran workers receive. Ford has added about
4,800 of those entry-level workers to its payroll this year,
said Todd Nissen, a company spokesman. The remainder of the new
jobs went to workers transferring from other Ford factories or
coming out of the “jobs bank” of employees who didn’t have job
assignments. Ford’s jobs bank is now empty, Tetreault said.  Ford’s is running its factories at their highest level of
utilization in Tetreault’s career at the automaker, which spans
more than 30 years, he said. Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford has
added third shifts of workers at five North American assembly
plants.  Ford is adding a shift of 1,200 workers at its Flat Rock,
 Michigan , factory next year. Asked if Ford will need more
workers and capacity as U.S. auto sales grow, Tetreault said:
