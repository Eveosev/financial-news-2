Vietnam ’s two-year bonds rose for a
second day, pushing the yield down by the most since July, on
speculation banks are investing spare funds in debt as lending
slows. The dong strengthened.  Vietnamese lenders have surplus cash now, Do Thi Nhung,
deputy head of the central bank’s monetary policy department,
told a conference in Hanoi on Nov. 5. Loans at domestic banks
have grown 3.3 percent this year, Thoi Bao Kinh Te Vietnam
newspaper reported Nov. 6, citing information from the  State
Bank  of Vietnam. That trailed a 14 percent jump in deposits this
year through Oct. 19, according to official figures.  Given the “comfortable liquidity conditions at large banks
and slower-than-expected credit growth,  credit institutions  are
likely to increase investment in bonds,” Vietcombank Securities
analysts Pham Thuy Linh and Trinh Quang Dung wrote in a research
report today. Short-term yields may fall further, they wrote.  The yield on two-year bonds fell 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 9.56 percent, according to a daily fixing
rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level
since Sept. 14 and the biggest decline since July 30. The yield
on benchmark five-year bonds was unchanged at 10.10 percent.  The dong traded at 20,843 per dollar as of 3:36 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,848 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The State Bank of Vietnam set its
 reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to
its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
