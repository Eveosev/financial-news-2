Serbian lawmakers approved guarantees
that allow Srbijagas JP, the natural-gas monopoly, to borrow 190
million euros ($242.6 million) from seven banks and cover some
of last year’s debts.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and Amsterdam Trade Bank NV will together
provide 70 million euros. Belgrade-based Volksbank AD will lend
70 million euros, Serbian units of Hungary’s  OTP Bank Plc (OTP) ,
 Societe Generale SA (GLE)  and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  will put up 10 million
euros each and Vojvodjanska Banka AD, a member of  Greece ’s
 National Bank of Greece SA , will provide 20 million euros.  The borrowing through so-called “euro-indexed loans” is
“supportive of the dinar” because the lenders must sell euros
for dinars, said Ratko Guduric, the deputy head of treasury at
Vojvodjanska Banka AD in Belgrade.  The dinar traded at 112.6690 to the euro at 12:27 p.m. in
Belgrade, or 0.53 percent up on the day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The loan is part of what the state-owned company plans to
raise by the end of 2012, its general manager Dusan Bajatovic
told lawmakers on Nov. 6.  “There will be another  credit line  worth 170 million
euros” to cover this year’s debts, Bajatovic said.  Srbijagas owed more than 60 billion dinars ($678.98
million) to banks at the end of 2011, of which two-thirds were
already long-term loans. The new, five-year loans come with a
one-year grace period and quarterly debt repayments. The cost of
new borrowing ranges from 5.98 percent and 7.25 percent on top
of a three-month Euribor.  Russia Gas  The company sells gas at prices below those paid to buy the
gas from  Russia .  Srbijagas claims 150 million euros from heating plants and
another 400 million euros from industrial consumers for
delivered gas and pins hopes on a 10 percent price increase in
2013 and cheaper gas imports to boost its finances, Bajatovic
said.  Talks are under way to try to lower import prices to $360
from $420 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas.  To contact the reporters on this story:
