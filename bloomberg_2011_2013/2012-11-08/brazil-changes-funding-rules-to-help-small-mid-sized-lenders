(Corrects to say new rule allows more banks to benefit from
initiative in second paragraph.)  Brazil ’s central bank changed the
rules for sales of loan portfolios as it seeks to boost funding
for small- and mid-sized banks.  Regulators raised to 3.5 billion reais ($1.72 billion) from
2.2 billion reais the maximum capital of banks allowed to
benefit from an initiative to stimulate the purchase of loan
books by rivals, according to a statement today. Under the
program, banks can use some of the  reserve requirements  that
they keep on deposit at the central bank to buy the portfolios.  The banks that sell portfolios must also have at least 20
percent of assets in lending operations to qualify for the
program, the central bank said. The new rules also allow long-
term local bonds, known as Letras Financeiras, to be sold under
the initiative.  Brazil’s small- and mid-sized banks have been facing a
squeeze on credit after regulators seized or bailed out seven
banks since 2010. On Oct. 19, the central bank took control of
Banco BVA SA on violations of industry standards one month after
it decided to liquidate  Banco Cruzeiro do Sul  SA amid fraud
investigations.  The central bank said the measure is effective as of today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
