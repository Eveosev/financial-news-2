Colombia ’s peso bond yields rose as
investors sold the securities to increase cash holdings after
the collapse of the Andean nation’s biggest brokerage.  The yield on Colombia’s 9.25 percent peso-denominated debt
due in May 2014 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 4.93 percent, according to the central bank. The price
fell 0.057 centavo to 106.099 centavos per peso.  Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said yesterday that
regulators will liquidate Interbolsa SA’s brokerage after it
failed to meet a loan payment last week.  “Investors have been selling assets, searching for
liquidity” following Interbolsa’s collapse, said Jorge Cardozo,
an analyst at Corredores Asociados brokerage in Bogota.
“Trading volume is low but little by little we are starting to
see things pick up again.”  Colombia’s central bank began yesterday offering 300
billion pesos ($165 million) of 14-day  repurchase agreements  to
boost liquidity, accepting securities including corporate bonds
as collateral. Today 4 billion pesos of the repos were taken by
investors, while none were taken yesterday.  The peso erased an earlier drop, gaining 0.2 percent to
1,810.25 per  U.S. dollar . The currency has strengthened 7.1
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
