The pound strengthened for a second
day against the euro after the  Bank of England  halted expansion
of its bond-buying  program  and kept its key  interest rate  at a
 record low  of 0.5 percent.  Sterling gained against most of its major counterparts
after the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee led by Governor
 Mervyn King  kept its target for asset purchases at 375 billion
pounds ($599 billion) today, ending its third round of so-called
quantitative easing. The decision was forecast by 35 of 45
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The remainder had
predicted an increase of as much as 50 billion pounds. Ten-year
gilts fell, pushing the yield up from a three-week low.  “U.K. policy makers have been pretty outspoken in
believing we’re reaching the end of what QE can achieve,” said
Kit Juckes, head of foreign-exchange research at Societe
Generale SA in  London . “The  European Central Bank  has more bond
buying to do and I think sterling should strengthen versus the
euro.”  The pound gained 0.2 percent to 79.74 pence per euro at
4:26 p.m. London time, after reaching 79.61 pence, the strongest
level since Oct. 1. Sterling was little changed at $1.5976 after
dropping to $1.5930, the weakest since Oct. 23.  Juckes forecast the pound to strengthen to 70 pence per
euro within five years. That level hasn’t been reached since
November 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The pound gained 1.6 percent this year according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro fell 3.4 percent, while
the dollar dropped 1.5 percent.  Gilts Slip  The  10-year gilt  yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.77 percent after falling to 1.73 percent,
the lowest since Oct. 15. The 1.75 percent bond due in September
2022 dropped 0.08, or 80 pence per 1,000-pound face amount, to
99.835. The rate on 30-year securities was one basis point lower
at 3.06 percent.  “Gilts in the five to 10-year sector have given up some
ground as a result of today’s BOE announcement and are
underperforming bunds,” said Adam McCormack, head of gilt sales
at Barclays Plc in London. “The long-end of the curve is
holding up well,” he said, referring to longer-maturity bonds.  The difference in yield, or  spread , between 10-year gilts
and their German equivalents widened by three basis points to 41
basis points, the most since May 29.  Gilts have returned 3.2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds gained 3.9 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  earned 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
