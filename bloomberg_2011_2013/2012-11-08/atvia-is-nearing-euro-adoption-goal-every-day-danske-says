Latvia  is getting closer to adopting
the euro as slower inflation helps the Baltic nation meet a key
criterion for the currency switch,  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  said.  Copenhagen-based Danske cut its 2012 inflation forecast for
Latvia to 2.4 percent from 2.8 percent and lowered next year’s
to 1.9 percent from 2.5 percent, according to a report e-mailed
today. Consumer-price growth unexpectedly slowed to 1.6 percent
in October, the lowest rate in two years, the  statistics office 
reported after Danske’s projections were released.  “Latvia is getting closer to the euro every day,”  Violeta Klyviene , a senior analyst at Danske, wrote in the report.
Inflation “will continue to slow, positively influencing
private-sector demand.”  Latvia plans to adopt the euro in 2014 after meeting debt,
budget-deficit, interest-rate and inflation thresholds. Cutting
the value-added tax by one percentage point in July helped tame
price growth, according to Danske.  To contact the reporter on this story:
