European (SXXP)  stocks fell, extending
yesterday’s biggest decline in two weeks, as a selloff in auto
manufacturers overshadowed results from Swiss Re Ltd. and  Hermes
International (RMS)  SCA that beat analysts’ estimates.  PSA Peugeot Citroen SA (UG)  and  Valeo SA (FR)  both lost more than 4
percent as analysts downgraded their shares. Swiss Re gained 1.9
percent after saying smaller losses from natural disasters
helped net income surge in the third quarter. Hermes advanced 2
percent as sales rose because of increased demand in Asia.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.2 percent to 270.58 at
the close in London, after earlier climbing as much as 0.6
percent. The gauge has  rallied 16 percent from this year’s low 
on June 4 as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
he would do everything to protect the single currency and the
 Federal Reserve  opted for a third round of asset purchases.  “I have trouble being very optimistic,” said Matthieu Giuliani, a  fund manager  at Banque Palatine SA in Paris, which
oversees $5.1 billion. “The general tone of company outlooks is
cautious. The situation hasn’t changed fundamentally.”  Of the 229  Stoxx 600 companies  that have reported earnings
this season, about 53 percent have exceeded analysts
projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Some 39
companies in the  equity benchmark  were scheduled to report their
results today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  National benchmark indexes fell in every western-European
market except Portugal and Switzerland. France’s CAC 40
retreated 0.1 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 slid 0.3 percent and
Germany’s DAX lost 0.4 percent.  Greek Austerity  Greece ’s ASE slumped 3.8 percent even as Prime Minister
Antonis Samaras obtained a parliamentary majority for a package
of austerity measures needed to release further financial aid
from the European Union.  The bill on pension, wage and benefit cuts was approved
with 153 votes in favor in the 300-seat Parliament early today,
according to acting speaker Athanasios Nakos. A total of 128
lawmakers voted against the bill, while 18 abstained and one
member was absent.  Stocks declined after an unidentified European Union
official said euro-area finance ministers will delay a decision
on whether to provide further financial aid to Greece.  The ECB left its  benchmark interest rate  at a record low of
0.75 percent, as predicted by all but one of 63 economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Draghi reiterated that the central
bank will buy the debt of countries that ask it to intervene in
their bond markets.  The  Bank of England  held its  key interest rate  at a record
low of 0.5 percent.  Automotive Equities  A gauge of auto-related companies fell 1.4 percent, the
biggest slide among the Stoxx 600’s 19 industry groups. Peugeot

its recommendation for Europe’s second-biggest carmaker to sell
from neutral, citing the company’s struggles with cash.  Valeo declined 4.8 percent to 33.13 euros after UBS AG
downgraded France’s second-largest car-parts maker to neutral
from buy, saying consensus estimates for European auto suppliers
remained too high and all companies will face earnings
downgrades.  Pirelli & Cie. lost 2.8 percent to 8.50 euros after
brokerages including Exane BNP Paribas said the tiremaker may
lower its forecasts. Exane projected sales of 6.1 billion euros
($7.8 billion) in 2012, rather than the current guidance of 6.4
billion euros.  Swiss Re added 1.9 percent to 67.15 Swiss francs after
reporting  third-quarter net income  of $2.18 billion, beating the
 average analyst estimate  of $1.35 billion. The world’s second-
biggest reinsurer said it will consider a special dividend if it
fails to find an alternative way to deploy its excess capital.  Hermes, Siemens  Hermes gained 2 percent to 223.60 euros after the French
maker of Birkin bags and silk scarves said  third-quarter sales 
advanced 24 percent from a year earlier to 848.6 million euros.
The  average of four analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg
had called for 803.8 million euros. Excluding currency swings,
sales rose 16 percent. The company also increased its revenue
growth target for this year.  Siemens AG (SIE)  added 1.8 percent to 80.27 euros after Europe’s
largest engineering company announced that it plans to cut costs
by 5 billion euros as it prepares for lower profit.  Alcatel-Lucent SA surged 12 percent to 88.5 euro cents
after AT&T Inc. said it will invest $14 billion over three
years to improve its telecommunications networks. The  short
interest  on Alcatel is at a one-year high with 16 percent of
shares outstanding, according to Markit as of Nov. 6.  Vallourec Advances  Vallourec SA (VK) , which produces steel pipes for the oil and
