Fortress Credit Corp. bought more
than $2 billion in claims on Bernard L. Madoff’s defunct
brokerage from Rye Select Broad Market Fund LP, according to
filings in federal court in  Manhattan .  Rye, which settled a lawsuit by the Madoff trustee related
to the Ponzi scheme, also assigned unspecified additional
amounts of each of the two claims to Fortress that it was
granted under the settlement agreement, the filings said. Many
Madoff claims that trade are recorded in court with the parties’
names blacked out.  To contact the reporter on this story:
