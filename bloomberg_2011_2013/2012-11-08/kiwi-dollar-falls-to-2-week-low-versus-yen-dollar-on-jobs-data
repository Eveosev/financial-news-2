The  New Zealand dollar  fell to the
lowest in two weeks versus the dollar and yen after the nation’s
 unemployment rate  rose by the most since 1999.  The currency reached almost a two-month low against the
Australian dollar after that nation’s economy added more jobs
than forecast. Gains in the Aussie were limited as global stocks
declined.  New Zealand ’s dollar fell as much as 0.5 percent to 81.45
U.S. cents, the weakest since Oct. 24, before trading at 81.49
in  New York  yesterday. It declined 1.1 percent to 64.79 yen
after touching 64.65, the lowest since Oct. 23. It dropped 0.4
percent to NZ$1.2767 per Aussie after  Australia ’s dollar was little changed at $1.0405 and
weakened 0.7 percent to 82.69 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  declined  1.2 percent and
the MSCI World Index of stocks fell 1 percent.  Statistics New Zealand  said yesterday the nation’s  jobless
rate  increased to 7.3 percent in the three months ended
September, from 6.8 percent in the second quarter.  In Australia, the number of people  employed  rose by 10,700
after a 15,500 gain in September, the statistics bureau said,
compared with the median estimate for an increase of 500 in a
Bloomberg News survey. The jobless rate was unchanged at 5.4
percent.  The Aussie has declined 2.8 percent in the past three
months, the worst performance among the 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The kiwi fell 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
