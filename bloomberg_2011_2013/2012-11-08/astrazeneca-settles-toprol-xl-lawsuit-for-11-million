AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  and affiliates will
pay as much as $11 million to settle claims the company violated
antitrust and consumer-protection laws by keeping generic
versions of the heart drug Toprol XL off the market.  Consumers and other buyers who paid for the drug from 2005
to 2012 may share in the fund by filing claim forms, available
through  www.ToprolSettlement.com , according to a statement today
from law firms including  Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check LLP . A
federal judge will consider approving the settlement and
attorneys’ fees of as much $3.5 million at a March 7 hearing in
Wilmington, Delaware, the lawyers said.  The AstraZeneca defendants denied any wrongdoing, and
agreed to the settlement partly “to avoid further expense,
inconvenience” and uncertainties of protracted litigation, the
London-based company said in court papers.  The case stems from lawsuits filed in 2006 by drug
wholesalers and health and welfare funds contending AstraZeneca
used unfair trade practices, partly by bringing sham patent-
infringement lawsuits against makers of low-cost generics.  About half of the settlement fund will be used to pay
consumer claims and the other half will go toward claims by
insurers and employee-benefit plans, the law firms said.  The case is In re Metroprolol Succinate End-Payor Antitrust
Litigation, 06-cv-71, U.S. District Court, District of  Delaware 
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
