European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  announced a new series of euro banknotes that use an
image from Greek mythology to improve security.  The banknotes featuring Europa, the Phoenician princess
abducted by Zeus who gave the continent its name, will be
introduced gradually over several years, starting with a five-
euro ($6.37) bill in May 2013, Draghi said in Frankfurt today.
Europa will appear in the watermark and hologram on the notes.  Central banks typically redesign their banknotes on a
regular basis to improve security and prevent counterfeiting.
Europa will replace architectural images in the watermark. Using
a face rather than a structure may make it harder for forgers to
produce fakes.  “Portraits have long been used in banknotes around the
world and research has shown that people tend to remember
faces,” Draghi said. “Is there any better figure than Europa
to serve as the new face of the euro?”  The first series of banknotes, launched 10 years ago, will
initially circulate alongside the second series before being
gradually withdrawn and eventually ceasing to be legal tender,
the ECB said. “The date when this occurs will be announced well
in advance,” it said.  Still, the old banknotes will retain their value
indefinitely and can be exchanged at the Eurosystem’s national
central banks at any time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
