Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the world’s largest online retailer, will start selling wines on its website just in time for the  holiday shopping season .  The marketplace, called Amazon Wine, will feature more than 1,000 wines from around the U.S., the Seattle-based company said in a statement. Starting today, Amazon will ship up to six bottles for $9.99 to 12 states and the  District of Columbia .  With its latest foray into wine sales, Amazon is challenging  Wine.com , a San Francisco-based online store founded in 1998 which offers consumers unlimited free shipping for a $49 annual fee. Amazon’s service will let users search for wines by variety, peruse reviews, and see recommendations for food parings.  “Whether it’s helping customers find a favorite varietal, shop for holiday pairings or expand their cellar with a special hand-crafted bottle, we’re excited to provide the right tools and information needed to guide them to the perfect wine,” Peter Faricy, vice president for Amazon Marketplace, said in the statement.  In 2008, Amazon tried to enter the wine market through a partership with New Vine Logistics, which later suspended operations. Previously, the Amazon invested in WineShopper.com, which is now a flash-sale site run by Wine.com.  Amazon’s shares fell 2 percent to $227.35 at the close in  New York . The stock has increased 31 percent this year.
