Banco de Credito del Peru (CREDITC1) , the
country’s largest lender, said it will continue tapping debt
markets in the next two to three years as its loan portfolio
grows faster than deposits.  Increased reserve requirements are also prompting the bank
to seek financing, Alvaro Correa, chief financial officer of
parent company  Credicorp Ltd. (BAP) , said on its third-quarter
conference call today. The lender’s loan portfolio grew 23.7
percent to $19.7 billion at end-September from the year earlier
period, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
