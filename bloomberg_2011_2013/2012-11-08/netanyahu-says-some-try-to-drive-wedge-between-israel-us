Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  responded to criticism from political rivals over his
relationship with President  Barack Obama  after the Democrats
retained control of the White House, saying relations with the
U.S. remain firm.  “In recent days, I have been hearing voices that are
coming from among us that are trying to stir things up between
us and United States,” Netanyahu said at a ceremony in the
coastal city of Ashdod today, according to an e-mailed statement
from his office. “This will not help them. The alliance between
Israel and the United States is strong.”  Ex-Prime Minister  Ehud Olmert  is among political foes who
criticized Netanyahu this week for allegedly favoring Republican
challenger  Mitt Romney  over Obama in the presidential race.  “What took place this time was a breaking of all the
rules, when our prime minister intervened in the U.S.
elections,” Olmert told a meeting of American-Jewish leaders in
New York yesterday, according to a report in the Haaretz daily.  Netanyahu publicly criticized the Obama administration’s
position on Iran in the months before the Nov. 6 election
because it hadn’t set a “red line” on the Islamic Republic’s
nuclear program. The two leaders have also clashed over how to
advance the stalled  peace process  with the Palestinians.  “I will continue to work with President Obama to advance
the vital interests of the State of Israel regarding the
security of Israel’s citizens,” Netanyahu said today.  Israeli elections are scheduled for Jan. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
