Demand for OPEC’s crude will decline
through to 2016 because of the weakening economic outlook and
growing reliance on competing sources such as U.S. shale oil
deposits and natural gas liquids.  Global need for fuel from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will shrink to 29.7 million barrels a day in
2016, 1.4 million less than this year, the group said today in
its annual World Oil Outlook. The estimate for 2015 is 1.6
million barrels lower than that forecast in last year’s report.
OPEC predicts it may have more than 5 million barrels of daily
spare production capacity as early as next year.  “The economic recovery remains fragile, the risks stemming
from the euro zone debt crisis appear to be heightening,
economic growth in major  developing countries  is facing strong
headwinds,” the group’s Vienna-based research department, led
by Hasan Qabazard, said. “Shale oil represents a large change
to the supply picture.”  Brent crude futures have tumbled 16 percent from this
year’s peak, trading at about $107.50 a barrel today, amid
concern that Europe’s failure to resolve its debt turmoil is
hindering the world economy. The U.S. this year is set to
achieve its highest level of energy independence in more than 20
years amid booming oil shale output in North Dakota and  Texas ,
according to the Energy Department.  Global Demand  OPEC reduced estimates for  global consumption  in 2016 by 1
million barrels to 92.9 million a day, meaning demand will
advance by 5.1 million, or 4.7 percent, from last year. Seventy
percent of the increase will come from emerging nations in  Asia ,
while fuel use in developed nations, which peaked in 2005, will
decline by 0.9 percent to 45.7 million a day from this year to
2016, according to the report.  Supplies from outside OPEC will increase in excess of 4
million barrels a day from 2011 to 2016, reaching 56.6 million.
The gain will be driven by output of  U.S. shale oil , Canadian
 oil sands , and crude from the Caspian Sea and Brazil. The
assessment for  non-OPEC supply  to 2015 is 2 million barrels a
day more than in last year’s report.  OPEC’s 12 members will spend $270 billion on 116 projects
to maintain and increase production, boosting total output,
including natural gas liquids, by 5 million barrels a day by
2016. The amount of spare crude capacity may surpass 5 million
daily barrels next year or in 2014.  Fuel Efficiency  The organization also cut its global demand forecast for
2035, the end of the period covered by the report, by 2 million
barrels to 107.3 million a day, as higher prices curb
consumption and cars and ships use fuel more efficiently. OPEC
will need to bolster output by a “modest” 5 million barrels a
day to meet world requirements by 2035, it said.  OPEC still expects its share of global oil will remain
“approximately constant” at 32 percent through to 2035 as it
boosts output of natural gas liquids, or NGLs, and supplies from
gas-to-liquid projects.  The group raised its price assumptions, projecting that
OPEC’s  basket of crudes , a benchmark composed of blends from
each member, will average $100 a barrel through to 2016 and then
climb to $155 by 2035 because of higher costs to bolster
production. The basket averaged $110 this year.  OPEC’s members are  Algeria ,  Angola ,  Ecuador , Iran,  Iraq ,
 Kuwait , Libya,  Nigeria ,  Qatar ,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. They are next scheduled to meet on Dec.
12 in Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
