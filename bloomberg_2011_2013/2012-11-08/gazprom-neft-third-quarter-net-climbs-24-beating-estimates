OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of
 Russia ’s natural gas exporter, climbed the most in a week after
quarterly profit rose 24 percent, beating analyst estimates.  Gazprom Neft rose as much as 1.6 percent, the biggest gain
since Nov. 1, and traded up 1.1 percent at 152.98 rubles by 4:03
p.m. in Moscow. The Micex index fell 0.8 percent to 1,411.76.  The amount of shares traded was 103,530, equivalent to 52
percent of the three-month average. The 10-day volatility jumped
to 21.41, the highest since Oct. 1.  Net income advanced to 56 billion rubles ($1.8 billion)
from 45.3 billion rubles a year earlier, the  St. Petersburg ,
Russia-based company said on its website. That beat the average
estimate of 49.3 billion rubles from five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Revenue gained 23 percent to 333.1 billion rubles.  OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, more than
tripled net income in the third quarter after a loss in the
previous quarter. TNK-BP, the third-largest, also rose as export
taxes lagged crude price increases.  “What we like is that the company is delivering good
results steadily versus its peers,” Ekaterina  Rodina (RODNP) , an oil
and gas analyst at VTB Capital, said today. “Premium sales” of
lubricants and retail products has also increased while costs
have remained unchanged, she said.  Gazprom Neft’s output increased 4.9 percent to 1.18 million
barrels of oil equivalent a day in the period as it started the
SeverEnergia project, a gas and condensate production venture
with  Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Enel SpA (ENEL)  and OAO Novatek in western Siberian.  To contact the reporter on this story:
