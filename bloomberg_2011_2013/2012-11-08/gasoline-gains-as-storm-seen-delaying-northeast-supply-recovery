Gasoline gained on speculation that a
coastal storm that brought snow and flooding to East Coast areas
recovering from  Hurricane Sandy  may delay fuel imports.  Futures rose as the nor’easter pushed a band of snow into
the states around  New York City  and threatened to exacerbate
power outages that have persisted since Sandy struck on Oct. 29
near Atlantic City, New Jersey. Four tankers carrying gasoline
and four transporting naphtha were scheduled to arrive in  New
York  Harbor over the next few days, according to the U.S. Coast
Guard yesterday.  “Supplies in the Northeast are being impacted by the
delayed arrival of tankers because of the nor’easter,”  said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.
“Inventories remain low for this time of the year.”  Gasoline for December delivery rose 2.31 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.612 a gallon at 9:46 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Today’s gain follows yesterday’s 4.1 percent slide on
concern that President Barack Obama and the U.S. Congress won’t
reach a budget deal. Obama, who won re-election on Nov. 6, and
Congress must address a looming $607 billion in automatic
spending cuts and tax gains known as the fiscal cliff. Democrats
retained control of the Senate while Republicans continue to
hold a majority in the  House of Representatives .  “The move down was, maybe, a little bit exaggerated,”
said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in
Chicago.  Storm Recovery  The East Coast, which includes New York Harbor, the
delivery point for the Nymex contract, is recovering from
disruptions caused by Hurricane Sandy. The storm shut retail
stations, terminals, refineries and pipelines, reducing the
ability of drivers to buy fuel.  Inventories of gasoline in the East Coast, or PADD 1, fell
1.25 million barrels last week to 46.6 million, 8.7 percent
below a year earlier, Energy Department data showed.  Total U.S. gasoline imports slid 56 percent to 270,000
barrels a day, the least since December 1999. Shipments of
gasoline into the East Coast, where most cargoes land, sank 63
percent to 217,000 barrels.  December-delivery heating oil advanced 2.24 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.9845 a gallon.  The average nationwide price for  regular gasoline  rose 0.2
cent to $3.464 a gallon, AAA, the largest U.S. motoring
organization, said today on its website. It was the first
increase since Oct. 7. The pump price reached a 2012 high of
$3.936 on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
