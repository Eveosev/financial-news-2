Carlsberg A/S, (CARLB)  the world’s fourth-
largest brewer, and Dutch energy distributor Alliander NV took
advantage of the lowest borrowing costs in 18 months to sell new
bonds.  The beer maker sold 750 million euros ($955 million) of 10-
year debt and added 250 million euros to its existing 2.625
percent bonds due 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It’s the company’s first debt  sale  since July.  The average yield on non-financial European company bonds
fell to 115 basis points more than the safest government debt,
the lowest premium since May 31, 2011, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s EMU Corporates, Non-Financial Index shows. Bond sales
are heading to at least 5.9 billion euros in the region this
week, the most since 7.2 billion euros of debt was sold in the
week ending Oct. 12, Bloomberg data show.  “Appetite for new issues has been strong in recent weeks
so Carlsberg’s deal is a classic,” said Patrick McCullagh, the
head of European credit research at Schroder Investment
Management Ltd. in  London , which oversees $63 billion of bonds.  Arnhem, Netherlands-based Alliander has 2.8 billion euros
of debt outstanding, according to Bloomberg data, and today’s
400 million euros sale of 10-year bonds was its first issue
since June.  Carlsberg Breweries  Copenhagen-based Carlsberg’s 10-year bonds were sold
through its Carlsberg Breweries A/S unit to yield 98 basis
points more than the benchmark midswap rate, from an initially-
marketed 110 basis-point area, according to the person with
knowledge of the sale. That compares with a 118 basis-point
spread on its existing 2019 bonds, Bloomberg data show.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup
Inc. and  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  led the sale.  The pricing “doesn’t look that generous,” CreditSights
analysts told clients in a note. “We would be a holder but not
an aggressive buyer of the new bonds.”  Getinge AB (GETIB) , a Swedish sterilization-systems maker, will
meet European bond investors next week before a potential high-
yield sale, according to a person familiar with the
arrangements.  In derivative markets, the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of
credit-default swaps linked to the debt of 50 mostly junk-rated
European companies rose eight basis points to 533 at 4:05 p.m.
in London, having earlier fallen as much as six basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-default swaps on
125 investment-grade companies rose 1.5 basis points to 131,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The Markit iTraxx
Financial Index of swaps tied to the senior debt of 25 banks and
insurers rose 0.5 basis point to 175.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A basis point on
a contract protecting 10 million euros of debt for five years is
equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
