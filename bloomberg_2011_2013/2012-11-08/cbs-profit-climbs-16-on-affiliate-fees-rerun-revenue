CBS Corp. (CBS) , owner of the most-watched
TV network, said third-quarter profit increased 16 percent,
beating analysts’ estimates on rising income from affiliate fees
and sales of reruns.  Net income rose to $391 million, or 60 cents a share, from
$338 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier,  New York- 
based CBS said yesterday in a  statement . Excluding items, profit
of 65 cents beat the 60-cent average of 27  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales climbed 1.6 percent to $3.42 billion, compared
with the $3.49 billion  average  projection.  To counter swings in ad sales, Chief Executive Officer
Leslie Moonves is seeking fees from pay-TV systems and
affiliates that carry the network. He’s also licensing shows to
digital outlets including  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  and Hulu LLC. Those two
areas led the company’s revenue growth, outpacing ad sales.  “Our base businesses continue to be extremely solid
performers, and at the same time, we’re growing the size of our
overall revenue pie by steadily increasing our non-advertising
revenue,” Moonves said on a conference call. “The fact that we
were able to achieve these results in an economy that is still
recovering is a testament to the remarkable transformation under
way at our company.”  CBS, controlled by Chairman Sumner Redstone, rose 1.1
percent to $35.36 at the close in New York. The shares have
gained 27 percent this year.  With the Super Bowl and a key National Football League
playoff game on the schedule in early 2013, CBS is expected to
lead audience ratings for the ninth time in 10 years when the
current TV season ends in May.  Super Bowl  CBS has sold most of its advertising inventory for the Feb.
3 Super Bowl, with some 30-second commercials fetching more than
$4 million, Moonves said.  The company may begin providing past seasons of programs
that are still on the air to online outlets that include
Amazon.com, Moonves said on the call. The company has limited
such deals to shows that are off the air.  “It is very attractive,” Moonves said, citing the added
income and the potential for higher ratings on the network.  Third-quarter advertising revenue slid 3.1 percent to $1.93
billion, CBS said. NBC aired the summer Olympics during the
quarter, attracting more viewers and ad dollars.  CBS said content licensing and distribution revenue totaled
$931 million in the period, a 7.9 percent increase from a year
earlier, while affiliate and subscription fees climbed 12
percent to $496 million.  Political Ads  The company will recognize the bulk of record political
advertising at its TV and radio stations this quarter, Chief
Financial Officer Joe Ianniello said on the call.  Operating profit at CBS’s local TV and radio stations
climbed 18 percent to $190 million on sales of $661 million.
 Doug Creutz , an analyst at Cowen & Co. in New York, forecast
revenue of $707 million in a Nov. 1 report.  Operating profit at CBS Entertainment, the unit that
includes the network, fell 5.5 percent to $346 million on sales
of $1.68 billion. Creutz expected sales of $1.67 billion.  Profit at CBS’s  cable division  rose 12 percent to $221
million as sales increased 3.8 percent to $436 million. The
unit, which includes the Showtime premium channel, was expected
to report $443 million in revenue, Creutz wrote.  Operating profit at CBS’s outdoor advertising business more
than doubled to $45 million on sales of $486 million, while
profit at the Simon & Schuster publishing unit rose 5.6 percent
to $38 million on revenue of $210 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
