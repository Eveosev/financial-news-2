Soybeans fell to a three-week low
after a government report showed a drop in overseas demand for
supplies from the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter. Corn
declined.  Sales of soybeans in the week ended Nov. 1 plunged 75
percent from a week earlier and corn sales dropped 6.1 percent,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today. The  dollar  rose
to a two-month high against a basket of six currencies after
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said growth will
stay weak. A stronger dollar erodes the appeal of commodities.  “U.S. exports are slowing,” Jacquie Voeks, a senior
market adviser for West Bend, Wisconsin-based Stewart Peterson
Group, said in a telephone interview. “The economic environment
in not conducive for grain market investors.”  Soybean futures for January delivery dropped 0.7 percent to
close at $14.9575 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after touching $14.93, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Oct. 17. The oilseed has fallen 16 percent since
reaching a record $17.89 in September after rains pared yield
losses in the U.S. caused by the worst drought since 1956.  Corn futures for December delivery declined 0.4 percent to
$7.4125 a bushel on the CBOT, after gaining 1.2 percent during
the prior two sessions. Prices have dropped 13 percent since
touching a record $8.49 on Aug. 10 as demand slowed from meat
and fuel producers.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
