Spain  sold 4.76 billion euros ($6.06
billion) of debt, including the longest-maturity security it has
auctioned in more than a year, even as weak demand prompted a
slump in prices after the sale.  The Treasury in Madrid beat its maximum target of 4.5
billion euros. Still, demand for a new five-year benchmark was
1.57 times the amount sold, compared with 2.55 when similar debt
was sold last month, and the yield rose to 4.81 percent after
the auction from an average 4.68 percent at the sale.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is keeping investors guessing
as to whether he will seek a European bailout that would allow
the ECB to start buying Spanish bonds. Central bank policy
makers meet in  Frankfurt  today as Rajoy presses the ECB to go
beyond the rules it has set for itself and say how much it would
intervene to cut borrowing costs if he did ask for help.  “We’re in something of a stalemate, which is fine for now,
but going into 2013 with the new supply, there’s a risk the
market forces Spain into a bailout,”  Harvinder Sian , a senior
fixed income strategist at Royal Bank of  Scotland  in  London .  Yields Rise  Spain’s 10-year benchmark bond yield rose to 5.834 percent
at 11:45 a.m. in Madrid, from 5.693 percent yesterday. That’s
down from a record 7.75 percent on July 25, the day before ECB
President  Mario Draghi  first signalled the bank’s willingness to
intervene in markets when he pledged to do whatever it takes to
defend the euro.  The current five-year benchmark, which matures in July
2017, fell after the auction, pushing the yield to 4.642
percent. The yields on the three-year and 20-year bonds also
surged after the securities were auctioned.  Spain sold 731 million euros of bonds maturing in 2032
today at an average yield of 6.328 percent, compared with 4.777
percent when they were last sold in October 2010. The debt
agency hadn’t sold such long-dated debt since May 2011, when it
placed 30-year bonds.  “Few would have predicted as recently as July that Spain
would be selling 20-year paper this year,” Nicholas Spiro,
managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, said in an e-
mail. “Not only did the Treasury exceed its target today,
helping it fulfil its funding requirements for this year, but it
did this at a time when the Rajoy government is less and less
disposed to apply for a bond-buying program.”  Planned Issuance  The Treasury had already sold 95 percent of its planned
2012 issuance before today’s sale, according to the  Economy
Ministry . Still, Rajoy’s plans may change as the European Union
and private economists expect Spain to miss its deficit target
this year.  The Treasury auctioned three-year bonds at an average yield
of 3.66 percent, compared with 3.956 percent at a sale last
month. Demand for the three-year bonds, which would probably be
targeted in any ECB bond-buying, was 2.83 times the amount sold,
compared with 1.98 last month.  Rajoy, who has been deliberating whether to seek a rescue
for more than three months, said on Nov. 6 he needs to know how
much the nation’s borrowing costs would fall if he asked the ECB
to buy its bonds. It wouldn’t make sense to commit to new
conditions if bond buying didn’t narrow the spread between
Spanish and German 10-year yields, which has already fallen in
the three months since the ECB first announced its plan, he
said.  That gap was at 446 basis points today, down from a record
649.8 basis points on July 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
