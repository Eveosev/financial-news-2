Former U.S. Open champion Juan Martin
Del Potro cruised past Janko Tipsarevic at the ATP World Tour
Finals.  The sixth-seeded player from Argentina defeated the No. 8
seed from Serbia, 6-0, 6-4 at the season-ending championships
for the world’s best tennis players at  London ’s O2 arena.  Six-time champion  Roger Federer  of Switzerland earlier
today booked a spot in the semi-finals with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) win
against Spain’s  David Ferrer . Del Potro had been beaten by
Ferrer in three sets in his first group match.  The ATP Finals start with a round-robin format, dividing
the world’s top eight singles players and doubles pairs
into two groups of four, with the top two in each section moving
into the single elimination semifinal stage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
