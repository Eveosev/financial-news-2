Sotheby’s (BID)  said its third-quarter loss
widened by 10 percent, due to an unfavorable comparison with the
year-ago quarter because of a tax benefit.  The publicly traded art auctioneer lost $32.6 million, or
48 cents a share, compared with a loss of $29.7 million, or 44
cents a share, it said in a statement. The loss was in keeping
with the 49-cent average loss forecast by six analysts.  Quarterly revenue increased 18 percent to $68.5 million.
The auction house realized an $11.6 million tax benefit in the
third quarter of 2011.  Sotheby’s shares are up 6 percent this year, less than the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s 10 percent advance. The results
were released after the close of regular trading.  The auction house typically posts a small loss or profit in
the first and third quarters. The biggest auctions are held in
the second and fourth quarters. Its  New York  Impressionist and
modern art sale is scheduled for tonight.  “Sotheby’s continues to see considerable demand for
precious works of art,” Chief Executive Officer Bill Ruprecht
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter of this story:
