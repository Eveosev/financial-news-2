The following is the text of
 Canada ’s international merchandise trade report for September
from  Statistics Canada .  Canada’s merchandise exports rose 1.9% and imports were
unchanged in September. As a result, Canada’s trade deficit with
the world narrowed from $1.5 billion in August to $826 million
in September.  Exports rose to $38.0 billion, as prices increased 1.9%.
Exports of energy products led the overall gain.  Imports remained at $38.8 billion in September. Overall,
the increase in volumes offset the decrease in prices. Metal and
non-metallic mineral products registered the largest increase in
total value of imports, while consumer goods posted the largest
decline.  Exports to the United States grew 1.3% to $27.8 billion, on
higher exports of aircraft and other transportation equipment
and parts. Imports from the  United States  edged up 0.5% to $24.3
billion. As a result, Canada’s trade surplus with the United
States rose from $3.2 billion in August to $3.5 billion in
September.  Exports to countries other than the United States increased
3.6% to $10.2 billion, while imports were down 0.8% to $14.5
billion. Consequently, Canada’s trade deficit with countries
other than the United States narrowed from $4.8 billion in
August to $4.3 billion in September.  Energy products section leads the increase in exports  Exports of energy products rose 4.2% to $8.4 billion in
September, as prices increased 4.2%. Leading the gain were
exports of crude oil and crude bitumen, up 9.5%. Other energy
products, mainly coal, also contributed to the increase. Refined
petroleum energy products partially offset the overall increase
with lower exports of  diesel fuel  and motor gasoline.  Exports of farm, fishing and intermediate food products
grew 14.4% to a record high of $2.3 billion in September, as
volumes increased. Following three consecutive monthly declines,
exports of canola were up 81.9% to $457 million, contributing
the most to the increase.  Exports of aircraft and other transportation equipment and
parts rose 17.9% to $1.7 billion, on higher exports of aircraft
(+37.7%), mainly to the United States. Overall volumes increased
18.4%.  Exports of metal ores and non-metallic minerals posted a
17.4% increase to $1.6 billion in September. A 46.4% increase in
metal ores and concentrates contributed the most to the gain in
the section, mainly on exports of copper ores and concentrates.  Exports of metal and non-metallic mineral products fell
4.1% to $4.3 billion, as a result of lower volumes outpacing
higher prices. Widespread decreases in exports were recorded in
September, with unwrought nickel and nickel alloys posting the
largest decline. Exports of unwrought precious metals and
precious metal alloys partially offset the overall decrease as
both prices and volumes rose.  Imports are unchanged  Imports of metal and non-metallic mineral products rose
8.4% to $3.7 billion in September. Imports of unwrought precious
metals and precious metal alloys led the gain, as volumes
increased (+42.4%).  Imports of basic and industrial chemical, plastic and
rubber products increased 6.5% to $3.2 billion, on higher
volumes (+11.7%). Imports of lubricants and other petroleum
refinery products contributed the most to the gain, partially
offset by lower imports of basic chemicals, primarily
pharmaceutical chemicals.  Imports of  consumer goods  fell 3.0% to $7.5 billion, as a
result of widespread decreases in volumes. The section recorded
its third consecutive monthly decline in imports. A 10.1%
decline in imports of pharmaceutical and medicinal products
contributed the most to the overall decrease.  Imports of motor vehicles and parts, down for a third month
in a row, declined 2.5% to $6.7 billion in September, as volumes
and prices declined. The principal contributor behind the
overall decrease was imports of passenger cars and light trucks,
falling 6.6% to $2.6 billion.  Note to readers  Merchandise trade is one component of Canada’s
international balance of payments (BOP), which also includes
trade in services, investment income, current transfers as well
as capital and financial flows.  International merchandise trade data by country are
available on both a BOP and a customs basis for the United
States,  Japan  and the  United Kingdom . Trade data for all other
individual countries are available on a customs basis only. BOP
data are derived from customs data by making adjustments for
factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These
adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions
of the Canadian System of National Accounts.  Data in this release are on a BOP basis, seasonally
adjusted and in current dollars. Constant dollars are calculated
using the Laspeyres volume formula.  For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal
adjustment and identifying economic trends
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010-x/2010003/part-partie3 -
eng.htm) .  New aggregation structure and other updates  Changes were applied to the international merchandise trade
data series. The published data are now based on the North
American Product Classification System
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/subjects-sujets/standard-norme/napcs -
scpan/notice-avis/napcs-scpan-02-eng.htm) (NAPCS) 2007. The
price indexes are now based on 2007 as the base year and the
weighting methods for price measures have been revised. In
addition, a new version of the software, X-12-ARIMA, is being
used for seasonal adjustment.  The old CANSIM tables 228-0001 to 228-0003, 228-0033, 228-
0034, 228-0041 to 228-0043 and 228-0047 to 228-0057 were
replaced by tables 228-0058 to 228-0068.  Revisions  In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an
ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current year
revisions are reflected in both the customs and BOP based data.
Revised data based on NAPCS for the reference period from
January 1988 to August 2012 were disseminated on October 18.  The previous year’s customs data are revised with the
release of the January and February reference months as well as
on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs based
data are revised annually and are released in February with the
December reference month.  Factors influencing revisions include late receipt of
import and export documentation, incorrect information on
customs forms, replacement of estimates produced for the energy
sector with actual figures, changes in classification of
merchandise based on more current information, and changes to
seasonal adjustment factors.  Revised data are available in the appropriate CANSIM tables,
free of charge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
