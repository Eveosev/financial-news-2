Greece  will sell 500,000 European
Union carbon permits in an additional auction to be held on Nov.
19, according to the Athens exchange, which is in charge of
hosting the sales.  The country had scheduled four sales to be held on each
Wednesday in November. The extra sale was scheduled after “the
government gave us more permits, which we need to sell,”
Alexandra Grispou, a spokeswoman for the exchange, said by phone
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
