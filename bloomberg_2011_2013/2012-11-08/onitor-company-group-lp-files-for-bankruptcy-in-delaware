Monitor Company Group LP, the
Cambridge, Massachusetts consulting firm that last year
apologized for helping to improve the image of former Libyan
dictator  Muammar Qaddafi , filed for bankruptcy protection.  The company, in a Chapter 11 petition filed yesterday in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware, listed assets and
debt of $100 million to $500 million each.  Monitor Group  said in a statement that its U.S. business 
would be aquired by Deloitte Consulting LLP while its 
practices outside the U.S. will be acquired by other member 
firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd.  Monitor Group was co-founded in 1983 by Michael Porter, the
Harvard Business School management expert. Politico reported on
Feb. 21, 2011, that the Qaddafi regime paid the company a fee of
$3 million a year, plus expenses, to run what the firm called
“a sustained, long-term program to enhance international
understanding and appreciation of Libya.”  The case is In re Monitor Company Group LP, 12-13042,  U.S.
