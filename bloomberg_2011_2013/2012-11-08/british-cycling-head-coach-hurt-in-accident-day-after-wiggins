Shane Sutton, head coach of the
British Cycling team, suffered brain injuries in a bike
accident, a day after  Tour de France  champion Bradley Wiggins
hurt his ribs when he was knocked off his bicycle.  Sutton was involved in an incident this morning in a road
in Manchester, northwest England, and was taken to the hospital,
where he’ll remain the next few days, British Cycling said today
in an e-mailed  statement . The coach, who was wearing a helmet,
will undergo additional tests in the next few days.  “It is extremely rare that our riders and coaches are hurt
while out cycling on the road, even rarer that two incidents
should occur in a short space of time, and we wish Shane and
Bradley a speedy recovery,” British Cycling said in the
statement.  Wiggins, 32, was taken to the hospital last night following
a collision with a vehicle near his home in Eccleston, also in
northwest  England . He was released today with minor injuries,
including bruised ribs and hand, Team Sky said on its  website .  Wiggins “is expected to make a full and speedy recovery,”
Richard Freeman, Team Sky’s doctor, said. “He is now going to
spend the weekend at home convalescing with his family.”  Wiggins became the first British winner of the Tour de
 France , cycling’s most prestigious race, on July 22. Ten days
later, he won his fourth Olympic gold medal with a victory in
the men’s time trial at the London Games.  Sutton, who is Australian, is also head coach at Team Sky.
He joined British Cycling in 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
