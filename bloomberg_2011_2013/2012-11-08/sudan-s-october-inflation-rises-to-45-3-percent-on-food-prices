Sudan ’s inflation rate increased to
45.3 percent in October, the highest in a year, from 41.6
percent a month earlier after food prices increased, the  Central
Bureau of Statistics  said.  The cost of food and drink, the biggest component in the
consumer-price index, increased in 13 out of 17 states, the
Khartoum-based agency said today in an e-mailed statement.  Finance Minister Ali Mahmoud Abdel Rasoul said in December
last year that Sudan was targeting an inflation rate of less
than 17 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
