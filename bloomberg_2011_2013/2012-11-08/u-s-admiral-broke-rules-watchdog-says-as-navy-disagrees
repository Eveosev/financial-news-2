The Pentagon’s inspector general said
the admiral who heads the U.S. European Command violated travel
and gift rules, while the Navy said there was no “personal
misconduct.”  Admiral James Stavridis on one occasion used military
aircraft for unofficial travel without obtaining approval,
accepted gifts from foreign governments without reporting or
disposing of them, and let family members travel with him on
military aircraft without reimbursing the government at full
coach fares, according to a report by the Defense Department’s
inspector general released today.  Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said most of the incidents cited
resulted from “shortcomings in administrative procedures” that
have since been corrected. Mabus disputed a finding that
Stavridis used a military aircraft for unofficial purposes on a
2010 trip from  Belgium  to Burgundy,  France , saying the trip had
“strategic value.”  “I have determined that Admiral Stavridis never attempted
to use his public office for private gain, nor did he commit
personal misconduct,” Mabus wrote in memo explaining his
resolution of the case.  Mabus said he discussed with Stavridis “the several
process failures documented in this investigation” and stressed
the importance of following standard protocols for all gifts,
travel by family members and the use of government cellular
phones.  Stavridis, a former head of U.S. Southern Command, took
over the European Command in 2009. He also serves as NATO’s
supreme allied commander for  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
