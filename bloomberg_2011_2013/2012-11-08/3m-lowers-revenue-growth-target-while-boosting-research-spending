3M Co. (MMM)  Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin cut his predecessor’s target for annual sales growth at
the maker of tape and dental braces as he puts his stamp on the
company’s strategy for the next five years.  The new goal is to increase revenue 4 percent to 6 percent
a year at existing businesses, Thulin said today. That’s a
reduction from the 7 percent to 8 percent sought by predecessor
 George Buckley  in 2009. Thulin, who took the helm in February,
said research outlays will rise to 6 percent of sales by 2017,
from 5.3 percent in 2011.  “Innovation is at the center of our plan, so it is
essential that we strengthen our commitment to R&D,” said
Thulin, who in June called Buckley’s sales goal a “stretch
target.”  Europe ’s recession and  Asia ’s slowing economies have hurt
sales, forcing 3M to pare its 2012 earnings forecast last month.
Thulin is shrinking costs and adding units to focus on mining,
energy and aerospace to spur growth at the  St. Paul , Minnesota-
based manufacturer. He said today businesses, which together
have a total of $2.5 billion in sales, are under strategic
review to either be fixed, scaled up, sold or closed.  Thulin’s five-year revenue growth goal would outpace an
average of 3 percent from 2003 to 2012. Developing markets will
drive the expansion, with sales in those regions rising to 40
percent to 45 percent of 3M’s total sales by 2017 from 35
percent in 2012, Thulin said.  “The re-basing of the organic growth targets looks more
realistic,” Steve Tusa, a New York-based analyst with JPMorgan
Chase & Co., said in a note today. Tusa has a neutral rating on
the stock. “We like the re-focus on R&D.”  China Sales Growth  Sales in  China  will rise to as much as $5 billion by 2017
from $2.2 billion this year. In  Latin America , sales will
increase to as much as $5 billion from $2.6 billion in 2012.
Sales to the mining, oil and gas industries will double to $2
billion over the next five years, he said.  The company expects to make about $1 billion to $2 billion
of  acquisitions  a year that will add about 1 to 3 percentage
points to annual sales growth. Acquisitions will only
“complement” sales from existing businesses and aren’t a major
growth strategy, Thulin said.  3M last month agreed to pay $860 million for  Ceradyne Inc. (CRDN) ,
a maker of ceramics used in energy, aerospace and defense
industries. The company also scrapped a $550 million agreement
to acquire the office-products unit of  Avery Dennison Corp. (AVY) 
because of U.S. Justice Department opposition.  Review Process  Thulin, who joined 3M in 1979 and rose through the
company’s health business, declined to say which businesses are
included his review process to fix or shed. He said they are all
profitable even as they have declined 1.5 percent annually for
the last four years.  “The question we look at is: ‘How do you fix that or do
you do something different?’ ” Thulin said. “It’s not an
urgent thing, but it will be done I can promise you that.”  3M set a goal of annual  earnings per share  growth of 9
percent to 11 percent for the next five years and said return on
invested capital will be more than 20 percent. That’s compared
with average annual earnings per share growth of 11 percent and
return on invested capital of 22 percent from 2003 to 2012.  The company’s earnings will be helped by less cash
contributions to its  retirement plan , which are expected to
decline by 50 percent over the five-year period, and lower
taxes. Stock repurchases are expected to be $7.5 billion to $15
billion over the period.  3M  fell  0.9 percent to $88.55 at the close in  New York . The
shares have gained 8.3 percent this year, compared to an advance
of 9.5 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
