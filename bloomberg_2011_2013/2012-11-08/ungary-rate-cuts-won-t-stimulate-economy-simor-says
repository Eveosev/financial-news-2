Hungary ’s central bank can’t provide
strong economic stimulus by cutting interest rates as a weaker
forint hurts households saddled with foreign-currency debt, said
 Andras Simor , the bank’s president.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank’s primary responsibility is to
achieve and maintain price stability, Simor wrote in an article
for the Budapest-based weekly newspaper  HVG  published today.
While the central bank should also try to support the growth and
stability of the economy, monetary policy is constrained by
above-target inflation and the foreign-currency debt of
households, Simor said.  The bank last week cut its main rate 25 basis points to
6.25 percent, a third consecutive reduction. Hungary’s improved
risk assessment and the 3 percent inflation target remaining
within reach by 2014 provide room for further easing, central
bankers Andrea Bartfai-Mager, Ferenc Gerhardt and Gyorgy
Kocziszky said in an interview on Nov. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
