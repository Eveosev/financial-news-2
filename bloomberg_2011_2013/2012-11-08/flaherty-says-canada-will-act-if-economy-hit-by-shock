The Canadian government would be
pragmatic and respond if the country’s economy goes into
recession stemming from an external shock, Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  said.  Appearing in front of the House of Commons Finance
Committee, Flaherty said he doesn’t want to cut spending in a
dramatic way as Canada moves to eliminate its budget deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
