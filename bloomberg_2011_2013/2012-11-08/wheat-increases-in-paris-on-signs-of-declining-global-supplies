Wheat rose to a five-week high on
speculation that the U.S. government will reduce its estimate of
global stockpiles estimate in a report tomorrow as output drops
in Russia and  France , Europe’s biggest grower.  Global inventories before next year’s harvest in the
Northern Hemisphere will total 171.5 million metric tons, less
than last month’s forecast of 173 million, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. France cut its production outlook, and
dry weather is threatening the crop in Russia, last year’s
third-biggest exporter behind the U.S. and Australia.  “People are saying there’s going to be a drop in world
ending stocks,”  Tom Leffler , the owner of Leffler Commodities
LLC in Augusta, Kansas, said by telephone. “That has everybody
worked up.” The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will issue its
monthly crop report tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. in Washington.  Wheat futures for December delivery gained 0.9 percent to
$9.0225 a bushel at 10:37 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
after touching $9.0325, the highest since Oct. 1. On NYSE Liffe
in Paris, milling wheat for January delivery rose 0.7 percent to
277.5 euros ($352.54) a ton, after reaching a record 278 euros.  FranceAgriMer, the government crops office, today cut its
domestic production outlook to 35.8 million tons, from a
previous forecast at 36 million. About 20 percent to 25 percent
of winter grain in  Russia ’s main growing regions may be lost as
seeds haven’t yet sprouted after dry weather, the Moscow-based
Institute for Agricultural Market Studies said today.  U.S. winter wheat was in the worst condition in 27 years as
of Nov. 4 because of drought, Department of Agriculture data
show. Little or no rain has fallen in parts of the southern
Great Plains in the past 30 days, National Weather Service data
show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
