United Co. Rusal shareholder Oleg
Deripaska resumption of talks with Vladimir Potanin on managing
OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel (MNOD)  is positive for  Russia ’s biggest mining
company, according to billionaire investor  Viktor Vekselberg .  “The conflict is destructive and harms business from both
sides; it’s absurd,” Vekselberg said in an interview in Moscow
today. “I don’t insist on a specific decision.”  Vekselberg and his business partner Len Blavatnik control
15.8 percent of Rusal through their Sual Partners Ltd. venture.  The billionaire quit as Rusal’s chairman in March, citing a
“deep crisis” at the aluminum producer after Deripaska
rejected offers to sell the company’s 25 percent stake in
Norilsk. Deripaska said at the time there wasn’t “even a
shallow crisis at Rusal.” In April, as the conflict
intensified, Sual filed for arbitration in  London , claiming its
partners in Rusal breached a 2007 shareholder agreement as they
signed trading contracts with its consent.  Deripaska and Potanin, whose Interros Holding controls 28
percent in Norilsk, resumed talks last month to resolve the
conflict, people with the knowledge of the situation said last
week. The negotiations also cover an increase in dividend
payments from Norilsk, which would help Rusal manage its own
debt burden, the people said.  The dividend policy of any company should depend on its
strategy, and the question should be decided “rationally,”
Vekselberg said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
