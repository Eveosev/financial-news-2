Yields on Treasury 30-year bonds
increased from almost a four-week low before the U.S. sells $16
billion of the securities amid speculation the Federal Reserve’s
efforts to stimulate the economy may lead to inflation.  Long-bond yields fell yesterday the most in 11 weeks as
President  Barack Obama ’s re-election fueled speculation the Fed
will keep buying bonds and as the approach of the so-called
fiscal cliff of U.S. spending cuts and tax increases spurred
demand for safety. Two note auctions earlier this week drew
lower demand than previous sales.  “Treasuries had a big run yesterday,” said  David Coard ,
head of fixed-income trading in New York at Williams Capital
Group, a brokerage for institutional investors. “The longer end
is weaker, but we do have 30-year bonds to sell.”  The  30-year bond  yield was little changed at 2.83 percent
at 11:06 a.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. It fell earlier to 2.81 percent after reaching 2.80
percent yesterday, the lowest level since Oct. 12. Its nine
basis-point drop yesterday was the biggest daily loss since Aug.
22. The price of the 2.75 percent security due in August 2042
lost 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 98 11/32.  Ten-year note  yields  slipped one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.67 percent. They fell 10 basis points
yesterday to 1.65 percent.  Costly Securities  U.S. government securities traded at the most expensive
levels in more than three weeks. The 10-year term premium, a
model created by economists at the  Federal Reserve  that includes
expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation, was
negative 0.89 percent, the most costly since Oct. 15. A negative
reading indicates investors are willing to accept yields below
what’s considered fair value. The average this year is negative
0.76 percent.  The fiscal cliff comprises $600 billion of tax increases
and spending cuts scheduled to take effect automatically next
year unless Congress acts.  The Fed purchased $2.3 trillion of Treasuries and mortgage-
related bonds in two rounds of quantitative-easing stimulus from
2008 to 2011 and has begun a third effort. The central bank
announced Sept. 13 it would buy $40 billion a month of mortgage-
backed securities until the outlook for the labor market
improves “substantially.”  The central bank is also swapping shorter-maturity
Treasuries in its holdings with those due in six to 30 years as
part of its efforts to put downward pressure on long-term
borrowing costs.  The central bank bought $4.89 billion of Treasuries today
due from November 2020 to August 2022 today as part of the
program, according to the Fed Bank of  New York .  Today’s Auction  The bonds scheduled for sale today yielded 2.845 percent in
pre-auction trading, down from 2.904 percent at last month’s
sale. That compares with a  record-low  auction yield of 2.58
percent on July 12.  At the previous 30-year auction on Oct. 11, the bid-to-
cover ratio, a gauge of demand that compares the amount bid with
the amount sold, was 2.49, versus 2.68 times in September.  Today’s 30-year auction should go well, as “investors
still need duration and yield and look for rates to stay low
with Obama winning a second term,” Justin Lederer, an interest-
rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York, which as
one of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers is obliged to bid in U.S.
debt auctions, wrote in a note to clients. “We expect decent
demand for the long end.”  Indirect Bidders  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 26.5 percent of the bonds at the
October sale, the smallest share since August 2011, versus 38.7
percent at the September auction. The average for the past 10
offerings is 32.6 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 14.2 percent of
the securities at last month’s sale, less than the average 14.4
percent at the past 10 auctions.  Thirty-year bonds have returned 4.3 percent, this year,
compared with a 2.4 percent gain in the broader U.S. Treasuries
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Today’s long-bond sale takes place after demand fell at
both a $24 billion  10-year auction  yesterday and a $32 billion
three-year offering on Nov. 6. Investors bid for 2.59 times the
amount of securities available yesterday, versus 3.26 times at
the previous 10-year auction in October. For the  three-year
sale , the figure dropped to 3.41, from 3.96 a month earlier.  Thirty-year bonds will yield 2.89 percent at year-end and
3.13 percent by the end of June, according to a Bloomberg survey
of banks and securities companies with the most recent
projections given the heaviest weightings. Ten-year notes will
yield 1.73 percent by Dec. 31 and 2.03 percent by June 30, the
forecasts say.  Jobless Claims  Fewer Americans than forecast filed claims for  unemployment
insurance  last week as the effects of  Hurricane Sandy  started to
show up. Applications for  jobless benefits  fell by 8,000 to
355,000 in the week ended Nov. 3, the Labor Department said
today in  Washington . A Bloomberg News survey had forecast claims
for jobless benefits increased by 2,000 to 365,000 last week.  “Jobless claims are likely to be distorted by the
hurricane impact, so people are likely to dismiss any unexpected
drop there,”  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT
Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said before the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
