The  National Hockey League  and its
players’ union will meet today for the fourth time in five days
as they attempt to reach an agreement to end a lockout that
started Sept. 16.  “We look forward to resuming talks tomorrow,” Don Fehr,
executive director of the National Hockey League Players’
Association, said last night in a statement.  Until this week, talks that focused on economic issues such
as revenue sharing and players’ salaries had been stalled since
Oct. 18.  NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said the substance of the
latest talks will not be made public until there is a conclusion
to the labor dispute.  The deadline passed for the league to schedule a full
regular season, which was set to start Oct. 11. The league
locked out its players on Sept. 16, the day after the old
collective bargaining agreement expired.  A total of 327 regular-season games through Nov. 30 have
been canceled, including the annual outdoor Winter Classic. That
game, between the  Detroit Red Wings  and the  Toronto Maple Leafs 
and scheduled for Jan. 1 at Michigan Stadium in  Ann Arbor , was
called off last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
