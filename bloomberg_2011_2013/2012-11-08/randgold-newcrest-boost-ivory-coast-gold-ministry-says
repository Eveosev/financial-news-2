Gold production in Ivory Coast is
forecast to increase 35 percent next year with  Randgold
Resources Ltd. (RRS)  and  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM)  leading the growth,
according to the Finance Ministry.  Output of the metal will climb to 20.1 metric tons from
14.9 tons this year, a document obtained from the Abidjan-based
ministry, which is yet to be publicly released, shows. Randgold
operates the Tongon mine in northern Ivory Coast and Newcrest
produces gold in the central region of Bonikro.  The West African nation, the world’s biggest cocoa
producer, is forecasting a second consecutive year of economic
growth in 2013 after a post-election crisis led to a 4.7 percent
contraction last year. The biggest economy in the region’s
eight-member currency union will expand 9 percent next year,
government spokesman Bruno Kone said on Oct. 2. Growth this year
is projected to be 8.6 percent, according to the International
Monetary Fund.  Output of cocoa will be little changed at 1.4 million tons
in 2013 from 1.39 million tons this year, according to the
document. Crude-oil production is projected to rise 11 percent
to 29,260 barrels a day, while manganese output will jump 82
percent to 500,000 tons in the year, the document showed.  Charles Koffi Diby, the country’s finance minister, didn’t
answer calls made to his mobile phone.  Coffee production in Ivory Coast, which jumped following
the end of the post-election crisis, is forecast to drop 26
percent to 90,000 tons, according to the document. No reason was
given for the decline. The country produces mainly the robusta
variety, which is used in instant coffee.  Rubber output is seen rising 14 percent to 274,500 tons
while palm-oil production will be up 10 percent to 429,000 tons,
according to the ministry’s figures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
