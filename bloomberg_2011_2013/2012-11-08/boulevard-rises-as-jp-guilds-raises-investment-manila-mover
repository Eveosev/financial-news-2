Boulevard Holdings Inc. (BHI)  rose the most
this month as JP Guilds Inc. raised its investment in the
Philippine hotel and resorts developer to 200 million pesos
($4.87 million).  Shares of Boulevard advanced 8.6 percent to 16.4 centavos
as of the noon break in Manila, poised for the sharpest gain
since Oct. 29. The stock advanced as much as 9.9 percent
earlier. The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 0.3
percent.  JP Guilds bought 466.85 million Boulevard shares at 21.42
centavos each, the second tranche of its investment in the
builder, according to a stock-exchange filing today. JP Guilds
paid 100 million pesos in February for a similar number of
shares at the same price, and has until May 31 to invest another
100 million pesos on the same terms, Boulevard said.  Boulevard said today it will use the money to boost its
stake in resort operator Friday’s Holdings Inc. and Friday’s
Puerto Galera Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
