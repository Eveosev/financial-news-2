German 10-year bonds were little
changed after the European Central Bank kept its benchmark
 interest rate  at a record-low 0.75 percent.  Two-year note yields were within three basis points of the
lowest level in almost three months. The decision to keep the
rate on hold was forecast by all but one of 63 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. ECB President Mario Draghi is due to hold
a press conference at 2:30 p.m. in  Frankfurt  to explain the
decision. Spanish 10-year bonds dropped for a second day after
the nation sold 4.76 billion euros ($6.06 billion) of three-,
five- and 20-year securities.  “Even though we don’t get a cut from the ECB this time, I
suspect the language at the press conference will reflect the
fact that forward-looking indicators have been quite weak,
unemployment keeps rising and bank lending remains poor,” said
 Luca Jellinek , the head of European interest-rate strategy at
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “Yields
on core-nation bonds are likely to remain low.”  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield added less than one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.39 percent at 12:54 p.m.
London time, after falling to 1.36 percent, the  lowest  level
since Sept. 3. The 1.5 percent security due in September 2022
declined 0.075, or 75 euro cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to
101.015.  The nation’s two-year notes yielded minus 0.03 percent. The
rate fell to minus 0.055 percent yesterday, the least since Aug.
13. A negative yield means investors who hold the security until
it matures will receive less than they paid to buy it.  German bonds returned 3.9 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spain’s
bonds rose 2.8 percent.  The German 10-year rate was little changed and similar-
maturity Spanish yields climbed nine basis points when the ECB
left rates unchanged on Oct. 4 and Draghi said policy makers
didn’t discuss cutting interest rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
