Klaus Regling, the head of  Europe ’s
rescue funds, said some of the loans extended to troubled euro-
region countries may not be paid back and noted creditors are
taking on risks in the case of Greece.  Perceptions in Germany and other euro countries that
taxpayer money is given away freely to aid recipients and that
the European Central Bank will tolerate surging inflation in the
aftermath of the crisis are wrong, he said.  “These are loans that are paid back, at least
predominantly,” Regling said at a panel discussion in Hamburg
today. “Risks are being taken, also in the case of Greece there
are risks.”  While the European Stability Mechanism is set up like the
 International Monetary Fund , which always got its money back in
the past, there are examples of IMF program countries struggling
to repay their loans, Regling later told  Bloomberg News . Greece
is a “special case,” Regling said, without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
