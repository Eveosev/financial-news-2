TMX Group Inc. (X) , owner of the Toronto
Stock Exchange, may see its revenue affected if securities
regulators make changes on how fees for providing market data
are regulated, said Geoffrey Kwan, an analyst with  RBC Capital
Markets .  The Canadian Securities Administrators is seeking comments
on a paper it released today outlining issues related to the
cost of market data, and whether further steps should be taken
to address fees charged for providing such information.  “Some potential outcomes could include a reduction of the
current fees TMX charges subscribers, limitations on the ability
to increase pricing going forward, or perhaps a prescribed
formula where market data revenues for the industry will be
distributed to exchanges/ATS’ based on a certain metric,” Kwan
said today in a note.  TMX had about C$100 million ($100 million) in fees from
equity market data users in 2011, or 15 percent of the Toronto-
based company’s annual revenue, Kwan said. He forecasts almost
C$120 million in revenue for 2013 could be affected by such
reforms.  “The potential for regulating equity market data fees in
 Canada  is not a new development although this announcement is a
more formal step evaluating the potential for reform in market
data fees,” said Kwan, who rates TMX “sector perform”.  To contact the reporter on this story:
