Gasoline shipments to the U.S. from
 Europe  are poised to fall after inventories of the auto fuel
swelled because of distribution difficulties caused by
superstorm Sandy, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Traders and oil companies booked 13 tankers for the two
weeks to Nov. 21 and another 11 probably will be hired,
according to the median estimate in a survey of six shipbrokers
and traders who specialize in transporting gasoline. The total
number is two fewer than last week.  The storm flooded fuel terminals on the U.S. East Coast,
curbed deliveries and left many filling stations without power
and unable to run pumps. “Restricted” distribution capacity
spurred higher oil-product inventories, according to a report
from  BNP Paribas SA. (BNP)  Operations were limited at all  New York 
Harbor terminals, spokeswoman Emily Mir said by e-mail Nov. 6.  “If traders send too much there, the U.S. infrastructure
won’t be able to cope with it,” Ehsan Ul-Haq, senior market
consultant at KBC Energy Economics in Walton-on-Thames,  England ,
said by phone today. “It’s not certain whether it can all be
taken to consumers.”  U.S. gasoline  inventories  rose by 2.87 million barrels, the
most in 15 weeks, to 202.4 million barrels for the week ended
Nov. 2, according to the  Department of Energy .  Long Island  As many as 70 percent of stations in  New Jersey  were
selling fuel on Nov. 6, according to the AAA, the largest U.S.
motoring organization, compared with as few as 35 percent five
days earlier. Rates were as high as 75 percent in  New York City 
and 65 percent on  Long Island , the AAA said.  The East Coast accounts for a third of U.S. gasoline demand
at about 3 million barrels a day, according to RS Platou Markets
AS, the investment-banking unit of  Norway ’s largest shipbroker.  Tankers plying the trans-Atlantic route are earning $5,871
daily, figures from the London-based Baltic Exchange showed.
Returns plunged 72 percent from the start of this year.  About 39 vessels probably will be available for the voyage,
four fewer than last week, the survey showed.  The 24 ships booked or probably hired over the next two
weeks, called Medium-Range tankers, would be able to carry
888,000 metric tons of gasoline, or 539,000 barrels a day. The
survey is based on so-called single-voyage, or spot, charters
and excludes loadings under longer-term contracts. It assumes
shipments to the U.S. East Coast from northwestern Europe. Each
tanker would normally haul about 37,000 tons of gasoline, or
315,000 barrels.  Following is a table of ships chartered and those probably
hired for the trans-Atlantic voyage loading over the two-week
periods from the dates shown. The table also displays the number
of ships available to be booked.  *T                              Nov. 7    Oct. 31     Change
