Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  Canada ’s
largest insurer, delayed its objective of reaching C$4 billion
($4 billion) in annual profit, citing “significant headwinds”
in the economy.  The owner of Boston-based John Hancock Financial expects to
have C$4 billion in so-called core earnings by 2016 after
previously stating a net income target of C$4 billion in 2015,
the company said today as it reported a narrower third-quarter
loss. The Toronto-based insurer said in August that the
worsening economy would make it hard to reach the 2015 target.  “It’s a reasonable guesstimate on our part,” Chief
Executive Officer Donald Guloien said today in a telephone
interview. “It’s got some ambition in it, but it’s not a worst-
case scenario.”  The third-quarter loss shrank to C$227 million, or 14 cents
a share, from C$1.28 billion, or 73 cents, a year earlier.
Manulife posted investment gains as Canada’s benchmark Standard
& Poor’s/TSX Composite Index advanced 5.7 percent and the  S&P
500 Index  rose 2.4 percent during the period. Insurers benefit
from increased investment income when equities rise.  Manulife fell 1.5 percent to C$11.82 in 4 p.m. trading on
the Toronto Stock Exchange. It has risen 8.9 percent this year.  Hedging Targets  Guloien has lowered Manulife’s sensitivity to equity
markets and  interest rates . He said today that Manulife’s
hedging targets have been achieved two years before a 2014 goal.  Including a C$1 billion charge to reflect changes in the
company’s assumptions to calculate benefits and other one-time
items, the loss was 14 cents a share. That beat the 30 cent a
share loss  estimate  of nine analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Earnings from Canada dropped 12 percent to C$229 million as
wealth-management sales declined. U.S. earnings increased 11
percent to C$288 million and profit from  Asia  climbed 4.5
percent to C$230 million.  Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) , Canada’s third-largest insurer,
reported yesterday third-quarter profit of C$383 million, or 64
cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of C$621
million, or C$1.07. Results topped analyst expectations,
bolstered by fees from its MFS mutual fund unit in the U.S.  “There’s a number of things coming through, but overall
I’d say the strategy is working,” Sun Life CEO Dean Connor said
today in a telephone interview. “In the third quarter, what
stands out is the progress that MFS is making.”  Sun Life rose 3.8 percent to C$25.29 in Toronto, the
biggest gain in about two months.  Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO) , the second-largest insurer,
reported today that third-quarter profit climbed 14 percent to
C$520 million, or 55 cents a share. It rose 0.4 percent to
C$22.91.  To contact the reporter on this story:
