Shares of smaller U.S. companies are
performing well enough this quarter to signal a year-end rally
in stocks, according to Ari Wald, an analyst at PrinceRidge
Group LLC.  As the CHART OF THE DAY depicts, the Standard & Poor’s
MidCap 400 Index has risen relative to the  S&P 500  since the
quarter started. The S&P SmallCap 600 Index has followed suit
more recently.  The increases in the index ratios are noteworthy because
they happened “during a period of market consolidation, when
investors tend to gravitate toward safer, bigger-cap names,”
Wald, based in New York, wrote in a note yesterday.  Companies in the S&P 500 had a median market capitalization
of $12.4 billion as of yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The medians for the MidCap 400 and SmallCap 600 were
$2.7 billion and $730 million, respectively.  The S&P 500 posted a 3.2 percent decline for the quarter
through yesterday. Most of the drop followed President  Barack
Obama ’s re-election as investors refocused on the U.S. budget
debate and  European debt crisis .  Smaller companies are giving “a positive indication of
recovery” by their showing, which bodes well for end-of-year
gains, Wald wrote. The analyst joined PrinceRidge, a unit of
Philadelphia-based Institutional Financial Markets Inc., last
month after eight years at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
