Crescent Point Energy Corp. (CPG) , the most
acquisitive Canadian energy company this year, said third-
quarter profit dropped 99 percent on losses from derivatives
contracts.  Net income fell to C$2.35 million ($2.36 million), or 1
cent a share, from C$204.6 million, or 74 cents, a year earlier,
the Calgary-based company said in a statement today. The company
reported a C$71.2 million loss from derivatives during the
quarter, compared with a C$293.3 million gain a year earlier.  Cash flow of C$384.2 million, or C$1.13 a share, matched
the average estimate of 16  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg.
Crescent Point gained 0.3 percent to C$39.29 at 11 a.m. in
Toronto.  The results, absent of “operational surprises,” were a
“non-event, given that the company had provided preliminary
production and cash flow estimates for the quarter,” Allan Stepa, an analyst at Desjardins Securities Inc. in Calgary, said
in a note today.  Crescent Point produced the equivalent of 99,631 barrels of
oil a day during the quarter, up from 72,258 barrels last year.  The company, which produces light oil from fields in
Saskatchewan, is increasing the amount of output shipped by rail
to avoid U.S. pipeline bottlenecks and get a higher price for
its product. Barrels transported by rail can fetch C$10 more
than crude transported by pipe, Chief Executive Officer Scott Saxberg said in an Oct. 18 interview.  Crescent Point, which tripled output in the past five
years, has announced seven acquisitions in 2012, the most in
 Canada ’s energy sector, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The company agreed last week to buy Ute Energy Upstream Holdings
LLC for $784 million in cash, its first purchase in  Utah ’s Uinta
Basin.  Western Canada Select crude futures rose to an average of
$76.75 a barrel in the third quarter, up 2.3 percent from a year
earlier.  The results were announced before the start of regular
trading on North American markets. The stock, which has 11 buys,
four holds and one sell rating from  analysts , has declined 13
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
