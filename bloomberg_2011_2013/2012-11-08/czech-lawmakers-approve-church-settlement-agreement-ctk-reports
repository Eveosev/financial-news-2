The lower house of the Czech
parliament approved a bill that will give churches property and
cash from the state totaling about 134 billion koruna ($6.7
billion), the  CTK  newswire reported, citing parliamentary
proceedings.  Churches will get back property valued about 75 billion
koruna and receive payments totaling 59 billion koruna spread
over 30 years, the CTK said. The bill helps settle claims for
property confiscated by the state during the communist regime
from 1948 to 1989.  To contact the reporter on this story:
