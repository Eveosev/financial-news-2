The  British Bankers’ Association  is
in discussions with the financial regulator as part of plans to
deter customers from using claims-management companies when
seeking compensation for wrongly sold loan insurance.  In addition to the  Financial Services Authority , the BBA is
also working with its members regarding the handling of
complaints, the London-based lobby group said in an e-mailed
statement today.  British banks have set aside about 11 billion pounds ($17.6
billion) to compensate customers improperly sold payment
protection insurance with mortgages, loans and other credit.
Claims-management companies, which help customers pursue
compensation for a fee or percentage of any award, have inflated
the cost of recompense and more than half of claims from some
firms are bogus,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Britain’s biggest
mortgage lender, said last week.  “The on-going work focuses on three issues as a priority:
addressing backlogs, making sure that customers can be confident
that the offers they receive are right and highlighting that
there is no need for them to engage a claims management
company,” the BBA said in the statement. “We are involved in
on-going discussions with the FSA to clarify the parameters of
their complaints handling guidance.”  The BBA is lobbying the FSA to say that the amount of time
consumers have to make a claim should be limited because it is
now widely known about by the public,  Sky News  reported earlier
today. BBA spokesman  Brian Mairs  declined to comment.  -- Editors: Jon Menon,  Keith Campbell   To contact the reporter on this story:
