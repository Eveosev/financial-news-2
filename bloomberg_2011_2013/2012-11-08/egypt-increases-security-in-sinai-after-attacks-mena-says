Egypt  has increased its security
operations in the northern Sinai amid frequent attacks in the
peninsula near the border between Egypt and Israel, the Middle
East  News Agency  reported today.  Additional military personnel and equipment reached the
area to support the police forces in the “intensive campaign
against terrorism,” state-run MENA reported today.  The move is part of a campaign to clear the Sinai of
terrorists and criminals, MENA said, citing an identified
security official.  A senior Egyptian security officer was shot on Nov. 6 by
unidentified assailants in north Sinai. The head of security for
the region was fired after the Nov. 3 killing of three policemen
prompted protests by lower-ranking security officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
