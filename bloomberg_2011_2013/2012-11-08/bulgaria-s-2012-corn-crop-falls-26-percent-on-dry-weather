Bulgaria’s corn crop fell 26 percent
to 1.64 million metric tons this year, compared with 2011,
because of hot and dry weather, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  The sunflower seed crop also declined 5.6 percent this year
from last to 1.36 million tons because of the unfavorable
weather, the ministry in Sofia said in an e-mail today.  Farmers have planted 1 million hectares with wheat, a
250,000 hectares increase from the same period a year ago, and
160,000 hectares with barley, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
