Japanese  stocks  fell the most in four
weeks as President  Barack Obama ’s re-election set the stage for
a budget showdown to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, and as
China’s Communist Party convened to pick new leadership.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that counts  North America  as
its biggest market, sank 3.5 percent.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301)  fell 2.2
percent after Japan’s machinery orders fell more than expected.
Oki Electric Industry Co. and  Citizen (7762)  Holdings Co. declined the
most on the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  after cutting their
earnings forecasts.  “There is no easy solution to the fiscal cliff problem,
fueling uncertainty in markets,” said Seiji Iwama, who manages
about 45 billion yen ($563 million) in assets at Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd. in Tokyo. Japan’s machinery orders are
“showing that industry is still deteriorating.”  The Nikkei 225 fell 1.5 percent to 8,837.15 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, declining the most since Oct. 10. Volume on the
gauge was almost 15 percent below the 30-day average. The
broader  Topix (TPX)  Index lost 1.4 percent to 735.35, with all but one
of its 33 industry groups falling.  The Topix has risen 2.3 percent since Sept. 6 after the
 European Central Bank  started a global wave of stimulus to boost
growth, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the  Bank of Japan 
following suit. Shares on the equity gauge traded at 0.9 times
book value, compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  Fiscal Cliff  Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.3 percent today. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  posted its biggest decline in a year
yesterday as investors focused on the fiscal cliff, $607 billion
of tax increases and spending cuts set to kick in automatically
in January. The Congressional Budget Office has said the  U.S.
economy  will contract next year unless the president reaches a
compromise with Congress to keep the increases and cuts from
taking effect.  “The U.S. economy will enter into recession unless the
country avoids the fiscal cliff,” said  Mitsushige Akino , Tokyo-
based chief fund officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co.,
which oversees about 30 billion yen. “In that case, the global
economy will also go into recession. The process for solving the
fiscal-cliff issue is expected to run into trouble.”  Honda sank 3.5 percent to 2,395 yen. Toyo Tire & Rubber
Co., a tiremaker that gets a third of its sales in North
America, slipped 2 percent to 194 yen.  Machinery Makers  Stocks also fell after Japan’s machinery orders declined
4.3 percent in September from the previous month as slowing
global demand hurts exports, while the nation’s current account
surplus narrowed to its lowest level for the month since at
least 1985. The median of 29 estimates in a  Bloomberg News 
survey was for a 2.1 percent drop.  Komatsu, the world’s second-biggest maker of construction
equipment, retreated 2.2 percent to 1,720 yen. Toshiba Machine
Co. lost 2.5 percent to 348 yen.  Some 551 of the 1,675 Topix companies post  earnings results 
this week. Of the 314 companies on the gauge which have reported
quarterly revenue since Oct. 1 and for which Bloomberg News has
estimates, 66 percent have missed projections.  Oki Electric Industry plunged 9.4 percent to 77 yen after
the maker of communication equipment slashed its net income
forecast 41 percent to 6.5 billion yen in the year ending March
31, citing falling sales in Spain.  Citizen tumbled 7.9 percent to 361 yen after the watch
manufacturer cut its profit forecast 29 percent to 8.5 billion
yen, citing slumping demand in Europe and China.  Isuzu Motors Ltd. (7202)  jumped the most on the Nikkei 225, rising
4.7 percent to 448 yen. The carmaker boosted its full-year net-
income forecast 12 percent to 91 billion yen, citing cost cuts.  China Changeover  In China, the nation’s Communist Party started its 18th
Congress in Beijing today, with delegates meeting over several
days to pick a new leader. Xi Jinping will probably replace  Hu
Jintao  as general secretary of the party that’s ruled China
since 1949.  Exporters to Europe fell after the European Commission cut
its growth forecast for the euro zone as the debt crisis ravages
southern Europe and erodes the economic performance of Germany.
The 17-nation bloc’s economy will expand 0.1 percent in 2013,
down from a May forecast of 1 percent, the commission said
yesterday. It cut the forecast for Germany, Europe’s largest
economy, to 0.8 percent from 1.7 percent.  The euro fell as much as 101.75 yen today in Tokyo,
compared with 103.01 at the close of stock trading yesterday. A
weaker euro cuts the value of European income at Japanese
companies when converted into their home currency.  Canon Inc., which counts Europe as its biggest market, lost
2.5 percent to 2,505 yen. Nippon Sheet Glass Co., a glassmaker
that generates about 40 percent of its sales in Europe, slid 2.7
percent to 72 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
