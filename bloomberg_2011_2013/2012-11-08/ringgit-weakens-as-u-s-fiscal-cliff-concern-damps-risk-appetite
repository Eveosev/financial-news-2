Malaysia’s ringgit was headed for its
biggest drop in a month as concern that U.S. President  Barack
Obama  will struggle to negotiate tax increases and avert
spending cuts damped appetite for riskier assets.  Obama’s re-election will set up a showdown with the
Republican-controlled House over the budget, with the so-called
fiscal cliff of more than $600 billion in expiring tax cuts and
automatic reductions in expenditure due to take effect in
January unless Congress acts before then.  Government bonds 
advanced for a fourth day before a monetary policy meeting
today, where  Bank Negara Malaysia  is forecast to leave its
benchmark interest rate at 3 percent, according to all 17
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  “The focus shifted very quickly from the presidential
election to the fiscal cliff,” said  Vishnu Varathan , a
Singapore-based economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. “The
potential for gridlock in terms of averting the fiscal cliff is
really weighing on markets.”  The ringgit declined 0.6 percent, the most since Oct. 8, to
3.0636 per dollar as of 12:28 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 3.0648, near the 3.0706
level reached on Nov. 6 that was the weakest since Oct. 15. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, held at 5.50 percent.  Malaysian industrial production rose 4.9 percent in
September from a year earlier, after contracting a revised 0.2
percent the previous month, a government report showed today. A
Bloomberg survey of economists had forecast a 0.6 percent rise.  Government bonds climbed. The yield on the 3.314 percent
notes due October 2017 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 3.17 percent, the lowest since July 27, according to
Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
