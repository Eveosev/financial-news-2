Nordic power for the first quarter of
2013 recovered from a six-week low after prices for next-day
delivery exceeded expectations.  Electricity for delivery from January through March gained
0.4 percent to close at 40.37 euros ($51.38) a megawatt-hour on
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo. The contract
earlier fell as much as 1.4 percent to 39.65 euros, its lowest
price since Sept. 25. Power for December gained 0.2 percent to
38.75 after dropping 1.7 percent to a record 38 euros.  Power for baseload delivery around the clock tomorrow will
cost 35.49 euros a megawatt-hour, a 4 percent increase from
yesterday’s price for today, according to an auction on the Nord
Pool Spot AS exchange in Oslo. The turnout exceeded market
expectations, as signaled by the Friday contract on Nasdaq OMX,
which closed at 34.75 euros.  Weather forecasts  continue to point to higher water
supplies in the hydropower-dependent region. The surplus
compared with the seasonal average may increase by 6 percent to
8.75 terawatt-hours in the next two weeks, Markedskraft AS data
on Bloomberg show. The area meets more than half its power needs
by running  water through turbines .  To contact the reporter on this story:
