European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will today announce the issuance of a new series of euro
banknotes, according to the Italian central bank.  Draghi will make the announcement during his press
conference in Frankfurt following today’s ECB policy meeting,
Banca d’Italia said in an e-mailed statement. The five-euro
($6.37) note will be the first to be put into circulation, it
said.  Central banks typically redesign their banknotes on a
regular basis to improve security and prevent counterfeiting.
The new notes will feature an image from Greek mythology, four
people familiar with the design said in August, even as  Greece 
struggles to meet fiscal targets, jeopardizing its membership in
the 17-nation monetary union.  Europa, the Phoenician princess abducted by Zeus who gave
the continent its name, will replace architectural images as the
watermark on the new notes, the people said. Putting a face
rather than a structure on the watermark may make it harder for
forgers to produce fakes.  Current euro notes show windows, gateways and bridges from
different eras in European architecture, both as the main
pictures on the bills and in the watermarks. The new notes will
retain these symbols and be very similar to those in
circulation, the people said.  The ECB, which has repeatedly delayed the redesign of euro
banknotes first introduced in 2002, will issue the new five-euro
bill next year, according to the people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
