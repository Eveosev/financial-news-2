Copper rebounded from a two-month low
as better-than-expected U.S. jobs and trade data and signs that
 China’s economy  may be on the mend signaled improving demand in
the world’s biggest metals users.  The  U.S. trade deficit  unexpectedly narrowed in September
on record exports, and fewer Americans filed claims for jobless
benefits, government reports showed today.  China ’s central bank
governor and statistics chief signaled that October data to be
published from tomorrow will show growth improving this quarter.  “Jobless claims were better, and the trade data show that
while the economy still has a long way to go, the positive
numbers we have seen are probably going to hold,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Archer Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  Copper futures for delivery in December rose 0.8 percent to
settle at $3.4695 a pound at 1:18 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Prices fell to $3.431 yesterday, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Aug. 31.  Reports tomorrow may show industrial production and retail
sales strengthened last month in China, according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months advanced 0.3 percent to $7,630 a metric ton ($3.46 a
pound). Aluminum, tin, nickel, lead and zinc also climbed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
