BrasilAgro-Cia. Brasileira de
Propriedades Agricolas  became the first Brazilian company to
list American depositary receipts on the New York Stock Exchange
in three years as the property developer seeks new investors.  The ADRs ended trading at $4.65, representing a 34-cent
premium to the shares traded in  Brazil , which closed yesterday
at 8.8 reais. The Sao Paulo-based company, which acquires and
develops rural properties in Brazil, has a market capitalization
of about $272 million and posted a net loss of 5.57 million
reais ($2.73 million) in the year through June  “We want to broaden our shareholder base, which is too
concentrated,” Chief Executive Officer Julio Toledo Piza said
in an interview in New York today.  BrasilAgro is the fifth Latin American company to list with
one of  NYSE Euronext (NYX) ’s exchanges this year. Brazilian investment
bank Grupo BTG Pactual listed global depositary receipts in
Amsterdam in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
