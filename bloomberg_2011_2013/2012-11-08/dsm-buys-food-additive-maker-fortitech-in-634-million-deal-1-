Royal DSM NV said it agreed to buy
Fortitech of the U.S. in a $634 million cash deal to expand its
bespoke food-ingredient business.  The purchase, expected to close this year, will add to
earnings in the first full year, the Heerlen, Netherlands-based
company said in a statement. DSM is paying a multiple of about
9.06 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, based on expected 2013 profit of $70 million.  The purchase of Fortitech, which supplies ingredients for
infant nutrition as well as dietary supplements, follows about
1.8 billion euros in takeovers by DSM to expand in nutrition,
including the purchase of baby-food ingredient maker Martek
Biosciences. Chief Executive Officer Feike Sijbesma is steering
the company away from lower-margin, commodity-based businesses.  “The acquisition of Fortitech is the ninth acquisition in
the Nutrition cluster since we announced our corporate strategy
DSM in motion,” Sijbesma said in the statement.  Integrating Fortitech into existing operations will
generate savings equal to about 10 percent of net sales by 2015.
Another $70 million in one-time synergies are predicted as DSM
avoids capital expenditure, DSM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
