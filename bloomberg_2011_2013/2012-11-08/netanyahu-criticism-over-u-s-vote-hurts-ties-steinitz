Israeli Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz today said “baseless claims” that Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu interfered in the U.S. presidential election
damage relations between the two nations.  Steinitz, speaking to Israel Radio, criticized remarks made
by former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert yesterday at a meeting of
American-Jewish leaders in New York. According to the Haaretz
daily, Olmert said Netanyahu intervened on behalf of Republican
candidate  Mitt Romney .  Steinitz pointed to U.S. approval last month for a loan-
guarantee program as an indication that Israeli-American ties
are as strong as ever even amid disagreements between Netanyahu
and Obama over such issues as how to contain  Iran ’s nuclear
program and advance the peace process with the Palestinians.  Some of Netanyahu’s political opponents have said the prime
minister’s public criticism of the Obama administration’s Iran
policies in the months before the election were intended to also
aid Romney’s electoral chances.  Israeli elections are scheduled for Jan. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
