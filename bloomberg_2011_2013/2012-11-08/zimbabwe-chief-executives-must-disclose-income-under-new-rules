Chief executives of companies listed
on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange must disclose their income
starting from next year as part of measures to make managers
more accountable to shareholders.  The new rules have been agreed with the bourse, Wesley
Sibanda, vice chairman of the Public Accountants and Auditors
Board, told reporters late yesterday at the exchange in Harare,
the capital.  “People should know they are not operating on an island,”
he said. “The bottom line is that an MD or CEO is your
employee.”  Martin Matanda, acting chief executive of the stock
exchange, said the bourse was embarking “on a journey to allow
maximum disclosure.” He said the new requirements apply to
corporate results as of Dec. 31.  The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange has 79 listed companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
