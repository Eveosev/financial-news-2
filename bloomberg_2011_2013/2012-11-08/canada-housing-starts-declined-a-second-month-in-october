Canadian  housing starts  fell for a
second month in October on declines in both single-family and
multiple-unit projects.  Work slowed to an annual pace of 204,107 units from a
revised 223,995 in September, or by 8.9 percent, Ottawa-based
 Canada  Mortgage & Housing Corp. said on its  website  today.
Economists forecast a reading of 210,000 according to the median
of 21 responses to a Bloomberg News survey.  The country’s central bank forecast that housing
investment, which helped lead Canada out of recession in 2009,
will become a drag on growth next year and in 2014. Bank of
Canada Governor  Mark Carney  told lawmakers last week that record
household debt burdens are the main domestic risk to an economic
expansion and there have been recent “mixed signals” about the
housing market’s strength.  “It’s a pretty safe bet that housing starts slow further
from here,” said  Robert Kavcic , a  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  economist in
Toronto. “It gets pretty interesting now because housing was
the strongest pillar of growth for the economy in Canada for the
last year or two,” Kavcic said.  Multiple-unit starts  in urban areas fell 11.4 percent to
119,732.  Single-family starts  declined 7.6 percent to a pace of
62,402 units, the lowest since March 2011, according to the CMHC
report.  Canada’s mortgage market will also be “volatile” over the
next few months after the introduction of tighter federal
lending regulations, Carney told the Senate banking committee
Oct. 31. He also reiterated that monetary policy is the “last
line of defense” to guard against household imbalances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
