The  Dominican Republic ’s Congress
approved a series of tax changes today in an attempt to trim a
fiscal deficit forecast by the Economy Ministry to reach 8
percent of gross domestic product this year.  The tax overhaul, which triggered protests outside Congress
today, was approved by 103 of the 174 legislators present in a
second-round vote, according a statement published on the
congressional website. The bill will now be sent to President
Danilo Medina to be signed into law, and the majority of the new
taxes will go into effect next year.  The tax changes will increase the national  sales tax  to 18
percent from 16 percent and raise levies on several products,
including tobacco and alcoholic drinks. Paired with government
spending cuts that accompany the package, the tax changes will
reduce the fiscal deficit by as much as 4 percent of GDP in
2013, Medina said on Oct. 4.  “The only option that the government has at this time to
satisfy the social demands without further going into debt are
new taxes,” Economy Minister Temistocles Montas said in a
statement published on the ministry’s website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
