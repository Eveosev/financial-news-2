Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI)  and China’s
Wanxiang Group Corp., competing bidders for assets of bankrupt
 A123 Systems Inc. (AONEQ) , tried to convince a judge today that their
preferred auction dates should prevail.  Johnson Controls told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey
that Dec. 3 would be the best date, while Wanxiang said it
presented a “qualified” bid to A123 and is seeking a Dec. 10
date, according to testimony in Wilmington,  Delaware .  “My client does not consent to an extension beyond Dec.
3,” Joshua Feltman, an attorney for Johnson Controls, told
Carey.  A123 Systems Inc., a maker of electric-car batteries that
received a $249.1 million federal grant, is asking Carey to
establish procedures for conducting a court-supervised auction.  A123, based in Waltham, Massachusetts, filed for  bankruptcy
protection  last month with plans to sell its automotive-business
assets to Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls for about $125
million. Last week, a unit of Wanxiang said it wants to be the
lead bidder for all of A123’s assets.  A123 has received interim approval for a $50 million loan
from Wanxiang, replacing Johnson Controls as the lender for its
Chapter 11 case. Johnson Controls said it withdrew as the lender
to avoid a fight over the financing.  Also objecting to parts of the sale process were the
official committee of unsecured creditors, the U.S. Trustee’s
office, Wanxiang and patent holders.  ‘Regluatory Approvals’  A123 asked the court to deny Wanxiang America Corp.’s
request to delay the sale process by 30 days, saying Wanxiang
“may not be able to secure the governmental regulatory
approvals it is seeking even under this extended timeline.”  Wanxiang is pursuing approval from the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the U.S. “to protect itself from the risk that
the sale could subsequently be unwound,” A123 lawyers said in
court papers.  U.S. Republican Senators  John Thune  of South Dakota and
Chuck Grassley of Iowa expressed  concerns  about A123’s financing
deal with Wanxiang in a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary
 Timothy Geithner .  “A123 has received millions of taxpayer dollars to develop
technology and intellectual property that should not simply be
shipped to China,” Thune said in a statement.  In its Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, A123 listed assets
of $459.8 million and debt of $376 million as of Aug. 31.  The case is In re A123 Systems Inc., 12-12859,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
