Honeywell Flour Mills Plc (HONYFLOU)  gained a
fourth day as investors speculated the Nigerian wheat processor
will repeat its first-quarter performance in the second, Lambeth
Trust and Investment Co. said.  The  stock climbed  4.5 percent to 2.31 naira by the close in
Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital, its longest rising streak
since Oct. 12. More than 1 million shares, or 56 percent of the
three-month daily average, traded, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  First-quarter profit through June jumped 10-fold to 475
million naira ($3 million) from 46 million naira a year earlier,
the company said on Sept. 20. Revenue rose to 10.7 billion naira
from 9.3 billion naira.  “The result was very impressive and that’s why investors
are taking positions on the stock now before the release of its
second-quarter results,” David Adonri, chief executive officer
of Lambeth, said by phone from Lagos today.  When Bloomberg called Honeywell’s Lagos office, a
receptionist said the company’s spokesperson was unavailable.  Honeywell traded at 2.68 naira on Oct. 12, according to
Bloomberg data, and some investors are buying now to sell it
when it reaches that level again, Raheem Mohammed, chief
operating officer of Kundila Finance Ltd., said.  “The possibility of the price rising to that level before
the end of the year is still there, and if you make 30 kobo per
share on 1 million shares, you would have made a lot of money,”
he said by phone from Lagos today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
