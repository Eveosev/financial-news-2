Gold climbed for the third time this
week on signs that increasing global stimulus measures will
boost investor demand for a hedge against inflation.  The  European Central Bank  stands ready to activate its
bond-purchase program if governments fulfill necessary
conditions, ECB President  Mario Draghi  said today. President
 Barack Obama , elected for a second term this week, faces a so-
called fiscal cliff of $600 billion in tax increases and
spending cuts to start in January unless Congress acts.  “I’m still bullish on gold, because we’re most likely
going to have quantitative easing for a while,” Fred Schoenstein, a trader at Heraeus Precious Metals Management in
New York, said in a telephone interview. “That’s on the minds
of traders with Obama coming back in.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.7 percent to
settle at $1,726 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Prices have jumped 10 percent this year.  The  Federal Reserve  has pledged to keep buying $40 billion
of mortgage debt a month in its third bid to reduce joblessness.  Silver futures for December delivery advanced 1.8 percent
to $32.24 an ounce in New York.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery increased 0.2 percent to $1,542.50 an ounce,
while palladium futures for December delivery added 0.7 percent
to $614.35 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
