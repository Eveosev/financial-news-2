William Morrison Supermarkets Plc (MRW) ,
the smallest of the four main U.K. supermarkets, said a sales
decline worsened in the third quarter, driven by fragile
 consumer confidence  and high levels of promotions at rival
chains.  Sales at stores open at least a year fell 2.1 percent,
excluding gasoline and value-added tax, the Bradford, England-
based grocer said today in a statement. That compares with the
median analyst estimate of a 2 percent drop. Sales fell 0.9
percent in the first half on that basis.  Morrison’s market share fell to 11.5 percent in the 12
weeks ended Oct. 28 as sales slipped into negative territory
behind the market’s growth of 2.4 percent, researcher  Kantar
Worldpanel  said this week. To combat underperforming sales,
Chief Executive Officer Dalton Philips has been revamping fresh-
food formats with flower ranges and hot-food counters, while
also ramping up discount vouchers like money-off at the cash
register and pushing into convenience outlets.  “We expect the market to remain challenging for the
remainder of the year,” the company said in the statement. ’’We
anticipate that our full-year financial performance will be
broadly in line with our expectations.’’  Morrison was little changed at 267.5 pence in  London 
trading yesterday. The stock has fallen 18 percent this  year .  To contact the reporter on this story:
