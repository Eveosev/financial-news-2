Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)  said its
largest shareholder, Mubadala Development Co., added a second
representative on the company’s board.  Mubadala, an investment arm of the government of Abu Dhabi,
nominated Ahmed Yahia Al Idrissi to AMD’s board, the Sunnyvale,
California-based company said in a statement yesterday.  “The appointment of Ahmed to the AMD Board is consistent
with Mubadala’s long-standing commitment to the company and a
reflection of the importance of the semiconductor industry to
the Mubadala portfolio,” AMD spokesman Drew Prairie said in an
e-mailed statement.  Mubadala, which  owns  almost 20 percent of the chipmaker, is
broadening its oversight of AMD’s management as some analysts
predict that a slowdown in the personal-computer industry will
leave the company short of the cash required to bring new models
to market and reverse its fortunes.  Yahia is a former McKinsey & Co. partner who is currently
an executive director of Mubadala Industry, where he is
responsible for its metals, mining, utilities and advanced
materials and products, AMD said in the statement. He holds
degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ecole
Centrale Paris.  Abu Dhabi, through Mubadala, took a stake in AMD when it
bought the company’s manufacturing operations to create the
contract chip manufacturer Globalfoundries Inc. in a transaction
announced in 2008. AMD is Globalfoundries’ largest customer.  AMD  shares  rose 2.5 percent to $2.03 at the close in New
York. They earlier rose as much at 4.6 percent. The stock is
down 62 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
