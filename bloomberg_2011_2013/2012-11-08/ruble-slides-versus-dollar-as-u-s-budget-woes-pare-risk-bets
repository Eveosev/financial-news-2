Russia’s ruble slid to the lowest in
almost two weeks on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis and wrangling
over the U.S. deficit will hurt the world’s biggest energy
exporter.  The ruble tumbled as much as 0.4 percent and closed down
0.1 percent at 31.5 per dollar by the close in Moscow, the
weakest since Oct. 29. The currency lost 0.1 percent to 40.16
versus the euro and declined 0.1 percent versus the central
bank’s euro-dollar basket.  The European Commission cut its growth forecast for the
euro area yesterday and European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  said the debt crisis is starting to “affect the German
economy,” Europe’s largest. The central bank stands ready to
boost Europe with bond purchases to avoid “extreme scenarios,”
he said today. In the U.S.,  Barack Obama , who was re-elected
president yesterday, now faces negotiations to avoid more than
$600 billion of automatic tax increases and spending cuts.  “Russia is highly geared on global growth with its
dependence on commodities,”  Barbara Nestor , emerging-markets
strategist at Commerzbank AG in London, said by e-mail. The
ruble is “mostly trading on the back of global problems, such
as U.S. policies and the projected slowdown in the Eurozone, in
particular in Germany,” she said.  The ruble has depreciated 8.1 percent from this year’s
strongest level of 28.9925 per dollar reached on March 26 when
Urals oil traded $2.74 off a high of $109.77 a barrel, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Urals,  Russia ’s export blend of
crude, was up 0.6 percent at $106.41 a barrel. Oil pared its
steepest decline this year, adding 1.1 percent to $85.34 a
barrel in New York.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.987 per
dollar in three months. The extra yield investors demand to own
Russia’s dollar bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell two basis points
to 188, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.  Bank Rossii plans to review  interest rates  tomorrow. The
regulator will probably leave the  refinancing rate  on hold at
8.25 percent, according to a median estimate of 23 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
