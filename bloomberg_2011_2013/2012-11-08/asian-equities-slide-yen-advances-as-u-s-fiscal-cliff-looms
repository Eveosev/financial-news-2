U.S. stocks  fell, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the biggest two-day drop of the
year, and Treasuries rose as investors speculated Greece’s
bailout will be delayed and that President  Barack Obama ’s
re-election endangers tax breaks for investors. The euro slid.  The  S&P 500  slid 1.2 percent to 1,377.51 as of 4 p.m. in
New York, the lowest level in three months. The  MSCI Emerging
Markets Index (MXEF)  lost 1.2 percent. The euro weakened 0.2 percent to
$1.2747 and touched a two-month low. The yield on the current
30-year U.S. bond dropped eight basis points to 2.75 percent.
The S&P GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials added 0.4 percent as oil,
gold and silver rallied.  Stocks have tumbled since the re-election of Obama and a
split Congress on concern they’ll be unable to compromise and
avoid a series of changes that have become known as the fiscal
cliff. Euro-area finance ministers will await a full report on
Greece’s compliance with the terms of its bailout, a European
Union official said.  “The clock is really ticking,”  Richard Sichel , who
oversees $1.8 billion as chief investment officer at
Philadelphia Trust Co., said in a phone interview. “Every time
you think the European situation is ready to go on the right
direction, there’s a setback along the way. Those things are not
being reversed as quickly as we would like to see.”  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  retreated 0.9 percent to
12,811.32, the lowest since July. In the S&P 500, energy,
financial and technology shares had the biggest declines in the
past two days, falling at least 4.2 percent.  Presidential Victories  Obama’s presidential victories have preceded the two
biggest post-Election Day selloffs on record, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg starting in 1896. The Dow’s 9.7 percent
plunge in the two days after he won his first term in 2008 came
at the height of the credit crisis that erased $11 trillion from
American equity values. This year’s two-day drop ranks second.  The Dow lost 32 percent from Election Day in 2008 to its
12-year low of 6,547.05 on March 9, 2009. From there it rallied
96 percent, handing Obama the biggest gain for any first term
president since  Bill Clinton , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  lost 3.6 percent, extending its decline since
its Sept. 19 high to 23 percent.  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s
largest restaurant chain, dropped 2 percent after its monthly
store sales declined for the first time in nine years.  The  Congressional Budget Office  released a report today
reaffirming its previous projections that allowing the scheduled
tax increases and automatic spending cuts to take effect would
lead to a recession in the first half of 2013. Congress returns
to Washington next week for a post-election session that will
focus on the fiscal cliff.  Interest Rates  The euro fell 0.9 percent to 101.22 yen after sliding 0.8
percent yesterday. Europe’s central bank left its benchmark
interest rate at 0.75 percent at its policy meeting in Frankfurt
today, as forecast by all except one of 63 economists surveyed
by  Bloomberg News .  “You have a Greek political situation that looks more
tenuous than it did 48 hours ago and you have European ministers
who will potentially hold off giving aid to them until later
this month,” said  Aroop Chatterjee , a currency strategist at
Barclays Plc in New York. “It makes for increased market
uncertainty.”  Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras mustered support in
Parliament to approve austerity measures needed to unlock
bailout funds, in a tense vote that weakened his majority after
the expulsion of seven dissenting lawmakers. European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the region’s economy may remain
“weak.”  Commodities Rally  Oil rose 0.8 percent to $85.09 a barrel in New York. It
rebounded from a 4.8 percent drop yesterday, the most since Dec.
14, after President Barack Obama won re-election. Copper added
0.8 percent.  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.7 percent to
settle at $1,726 an ounce in New York. Prices have jumped 10
percent this year. Silver futures for December delivery advanced
1.8 percent to $32.24 an ounce.   (SPX) Fewer Americans than forecast filed claims for  unemployment
insurance  last week as the effects of  Hurricane Sandy  started to
show up. Applications for jobless benefits fell by 8,000 to
355,000 in the week ended Nov. 3, the Labor Department said.
Economists forecast claims would be little changed from the
prior week at 365,000, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  Spain’s 10-year bond yield climbed 16 basis points to 5.85
percent. The nation sold 4.76 billion euros ($6.1 billion) of
bonds, more than its maximum target.  The MSCI All-Country World Index retreated 1 percent. The
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 1.6 percent as China’s leadership
congress began today, and South Korea’s Kospi Index slumped 1.2
percent after GS Engineering & Construction Corp. said profit
tumbled. India’s Sensex lost 0.3 percent,  To contact the reporters on this story:
