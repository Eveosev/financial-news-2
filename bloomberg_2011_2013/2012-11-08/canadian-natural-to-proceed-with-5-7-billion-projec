Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  will
proceed with plans to build a C$5.7 billion ($5.7 billion) plant
that will convert and refine bitumen from  Alberta ’s oil sands
and capture some of the carbon dioxide emissions.  Construction of the 50,000-barrel-a-day Sturgeon upgrader
and refinery northeast of  Edmonton  will begin next year with
operations starting three years later, Calgary-based Canadian
Natural said in a statement today. The project may be expanded
to handle as much as 150,000 barrels a day.  The Sturgeon project, co-owned by closely held North West
Upgrading Inc., includes an agreement by the Alberta government
to supply bitumen and guarantee a 10 percent return, part of a
program to boost processing in the province. Output from
Alberta’s oil sands is expected to double to 3.2 million barrels
a day by 2020, according to the Canadian Association of
Petroleum Producers.  “They’re at an advantage because they have a locked-in
return,” Phil Skolnick, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Ltd. in
 New York , said about the Sturgeon project in a phone interview.
Slowdowns in other companies’ effort to expand oil-sands
processing give Canadian Natural another reason to move ahead,
because of less competition for labor.  Suncor Energy Inc. Chief Executive Officer  Steve Williams 
said on Nov. 1 he’s reviewing the company’s C$20 billion
Voyageur upgrader project with Total SA because of “challenged
economics.”  Canadian Natural has faced repeated shutdowns at its
Horizon upgrader in Alberta. The company lowered its estimate
today for 2012 production from Horizon to as much as 89,000
barrels a day, from a forecast of 98,000 two weeks ago.  Canadian Natural also reported third-quarter adjusted
earnings that missed analysts’ estimates. Net income declined 57
percent to C$360 million, or 33 cents a share, from C$836
million, or 76 cents, a year earlier.  Canadian Natural fell 3.6 percent to C$28.02 at the close
in Toronto, the lowest  price  since Aug. 3. The shares have
fallen 27 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
