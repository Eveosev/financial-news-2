Coffee farmers in Vietnam, the
world’s biggest grower of the robusta variety used by  Nestle SA (NESN) 
in instant drinks, have harvested more beans than last year
because of an early start and favorable weather.  Growers reaped about 19 percent of the crop, or 280,000
metric tons, the median of eight trader and shipper estimates
compiled by Bloomberg shows. The harvest is set to drop 12
percent to 1.45 million tons from 1.64 million tons last season,
while 175,000 tons have been sold, the survey shows.  Robusta traded in  London  has declined 12 percent since the
end of September, dropping to the lowest price in nine months,
as harvesting in Vietnam accelerated. Global production of the
variety and the milder-tasting arabica is poised to increase 9.3
percent in the 2012-2013 year, pushing the world market into a
surplus, according to the International Coffee Organization.
While robusta is still 6.6 percent higher this year, arabica
futures have slumped 33 percent.  “The weather has been dry and sunny, which is very
beneficial for harvesting as well as for ripening of beans,”
said Le Tien Hung, Dak Lak-based deputy director of Sept. 2nd
Import-Export Co. Farmers collected more beans compared with the
same time last year also because the harvest started two weeks
early, traders said.  Dak Lak, the main growing region in  Vietnam , may get less-
than-average rainfall and humidity in the first 10 days of this
month, helping the harvest, the Meteorology and Hydrology
department said on Nov. 1. Farmers haven’t sold much from this
crop because  prices  at the start of the harvest are a “little
bit low,” Hung said.  Production Climbs  The global harvest will rise to 147 million bags in the
season that started on Oct. 1 in most countries from 134.5
million bags a year earlier, the International Coffee
Organization said in its monthly report. Consumption will gain
from 139 million bags in calendar year 2011, it said. A bag of
coffee usually weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Robusta is harvested mainly in Asia and parts of  Africa ,
while arabica is grown in Latin America. Robusta for delivery in
January was little changed at $1,930 a ton today on NYSE Liffe,
while arabica for December rose 0.4 percent to $1.5185 a pound
on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Robusta’s discount to arabica
has shrunk to 64.31 cents from 145 cents at end-2011.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
