China , the world’s biggest soybean
consumer, plans to stockpile the domestic crop for a fifth year
in an attempt to boost farmer incomes and increase state
inventories, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The government may  pay  farmers 4,600 yuan ($737) a metric
ton, said the people, who asked not to be identified as they’re
not authorized to speak to the media. The National Development
and Reform Commission will send a proposal to the State Council
next week, they said. The office of commission spokesman Li Pumin declined to comment when reached by phone today.  China has bought soybeans from farmers every year since
2008, giving the state “abundant” reserves, Chen Xuecong, vice
president of Sinograin Oils Co., said at a conference in
 Guangzhou  yesterday.  Purchases under this so-called temporary stockpiling
program have totaled 14.6 million tons, said researcher
Grain.gov.cn. About 3.75 million tons were auctioned this year
when global prices surged, while a further 2.45 million tons
were sold in the past two years to selected crushers, it said.
In addition to the temporary reserves, China holds so-called
regular inventories. Their amount is not disclosed.  The country set the procurement price at 4,000  yuan  last
year, according to researcher Cngrain.com, which cited a
government circular.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
