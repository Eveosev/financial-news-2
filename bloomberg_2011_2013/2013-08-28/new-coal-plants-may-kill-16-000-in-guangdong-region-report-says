Emissions from new coal-power plants
in Guangdong would cause 16,000 premature deaths in the southern
Chinese province and neighboring  Hong Kong  over the next four
decades, according to a Greenpeace  report .  Planned expansion of the 22 coal-fired plants would also
lead to 15,000 child asthma cases over the period, according to
a report released by the environmental protection  group 
yesterday.  China ’s plan to boost coal-fired power by twice the total
generating capacity of  India  by 2020 is straining its effort to
curb pollution that has spurred unrest about contaminated air
and water resources. The Greenpeace findings may also put more
pressure on Hong Kong’s leader Leung Chun-ying, who has made
cleaning up the city’s skies a priority with  air quality 
worsening since 2007.  “The cumulative impact of these new power plants on human
health is simply shocking,” Zhou Rong, Greenpeace’s Beijing-based representative, said in an e-mailed statement. “All
cities of Guangdong, and Hong Kong, are interdependent in terms
of air quality as well as public health.”  Emissions from Chinese factories and vehicles is a main
source of pollutants in Hong Kong, which has never met its air
quality standard targets since they were adopted 26 years ago.  Concentrations of  PM2.5 , fine air particulates that pose
the greatest health risk, from 96 existing power plants in the
Guangdong region caused nearly 3,600 premature deaths and 4,000
cases of asthma in children in 2011, the Greenpeace report said.  Coal accounts for about 70 percent of China’s energy mix,
according the  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
