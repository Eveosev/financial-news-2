Cia. de Saneamento do Parana, a
water company controlled by the Brazilian state of Parana, said
the state government and Domino Holdings SA, which holds 39.71
percent stake in the company, signed a new shareholders
agreement yesterday.  The new agreement ends court disputes between Parana and
Domino, allowing Sanepar to issue 781.1 million reais of shares,
Sanepar said in a regulatory filing. It also provides full
control of the company to Parana, removing veto rights that
Domino had in the previous agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
