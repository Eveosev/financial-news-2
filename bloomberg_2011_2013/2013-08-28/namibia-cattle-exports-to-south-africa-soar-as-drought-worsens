Namibia’s exports of calves to  South
Africa  may jump by two-thirds to 250,000 this year as farmers in
the southern African country seek to stave off the effects of
drought, even as higher sales lead to lower prices.  “We have been encouraging all our farmers to sell
livestock to get them off the grazing,” Sakkie Coetzee, the
executive executive manager of the  Namibia Agricultural Union ,
said in a phone interview on August 23.  The country is in the grip of the worst drought in 30 years
and many farms no longer have grazing or water, Coetzee said.
The NAU, which represents more than 2,400 commercial farmers,
says livestock prices have dropped to 14 Namibian dollars
($1.35) per kilogram liveweight, down as much as 30 percent from
last year.  The country’s agricultural output is forecast to decline by
5.5 percent this year before expanding by 6.1 percent in 2014,
according to the latest quarterly  review  issued by the Bank of
 Namibia  on August 21. Crop production will shrink by 9.3 percent
this year and grow 5.2 percent next year.  The NAU says it will take as long as five years for farmers
to recoup their losses and to operate profitably. “The impact
of this drought will be felt for the next two years but as
farmers it will take us about five years to restock,” Coetzee
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
