The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in Asia excluding  Japan  rose
to the highest in more than two months, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan jumped 8 basis points to 175 basis
points as of 8:13 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge, which advanced 9.7
basis points yesterday, is set for its highest close since June
24, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 7 basis points
to 129 as of 10:14 a.m. in Sydney, according to National
Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The benchmark is poised for its
biggest one-day gain since June 24 and its highest close since
July 12, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 3 basis points to 100
basis points as of 9:14 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The measure, which has ranged from 90.9 to 110.2
this quarter, is on course for its biggest one-day increase
since July 25, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. An increase signals deteriorating perceptions of
creditworthiness, while a drop suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
