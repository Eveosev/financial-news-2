Copper advanced as China eased rules
on overseas securities investments and after U.S.  consumer
confidence  added to signs of improving demand in the biggest
economy.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.5 percent to $7,348 a metric ton and
traded at $7,327 at 10:58 a.m. in  Shanghai . Copper futures for
delivery in December increased 0.2 percent to $3.3435 a pound on
Comex in  New York .  China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange  announced 
changes yesterday allowing qualified domestic institutional
investors, who manage investment abroad on behalf of clients, to
freely remit funds in yuan or foreign currencies into or out of
the country, and also simplified application processes.  “The change will make it easier for domestic investors to
put money into overseas securities,” said Xu Liping, an analyst
at HNA Topwin Futures Co. Xu said the positive news helped
offset concerns about tension in  Syria .  The Conference Board’s index of sentiment advanced to 81.5
in August from a revised 81 in July that was stronger than
initially estimated, as Americans grew more optimistic about the
prospects for the economy, the New York-based private research
group reported.  Copper for delivery in December on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was little changed at 52,800  yuan  ($8,625) a ton.  On the LME, zinc and tin declined, nickel and lead rose,
and aluminum was little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
