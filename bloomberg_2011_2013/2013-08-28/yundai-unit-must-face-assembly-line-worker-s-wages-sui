A  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  unit must face a
Philadelphia worker’s lawsuit alleging the company failed to pay
hourly employees overtime and cheated them on pay for shortened
breaks.  U.S. District Judge Ronald Buckwalter in Philadelphia today
denied a request by Hyundai Rotem USA, a maker of railroad cars,
that he throw out the complaint initially filed in February by
assembly-line employee Olivia Drake.  She’s seeking class status on behalf of all workers that
have been subjected to Hyundai’s allegedly unlawful practices
during the past three years.  Buckwalter threw out a Pennsylvania state law minimum wage
claim, while letting a federal Fair Labor Standards Act claim go
forward. He rejected the company’s contention Drake had to first
pursue arbitration under her union’s collective bargaining
agreement.  “The union could decide for reasons completely unrelated
to the merits of plaintiffs’ claims to deny the opportunity for
arbitration,” the judge said. He called that procedure
unconstitutional because it could force employees to waive a
substantive statutory right.  The court hasn’t ruled on whether workers can sue as a
group. Hyundai Rotem is a unit of Seoul-based Hyundai Motor Co.  The case is Drake v. Hyundai Rotem USA, 13-cv-00868, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of  Pennsylvania  (Philadelphia).  To contact the reporter on this story:
