The South African Rugby Union said
 Asics Corp. (7936)  will replace Canterbury as the clothing and kit
sponsor for the national side, the Springboks, and provincial
teams from Jan. 1.  The company, based in Tokyo, signed a six-year agreement
with SARU, Mark Alexander, deputy president of the nation’s
rugby governing body, said in a presentation in Johannesburg
today.  The Asics deal will cover the Rugby  World Cup  in 2015 and
the tournament in 2019. The Japanese company competes with
 Adidas AG (ADS)  and  Nike Inc (NKE)  and sponsors running in France,
Australia, the Netherlands and Italy. Absa, the South African
bank controlled by  Barclays Plc (BARC) , which was renamed  Barclays
Africa Group Ltd. (BGA)  on Aug. 2, is the main sponsor for the
national team.  “Asics has made a strategic decision to make the sport of
rugby a priority,” Alistair Cameron, Asics’s head of Europe,
Middle East and  Africa , said. “The Springboks are one of the
most important assets in the sporting-goods world. We want to
build the brand awareness together.”  Asics is also considering setting up factories in  South
Africa , he said.  The Springboks, which won the World Cup in 1995 and 2007,
is currently the  ranked second  behind New Zealand’s All Blacks,
according to the International Rugby Board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
