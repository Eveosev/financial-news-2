Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened as the motor fuel surged on concern the U.S. may strike
 Syria  and disrupt fuel supplies.  The spread expanded by 3.74 cents to 59.85 cents a gallon
as the motor fuel rose 2 percent atop a gain of 2.8 percent
yesterday. Both fuels have risen five times in the past six
days. An Energy Information Administration report showed ethanol
 output  last week fell 2.8 percent to 820,000 barrels a day, the
lowest level since March 29. Supply in the so-called PADD 2
region, which covers the Midwest, dropped to the lowest  on
record.  “Ethanol’s really been climbing,” said Will Babler, a
broker at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois .
“It’s baked in. That may be the disconnect you see.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery rose 2.3 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $2.496 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures, which have gained 14 percent this year, are headed for
the first monthly gain since May and the largest since January.  Gasoline for September delivery increased 6.04 cents, or 2
percent, to $3.0945 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  “The significant slowdown in production and the large draw
in PADD 2 inventories seem to support recent speculation that
many ethanol plants are shutting down for summer maintenance,”
said Michael Breitenbach, a broker and director of research at
Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in  New York .  Stockpiles, Imports  Overall ethanol  stockpiles  fell 1.4 percent to 16.3 million
barrels, the lowest level since July 5, data from the Energy
Department’s statistical arm show.  Imports of the biofuel sank 79 percent to 4,000 barrels a
day, a third week of declines and the lowest since June 28, when
the U.S. made no foreign purchases of the additive.  Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S. One bushel of the
grain distills into about 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  Corn for September delivery added 4.5 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $5.0425 a bushel in  Chicago . The more actively
traded December contract slumped 5.5 cents to $4.8075.  The corn crush spread, or the difference between ethanol
and the corn needed to make it, rose to 66.2 cents a gallon, the
highest level this year, from 65.6 cents yesterday.  A 2007 energy law requires refiners to use 13.8 billion
gallons of ethanol this year and 14.4 billion in 2014.
Compliance is tracked by Renewable Identification Numbers,
certificates attached to each gallon of ethanol that are
submitted to the government each year and that also can be
traded among companies.  RINs Decline  Corn-based ethanol RINs  decreased 2 cents to 68 cents, the
cheapest since Aug. 9, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced
RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based
ethanol, fell 3 cents to 75 cents.  Ethanol  refinery input , a measure of demand, was little
changed, according to the EIA.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 8 cents to $2.80 a
gallon in New York, 6.5 cents to $2.715 in Chicago, 7 cents to
$2.81 on the  Gulf Coast  and 2 cents to $2.85 on the West Coast,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor gained 1.5 cents to
8.5 cents, while the West Coast’s premium to the Gulf slid 5
cents to 4 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
