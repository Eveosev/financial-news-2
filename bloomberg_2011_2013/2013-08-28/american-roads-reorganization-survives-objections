American Roads LLC, operator of the
Detroit Windsor Tunnel linking the U.S. with  Canada , moved
closer to shedding $830 million in debt from swaps and bonds
after a judge denied a bondholder group’s bid to join the case.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland in  Manhattan  ruled
today that an ad-hoc group of investors didn’t have legal
standing in the case and therefore couldn’t object to American
Roads’ proposed reorganization. Under the plan, holders of
$496 million in bonds will receive nothing and ownership of the
company will change hands.  Lifland approved the company’s materials explaining the
plan to creditors -- a key step in advancing a Chapter 11 case
through court, and said he would decide later whether to approve
the plan, allowing American Roads to exit court protection.  American Roads, based in  Detroit , is owned by the private-equity company Alinda Capital Partners LLC, which negotiated the
July 25 bankruptcy petition because American Roads couldn’t meet
obligations under the swaps and bonds, which were issued in 2006
as part of a financial restructuring.  The plan calls for $334 million in swap liability to be
exchanged for sole ownership of American Roads by Bermuda-based
Syncora Guarantee Inc., which backed the swap debt.  The case is In re American Roads LLC, 13-bk-12412, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
