OGX Petroleo (OGXP3)  & Gas Participacoes
SA’s decision to abandon nine oil exploration licenses is
underscoring former billionaire  Eike Batista ’s race to halt a
cash drain and focus on restructuring $3.6 billion in bonds.  Batista agreed to pay 3.4 million reais ($1.4 million) to
return the licenses, which OGX acquired for 280 million reais on
May 14 after outbidding BP Plc and A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S. The
move leaves OGX with 35 blocks to develop in Brazil and
Colombia, including areas holding the Tubarao Martelo offshore
field where it has an agreement to sell 40 percent to Petroliam
Nasional Bhd. for $850 million.  OGX’s debt restructuring, which Petronas says is a
requirement for its deal, looms as the next major event in the
fall of 56-year-old Batista, a Rio de Janeiro entrepreneur who
amassed and lost more than $30 billion after his commodities
startups failed to turn profits. Batista this month agreed to
cede control of port operator LLX Logistica SA to EIG Global
Energy Partners LLC as he attempts to convince companies
including Glencore Xstrata Plc to buy a stake in mining unit MMX
Mineracao & Metalicos SA or its assets.  “The main challenge right now is negotiations with
bondholders and making sure the deal with Petronas goes well,”
Manuel Fernandes, the head of accounting and consulting company
KPMG LLP in Rio de Janeiro, said by telephone. “My
understanding is that the assets are for sale and the company is
trying to find a new partner to run the business.”  ‘First Time’  OGX bondholders hired Rothschild to advise on a debt
restructuring, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said
this month, asking not to be identified because the selection
process is private. OGX’s press department in Rio didn’t respond
to a request to comment on its  cash holdings  and progress on
selling a stake to Petronas.  Batista’s flagship company, the worst-performing major oil
stock in  emerging markets  this year, returned licenses where it
was unable to find partners, it said yesterday. The second-highest bidders now have the option of matching OGX’s offers to
take over the projects, Brazil’s oil regulator ANP said in an e-mailed reply to questions.  “It’s the first time I’ve seen something like that,”
Fernandes said. “The company’s financial situation is so
deteriorated it’s not even able to comply with the bonus.”  OGX’s cash fell 72 percent in the second quarter to $325
million, less than its average quarterly capital expenses in the
past year. OGX probably will run out of cash by the end of
September without the Petronas injection, Deutsche Bank AG
analyst Marcus Sequeira said in a note to clients. OGX’s $2.56
billion in bonds due in 2018 trade at 17 cents on the dollar.  ‘Light on Cash’  The company made the right decision to curb its exploration
campaign and focus on extracting oil it has already found, Lucas Brendler, who helps manage about 4 billion reais at Geracao
Futuro Corretora in Porto Alegre,  Brazil , said by telephone. It
needs to advance with its last hope to boost sales, the Tubarao
Martelo offshore field, where it plans to start pumping before
the end of this year, he said.  “We saw it as something positive because the company is
very light on cash, and there’s the issue of the debt,”
Brendler said. “It’s still hard to see what the future holds.”  OGX shares are down 84 percent this year, the steepest loss
among oil companies from developing countries tracked by
Bloomberg with a market value of at least $100 million. Deutsche
Bank has a target price of 10 centavos for the stock.  ‘Comfortable Position’  The exposure of Brazil’s state development bank BNDES to
companies controlled by Batista and his EBX Group Co. is
diminishing as the entrepreneur sells assets,  Luciano Coutinho ,
president of the bank, told lawmakers in a congressional hearing
in Brasilia yesterday.  Coutinho named Batista’s sale of a controlling stake in LLX
and power company MPX Energia SA’s share sale as transactions
that benefited the bank.  “We have a very comfortable position in connection with
EBX,” Coutinho said, putting BNDES’s lending to Batista
companies at about 6 billion reais. “So far, BNDES hasn’t had
any losses from operations with EBX.”  OGX’s failures at producing oil in the Campos Basin cast
doubts on its ability to extract at Tubarao Martelo with
Petronas, Ruaraidh Montgomery, a senior analyst at oil and gas
researcher Wood Mackenzie, said by phone from Houston.  “It’s still going to be dependent on how Martelo performs,
and that’s not at all certain,” Montgomery said. “You look at
all the fields around Martelo and they are all very difficult
carbonate producers.”  ‘Wildly Overestimated’  OGX planned to surpass production rates at state-run
Petroleo Brasileiro SA at Campos by targeting an older layer of
the Earth’s crust holding carbonate reservoirs formed from
ancient reefs. The highly-pressurized deposits would forfeit the
crude with less of a fight than the sandstone formations in the
same basin where Petrobras had been drilling for decades, OGX
said before it raised 6.7 billion reais in an  initial public
offering  in 2008.  The geology proved to be more difficult than OGX expected,
with flow rates varying sharply across the fields it discovered.
OGX will abandon three projects it previously declared
commercial in Campos and may halt work at Tubarao Azul, its
first crude-producing field, next year. Tubarao Azul is shut
after pumps malfunctioned at all three wells.  “One thing that’s very clear: they didn’t appraise the
fields properly before putting out that production target of 1.4
million barrels a day in 2019,” Montgomery said. “They wildly
overestimated the oil in place.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
