Treasuries (USGG5YR)  fell for the first time
in five days after the U.S. sale of $35 billion in five-year
notes drew the least demand in four years.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.38, the
lowest since July 2009 and compared with an average of 2.74 for
the past 10 sales. With a 1.5 percent coupon, Treasury will
issue the securities as a reopening of an August 2011 debt sale.
Benchmark 10-year  yields  rose before a report tomorrow forecast
to show the economy grew more last quarter than previously
estimated, fueling speculation the  Federal Reserve  may start to
curtail monetary stimulus.  “It was a mediocre auction,” said  Charles Comiskey , head
of Treasury trading at Bank of  Nova Scotia  in  New York , one of
21 primary dealers that are required to bid at the auctions.
“People are waiting for more clarity from the Fed and it will
come with the unemployment report and with the Fed meeting.”  The current five-year yield rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.58 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York after
dropping 16 basis points during the previous three days,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.375 percent
note maturing in July 2018 fell 1/4, or $2.50 per $1,000 face
value, to 99 2/32.  The  10-year yield  added six basis points to 2.77 percent.  Auction Outcome  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped to $292 billion,
from $325 billion yesterday. The figure is down from a 2013 high
of $662 billion reached on May 22 and up from a low of $148
billion on Aug. 9. The 2013 average is $312.7 billion.  The five-year notes sold today drew a yield of 1.624
percent, compared with a forecast of 1.618 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of eight of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers.  Treasury said the notes will have the same CUSIP number as
seven-year notes sold in August 2011 that carry a 1.5 percent
coupon and have about five years of remaining maturity.  “Accidental reopenings are very rare, and can be somewhat
disruptive, but today’s shouldn’t be a big deal,” said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York. “The
impact will be a slightly lower financing liquidity premium, if
anything.”  Wieseman said Fed, through its bond-buying program, owns
$14 billion of the previously issued securities.  Market Outcomes  “It will be difficult to squeeze in the repo market
because it’s a behemoth,” said  David Keeble , head of fixed-income strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank
in New York. “We have a lot more liquidity in the five-year
sector.” The repurchase, or repo, market is based on short-term
lending and borrowing of Treasuries and other securities.  Indirect bidders at the auction, an investor class that
includes foreign central banks, purchased 40.3 percent of the
notes, compared with an average of 44.2 percent for the past 10
sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 12.7 percent of
the notes at the sale, compared with an average of 15.9 percent
for the past 10 auctions.  Five-year notes have lost 2.6 percent this year, versus a
loss of 3.1 percent for Treasuries overall, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. The five-year securities returned
2.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries overall rose 2.2 percent.  Today’s offering is the second of three note auctions this
week totaling $98 billion. The government sold $34 billion in
two-year debt yesterday at a yield of 0.386 percent, and will
sell $29 billion in seven-year securities tomorrow.  Bond Outflows  The sales will raise $38.1 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $59.9 billion, according to
the Treasury.  Treasuries have  lost  3.1 percent this year, including 0.5
percent this month through yesterday, according to the  Bloomberg
World Bond Indexes. (BUSY)   U.S. bond mutual funds suffered their biggest redemptions
since June last week as yields reached a two-year high. Bond
funds had withdrawals of $11.1 billion in the week ended Aug.
21, the Washington-based  Investment Company Institute  said today
in an e-mailed statement. It was the largest move out of bond
funds since the week ended June 26, when $28.2 billion was
withdrawn.  Treasuries rose yesterday amid speculation the U.S.,  France 
and Britain are moving closer to military action against  Syria 
after the nation’s government allegedly used chemical weapons. A
United Nations team is on the ground to gather evidence to
establish use of chemical warfare, Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon
said today. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government has
denied the use of chemical weapons.  Allies Discuss  The U.K. is drafting a United Nations resolution to condemn
last week’s suspected chemical attack. U.K. Prime Minister  David
Cameron  said today the UN resolution would authorize action to
protect civilians in Syria.  Treasury 10-year note yields dropped 11 basis points in the
two days ending yesterday on Syria’s crisis. U.S. 10-year
securities yielded 27 basis points more than bonds in an index
of Group of Seven debt, down from 42 basis points more on Aug.
21, the most since May 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg based on closing prices.  The U.S. central bank purchased $3.3 billion of notes
maturing from August 2021 to August 2023 today, according to the
New York Fed’s website. Debate about when policy makers will
taper $85 billion in monthly bond buying has roiled financial
markets around the world in the past three months and sparked a
selloff in fixed-income assets.  Gross domestic product grew at a 2.2 percent annualized
rate in the second quarter, compared with an initial estimate of
1.7 percent released July 31, according a Bloomberg survey
before tomorrow’s Commerce Department report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
