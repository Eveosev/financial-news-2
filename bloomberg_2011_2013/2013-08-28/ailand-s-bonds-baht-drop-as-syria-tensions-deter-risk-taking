Thailand ’s government bonds fell,
pushing the 10-year yield to the highest level since 2009, and
the baht weakened as the prospect of U.S. military action
against Syria deterred risk-taking.  The baht touched a three-year low as official data showed
Thai manufacturing dropped 4.5 percent in July from a year
earlier, the fourth month of declines. The price of Brent crude
has risen 4.4 percent in two days on concern international oil
supplies will be disrupted as the U.S., France and Britain move
closer to action against Syria in response to an alleged
chemical weapons attack near Damascus last week.  The yield on the 3.625 percent sovereign notes due June
2023 rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 4.37
percent as of 3:54 p.m. in Bangkok, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. That’s the  highest  level for a benchmark 10-year security
since November 2009.  “Geopolitical risk is worsening the  market sentiment  for
emerging-market assets,” said  Tsutomu Soma , manager of the
fixed-income business unit at Rakuten Securities Inc. in Tokyo.
“Thailand’s economic data remains weak, adding to downward
pressure on the baht and other assets in the nation.”  Global funds  sold  $1.2 billion more Thai government bonds
than they bought this month through yesterday and pulled a net
$1.2 billion from local equities, exchange data show.  The baht fell 0.3 percent to 32.26 per dollar and reached
32.31 earlier, the weakest since Aug. 2, 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
climbed 12 basis points to 7.67 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
