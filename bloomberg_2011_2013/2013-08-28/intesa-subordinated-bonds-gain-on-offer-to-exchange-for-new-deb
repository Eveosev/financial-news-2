Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) ’s subordinated
bonds gained after  Italy ’s second-biggest lender offered to swap
the securities for new notes that will meet toughened regulatory
requirements.  The European Union is phasing in new rules on  regulatory
capital  meaning that existing junior notes will gradually be
disqualified from January 2014, the bank said in a statement. To
act as Tier 2 capital, a layer of debt that helps protect senior
obligations from loss, bonds must in future be structured so
they can absorb losses if the issuer needs to be propped up.  “The usefulness of the existing bonds as capital will
start to taper off from next year,” said Roger Francis,
a credit analyst at Mizuho International Plc. “It’s a question
of cost-effectiveness.”  Turin-based Intesa Sanpaolo’s 1.13 billion euros ($1.5
billion) of 6.625 percent bonds due May 2018, which the issuer
is offering to buy back at 107.75 cents, gained 2 cents on the
euro to 107.18, according to Bloomberg  prices. The lender’s
1.45 billion euros of 5 percent notes maturing in May 2019
gained 2.5 cents to 102.5, the price at which the bank said it
will buy them back.  “The exchange offer is aimed at allowing Intesa Sanpaolo
to optimize the composition of its regulatory capital,” the
bank said in the statement.  The new notes will pay 4.5 percentage points more than the
benchmark 10-year mid-swap rate, the bank said in the statement.
They will be denominated in euros and will have the same
aggregate amount as the notes accepted in the exchange. Intesa
Sanpaolo said it will accept all the bonds in the series that
are covered by the offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
