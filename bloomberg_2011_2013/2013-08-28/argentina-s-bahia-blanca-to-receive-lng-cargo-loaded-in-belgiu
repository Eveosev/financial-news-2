Argentina is scheduled to receive a
spot liquefied natural gas cargo loaded from storage in  Belgium ,
shipping data show.  The Trinity Arrow, with a capacity of about 153,000 cubic
meters, is en route to  Bahia Blanca , southwest of  Buenos Aires ,
according to ship transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on
Bloomberg. It was scheduled to arrive yesterday.  The vessel sailed from Belgium’s LNG terminal in  Zeebrugge ,
where it loaded the supercooled natural gas and departed Aug. 6,
the data show. The facility is used by traders to store and
export cargoes from the country, which doesn’t produce LNG.  Argentina has no long-term contracts to import LNG. The
nation is supplied through YPF SA, the country’s largest energy
company, and state-run Energia Argentina SA, known as Enarsa.
YPF closed a tender on May 6 to buy seven LNG cargoes for
delivery to Bahia Blanca. Enarsa and YPF have issued seven spot
tenders seeking as many as 150 shipments since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
