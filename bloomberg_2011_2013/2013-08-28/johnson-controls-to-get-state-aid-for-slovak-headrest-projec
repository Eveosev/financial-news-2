Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI)  will receive
state aid from the Slovak government in exchange for a pledge to
create jobs at a time when the economy is slowing.  Slovakia’s cabinet in the capital Bratislava approved 3.9
million euros ($5.2 million) in tax breaks and 240,000 euros in
cash subsidies for a venture the U.S. auto-parts maker formed
with Innotec Corp. to make headrests, the government  said on
its website today. The costs of the project, which would create
125 jobs, are estimated at 8.2 million euros, according to the
document.  State aid combined with labor costs, which are lower than
in western  Europe , are helping the eastern euro-area member to
lure investors, mainly from the automotive industry. The
government relies on foreign investment to help cut unemployment
that at 14 percent is among the highest in the European Union.  The cabinet also granted 3 million euros in aid for a unit
of caravan-appliance maker Dometic Holding AB, while  Austria ’s
car-parts maker Miba Sinter Austria GmbH will receive tax breaks
worth 3.6 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
