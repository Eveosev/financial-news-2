Muenze Oesterreich AG , the Austrian
mint that makes Philharmonic coins, increased sales this year
after tumbling  gold prices  fueled demand.  Sales of gold coins from January to July rose 79 percent
from a year earlier to 383,500 ounces, according to data
e-mailed by the Vienna-based mint, almost matching those for the
whole of last year of 400,000 ounces.  Mints saw sales jump after the price of gold, 15 percent
lower this year, plunged into a bear market in April. Surging
demand for jewelry, coins and bars in  Asia  helped prices rally
as much as 21 percent since the end of June.  “As soon as the gold price went down, many individual
buyers thought: ‘Now it’s the best time for us to get into the
gold market,’” Andrea Lang, the mint’s marketing and sales
director, said by phone yesterday. “As soon as there’s a
movement in the gold price, people are interested in the gold
market.”  Gold, which rose for 12 consecutive years through 2012,
slumped this year as some investors lost faith in the metal as a
store of value amid speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve would
slow its bond-buying program. Bullion prices dropped to as
little as $1,180.50, a 34-month low, on June 28 in  London 
trading. Minutes released Aug. 21 showed Fed policy makers were
“broadly comfortable” in slowing debt purchases.  Gold rose 70 percent from December 2008 to June 2011 as the
Fed pumped more than $2 trillion into the financial system by
purchasing debt, increasing investors’ concern about currency
debasement and accelerating inflation.  Asian Demand  Prices that are 26 percent below the record $1,921.15 set
in September 2011 increased physical demand in Asia. Consumer
buying in  India , last year’s biggest user, jumped 71 percent in
the second quarter from a year earlier. Chinese purchases rose
87 percent, helping to push global bar and coin sales to a
record and jewelry usage to the most since 2008, the London-based World Gold Council said Aug. 15.  “We sell everything we produce and we think it will keep
that way,” Lang said. “We’ll be very busy for the next couple
of months.” July coin sales rose 40 percent from the previous
month to 69,500 ounces, lower than April’s 116,600 ounces,
according to mint data.  Sales Surged  Mints from the U.S. to the U.K. reported a surge in sales
after gold’s plunge into a  bear market  lured buyers. The U.S.
Mint’s sales of its American Eagle gold coins rose 82 percent
this year through the end of July to 679,500 ounces from a year
earlier, according to data from the U.S. mint. Sales peaked at
209,500 ounces in April, before dropping back to 50,500 ounces
in July. Britain’s Royal Mint saw its gold-coin sales triple in
April, while  Australia ’s Perth Mint, which refines nearly all of
the nation’s bullion, said that month that demand jumped to the
highest level in five years.  Gold prices climbed to as high as $1,433.83 in London
today, the highest since May 14, as sales from bullion  exchange-traded products  stalled and amid political tension over  Syria .
Gold-backed ETP holdings increased for a second successive week
last week, narrowing this year’s drop to 26 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “People feel a little insecure about the whole economic
situation over  Europe  and they are worried the interest that
banks give them is now quite low,” said Lang. “These are two
very good motives to buy gold.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
