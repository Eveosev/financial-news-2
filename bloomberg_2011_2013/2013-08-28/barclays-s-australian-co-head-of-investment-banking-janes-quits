Barclays Plc (BARC)  said Daniel Janes, its
Australian co-head of investment banking, resigned and Tim Lindley has taken over as head of the unit.  Lindley jointly led the investment banking business in
 Australia  with Janes, Clare Williams, a Hong Kong-based
spokeswoman for the bank, said without giving a reason for
Janes’s departure. Janes, 39, led Barclays’s mergers and
acquisitions business in the country since joining the London-based bank in November 2009, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
