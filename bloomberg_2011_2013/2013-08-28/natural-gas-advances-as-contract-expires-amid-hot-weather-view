Natural gas futures gained for a
third day in New York, climbing as the September contract
expired amid forecasts for hotter-than-normal weather that would
spur power demand before temperatures moderate next week.  Gas climbed 0.9 percent as Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland , predicted above-normal temperatures in most
of the contiguous U.S. through Sept. 1, following by average or
cooler-than-usual weather in the eastern half of the U.S.
through Sept. 11.  “People holding short positions are exiting them as the
September contract expires and that’s why we’re seeing the
front-month contract moving higher than the rest of the curve,”
said Aaron Calder, an analyst at Gelber & Associates in Houston.
“We have a heat wave in the Northeast, but it’s unclear how
mild the weather is going to be after that.”  Natural gas for September delivery rose 3.3 cents to settle
at $3.567 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 27 percent below the
100-day average at 2:36 p.m. Prices have climbed 6.4 percent
this year.  The more actively traded October contract advanced 0.9 cent
to $3.582 per million Btu.  October gas traded 35.3 cents below the January contract,
compared with 36.3 cents yesterday.  November $2.90 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 0.1 cent lower at 0.7 cent per
million Btu on volume of 981 at 3:03 p.m. Puts accounted for 48
percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for October at-the-money options was 31.27 percent at 3:15 p.m., compared with
31.71 percent yesterday.  Chicago High  The high in  Chicago  on Aug. 31 may be 89 degrees Fahrenheit
(32 Celsius), 9 higher than average, according to  AccuWeather
Inc.  The high in New York may be 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 6 more
than usual.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm.  “The bullish case for the gas market is the hot weather
we’re continuing to see in the eastern U.S.,” said Tom Saal,
senior vice president of energy trading at FCStone Latin America
LLC in Miami. “Traders are also looking at the fact that the
peak of hurricane season is still around the corner.”  Tropical Weather  Showers and thunderstorms about 1,400 miles (2,253
kilometers) east of the Lesser Antilles have a 20 percent chance
of becoming a tropical cyclone during the next five days, the
National Hurricane Center said in a 2 p.m.  outlook.  Another
system over West Africa also has a 20 percent chance of
strengthening to a tropical cyclone during the same period.  The Gulf of  Mexico  accounts for 5.7 percent of U.S. gas
production, EIA data show. Sept. 10 is the statistical peak of
the Atlantic hurricane season, according to the National
Hurricane Center.  EIA data scheduled for release tomorrow may show gas
inventories rose by 62 billion cubic feet in the week ended Aug.
23, according to the median of 19 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The five-year average increase for the period is 66
billion. Supplies climbed by 64 billion in the same seven days
last year.  Stockpiles totaled 3.063 trillion cubic feet in the week
ended Aug. 16, or 1.5 percent above the five-year average,
according to the EIA. Inventories were 7.2 percent below year-earlier supplies.  Gas Production  The U.S. lowered its 2013 natural gas production estimate
to 69.89 billion cubic feet a day from last month’s forecast of
69.96 billion, the EIA said Aug. 6 in in its Short-Term Energy
Outlook. Output may rise 1 percent from a year ago to a record
as onshore supplies climb.  Inventories may reach 3.8 trillion cubic feet at the end of
October, about 130 billion below last year’s level for the time
of year, the EIA said.  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S.
last week fell by one to 387 last week, data from Baker Hughes
Inc. in Houston show. The total is down 10 percent this year.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first five months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1986, according to EIA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
