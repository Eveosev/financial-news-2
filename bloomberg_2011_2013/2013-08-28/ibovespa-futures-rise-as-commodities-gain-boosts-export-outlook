The Ibovespa dropped for a third day
as planemaker  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  led losses among exporters on
speculation that a strengthening local currency will erode
revenue from outside  Brazil .  Oil company  OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA  contributed
the most to the index’s decline. Iron-ore producer  Vale SA (VALE3) , the
measure’s heaviest-weighted stock, followed metals lower.
Retailer B2W Cia. Digital was the best performer on the
benchmark as traders pared bets on higher borrowing costs.  The Ibovespa dropped 0.4 percent to 49,866.92 at the close
of trading in Sao Paulo, with 33 of 71 stocks lower, after
erasing an earlier advance of 1 percent. The index’s 10-day
 volatility,  a measure of price swings, climbed to a two-week
high. The real appreciated 1.2 percent to 2.3437 per  U.S. dollar 
at 5:27 p.m. local time as the central bank’s intervention
supported the currency.  “Shares of exporters, such as Vale, have benefited from
the real’s depreciation, and now there’s a correction, with the
central bank acting more aggressively in the  currency market ,”
Joao Pedro Brugger, a portfolio manager at Leme Investimentos,
said in a phone interview from Florianopolis, Brazil.  The real has rallied 3.9 percent since Aug. 22, when the
central bank announced a $60 billion intervention program. It is
still down 11 percent in the past three months, the worst
performance among major Latin American currencies.  Embraer, Vale  Embraer, which gets 86 percent of its revenue  outside
Brazil , slipped 1.6 percent to 19 reais. OGX sank 17 percent to
57 centavos. Vale fell 1.5 percent to 31.25 reais. The Bloomberg
Base Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index declined 0.8 percent.  B2W jumped 6.3 percent to 13.29 reais. Swap rates on
contracts due in January 2015 fell 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 10.2 percent.  The Ibovespa has gained 11 percent from this year’s  low  on
July 3 as higher commodities prices and a weaker real boosted
raw-material exporters. Brazil’s benchmark gauge climbed 7.3
percent in dollar terms during this period, compared with a
decline of 0.2 percent for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index of 21
developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 7.03 billion
reais today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with a daily average of 7.75 billion reais this year
through Aug. 26, according to data  compiled  by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
