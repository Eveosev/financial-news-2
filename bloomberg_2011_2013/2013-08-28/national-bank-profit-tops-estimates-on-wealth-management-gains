National Bank of Canada , the
country’s sixth-largest lender, climbed the most in almost 14
months after reporting quarterly profit that beat analysts’
estimates on gains in trading and wealth-management earnings.  Net income for the period ended July 31 advanced 11 percent
to C$419 million ($399 million), or C$2.39 a share, from C$379
million, or C$2.14, a year earlier, the Montreal-based lender
said today in a statement. Profit excluding some items was a
record C$2.22 a share, the firm said, topping the C$2.06  average
estimate  of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  National Bank  gained  2.4 percent to C$81.14 at 4 p.m. in
Toronto, the most since July 3, 2012, making it today’s best
performer on the 45-company  Standard & Poor’s /TSX Financials
Index. The lender’s shares have increased 5.1 percent this year,
compared with a 5.7 percent rise in the index.  “The market has really undervalued our performance,”
Chief Financial Officer Ghislain Parent said a phone interview.
“We hope that what we see today is a correction based on our
year-to-date results and that it’s going to remain for the rest
of the year.”  Profit from trading climbed 42 percent to C$158 million in
the third quarter from a year earlier, while wealth-management
income rose 26 percent to C$52 million as fees on deposits and
assets under administration increased, according to the
statement. Earnings from consumer and commercial lending gained
1.6 percent to C$192 million.  NIM Narrows  Revenue advanced 5.5 percent to C$1.29 billion from a year
earlier, the lender said. Net interest margin, the difference
between what a bank pays for deposits and charges for loans,
narrowed to 2.26 percent from 2.39 percent a year earlier.  While not actively seeking acquisitions, National Bank
would be interested in buying a mid-sized wealth-management and
brokerage firm with between 40 and 80 advisers, Parent said.
“We’re looking at different opportunities and we know that the
other banks are looking also,” he said.  National Bank is the third of the country’s six largest
lenders to report results this week following  Bank of Nova
Scotia (BNS)  and  Bank of Montreal (BMO) , which both posted profit that beat
analysts’ estimates. Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank
and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are scheduled to release
results tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
