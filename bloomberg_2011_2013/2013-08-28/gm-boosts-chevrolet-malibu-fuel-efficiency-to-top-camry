General Motors Co. (GM) , updating the
Chevrolet Malibu after disappointing sales, said the 2014
model’s estimated fuel economy for city and highway driving will
increase 12 percent, beating the Toyota Camry.  The base 2014 Malibu, which reaches U.S. showrooms later
this year, will get 29 miles (47 kilometers) per gallon in
combined city and highway use, Detroit-based GM said today in a
statement. The 2013 base model was rated at 26 mpg, according to
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s  website .  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) ’s 2014 base Camry gets a combined 28 mpg, according to the
EPA.  “In this competitive mid-size segment, there is no
standing still,” Chris Perry, Chevrolet’s marketing vice
president, said in the statement. U.S. sales of the Malibu fell
20 percent through July to 123,573, while deliveries of the top-selling Camry decreased 0.6 percent to 242,406, according to
researcher Autodata Corp.  GM announced changes for the 2014 model in May, including a
sportier front end and roomier back seat intended to address
criticisms of the totally redesigned sedan introduced last year.
Today’s fuel-economy estimates are better than what GM had
previously said the updated Malibu would get. The company said
in May that city performance would increase 5 percent. In fact,
the base model’s city rating rose about 14 percent to 25 mpg.  Nissan Motor Co.’s 2014 Altima is rated at a combined 31
mpg with a four-cylinder engine. Honda Motor Co.’s 2014 Accord
with a four-cylinder engine is rated at 29 mpg in combined
driving as is  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s front-wheel-drive Fusion when
equipped with a manual transmission.  Stop-Start System  The Malibu’s fuel savings in the 2014 base model are being
achieved, in part, by including so-called stop-start technology
to a 2.5-liter, four-cylinder engine, GM said. The technology,
which had been included in the higher-end Malibu, conserves fuel
by automatically shutting off the engine when the car comes to a
complete stop. The engine restarts when the driver’s foot is
taken off the brake.  The design of the outgoing Malibu needed to be changed,
 Mark Reuss , president of GM’s North American division, told
reporters today in Hawthorne,  California .  “Since I’ve been here, the only thing I really didn’t feel
good about in our portfolio was the design of the front end of
the Malibu,” Reuss said. “We’re fixing that. We’re not going
to deny it. The old company would have stood around and defended
it.”  Production Begun  Production of the revamped car has begun and cars begin
arriving in showrooms as soon as next month, Reuss said. The
2014 base Malibu’s price, excluding destination fees, increases
by $145 to $22,140, GM said.  Separately, sales of the company’s plug-in  Volt  sedan will
be a record in August, Reuss said, without elaborating. The
high-tech  Chevrolet  model’s best month of sales in the U.S. was
2,851 last September.  GM rose  0.7 percent  to $33.92 at the close in New York. The
shares gained 18 percent this year, compared with 15 percent for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
