Aaron Curry, the fourth pick in the
2009 National Football League draft, is retiring after being cut
by the  New York Giants .  The 27-year-old linebacker made the announcement today on
his Twitter account, three days after being released by the
Giants. Curry said retiring was the best thing for him and his
family.  In five seasons with the Seattle Seahawks, who drafted him,
and Oakland Raiders, Curry had 203 tackles and 5 1/2 sacks. The
Wake Forest University product battled knee injuries in 2012 and
was released when the Giants cut their roster to 75 players.  To contact the reporters on this story:
