Asian  stocks  slumped, with the
regional benchmark index closing at its lowest level in two
months, on concern the U.S. will take military action against
Syria for using chemical weapons.  Honda Motor Co., which gets 83 percent of its revenue
abroad, lost 2.4 percent in Tokyo after the yen gained.
 PetroChina Co. (857) , the nation’s biggest energy producer, dropped
4.4 percent in Hong Kong after saying senior managers had
resigned or been ousted amid an investigation by authorities.
New  China  Life Insurance Co., the country’s third-largest life
insurer by premium income last year, fell 3.5 percent in Hong
Kong after first-half profit missed analyst estimates.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index dropped 1.5 percent to 129.27
as of 7:31 p.m. in Tokyo, its lowest close since June 27, as
more than four shares fell for each that rose. The gauge has
declined for eight of the past 10 days as the prospect of the
Federal Reserve paring stimulus as soon as next month spurs
investors to shun riskier assets.  “The situation in the  Middle East  is not stable right
now,” said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai
Securities in  Hong Kong . “A correction was already happening
across the region due to the Fed. Right now the bad news is
coming out of Syria and it’s accelerating the correction.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  were little
changed today. The measure slid 1.6 percent yesterday, the most
since June 20, as the U.S.,  France  and Britain stepped closer to
a military strike against Syria after concluding the regime used
chemical weapons against civilians. Data yesterday showed
 consumer confidence  unexpectedly rose in August as Americans
grew more optimistic about the outlook for the economy.  Regional Gauges  Japan’s  Topix index  slid 1.8 percent after the yen gained
the most in 2 1/2 months against the dollar yesterday, damping
the earnings outlook for exporters. Honda lost 2.4 percent to
3,610 yen and Sony Corp., an electronics maker that generates 68
percent of its revenue overseas, fell 3.4 percent to 1,967 yen.  The S&P BSE Sensex added 0.2 percent in Mumbai.  South
Korea ’s Kospi Index dropped 0.1 percent even as data showed the
nation’s manufacturer confidence rebounded from a six-month low.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index declined 1.6 percent, while the
Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.1 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex Index
added less than 0.1 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost 0.7
percent and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 retreated 1.1 percent.  Singapore Developers  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index fell 1 percent, its 10th
straight daily decline and longest losing streak since September
2002. A Singapore  property index  tracking 43 stocks dropped 1.3
percent after the government tightened its public housing policy
by reducing tenures for new loans and restricting purchases by
foreigners.  CapitaLand Ltd., Singapore’s biggest developer, lost 2.3
percent to S$2.93, its lowest price since July last year. City
Developments Ltd., the second-largest, slipped 2.2 percent to
S$9.76.  PetroChina dropped 4.4 percent to HK$8.27 after saying
three senior managers, including Kunlun Energy Co. Chairman Li
Hualin, had resigned and another was fired. PetroChina and unit
Kunlun Energy shares were suspended from trading yesterday.
Kunlun plummeted 14 percent to HK$10.88.  China Life  New China Life fell 3.5 percent to HK$20.55 after net
income rose 15 percent to 2.18 billion  yuan  ($356 million),
missing the 2.38 billion yuan mean estimate of analysts surveyed
by  Bloomberg News .  Among stocks that rose, Fraser & Neave Ltd., controlled by
Thailand’s richest man, gained in Singapore on plans to spin off
its property business through a Singapore listing at the end of
the year. The stock added 4.2 percent to S$5.72.  The Asia-Pacific gauge lost 0.1 percent this year,  lagging 
a 14 percent surge in the S&P 500 Index, as growth slows in
China and speculation that the Fed will taper economic stimulus
spurred investors to sell assets across Asia and  emerging
markets .  The MSCI Asia Pacific index traded at 12.6 times estimated
earnings, compared with 14.8 for the S&P 500 Index and 13.6
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
