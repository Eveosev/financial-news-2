Schaeffler AG, the family-owned
bearing maker that’s the biggest investor in car-parts producer
 Continental AG (CON) , lowered its 2013 sales forecast on weaker demand
for industrial components.  Revenue growth for the full year will be in a range of 1
percent to 2 percent, down from a previous forecast for an
increase of about 4 percent, the Herzogenaurach, Germany-based
Schaeffler said today in a statement.  “We probably will not be able to offset the weakness in
revenue experienced in the industrial division to date,” with
the global economic recovery sluggish and growth in China weak,
Schaeffler Chief Executive Officer Juergen Geissinger said in
the statement. “We continue to expect sustainable above-market
revenue growth for the automotive division.”  Second-quarter earnings before interest and taxes decreased
2.6 percent to 369 million euros ($494 million). Sales rose 2.3
percent to 2.86 billion euros.  The company reiterated it is targeting an Ebit margin of
about 13 percent of sales for the full year “due to the stable
earnings situation in the automotive division,” Geissinger said
in the statement. The margin contracted to 12.9 percent in the
second quarter from 13.6 percent a year earlier.  For the first six months, Schaeffler’s sales declined 0.7
percent to 5.61 billion euros. Ebit fell 7.2 percent to 724
million euros.  Debt Lowered  The company lowered net debt by 619 million euros from a
year ago to 6.5 billion euros as of June 30, Schaeffler said
today. Chief Financial Officer Klaus Rosenfeld pledged on March
21 to work on reducing financing costs further in 2013.  The Schaeffler group including its parent holding
Schaeffler Verwaltungs GmbH still has borrowings totaling about
10 billion euros stemming from its takeover of a majority of
Continental in early 2009. Since then, Schaeffler has sold a
part of its holding in the Hanover, Germany-based manufacturer
and refinanced some of its debt to lower financing costs.
Schaeffler still owns 49.9 percent in Continental.  The most recent refinancing step was by Schaeffler
Verwaltungs GmbH in July. The holding company owned by Maria-Elisabeth and Georg Schaeffler raised 3.88 billion euros of new
debt to replace financing arranged in 2009. It was the first
time the holding company tapped the bond market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
