England ’s cricket team apologized
for any offense caused during its Ashes victory celebrations
following reports that some players urinated on the pitch at the
Oval in  London .  Players relieved themselves on the pitch in view of venue
staff and journalists after England sealed a 3-0 series win
against  Australia  on Aug. 25, Sydney’s Daily Telegraph newspaper
reported two days ago.  “The whole team felt like an apology was a good way to go
and see that as the end of the matter,” fast-bowler Stuart Broad told the British Broadcasting Corp.  Spinner Graeme Swann wrote in yesterday’s Sun newspaper
that “the call of nature might have come once or twice but it
was nothing untoward.”  In a statement on the England and Wales Cricket Board’s
 website  earlier today, the team said that it hadn’t intended to
disrespect ground operator Surrey County Cricket Club, the Oval
or “anyone else involved in the game we love.”  “We got carried away amongst the euphoria of winning such
a prestigious series and accept that some of our behavior was
inappropriate,” the team said. “If that has caused any offense
to anyone, we apologize for that and want to reassure people
that it was a simple error of judgment more than anything
else.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
