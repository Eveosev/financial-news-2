Egypt  may receive more aid from
Persian Gulf countries which have already pledged billions of
dollars to the North African nation since July, a senior
official from the Finance Ministry said.  “We’re seeing signs of further financial support from Gulf
countries in the near future,” Samy Khallaf, head of debt
management at the ministry, said in a phone interview today from
Cairo. The expectation is for aid that is on top of what has
already been committed, he added.  Egypt, where political turmoil has prompted the military to
seize power twice in the last three years, got $5 billion in
July out of the $12 billion promised by Saudi Arabia, United
Arab Emirates and  Kuwait . The funds helped replenish the
country’s foreign-exchange reserves to $18.9 billion, the
highest level in 20 months, and strengthen the Egyptian pound,
which has depreciated 11 percent since December.  The Finance Ministry will issue in September local-currency
notes with a maturity of 18 months, after canceling similar-maturity debt sales in the government’s fiscal first quarter
which started in July. The issuance is part of its plan to  raise
a record  200 billion Egyptian pounds ($29 billion) in the three-month period, according to the ministry.  The sale of notes, which are mainly bought by local banks,
is the primary source for funding a budget deficit that swelled
to about 14 percent in the 12 months to June, from 10.8 percent
a year earlier.  Khallaf, who had resigned in May, resumed his position Aug.
1, without elaborating on the reasons behind his decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
