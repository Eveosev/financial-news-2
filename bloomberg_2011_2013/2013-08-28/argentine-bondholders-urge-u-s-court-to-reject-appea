Holders of Argentina’s defaulted
bonds urged the U.S. Supreme Court to reject the country’s
appeal in a clash with implications for tens of billions of
dollars in debt.  Argentina is appealing a lower court ruling that bars
payments to the investors in restructured Argentine debt unless
holders of the nation’s defaulted bonds, led by billionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp. and its NML Capital Ltd. unit,
are also paid.  In a court filing in  Washington  today, NML said Argentine
officials, including President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner,
were planning to defy lower court rulings against the country.
Fernandez this week said Argentina will offer to swap
restructured bonds into notes governed by local legislation to
prevent payment disruptions.  The Supreme Court case is Argentina v. NML Capital,
12-1494. The appeals court case is NML Capital Ltd. v. Republic
of Argentina, 12-00105, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit (New York).  To contact the reporter on this story:
