U.K. stocks  fell for a second day as
concern grew that the U.S. and allied nations will take military
action against Syria.  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG)  led declines
in the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  as the price of oil climbed to a 17-month
high, while  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  rose more
than 1 percent.  Meggitt Plc (MGGT) , the largest provider of wheels and
brakes for military aircraft, lost 1.1 percent after agreeing to
buy Piezotech LLC.  The FTSE 100 slipped 10.91 points, or 0.2 percent, to
6,430.06 at the close in London, paring an earlier retreat of as
much as 0.7 percent. The benchmark gauge slid 0.8 percent
yesterday after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the
Obama administration will hold Syria accountable for the
chemical-weapon attacks that opposition groups say killed as
many as 1,300 people. The index has climbed  9 percent  this year.  “The situation with  Syria  has expressed itself through the
oil price, and we’re seeing two airlines being among the biggest
declines in the FTSE 100,” Keith Bowman, an equity analyst at
Hargreaves Lansdown Plc in London, said by telephone. “Although
Syria itself isn’t a major economy and doesn’t hold a strategic
position in the oil industry, there is concern over the broader
implications for the Middle East.”  The U.S.,  France  and Britain have moved closer to military
action against Syria, laying out the justification, putting
forces into place and rounding up allies in the region.  Armed Response  The countries will focus any armed response on Syria’s
weapons capabilities, rather than directing their efforts at
deposing President Bashar al-Assad, U.S. and U.K. officials
said. British Prime Minister David Cameron said in  London  that
any course of action would be legal and proportionate.  The volume of shares traded in FTSE 100-listed companies
was 18 percent greater than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The broader FTSE All-Share Index slid 0.3 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index
retreated 0.5 percent.  Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, speaking to business
leaders in Nottingham, England, said officials are ready to add
stimulus if investor expectations for higher interest rates rise
too far and undermine the recovery.  Travel and leisure companies posted the third-largest
decline of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
as West Texas Intermediate crude advanced 1 percent to $110.11 a
barrel at 11:58 a.m.  New York  time. IAG, the owner of British
Airways, tumbled 4.5 percent to 287 pence.  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , Europe’s
second-largest discount carrier, retreated 1.8 percent to 1,212
pence.  Shell Gains  Shell, Europe’s biggest oil producer, added 1.8 percent to
2,130 pence. Tullow Oil, which operates rigs in East Africa,
rose 1.2 percent to 1,026 pence.  Meggitt fell 1.1 percent to 526.5 pence, the lowest price
in two months. The company said it has signed an agreement to
buy Piezotech for $41.2 million in cash. The deal will
strengthen Meggitt’s sensing-systems business, according to a
statement.  Kenmare Resources Plc (KMR)  plunged 8.6 percent to 27 pence for
the biggest drop since June 21. The minerals producer posted a
net loss of $10.2 million in the first half, compared with a
profit of $38.8 million in the year-earlier period.  Chime Communications Plc (CHW)  slipped 1.3 percent to 310 pence.
The sports-marketing company reported that its operating profit
and pretax profit both fell 73 percent in the first half.  G4S Plc (GFS)  climbed 2.9 percent to 252.40 pence. The security-services company said it has found buyers for two businesses to
raise 100 million pounds ($155 million) and has lined up an
additional 150 million pounds of potential disposals. G4S sold
141 million new shares, or about 10 percent of its equity, to
existing investors at 247 pence each.  Chief Executive Officer Ashley Almanza has made reducing
the company’s net debt of 3.2 times earnings a priority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
