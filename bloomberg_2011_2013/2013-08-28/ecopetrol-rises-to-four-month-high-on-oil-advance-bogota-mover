Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Colombia’s state-controlled oil company, rallied to its highest level in four
months as crude advanced on speculation that the U.S. will take
military action in  Syria .  Shares gained 2.2 percent to 4,465 pesos at 12:51 p.m. in
Bogota, which would be the highest on a closing basis since
April 11. Ecopetrol was the biggest  contributor  to a 1.1 percent
gain in the Colcap index.  Oil reached a two-year high on speculation the conflict in
Syria will threaten supplies from the Middle East. West Texas
Intermediate oil climbed 1 percent to $110.07 a barrel in New
York after jumping as much as 3 percent earlier in the day.  The correlation between oil prices and Ecopetrol shares
means there’s an “upside risk to the stock under a bullish oil
price scenario,” HSBC Holdings Plc analysts led by Luiz Carvalho wrote in an Aug. 26 report. “Ecopetrol is one of the
most oil-leveraged names worldwide.”  Ecopetrol shares have an R squared of 0.66 to rising oil, a
measure of the stock’s movements that can be explained by crude
prices, according to the HSBC report. A coefficient of 1
represents perfect correlation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
