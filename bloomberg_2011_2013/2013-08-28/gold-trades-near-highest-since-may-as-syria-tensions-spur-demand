Gold declined from a three-month
high in  New York  as a stronger dollar crimped demand for the
precious metal as an alternative investment.  The Bloomberg  Dollar Index , a gauge against 10 major
currencies, rose as much as 0.5 percent. Gold prices have fallen
15 percent this year as the greenback climbed 4.3 percent.
Earlier, prices rose to the highest since May on mounting
speculation that there will be an American-led attack on  Syria ,
boosting the appeal of haven assets.  “The dollar strength is working against gold,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien & Associates
in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “The market is
taking a pause after the sharp rally.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,418.80 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on Comex in New York,
after touching $1,434, the highest since May 14.  Surging demand for jewelry, coins and bars in Asia helped
prices rally 20 percent from a 34-month low of $1,179.40 reached
on June 28. Bullion is still heading for the first annual drop
in 13 years after some investors lost faith in the metal as a
store of value. The rout spurred at least $26 billion of
writedowns in the  mining industry  and losses for  John Paulson ,
the billionaire hedge-fund manager.  Silver futures for December delivery fell 1.1 percent to
$24.439 an ounce, after reaching $25.16, the highest since April
15. Trading was more than double the average for the past 100
days at this time of day, data compiled by Bloomberg  Platinum futures for October delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$1,540.10 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Palladium futures for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$748.25 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
