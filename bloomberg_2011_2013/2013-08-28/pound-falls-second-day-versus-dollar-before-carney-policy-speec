The pound fell to a two-week low
versus the dollar before Bank of  England  Governor  Mark Carney 
delivers a speech amid speculation he will affirm his intention
to hold interest rates at an all-time low.  The U.K. currency dropped against 13 of its 16 most-traded
peers tracked by Bloomberg and depreciated to the least in three
weeks against the euro. Carney has sought to underpin the
recovery by introducing interest-rate guidance to damp
speculation that borrowing costs will rise. U.K. government
bonds advanced after 10-year yields dropped the most since
September yesterday. Carney will speak at 1:45 p.m. in
 Nottingham , England.  “People are set up for dovish comments given that the bank
has had little success so far in suppressing forward rate
expectations,” said  Adam Cole , the London-based head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Royal Bank of  Canada . “The risk is
that a reasonably balanced speech today would be perceived as
less dovish than expected. The balance of risks is that we get a
little bounce” in sterling.  The pound fell 0.6 percent to $1.5452 at 12:55 p.m.  London 
time after dropping to $1.5449, the lowest since Aug. 14.
Sterling depreciated 0.2 percent to 86.33 pence per euro after
touching 86.40 pence, the weakest level since Aug. 7.  Carney will speak at an event hosted by the  Confederation
of British Industry . It will include audience questions after
the speech. When Carney unveiled the guidance plan on Aug. 7, he
took questions for an hour and gave five broadcast interviews.  BOE Policy  Bank of England  policy makers left the official  bank rate 
at 0.5 percent and maintained their  asset-purchase target , or
quantitative easing, at 375 billion pounds at their most recent
meeting ended Aug. 1.  The pound has strengthened 4.6 percent in the past six
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that
track 10 developed-nation currencies. The euro gained 4.9
percent and the dollar climbed 2.4 percent.  Yields on two-, five- and 10-year gilts have increased
since Carney said on Aug. 7 that officials would not consider
raising interest rates before unemployment reached 7 percent so
long as price and financial stability weren’t jeopardized.  The yield on the 10-year gilt due in September 2022 fell
three basis points to 2.57 percent after dropping 12 basis
points yesterday, the biggest slide since Sept. 26. The 1.75
percent security rose 0.2, or 2 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 93.44.  Deputy Governor Charlie Bean said in an Aug. 23 interview
in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , that policy makers are sending a
“clear signal” they won’t increase  interest rates  anytime
soon.  ‘Strong Rally’  “The strong rally in U.K. rates yesterday suggests that
the market is anticipating a fightback from Carney,” wrote
Jamie Searle, a London-based fixed-income strategist at
Citigroup Inc., in an e-mailed report today. “It was also a
reaction to Bean’s comments earlier this week. At the very
least, Carney is likely to repeat this message loudly and
clearly.”  Short-sterling futures advanced today, indicating investors
are reducing their bets on higher interest rates. The implied
yield on the contract expiring in December 2014 fell two basis
points to 0.85 percent.  Investors should buy short-sterling futures contracts
expiring between September 2014 and June 2015, expecting the
average implied yield to decline about 20 basis points from
about 0.94 percent in coming weeks, Citigroup’s Searle wrote.  Gilts lost investors 3.4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German
bonds dropped 2.1 percent and Treasuries declined 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
