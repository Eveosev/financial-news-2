The U.S. Treasury’s sale of $35
billion in five-year notes turned into additional issuance of
seven-year notes sold in 2011, the first so-called unscheduled
reopening of a security since 2004.  With the five-year yielding 1.624 percent at yesterday’s
sale, the notes were assigned a 1.5 percent coupon, matching the
interest payout on the seven-year security issued in August 2011
with the same 2018 maturity date. The debt sold yesterday will
be classified as a five-year note, according to the Treasury
Department.  “It was an interesting occurrence, but the issue will just
trade like an old seven-year note,” said Gabriel Mann, a U.S.
government-bond strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s
RBS Securities unit in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , one of 21 primary
dealers obligated to bid at the auctions. “There is minimal
risk of thin liquidity in the issue.”  The  Federal Reserve , through its bond-buying program, holds
$14 billion, or 47 percent, of $29 billion outstanding of the
seven-year debt, which would ensure no lack of supply for
investors seeking to borrow the security to sell it in a short
transaction, Mann said. A short position is a bet a security’s
price will fall.  Treasury said the notes will have the same CUSIP number as
seven-year notes sold in August 2011 that carry a 1.5 percent
coupon and have about five years of remaining maturity.  ‘Very Rare’  “Accidental reopenings are very rare, and can be somewhat
disruptive, but today’s shouldn’t be a big deal,” said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in  New York . “The
impact will be a slightly lower financing liquidity premium, if
anything.”  Treasuries fell for the first time in five days yesterday
after the five-year notes drew the least demand in four years.  The current five-year yield rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.58 percent in New York, after dropping 16
basis points during the previous three days, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.375 percent note maturing in
July 2018 fell 8/32, or $2.50 per $1,000 face value, to 99 1/32.
The 10-year yield added six basis points to 2.77 percent.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.38, the
lowest since July 2009 and compared with an average of 2.74 for
the past 10 sales. The notes drew a yield of 1.624 percent,
compared with a forecast of 1.618 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of eight of the Fed primary dealers.  Indirect bidders at the auction, an investor class that
includes foreign central banks, purchased 40.3 percent of the
notes, compared with an average of 44.2 percent for the past 10
sales.  Bid Patterns  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 12.7 percent of
the notes at the sale, compared with an average of 15.9 percent
for the past 10 auctions.  “These yields were not as attractive, given some general
optimism about the recovery and the broader risk of tapering
next month,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at
CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford, Connecticut.  Five-year notes have lost 2.6 percent this year, versus a
loss of 3.1 percent for Treasuries overall, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. The five-year securities returned
2.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries overall rose 2.2 percent.  Yesterday’s offering was the second of three note auctions
this week totaling $98 billion. The government sold $34 billion
in two-year debt the prior day at a yield of 0.386 percent, and
will sell $29 billion in seven-year securities tomorrow.  The sales this week will raise $38.1 billion of new cash,
as maturing securities held by the public total $59.9 billion,
according to the Treasury.  To contact the reporters on this story:
