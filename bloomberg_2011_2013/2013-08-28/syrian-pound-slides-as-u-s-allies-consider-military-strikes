Syria ’s currency slid on the black
market as the U.S. and its allies consider military strikes on
the country to punish its government for alleged use of chemical
weapons.  The pound dropped to 240 per dollar in unofficial trading,
according to local currency websites and a trader who asked not
to be identified. It was about 195 per dollar earlier this week.
The official rate plunged 8.8 percent yesterday to 123.7 per
dollar, according to the Syrian central bank.  Central Bank Governor Adib Mayaleh said there was no run on
the currency to justify the drop, according to the state-run
SANA news agency.  Syria has taken a series of measures to limit the decline
of its currency, which plunged as low as 345 a dollar last
month. President Bashar al-Assad has issued a decree banning the
use of foreign currencies for payments and offenders may face
prison sentences of three years. Syria’s 15 private banks have
been allowed to sell dollars to Syrians at a rate fixed by the
central bank and lower than the black market rate.  The pound traded at about 47 to the dollar before the start
of the insurgency against President Bashar al-Assad in March
2011. Since then, a deepening civil war together with
international sanctions have crippled the country’s economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
