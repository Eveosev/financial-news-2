Swedish  consumer confidence  improved
for a third month in August, rising to the highest in two years,
as Europe emerged from a recession and the government signaled
more tax cuts.  The  consumer confidence  index rose to 99.3 from a revised
98.3 the previous month, the Stockholm-based National  Institute
of Economic Research  said today. A  manufacturing confidence 
index rose jumped to 100.1 from a revised 94.9.  “Consumers’ assessment of both their personal finances and
the Swedish economy is more positive than in July, and the Micro
Index indicates that households are more optimistic than normal
about their personal finances,” NIER said in a statement.  The euro zone emerged from a record-long recession last
quarter, expanding for the first time since 2011, helping the
export-dependent Nordic economy. Sweden’s central bank last
month said it will keep its  main lending rate  at 1 percent until
the second half next year, while Prime Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt  this month called for a fifth round of income tax cuts
to support demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
