Canadian stocks  rose , rebounding
from the benchmark index’s biggest drop since June, as energy
producers rallied on a surge in  oil prices  amid growing
speculation of a U.S. military strike against Syria.  Niko Resources Ltd., an oil exploration company, gained 6.8
percent to lead advances among  oil companies  as crude touched a
two-year high. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. rose
2.3 percent, reversing a 4.1 percent slide yesterday. BlackBerry
Ltd. advanced 2.7 percent to propel technology stocks higher.
New Gold Inc. tumbled 7.5 percent to lead producers of raw
materials lower as gold fell from a three-month high.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Index rose 16.01 points, or 0.1
percent, to 12,607.22 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, trimming an earlier
gain of as much as 0.7 percent. Trading volume was 7.4 percent
below the 30-day average.  “It’s all about Syria -- that’s the risk,”  John Stephenson , senior vice president and portfolio manager who
helps oversee about C$2.8 billion ($2.7 billion) at First Asset
Investment Management Inc. in Toronto, said by phone.
“Commodities are moving higher. It’s a scarcity argument that
we are going to have another conflict in the  Middle East . The
market is up but very little and on very light volumes.”  The S&P/TSX dropped 1.3 percent yesterday, its steepest
slide since June 24, amid concern the U.S. will take action
against Syria. The U.S. and the U.K. today said they are
prepared to make a military strike without authorization from
the  United Nations Security Council .  ‘Appropriate’ Action  After Russia objected to a UN resolution offered by the
U.K. authorizing steps to protect civilians, a State Department
spokeswoman said the U.S. will take “appropriate” action
without the international body’s approval. The U.S. and its NATO
allies began presenting their justification for military action
against  Syria  as they advanced plans for launching strikes and
prepared evidence that the Syrian government used chemical
weapons on its own people.  Crude surged as high as $112.24, the most since May 2011,
as the tension over Syria escalated, increasing concern oil
supplies will be disrupted. The rally helped commodities surge
to the highest level since February. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI
Spot Index  rose  as much as 1.9 percent before retreating to a
gain of 0.9 percent.  Half of the 10 main industries in the benchmark Canadian
equity index advanced, led by a 1.7 percent rally among health-care companies. Valeant Pharmaceuticals rose 2.3 percent to
C$102.60.  Energy Producers  Energy stocks contributed the most to the equity gauge’s
climb, adding 1.2 percent on the spike in oil prices. Niko
Resources jumped 6.8 percent to C$5.48 to lead the surge.
 Athabasca Oil Corp. (ATH)  climbed 3.8 percent to C$7.66.  Technology stocks advanced 1.1 percent as BlackBerry, the
struggling smartphone maker, rose 2.7 percent to C$10.82.  The S&P/TSX Materials Index plunged 1.6 percent, the
biggest loss as a group in the benchmark index. The drop erased
an earlier advance of as much as 1.7 percent as gold, silver and
copper prices retreated.  New Gold slumped 7.5 percent to C$7.15. Torex Gold
Resources Inc. fell 6.4 percent to C$1.77.  Financial stocks retreated 0.2 percent for a third day of
declines. Sun Life Financial Inc. led the drop, falling 1.3
percent to C$31.82.  National Bank of Canada  gained 2.4 percent to C$81.14, as
profit from trading and  wealth management  boosted earnings at
the country’s sixth-largest lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
