Sino Land Co. (83) , the developer which
derives most of its earnings from Hong Kong, said full-year
underlying profit rose 25 percent on higher earnings from
property sales and rental income.  Profit excluding increases in real estate values grew to
HK$6.64 billion ($856 million) for the 12 months ended June 30
from HK$5.31 billion a year earlier, Sino Land said in a Hong
Kong Stock Exchange statement today. That compares with the mean
 estimate  of HK$6.4 billion of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Hong Kong developers last year accelerated property sales
including offices and malls as the Hong Kong government stepped
up measures to rein in  home prices . Earnings at Sino Land, the
worst performer in the nine-member Hang Seng Property Index this
year, was also supported by gains in rental income from offices
and malls in the city.  Shares of Sino Land have fallen 27 percent this year,
compared with the 9.9 percent decline in the property gauge. The
stock dropped 1.9 percent to HK$10.12 at the close of trading in
Hong Kong today, before earnings were announced.  Sino Land, the smallest developer in the property measure,
is controlled by the family of billionaire Robert Ng, who has an
estimated net worth of $5.1 billion, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Rising Prices  Earnings from rental properties gained 9 percent from a
year ago to HK$2.8 billion, while profit from property sales
rose to HK$4.51 billion from HK$3.02 billion, the company said
in today’s statement.  Hong Kong  home prices  have more than doubled since early
2009 and have surpassed their 1997 peak earlier last year. Leung
Chun-ying, who took over as the city’s leader last July, has
imposed extra property transaction taxes and raised mortgage
minimum down payment requirement in a bid to rein in prices.  Total home transactions in the city fell to the lowest
since 1996 in the first half as Leung doubled stamp duty taxes
on property deals in February. Prices have fallen about 3
percent from March, according to Centaline Property Agency Ltd.  Sino Land will pay a final dividend of 38 Hong Kong cents a
share, compared with 36 Hong Kong cents a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
