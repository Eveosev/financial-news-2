Motiva Enterprises LLC’s  Port
Arthur ,  Texas ,  refinery  is performing minor repairs on a
hydrocracker that caught fire Aug. 17 and expects to restart it,
along with the plant’s largest crude unit, in a week or so, a
person familiar with the work said.  The refinery is repairing electrical wiring at the
hydrocracker, which doesn’t appear to have been structurally
damaged in the blaze, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the information isn’t public. The plant’s
325,000-barrel-a-day crude unit, taken out of service because it
feeds gasoil to the hydrocracker, will resume operations once
the cracker returns, the person said.  Destin Singleton, a Houston-based spokeswoman for Motiva,
declined by e-mail to comment on the repairs. She said Aug. 19
that a unit was shut after “an operational issue” and that
several other units associated with it were either taken out of
service or are running at reduced rates.  The Port Arthur refinery can process 600,000 barrels of
crude a day, making it the largest in the U.S., data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Motiva, a joint venture between refining units
of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., finished
an expansion at the plant last year that allows it to handle
most crude grades, the company’s website shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
