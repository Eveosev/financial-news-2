Chateau La Conseillante, a  Bordeaux 
wine estate on the right bank of the Dordogne, is seeing its
2008 vintage rally on the Liv-ex market at the same time as
auction demand persists for its more mature 2000 vintage.  While the 2008 vintage still trades infrequently, two cases
sold for 750 pounds ($1,170) each on Liv-ex late last month, up
6 percent from six months ago and a gain of 60 percent from the
470 pounds which it fetched in August 2009 soon after its
release, according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  While the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of top Bordeaux wines
has risen 4 percent since the start of 2013, gains came mainly
in the first 10 weeks of the year, with prices sliding since
mid-March. A muted response to Bordeaux 2012 wine futures sales
has focused demand on older vintages, while some right-bank
areas including Pomerol have also seen more buying interest.  “Right-bank wines were more robust” in recent weeks,
 Chris Smith , investment manager at The Wine Investment Fund in
 London , said in his recent monthly market report. The fund,
invested in Bordeaux, manages $50 million.  La Conseillante’s older 2000 vintage has seen at least 10
lots traded at auction since the start of this year, including
five cases at a Christie’s  New York  sale in March, one of which
sold for $2,662, a second for $2,178 and three others for $2,057
apiece. At the same auction house at the end of May, 12 bottles
of the same vintage fetched $2,440.  Merlot Vines  Chateau La Conseillante, in Bordeaux’s Pomerol region, was
acquired by the Nicolas family, the present owners, in 1871 and
has 12 hectares (30 acres) under vines, of which 80 percent are
Merlot and 20 percent Cabernet Franc. Winemaker Jean-Michel
Laporte has been director since 2004 and Michel Rolland began
consulting at the winery this year.  The 2000 Conseillante is the estate’s most expensive since
the 1990 vintage, according to merchant data compiled by Liv-ex,
and was awarded 96 points by U.S. critic  Robert Parker , putting
it among the top four vintages of the past 15 years. The 2008
was rated at 95 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
