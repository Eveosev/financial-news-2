First-time buyers in  London  got the
most home loans in more than five years in the latest sign of a
boom in the city’s residential real estate market, according to
a group representing U.K. mortgage lenders.  The 11,200 mortgages given to those buying their first home
in the U.K. capital in the second quarter was a 38 percent
increase from a year earlier and the most since the end of 2007,
the  Council of Mortgage Lenders  said today in a  statement .
First-time buyers accounted for 56 percent of London home loans
in the period compared with 46 percent in all of Britain.  “Mortgage lending in London has followed a similar pattern
to the rest of the U.K. with strong house purchase activity this
quarter, strengthened particularly by first-time buyer
activity,” Paul Smee, director general of the CML, said in the
statement. The rise in total lending “suggests increasing
confidence that economic conditions are becoming more
favorable.”  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  has introduced
measures to increase mortgage availability, helping revive the
housing market. Record London house prices are leading first-time buyers to take on more debt and the average amount they
borrowed rose 6.9 percent in the second quarter, according to
data compiled by the CML.  Lenders granted 20,100 home loans worth 5.1 billion pounds
($7.9 billion) in London in the second quarter, a 20 percent
increase from a year earlier, CML said. The group’s members
account for about 95 percent of all residential loans in the
U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
