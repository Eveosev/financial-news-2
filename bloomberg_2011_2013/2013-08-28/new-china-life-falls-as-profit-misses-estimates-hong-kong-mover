New China Life Insurance Co. (1336) , the
nation’s third-largest life insurer by premium income last year,
fell by the most in more than a month in  Hong Kong  trading after
first-half profit missed analyst estimates.  The  stock  dropped as much as 3.8 percent, the most since
July 12, and traded 3.1 percent lower at HK$20.65 as of 10:36
a.m. local time.  Net income  rose 15 percent to 2.18 billion yuan
($356 million), the company said in an exchange filing
yesterday, missing the 2.38 billion yuan mean estimate of five
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  New China Life’s gross premiums fell 8 percent in the first
half after sales of new policies over bank counters tumbled 55
percent as higher-return wealth management products offered by
lenders erode the appeal of insurance products.  “Business continued to worsen,” Tong Chengdun, Shenzhen-based analyst at Guosen Securities Co., wrote in a report today,
citing declines in both sales through banks and the more
profitable new business acquired by individual agents.  The Beijing-based insurer also reported 573 million  yuan  in
unrealized losses from investments, reversing 272 million yuan
of gains a year earlier, as the benchmark  Shanghai Composite
Index (SHCOMP)  declined 13 percent in the first half amid an economic
slowdown.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
