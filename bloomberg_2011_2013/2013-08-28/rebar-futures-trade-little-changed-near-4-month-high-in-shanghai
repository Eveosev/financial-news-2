Steel reinforcement-bar futures
traded near the highest in four months as investors weighed
signs of improving demand against lower amounts of cash
available at the end of the month.  Rebar for January delivery was unchanged at 3,818  yuan 
($624) a metric ton at 10:30 a.m. local time, after swinging
between 3,803 yuan and 3,835 yuan. Futures touched a four-month
high of 3,848 yuan on Aug. 14.  Building material demand usually improves in autumn as
construction increases on infrastructure and property projects
across the country, said Zheng Nan, analyst at Shenyin & Wanguo
Futures Co. in  Shanghai . A monthly short-term liquidity squeeze
for traders and wholesalers will weigh on prices, Zheng said.  “The market is held in consolidation mode at this point,
which could last for a few days,” Zheng said.  The average  spot price  of rebar was little changed
yesterday at 3,604 yuan a ton, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at
Tianjin port was unchanged at $138.70 a dry ton, according to a
price index compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
