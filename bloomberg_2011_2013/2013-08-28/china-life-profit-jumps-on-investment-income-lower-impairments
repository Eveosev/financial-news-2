China Life Insurance Co. (2628) , the
nation’s largest insurer, said profit jumped 68 percent in the
first half of this year as investment income rose and impairment
losses dropped.  Net income  increased to 16.2 billion  yuan  ($2.65 billion),
or 0.57 yuan a share, from 9.64 billion yuan, or 0.34 yuan a
share, a year earlier, the Beijing-based insurer said in a
statement to the Shanghai stock exchange today. The company said
July 30 that first-half profit may increase by more than 50
percent.  China Life wrote off 31.1 billion yuan last year to absorb
declines in the value of its equity holdings, helping it to book
gains from a bull run in the benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) 
early this year before stocks tumbled amid an economic slowdown.
Net premiums earned climbed 8.7 percent, reversing a decline in
the same period last year, as the company boosted sales of
lower-margin products to improve growth.  “As a major institutional investor, China Life’s
investment returns benefited hugely from improvements in the
market, pushing up its profit growth,” Chen Xingyu, a Shanghai-based analyst at Phillip Securities Group, said before the
statement.  Investment income rose 25 percent to 49.4 billion yuan, the
company said. Impairment losses from investments, which jumped
140 percent last year, dropped 76 percent in the first half to
3.7 billion yuan, according to the statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
