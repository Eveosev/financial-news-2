Ivanplats Ltd. (IVP) , the mine developer
founded by billionaire investor Robert Friedland, changed its
name to Ivanhoe Mines Ltd.  The change is effective today and the Vancouver-based
company will trade under the ticker IVN in Toronto, it said in a
statement.  “This is the right time to make the transition to a
corporate identity that more broadly reflects the fact that
Ivanplats has grown and evolved in recent years to become much
more than a singularly focused platinum-group metals company,”
Friedland, chairman of the company, said in the statement.  Ivanhoe Mines was the name of another mining company, also
founded by Friedland, that Rio Tinto Group gained control of in
2012. That company is now known as  Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TRQ)   To contact the reporter on this story:
