China  will widen the scope of its
consumption tax to include more  luxury goods , the official
Xinhua  News Agency  reported, a sign that some high-end brands
may become more expensive for purchasers on the mainland.  The Asian nation is also targeting goods that cause heavy
pollution or use excessive levels of energy for consumption tax
adjustments, Xinhua said on its official  microblog  today. The
news agency cited a report by China’s finance minister  Lou Jiwei 
to the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress.  High consumption and import taxes are already driving
Chinese buyers to make luxury purchases overseas rather than at
home, propping up European sales for brands from  Prada SpA (1913)  to
Gucci. Close to a third of Chinese luxury buyers will shop in
Europe in 2013, industry consultant McKinsey & Co. estimates, up
from a fifth last year.  The news agency didn’t specify which new items would be
taxed.  The country already has consumption taxes on a variety of
products, including taxes of as much as 20 percent for high-end
watches and 5 percent on gold, silver, platinium and diamond
jewelry, according to research by HSBC Holdings Plc. Gem sets
are subject to a 10 percent consumer tariff.  Chinese consumers are set to make up a third of luxury
consumption globally by 2015, up from 27 percent in 2012,
according to McKinsey.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
