 Sanofi (SAN) , France’s largest drugmaker,
is selling its first bonds in euros since November 2012 as
credit risk held at the highest in more than seven weeks.  Paris-based Sanofi is offering 1 billion euros ($1.3
billion) of seven-year securities that will yield 27 basis
points more than swaps, according to a person familiar with the
deal, who asked not to be identified before it is completed. The
Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-default swaps on 125
companies with investment-grade ratings rose 1.79 basis points
to 109.3 basis points at 11:40 a.m. in  London , the highest since
July 10.  Markets around the world are being roiled by the prospect
of the U.S.,  France  and Britain taking military action against
Syria. Yield premiums on  investment-grade  debt are holding near
the lowest in three months at 78.6 basis points more than swaps,
Bloomberg bond index data show.  “There is a wait-and-see mood in the market at the moment
even as new issuance picks up again,” said Thomas Kristiansson,
head of credit fixed income at SEB AB in  Stockholm . “People are
hesitant to add more risk as they don’t know how big the
response from the U.S. and its allies against Syria will be and
the outcome of any action.”  The European Financial Stability Facility is offering 3
billion euros of bonds due September 2034 that will yield 37
basis points more than the benchmark swaps rate.  Also in the new issue market,  Finland  is selling five-year
bonds in euros to yield 16 basis points below the mid-swap rate.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of default swaps on 50
high-yield companies rose 4.72 basis points to 442.85 basis
points, the highest since July 5. The average yield investors
demand to hold junk-rated euro bonds climbed to 4.9 percent, the
highest in almost six weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
