Japanese  shares  declined, with the
 Topix (TPX)  index heading for a third day of losses, as the yen held
gains against the dollar amid heightened tensions over  Syria .  The Topix lost 1.7 percent to 1,114.23 as of 9:00 a.m. in
Tokyo, with all 33 industry groups falling. The Nikkei 225 Stock
Average declined 1.9 percent to 13,283.33.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less
than 0.1 percent. The measure fell the most since June 20
yesterday, amid growing tension over possible military action in
Syria. U.S. President  Barack Obama  is working with allies to
reach agreement on limited action against Syria after concluding
the regime used chemical weapons against civilians.  U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  sparked losses in global
equities on Aug. 26 when he said President Obama believes Syria
must be held accountable for the “moral obscenity” of using
chemical weapons against its people, stoking concern unrest may
disrupt Middle Eastern oil supplies. West Texas Intermediate
crude advanced to the highest level in 18 months yesterday and
extended gains today.  Western powers told the Syrian opposition to expect a
strike against President Bashar al-Assad’s forces within days,
Reuters reported, citing sources who attended a meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
