Westfield Group (WDC) , the world’s biggest
mall operator by assets, reported a 3 percent drop in first-half
funds from operations as A$4.9 billion ($4.4 billion) of asset
sales in 2012 and 2013 cut property income.  Westfield Group’s funds from operations slid to A$729
million in the six months to June 30 from A$751.2 million a year
earlier, the Sydney-based company said in a statement to the
Australian stock exchange. That compared with a forecast of
A$729.4 million, based on the median of three analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg News.  Westfield Group has been selling stakes in its malls to
investors and retaining management rights to boost income and
fund higher return activities including development. Australia’s
 biggest publicly-traded property trust  will boost investments
overseas, including in new markets, as growth at home slows, co-Chief Executive Officer  Peter Lowy  said in February.  Westfield plans “to continue redeploying capital from
further joint ventures and non-core asset disposals,” Peter and
Steven Lowy, joint-CEOs of Westfield Group, said in today’s
statement.  Westfield Group’s funds from operations equated to 33.1
cents a share, a 0.9 percent increase from a year earlier, as it
bought back 140.7 million shares since it announced its
repurchase program in February 2012.  Global Operations  Westfield Retail, which owns interests in its parent’s
Australian and New Zealand malls, reported first-half funds from
operations of A$300.5 million, or 9.93 cents a share, it said in
a separate statement. That compared with the A$297 million
median of three analyst estimates compiled by  Bloomberg News . A
1.8 percent increase in comparable net operating income and the
completion of redevelopments contributed to the increase, it
said.  Westfield Group  shares  slipped 0.7 percent to A$11.05 at
the close of trading in Sydney, while Westfield Retail  shares 
rose 0.3 percent to A$2.93. The  S&P/ASX 200 index  added 0.1
percent.  Westfield Group’s management income rose 7 percent to A$64
million, as the assets it manages surged 10 percent to 67.9
billion, it said today. Net property income fell 5 percent to
A$975 million, it said. After adjusting for the divestments, net
property income was up 6 percent.  Westfield Group’s comparable net income rose 4.3 percent in
the U.S., 1.8 percent in its  Australia  and New Zealand business
and 0.2 percent in the U.K., it said today.  U.S. Project  At Westfield London, the company is moving forward with an
expansion at the site, having received approval for more than
500,000 square feet (46,452 square meters) of additional space
and more than 1,500 apartments, Steven Lowy said today on an
analyst teleconference.  In its World Trade Center redevelopment in  New York 
“demand for that center is absolutely unprecedented” with
potential tenants including international luxury and high street
retailers, and expectations for 400,000 visitors a day, Lowy
said on the call. Westfield formed a joint venture in July 2011
with the  Port Authority  of New York and  New Jersey  to redevelop
the center.  In  Brazil , the company continues to review opportunities
after dissolving its joint venture with the Almeida Junior
Family in April, Lowy said today.  Westfield Group, which reported net income that fell 36
percent to A$514.8 million for the period, will pay a first-half
 dividend  of 25.5 Australian cents a share, it said today. Funds
from operations for the year to Dec. 31 are forecast to be 66.5
cents a share, it said.  Westfield Retail (WRT) , which today reported net income of
A$402.1 million for the half, forecast full-year funds from
operations of 19.85 cents a share, which it will pay out in its
entirety.  To contact the reporter on this story:
