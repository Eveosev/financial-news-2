Inner Mongolia Sanwei Resources
Group Co. , a Chinese producer of coal, silicon and magnesium,
plans to seek about $200 million in an initial public offering
in Hong Kong, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The company, based in Ordos city near  China ’s border with
Mongolia, has submitted an application to the Hong Kong stock
exchange and may start the share sale this year, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the information
is private.  BOC International Holdings Ltd., BNP Paribas SA, Credit
Suisse Group AG and Morgan Stanley are managing the offering,
the people said. Two calls to Inner Mongolia Sanwei’s head
office in Ordos went unanswered.  Companies have raised $5.9 billion in  Hong Kong  IPOs this
year, more than double the proceeds for the same period of 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Inner Mongolia Yitai
Coal Co. raised $903 million from a Hong Kong share sale in July
last year, Bloomberg data show. The company’s shares have fallen
29 percent from the offer price as coal prices slumped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
