U.S. officials aren’t limited to a one-day operation, an
administration official said as the U.K. drafted a United
Nations resolution to condemn last week’s suspected chemical
attack in Syria. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said
yesterday “we have the means to defend ourselves, and we will
surprise people with them.”  “We’re off the highs, but until we have a clear feeling on
how the aftermath of this potential strike in Syria will go, you
can’t afford to be short,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market
analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “All the major oil
producers are on opposite sides of the conflict.”  Gasoline for September delivery rose 3.89 cents, or 1.3

intraday price since July 22. Trading volume was 10 percent
above the 100-day average.  Syria Discussions  The U.S. and its allies are still working to define goals
for a military strike on Syria, said the official, who was
speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss war-planning
efforts. U.S. and British officials say there’s little doubt
that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces are responsible
for the chemical attacks near Damascus that opposition groups
say killed more than 1,300 people.  WTI for October delivery increased 83 cents to $109.84 a
