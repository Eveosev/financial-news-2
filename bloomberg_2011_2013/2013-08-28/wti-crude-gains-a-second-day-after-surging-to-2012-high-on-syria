West Texas Intermediate crude surged
to the highest level since May 2011 on concern that conflict in
 Syria  may spread and threaten oil supplies from the Middle East.
Brent climbed to a six-month high in London.  Futures gained as much as 3 percent in New York, while
gasoline extended its biggest jump in six weeks. The U.S.,
 France  and Britain moved closer to a military strike as they
laid the legal groundwork to justify action after Syria
allegedly used chemical weapons. Brent may rise to $150 a
barrel, from about $116 today, if conflict disrupts supply,
 Societe Generale SA (GLE)  said. Libya said output may have dropped
below 200,000 barrels a day, the lowest since the 2011 uprising
against Muammar Qaddafi.  “The geopolitical risk in Syria continues to dominate the
market,” said Myrto Sokou, an analyst in  London  at Sucden
Financial Ltd., a commodities broker. “We expect the recent
upside rally in the oil market to continue” amid the potential
for Middle Eastern supply disruptions, she said in an e-mailed
note today.  WTI for October delivery rose as much as $3.23 to $112.24 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest intraday price since May 3, 2011. It was
at $110.36 at 1:06 p.m. London time. The volume of all futures
traded more than twice the 100-day average. The contract
increased $3.09 to $109.01 yesterday, the highest close since
Feb. 24 last year. Prices are up about 20 percent in 2013.  Syria Fears  Brent for October settlement advanced as much as $2.98, or
2.6 percent, to $117.34 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange after settling yesterday at the highest since
Feb. 25. The European benchmark crude was at a premium of $5.34
to WTI from $5.35 yesterday.  Gasoline for September rose as much as 6.92 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $3.1033 on the Nymex after an increase of 2.8
percent yesterday that was the biggest since July 12.  The prospect of conflict is causing oil and U.S. equities
to move in opposite directions by the most in almost two years.
While WTI rallied 2.9 percent yesterday, the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index (SPX)  slid 1.6 percent, resulting in a 4.5 percentage-point
divergence that was the widest since November 2011, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  WTI call options surged as futures rallied, with the
implied volatility of October calls protecting against a 10
percent rise in futures prices jumping to 34.84 percent at 1:08
p.m. from 21.70 on Aug. 26.  Brent ’Spike’  Brent may “spike briefly” to $150 a barrel if the
conflict in Syria spreads to other parts of the Middle East,
causing supply cuts, Societe Generale said in a report e-mailed
today. A U.S.-led attack on Syria is possible within the next
week, the bank predicted. Brent traded at $147.50 on July 11,
2008, the highest intraday price on record.  “The concern is that an attack on Syria will reverberate
through the region, increasing the spillover into other
countries and possibly resulting in a larger supply disruption
elsewhere,” said  Michael Wittner , Societe Generale’s head of
oil market research in New York. Even if flows aren’t disrupted,
prices may climb to as high as $125 in coming days, he said.  Any armed response against Syria would focus narrowly on
the nation’s weapons capabilities and wouldn’t aim at deposing
President Bashar al-Assad, U.S. and U.K. officials said. The
Middle East accounted for 35 percent of global oil output in the
first quarter of this year, according to data from the
International Energy Agency.  Libya Output   “The market is really getting nervous,” analysts led by
 David Wech  at JBC Energy GmbH, a researcher in Vienna, said in a
note today. “The rhetoric emerging from key figures yesterday,
and the evident mobilisation of assets in the Eastern
Mediterranean region, would suggest that action of some kind is
imminent.”  Libya’s oil production fell to one-eighth of its capacity
as protests over pay and allegations of corruption spread to
fields operated by  Eni SpA (ENI)  and Repsol SA, according to officials
at National Oil Corp.  Brent’s rally may stall as a technical indicator shows
futures may be rising too quickly for further gains to be
sustainable. The 14-day relative strength index yesterday surged
above 70 for the first time since February, signaling the market
is overbought, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Today’s
reading is higher than 75.  Gasoline Inventories  U.S. gasoline inventories declined by 1.13 million barrels
in the week ended Aug. 23, the industry-funded American
Petroleum Institute said yesterday. An Energy Information
Administration report today may show supplies slid by 1.38
million, according to the  median estimate  of 12 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Crude stockpiles increased 2.47 million barrels, the API
said. The EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, will
probably report a gain of 750,000 barrels, the survey shows.  The API in  Washington  collects supply information on a
voluntary basis from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and
pipelines. The government requires that reports be filed with
the EIA for its weekly survey.  Hedge funds had cut bullish bets on WTI in the week to Aug.
20, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed on
Aug. 23. Funds and other speculators had boosted bullish bets on
Brent in the same period, data from the ICE Futures Europe
showed on Aug. 26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
