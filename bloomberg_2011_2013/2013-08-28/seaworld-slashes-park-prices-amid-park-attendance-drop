SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. (SEAS)  fell to
its lowest level since the stock began trading in April after it
slashed ticket prices amid a drop in attendance.  The Orlando, Florida-based company, which sold $807 million
in shares in an initial public offering, dropped 6.5 percent to
$29.70 at the close in  New York , its lowest price since the
company went public on April 19. The decline pared SeaWorld’s
increase over the $27-a-share IPO price to 10 percent.  SeaWorld’s original park in  San Diego  is  offering  area
residents a free kid’s ticket with an adult ticket purchase
midweek, a $71 value, according to its website. SeaWorld Orlando
cut $42 off the price of a midweek ticket, a 46 percent
 discount , if purchased in advance online.  The current promotions are a reaction to consumer demand
and part of an effort to fill parks on weekdays, Fred Jacobs, a
spokesman for SeaWorld, said in an e-mail. Attendance fell 9
percent in the second quarter, mainly because of higher prices
instituted earlier this year, bad weather and the timing of
Easter on the calendar, Chief Financial Officer James Heaney
said earlier this month when the company reported its results.  “I’ve never seen a SeaWorld promotion that aggressive in
the 10-plus years I’ve been listing SeaWorld coupons and
deals,” said Mary Waring, who runs the MouseSavers.com website
for theme park visitors. She said the  Orlando  discount started
this month.  Pricing Strategy  SeaWorld is also getting negative publicity from a critical
documentary over the use of killer whales in its theme parks.
“Blackfish,”  released  in U.S. theaters on July 19, began
attracting attention after its premiere at the Sundance Film
Festival in January.  “We can attribute no attendance impact at all to the
movie,” Jacobs said.  SeaWorld, which owns 11 parks in five states, introduced a
new ticketing strategy this year that involved higher prices and
less reliance on third-party distributors. SeaWorld Orlando
increased its single-day ticket price three times, or 12
percent, to $92 in June from $82 in July 2012, according to the
Orlando Sentinel.  The June price increase put SeaWorld Orlando on a par with
neighboring attractions at  Universal Studios  and below  Walt
Disney Co. (DIS) ’s Magic Kingdom, Jacobs said.  “We are continually refining our consumer offers and have
various types of ticket packages in the marketplace at all
times,” Jacobs said.  ‘Sobering Year’  “Blackfish” argues that killer whales shouldn’t be held
in captivity, and that the company ignored warning signs of the
danger to handlers. SeaWorld has countered with a detailed
critique of the film, calling it “a dishonest movie” in a
statement distributed to critics and refuting many of its
conclusions.  Videos posted recently on the Internet of a dolphin and a
pilot whale left out of water at SeaWorld parks in  San Antonio 
and Orlando may also be affecting public attitudes, according to
“Blackfish” director  Gabriela Cowperthwaite .  “It’s been a sobering year for SeaWorld,” Cowperthwaite
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. “It’s likely people
are realizing that nothing at that place is what it seems. The
jig is up.”  The animals in the videos were never in danger and were
tended to quickly, SeaWorld said in a statement yesterday.  “There is no higher priority for SeaWorld than the safety
of guests and staff and the welfare of our animals,” the
company said.  Ticket Discounts  SeaWorld said on Aug. 13 that its parks welcomed about
600,000 fewer visitors in the quarter that ended June 30, and
overall revenue fell 3.4 percent to $411.3 million. The company
lowered its full-year revenue forecast by $10 million to a range
of $1.45 billion to $1.48 billion.  SeaWorld’s ticket discounts and the partial closure of
dining options at its Busch Gardens Tampa park indicate that
attendance is down, according to Dennis Speigel, president of
International Theme Park Services Inc., a consulting firm in
Cincinnati. The visitor numbers are surprising given that in May
the company opened Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin, its
largest investment in a new attraction to date, at SeaWorld
Orlando, Speigel said.  “When you’re seeing those kinds of discounts in the first
part of August, that’s telling you attendance is off,” Speigel
said. “Something didn’t gel.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
