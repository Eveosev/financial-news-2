Prime Minister  David Cameron  said
the U.K. will put forward a draft resolution at the United
Nations today authorizing action to protect civilians after last
week’s suspected chemical-weapons attack near Damascus, for
which it’s blamed the Syrian government.  “We have always made clear that we want the UN  Security
Council  to live up to its responsibilities on Syria,” Cameron
said on his Twitter feed. “Today we are giving its permanent
members the opportunity to do that.”  The U.S., France and Britain have put forces into
place after the attack near Damascus, which killed as many as
1,300 people, according to opposition groups.  The U.K. opposition  Labour Party  has said it wants the UN
to be consulted before it supports a vote in Parliament tomorrow
night on the possible use of force. In Britain, decisions about
action are overshadowed by the 2003 invasion of  Iraq , which took
place without UN support.  On Aug. 26, Cameron spoke by phone to Russian President
 Vladimir Putin . The two men disagreed whether there’s enough
evidence to support Britain’s view that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad’s government was responsible for the attack, according
to Cameron’s office. Russia has a veto in the Security Council
and can block any resolution.  According to Cameron’s office, the resolution will be one
“authorizing all necessary measures under Chapter 7 of the UN
Charter to protect civilians from chemical weapons.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
