Sembcorp Industries Ltd. (SCI) , the
largest utility in  Southeast Asia , is expanding operations in
China with water-treatment projects at two industrial parks in
Liaoning province.  The wastewater-treatment works to be developed at Panjin
Fine Chemical Industrial Park and Panjin Liaodong Bay New
District will cost about S$62.7 million ($49 million),
Singapore-based Sembcorp said today in a statement.  Panjin Fine Chemical Industrial Park is in Panjin City,
where China’s third-biggest oil field, Liaohe Oil Field, is
located, it said. Sembcorp also owns and operates the Fujairah 1
water and power plant, one of the world’s largest hybrid
desalination plants, in the United Arab Emirates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
