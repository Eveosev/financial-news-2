Rupiah forwards gained by the most
in more than six weeks and  government bonds  declined on
speculation the central bank will raise  interest rates  tomorrow.  Bank Indonesia ’s  board of governors  will convene for an
extra meeting to evaluate economic, monetary and banking
conditions, the central said in a statement yesterday. It kept
its  reference rate  unchanged at the previous monthly meeting on
Aug. 15 as growth slowed to the least since 2010 in the second
quarter. Bank  Indonesia  increased borrowing costs by 75 basis
points in June and July to 6.5 percent. Inflation rose to a
four-year high of 8.6 percent last month from a year earlier.  “Market confidence is the issue as the central bank’s
stance has been ambiguous between seeking growth or seeking
macroeconomic stability, so a rate move would be positive,”
said David Sumual, chief economist at PT Bank Central Asia, the
nation’s largest lender by market value. “The rupiah’s weakness
has likely snowballed into imported inflation, which adds to
reasons for raising rates.”  The one-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.9 percent
in the biggest rise since July 19 to 11,597 per dollar as of
9:35 a.m. in Jakarta, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
contracts traded at a 5.7 percent discount to the spot rate,
which declined 0.1 percent to 10,938, the weakest level since
April 2009, according to prices from local banks.  A  fixing  used to settle the forwards set by the Association
of Banks in  Singapore  was set at 11,196 yesterday. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, dropped 18 basis points, or 0.18
percentage point, to 19.56 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Bank Indonesia will likely increase the benchmark interest
rate by 50 basis points to 7 percent by the year-end, as
inflation in August may be 9.2 percent, which would be the
fastest pace since 2008, Bank Central Asia’s Sumual said.  The yield on government bonds due May 2023 climbed one
basis point to 8.75 percent, the highest since February 2011,
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
