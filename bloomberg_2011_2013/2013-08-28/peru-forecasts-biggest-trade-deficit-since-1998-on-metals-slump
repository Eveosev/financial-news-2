Peru  will posts its widest trade
deficit in 15 years in 2013 after a drop in metal exports,
dimming the outlook for economic  growth , the government said.  Exports will fall 8 percent to $42 billion, resulting in a
$720 million  trade gap , the  Finance Ministry  said in a report
published in state newspaper El Peruano today. The Andean nation
had a $4.5 billion surplus last year.  The price of copper, which accounts for about a quarter of
Peru’s exports, has dropped 9.6 percent this year, damping
private investment in the world’s third largest exporter of the
metal. The economy expanded 4.4 percent in June, the second
slowest pace in more than three years, while the Peruvian sol
has dropped 9.2 percent against the dollar in 2013.  Reduced Chinese demand has “prompted a significant fall in
the prices of the raw materials we export,” Finance Minister
Miguel Castilla said in Congress today. “The data we see allows
us to say 2014 will be better. The world should keep
recovering.”  Stronger global growth and Peru’s increased copper
production will fuel a rebound in exports next year, Castilla
said.  The government forecasts the economy will expand 5.7
percent in 2013 and about 6 percent next year, the fastest in
 South America . The mining and hydrocarbons industries will each
expand 10 percent in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
