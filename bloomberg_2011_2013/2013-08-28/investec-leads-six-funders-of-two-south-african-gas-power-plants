(Corrects quote to show bank is one of lead arrangers in
second paragraph.)  Investec Plc (INVP)  will lead the financing
of two South African gas power plants developed by GDF Suez that
will generate more than 1,000 megawatts as part of the country’s
9.7 billion rand ($933 million) independent producer program.  “We’re one of the coordinating lead arrangers,” Robert Gecelter, a member of Investec’s Project and Infrastructure
Finance team, said by phone. “Investec is one of six lenders in
the syndicate and we provide a little more than the average
amount to the project.”  The 670-megawatt Avon gas plant in KwaZulu-Natal is due to
start generating in 2016 and the 335-megawatt Dedisa plant in
Eastern Cape a year earlier, Investec said in a statement after
the banks closed the funding.  GDF Suez (GSZ)  is the main developer of
the plants, to be operated under 15-year power purchase accords
with state utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., Investec said.  The country is seeking to reduce its reliance on coal-fired
power, with 80 percent of its current 41,900-megawatt capacity
coming from the  fossil fuel , according to Eskom.  South Africa 
also plans to add 3,725 megawatts of generating capacity from
renewable sources by 2016 through a program of five tenders.  Investec didn’t identify the other five lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
