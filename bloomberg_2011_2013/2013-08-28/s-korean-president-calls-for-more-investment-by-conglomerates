South Korean President Park Geun Hye
called on the heads of the country’s biggest industrial
companies to increase investment and promised she would prevent
regulations from obstructing their business activities.  Park met today with Lee Kun Hee of  Samsung Group ,  Chung
Mong Koo  of Hyundai Motor Co. and the heads of eight other large
industrial groups, according to an e-mailed statement from the
president’s office.  Park said she sees signs of an economic recovery and told
the executives that “aggressive and pre-emptive investment”
has increased corporate competitiveness and helped improve the
national economy in the past, according to the e-mail.  Huh Chang Soo, head of GS Group, acknowledged investment by
the top 30 conglomerates in the country fell short of their
initial plan and told Park that they would increase investment
to 6 trillion won ($5.4 billion) to 155 trillion won this year,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
