Natural gas futures rose in New York
on speculation that a heat wave in the eastern U.S. this week
will spur fuel demand before the weather turns cooler.  Futures for September delivery gained as much as 0.7
percent to $3.56 per million British thermal units in electronic
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange and were at $3.558
at 9:47 a.m. Singapore time. The contract settled 0.6 percent
higher at $3.534 yesterday.  Forecasts showed unusually hot weather will linger across
the lower 48 states over the next five days, according to MDA
Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  The high temperature in New York City and  Chicago  on Sept.
4 may be 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 Celsius), 4 below normal for
both cities, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in State College,
 Pennsylvania . Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S.
gas demand, according to the Energy Information Administration,
the Energy Departmentâ€™s statistical arm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
