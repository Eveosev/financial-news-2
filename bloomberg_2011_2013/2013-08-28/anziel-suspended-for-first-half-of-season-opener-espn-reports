Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel
is suspended for the first half of the school’s season opening
football game against Rice University, ESPN reported, citing a
person familiar with the situation.  The National Collegiate Athletic Association has been
investigating whether the Heisman Trophy winner was paid for
autographs by a memorabilia dealer.  Alan Cannon, a spokesman in the Texas A&M athletic
department, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail message
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
