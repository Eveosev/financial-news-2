OAO Rostelecom dropped to the lowest
level in six weeks after Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its
recommendation on the state-run telecommunications operator’s
stock to the equivalent of sell.  Rostelecom tumbled as much as 2.7 percent and traded down 2
percent at 108.76 rubles by 1:31 p.m. in Moscow, the lowest
intraday level since July 16. The amount of securities trading
was equivalent to about 31 percent of the three-month average.
Shares are down 9.6 percent this year.  BofA Merrill Lynch  cut the stock  from neutral to
underperform and lowered the price estimate to 100 rubles an
ordinary share, according to today’s report. Rostelecom’s merger
with OAO Svyazinvest, the start of its mobile network and a
potential buyout of Tele2 Russia may boost capital expediture
and increase leverage while diverting management’s attention,
according to the report.  “The company is clearly in transition, being pulled in
different directions by its fixed-line and mobile strategies,”
BofA analysts, including Haim  Israel , said in the e-mailed note.  VTB Group plans to sell Tele2 Russia within a year and has
looked at Rostelecom among potential buyers, a deal that would
make it the country’s fourth major wireless operator, Prime
newswire reported in June, citing the bank’s Chairman Andrey Kostin. Rostelecom’s acquisition of Tele2  Russia  may pressure
its balance sheet, signal more investments and present operating
challenges, according to BofA analysts.  Rostelecom dropped 0.7 percent to $19.71 in London trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
