Texas and the western U.S. are
expected to heat up by the second week of September while East
Coast temperatures stay seasonal, said  Matt Rogers , president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Much of the West may reach 3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7
Celsius) above normal, while northern Texas and parts of the
Pacific Northwest may have reading 5 degrees higher from Sept. 7
to Sept. 11, Rogers said.  “The heat ridge shifts west, but it also lingers over the
south-central U.S. to give Texas some hotter risks,” Rogers,
based in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a note to clients today  Energy traders look to long-range forecasts to gauge
potential fuel use. Above-normal temperatures in the large
population areas can increase energy demand as people turn to
air conditioning to cool homes and businesses.  Most of the U.S. east of the  Mississippi River  is expected
to have near-seasonal temperatures from Sept. 2 to Sept. 11,
Rogers said.  The Great Lakes region, including Chicago, which was
gripped this week by a heat wave, may have temperatures dip 1 to
3 degrees below normal from Sept. 2 to Sept. 6, according to  MDA
Weather Services  in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  The normal average temperature in  New York  City on Sept. 6
is 73 degrees, according to MDA. In Boston it’s 68; in Chicago,
69;  St. Louis , 75; Houston, 83; Seattle, 64; and in Burbank,
California, 75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
