Light Louisiana Sweet and other  Gulf
of Mexico  crudes strengthened relative to West Texas
Intermediate on concerns that the conflict in  Syria  might spread
and threaten waterborne oil supplies.  The U.S.,  France  and Britain moved closer to a military
strike as they laid the legal groundwork to justify action over
Syriaâ€™s alleged use of chemical weapons. Brent, the European
benchmark, may advance to $150 a barrel if supplies are
disrupted,  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  said.  Brent strengthened to a premium of as much as $6.17 a
barrel more than WTI, the highest intraday level in a week. LLS
and other gulf crudes compete with foreign oils priced against
Brent for space in U.S. refineries.  LLS, the light, sweet benchmark on the  Gulf Coast ,
strengthened by 45 cents to a premium of $3.25 a barrel over WTI
at 9:25 a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet gained 25 cents to a premium of $3.15.  LLS also strengthened against Mexican Maya crude, the
heavy, sour benchmark on the Gulf Coast, gaining 55 cents to
$10.29 a barrel, the highest level since Aug. 19. The LLS-Maya
differential is an indication of how profitable heavy Gulf Coast
refineries are.  Mars Blend, a medium, sour crude from the Gulf,
strengthened by 30 cents versus WTI to a discount of $2.40 a
barrel. Poseidon crude narrowed its discount by 60 cents to
$3.40 a barrel.  Crude from the Southern Green Canyon strengthened by 25
cents to $3.90 a barrel less than WTI. Thunder Horse crude was
unchanged at 10 cents a barrel more than WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
