Kot Addu Power Co.,  Pakistan ’s
biggest electricity producer, reported a 20 percent increase in
full-year profit because of lower finance costs.  Net income climbed to 7.35 billion rupees ($71 million), or
8.35 rupees a share, in the 12 months ended June 30 from 6.1
billion rupees, or 6.90 rupees, a year earlier, the Lahore-based
company said today in a filing to the  Karachi Stock Exchange .
Sales fell 2.8 percent to 97.7 billion rupees.  The company’s interest costs fell to 8 billion rupees from
9.8 billion rupees a year earlier, according to the statement.
Kot Addu, which purchases fuel from Pakistan State Oil Co. to
run its generators, reduced its credit dependence on the
nation’s biggest fuel retailer and moved to borrowing from banks,
said Zoya Ahmed, an analyst at Karachi-based brokerage BMA
Capital Management Ltd.  “The company effectively skewed its borrowings toward
banks rather than standing payables against Pakistan State Oil
that offer higher rates and charges a credit on Kot Addu’s
payables,” said Ahmed, who has a buy rating for Kot Addu stock.  Kot Addu plans to pay a final cash dividend of 4.5 rupees a
share.  The company owes Pakistan State Oil about 28 billion rupees
as of March 31, Ahmed said. Kot Addu operates a 1,600 megawatt
plant that can use furnace oil, natural gas and diesel to
generate electricity, which is sold to the state-run  Water &
Power Development Authority .  Kot Addu rose 1.3 percent to 59.46 rupees at the end of
trade in Karachi. The stock has climbed 20 percent this year,
compared with a 33 percent gain in the benchmark KSE100 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
