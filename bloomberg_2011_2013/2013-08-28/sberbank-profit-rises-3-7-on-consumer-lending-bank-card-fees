OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s largest
lender, said second-quarter profit rose 3.7 percent on higher
fee income and lending to households.  Net income in the quarter advanced to 86.5 billion rubles
($2.6 billion) from 83.4 billion rubles in the same period last
year, the Moscow-based bank said in a  statement  today, just
below the 86.9 billion-ruble average estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sberbank, Europe’s sixth-largest bank by market value, said
bank cards were the “key driver” of its fee income in the
first half. The lender has benefited as Russian purchasing power
has increased, with consumer spending accelerating in July as
unemployment unexpectedly fell and inflation eased.  The acquisition of  Turkey ’s  DenizBank AS (DENIZ)  in the third
quarter of last year also brought “a significant volume of
operating income,” the bank said.  Net interest income, the difference between what a bank
earns from lending and what it pays on deposits, rose to 174.8
billion rubles in the quarter from 165.8 billion rubles for the
same period a year ago. The share of non-performing loans
remained unchanged at 3.2 percent of total lending.  Consumer lending gained 11 percent to 3.15 trillion rubles
in the quarter, while corporate lending rose 4.2 percent to 8.57
trillion rubles. For the first half, fee and commission income
jumped 24.5 percent to 97.5 billion rubles.  Shares Slip  Sberbank’s  shares  slipped 1 percent to 89.15 rubles at 2:12
p.m. in Moscow, compared with a decline of 0.4 percent for the
Micex Index.  The bank said it has set aside 30.9 billion rubles against
potential bad loans, up from 2.1 billion rubles a year ago.  Jason Hurwitz, a senior analyst at Alfa Bank in Moscow who
rates Sberbank overweight, said the lender will withstand
slowing growth in corporate and consumer lending, “as long as
it’s not abrupt,” which would expose more bad loans.  Interest, fee and commission income accounted for 78
percent of total operating income before provisions for loan
impairments.  Sberbank’s return on equity slumped to 20.8 percent from
26.1 percent a year ago. Its Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio, a
measure of financial strength, increased to 10.5 percent from
10.4 percent six months ago. Total capital adequacy increased to
13.9 percent from 13.7 percent at the start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
