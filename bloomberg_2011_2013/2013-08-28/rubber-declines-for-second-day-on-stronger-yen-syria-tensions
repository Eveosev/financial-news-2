Rubber fell a second day as Japan’s
currency maintained its biggest gain in two months amid concern
that the U.S. will take military action against  Syria .  Rubber for delivery in January on  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange
retreated as much as 1.4 percent to 271.7 yen a kilogram ($2,795
a metric ton) and was 273.6 yen at 11:16 a.m. local time. The
contract for delivery in February, which started trading today,
was at 275.8 yen.  The yen traded at 97.08 per dollar after climbing 1.5
percent yesterday. Asian stocks fell a second day as President
 Barack Obama  works with allies including the U.K. and  France  to
reach agreement on limited action against Syria after concluding
the regime used chemical weapons on civilians. The stronger
Japanese currency reduces the appeal of yen-based contracts.  “It’s risk-off mode amid concerns of possible U.S.
military action on Syria,” said Naohiro Niimura, a partner at
research company Market Risk Advisory Co. in Tokyo. “The
stronger yen also hurt rubber.”  Thailand’s rubber policy committee will consider ways to
support the industry, including a proposal by farmers to buy
sheet at 80 baht per kilogram, said Pakdiharn Himathongkham, a
government spokesman, yesterday. About 450 protesters blocked a
road and rail line in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, demanding
the government buy rubber at above-market rates.  Rubber for delivery in January climbed 0.5 percent to
20,795  yuan  ($3,398) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Thai rubber free-on-board gained 0.6 percent to 84.45 baht
($2.62) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
