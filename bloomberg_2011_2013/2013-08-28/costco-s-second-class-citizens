Apropos of yesterday’s post on Costco, Wal-Mart and Trader Joe’s,  Ira Stoll  passes on the following piece of information, which I hadn’t known about: According to the linked article, these demonstrators make up about 10 percent of Costco’s in-store workforce. I had no idea that they didn’t work for Costco. It seems that the majority of people who I interact with on a Costco trip actually work for someone else -- captive contractors who exist to provide demonstration staff for Costco stores. Presumably, it’s set up this way because Costco only wants the demo folks on weekends and a few other high-traffic public holiday days. Costco proper offers a weekend wage differential, but according to the California website that ran the original story, the demonstrators don’t. Ironically, they’d probably be better off working at Sam’s Club, where they’d get some benefits -- and a chance to advance within a big retailer.
