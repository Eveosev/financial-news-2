Tropical Storm Juliette was
approaching Cabo San Lucas,  Mexico , and was forecast to move
across the resort town over the next few hours, the U.S.
National Hurricane Center said.  The system was about 40 miles (64 kilometers) southeast of
Cabo San Lucas, moving northwest at 25 miles per hour with top
sustained winds of 45 mph, according to a center  advisory  at
about 7:30 p.m.  New York  time. The storm has prompted warnings
from San Evaristo to Bahia Magdalena, according to the advisory.  “Juliette is a very small cyclone with tropical-storm-force winds extending out only 30 to 40 miles east of the
center,” Daniel Brown, a senior hurricane specialist at the
center in Miami, wrote in a forecast analysis.  Juliette is the 10th storm of the eastern Pacific hurricane
season, which runs from May 15 to Nov. 30. It is projected to
brush the western coast of Baja California before drifting into
the Pacific and dissipating.  “The tropical storm does not have much time in which to
strengthen before it interacts with the southern Baja Peninsula
and reaches the cooler waters and more stable air mass west of
the peninsula,” Brown said. “The cyclone should become a
remnant low in about 48 hours.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
