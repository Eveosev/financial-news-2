Oleg Melentyev, who is departing
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , will join Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank
AG as head of U.S. credit strategy in  New York .  Melentyev will report to Dominic Konstam, global head of
rates research, according to an e-mailed statement today.  “Oleg will play a critical role in supporting Deutsche
Bank’s U.S. credit research, supporting our ongoing commitment
to the sector,” Konstam said in the statement. “Oleg is well-versed in macroeconomic issues and bottom-up credit analysis,
making him the perfect candidate for this role.”  Melentyev didn’t immediately return a telephone message
seeking comment. He joined Merrill Lynch & Co. in 2001,
according to  records  from the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender by
assets, bought Merrill Lynch in 2009. Michelle Falkenstein, a
spokeswoman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America,
confirmed the departure yesterday and declined to comment
further.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. is the biggest  U.S. bank  by assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
