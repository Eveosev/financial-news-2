India  may install more wind capacity
than the U.S. this year for the first time as a tax-benefit
window extending to 2015 prompts U.S. developers to delay
setting up new projects.  India is forecast to put up 2,050 megawatts of wind
capacity in 2013, compared with the 2,000 megawatts expected in
the U.S., according to the latest figures from Bloomberg New
Energy Finance due to be published next week.  “The decline in the U.S. is mainly due to the complacency
of the project developers,” which can claim federal tax
benefits through 2015, said Shantanu Jaiswal, a New Delhi-based
BNEF wind analyst.  While all major wind markets, including  China , are expected
to slow this year, the U.S. is set to experience the sharpest
decline with annual installations plunging 85 percent. India’s
lead could be short-lived with U.S. installations expected to
surge again starting 2014, Jaiswal said.  India has installed 19,662 megawatts of wind power,
according to the Ministry of New and  Renewable Energy , about
one-fifth of the nation’s estimated potential, he said.  “There exists a substantial upside potential for Indian
wind installations in the coming years,” he said.  The country’s 10 largest developers, including  Mytrah
Energy Ltd. (MYT) , Green Infra Ltd. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.-
backed ReNew Wind Power Pvt., have plans to put up 15,000
megawatts of capacity in the next 10 years, driven by increasing
demand for electricity and wind power prices that are
competitive with new coal plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
