London was the destination for
almost 50 percent of  Middle East  investment in European
commercial property in the first half as political stability and
growth prospects attracted buyers,  CBRE Group Inc. (CBG)  said.  The Middle East accounted for 9 percent of all commercial
real estate bought in Europe during the period, up from 6
percent a year earlier. The region’s share of foreign investment
on the continent increased to 21 percent from 12 percent.  North
America  was the biggest investor, with 13 percent of the total
and 24 percent of the forieign share.  “London remains the destination of choice for foreign
investors due to its solid growth potential and its status as a
global financial hub, alongside its stable political environment
and a transparent legal system,” Nick Maclean, Middle East
managing director at CBRE, wrote in the report.  Almost half of the Middle East investment in  Europe  comes
from the region’s sovereign wealth funds, according to the
report. Foriegn investors accounted for 44 percent of all
European commercial property transactions, up from 40 percent a
year earlier. Cross-border investments within Europe declined to
16 percent of transactions, compared with 20 percent through
2011 and 2012, CBRE said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
