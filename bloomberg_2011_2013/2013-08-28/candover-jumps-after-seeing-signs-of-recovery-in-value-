Candover Investments Plc (CDI)  rose in
London trading after saying it sees “encouraging signs” of a
recovery in value of some of its holdings in the first half.  The firm wrote up its holding in Expro International by
13.9 million pounds ($22 million), helping to increase the value
of its portfolio by 8 percent,  London-based Candover said in a
statement today. It wrote down the value of its holding in
Stork, which provides inspection, assessment and repair services
to the  energy industry , by 12 million pounds.  “There are some encouraging signs of a recovery in value
within parts of the portfolio,” Chief Executive Officer Malcolm Fallen said. “Returning cash to shareholders as soon as
practicable remains our overriding objective.”  The shares  climbed  2.8 percent to 406 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
