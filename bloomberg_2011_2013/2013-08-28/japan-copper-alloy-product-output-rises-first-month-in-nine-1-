Japan ’s output of copper and copper-alloy fabricated products climbed 1.6 percent in July from a
year earlier, gaining for the first time in nine months as
demand for exports increased, an industry group said.  Production, including sheets and tubes, was 69,670 metric
tons last month, compared with 68,572 tons a year ago, the Japan
Copper & Brass Association said today, citing preliminary data.
Output fell 3.7 percent to 66,359 tons in June.  Japan’s overall exports jumped by the most since 2010 in
July, aiding Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to drive an
economic recovery even as rising energy costs boosted the trade
deficit. The stronger exports show Japan’s economy is benefiting
from a recovery in demand in  Europe  and the U.S., and the yen’s
11 percent decline against the dollar this year.  Domestic demand continued declining last month, falling 1.3
percent to 56,864 tons from a year earlier, while export demand
jumped 16.9 percent to 12,806 tons, the highest level since May
2011, the industry group said.  Copper wire and cable shipments climbed 3.8 percent to
61,800 tons in July from a year earlier, the highest level since
November as demand from the construction and electric-machinery
industries gained, the  Japanese Electric Wire & Cable Makers’
Association  said on Aug. 20. Deliveries were 54,087 tons in June,
down 5.6 percent from a year earlier.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose 0.2 percent to $7,327 a ton at 11:15 a.m. in  Tokyo 
and has lost 7.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
