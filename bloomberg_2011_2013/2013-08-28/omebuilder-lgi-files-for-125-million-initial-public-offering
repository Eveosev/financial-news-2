LGI Homes Inc., a builder of homes
for first-time buyers, filed for a U.S. initial public offering.  LGI, which builds houses in Texas,  Arizona , Florida and
 Georgia , will seek as much as $125 million in the offering,
according to a regulatory filing today. The amount is a
placeholder used to calculate fees and will probably change.  Homebuilder  confidence  surged in August to the highest
level since November 2005, as the U.S. housing market recovers
from its worst crash since the 1930s. Re/Max Holdings Inc., a
real estate brokerage franchiser, filed for an IPO earlier this
month.  LGI, which focuses on converting renters into buyers, has
been profitable every year since it began operations in 2003,
according to the filing. The company had revenue of $96 million
in the six months through June.  The sale is being managed by Deutsche Bank AG, JMP
Securities LLC, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. LGI, based in The
Woodlands,  Texas , plans to list its shares under the ticker
LGIH.  To contact the reporter on this story:
