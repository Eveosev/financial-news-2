Migros Ticaret AS (MGROS)  tumbled to the
lowest level in 14 months as the lira weakened to a record low,
boosting speculation the Turkish grocery operator will report
more losses.  The  shares  slid 4.2 percent to 15.95 liras at the close in
Istanbul, the lowest level since June 2012. The number of shares
traded was 161 percent of the stock’s three-month daily average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Borsa Istanbul
National 100 (XU100)  index retreated 0.1 percent.  Turkey ’s lira depreciated 0.8 percent to 2.7464 per euro at
5:45 p.m., extending its year-to-date decline to 15 percent, the
third-worst among emerging-market currencies monitored by
Bloomberg. Migros foreign-exchange losses surged to 154.6
million liras ($75 million) in the three months through June,
from 17.3 million liras a year earlier, company filings showed
Aug. 22.  “A depreciating lira may continue to hurt” the company’s
financial results, Burak Isyar, an analyst at Burgan Securities
in Istanbul, said in a phone interview today. “Investors may be
anticipating a repeat of what happened in the second quarter.”  Istanbul-based Migros reported a  loss  of 160.8 million
liras in the second quarter, compared with a profit of 72.9
million liras a year ago.  Migros, owned by private-equity firm BC Partners Ltd.,
slumped 26 percent this year, compared with the 16 percent drop
in the benchmark equity index. Nineteen analysts recommend
buying the shares, while four say hold and three sell, according
to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
