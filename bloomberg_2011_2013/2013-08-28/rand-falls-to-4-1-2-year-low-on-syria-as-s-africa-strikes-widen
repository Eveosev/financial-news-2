South Africa ’s rand weakened to a 4
1/2-year low as strikes spread across the continent’s biggest
economy and the U.S. and its allies moved closer to attacking
 Syria , fanning concern capital outflows will accelerate.  South Africa may face strikes involving as many as 335,000
workers after deadlocks in wage talks between employers and the
country’s biggest labor unions spread to gas stations and  car
dealerships . The U.S.,  France  and the U.K. are considering
limited military action against Syria after concluding the
regime used chemical weapons against civilians. The tension has
worsened a rout that’s seen global funds pull out of emerging-markets on bets the  Federal Reserve  will pare stimulus.  “While all  emerging markets  remain under pressure, the
rand has the additional pressure of the possibility of wide
spread and significant labor action,” Mohammed Nalla, head of
strategic research at Nedbank Group Ltd., said in an e-mailed
note to clients today.  The currency fell as much as 1.2 percent to 10.5096 per
dollar, the weakest intraday level since March 2009. It was
trading 0.8 percent lower at 10.4684 per dollar as of 8:03 a.m.
in Johannesburg, extending losses this year to 19 percent, the
worst of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Yields on 10-year bonds increased 4 basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
to 8.36 percent after jumping 10 basis points yesterday.  The spot price of Brent crude oil jumped 2.3 percent to
$116.99 per barrel, the highest level since Feb. 19 for the
generic contract. South Africa imports 70 percent of its oil
needs. Foreign investors have sold a net 1.68 billion rand ($161
