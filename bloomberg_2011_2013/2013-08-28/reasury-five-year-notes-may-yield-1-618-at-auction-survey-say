The Treasury Department’s $35
billion sale of five-year notes may draw a yield of 1.618
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of eight of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in August 2018, yielded 1.62
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York 
time. Last month’s sale of the securities yielded 1.41 percent,
compared with 1.48 percent the month before, the highest since
July 2011. The size of today’s offering is the same as the past
35 sales of five-year notes after peaking at $42 billion from
November 2009 through April 2010.  The July 24 offering’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.46. The average for the past 10 auctions was 2.74.  Indirect bidders, a class of investor that includes foreign
central banks, bought 53.9 percent of the notes at the July
sale, the most since November 2009. The average for the past 10
auctions is 44.2 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 8.3 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 15.9
percent at the past 10.  Five-year notes have lost 2.6 percent this year, versus a
loss of 3.1 percent for Treasuries overall, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. The five-year securities returned
2.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries overall rose 2.2 percent.  Today’s offering is the second of three note auctions this
week totaling $98 billion. The government sold $34 billion in
two-year debt yesterday at a yield of 0.386 percent, and will
sell $29 billion in seven-year securities tomorrow.  The sales will raise $38.1 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $59.9 billion, according to
the  U.S. Treasury .  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
