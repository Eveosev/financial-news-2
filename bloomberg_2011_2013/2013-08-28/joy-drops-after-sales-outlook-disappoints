Joy Global Inc. (JOY) , the largest maker
of underground mining equipment, dropped in pre-market trading
after it projected a decline in sales amid a slowdown in demand
growth for metals and coal.  Joy declined 5.5 percent to $48.49 at 8:55 a.m. before the
start of regular trading in New York.  While it maintained a sales forecast of $4.9 billion to $5
billion in the fiscal year ending Oct. 31, “the current outlook
is unlikely to support annual revenue above $4 billion,”
Milwaukee-based Joy said today in its third-quarter earnings
statement. That trails the $4.59 billion average of 19 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg for the 2014 fiscal year.  “Conditions in our end markets are dominated by supply
surplus and reduced demand growth for most commodities,” Chief
Executive Officer Mike Sutherlin said in the statement. “The
market will continue to be more challenging before it starts to
improve.”  Third-quarter net income excluding one-time items was $1.70
a share, beating the $1.36 average of 20 estimates. Revenue
dropped 4.9 percent to $1.32 billion, beating the $1.18 billion
average estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
