CEZ AS defied a global stock selloff
as a planned addition of the biggest Czech power utility to a
developed-markets benchmark boosted buying.  The shares rose 0.7 percent to 457 koruna by 1:55 p.m. in
 Prague , paring this year’s slump to 33 percent. CEZ’s home  PX (PX) 
index fell 0.6 percent while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, which
it’s scheduled to join next month, retreated 1 percent on
concern the U.S. would take military action against  Syria .  CEZ and Komercni Banka AS, a unit of Societe Generale SA,
will be the first Czech companies to join the western European
gauge from Sept. 23, Stoxx Ltd.  said  yesterday. The move follows
a reclassification of the country as a developed market by the
index provider, according to the statement.  “This fact should increase the attractiveness of the
companies for investors tracking indexes and it should also
increase liquidity,” analysts at J&T Banka AS led by Milan Vanicek wrote in a report to clients today.  Komercni Banka  dropped 0.5 percent, compared with a 1.4
percent drop for 16 sector  peers  tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
