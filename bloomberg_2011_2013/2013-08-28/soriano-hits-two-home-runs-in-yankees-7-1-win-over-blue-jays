Alfonso Soriano hit two home runs
and drove in four runs as the New York Yankees defeated the
Toronto Blue Jays 7-1.  Derek Jeter , playing in his second Major League Baseball
game since his return from the disabled list, hit a run-scoring
single in the first inning last night at Rogers Centre in
Toronto. Soriano then gave the Yankees a 4-0 lead with a three-run homer in the first and added a solo home run in the third.  Mark Reynolds hit a home run in the sixth inning and  Alex Rodriguez  blasted a homer, his second in two nights, in the
seventh for the Yankees.  Rodriguez has 651 home runs, nine shy of Willie Mays’s
total. The third baseman would get $6 million bonuses for tying
Mays at 660,  Babe Ruth  at 714, Hank Aaron at 755 and  Barry Bonds 
at 762, and for setting the career home run record at 763,
Sports Illustrated said.  Kevin Pillar hit a run-scoring double in the eighth for the
Blue Jays’ only score.  Andy Pettitte  (10-9) gave up five hits in seven scoreless
innings for the Yankees. J.A. Happ (3-4), who surrendered five
runs on seven hits in 4 2/3 innings, hit Yankees second baseman
 Robinson Cano  on the left hand with a 90 mile-per-hour (145
kilometer-per-hour) fastball in the first inning. Cano, who left
the game after scoring on Soriano’s home run, is day to day as
his bruised hand heals.  The Yankees (70-62) are in fourth place in the American
League East, 7 1/2 games behind the division-leading Boston Red
Sox (78-55), who beat the third-place Baltimore Orioles (70-60)
13-2 last night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
