Wind-power installations in  Germany ,
the home of turbine makers  Siemens AG (SIE)  and  Nordex SE (NDX1) , rose 14
percent in the first half even as projects at sea were set back
by installation and connection delays, an industry lobby said.  Developers added 1,143 megawatts of turbines, including 105
megawatts offshore, up from 1,004 megawatts a year earlier, the
BWE group said today in an e-mailed statement.  Germany is investing in clean energy as it shutters nuclear
reactors. Its drive to raise the share of renewables to at least
35 percent of power use by 2020 from about 25 percent has driven
growth in wind farms even as some were postponed by glitches in
deep-water installation and an outmoded electrical grid.  Wind investments in Germany rose 23 percent last year to
about 2.7 billion euros ($3.6 billion), according to BWE, which
expects onshore additions of as much as 2,900 megawatts in 2013.  The renewables drive has helped push up energy costs in the
run-up to federal elections on Sept. 22. All the main political
parties have vowed to change the clean-energy subsidy program
after the vote, with  Chancellor Angela Merkel  saying in June
that the project boom had made “huge problems for the system.”  Investors are demanding greater political clarity over the
country’s subsidy plans, BWE said.  “Politics and bureaucracy still undermine a quick energy
switch,” said Sylvia Pilarsky-Grosch, the group’s president.  Global wind installations may reach 39,000 megawatts this
year and as much as 45,000 megawatts in 2014, according to
Thorsten Herdan, head of the manufacturers’ group VDMA Power
Systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
