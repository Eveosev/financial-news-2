The Australian dollar dropped to a
three-week low as global equity declines curbed demand for
higher-yielding assets amid prospects of military action against
 Syria .  The Aussie slid versus all of its 16 major counterparts and
touched a three-year low against the euro as the U.S.,  France 
and the U.K. signaled a possible armed response against Syria
after concluding the government used chemical weapons against
civilians. New Zealand’s currency touched a three-week low as
volatility headed for the highest closing level in more than a
month amid a selloff in emerging-market assets.  “The market is bracing for an escalation of Middle East
tensions and a possible strike against Syria,” said Ray Attrill, the global co-head of currency strategy at National
Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney. “There’s a bit of an emerging-market contagion flowing through the Aussie and the kiwi.”  The Australian dollar slid 0.9 percent to 89.08 U.S. cents
as of 4:50 p.m. in Sydney after touching 89.02 cents, the lowest
since Aug. 5, when it dropped to a three-year low. Benchmark 10-year yields fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 3.91 percent.  The Aussie touched A$1.5031 per euro, the weakest since May
2010, before trading 0.8 percent lower at A$1.5023.  New Zealand’s currency reached 77.48 U.S. cents, the
weakest since Aug. 5, before buying 77.60 cents, 0.5 percent
lower from yesterday’s close. The nation’s two-year swap rate, a
fixed payment made to receive floating rates, was little changed
at 3.39 percent from 3.38 percent yesterday, the lowest close
since Aug. 8.  Stocks Fall  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares fell 1.6 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index tumbled 1.6 percent yesterday.  U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  said yesterday that while
no decision has been made on a course of action against Syria,
it would be legal and proportionate. He summoned Parliament back
from a recess to debate the matter.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  plans to release this week an
intelligence assessment of the alleged Aug. 21 attack outside of
Damascus, and the administration has begun consultations with
U.S. congressional leaders.  Exchange data compiled by Bloomberg show overseas investors
have pulled $579.5 million from Indian stocks this month as of
Aug. 26, as the nation’s currency plunged to a record. They’ve
offloaded $464.2 million of Indonesian equities and sold $1.2
billion of Thai shares.  The Australian dollar has slumped 12 percent this year, the
worst performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. Its  New Zealand  peer has
fallen 2.4 percent.  Higher Volatility  Volatility on one-month Aussie options climbed for a third
day, rising 39 basis points to 13.56 percent, set for the
highest close since July 8. The equivalent figure for kiwi
dollar options rose jumped 36 basis points to 13.91 percent,
headed for the most since July 15.  There’s a 90 percent chance  Reserve Bank  of Australia
policy makers will keep benchmark borrowing costs at a record-low 2.5 percent when they next meet on Sept. 3,  interest-rate
swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show. Traders see a 61 percent

by their Dec. 3 gathering.  The South Pacific nation’s statistics bureau said today
