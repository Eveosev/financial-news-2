Corn dropped for a second day as
damage to plants from hot, dry weather in the U.S. Midwest may
be limited, as the crop is past the critical pollination
development stage. Wheat fell, while soybeans rose.  Little or no rain has fallen in parts of Iowa and  Illinois ,
the biggest U.S. producers of corn and soybeans, in the past two
weeks, National Weather Service data show. The dry weather
“favors any early-maturing crops” while stressing late-maturing crops including soybeans, forecaster DTN said in a
report today.  “It’s so late in the game that we’re not going to change
the yield in corn as much as we could on beans,” Frank J. Cholly, a senior commodities broker at RJO Futures in  Chicago ,
said in a telephone interview. “The weather in the next couple
of weeks is going to be critical for soybeans. The dry weather
may actually be more beneficial to corn than it is bad.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 1.1 percent to
settle at $4.8075 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The contract is down 20 percent this year as the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  projects domestic production at a
record 13.76 billion bushels. The U.S. is the world’s biggest
grower and exporter.  Wheat futures for December delivery dropped 0.6 percent to
$6.595 a bushel on the CBOT.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$13.7275 a bushel in Chicago. The price has rallied 18 percent
since reaching an 18-month low on Aug. 7.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, hay
and wheat, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
