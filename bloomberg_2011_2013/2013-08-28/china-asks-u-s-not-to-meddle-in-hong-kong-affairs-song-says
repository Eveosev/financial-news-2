China  is “firmly opposed” to
foreign powers meddling in Hong Kong’s affairs and the city’s
political reform is an internal issue, Commissioner Song Zhe of
China’s Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong told U.S. Consul-General
Clifford Hart in a meeting, according to a release on the
ministry’s website.  China hopes the U.S. envoy in Hong Kong won’t conduct
activities that are inappropriate for its status and won’t do
things that would hurt Hong Kong’s prosperity and affect China-U.S. relationship, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
