China , where one in four flights
departs late, is rerouting 36 flights around Beijing to ease
airspace congestion above the nation’s capital.  The scheduled trips will take different routes starting
today, the official Xinhua News Agency  reported  yesterday,
citing Wang Liya, head of the air control management bureau of
China’s civil aviation regulator. This will lead to shorter or
longer flying distance, with any increase limited to 10 percent,
Xinhua said. Two calls to Wang’s office went unanswered today.  China’s government is seeking to rein in delays at airlines
that are are worsening as carriers expand their fleets while the
nation’s military controls airspace and caps the allotment to
civil aviation at 20 percent.  Beijing and Shanghai had  on-time departure rates  of 18
percent and 29 percent respectively in July, the worst among 35
major international airports, according to Portland, Oregon-based FlightStats Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
