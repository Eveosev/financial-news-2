Opponents of a U.K. government plan
to construct a 33 billion-pound ($51 billion) high-speed rail
line through  England  will take their case to the  Supreme Court 
in October.  A group of local councils, residents and activists will
challenge the plan at a two-day hearing starting Oct. 15, the
Supreme Court said in an e-mail today. The opponents say the
rail line violates environmental law and the government failed
to take into consideration the concerns of people living near
the project.  HS2 trains could reach speeds as high as 225 miles (362
kilometers) per hour and would run between London and
Birmingham, with future spurs to Leeds and Manchester. The line
would run through the Chiltern hills, designated as an area of
outstanding natural beauty. Local governments, residents and a
golf club near the route oppose it as noisy and intrusive.  Two lower courts have already dismissed most of the claims
made by HS2 Action Alliance, a not-for-profit umbrella group
working against the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
