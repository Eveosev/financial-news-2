NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the Syrian government appears to have been behind
last week’s massacre of civilians with chemical arms near
Damascus and urged an international response.  “Information available from a wide variety of sources
points to the Syrian regime as responsible for the use of
chemical weapons in these attacks,” Rasmussen said in an e-mailed statement after representatives of the 28 allied
governments met in Brussels today. “Any use of such weapons is
unacceptable and cannot go unanswered. Those responsible must be
held accountable.”  Rasmussen gave no indication of a role for the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in any attack on Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad’s forces. NATO’s only current regional
involvement lies in protecting the southeastern border of
 Turkey , an alliance member, with batteries of Patriot missiles.  The U.S., Britain and France -- all NATO members -- are in
the vanguard of preparing a military strike on  Syria , while some
allied countries won’t make up their minds until the United
Nations assesses whether chemical weapons were used last week.  “NATO allies expressed their full support to the ongoing
UN investigation,” according to the statement. “They deplored
that the Syrian regime failed to provide immediate and secure
access for the United Nations inspectors to the sites of the
attacks.”  Opposition groups say more than 1,300 people were killed in
last week’s attacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
