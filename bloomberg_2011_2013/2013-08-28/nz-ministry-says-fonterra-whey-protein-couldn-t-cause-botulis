Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the
world’s largest dairy exporter, didn’t produce whey protein with
a bacterial contamination that could have caused botulism,
according to  New Zealand ’s government.  “The bacteria found in whey protein concentrate
manufactured by Fonterra is not clostridium botulinum,” Scott
Gallacher, acting director general of the Ministry of Primary
Industries, said today on a conference call. “It is therefore
not capable of producing botulism-causing toxins.”  China , Fonterra’s largest milk powder customer, banned some
products this month after discovery of batches of whey protein
with a contamination that could cause botulism. The ministry
said in a statement at it undertook tests, using local and
overseas laboratories, on the whey protein after Fonterra
advised it Aug. 2 that there was a potential contamination of a
38 metric ton batch made at a North Island plant.  The organism identified in the whey protein was clostridium
sporogenes, which doesn’t lead to any known food safety issue,
Gallacher said. Certain strains may be associated with food
spoilage, he said.  Fonterra earlier called on the ministry to release the test
results citing speculation on the negative result. Trading in
Fonterra Shareholder’s Fund units was halted on the stock
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
