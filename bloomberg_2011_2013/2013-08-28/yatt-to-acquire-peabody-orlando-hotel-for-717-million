Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H) , the chain
controlled by the Pritzker family, agreed to purchase the
Peabody Orlando Hotel for $717 million to accommodate convention
travelers in the Florida tourist destination.  The sale of the 1,641-room hotel, attached to to the Orange
County Convention Center, is expected to be completed in
October, Hyatt said today in a statement. The property will be
renamed the Hyatt Regency Orlando Convention Center.  “This transaction brings us a very high-quality hotel in
one of the most popular cities in the world and enhances the
Hyatt Regency brand,” Stephen Haggerty, global head of real
estate for Chicago-based Hyatt, said in a statement.  The hotel will be the company’s sixth in Orlando and the
first one associated with conventions. The property has more
than 200,000 square feet (18,600 square meters) of group
facilities, along with more than 2 million square feet at the
Orange County Convention Center, which will give it the most
meeting space of any of its U.S. Hyatt Regency properties.  The seller is an affiliate of Memphis, Tennessee-based
investment firm Belz Enterprises and Orlando-based Estein &
Associates USA Ltd.  The hotel recently had a $440 million renovation and Hyatt
said it doesn’t plan to invest “significant capital” in the
near future.  Hyatt expects the property to generate about $10 million in
fourth-quarter  earnings  before in interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization. That will rise to about $55 million for 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
