Kenya  is considering raising more
than $1 billion in its planned debut Eurobond sale that will
take place by the end of this year, Treasury Principal Secretary
Kamau Thugge said.  The government plans to use part of the proceeds to help
repay a $600 million syndicated loan that falls due in May,
Thugge said in an interview today in the capital, Nairobi. The
funds will also be used for infrastructure projects in the
country, he said.  “We are considering raising more than $1 billion because
we intend to use part of the money to offset the syndicated
loan,” he said. “We are still in the process of recruiting
lead managers for the transaction. We want the disbursements
definitely before the end of the year.”  Kenya,  East Africa ’s biggest economy, is planning its first
sovereign debt sale to help plug a fiscal deficit and finance
construction of railway and power-generation projects. The
offering follows similar plans by other African nations
including Senegal and  Ghana . Rwanda in April became the first
East African country to sell a Eurobond, raising $400 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
