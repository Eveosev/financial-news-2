China Grand Automotive Services Co. (CGAGPZ) ,
the Chinese car dealer backed by TPG Capital, plans to seek at
least $500 million in an initial public offering in  Hong Kong ,
said two people with knowledge of the matter.  China Grand Auto, based in Shanghai, may start the share
sale early next year, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. China
International Capital Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are
working on the offering, the people said.  The IPO would be Hong Kong’s biggest for a car dealership
since at least December 2010, when  China ZhengTong Auto Services
Holdings Ltd. (1728)  raised $514 million, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. China ZhengTong has fallen 39 percent from its IPO price.  Company officials weren’t available to respond to a phone
inquiry at China Grand Auto’s head office in Shanghai. China
Grand Auto had planned to seek about $1 billion in a Hong Kong
IPO, people with knowledge of the matter said in April 2010.  China Grand Auto posted a profit of 1.5 billion  yuan  ($245
million) on sales of 73 billion yuan last year, according to the
company’s website. It aims to overtake  AutoNation Inc. (AN)  as the
world’s biggest car dealer this year, China Grand Auto says on
its website.  AutoNation had sales of $15.7 billion in 2012, equivalent
to 96 billion yuan at today’s exchange rate, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The company trades at 16.5 times trailing 12-month earnings, according to the data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
