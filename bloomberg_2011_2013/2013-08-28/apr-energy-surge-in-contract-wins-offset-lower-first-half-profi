APR Energy Plc (APR) , a U.K. supplier of
temporary power generators, won a 72 percent increase in new
contracts in the first half of the year, easing the pain of
lower revenue and profit.  The company signed 593MW of new deals in the six months
through June, more than in the whole of 2012, with an additional
111MW in extensions, London-based APR said in a statement today.
The wins included a 200MW addition to a contract in Libya,
bringing total generation capacity in the North African country
to 450MW. Uruguay became the company’s second-largest market
after two 100MW sites went into operation.  “This was a transformative period for the company,” Chief
Executive Officer John Campion said in a phone interview today.
“ Libya  and Uruguay came online. We put 450MW into Libya in
approximately 90 days. 450MW would be bigger than Battersea
power station was at a time.”  APR first-half revenue fell 44 percent to $87.2 million
after the end of a Japanese contract that accounted for 40
percent of 2012 sales, the company said. Operating profit was
more than ten times lower at $400,000. Full-year sales will
probably be $321 million, according to the median estimate of
nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “While the headline interim results do not look very
pretty, the results in the second half should be materially
better and we are not likely to change our full-year underlying
forecasts,” John Lawson, an analyst at Investec, wrote in a
note to clients. Lawson has a hold recommendation on the stock
with a target price of 900 pence, which is under review.  Infrastructure Projects  APR  shares  advanced as much as 6.1 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since July 4, and traded 5.4 percent higher at
1023 pence at 11:30 a.m. in  London . The stock has gained 26
percent this year, valuing the company at 799 million pounds
($1.2 billion).  APR announced 147MW in new contracts today for power
projects in Mozambique, Indonesia and  Senegal . The company is
focused on  emerging markets  that need electricity to support
long-term infrastructure projects, Campion said. The financial
impact of these awards is not expected to be felt until 2014,
the company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
