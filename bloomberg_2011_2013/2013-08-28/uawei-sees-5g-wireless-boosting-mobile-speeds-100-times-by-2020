Huawei Technologies Co.,  China ’s
largest phone-network equipment maker, said it plans to
introduce fifth-generation mobile technology for commercial
service by 2020, with speeds 100 times current 4G networks.  Even before 4G service is commercially available in China,
Huawei has devoted hundreds of engineers to develop the
technology, Ken Hu, the Shenzhen-based company’s deputy chairman
and rotating chief executive officer, said in an e-mail today.  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the world’s largest wireless carrier, is
conducting trials of 4G networks in China with licenses for
commercial service anticipated by the end of the year, the
company said in March. There are about 200 4G networks operating
commercially in 75 countries today, with another 200 in progress
or planned, Hu said, citing the Global Mobile Suppliers
Association. About half the world’s population will have access
to 4G mobile networks by 2018, he said.  Adoption of 5G, which requires appropriate airwaves be
released by government regulators, will mean mobile broadband at
speeds of up to 10 gigabytes, or 100 times the fastest 4G
connection, Hu said. Current 4G mobile technology offers
Internet connections at speeds up to 100 megabytes, three times
faster than the 3G technology that preceded it.  China is looking to jointly develop 5G technology with
companies in  Taiwan  and set up a cross-strait supply chain, the
Taipei-based Commercial Times reported today, citing China’s
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Deputy Minister
Liu Lihua. Liu invited Taiwan-based companies including  Hon Hai
Precision Industry Co. (2317)  and  MediaTek Inc. (2454)  to join China’s 5G
development team, the report said, without saying where it got
the information.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
