Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister
 John Baird  said a “firm international response” is needed
against Syria as the U.S. and its NATO allies prepare evidence
the Assad government used chemical weapons on its own people.  Baird, speaking today to reporters in Montreal, said Canada
will wait to see what options are chosen before it determines
what assistance it can provide.  “We understand that as this struggle drags on, Canada will
need to do more, and we are willing to do so,” Baird said.
“The Syrian regime has charted a dangerous path. The
appropriate consequences will follow.”  The U.S. and the U.K. today said they are prepared to take
military action against Syria without authorization from the
 United Nations Security Council .  To contact the reporter on this story:
