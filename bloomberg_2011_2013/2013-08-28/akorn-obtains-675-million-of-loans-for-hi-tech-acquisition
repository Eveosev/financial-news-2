Akorn Inc. (AKRX) , a maker of generic eye-care products, obtained $675 million of financing commitments
backing its purchase of Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co.  The credit pact consists of a $600 million term loan and a
$75 million revolving credit line, according to a regulatory
filing today. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is providing the debt
commitments.  Akorn agreed to buy Hi-Tech Pharmacal for $640 million in
cash to expand into areas including cold and cough treatments.
The company expects the deal will be completed in the first
quarter of 2014.  The seven-year term loan will help fund the merger, while
the five-year revolver will be used by Lake Forest, Illinois-based Akorn for general corporate purposes, according to the
regulatory filing.  Under a revolver, money can be borrowed again once it’s
repaid; in a  term loan , it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
