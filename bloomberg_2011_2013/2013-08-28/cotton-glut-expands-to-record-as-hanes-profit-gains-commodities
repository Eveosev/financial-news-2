The fourth straight year of  surplus 
cotton output and the biggest drop in Chinese imports since 2000
are creating record global inventories, signaling higher profits
for the makers of Hanes underwear.  Stockpiles will jump 8.6 percent to 93.765 million bales in
the 12 months ending in July, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said in an Aug. 12 report. There are enough inventories to make
three pairs of  jeans  for every person in the world and reserves
doubled since reaching a 13-year low in 2010. Prices may fall 8
percent to 76.6 cents a pound by the end of 2013, according to
the average of 16 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  China , which uses about a third of the world’s cotton, will
reduce imports by 46 percent, or 9.33 million bales, from last
year as it focuses on supporting local producers. It is
accumulating the biggest  stockpiles  ever after the government
bought supply to aid farmers as economic growth slowed. The
USDA’s prediction for Chinese imports is about twice the drop it
expects in global output, at a time when crops are improving
across the U.S.,  India ,  Brazil  and  Australia .  “We expect weak Chinese demand and high global production
to continue weighing on prices,” said Paul Christopher, the St.
Louis-based chief international strategist at Wells Fargo
Advisors, which oversees about $1.3 trillion of assets. “The
Chinese economy is slowing and export growth has been weaker
than we expected for textile mills and other manufacturers.”  Demand Expands  Cotton rose 11 percent this year to close today at 83.24
cents on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Prices are down from a
five-month high in March as improving field conditions reduced
concern that drought would damage the U.S. crop. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities advanced 2.6 percent
since the end of December, and the MSCI All-Country World Index
of equities added 7.6 percent. The Bloomberg Treasury Bond Index
lost 3.3 percent.  Global production will drop 3.9 percent to 116.38 million
bales in the 12 months that began Aug. 1 as demand expands 2.3
percent to 109.85 million bales, the USDA says. A bale weighs
480 pounds (218 kilograms). China’s stockpiles will surge 16
percent to 58.26 million bales, more than five times what it
held in 2011 and 62 percent of estimated world inventory.  The glut emerged after prices almost doubled in 2010 and
reached an all-time high of $2.197 in March 2011. Production
expanded to a record 125.14 million bales the following year.
Demand fell 11 percent since peaking in 2007 as the global
recession curbed sales of clothing, bedding and textiles.  Lower Costs  “The market cannot ignore the fact that huge stocks
exist,” said Jordan Lea, the chairman of Eastern Trading Co.,
an exporter in Greenville,  South Carolina . The inventories
“will come to the market at some time, at some price,” he
said. “That is how they will threaten a rally.”  Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI) , the Winston Salem, North Carolina-based
maker of Hanes underwear and Playtex bras, said July 30 that its
cotton costs dropped 49 percent in the second quarter. The
company raised its full-year earnings-per-share  forecast  to
$3.50 to $3.65, from $3.25 to $3.40.  Net income at Levi Strauss & Co., the San Francisco-based
maker of Levi’s jeans and Dockers apparel, more than tripled to
$48 million in the second quarter, “mainly due to lower cotton
costs,” along with higher sales and more-profitable products,
Chief Financial Officer Harmit J. Singh said on a July 9
conference call.  China Buying  The predicted drop in prices may be curbed by China, where
the government plans to buy from farmers for a third year. The
program runs from September through March 2014 and pays 20,400
 yuan  ($3,332) a metric ton, the China Cotton Association said in
April. That’s about $1.51 a pound, or 80 percent more than New
York futures. While the government may halt purchases in favor
of direct subsidies to farmers, that won’t occur until at least
the middle of next year, Robert Yang, assistant president of the
China National Textile & Apparel Council, said June 28.  China’s  imports , which accounted for 43 percent of global
purchases last year, fell 21 percent in the first seven months
to 2.74 million tons, from 3.46 million a year earlier, customs
data show.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators more than doubled
their net-long position, or bets on higher prices, since early
June and are the most bullish since the U.S. government began
tracking the data in 2006. Long positions outnumbered shorts by
82,715 futures and options contracts as of Aug. 20, U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. A contract
represents 50,000 pounds.  Texas Drought  The outlook for the U.S. harvest has worsened. On Aug. 12,
the government said that production will drop 25 percent to a
four-year low of 13.05 million bales. In May, it forecast 14
million. Drought in  Texas , the biggest grower, will reduce the
state’s crop by 18 percent to 4.12 million bales, the USDA says.  Heavy showers returned to parts of the Southeast in the
week ended Aug. 25 and some of the wettest areas received more
than 4 inches (10.2 centimeters), hampering fieldwork and
hurting crops, according to the USDA. While the region is dry
now, rain will return Sept. 2 to Sept. 6, according to Commodity
Weather Group LLC. About 47 percent of the U.S. crop was in good
or excellent condition by Aug. 25, from 46 percent a week
earlier, the government says.  In India, the second-largest exporter, rainfall has boosted
the outlook for the domestic crop, which the Cotton Association
of India estimated Aug. 20 would reach 37.2 million bales, or
3.6 percent more than the USDA forecast this month. A bale in
India weighs 170 kilograms.  Selling Reserves  While China is buying from farmers, it is unloading
government-owned inventories that the  International Cotton
Advisory Committee  estimated at 7.8 million tons as of July 31,
or almost as much as the nation consumes in a year. The state
sold 2 million tons from reserves this year through June 6,
according to the China National Cotton Reserves Corp. That’s
reducing the need for mills to import from foreign suppliers.  Australia, the third-largest exporter, may reap as much as
5.5 million bales this year, more than the 4.5 million forecast
by the USDA, Rabobank International said Aug. 8. Production also
will rise in Pakistan and Brazil, the biggest producers behind
China, India and the U.S., according to Cotlook Ltd., the
publisher of a benchmark cotton index.  “The world has too much cotton and not enough demand,”
said  John Flanagan , the president of Flanagan Trading in Fuquay-Varina,  North Carolina . “Only lower prices can shut acres
enough so that we can start seeing a multi year reduction in
inventories, which are huge.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
