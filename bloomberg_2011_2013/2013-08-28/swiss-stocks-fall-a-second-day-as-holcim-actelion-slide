Stocks in Switzerland  retreated,
after the  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  yesterday dropped the most in two
months, as concern grew that the U.S. will take military action
against  Syria  for using chemical weapons on its own people.  Holcim Ltd., the world’s biggest cement maker, slipped 1.5
percent. Actelion Ltd. lost 1.2 percent.  The SMI declined 0.3 percent to 7,860.4 at 9:26 a.m. in
Zurich. The equity benchmark rose 0.6 percent last week as
measures of manufacturing in the euro area and China increased
more than economists had forecast. The SMI has still  advanced 15
percent  so far this year. The broader Swiss Performance Index
also slid 0.3 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 44 percent greater than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The U.S.,  France  and Britain have moved closer to
retaliatory military action against Syria, laying out the
justification, putting forces into place and rounding up allies
in the region.  The countries will focus any armed response on Syria’s
weapons capabilities and wouldn’t direct it at deposing
President Bashar al-Assad, U.S. and U.K. officials said. U.K.
Prime Minister David Cameron said in  London  that any course of
action will be legal and proportionate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
