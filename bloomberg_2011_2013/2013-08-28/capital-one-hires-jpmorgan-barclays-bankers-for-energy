Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the
lender that gets more than half its revenue from credit cards,
hired two bankers with experience advising firms in the oil and
gas industries as it expands its securities business.  Former  Barclays Plc (BARC)  banker Russ Johnson and Bob
Mertensotto, who worked for  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , will fill
newly created positions, according to a statement today from the
McLean, Virginia-based company. Johnson, who co-led oil and gas
leveraged finance at Barclays, will be head of energy investment
banking, while Mertensotto will lead energy debt-capital
markets, according to the statement.  Johnson and Mertensotto will be in charge of Capital Oneâ€™s
energy-banking office in Houston and report to Jim McBride, head
of the energy-banking group within capital markets, the company
said. Mertensotto began at the bank today, while Johnson joined
last week, Michael Bulger, a Capital One spokesman, said in an
e-mail.  The hires are the second and third this month announced by
Capital One in its securities group as it looks to increase
revenue outside of consumer credit-card lending in the U.S. On
Aug. 14, the firm announced the hiring of former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. banker Steven Tulip to head the capital-markets
business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
