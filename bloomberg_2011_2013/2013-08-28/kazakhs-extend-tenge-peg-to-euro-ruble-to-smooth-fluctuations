Kazakhstan ’s central bank will
expand the currencies it targets to include the euro and the
ruble as it seeks to smooth exchange-rate fluctuations.  The new peg, which will come into effect from Sept. 2, will
reduce the “speculative sentiment on the market and subdue the
negative impact of speculative flows,” the Almaty-based
regulator said in a statement sent by e-mail today. The changes
will reduce the role of the dollar in the local  currency market 
and in trade, it said.  The currency basket will be made up of 70 percent dollars,
20 percent euros and 10 percent rubles, the central bank said.  There are no grounds to devalue the Kazakh tenge, which has
weakened 1.1 percent since May 22 amid concern the U.S. will
pare back stimulus, the central bank said July 25. The bank
devalued the tenge by 21 percent in February 2009.  Kazakh central bank Chairman Grigori Marchenko has urged
Kazakhstan’s customs union partners Russia and Belarus to align
their currency policies to avoid “sharp, unilateral”
devaluations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
