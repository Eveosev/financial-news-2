The dollar rose to the highest level
in four weeks as reports showed U.S. economic growth accelerated
and jobless claims declined, backing the case for the  Federal
Reserve  to reduce stimulus as soon as next month.  The U.S. currency advanced for a second day versus the yen
as benchmark Treasury yields climbed toward a two-year high,
bolstering the attraction of the dollar.  India ’s rupee jumped
more than 3 percent after the central bank said it will sell
dollars to the nation’s biggest oil importers to cool demand for
foreign exchange. The euro fell against the majority of its 16
most-traded counterparts.  “The Fed could taper as early as next month -- jobless
claims continue to show gradual improvements,” Eric Viloria,
senior currency strategist for Gain Capital Group LLC in New
York, said in a telephone interview. “The dollar is stronger
than all of the Group of 10 currencies because of easing of
concerns on Syria.”  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.5 percent to
1,033.48 at 5 p.m.  New York  time after touching 1,034.03, the
highest since Aug. 2.  The U.S. currency advanced 0.7 percent to 98.35 yen after
gaining 0.6 percent yesterday. The greenback strengthened 0.7
percent to $1.3241 per euro after adding 0.9 percent, the
biggest one-day gain on an intraday basis since July 4. The yen
gained was little changed at 130.22 per euro.  Lira, Shekel  Britain’s pound gained 2 percent against the greenback this
month, the best performance among the major currencies, while
the African rand had the biggest loss, at 4.7 percent. The euro
and yen each lost 0.5 percent.  The Turkish lira and Israeli shekel reversed declines as
expectation of an imminent military strike on  Syria  receded as
the U.K. and  France  said they favor waiting for the results of a
United Nations investigation into alleged use of chemical
weapons.  “Threat of military action in Syria led to a classic risk-off move,” ABN Amro Group NV strategists Georgette Boele and
Peter de Bruin in Amsterdam wrote today in a note to clients.
“But it already seems to be losing steam, and is likely to
prove short-lived.”  The lira gained 0.1 percent to 2.0358 per dollar after
depreciating to 2.0730 yesterday, a record according to data
compiled by Bloomberg since 1981. The shekel rallied 0.8 percent
to 3.6234 a dollar.  Rupee Rebound  The rupee halted a three-day slide after the  Reserve Bank 
of India said it will provide foreign currency to state-run
Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum
Corp., which the central bank will later repurchase.  India’s currency surged 3.3 percent to close at 66.595 per
dollar in Mumbai. It has still tumbled 16 percent in the past
three months and slid to a record 68.845 yesterday.  The dollar extended gains as as gross domestic product rose
at a 2.5 percent annualized rate, up from an initial estimate of
1.7 percent, Commerce Department figures showed. The median
forecast of 79 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected a 2.2
percent gain.  Jobless claims  in the week ended Aug. 24 dropped 6,000 to
331,000 from a revised 337,000 the week before, the Labor
Department said. Another survey called for a drop to 332,000.  September Tapering  Fed policy makers are debating whether the  U.S. economy  is
strong enough to allow them to pare back monthly purchases of
$85 billion in Treasuries and mortgage debt. Officials will
reduce the amount at their next meeting on Sept. 17-18,
according to 65 percent of economists in an Aug. 9-13 Bloomberg
survey.  The dollar gained against the majority of its most-traded
peers as the Treasury  10-year yield  rose as high as 2.83 percent
after climbing to 2.93 percent on Aug. 22, the highest since
July 2011.  “The fact that U.S. yields are squeezing up again is
reasonably significant and we are coming back to the assumption
that the data is a little more relevant,” said  Jeremy Stretch ,
head of currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
in  London . “That’s providing some impetus for the dollar.”  The greenback has advanced 5.7 percent this year, the best
performer after the euro of 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The common
currency rose 6.1 percent, while the yen tumbled 8 percent.  Options Trading  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $15 billion, from $24 billion yesterday, according to
data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust Clearing
Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on the euro-dollar  exchange rate  amounted to $2.2 billion, the largest share
of trades at 15 percent. Options on the dollar-yen rate totaled
$2.1 billion, or 15 percent.  Euro-dollar options trading was 3.2 percent less than the
average for the past five Thursdays at a similar time in the
day, and greenback-yen trading was 66 percent less, according to
Bloomberg analysis.  Australian dollar-yen options trading, at $302 million, was
68 percent above average. The Aussie gained for a second day,
rising 0.6 percent to 87.83 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
