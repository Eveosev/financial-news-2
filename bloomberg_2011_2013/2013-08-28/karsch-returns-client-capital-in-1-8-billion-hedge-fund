Michael Karsch is returning client
money in his $1.8 billion hedge-fund firm after 13 years, saying
he wants to take time to contemplate the next stage of his
career, according to a letter sent to investors.  Karsch, 45, plans to return 95 percent of client assets in
New York-based Karsch Capital Management LP by Sept. 30 and the
remainder no later than January, according to the letter, a copy
of which was seen by  Bloomberg News .  “I feel as I approach twenty years as an investment
manager, it is time for me to take a step back, reflect on my
experiences and begin to think about the next chapter of my
career,” Karsch wrote in the letter, dated today.  Karsch founded his firm in 2000, after stints as a managing
director at Soros Fund Management LLC and an investment role at
Chieftain Capital Management Inc. Karsch Capital, which manages
about $1.3 billion in stock  hedge funds , has outperformed the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index by 100 percentage points with its
main fund, according to the letter.  Shawn Pattison, a spokesman for Karsch at Abernathy
MacGregor, declined to comment beyond the contents of the
letter.  Karsch Capital’s main fund returned 6.1 percent this year
through Aug. 23. A long-only fund, which manages about $500
million, returned 16 percent. Since its inception in 2006, that
fund has returned 94 percent, compared with 55 percent for the
 S&P 500 (SPX) , according to the letter.  Karsch started his career as an investment banking analyst
at Wasserstein Perella & Co. He graduated from  Tufts University 
in 1990 and has a masters from its Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy as well as an MBA from  Harvard Business School .  To contact the reporter on this story:
