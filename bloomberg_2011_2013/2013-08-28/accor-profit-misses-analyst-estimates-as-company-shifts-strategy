Accor SA (AC) ,  Europe â€™s largest hotel
operator, said first-half profit fell 6.6 percent as the company
began a three-year change of strategy that includes property
sales and cost cutting.  Earnings before interest and taxes slid to 198 million
euros ($265 million) from 212 million euros a year earlier, the
Paris-based company said today in a statement. Analysts expected
profit of 212 million euros, according to the average of 10
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Accor said it expects full-year
profit to be between 510 million euros and 530 million euros,
compared with 526 million euros in 2012.  Accor is in the first year of a three-year reorganization
that includes increasing its focus on  emerging markets , reducing
debt, selling some properties and cutting costs. It plans to
reduce its share of leased or owned properties to 20 percent by
2016, from the current 58 percent, with the rest operated under
franchise or management contracts.  Yesterday, the company said Sebastien Bazin, head of
European investing at Accor shareholder Colony Capital LLC, will
take over as chairman and chief executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
