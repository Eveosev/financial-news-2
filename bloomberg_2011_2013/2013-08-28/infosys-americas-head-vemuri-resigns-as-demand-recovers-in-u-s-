Infosys Ltd.,  India ’s second-largest
software services exporter, said Ashok Vemuri has resigned from
the company, the board and as head of Americas and global
manufacturing services.  Sanjay Jalona, currently overseeing manufacturing in North
America, will take the role of global head of manufacturing, the
Bangalore-based company said in a stock exchange filing today.
No replacement was named for the U.S. operations.  Vemuri’s departure after a 15-year stint comes amid signs
of a recovery in information technology services demand in the
U.S., the company’s  largest market . Strong bookings data from
International Business Machines Corp. and comments from offshore
companies point to increased spending in consulting and
discretionary work in the second half, according to Anurag Rana,
an analyst at Bloomberg Industries.  “It’s a big loss for the company,” Hardik Shah, an
analyst with KR Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt. in Mumbai, said
by phone referring to Vemuri’s resignation. “He had been with
them for 15 years, such a person can’t be easily replaced.”  Two calls to a number listed for Vemuri in New Jersey
weren’t answered.  Infosys (INFO)  rose 2 percent to 3,116.25 rupees at the close in
Mumbai trading, before the company’s announcement. The stock has
surged 34 percent this year, making it the third-best  performer 
on the 30-company S&P BSE Sensex Index. The benchmark has
declined 7.4 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
