Hog futures declined for the first
time in four sessions on concern that a plunge in the cost of
livestock feed will spur an increase in U.S. pork supplies.
Cattle prices gained.  Corn futures fell for the second day in  Chicago  and are
down 39 percent in the past year on signs U.S. farmers will
harvest a record crop this year. Cheaper grain can increase pork
production as farmers boost feed rations. Wholesale  pork  fell
0.2 percent to 99 cents a pound yesterday, the lowest in almost
five weeks, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  “We have very adequate hogs around,” Lawrence Kane, a
senior market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group, said in a
telephone interview from Yates City,  Illinois . “Hog numbers
have remained fairly stable.”  Hog futures for October settlement fell 0.3 percent to
86.275 cents a pound at 9:57 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices rose 2.6 percent in the previous three
sessions.  Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$1.27225 a pound on the CME. Prices were down 4.2 percent this
year through yesterday. Feeder-cattle futures for October
settlement advanced 0.6 percent to $1.5795 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
