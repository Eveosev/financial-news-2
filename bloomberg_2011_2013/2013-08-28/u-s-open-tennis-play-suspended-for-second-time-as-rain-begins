U.S. Open play was suspended after
resuming for 14 minutes as rain began to fall at the National
Tennis Center in New York.  The tournament was held up for almost two hours earlier
today before it restarted. So far, weather has forced
suspensions on two of the three days of the event.  To contact the reporter on this story:
