Hong Kong   stocks  dropped, with the
benchmark index falling a second day, amid mounting concern a
possible military strike on  Syria  may disrupt the flow of oil.
PetroChina Co. and Kunlun Energy Co. slumped after executives
resigned amid an anti-corruption crackdown in  China .  The  Hang Seng Index  slid 1.4 percent to 21,569.73 as of
9:31 a.m. in Hong Kong, the biggest decline since Aug. 20. All
but two shares fell on the 50-member gauge. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index lost 1.7 percent to 9,820.66. Shares dropped
last week on expectations the U.S. will curb stimulus as soon as
next month.  “Growing geopolitical risks in the Middle East and
lingering uncertainty about U.S. monetary policy have combined
into the perfect storm,” Matthew Sherwood, Sydney-based head of
markets research at Perpetual Investments, which manages about
$25 billion, said in an e-mail. “At the moment liquidity is
light and markets are likely to keep heading lower.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  retreated 3.5 percent this year through
yesterday, the second-worst performer among developed markets
tracked by Bloomberg. The gauge yesterday traded at 10.47 times
estimated earnings, compared with 14.8 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 13.66 on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the  S&P 500  rose 0.3 percent today. The gauge
lost 1.6 percent in New York yesterday, the biggest drop in nine
weeks, as the U.S., France and Britain laid legal groundwork for
a military strike on Syria after its government allegedly turned
chemical weapons on its people. The tension outweighed data
showing  consumer confidence  unexpectedly climbed.  Crude Surges  West Texas Intermediate crude rose, extending yesterday’s
2.9 percent advance to the highest close since Feb. 24, 2012.
Libya’s National Oil Corp. said output may have dropped below
200,000 barrels a day, the lowest since the 2011 uprising that
toppled Muammar Qaddafi.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the  H-share index , dropped 18 percent through yesterday from a Feb. 1
high on concern over  China’s economy  after a two-quarter
slowdown in growth. The measure traded at 1.2 times book value,
compared with a five-year average of 1.77.  China widened its anti-corruption crackdown to include the
nation’s biggest company by market value, as PetroChina said
three senior managers resigned and were under investigation by
authorities.  Growing speculation the  Federal Reserve  will taper bond
buying has weighed on equities in recent weeks. The central bank
is expected to pare asset purchases in September by $10 billion
to a $75 billion monthly pace, according to economists surveyed
by Bloomberg on Aug. 9-13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
