Germany’s 10-year government bonds
rose for a third day as a report showed a gauge of  consumer
confidence  in  Europe ’s largest economy will decline for the
first time in eight months in September.  Benchmark  10-year yields  approached a two-week low after
market-research company  GfK SE (GFK)  said its consumer-sentiment
 index , based on a survey of about 2,000 people, will drop to 6.9
from 7 in August. Economists forecast a gain to 7.1, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Italy is
scheduled to sell 8.5 billion euros ($11.4 billion) of six-month
bills as Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s government meets to
approve the reduction of a real-estate tax.  Germany’s 10-year bund yield dropped two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.83 percent as of 7:19 a.m. London
time. The rate fell to 1.80 percent on Aug. 15. The 1.5 percent
security due in May 2023 rose 0.16, or 1.60 euros per 1,000-euro
face amount, to 97.10.  Italy last sold 184-day bills on July 29 at an average
yield of 0.799 percent, compared with a rate of 0.599 percent at
a previous auction on July 10.  German bonds lost 2.1 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italian securities
returned 3.3 percent, while Spain’s earned 7.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
