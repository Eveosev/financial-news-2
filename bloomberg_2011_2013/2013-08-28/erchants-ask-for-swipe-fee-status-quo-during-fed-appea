The  U.S. Federal Reserve ’s rules for
debit-card transaction fees and processing should remain in
place while the central bank appeals a decision throwing out the
regulations, according to retailers who oppose the new
directives.  Retailers “vastly prefer the status quo” to the
“unregulated ‘free for all’ which would likely subject
merchants to interchange fees well in excess of the Fed’s
currents standard,” lawyers for retail interests wrote in
papers filed today in federal court in  Washington .  The merchants’ filing was in support of the Fed’s Aug. 26
request that the rules be left in place pending the central
bank’s appeal.  The Fed is seeking to reverse U.S. District Judge Richard Leon’s ruling that it wrongly set the cap on debit-card
transaction fees, known as swipe fees, at about 21 cents for
each transaction, and neglected to bolster competition among
payment networks.  If the Fed loses the appeal, it should be required to issue
new rules within four months, retailers said in today’s filing.  The case is NACS v. Board of Governors of the  Federal
Reserve System , 11-cv-02075, U.S. District Court,  District of
Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
