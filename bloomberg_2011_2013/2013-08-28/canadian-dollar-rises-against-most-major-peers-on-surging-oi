The Canadian currency weakened as
speculation America and its allies will take military action
against Syria boosted the  U.S. dollar ’s appeal as a haven.  Canada ’s dollar rallied earlier versus most major peers as
 crude oil , the country’s largest export, touched its highest
level in more than two years amid bets military operations may
disrupt Middle East oil supplies. The loonie, as the currency is
called, declined against the greenback before data this week
forecast to show the  U.S. economy  expanded in the second quarter
while Canada’s contracted in June.  “There is a general bid tone in the market for the U.S.
dollar on the back of the  Syria crisis ,” said David Bradley,
director of foreign-exchange trading at  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ’s
Scotia Capital unit in Toronto. “It is also creating an
environment for higher gold and higher crude, which is Canadian-dollar positive. Dollar-Canada is trading within recent
ranges.”  The loonie, nicknamed for the image of the aquatic bird on
the C$1 coin, depreciated as much as 0.4 percent, the most
compared with closing prices since Aug. 22, to C$1.0511 per U.S.
dollar before trading at C$1.0487 at 5 p.m. in Toronto, down 0.1
percent. One Canadian dollar buys 95.36 U.S. cents.  Canadian  government bonds  fell for the first time in five
days, pushing the  yield  on the benchmark 10-year security up
from a two-week low of 2.56 percent reached yesterday. The yield
increased six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 2.62
percent. The price of the 1.5 percent debt due in June 2023
dropped 48 cents to C$90.42.  Bond Auction  The Bank of Canada auctioned C$3.4 billion ($3.2 billion)
of five-year bonds at an average yield of 1.957 percent. The
1.25 percent securities due in September 2018 drew C$8.9 billion
in bids, for a bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand, of 2.62.  At the last five-year bond auction, on July 10, the central
bank sold C$3.4 billion of the securities at an average yield of
1.884 percent and a coverage ratio of 2.52.  The Canadian dollar gained 0.2 percent over the past week
against nine other developed-nation currencies tracked by the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Index. Australia’s dollar lost
0.9 percent, and the  New Zealand dollar  dropped 0.5 percent. The
U.S. currency was little changed.  Implied volatility for three-month options on Canada’s
dollar versus its U.S. counterpart slipped to 7.75 percent after
touching 7.97 percent yesterday, the highest intraday level
since July 17. The measure is used to set option prices and
gauge the expected pace of currency swings. The average for this
year is 6.8 percent.  Crude Oil  Futures for West Texas Intermediate crude climbed as much
as 3 percent to $112.24 a barrel in New York, the highest level
since May 2011, before trading at $109.52, up 0.5 percent.  Brent
crude  rallied as much as 2.6 percent to $117.34 a barrel.  A U.S.-led strike on Syria in retaliation for the alleged
use of chemical weapons in its civil war is probable within the
next week, raising the possibility Brent may hit $150 should a
widening conflict halt oil output in Iraq or other producers,
according to Societe Generale SA.  “There is a chain of impact that would cause crude-oil
prices to rise, and an adjunct impact of that would be some
strength in the Canadian dollar,” said  Jack Spitz , managing
director of foreign exchange at  National Bank of Canada (NA) , by
phone from Toronto. “I see the geopolitics as having a
temporary impact on financial markets, from having a flight-to-quality perspective, risk-aversion metrics, and of course
commodity-price rises.”  Standard & Poor’s  GSCI Index (SPGSCI)  of 24 raw materials increased
0.9 percent. Gold for immediate delivery jumped as much as 1.3
percent to $1,433.73 an ounce before trading at $1,417.51, up
0.2 percent.  Greenback Gains  The Bloomberg  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback
against 10 major counterparts, rose 0.4 percent to 1,028.68.  U.S. gross domestic product increased an annualized 2.2
percent in the second quarter, more than the 1.7 percent
previously estimated, a Bloomberg survey of economists forecast
that a government report tomorrow will show.  Canada’s GDP (CAGDPMOM)  shrank 0.4 percent in June, a separate
Bloomberg survey estimated before a report due Aug. 30. The
nation’s economy expanded 1.6 percent in the second quarter,
after growing 2.5 percent from January through March, economists
projected.  The  Bank of Canada  meets Sept. 4. The central bank has
maintained its benchmark  overnight rate  target at 1 percent
since September 2010 to support the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
