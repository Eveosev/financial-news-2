Finland ’s government raised 4
billion euros ($5.3 billion) in a sale of five-year euro-denominated bonds to replenish its coffers depleted by falling
tax revenue amid its second recession in four years.  The bond, maturing on Sept. 15, 2018, pays a coupon of
1.125 percent, the Helsinki-based State Treasury said in an e-mailed statement. The bonds were priced at 99.733 with a yield
of 1.180 percent. It received orders from 101 investors worth
6.9 billion euros.  “The issue generated wide interest among domestic
investors,” Deputy Funding Director Anu Sammallahti said after
the bond was priced. “About 20 percent of the bond was sold to
investors in Finland. The large number of pension funds was a
pleasant surprise in this maturity.”  Finland, which is yet to escape a recession that started
last year, is raising funds to pay for its 2013 budget deficit
after the country lowered a forecast for  tax revenue . The
economy will shrink 0.4 percent in 2013 and expand 1.4 percent
in 2014, according to a Bloomberg survey of 11 economists. The
northernmost euro member is the only country within the monetary
union to have an AAA rating with a stable outlook from all three
major credit rating companies.  Finland increased its net borrowing estimate for 2013 on
Aug. 23 by 15 percent to about 9 billion euros as the recession
erodes tax revenue. The higher funding target won’t pose a
problem to the treasury, which plans to distribute it among its
various instruments, Sammallahti said on Aug. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
