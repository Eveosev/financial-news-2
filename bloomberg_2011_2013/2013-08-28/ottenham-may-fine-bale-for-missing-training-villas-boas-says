Tottenham Hotspur agreed to sign AS
Roma winger Erik Lamela for 30 million euros ($40 million) as it
seeks to complete the sale of Gareth Bale to Real Madrid for
what may be a world-record fee.  Roma will receive a further 5 million euros from Spurs if
Argentina’s Lamela meets undisclosed sporting objectives,  the
Italian team said yesterday in a statement . Bale’s transfer to
Real could happen “very, very soon,” Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas said in a televised news conference.  Lamela, 21, scored  15 times in 33 league games  last season.
Roma paid Argentine team River Plate 12 million euros to sign
him in 2011, as well as 4.8 million euros to Netherlands-based
third parties, the Italian club said at the time.  Tottenham has already signed Roberto Soldado, Paulinho,
Nacer Chadli and Etienne Capoue in this transfer window for
about 60 million pounds ($93 million).  Villas-Boas said Tottenham may fine Bale, 24, after the
winger didn’t attend training the past two days. He’s been
linked with a possible 100 million-euro transfer to Real before
the Sept. 2 trade deadline.  That would exceed the 80 million pounds the Spanish club
paid Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009.  “He is involved in a big transfer move to Real Madrid and
in the end if it happens, we wish him all the best, but the fact
that he hasn’t turned up is not the correct behavior,” Villas-Boas said in yesterday’s press conference.  He added that “it’s up to the club to decide if it’s a
fine-able offense.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
