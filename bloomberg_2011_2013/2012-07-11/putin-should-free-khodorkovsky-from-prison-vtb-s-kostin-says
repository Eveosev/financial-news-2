Russian President  Vladimir Putin 
should free former Yukos Oil Co. billionaire  Mikhail
Khodorkovsky , Andrei Kostin, chief executive officer of state-
run lender VTB Group, said in a BBC interview.  “It’s a difficult question,” Kostin said in a video clip
posted on BBC’s website yesterday. “I think that probably
enough is enough.” he said. “It would be useful for the
president to release him.”  Khodorkovsky, 49, once Russia’s richest man, is serving 13
years in prison under two separate convictions for fraud, tax
evasion and oil embezzlement that he says are retribution for
funding parties opposed to Putin. The government denies the
accusations. Khodorkovsky was arrested at gunpoint on the tarmac
of a Siberian airport in 2003.  Still, Kostin told the  BBC  that “you never forget the
‘Godfather’ book, which starts with, ‘Behind every great fortune
there is a crime.’”  To contact the reporter on this story:
