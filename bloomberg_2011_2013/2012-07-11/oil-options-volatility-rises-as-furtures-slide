Crude-oil options volatility slid
after underlying futures climbed amid lower inventories and the
highest refinery rates in almost five years.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 33.87 percent at 4:35 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 35.76 percent yesterday.
September options are now more active than August.  Crude oil for September delivery advanced $1.89, or 2.2
percent, to settle at $86.19 a barrel on the Nymex.  U.S.  oil inventories  fell 4.7 million barrels to 378.2
million in the week ended July 6, according to the Energy
Department. Refineries  operated  at 92.7 percent of capacity, the
highest rate since July 2007.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
August $90 calls, which rose 9 cents to 26 cents a barrel at
4:40 p.m. with 4,526 lots trading. August $80 puts were the
second-most active options, with 3,451 lots changing hands as
they fell 30 cents to 13 cents a barrel.  Bearish Bets  Puts accounted for 58 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bearish bets accounted for 53 percent of the 166,607
contracts traded in the previous session.  January $110 calls were the most actively traded, with
10,000 lots changing hands. They lost 21 cents to $1.38 a
barrel. The next-most active options, August $80 puts, rose 19
cents to 43 cents on volume of 6,670.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 44,885
contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 39,983 lots and
December $72 puts with 35,411.  To contact the reporter on this story:
