Brazilian corn exports will show a
“significant rise” in the second half of the year, according
to Parana state, one of the South American country’s biggest
producers of the grain.  Brazil , which has shipped 1.8 million metric tons so far
this year, probably will export a total of 17 million tons this
year, the Parana government said today in an e-mailed report.  Corn shipments from Paranagua, Parana’s biggest port, rose
to 868,000 tons in the first half from 440,000 tons a year
earlier, according to the same report. Parana’s agriculture
secretary said 20 percent of the winter crop has been sold and 5
percent has been harvested.  Dry weather that has hurt U.S. production probably will
continue supporting global prices, Parana said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
