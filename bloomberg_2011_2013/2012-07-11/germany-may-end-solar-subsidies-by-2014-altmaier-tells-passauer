Germany â€™s states and the federal
government have reached an agreement that may end solar
subsidies as early as 2014, Passauer Neue Presse reported,
citing an interview with Environment Minister Peter Altmaier.  Subsidies will be stopped as soon as a total generation
capacity of 52,000 Megawatt is installed, the newspaper said,
