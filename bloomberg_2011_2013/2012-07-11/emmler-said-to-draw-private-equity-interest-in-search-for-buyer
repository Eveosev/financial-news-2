Temmler Group, a German contract-
manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, has drawn interest from private
equity bidders as it searches for a buyer, according to people
with knowledge of the situation.  The company, owned by trustees since last year, has hired
 Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  as an adviser to consider its options and non-
binding indicative offers were submitted around the end of June,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
plans are private. Temmler has annual sales of about 170 million
euros ($208 million).  The contract-manufacturing industry, fueled by the
outsourcing needs of drugmakers, is populated with about 140
companies in  Europe  alone and a drive to bring down costs while
meeting stringent regulatory standards is spurring
consolidation. Temmler’s business model is built on offering
manufacturing capability as well as services spanning clinical
trials, logistics and distribution. Competitors include
NextPharma.  A Temmler spokesman declined to comment. Lazard’s Richard
Creswell declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
