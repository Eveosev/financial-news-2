Ethanol futures fell a second day in
Chicago on speculation the surge in corn prices will erode
demand for the biofuel feedstock.  Prices slipped after an Energy Department report showed
ethanol  production  in the U.S. dropped 4.2 percent to 821,000
barrels a day last week, the lowest level since July 2010 and
the steepest weekly drop since April 2011.  “If corn prices continue to move up toward the $8 level,
we’re going to see considerable demand destruction over the next
couple months,” said  Terry Reilly , an analyst at Citigroup
Global Markets Inc. in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery declined 2.8 cents,
or 1.1 percent, to $2.44 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have increased 11 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped
5.5 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.47 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive decreased 5 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.41, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  declined 5 cents, or 1.9 percent, to
$2.53 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive slumped 4
cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.63.  Corn for December delivery slid 12.75 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $7.0475 a bushel in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
