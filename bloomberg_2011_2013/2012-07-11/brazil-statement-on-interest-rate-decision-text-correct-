Following is a translation of the
statement by  Brazil ’s central bank on its interest rate decision
today.  “The Copom considers that, at this moment, the risks for
the inflation path remain limited. The Committee also notes
that, up to now, given the fragility of the global economy, the
contribution of the external sector has been disinflationary.  Therefore, continuing the adjustment process of monetary
conditions, the Copom decided to reduce the Selic rate to 8.0
percent p.a., without bias.  Voting in favor of the reduction in the Selic rate to 8.0
percent are the following board members: President Alexandre
Antonio Tombini, Aldo Luiz Mendes,  Altamir Lopes , Anthero de
Moraes Meirelles, Carlos Hamilton Vasconcelos Araujo, Luiz Awazu
Pereira da Silva, Luiz Edson Feltrim and Sidnei Correa
Marques.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
