Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir
said anti-government protests in the country aren’t comparable
to the uprisings in North Africa and the  Middle East , the state-
run SUNA news agency reported.  “There is no Arab spring in Sudan, there’s just a burning
hot summer that we will burn our enemies with,” the Khartoum-
based agency quoted al-Bashir as saying today during the
inauguration of White Nile Sugar Co.  The protests started on June 16 when the government raised
transportation and fuel prices, boosted taxes and devalued the
currency to cope with the loss of about 75 percent of the
nation’s oil output when  South Sudan  seceded in July.  The protests expanded later into a movement calling for an
end to al-Bashir’s 23 years in power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
