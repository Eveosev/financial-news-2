Blackstone Group LP’s  Byron Wien 
said the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may climb past 1,400 this
year.  Wien, vice chairman of the advisory services unit of the
world’s biggest private-equity firm, recommended buying  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  shares and said the iPad maker is the “most innovative”
U.S. company. He said he’s also bullish on gold because the
metal will retain its value should global growth slow.  “When everybody is so negative it’s usually a good time to
take the other side,” he said today in a television interview
on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with Tom Keene. “I think we can
do better than 1,400.”  An advance to 1,400 would require a 4.4 percent increase in
the U.S. equity benchmark from yesterday’s close. The  S&P 500 
has gained 6.7 percent this year. Apple shares have surged 50
percent this year, while gold futures in New York are up 0.6
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
