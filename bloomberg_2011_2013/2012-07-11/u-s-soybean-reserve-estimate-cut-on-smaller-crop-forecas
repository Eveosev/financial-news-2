U.S. soybean  inventories  before
next year’s harvest will be 7.1 percent smaller than
forecast a month ago as unusually hot, dry weather reduces
this year’s crop production, the government said.  Supplies will total 130 million bushels on Aug. 31,
2013, down from 140 million projected in June, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a report, cutting
its estimate for a third straight month. The average
estimate of analysts and traders surveyed by Bloomberg News
was 137 million bushels. U.S. production will total 3.050
billion bushels, down 4.8 percent from 3.205 billion
forecast last month and 3.056 billion in 2011, the USDA
said..  “It’s a bare minimum carryover supply,”  Anne Frick ,
the senior oilseed analyst for Jefferies Bache LLC, said
yesterday in a telephone interview. “We have to somehow
ration usage around the world, or at least postpone usage
until next February when  South America  is expected to
harvest a big crop.”  Through yesterday, soybean futures on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade rose 27 percent this year, partly because
output declined in Brazil, the world’s second-biggest
producer, and Argentina, the third-largest. On July 9, the
price touched $15.7125, the highest for a most-active
contract since July 2008. The U.S. is the top grower.  Smaller soybean inventories may boost prices for
products including livestock feed, a key expense for meat
producers such as  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  and  Smithfield Foods
Inc. (SFD)   World soybean production  in the year beginning Oct. 1
may total 267.16 million metric tons, less than 271.03
million forecast in June, the department said. Global
output was estimated at 235.88 million tons this year.  Global inventories  on Sept. 30 will fall to 52.51
million tons, from 53.36 million forecast in June and 70.1
million a year earlier, the USDA said. World suplies before
the 2013 North American harvest will total 55.66 million
tons, down from 58.54 million estimated last month, the
USDA said. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected 2013
stockpiles to fall to 56.74 million, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
