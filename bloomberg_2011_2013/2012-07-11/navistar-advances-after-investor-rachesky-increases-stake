Navistar International Corp. (NAV) , which
is trying to develop a heavy-truck engine that meets 2010 U.S.
emission standards, rose as much as 6.1 percent after an
activist investor boosted his stake.  Navistar gained 5.2 percent to $23.10 at 10:45 a.m. in New
York, after reaching $23.28, the biggest intraday jump since
July 3. The shares have dropped 42 percent this year through
yesterday after plunging 35 percent last year. The shares slid
7.3 percent yesterday after truck-engine maker  Cummins Inc. (CMI) 
reduced its revenue forecast as demand and the economy slow.  Hedge-fund manager  Mark Rachesky  said in a filing that he
boosted his stake to 14.95 percent from 13.6 percent. He said in
a June 25 disclosure statement that he planned to talk to
management about the “business, operations, strategy and future
plans.” Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  boosted his stake in
Navistar last month to  11.9 percent .  Navistar, based in Lisle, Illinois, is struggling to meet
2010 federal emission standards for its 13-liter heavy-truck
engine. The company said July 6 it plans to augment its exhaust
gas recirculation method of meeting emission standards and would
have a 13-liter engine available by early next year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
