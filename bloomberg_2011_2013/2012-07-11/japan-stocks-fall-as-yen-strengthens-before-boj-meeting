     July 11 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell for a fifth day,
with the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  capping its longest losing
streak in three months, after the yen rose to a five-week high
against the euro, damping the earnings outlook for exporters as
the  Bank of Japan  starts a two-day policy meeting today.  Sony Corp. (6758) , a consumer-electronics company that gets 20
percent of its sales in  Europe , fell 2.2 percent. Inpex Corp.,
Japan’s No. 1 energy explorer, slid 2.2 percent after crude fell.
 Advantest Corp. (6857) , a maker of memory-chip testers, declined 3.3
percent after chip-equipment provider Applied Materials Inc. cut
sales and profit forecasts.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 0.1 percent to
8,851.00 at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. Trading volume was 17
percent below the 30-day intraday average. The broader Topix
Index slid 0.2 percent to 757.29, with 22 of its 33 industry
groups retreating. Shares pared losses on speculation China will
boost investment to shore up growth.  “The market is reflecting concerns an economic slowdown,
especially in developing nations, will damage exporters,” said
Goya Nakao, a senior investment manager at Sompo  Japan  Nipponkoa
Asset Management Co., which oversees about 5 trillion yen ($63
billion). “The yen’s level is within companies’ estimates, but
there’s a lingering upside risk for the currency.”  The Topix  rebounded  about 9 percent since June 4, when it
closed at its lowest since 1983, after euro leaders agreed to
ease bailouts for lenders and as speculation mounted central
banks around the world will ease policy.  The gain has boosted the average price of shares on the
Japanese gauge to 0.9 times book value, compared with 2.1 times
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.4 times for the Europe
Stoxx 600 Index. A number below one means investors can buy
companies for less than the value of their assets.  Yen Strengthens  The yen touched 97.10 against the euro today, the highest
since June 5, and rose to 79.21 per dollar yesterday, the
strongest since June 29. Japanese manufacturers expect the
currency to trade at an average of 78.95 against the greenback
through March, according to the Tankan survey released July 2. A
stronger yen cuts the value of overseas earnings when
repatriated and weighs on Japan’s export-driven economy.  Exporters to Europe and the U.S fell. Sony slid 2.2 percent
to 1,023 yen.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a construction machinery maker that
gets 34 percent of its sales in the Americas and Europe, dropped
0.9 percent to 1,801 yen.  With the Bank of Japan meeting closing tomorrow, 10 of 17
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expect no change to monetary
policy after sentiment among large manufacturers improved to
minus 1 in the quarter ended June from minus 4 the previous
period, the Bank of Japan’s Tankan survey showed last week. The
central bank raised the economic assessment of all Japan’s nine
regions for the first time since October 2009.  China Growth  Shares pared losses as Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said the
country needs to maintain “a certain amount” of economic
growth, according to a State Council statement posted on the
central government’s website yesterday. He called for private
investments in railway, public utilities, energy and
telecommunication companies, health care and education.  Energy shares slid as crude oil for August delivery
declined $2.08 to settle yesterday at $83.91 a barrel on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange .  Inpex Corp. (1662)  lost 2.2 percent to
437,000 yen. Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. dropped 3.7 percent
to 2,958 yen.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 5.1 percent to 18.80,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.4 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Semiconductor-related shares fell after Applied Materials
cut its fiscal 2012 sales and profit forecasts amid weakness in
Europe and China. For the year through October, sales won’t
reach the previous projection of $9.1 billion to $9.5 billion,
the  Santa Clara , California-based company said yesterday.  Advantest dropped 3.3 percent to 1,100 yen.  Renesas
Electronics Corp. (6723) , a chipmaker, declined 7.9 percent to 291 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
