UBS AG (UBSN) ’s office in Bordeaux was
raided yesterday by French authorities investigating alleged
assistance in  tax evasion , according to a person with knowledge
of the matter.  French investigators confiscated hard drives, documents and
questioned employees, said the person, who asked not to be
identified as the investigation is ongoing. Yesterday’s raid
follows the searches of UBS offices in Strasbourg and Lyon last
month, according to the person.  An unidentified executive in UBS’s French unit was charged
last month in the tax investigation, Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, a
spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutors’ office, said on June 29.
The charges were the first brought in the probe, which was
opened in April after a preliminary inquiry by the French
customs service into a February 2011 complaint by the Prudential
Control Authority,  France ’s banking regulator.  UBS France is “fully cooperating with the French
authorities,” Yves Kaufmann, a spokesman for Zurich-based UBS,
said by phone. Thibault-Lecuivre didn’t immediately return calls
for comment on the searches.  Agence France-Presse  reported the raid on the Bordeaux
office late yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
