The dollar rose to a two-year high
versus the euro after minutes of the  Federal Reserve ’s June
meeting disappointed speculators who had bet policy makers would
signal a need for more monetary stimulus, driving investors to
the greenback as a refuge against slower global economic growth.  The U.S. currency extended gains versus the euro and the
yen as the minutes, released today, showed “a few” policy
makers said the central bank will probably need to take further
action to boost the labor market.  “The fact that the minutes weren’t as dovish as many
investors had expected has given a boost to the U.S. currency,”
said  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst in  Washington  at Western
Union Business Solutions, a unit of Western Union Co. “The fact
that officials have kept the door open to more easing steps this
year has limited the positive thrust the dollar received.”  The dollar advanced as much as 0.3 percent against the euro
to $1.2213, the strongest level since July 2010, before trading
at $1.2239 at 5 p.m.  New York  time, up 0.1 percent. The
greenback gained 0.4 percent to 79.76 yen after falling 0.4
percent earlier. The Japanese currency fell 0.3 percent versus
the euro to 97.63 after gaining earlier to 97, the strongest
since June 4.  Dollar Index  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trade partners touched 83.610, the highest since July 2010,
before trading at 83.496, up 0.1 percent.  If the index advances above the 83.54 level, the June 1
high, it will strengthen to as much as 85.32, the 78.6 percent
Fibonacci retracement of a two-year decline that began in June
2010, according to  MacNeil Curry , head of foreign-exchange and
interest-rates technical strategy at Bank of America Corp. in
New York. A decline below 83 would suggest the rally was
stalling, and a drop to 80.73 would negate it, Curry said in an
interview.  The dollar gained 0.2 percent over the past month versus
nine developed-nation counterparts tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro and the Swiss franc were
the biggest losers, each falling 2.2 percent. The Australian
dollar rose 3.4 percent, the biggest winner, and  New Zealand ’s
dollar gained 3.1 percent.  Minutes of the Fed’s June 20 meeting show two participants
said additional bond purchases are appropriate, while two others
said they would be warranted in the absence of “satisfactory
progress” in cutting unemployment or if downside risks
increase.  ‘Risk Off’  “There’s clearly been a risk-off reaction to the
minutes,”  Richard Franulovich , a senior currency strategist at
Westpac Banking Corp. in New York, said in a telephone
interview. “The implied observation would be that the market
was clearly looking for something more.”  Policy makers at the meeting extended through 2012 the
Operation Twist program to lengthen the maturities of assets on
the Fed’s balance sheet in a bid to reduce borrowing costs.
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said after the session the Fed is
prepared to “take additional steps” if the labor market fails
to improve.  U.S. payrolls increased by 80,000 jobs in June, Labor
Department data showed last week, trailing a Bloomberg News
survey forecast for a gain of 100,000. Private employment, which
excludes government agencies, grew 84,000, the weakest in 10
months.  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of bonds from 2008 to 2011 in
two rounds of a tactic called quantitative easing to spur
economic growth.  Aussie Dollar  The Australian dollar climbed to a record high against the
euro as commodities gained and consumer sentiment in the nation
rose to the highest level since February. The Aussie rose versus
all of its 16 most-traded peers tracked by Bloomberg. It gained
as much as 0.7 percent to A$1.1935 per euro before trading at
A$1.1940. The currency rose 0.6 percent to $1.0251.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials gained
1.1 percent. An index of Australian consumer sentiment advanced
3.7 percent in July to 99.1, according to a report today from
Westpac Banking Corp. and the Melbourne Institute.  The euro “may drift lower” against the Aussie now that it
has fallen below the $1.2000 level, Boris Schlossberg,  New York- 
based managing director of foreign exchange at the investment
advisory firm BK Asset Management, wrote today in a note to
clients.  Canada ’s dollar rose 0.3 percent to C$1.0198 amid a rise in
crude oil, the nation’s biggest export. Crude for August
delivery gained 2.7 percent to $86.15 a barrel in New York.  The  Mexican peso  gained versus all of its major
counterparts except the Aussie, appreciating 0.6 percent to
13.3063 to the  U.S. dollar . Oil is  Mexico ’s second-biggest
export.  “The rebound that we’ve seen in oil has been very
supportive to these currencies,” Western Union’s Manimbo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
