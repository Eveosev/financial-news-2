Oil rose as the U.S. Energy
Department reported that crude supplies dropped and refineries
operated at the highest rate in almost five years.  Futures climbed 2.3 percent as  inventories  fell 4.7 million
barrels to 378.2 million last week, more than three times the
decline forecast in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Refineries
 operated  at 92.7 percent of capacity, the highest rate since
July 2007.  “The 4.7 million-barrel drop in crude stocks was a big
shock, which pushed the market higher,” said Jason Schenker,
president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based
energy consultant.  Oil for August delivery advanced $1.90 to settle at $85.81
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are down 13
percent this year.  Brent oil for August climbed $2.26, or 2.3 percent, to
settle at $100.23 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate crude, the grade traded in New York, widened to
$14.42 from $14.06 yesterday.  Crude oil stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for WTI, declined 859,000 barrels to 46.8 million last
week, the biggest percentage drop since January.  Crack Spread  Refinery utilization has climbed 8.9 percentage points in
the last three months as the profit from making fuel has gained.
The margin as expressed by the so-called crack spread rose to
$31.08 a barrel yesterday, the highest level since April 16. The
profit to process three barrels of oil into two of gasoline and
one of heating oil slipped to $30.38 based on today’s settlement
prices.  “When refineries are operating at high rates, it’s pretty
natural that crude stocks will post a big decline and there will
be a build in product supplies,” said  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York.  Gasoline stockpiles  rose 2.75 million barrels to 207.7
million, more than five times the gain of 500,000 barrels
projected in the Bloomberg survey.  Supplies of distillate fuel ,
a category that includes heating oil and diesel, rose 3.11
million barrels to 120.9 million. A 625,000-barrel increase was
projected.  “The large gain in product stocks is taking a bite out of
the gain you would usually expect when there’s such a big drop
in crude inventories,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The
product supply number points to weak fundamentals.”  Fuel Demand  Total  fuel use  dropped 1.1 percent to 19 million barrels a
day in the four weeks ended July 6, the biggest decline since
February.  Gasoline consumption  fell 0.6 percent to 8.87 million
barrels a day during the same period, leaving demand 3.9 percent
lower than a year earlier.  “The demand numbers are anemic and it’s important to
remember that crude stocks are barely off their 22-year highs,”
McGillian said.  U.S. crude oil inventories increased to 387.3 million
barrels in June, the highest level since 1990.  Oil prices  retreated from the day’s highs after Federal
Reserve minutes showed a few policy makers believe further
action will be needed to boost the labor market, disappointing
investors looking for a stronger signal of more stimulus.  ‘Somewhat Tepid’  The minutes of the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s June
19-20 gathering showed that two participants said more bond
purchases are appropriate and two others said they would be
warranted in the absence of “satisfactory progress” in cutting
unemployment or if risks increase.  “The Fed minutes were somewhat tepid,” Schenker said.
“They show that the FOMC is pretty split and that the bar for
further stimulus is pretty high.”  New York futures have technical support along the middle
Bollinger Band on the daily chart, around $83.40 a barrel today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures rebounded
yesterday after trading near that indicator. Buy orders tend to
be clustered close to chart-support levels.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 460,575
contracts as of 3:46 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 513,775
contracts yesterday, 9.5 percent below the three-month average.
Open interest was 1.41 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
