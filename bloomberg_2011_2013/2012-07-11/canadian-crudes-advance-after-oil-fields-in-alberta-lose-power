Canadian crude oils gained against
the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate as  Alberta  oil
producers recovered from an electricity curtailment.  The Alberta Electric System Operator directed the
province’s power distributors to reduce their load by 200
megawatts on July 9 after electricity demand reached record
highs and six power generators reported unplanned outages. ATCO
Electric Ltd. cut power to some industrial customers, including
oil-field operations, said  Chris Clark , vice president of
transmission for the company’s operations division.  Western Canada Select, a heavy, sour Canadian-blended
crude, advanced for the fifth straight day, rising $3.50 to
$18.50 a barrel under WTI at 3:51 p.m. in  New York , data
compiled by Bloomberg showed. That’s the highest level for the
oil since May 25. Syncrude, a synthetic oil upgraded from tar-
like bitumen in Alberta into refinery-ready crude, strengthened
50 cents to $1.50 a barrel below WTI.  “The curtailment was only in effect for a few hours,”
Clark said by telephone from Edmonton. “The particular sites
that were impacted were completely cut off during that time.”  Clark declined to say which oil producers were affected by
the service interruption.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet gained for the fourth day, rising
$1.20 to a premium of $16.25 a barrel against WTI, the highest
level for the oil since June 7. Light Louisiana Sweet advanced
for the seventh day, increasing 60 cents to $14.60 a barrel
above WTI, the highest since June 22.  Gulf Coast  Crude-processing rates  at refineries in the U.S.  Gulf
Coast , known as the Padd 3 region, increased for a second week,
rising 1.5 percent to 8.14 million barrels a day in the seven
days ended July 6, the Energy Department said.  Poseidon strengthened 70 cents to $9.60 a barrel above WTI,
and Southern Green Canyon rose 75 cents to a premium of $9.25.
Mars Blend added 60 cents to $10.60 a barrel over WTI.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, increased 90 cents to
a $13.40 premium versus WTI.  Bakken oil was unchanged at a discount of $5.75 a barrel
against the U.S. benchmark.  To contact the reporters on this story:
