Telefonica SA (TEF) ,  Spain ’s biggest phone
company, said it has received several offers for the call-center
unit it wants to sell to reduce debt.  Telefonica is seeking about 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion)
for the division, Atento Inversiones & Teleservicios SAU, and
Bain Capital Partners LLC is among potential bidders, three
people familiar with the matter said June 8.  The Madrid-based operator is now analyzing the terms and
conditions of the offers, it said in a statement today. The
company didn’t disclose the identity of bidders or the size of
the offers. A Telefonica official declined additional comment
when contacted by Bloomberg News today.  Chief Executive Officer Cesar Alierta is accelerating the
sale of non-core assets as the former monopoly struggles to
reduce 57 billion euros of debt. Telefonica tried to sell Atento
as early as 2007, and a year ago shelved plans for an initial
public offering. With about 156,000 employees, about half of the
company’s total, Atento generated 1.8 billion euros in 2011
revenue, compared with 62.8 billion euros reported by the parent
company.  Telefonica would be willing to sell a majority stake in
Atento for 750 million euros to 850 million euros, El
Confidencial reported  earlier  today. Telefonica would sell 75
percent of Atento and keep the remaining stake for a number of
years, the financial news website said.  In May, Telefonica set a target to raise at least 1.5
billion euros from asset disposals. Atento will be the biggest
asset sale, Finance Chief Angel Vila said.  Telefonica rose 1.5 percent to 10.07 euros at 12:55 p.m. in
 Madrid , valuing the company at 45.8 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
