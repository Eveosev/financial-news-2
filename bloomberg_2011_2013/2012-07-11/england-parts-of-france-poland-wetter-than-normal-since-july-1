England, the center-south of  France 
and the border region of  Germany  and Poland were wetter than
normal in the past 10 days, U.S. Department of Agriculture
satellite data showed.  Spain, Bulgaria and Romania received less than 50 percent
of normal rainfall from July 1 to July 10, while northwest
Germany also got less rain than usual, the data  show .  Rainfall across all of Germany’s northern wheat-growing
areas has been below normal since March 1, according to the
data. Dry weather may hurt this year’s grain harvest, adding to
frost damage to the winter-grain area, farm lobby Deutscher
Bauernverband wrote in June.  Cumulative rainfall in most wheat-growing regions of France
has been in line with the long-term average, according to the
USDA data. In  England , rainfall has been more than usual, the
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
