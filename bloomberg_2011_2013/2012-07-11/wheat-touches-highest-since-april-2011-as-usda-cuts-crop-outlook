Wheat rose to the highest since
April 2011 after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  reduced its
forecast for global production after dry weather curbed crops in
 Russia .  In the 12 months that started June 1, world output will
total 665.3 million metric tons, down 1 percent from a June
estimate, the USDA said in a report today. The agency cut its
forecast for Russian production by 7.5 percent to 49 million
tons and lowered its outlook for exports from the nation by 25
percent.  “The 30 to 40 percent losses in some areas of Russia are
borne out by this production number today,” Mike Zuzolo, the
president of Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting in
Lafayette, Indiana, said by telephone. “These numbers confirm
the losses” from the dry weather in Russia, he said.  Wheat futures for September delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
settle at $8.2625 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after touching $8.485, the highest since April 27, 2011.
The price has jumped 28 percent since the end of May, partly
because of dry weather in parts of Russia and Ukraine.  Futures earlier dipped as much as 2.2 percent after the
USDA said the Kansas wheat crop would be the biggest since 2003.
“If you can get a break, you will have guys willing to step in
and buy it,”  Jason Britt , the president of Central States
Commodities Inc. in  Kansas City ,  Missouri , said by telephone.
“I’m still a little hard-pressed to say that the highs are
in.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
