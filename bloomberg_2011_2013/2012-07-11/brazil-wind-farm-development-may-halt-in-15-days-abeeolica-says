Wind-farm developers in  Brazil  may
be forced to halt construction on some projects within 15 days
because the state development bank BNDES is freezing financing
for turbines purchased from suppliers it claims aren’t meeting
local-content requirements.  Without loans from Brazil’s biggest wind-farm financier,
developers are unable to pay for equipment they’ve already
agreed to buy, Elbia Melo, executive president of the Sao Paulo-
based wind-energy trade group Associacao Brasileira de Energia
Eolica, said today in a telephone interview.  BNDES, formally Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico
e Social, temporarily suspended loans last month for turbines
from five foreign manufacturers with operations in Brazil that
it says aren’t obtaining enough components from domestic
suppliers.  “If this goes on for another 15 to 20 days, projects will
stop,” Melo said. Suppliers like India’s  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) 
“are already losing new clients.”  BNDES suspended financing for equipment from Suzlon,
Denmark’s  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , Germany’s Fuhrlaender AG,
Clipper Windpower Ltd. of the U.S and Spain’s Acciona SA, Melo
said.  They are initially required to get 40 percent of their
components from Brazilian suppliers. The local-content
requirement eventually rises to 60 percent on a schedule that
varies by supplier, and BNDES may decide next week to extend
those shifts, Melo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
