Credit Suisse Group AG cut its price
forecast for  thermal coal at Australia’s Newcastle  port as it
expects prices to remain under pressure before output cuts can
balance oversupply.  Prices for delivery this year will average $98 a metric
ton, the bank said today in a report. That’s 13 percent less
than its forecast in April.  “Tentative signs of supply discipline have begun to emerge
but more significant cutbacks and project deferrals will need to
emerge,” analysts including Andrew Shaw, head of base-metals
and bulk-commodities research at Credit Suisse in  Singapore ,
said in the report.  The scale of demand from Asian buyers will help balance the
market, supporting Credit Suisse’s long-term forecast of $120 a
ton, the bank said.  “Though the market is currently oversupplied, demand
growth in the coming years will still require significant supply
side additions and, at current prices, miners do not face
sufficient incentives to invest in these requisite projects,”
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
