Given Imaging Ltd. (GIVN)  rose to snap a
two-day decline in  New York  after  Japan  said it will reimburse
patients for use of two of its treatments.  The Israeli maker of swallowable pill-sized cameras for
digestive diagnosis added 0.5 percent to $16.87 in New York
after earlier rising 2.7 percent to a six-week high. The Tel
Aviv shares ended little changed at 67.19 shekels, or the
equivalent of $16.93.  Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has issued
reimbursement codes for Given Imaging’s PillCam Patency Capsule
and SB video capsule for the 105 million adults in the country,
according to a statement today. The Asia Pacific and Japan
region accounted for 14 percent of the Yokneam, Israel-based
company’s revenue in 2011, and the Europe,  Middle East  and
Africa region encompassed 25 percent of tis sales, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “This indicates that more doctors can use the pillcam with
patients in Japan,” Bryan Brokmeier, an analyst at Maxim Group
LLC, said by phone from New York yesterday. “That’s completely
going to help support their growth in the back half of this year
and makes investors feel more comfortable looking at the longer-
term opportunities for the company.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
