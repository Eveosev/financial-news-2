German tax authorities didn’t pay
for data giving the names of Credit Suisse’s account holders
probed for alleged  tax evasion ,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing
unidentified people close to the matter.  A Credit Suisse employee mistakenly sent the list in June
after the bank reached an agreement with the tax office to co-
operate and deliver information in September 2011 provided it
didn’t breach data-privacy law, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
