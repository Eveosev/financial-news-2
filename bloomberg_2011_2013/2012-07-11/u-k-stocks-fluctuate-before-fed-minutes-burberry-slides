Most  U.K. stocks  declined as
disappointing company earnings added to signs the global economy
is slowing.  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY)  sank 7.4 percent after first-quarter
sales growth trailed analyst estimates. Aggreko Plc and  Johnson
Matthey (JMAT)  Plc lost at least 3 percent after U.S. peer Cummins Inc.
cut its revenue forecast. ARM Holdings Plc and  Aviva (AV/)  Plc paced
advancing shares.  The FTSE 100 Index rose 0.41 point, or less than 0.1
percent, to 5,664.48 at the close in  London  as investors awaited
minutes from last month’s  Federal Reserve  meeting. The volume of
shares changing hands on the gauge was 34 percent lower than the
30-day average, according to Bloomberg data. The broader FTSE
All-Share Index slipped 0.1 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index increased 0.1 percent.  “Markets are in a downbeat mood today with clients holding
back from building positions after the second-quarter U.S.
earnings season kicked off on a sour note,” said Ishaq Siddiqi,
a market strategist at at ETX Capital in London. “All eyes are
now on the Fed’s meeting minutes.”  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. plunged 11 percent in U.S.
trading yesterday after the second-biggest maker of processors
for personal computers reported an unexpected drop in sales.
Applied Materials Inc. also declined in  New York  after the
chipmaking-equipment provider cut its forecasts.  Growth Support  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  has advanced 7.7 percent from its 2012 low on
June 1 as central banks and policy makers took steps to support
global growth. The index has risen 1.7 percent this year.  The Fed is scheduled to release the minutes of its June
meeting at 2 p.m. in  Washington . The  Federal Open Market
Committee  said on June 20 it would expand its Operation Twist
program to extend the maturities of assets on its balance sheet.  Burberry dropped 7.4 percent to 1,189 pence after the
U.K.’s largest luxury-goods maker reported an 11 percent
increase in first-quarter sales to 408 million pounds ($634
million). That missed the average  analyst estimate  of 417.8
million pounds, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Auto-industry suppliers also fell after Cummins, a U.S.
maker of truck engines, reduced its revenue forecast as demand
weakens on slowing global growth.  Aggreko (AGK) , which is a supplier to Cummins, dropped 4.3
percent to 1,993 pence while Johnson Matthey, a producer of a
third of all autocatalysts, slid 3 percent to 2,103 pence. UBS
AG also downgraded Johnson Matthey’s shares to neutral from buy.  Britvic Slides  Britvic Plc (BVIC)  sank 13 percent to 260.1 pence, the biggest
drop since March 2006, after the maker of Robinsons fruit drinks
said full-year results will be at the lower end of analyst
estimates and warned that a recall of its Fruit Shoot products
will hurt earnings further.  Hays Plc lost 3.4 percent to 70.55 pence after the
recruitment company reported an easing in like-for-like net fee
growth to 2 percent for the fourth quarter. That’s down from 10
percent in the third quarter.  ARM paced advancing shares after Bank of America Corp.
resumed coverage of the chipmaker with a buy recommendation. The
analysts also named the company their top pick among ARM’s
European rivals. The stock climbed 1.6 percent to 488 pence.  Aviva increased 1.5 percent to 290.8 pence as Morgan
Stanley upgraded the insurer to overweight, the equivalent of a
buy recommendation, saying the company’s restructuring plan that
will help “restore capital and profitability.”  Aviva also completed the sale of 37.2 million shares in
Delta Lloyd NV.  ICAP Increases  ICAP Plc (IAP)  rose 1.2 percent to 314.8 pence after the world’s
largest broker of transactions between banks said full-year
pretax profit will be in the middle of the 335 million-pound to
365 million-pound range of analyst estimates. ICAP earned 354
million pounds for the 12-month period ended in March 2012.  Chief Executive Officer  Michael Spencer  said in a statement
that widening international probes into a Libor scandal were not
a “high concern” as ICAP is not “front and forward” in
investigations. The shares have fallen about 12 percent since
Barclays Plc was fined 290 million pounds for false Libor
submissions.  JD Wetherspoon Plc rose 3.8 percent to 437.9 pence after
the pub owner reported a 6.1 percent increase in like-for-like
sales for the 11 weeks to July 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
