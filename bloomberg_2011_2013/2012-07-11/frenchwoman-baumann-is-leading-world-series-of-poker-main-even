France ’s Gaelle Baumann is leading
the  World Series of Poker ’s main event as she tries to become
the second woman in the tournament’s 43-year history to reach
the final table.  About half of the 4,344 players who advanced to Day 2 of
the $10,000 buy-in No-Limit Texas Hold’em World Championship,
known as the main event, have completed play. Baumann, 29, has
505,800 in chips to lead Canadian Mark Demirdjian’s 499,900,
while 840 others advanced to Day 3. The other half of the field
will play Day 2 today and then both surviving groups will be
combined.  The tournament, which will award $8.5 million to the
winner, has drawn 6,598 entrants, making it the fifth-largest
live poker tournament in history. There were 211 female
entrants, or 3.2 percent.  The only woman to reach the final table of the main event
was Barbara Enright, who finished fifth in 1995, when there were
273 overall entrants.  The 61-event  World Series  of Poker is being held at the Rio
All-Suite Hotel & Casino in  Las Vegas . The tournament will play
down to nine competitors on July 16. Those remaining will return
in late October to crown a champion.  Baumann  finished 15th  in an earlier World Series event, the
$1,000 buy-in Ladies Championship, winning $7,716. She also won
$5,265 with a 123rd-place finish in a $2,500 buy-in event.  Jeremy Wien, an options trader at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.,
advanced to Day 3 for the fourth straight year. He has 24,400 in
chips remaining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
