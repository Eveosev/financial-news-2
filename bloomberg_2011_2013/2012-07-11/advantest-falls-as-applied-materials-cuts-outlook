Advantest Corp. (6857) , the world’s biggest
maker of memory-chip testers, fell to the lowest level in a
month in Tokyo trading as  Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) ’s cut to
forecasts heightened concerns about the industry’s outlook.  Advantest  dropped  as much as 4.7 percent to 1,084 yen, the
lowest since June 6, and traded at 1,100 yen as of 10:32 a.m.
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined 0.6 percent.  Chip-related companies including Applied Materials and
 Tokyo Electron Ltd. (8035)  have said sales may remain weak,
contributing to Advantest’s 12 percent drop in the past four
days. Santa Clara, California-based Applied Materials, which
manufactures chipmaking equipment, said yesterday net sales will
fall short of a forecast of $9.1 billion to $9.5 billion for the
12 months ending Oct. 28.  Demand in Europe and China is ebbing, Applied Materials
Chief Executive Officer Mike Splinter said yesterday in  San
Francisco . That echoed remarks from  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) ,
the second-biggest maker of processors for PCs, which earlier
this week blamed those regions for an unexpected drop in second-
quarter sales.  Tokyo Electron, the world’s second-largest maker of
semiconductor production equipment, said July 6 orders in the
three months ended June 30 plunged 28 percent to 79 billion yen
($996 million) from the preceding quarter.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330) , the world’s largest
contract manufacturer of chips, fell 1.4 percent to NT$78 as of
9:30 a.m. in Taipei. TSMC plans to spend a record $8 billion to
$8.5 billion on equipment and facilities this year, it said
April 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
