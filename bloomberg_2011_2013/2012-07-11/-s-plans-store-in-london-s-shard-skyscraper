Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS) , the
U.K.’s largest clothing retailer, will open a store in  London 
skyscraper the Shard, western Europe’s tallest building.  “The little bit of retail space is fully leased,”
developer  Irvine  Sellar said in a June 29 interview. “Nothing
other than the standard brands” for railway stations will
occupy the space, which is adjacent to the London Bridge train
terminal.  WH Smith Plc, a U.K. book retailer and stationer with more
than 1,100 stores, opened a shop in the tower this week, the
company said by e-mail. Marks & Spencer will have a franchised
Simply Food store in the building, according to the London-based
retailer.  The Shard has 5,000 square feet (465 square meters) of
retail space, which opens into the train station.  London Bridge 
is used by 55 million passengers a year and that will rise to
more than 90 million starting in 2018, Network Rail Ltd. said in
 March . The increased foot traffic should boost rents, increasing
the values of the shops.  The tower and neighboring office building the Place are 95
percent owned by the State of Qatar with the remaining 5 percent
held by Sellar’s Sellar Property Group.  Marks & Spencer’s U.K. same-store sales fell 2.8 percent in
the first quarter ended June 30, the company said yesterday,
compared with the median analyst estimate for a 2.5 percent
drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
