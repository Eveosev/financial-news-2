KB Home (KBH) , the Los Angeles-based house
builder, said it would sell unsecured debt to fund an offer to
buy back as much as $150 million of bonds.  The company is seeking to repurchase most of its $193.7
million of 5.75 percent notes due February 2014 for as much as
104 cents on the dollar, KB Home said today in a statement. It
didnâ€™t say when it would sell the new bonds.  KB Home has about  $1.58 billion  of bonds outstanding,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Home sales at the
company dwindled to 5,812 last year from a record 32,124 in
fiscal 2006, according to regulatory filings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
