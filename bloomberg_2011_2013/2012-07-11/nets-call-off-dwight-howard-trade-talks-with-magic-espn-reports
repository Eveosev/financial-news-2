The Brooklyn Nets have ended talks
with the  Orlando Magic  on a trade for center  Dwight Howard ,  ESPN
said , citing people familiar with the negotiations who requested
anonymity.  The Nets decided to move on after their offer of center
Brook Lopez, forward Kris Humphries and four future first-round
draft picks was rejected by the Magic, ESPN reported. Magic
General Manager Rob Hennigan said today at a news conference
that talks with the Nets and other teams were ongoing.  The Los Angeles Lakers and Houston Rockets remain potential
trade partners with the Magic for Howard, ESPN said.  The 6-foot-10 Howard is a three-time NBA defensive player
of the year and has averaged 18.4 points and 13 rebounds over
eight seasons in Orlando.  To contact the reporter on this story:
