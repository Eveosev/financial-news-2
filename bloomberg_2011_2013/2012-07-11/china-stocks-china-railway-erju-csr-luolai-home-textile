 Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in China trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Shanghai.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, rose 0.5 percent to 2,175.38, snapping
two days of losses. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  advanced 0.8 percent to
2,425.57.  China Railway Erju Co. (600528)  (600528 CH), a rail construction
company, jumped 5.9 percent to 6.50 yuan, the biggest gain since
May 28.  CSR Corp. (601766)  (601766 CH), the nation’s biggest trainmaker,
advanced 4.5 percent to 4.38 yuan, the most since April 18.
Premier  Wen Jiabao  called for private investment in railway,
public utilities, energy and telecommunication companies, health
care and education, saying the country needs to maintain “a
certain amount” of economic growth, according to a State
Council statement posted on the central government’s website
yesterday.  China Southern Airlines Co. (600029)  (600029 CH), the nation’s
biggest carrier by fleet size, lost 2.2 percent to 4.54 yuan.
First-half profit probably dropped from a year earlier because
of slowing economic growth and higher jet-fuel prices, the
carrier said in a statement yesterday. The company also had
foreign-exchange losses after the Chinese currency’s decline
against the dollar, it said.  Luolai Home Textile Co. (002299)  (002293 CH), China’s biggest
manufacturer of home textile products, tumbled by the 10 percent
daily limit to 64.70  yuan  after the company said first-half
profit may have dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
