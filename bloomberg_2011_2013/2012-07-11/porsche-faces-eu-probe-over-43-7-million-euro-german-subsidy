Porsche AG faces a European Union
probe over a 43.7 million-euro ($53.7 million) subsidy from the
German government to help it build a compact sports-utility
vehicle.  The European Commission said it will review whether the
German grant is necessary to encourage the company to build its
new Macan model in Leipzig. Regulators will also check to see if
the state support hurts competition.  The EU investigation doesn’t change Porsche’s plans to
produce the car in Leipzig, said Hans-Gerd Bode, a spokesman for
Porsche AG.  “The construction work has already started and if the
grant is not approved, we will pay for it ourselves,” Bode
said.  Porsche’s Macan project will cost 521.6 million euros, the
EU said in an e-mailed statement. The company plans to start
selling the new model in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
