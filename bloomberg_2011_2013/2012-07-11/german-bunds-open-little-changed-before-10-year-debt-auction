German 10-year bond yields fell to a
one-month low after the nation’s borrowing costs dropped to the
least on record at a sale of 4.15 billion euros ($5.1 billion)
of debt.  Spain’s securities climbed for a second day as Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  detailed spending cuts in a speech in
parliament, while saying he expects future negotiations to
resolve the region’s financial woes to be tough. German  two-year
yields  fell below zero for a fourth day after a report affirmed
 inflation  in  Europe ’s biggest economy slowed in June. French
two- and five-year yields declined to records.  “It’s a constructive auction,” said Eric Wand, a fixed-
income strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in London. “Bids
were comfortably above market levels at the time of the sale.
With yields at these levels, it continues to tell the story that
core markets remain underpinned.”  The 10-year bund yield fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.27 percent at 4:28 p.m.  London  time and
reached 1.264 percent, the lowest since June 6. The 1.75 percent
security due July 2022 gained 0.475 or 4.75 euros per 1,000-euro
face amount to 104.455.  The two-year rate was at minus 0.013 percent after falling
to as low as minus 0,016 percent. It slid as low as minus 0.018
percent on July 6.  Germany ’s borrowing costs fell to a record-low 1.31 percent
in today’s auction of 10-year securities, according to a
statement from the Bundesbank. That’s down from 1.52 percent at
a June 13 sale.  Spanish Cuts  German yields plunged to  records  this year as investors
sought a haven from Europe’s financial turmoil. The 10-year rate
dropped to 1.127 percent on June 1, the least since Bloomberg
began collecting the data in 1989.  “Although yields are near all-time lows, fundamentally, we
would continue to buy bunds on dips given the lack of
fundamental progress in arresting the euro-area crisis,” fixed-
income strategists at Citigroup Inc., including Peter Goves in
London, wrote in an e-mailed report. “The very front-end of the
German curve is trading negative as appetite for core paper
remains the dominant driver across fixed-income markets,” he
wrote, referring to short-maturity German notes.  Spanish 10-year bonds rose, pushing down the yield by 23
basis points to 6.58 percent. The rate on similar-maturity
Italian debt dropped 14 basis points to 5.82 percent.  Spain  will cut spending and raise taxes to reduce the
deficit by 65 billion euros over the next 2 1/2 years, Rajoy
said today.  French Yields  Inflation, calculated using a harmonized European Union
method, eased to 2 percent, the lowest rate since January 2011,
from 2.2 percent in May, the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said today.  Volatility on German government debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, followed by Austria and  France ,
according to measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two-
and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  French five-year yields dropped below 1 percent for the
first time. The rate fell as much as eight basis points to 0.955
percent, the lowest since Bloomberg started tracking the data in
1990.  The nation’s 10-year yield slipped eight basis points to
2.32 percent, while its two-year rate declined as much as four
basis points to 0.156 percent, also a record low.  The yield on two-year Austrian debt fell to 0.093 percent,
the lowest since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1999,
while the nation’s five-year yield fell as much as eight basis
points to an all-time low of 0.789 percent.  Dutch Record  Dutch two-year rates also fell to a record, with yields
falling as much as four basis points to 0.04 percent.  German debt returned 3.6 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Italian securities earned 8
percent, while Spanish bonds lost 5.3 percent, the indexes show.  Bund futures expiring in September may rise a further 0.6
percent after breaching a so-called resistance level, according
to UBS AG.  The contract may target 145.52 after breaking above the
July 9 high of 144.28  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income
technical strategy in London, said in a telephone interview. The
futures traded 0.4 percent higher at 144.61.  Resistance refers to an area on a graph where analysts
expect sell orders to be clustered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
