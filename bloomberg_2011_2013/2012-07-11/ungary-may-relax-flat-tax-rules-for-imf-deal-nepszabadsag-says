Hungary may offer to relax rules
governing its “flat” tax system in return for a credit line
from the International Monetary Fund,  Nepszabadsag  reported,
citing unidentified government officials.  While Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  insists on keeping the
tax, he may compromise by abolishing a rule requiring a two-
thirds majority in parliament to change the tax, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
