Myanmar’s new investment law may
take effect as early as September if a joint session of
parliament approves the bill, according to Kan Zaw, deputy
minister of National Planning & Economic Development.  The law will be debated during the current parliamentary
session, he said in an interview in  Hong Kong  today. The
legislation will help boost investment in the former
dictatorship that has taken steps toward democracy, he said.  “Normally it takes about two months, up to September,”
Kan Zaw said. “After it’s approved by the Union parliament,
then it will take effect the next day.”  The draft law allows investors to lease land for 50 years,
with the possibility of two 10-year extensions, he said. Foreign
companies will be guaranteed a level playing field with local
businesses, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
