Germany ’s inflation rate dropped to
the lowest level in 17 months in June as energy prices declined.  Inflation, calculated using a harmonized European Union
method, eased to 2 percent, the lowest since January last year,
from 2.2 percent in May, the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said today, confirming a June 27 estimate. In the
month, consumer prices fell 0.2 percent.  Oil prices  have dropped 22 percent since the end of
February and are 10 percent lower than a year ago. The sovereign
debt crisis is also damping economic growth across the 17-nation
euro area, prompting the  European Central Bank  to last week cut
its  benchmark rate  to a record low of 0.75 percent. German
unemployment at a two-decade low and rising wages are helping
Europe’s largest economy to weather the turmoil.  “The crisis and the drop in oil prices mean that any
inflation threats have been banished in Germany,” said
 Alexander Koch , an economist at UniCredit Group in Munich. “At
the same time, the strong labor market and rising wages mean
that the inflation rate is unlikely to drop as much as in other
euro-area countries.”  ECB President  Mario Draghi  told lawmakers on July 9 that
euro-area inflation will drop below the bank’s 2 percent limit
in 2013 from 2.4 percent currently.  Non-harmonized German inflation slowed to 1.7 percent in
June from 1.9 percent, with prices declining 0.1 percent in the
month, the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
