Bank of New York Mellon Corp . and
 Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS)  have joined asset managers limiting
deposits to euro-denominated  money market funds  after the
 European Central Bank  lowered deposit rates to zero.  BNY Mellon’s move to restrict subscriptions in the 2.28
billion euro ($2.79 billion) BNY Mellon Euro Liquidity was
effective July 9, Patrice Kozlowski, a spokeswoman for the New
York-based bank, said today in a telephone interview. Northern
Trust closed the 2.14 billion euro Euro Fund to new investments,
John O’Connell, a spokesman for the Chicago-based company, said
in a telephone interview.  “We determined the action was in the best interest of
shareholders to reduce the impact of materially lower yields on
returns,” O’Connell said.  Money funds have been struggling to invest client assets at
a profit as interest rates globally are near record lows and
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis has reduced the supply of debt
viewed by the funds as safe. Managers have been forced to cut
fees to keep customer returns above zero, and some have
abandoned the business.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
 BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  each took similar steps with euro-denominated
money funds July 6, a day after the ECB reduced its benchmark
interest rate to a record low of 0.75 percent and took its
deposit rate to zero.  To contact the reporter on this story:
