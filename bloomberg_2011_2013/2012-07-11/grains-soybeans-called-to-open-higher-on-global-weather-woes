What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
higher on speculation that daily yield losses will continue
without widespread rain in the U.S. Midwest in the next 10 days,
 Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des
Moines , Iowa, said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher
on forecasts for persistent dry U.S. weather, increasing stress
on plants as they begin to reproduce, Roose said.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher as
dry weather forecast in parts of Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan
may reduce production and increase export demand for U.S.
supplies, Roose said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
