The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in  Asia  climbed, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia  index  of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  increased 2 basis points to 168.5 as of
8:53 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The benchmark has traded between 210 and 132.5 since Jan.
1, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan  index  rose 2 basis points to 177 as
of 9:24 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show. The gauge is
set for its highest close since July 9,  according to CMA, which
is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia  index  was unchanged at 181
basis points as of 10:20 a.m. in Sydney,  National Australia Bank
Ltd. (NAB)  prices show. The measure has ranged between 211 and 128
this year, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
