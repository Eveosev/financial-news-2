Russia watered down plans to impose
controls over the Internet that provoked accusations President
 Vladimir Putin  is seeking to stifle free speech.  A bill giving authorities the power to blacklist websites
without a court order was restricted to sites that contain child
pornography or promote drugs or suicide, according to a revised
draft posted today on opposition lawmaker Ilya Ponomaryov’s
 blog .  Websites that contain other illegal content for children
can only be shut down by court order, according to the draft.
The lower house of parliament, or State Duma, will vote on the
measure in the second of three readings today.  Putin, 59, who was re-elected as president in March after
four years as prime minister, is facing opposition street
protests organized through social-networking websites. OAO
Yandex, which operates  Russia ’s biggest search engine, joined
websites including Wikipedia and LiveJournal in opposing the
proposed law.  “We managed to block the main danger in the law in the
second reading,” Ponomaryov, from the Just Russia party, said
today on his blog. “They’ve taken out the vague notion of bad
content and the law is strictly limited to child pornography and
pedophilia.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
