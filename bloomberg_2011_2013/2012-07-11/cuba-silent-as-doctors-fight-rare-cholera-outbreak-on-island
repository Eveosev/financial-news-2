Cuba’s government has given little
information about a rare outbreak of cholera, fueling
speculation that the epidemic may be worse than initially
reported last week.  The  World Health Organization , which has an office in
 Havana  to alert governments of public health problems on the
island, received a notice from Cuban authorities on July 3
documenting 53 cases of cholera and three deaths, said Donna
Eberwine-Villagran, a spokeswoman for the Geneva-based group.  “We haven’t received any further updates,” Eberwine-
Villargran said in a phone interview today.  The Cuban government, which touts the achievements of its
public health system and sends teams of doctors to aid allies
across  Latin America , announced in  state-run media  on July 3
that the disease had been brought under control after it was
discovered in the western province of Granma.  The Cuban exile-blog Cafe Fuerte reported July 9 that there
may be 85 cases of cholera, citing comments made by a doctor on
a local television station in Granma.  Officials at the Health Ministry and the Pedro Kouri
Institute, which studies disease outbreaks, didn’t respond to
calls and emails from Bloomberg News.  Door-to-Door Visits  Doctors and nurses are going door-to-door in cities
including Manzanillo to screen for symptoms and hospitals have
been equipped to quarantine patients, said Conner Gorry, editor
of Medicc Review, an Oakland-based medical journal focusing on
Cuban health care.  “Although cholera came as a surprise, the country is well
prepared,” Gorry said in an e-mail from Havana.  The first cases of cholera were discovered in Cuba around
1833 and there have been only sporadic outbreaks of the disease
on the island since, according to a  study  published in Emerging
 Infectious Diseases  last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
