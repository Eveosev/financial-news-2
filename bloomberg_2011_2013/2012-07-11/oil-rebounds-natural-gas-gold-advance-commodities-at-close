The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities gained 0.5 percent to 609.06 at 4:59 p.m.
 Singapore  time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
rose 0.4 percent to 1510.4.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rebounded from the lowest close in more than a week in
 New York  on speculation that declines may have been excessive
amid shrinking stockpiles in the U.S., the world’s biggest crude
consumer.  Oil for August delivery gained as much as $1.09 to $85.00 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract fell $2.08 yesterday to $83.91, the
lowest close since July 2. Prices are down 14 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude fell 5 cents to $17.65 a barrel at noon Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This
crack spread, a measure of processing profit, narrowed from the
widest in six days.  High-sulfur  fuel oil  was down 6 cents at $1.81 a barrel
below Dubai crude, according to PVM. A bigger discount shows
wider losses for refiners turning crude into residual products.  PRECIOUS METALS  Spot gold advanced as much as 0.7 percent to $1,577.80 an
ounce and was at $1,575.85 at 3:01 p.m. in Singapore. The euro
was little changed against the dollar after dropping to a two-
year low yesterday, sending bullion down by 1.3 percent.  BASE METALS  Copper climbed after Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  vowed to
maintain growth in the world’s largest base-metals user and data
showed that U.S. job openings increased, boosting the demand
outlook.  Copper for three-month delivery rose as much as 0.6 percent
to $7,537 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, and traded
at $7,508 at 1:42 p.m. in  Shanghai . The contract fell as much as
1 percent yesterday to $7,482, the lowest level since June 29.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  December-delivery corn increased as much as 1.3 percent to
$7.265 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $7.22
at 2:59 p.m. in Singapore. The most-active contract gained to
$7.33 a bushel on July 9, the highest level since September, as
heat baked U.S. fields.  Soybeans for November delivery declined for a second day,
losing 0.2 percent to $15.3625 a bushel, after the most active
contract rose on July 9 to $15.7125, the highest level since the
global food crisis in 2008. Wheat for September delivery added
0.2 percent to $8.2325 a bushel, after trading at the highest
level since April 2011 on July 9.  December-delivery rubber lost 1.3 percent to end at 244.4
yen a kilogram ($3,081 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange, the lowest settlement level for the most-active

the period to June 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
