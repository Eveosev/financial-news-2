Canadian natural gas rose as U.S.
forecasters predicted hotter weather, signaling more demand for
fuel to run air conditioners.  August gas in  Alberta  advanced 3.9 percent, nearly
recouping yesterday’s 4.2 percent loss, as MDA EarthSat Weather
of Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted temperatures would increase
in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast next week.  “Strong demand from the heat, a continuously improving
storage picture and reduced drilling bodes well,”  Peter Linder ,
president of the DeltaOne Energy Fund in Calgary, said in a
telephone interview. “I expect gas prices to rise slowly but
steadily through summer and I expect to see $3.25 or even $3.50
gas come Nov. 11” on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Alberta gas for August delivery increased 8.5 cents to
C$2.27 per gigajoule ($2.10 per million British thermal units)
as of 3:30 p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Alberta gas has fallen 12 percent this year, from C$2.58 on
Dec. 31, and risen 40 percent from C$1.625 at the end of March.  Natural gas for August delivery on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange gained 11.6 cents to settle at $2.853 per million Btu.  Hotter Weather  “A strong upper-level ridge overhead and westerly flow at
the surface will combine to produce this next round of heat,
which should peak around midweek,” MDA said in a forecast today
for July 16-20. “The Midwest will also see plenty of heat,”
especially Tuesday to Wednesday, when upper 90s are expected in
Chicago.  The high in Chicago on July 17 may be 98 degrees Fahrenheit
(37 Celsius), according to MDA EarthSat. New York may reach 95
that day.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago
dropped 7.82 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.8386 per million Btu
on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line
that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 7.64 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $2.53 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices advanced 11.9 cents, or 4.3 percent,
to $2.6388.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.6 billion cubic
feet at 2:30 p.m. Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.9 billion
cubic feet at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main Line.  Flow Rate  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.06 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at Kingsgate was 745 million cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.87 billion cubic feet today, or 71 percent
of normal capacity of 2.62 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.73
billion cubic feet at 2:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
