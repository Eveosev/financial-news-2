Panasonic Corp. (6752)  fell the most in
almost seven months in Tokyo trading, leading declines among
Japanese electronics makers as the yen rose to a one-month high
against the euro.  Japan’s biggest appliance maker dropped as much as 6.1
percent to 573 yen and traded at 585 yen as of the 11:30 a.m.
break on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Sony Corp. (6758) , the nation’s
largest exporter of consumer electronics, fell 2.7 percent. A
stronger yen cuts the repatriated value of exporters’ overseas
earnings.  The euro fell to 97.10 yen, the weakest since June 5,
before trading at 97.27 at 12:04 p.m. in Tokyo. Panasonic  got 
9.5 percent of its sales from Europe last fiscal year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sony  relied  on the region for 20
percent of its sales.  “There’s a shift to domestic demand-related companies from
exporters,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600
million at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. in Tokyo.
“Panasonic and Sony are being sold.”  Panasonic and Sony also declined after  Hisense Electric
Co. (600060) , a Chinese electronics maker, said yesterday it will sell a
50-inch liquid-crystal display television for less than 100,000
yen ($1,260) in Japan this month. The plan may fuel a price war,
Akino said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
