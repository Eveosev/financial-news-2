Serbia ’s external liquidity
 indicators  deteriorated in May as the debt-servicing ratio
gained more than 14 percentage points and public debt topped 54
percent of economic output, the central bank said.  The debt-servicing ratio, the share of principal and
interest to export revenue, rose to 42.6 percent from 28.3
percent in April, according to an update of the central bank’s
external indicators report, posted on the Belgrade-based
institution’s website today.  Public debt rose to 54.4 percent of gross domestic product
in May, from 52.8 percent in April and 50.7 percent at the end
of the first three-month period, the report showed. Fiscal rules
limit public debt-to-GDP ratio at 45 percent.  Serbia’s new coalition government, which agreed on a
program outline yesterday, may need to ask the  International
Monetary Fund  to allow it to reschedule or write off debts,
Stojan Stamenkovic, chief economist at Serbia’s Economics
Institute, told reporters in Belgrade yesterday.  Debt repayments equaled 18 percent of GDP in May, up from
11.6 percent in April. Foreign debt rose to 79.3 percent of GDP
in May, a rise of 2.3 percentage points in the month, the report
showed.  The central bank’s report also showed preliminary data for
the current-account deficit of 219 million euros ($269 million)
in May, pushing the five-month total to 1.6 billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
