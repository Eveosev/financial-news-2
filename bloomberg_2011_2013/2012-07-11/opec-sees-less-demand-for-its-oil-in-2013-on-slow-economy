OPEC forecast lower demand for its
crude next year as global economic growth slows and predicted
markets will be “comfortable” because of increased supply from
outside the group.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, in its
first assessment for 2013, estimated its 12 members will need to
provide an average of 29.6 million barrels a day, or 300,000
less than the amount required this year. That’s about 1.8
million a day below current production rates for the group,
which accounts for about 40 percent of global supplies.  “In the coming year, the world economy is likely to face
continuing challenges from  Europe ’s sovereign debt burden and
its weak banking system,” OPEC’s Vienna-based secretariat said
today in its monthly report. “The deceleration in the emerging
economies and the recent easing in the U.S. recovery, due to
persistently high unemployment, are also expected to dampen
growth to some degree.”  Brent crude futures have fallen 23 from this year’s peak as
Europe’s debt turmoil intensified, trading near $99 a barrel
today in  London . OPEC’s projection of lower demand next year may
encourage members to fulfil the pledge made at their last
meeting in June to comply better with output limits. Iran, whose
output fell below  Iraq ’s last month, rescinded its calls for an
emergency meeting this week as crude prices stabilized.  OPEC output  slipped by 105,900 barrels a day last month to
31.36 million a day as production slump in  Iran , according to
secondary sources cited by the report. A European Union embargo
against the Islamic Republic took effect on July 1. That still
leaves total OPEC supply 1.36 million barrels higher than the
ceiling members agreed to respect at their June 14 gathering.  The group agreed at the meeting to comply more closely with
its existing output target of 30 million barrels a day.  Global Demand  Global oil demand will increase by 800,000 barrels a day to
average 89.5 million a day in 2013, as rising consumption in
emerging economies offsets a contraction among the most
industrialized nations. The world economy will expand by 3.2
percent in 2013, down from 3.3 percent this year, according to
OPEC. Consumption this year will rise by 900,000 barrels a day,
or 1 percent, little changed from last month’s estimates.  Supply growth outside the organization will take care of
the increase in global demand, OPEC estimates. Non-OPEC
producers, such as Canada, Russia and Brazil, will increase by
900,000 barrels a day to average 54 million in 2013. That
represents a stronger level of growth than this year’s 700,000
barrel-a-day increase.  Oil inventories among developed nations are “high,” and
rising in emerging economies, giving an “additional cushion to
the market,” according to OPEC.  The group’s members are  Algeria ,  Angola ,  Ecuador , Iran,
Iraq,  Kuwait , Libya, Nigeria,  Qatar ,  Saudi Arabia , the United
Arab Emirates and Venezuela. The organization is next scheduled
to meet on Dec. 12 in Vienna.  The  International Energy Agency , an adviser to consuming
nations, will release its monthly report on global oil supply
and demand tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
