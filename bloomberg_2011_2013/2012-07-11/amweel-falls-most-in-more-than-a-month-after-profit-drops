Tamweel fell the most in more than
month after the Dubai-based mortgage lender reported a 33
percent drop in second-quarter profit.  The shares lost 3.1 percent, the most since June 4, to 1.24
dirhams at 10:07 a.m. in Dubai. The benchmark Dubai Financial
Market General Index declined 0.3 percent.  Net income fell to 18.6 million dirhams ($5 million) from
27.7 million dirhams a year earlier as income from Islamic
financing declined, the company said. EFG-Hermes Holding SAE
estimated a profit of 36 million dirhams, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Tamweel said on July 4 that it won’t proceed with the sale
of residential mortgage-backed bonds “at this time based on
market feedback.” The company had planned to raise $235 million
from the sale of the floating-rate securities, which were rated
a provisional Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service, its fourth-
highest investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
