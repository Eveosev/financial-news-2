Airbus SAS (EAD)  won an order for five
A330 wide-body jets from lessor  CIT Group Inc. (CIT)  and  Boeing Co. (BA) 
said it agreed with Avolon Aerospace Leasing Ltd. to sell as
many as 30 single-aisle planes.  The CIT sale follows an accord earlier this year with the
New York-based company for five more A330s, according to a
statement issued today at the Farnborough air show. The new
planes would have a list value of about $1.1 billion, based on
average retail prices for passenger models in the A330 family.  Boeing’s agreement with Dublin-based Avolon is for 15
planes from the 737 Max family with upgraded engines and 10 from
the current version of the top-selling 737 line. It also
includes reconfirmation rights for five more Max jets and has a
list-price value of $2.3 billion, Boeing said in a statement.  Airbus announced a separate agreement with China Aircraft
Leasing Co. for 36 single-aisle planes, including eight A321s,
the largest model in the A320 line. Once it’s confirmed as an
order, the purchase would have a list value of $3.3 billion,
based on retail prices. Airlines typically buy at a discount.  Airbus is introducing the A320neo with upgraded engines to
boost  fuel efficiency  later this decade to replace the existing
A320 line, the top seller at the Toulouse, France-based
planemaker and a competitor to the 737.  Airbus also announced plans at the Farnborough show near
London to increase the range of the A330 by 400 nautical miles
(741 kilometers).  To contact the reporters on this story:
