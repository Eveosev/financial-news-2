Ocean Power Technologies Inc. (OPTT) , a
builder of plants that produce electricity from the motion of
waves, surged the most ever after  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  agreed
to use its systems for a 19-megawatt plant in Australia.  Ocean Power rose 72 percent to $3.55 at the close in New
York, the biggest gain since the Pennington, New Jersey-based
company began trading on April 25, 2007.  The companies will jointly build the wave-power plant in
Victoria, Lockheed said in a statement today. They’ve been
collaborating on the technology since 2004.  Ocean Power won a grant of A$66.5 million ($68 million)
from Australia’s Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism for
the project. The company is also developing wave-energy projects
in Oregon, Hawaii, Spain and the U.K.  Wave energy has the potential to produce about 2,000
terawatt-hours of electricity a year, or enough power to meet 10
percent of the world’s current energy needs, Lockheed said in
the statement, citing the World Energy Council.  To contact the reporters on this story:
