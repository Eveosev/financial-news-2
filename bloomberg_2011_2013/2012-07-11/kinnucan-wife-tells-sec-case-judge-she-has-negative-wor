 The wife of John Kinnucan, the
Broadband Research LLC founder accused of  insider-trading , is
asking a federal judge to suspend a case filed by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, saying she has a negative
net worth.  Catherine Kinnucan, the wife of the jailed analyst, said in
a letter to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in  New York , who
is presiding over the SEC case, that she has “zero” income and
that there is “nothing for the SEC to recoup.”  John Kinnucan, who pleaded not guilty to the criminal
charges, was indicted Feb. 21, accused of passing inside tips to
hedge fund clients about  SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) ,  OmniVision Technologies
Inc. (OVTI)  and other companies. He “befriended” employees of public
technology companies, obtained nonpublic information from them
and passed it to his fund manager clients, prosecutors in the
office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara allege.  “John assured me he was exercising due diligence with
respect to operating his business in full compliance with all
applicable laws and regulations,” Catherine  Kinnucan said in
an April 24, 2012, letter to Nathan made public today.  “The SEC has assumed it can recoup a substantial amount of
ill gotten gains based upon the insider trading,” she wrote.
“In truth, the net worth of the Kinnucan household is negative
and I am struggling.”  John Kinnucan remains in custody in the federal jail in
 Brooklyn , New York, unable to raise $5 million bond.  To contact the reporter on this story:
