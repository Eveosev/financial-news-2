New York gasoline strengthened as
 PBF Energy Inc. (PBF)  reported emissions at its Delaware City refinery
in Delaware and East Coast inventories of the fuel declined.  The release at PBF’s 182,200-barrel-a-day refinery occurred
late yesterday, according to a filing with state regulators. The
plant also had a compressor fail July 5, and a compressor
tripped July 9, according to separate filings.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor rose 0.75 cent a gallon to 15.5 cents over futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:32 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It is the highest level
since June 26. Prompt delivery increased 2.33 cents to $2.9177.  Stockpiles of the fuel made to East Coast specifications
dropped 800,000 barrels to 14.6 million barrels last week,
Energy Department data showed.  Inventories  were down from 16
million barrels during the same period last year.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline on the
 Gulf Coast  gained 0.5 cent to a premium of 1.5 cents a gallon
versus futures.  Exxon Mobil Corp. flared gases at its refinery in Beaumont,
 Texas , after a unit shut down because of unplanned maintenance,
according to a filing with the National Response Center. The
release at 3:30 a.m. local time yesterday was secured, the
filing showed.  Kathleen Jackson, a spokeswoman for the company, didn’t
immediately return an e-mail seeking comment.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago  narrowed 0.25 cent to 13.25 cents a gallon versus
futures.  Husky Energy Inc.’s Lima, Ohio, refinery plans to shut its
selective catalytic reduction system for 10 days starting July
16 for maintenance, said Dina Pierce, a spokeswoman for the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
