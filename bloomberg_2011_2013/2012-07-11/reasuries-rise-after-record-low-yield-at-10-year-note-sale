Treasury  10-year note yields 
approached all-time lows after the U.S. sold $21 billion of the
securities at a record rate and minutes from the  Federal
Reserve ’s last meeting showed some members favor more stimulus.  The auction attracted record high demand from a group of
investors that include pension funds and insurance companies.
The notes drew a yield of 1.459 percent, compared with a
forecast of 1.518 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of seven of
the Fed’s 21 primary dealers. The previous record low auction
yield of 1.622 percent was set last month.  “There is a grab for high-quality paper internationally,”
said  Carl Lantz , head of interest-rate strategy in  New York  at
Credit Suisse AG, one of 21 primary dealers that bid at the
auction. “With things in  Europe  not getting better, and the
data in the U.S. softening, demand for Treasuries is high and
going to stay that way.”  The  yield  on the 10-year note rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.52 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It touched 1.45 percent
after setting a record low of 1.4387 percent on June 1. The 1.75
percent security due in May 2022 fell 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000
face amount, to 102 1/8.  A Bloomberg survey of economists projects the median yield
on the 10-year note will rise to 1.9 percent by year-end, down
0.2 percent from the previous survey. The low forecast is 1.4
percent and the high is 3.3 percent.  Demand ‘Suspicion’  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, at today’s
auction was 3.61, the highest since April 2010, compared with
3.06 percent in June and an average of 3.07 for the past 10
sales.  Direct bidders were awarded  45.4 percent  of the debt, the
most for any offering of U.S. government coupon securities on
record. The $9.53 billion purchased was $5.16 billion more than
at the previous offering on June 13. The previous record for
direct demand at a 10-year note sale was 31.7 percent at the
August 2011 auction.  “We don’t know and we won’t know” the source of that
demand, said  David Ader , head of U.S. government-bond strategy
at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Given the
sheer size, it’s unlikely a dozen people all decided to come in
and it just is coincidental. So the shadow of suspicion is cast
on a player or two.”  Since the start of 2012, direct bidders have won an average
21.1 percent of the debt sold at Treasury 10-year auctions. The
next highest direct demand has come at 30-year bond sales, with
an average award to direct bidders of 14.9 percent.  ‘Still Uncertainty’  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 40.6 percent of the securities at
today’s sale, compared with an average of 42.2 percent for the
past 10 offerings of 10-year notes.  Primary dealers won  14 percent  of the offering, the fewest
for the auction of any U.S. government coupon security on
record.  The U.S. will auction $13 billion of 30-year bonds tomorrow
after a $32 billion three-year note sale yesterday. That
offering drew a yield of 0.366 percent, compared with a forecast
of 0.383 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of seven primary
dealers.  Benchmark yields had climbed from a five-week low after the
 term premium , a model created by the Federal Reserve that
includes expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation,
showed Treasuries are the most expensive ever. The gauge fell to
a record negative 0.96 percent yesterday.  “There’s still uncertainty to come,” said  Sean Simko , who
manages $8 billion at  SEI Investments Co. (SEIC)  in Oaks,  Pennsylvania .
“There still remain headwinds, and slow economic growth is
driving the bid.”  Fed Minutes  A U.S. report on July 6 showed the economy added 80,000
jobs in June, less than the 100,000 projected by a Bloomberg
News survey of economists. The  unemployment rate  held steady at
8.2 percent.  A few Fed policy makers said the central bank will probably
need to take more action “to promote satisfactory growth in
employment and to ensure that the inflation rate would be at the
Committee’s goal,” according to the record of the  Federal Open
Market Committee ’s June 19-20 gathering released today in
 Washington .  Policy makers at that meeting extended by $267 billion the
Fed’s Operation Twist program, designed to put downward pressure
on long-term interest rates. The Fed bought $4.77 billion of
securities due from July 2018 to June 2019 today as part of the
program, with primary dealers submitting offers equaling 4.02
times the securities bought. The average ratio is 2.93 since the
central bank began the program in October 2011.  ‘More Aggressive’  The Fed has purchased $2.3 billion of mortgage and Treasury
debt in two separate rounds of quantitative easing, or QE.
Stocks fell today after a third round of asset purchases wasn’t
more strongly signaled.  “People thought they would be more aggressive,” said
 Michael Franzese , managing director and head of Treasury trading
at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in New York. “We knew there was
going to be the need for more stimulus, but they haven’t said
it’s coming out anytime soon.”  Investors have poured into the world’s safest government
securities amid Europe’s debt crisis.  Germany ’s borrowing costs
dropped to the least on record today at a sale of 4.15 billion
euros ($5.1 billion) of 10-year debt. The nation sold the
securities at a yield of 1.31 percent, down from 1.52 percent at
a June 13 sale, according to a statement from the Bundesbank.  Gross’s View  Ten-year  U.S. debt  has returned 5 percent this year, double
the 2.5 percent gain in the broader Treasury market. The notes
returned 17 percent in 2011, compared with a 9.8 percent gain by
Treasuries overall, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes.  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., held holdings of Treasuries
and mortgages steady in June after saying that U.S. securities
are still the safest bet.  “Don’t underweight  Uncle Sam  in a debt crisis,” Gross
wrote in his monthly investment outlook posted on the  Newport
Beach , California-based company’s website on June 28. “Money
seeking a safe haven will find it in America’s deep and liquid,
almost Aaa rated, bond and equity markets.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
