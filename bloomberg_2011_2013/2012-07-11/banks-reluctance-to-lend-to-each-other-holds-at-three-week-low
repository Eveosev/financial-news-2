European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another held at the lowest in more than three weeks,
according to a money market indicator.  The Euribor OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was little
changed at 39 basis points at 8:20 a.m. in  London , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure is the lowest since June
8 after it dropped nine basis points on July 5 when the  European
Central Bank  cut its benchmark rates.  A decline signals banks are more willing to lend. Euribor
is the rate  banks  say they see each other lending in euros and
is derived from a survey by the European Banking Federation.
Three-month Euribor fell to a record yesterday at 0.521 percent
from 0.531 the day before.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars fell to
the lowest since June 22. The three-month cross-currency  basis
swap , the rate banks pay to convert euro interest payments into
dollars, was 54.5 basis points below the euro interbank offered
rate from minus 57.5 basis points yesterday.  The one-year basis swap was 55 basis points below Euribor
from minus 56 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
The Eonia OIS swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing
costs over the next three months, was little changed at 13 basis
points.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the ECB yesterday,
placing 809 billion euros ($992 billion) with the Frankfurt-
based central bank from 791 billion euros on July 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
