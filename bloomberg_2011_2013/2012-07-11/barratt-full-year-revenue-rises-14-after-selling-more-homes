Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV) , the
largest U.K. homebuilder by volume, said full-year revenue rose
about 14 percent as the company sold more homes at higher
prices.  Sales in the 12 months through June increased to about 2.32
billion pounds ($3.6 billion), the London-based company said
today in a statement. Completions rose 14 percent to 12,637
homes and the average selling price climbed 1 percent to about
180,000 pounds.  “Given a stable market, we would expect our strong
progress to continue,” Finance Director  David Thomas  said on a
conference call. Uncertainty surrounding the economy and the
housing market is continuing, “primarily as a result of
constraints around mortgage availability,” he said.  British homebuilders have increased revenue amid restrained
mortgage lending and little change in home values after focusing
on wider margins. The company’s full-year operating margin rose
to around 8.2 percent from 6.6 percent, according to the
statement. That’s likely to increase to more than 10 percent
next year, Thomas said.  Barratt has risen 43 percent this year compared with 21
percent gain in the  Bloomberg EMEA Home Builders Index. (BEUHBLD)  The
shares were down 3 percent, or 4.1 pence, to 133 pence as of the
4:30 p.m. close in  London  trading, giving the company a market
value of 1.3 billion pounds.  ‘Higher Margin’  “Higher-margin land will continue to be brought into
production and our focus on sales prices, cost and debt
reduction will continue,” Thomas said on the call.  Net debt was about 170 million pounds as of June 30
compared with 322.6 million pounds a year earlier, the company
said in the statement. Total forward sales decreased 6 percent
to 555.4 million pounds, while the cancellation rate declined to
18.5 percent from 20.6 percent.  Growth in the number completions is likely to decelerate
while mortgage lending in Britain remains limited, according to
Thomas. U.K. mortgage approvals fell in May as the housing
market slowed amid concern over the economic outlook, the  Bank
of England  said July 3.  “There is good underlying demand in terms of the housing
market,” Thomas said. “That demand has to be enabled by
further availability in terms of mortgages.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
