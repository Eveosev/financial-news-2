U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
told his  Conservative Party ’s lawmakers that he would make one
more attempt in the coming weeks to push his bill introducing
elections to the House of Lords after a Tory mutiny yesterday.  At a private meeting for Conservatives in Parliament,
Cameron addressed the rebellion, which saw almost a third of
them voting against his government’s plans. A lawmaker who was
present today in  London  and declined to be identified described
the event to journalists afterward.  Cameron had to drop a move to speed the legislation through
Parliament last night in the face of opposition from his own
side. His coalition allies, the Liberal Democrats, have
threatened to block other parts of his program if his lawmakers
continue to oppose the Lords plan.  The prime minister is likely to offer the  Liberal Democrats 
a compromise, with elections for some members of the Lords in
2015, members of the hereditary nobility removed, and any
further moves postponed until after the election, according to a
person familiar with his plans. Cameron told the meeting he
hoped to achieve a small elected element to the chamber.  George Young, the minister in charge of Parliamentary
business, will set out some detail of the timetable for the
legislation tomorrow morning.  To contact the reporters on this story:
