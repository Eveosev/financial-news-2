China ’s  passenger-vehicle sales  rose
in June, exceeding analysts’ estimates for a fourth consecutive
month after automakers increased shipments ahead of scheduled
shutdowns for the summer.  Wholesale deliveries, including multipurpose and sport
utility vehicles, gained 16 percent to 1.28 million units last
month, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said in
a statement today. That compares with the 1.27 million average
estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  led sales gains in
China as Japanese carmakers rebounded from last year’s
earthquake disruptions. Auto manufacturers may have delivered
more vehicles to dealerships to meet sales targets for the half-
year period, according to  UBS AG. (UBSN)  Last month’s growth may also
reflect increased shipments before traditional factory closures
in July and August for maintenance, CSC International Holdings
said.  “Carmakers typically shut factories for a period in summer
for routine maintenance and are boosting dealership stockpiles
before it,” said Han Weiqi, a Shanghai-based analyst at CSC
International Holdings Ltd. “This comes at the cost of bigger
inventory pressure at dealerships.”  In the first six months, passenger-vehicle deliveries
gained 7.1 percent to 7.61 million units, the association said.  Total vehicle sales , including trucks and buses, increased
9.9 percent to 1.58 million units in June. Sport-utility vehicle
deliveries gained 52 percent, the best-performing segment.  Guangzhou Curbs  Growth may slow in Guangzhou, the capital of  Guangdong
province  that borders Hong Kong, after the southern Chinese city
of imposed a quota on new vehicle registrations this month to
control vehicle emissions and ease traffic congestion.  Guangzhou -- which followed Beijing, Shanghai and Guiyang
in implementing curbs on vehicles -- may not be last.  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  said in a July 2 report that 11 other cities, accounting
for 15 percent of total industry sales in 2010, are candidates
to also implement limits on cars.  The slowing economy may also be undermining the outlook.
Chinese second-quarter economic growth, due to be released July
13, may have slid to 7.7 percent from a year earlier, according
to the median of 33 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
as of July 6. The economy expanded 8.1 percent in the first
three months, the fifth quarterly slowdown.  In the first five months, passenger-car sales increased 5.5
percent to 6.33 million units after growth of 6.1 percent a year
earlier. Figures for April, May and June last year were hurt by
disruption from the  Japan  earthquake.  GM Gains  General Motors Co. (GM) , China’s largest foreign automaker,
boosted vehicle sales 10 percent to 213,495 units, led by demand
for its Buick sedans and Wuling minivans, the company said in a
statement July 5. Demand from consumers in China’s interior
provinces will help sales growth remain steady in the second
half of the year,  Kevin Wale , GM’s China head said.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  raised total vehicle sales in China by 18
percent to 52,440 units. First-half deliveries gained 1 percent.
BYD, the Chinese carmaker partly owned by  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) , sold 12 percent fewer cars in the first five months,
according to industry analyst LMC Automotive.  Honda increased deliveries 84 percent to 64,652 units, with
sales and production a year earlier disrupted by the earthquake
and tsunami in Japan. Toyota sold 70,500 units in June, 19
percent more than a year earlier.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s China demand gained 10 percent to
119,200.  Among luxury carmakers, Volkswagen’s Audi boosted sales 20
percent last month to 33,309 units. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG
increased deliveries 13 percent to 23,930 on the mainland, which
excludes  Hong Kong . Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz sales in June
climbed 2 percent to 17,250 units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
