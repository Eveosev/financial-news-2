The eastern U.S. from the Midwest to
the Northeast may swelter next week as another round of
temperatures in the 90s Fahrenheit (30s Celsius) raises energy
use by as much as 30 percent and dries crops.  Temperatures along the East Coast may be 5 degrees above
normal while reaching 8 degrees higher in the Midwest, including
 Chicago , from July 16-20, according to Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  “The heat indexes can get up into the 100s” because the
higher temperatures will be accompanied by higher humidity, CWG
President  Matt Rogers  said in a telephone interview. “It’s
going to be a strong demand period, that’s for sure.”  More than 6,000 high temperature records have been broken
or tied in the U.S. since June 1, the start of summer for
meteorologists, while natural gas futures advanced 13 percent
from June 1 through yesterday amid increased demand for fuel to
run air conditioners. Natural gas is used to produce about 32
percent of U.S. power.  From Chicago to  New York , residents may need at least 30
percent more energy to cool down next week, said  David Salmon ,
owner of Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri . Parts of
upstate New York may use 80 percent more.  Gas Burn  Electricity generators will burn gas at an average rate of
25.22 billion cubic feet a day this year, 21 percent more than
in 2011, the Energy Department said yesterday in its Short-Term
Energy Outlook.  August-delivery natural gas rose as much as 2.7 percent on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  today on forecasts for hot
weather through July 25.  In June, 3,282 daily high temperature records were set or
tied across the U.S., according to the  National Climatic Data
Center . So far this month, 2,761 records have been broken or
tied, according to the center in Asheville,  North Carolina .  In addition, the heat and dryness have sent at least 56
percent of the U.S. into drought conditions, the center said.  The U.S. Agriculture Department has cut production and
inventory estimates for corn and soy beans because of the
continuing drought.  Prices for corn, the largest U.S. crop, surged 42 percent
from mid-June through yesterday as areas of moderate to extreme
drought expanded to 53 percent of the Midwest.  Crop conditions 
as of July 8 were the worst for that date since the drought of
1988, government data show.  Drought Impact  The drought will help keep temperatures high because dry
ground allows for “enhanced solar heating,” said  Jim Rouiller ,
senior energy meteorologist for Planalytics Inc. in Berwyn,
 Pennsylvania . “There’s an old term, ‘drought begets drought’
that’s going to hold this year.”  The temperature has hit 90 or higher in New York’s Central
Park 11 times since June 20, while the 2002 to 2011 yearly
average was 15.9, the  National Weather Service  said. The high
reached 90 five times in June, the most since six days in 1999.  Central Park is forecast to reach 90 again tomorrow,
according to the weather service. Chicago is forecast to have a
high of 87 tomorrow.  The normal average temperature in New York on July 13 is 78
degrees, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,
 Maryland . Its 74 in  Boston ; 80 in Washington; 80 in Atlanta; 75
in Chicago; 85 in Houston; 66 in Seattle and 75 in Burbank,
California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
