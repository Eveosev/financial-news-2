Zack Greinke of the  Milwaukee
Brewers  will become the first pitcher to start three straight
games in the same season since Red Faber in 1917, thanks to an
ejection and Major League Baseball’s All-Star Game.  Greinke, 28, is scheduled to pitch the Brewers’ first game
after the four-day All-Star break, on July 13 against the
Pittsburgh Pirates. He also started Milwaukee’s previous two
games, throwing only four pitches in a July 7 game in Houston
before getting thrown out and then coming back to pitch three
innings the following day against the Astros.  “I’m considering it a record,” Greinke told the
 Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel .  Faber, a Hall of Fame pitcher who won 254 games over 20
major-league seasons, made three consecutive starts for the
 Chicago White Sox  in September of the 1917 season, according to
the Elias Sports Bureau.  Greinke, who won the American League Cy Young Award with
the  Kansas City Royals  in 2009, has a 9-3 record with a 3.32
earned run average in 19 starts for the Brewers this season.  He was ejected from his July 7 start by umpire Sam Holbrook
after spiking a baseball into the ground in dispute of a ruling
on a close play at first base. Greinke threw 66 pitches the next
day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
