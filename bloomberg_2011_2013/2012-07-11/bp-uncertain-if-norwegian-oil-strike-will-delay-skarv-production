BP Plc said it did not yet know
whether a 16-day strike by Norwegian oil workers would delay a
planned fourth-quarter production start at its Skarv field in
the  Norwegian Sea .  “It’s too early to say,” BP spokesman Olav Fjellsaa said
by mobile phone today. “We won’t be up and going before two or
three days.”  The strike, which was ended yesterday when Norway’s
government ordered a compulsory arbitration, led to a shutdown
of preparations for production at Skarv, he said.  BP operates the field with a 23.8 percent stake, while
 Statoil ASA (STL) , Norway’s biggest producer, controls 36.2 percent.
Estimated recoverable reserves are 409 million barrels of oil
equivalent, of which three quarters are gas, according to BP’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
