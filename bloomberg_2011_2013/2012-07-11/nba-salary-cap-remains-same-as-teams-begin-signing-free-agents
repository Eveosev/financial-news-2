The  National Basketball Association 
kept the salary cap for teams at $58.04 million for the next
season as the moratorium was lifted at midnight to allow clubs
to sign free agents.  The tax level also was unchanged at $70.31 million, meaning
that a team must pay $1 in tax for every $1 its salaries exceed
that figure.  The minimum team salary, which is set at 85 percent of the
salary cap, is $49.34 million for the 2012-13 season.  The teams were given the go-ahead to begin signing players
to contracts at 12:01 a.m. today. If a free agent signs with
another team, his home team is given three days to make an offer.  The collective bargaining agreement provides for three
different mid-level exceptions for signing players depending on
a teamâ€™s salary level.  If a team is over the cap and under the tax level, it can
use the non-taxpayer mid-level exemption of $5 million. If it
exceeds the tax limit, the team can use the taxpayer mid-level
exemption of $3.09 million. The mid-level exemption for a team
with room under the salary cap is $2.58 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
