The U.S. cut its corn-harvest
estimate 12 percent and said inventories next year will be
smaller than forecast in June as the worst Midwest drought since
1988 erodes prospects for a record crop.  Farmers will harvest 12.97 billion bushels (329.45 million
metric tons), down from a June prediction of 14.79 billion, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report . Analysts
expected 13.534 billion, based on the average of 14 estimates in
a Bloomberg survey. Inventories before the 2013 harvest may be
1.183 billion bushels, down 37 percent from 1.881 billion
forecast last month, the USDA said.  Corn prices through yesterday surged 42 percent since mid-
June on the  Chicago  Board of Trade as areas of moderate to
extreme drought expanded to 53 percent of the Midwest. Crop
conditions as of July 8 were the worst for that date since the
drought of 1988, government data show. Tighter supplies than
expected may boost costs for ethanol makers including  Archer
Daniels Midland Co. (ADM)  and meat producer  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD)   “The drought of 2012 will be one for the records,” said
 Peter Meyer , the senior director for agricultural commodities at
PIRA Energy Group in  New York , who forecasts a drop in output to
11 billion bushels if the hot, dry spell lasts another three
weeks. “Whether it’s ethanol or livestock, no one is immune
from this impending disaster. The ramifications will be
widespread, affecting everything from your food to your
gasoline.”  Corn Futures  Corn futures for December delivery rose 3.3 percent to
$7.4125 a bushel at 7:49 a.m. in Chicago, after touching $7.48,
the highest for the most-active contract since Sept. 13.  Reserve supplies  in the U.S., the world’s largest grower
and exporter, on Aug. 31, 2013, will be below the 1.216 billion
expected on average from 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Prices have rallied in the past week as a record heat wave
blanketed the Midwest just as 50 percent of the crop was trying
to pollinate. About 40 percent of the crop was in good or
excellent condition as of July 8, down from 77 percent on May
18, government data show.  Yields near Decatur, Illinois-based Archer Daniels Midland,
the biggest corn processor, already are expected to be 20
percent smaller than the five-year average of 175 bushels an
acre, said Scott Docherty, the general manager at Topflight
Grain Cooperative based in Monticello,  Illinois . Yields in the
region may dip to 115 bushels an acre if the dry weather
continues into August, he said.  Yields Cut  Farmers may harvest 88.9 million acres of corn this year,
compared with 84.0 million in 2011, the USDA said. National
yields will average 146 bushels an acre this year, down from a
record 166 bushels estimated in June, according to the
government, which will release its first survey-based crop
estimate on Aug. 10.  “We had a great start, but last week’s heat really damaged
the crops,” said Docherty, who manages 10 grain terminals in an
area that covers about 200,000 acres of prime Midwest farmland.
“Some farmers are not going to harvest one bushel this year.
It’s very disappointing.”  World output in the crop year that begins Oct. 1 will be
905.23 million tons, down from 949.93 million forecast in June,
the USDA said. World production last year was 873.7 million.  Global inventories on Oct. 1, 2013, will total 134.09
million tons, down from 155.74 million forecast in June and
129.37 million projected for the end of this marketing year, the
USDA said. Analysts were expecting 143.8 million tons.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, with a 2011 value of $76.5
billion, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
