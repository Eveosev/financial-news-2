Bamburi Cement Co., (BMBC)  Kenya’s biggest
maker of the building materials, jumped to its highest level in
almost 11 months on speculation earnings increased in the first
half of the year.  The shares rose 3 percent to 170 shillings by 1:45 p.m. in
Nairobi. A close at this level would be the highest since Aug.
16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nairobi’s All Share
Index slipped less than 0.1 percent today.  “There are expectations first-half results will be good,”
Vimal Parmar, head of research at Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital
East Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today. Profit before
tax was probably 4.5 billion shillings ($53.6 million) in the
period, compared with 4.26 billion shillings a year earlier, he
said.  The building and construction industry expanded 3.2 percent
in the first quarter of this year, according to data from the
