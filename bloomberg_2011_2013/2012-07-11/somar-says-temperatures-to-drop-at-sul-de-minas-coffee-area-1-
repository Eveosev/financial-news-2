Coffee growing areas in the southern
part of  Minas Gerais , Brazilâ€™s biggest Arabica-producing state,
will escape frost when temperatures fall, according to
forecaster Somar Meteorologia.  Temperatures will drop to 1 degree Celsius (34 degrees
Fahrenheit) in Pocos de Caldas and Pouso Alegre at dawn on July
15 in the region known as Sul de Minas, Marco Antonio dos Santos, an agronomist at the company in Sao Paulo, said today by
phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
