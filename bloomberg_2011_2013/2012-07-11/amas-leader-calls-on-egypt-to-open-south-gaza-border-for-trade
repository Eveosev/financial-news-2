Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh called
on  Egypt  to open its border with the  Gaza Strip  for commercial
trade, providing a conduit for imports and exports outside the
hundreds of smuggling tunnels dug under the frontier.  Haniyeh’s appeal, outlined to reporters today in Gaza City,
follows a doubling in permits for Palestinians to cross into
Egypt at the southern Rafah border station to about 1,500 a day
since the election of Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi.  Rafah is Gaza’s only official border crossing to Egypt that
bypasses  Israel . Haniyeh said the station should be open 24
hours a day with free movement of commercial goods to help
revive the struggling Palestinian economy.  Israel and Egypt sealed Gaza’s borders in June 2007 after
Hamas broke off its power-sharing arrangement with Palestinian
Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas . Hamas is an offshoot of
Mursi’s Muslim Brotherhood organization. The group is considered
a terrorist organization by Israel, the U.S. and European Union.  Egyptian presidential spokesman Yasser Ali’s mobile phone
was switched off when contacted by Bloomberg for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
