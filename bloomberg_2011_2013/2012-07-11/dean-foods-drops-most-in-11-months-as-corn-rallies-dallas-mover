Dean Foods Co. (DF) , the largest U.S.
dairy processor, tumbled the most in eight months after the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  reduced its production estimate for
raw milk and raised its price forecast.  Dean  fell  6.6 percent to $14.99 in  New York , the biggest
drop since Nov. 9.  U.S. raw-milk production this year and next will be lower
than a June forecast and prices will be higher as a drought in
the U.S. Midwest increases the cost of  animal feed  and
encourages “a more rapid decline in the cow herd,” the  USDA 
said.  The share-price decline “is certainly related to the
movement in corn and how people are linking that to increasing
milk prices,” Amit Sharma, a New York-based analyst for BMO
Capital Markets who rates the shares a buy, said today in a
telephone interview. “We will not be in a declining milk price
environment.”  Dean’s  Fresh-Dairy Direct unit , which processes raw milk
into products for its own brands and for other labels, is the
company’s largest by sales. Rising raw-milk prices indicate
higher costs for dairy processors such as Dean, Akshay Jagdale,
a New York-based analyst for KeyBanc Capital Markets, said in a
telephone interview.  Corn futures in  Chicago  touched $7.48 a bushel today, the
highest for the most-active contract since Sept. 13, after the
USDA cut its domestic production estimate by 12 percent one
month after predicting a record harvest. The U.S. is the world’s
largest corn grower and exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
