French President  Francois Hollande ’s
approval rating fell to 56 percent this month from 63 percent in
a previous poll conducted in May and June, according to a survey
by IFOP for Paris Match.  Sixty-eight percent of respondents said Hollande was close
to the concerns of the French, down from 77 percent in the
earlier survey, while 53 percent said his policies were
efficient in coping with debt and the public deficit, down from
59 percent previously.  Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault’s approval rating fell to
63 percent from 68 percent, according to the poll released
today.  The poll was based on telephone interviews conducted with
1,005 people aged 18 or older July 5 to July 6 and has a margin
of error of about 1.8 percent, according to the study released
by IFOP and the magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
