Mauritius expects foreign direct
investment to rise to 10 billion rupees ($320 million) by the
end of the year,  Board of Investment  Chairman Maurice Lam said.  Investment for the first half of 2012 was probably “3
billion rupees to 3.5 billion rupees,” Lam said in a transcript
of an interview published in the Port Louis-based Business
Magazine today. FDI for 2011 was 9.46 billion rupees, according
to Bank of Mauritius  data .  The Indian Ocean island nation should diversify its
investment sources to countries such as Japan and  South Korea 
from Europe, its traditional market, Lam said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
