AU Optronics Corp. (2409) ,  LG Display Co. (066570) 
and  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  agreed to pay $543.5 million to resolve
allegations they conspired to fix prices of flat-screen panels
used in TVs and computer monitors.  Money from the settlement will be available to consumers in
24 states who overpaid for electronics because of the alleged
price-fixing, said San Francisco attorney  Joseph Alioto , co-lead
counsel representing screen purchasers suing the companies.  The manufacturers will also pay $27.5 million in civil
penalties to eight states, bringing the total to $571 million,
he said without specifying how much each will pay. The companies
confirmed a settlement agreement was reached.  “That’s what they agreed to, that’s what we’ve agreed
to,” Alioto said yesterday in a phone interview. A court filing
seeking approval of the settlement will be filed today in
federal court in San Francisco, he said.  Toshiba will pay $21 million if the settlement is approved
by the court, Keisuke Oomori, a spokesman for the Tokyo-based
company, said by phone today.  “Toshiba denies any wrongdoing on its part in the LCD
business, and we entered settlement to avoid further expense and
the distraction of protracted litigation,” Oomori said.  AU Optronics has already made sufficient provisions for the
settlement and expects no material impact on its operations or
finances, the Hsinchu, Taiwan-based company said in an exchange
 filing  today. Claire Ohm, a spokeswoman for Seoul-based  LG
Display (034220) , confirmed that a settlement had been reached and
declined further comment in an e-mail.  Record Recovery  Combined with an earlier settlement with other panel makers
for $538.5 million, approved yesterday by a federal judge, the
cash settlement of more than $1 billion sets a record for
recovery in a class action, or group, lawsuit over price-fixing,
Alioto said.  A U.S. Justice Department investigation that led to guilty
pleas by LG Display,  Chunghwa Picture Tubes (2475)  Ltd. and  Sharp Corp. (6753) 
preceded civil lawsuits filed in federal court in San Francisco.
The companies agreed in 2008 and 2009 to pay $585 million in
criminal fines, the U.S. said.  The companies are alleged to have fixed prices for the
screens, driving up prices from 1999 to 2006, according to the
class-action lawsuit filed in 2007.  The case is In RE TFT-LCD Antitrust Litigation, 07-01827,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of  California  (San
Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
