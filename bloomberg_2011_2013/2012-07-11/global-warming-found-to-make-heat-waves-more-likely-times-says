Global warming made the heat wave
that hit  Texas  last year 20 times more likely than it would have
been in the 1960s, the  New York  Times reported, citing a study
by the Climate Change Research Institute at  Oregon State
University .  That’s among weather extremes that have become more likely
because of human-induced global warming, the newspaper said,
citing Philip Mote, director of the institute. The very warm
temperatures in the U.K. last November were more than 60 times
as likely because of global warming, the report said.  Heat waves and a rise in droughts and downpours may worsen
because of global warming, according to the report, which added
the heavy rainfall in Thailand in 2011 wasn’t especially unusual
based on records.  The Arctic warmed more quickly than the planet last year
and sea ice in the region was at the second-lowest level on
record, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
