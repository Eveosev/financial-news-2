Dogusan Boru Sanayii & Ticaret AS (DOGUB) , a
maker of cement pipes and fittings, fell to the lowest level in
six weeks after  Turkey â€™s asset sales agency canceled the
divestment of a 56 percent state-held stake in the company.  Dogusan dropped 6.1 percent to 1.38 liras at the close in
Istanbul, the lowest level since May 30. The stock earlier lost
as much as 10 percent and is up 24 percent this year.  The agency in Ankara annulled a July 2011 auction to sell
Dogusan after the fourth and final bidder declined to sign an
agreement to buy the company, it said in a statement to the
 Istanbul Stock Exchange  after the market closed yesterday.  A previous auction to sell the Dogusan stake was also
canceled in May 2010 after no bids were received.  To contact the reporter on this story:
