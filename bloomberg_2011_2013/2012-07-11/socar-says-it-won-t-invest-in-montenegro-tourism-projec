State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan , or
Socar, denied a report that it’s going to invest in a tourism
project in Montenegro.  “Socar has no plans to enter the hotel business,” company
President Rovnaq Abdullayev told reporters in the Azeri capital
Baku today.  Montenegro’s Council for Privatization and Capital Projects
said in an e-mail on July 5 that Socar was chosen to turn a
former military site in the Balkan country into a holiday resort
for 258 million euros ($317 million).  Abdullayev said Azerbaijan’s tourism companies will carry
out the project and Socar will only provide them with
“organizational and legal” help.  To contact the reporter on this story:
