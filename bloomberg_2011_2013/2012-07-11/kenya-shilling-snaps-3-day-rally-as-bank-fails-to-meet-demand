Kenya ’s shilling snapped a three-day
rally as the central bank failed to meet demand for repurchase
agreements and term-auction deposits.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy depreciated
less than 0.1 percent to close at 83.75 per dollar, having
traded 0.6 percent weaker at 84.20 earlier.  “The shilling has weakened on account of increase in
liquidity as the central bank’s payment for matured securities
is higher than the amount its sucking from the market through
repurchase agreements and term-auction deposits,” Jeremiah
Kendagor, head of trading at Nairobi-based  Kenya Commercial Bank
Ltd. (KNCB) , said in a phone interview.  The bank sold today 1.5 billion shillings ($18 million) of
seven-day repos at a weighted average rate of 14.85 percent,
said an official, who asked not to be identified in line with
policy. It also accepted 1.5 billion shillings of bids for 28-
day deposits at 14.95 percent, the official said by telephone
from Nairobi. The bank received total bids of 5.47 billion
shillings, having offered 3 billion shillings for both
securities.  The Tanzanian shilling weakened less than 0.1 percent to
1,586 per dollar, while the Ugandan shilling depreciated 0.3
percent to 2,474 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
