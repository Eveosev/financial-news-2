Harald Gegenwart,  Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s
head of German equity trading, was among those dismissed as the
lender cuts jobs amid a slowdown in  Europe , according to two
people with direct knowledge of the decision.  The dismissal of Gegenwart and the trader he supervised was
part of broader reductions across Europe, and trading of
regional German stocks will be picked up by other groups, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the cuts
weren’t public. A call for comment to Gegenwart today was
answered by someone who said he wasn’t in the office.  Morgan Stanley is eliminating fewer than 100 jobs as
trading and deal volume fall amid the European sovereign-debt
crisis, people briefed on the plans said this week. The cuts
will come primarily from the trading business in Europe and
Asia, said the people, who requested anonymity because the plans
aren’t public.  At least seven euro economies already are in recession and
 Germany , Europe’s largest, which helped the single-currency zone
avert a contraction in the first quarter, also is cooling.
German investor confidence dropped the most in 14 years in June,
and executives grew more pessimistic. Euro-area economic
sentiment slumped to the lowest in more than 2 1/2 years last
month, while unemployment reached a record 11.1 percent in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
