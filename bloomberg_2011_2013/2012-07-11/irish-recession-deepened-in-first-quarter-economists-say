Ireland’s economy may have
contracted for a third consecutive quarter in the first three
months of the year, as consumers held back on spending and the
euro-region debt crisis curbed export growth.  Gross domestic product  may have fallen by 0.4 percent in
the first quarter from the previous three months, according to
the median estimate of eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The economy shrank 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter. The
figures from the  Central Statistics Office , which may include
revisions of earlier numbers, will be released at 11 a.m.
tomorrow in Dublin.  Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  forecast in April the
economy would expand by 0.7 percent this year after it returned
to growth on a full-year basis for the first time in four years
in 2011. Yet the weakest patch in global growth since the end of
the 2009 recession is threatening Ireland’s export-led recovery,
and Irish unemployment has risen to the highest level since
1994.  “First quarter data will most likely show the economy
falling again, and that the government’s forecast is out of
reach,” said  Michael Saunders , an economist at Citigroup Inc.
in  London , who estimates the economy may have shrunk by 0.7
percent in the first quarter. “It is not because of any
failings of the Irish government but the weakness of the euro
area economy and the U.K. economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
