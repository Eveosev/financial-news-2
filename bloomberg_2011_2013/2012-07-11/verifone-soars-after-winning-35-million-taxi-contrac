  VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY) , the largest
maker of credit-card terminals, gained the most in more than two
years after announcing a contract for at least $35 million to
install payment systems in 6,500 cabs in  Washington .  VeriFone  advanced  11 percent to $35.41 at the close in New
York, for the biggest jump since May 2010. Through yesterday,
the San Jose-based company’s stock had fallen 10 percent this
year.  The five-year contract, which will see VeriFone also
provide electronic trip reporting, news display and other
programming in cabs in Washington, will increase the company’s
“taxi-media” presence to more than 35,000 vehicles across the
U.S., according to a statement today. With potential advertising
revenue, the deal could be worth as much as $45 million, the
company said.  “The District’s state of the art system represents the
expertise VeriFone has developed in providing integrated secure
payment and digital content solutions, which we call PAYMEDIA,
for taxis and other market segments,” Amos Tamam, VeriFone
senior vice president, Taxi Systems, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
