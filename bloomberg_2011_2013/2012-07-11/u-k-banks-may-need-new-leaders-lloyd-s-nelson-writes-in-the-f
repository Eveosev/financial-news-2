Britain’s banking industry needs
“fundamental reforms” in its governance,  John Nelson , chairman
of Lloyd’s of  London , wrote in the Financial Times.  “The single most effective way to change the culture of
any organization is to change people to those who ‘get’ the
necessity of cultural change,” Nelson wrote, adding that “too
many of the banking top brass have shown an appetite to cling on
to the old days.”  Straitened times call for a model in which “we tie
performance to longer-term incentives and sustainable profits,”
while the principle of capitalism is undermined by “the mega
remuneration endemic in the banks,” the insurance market’s
chairman wrote.  “The City shouldn’t be offering any ‘get-rich-quick
schemes’ to the bright young men and women who leave our top
universities looking for a pot of gold,” he wrote.  “Banks need to refocus on the customer” in an industry
that is vital to the economy, providing the essential function
of “intermediation of capital and risk,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
