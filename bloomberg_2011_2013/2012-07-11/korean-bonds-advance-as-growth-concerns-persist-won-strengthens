South Korea ’s government bonds
advanced as the euro-area finance ministers meeting and U.S.
employment data failed to ease concern the global economy is
slowing. The won reversed an earlier loss.  Euro-region finance chiefs agreed yesterday to make
available 30 billion euros ($37 billion) by the end of this
month to shore up  Spain ’s banks. Job openings in the U.S.
increased in May after plunging the prior month, figures showed
yesterday. South Korea’s jobless  rate  was at 3.2 percent in June,
unchanged from a four-month low in May, official figures showed
today. The  Bank of Korea  will hold the benchmark  rate  at 3.25
percent for a 13th month tomorrow, according to 14 out of 16
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Two forecast a 25 basis
point cut.  “Although we hear some positive news from  Europe , the
focus in the market has now moved to growth concerns and the
economy data we see isn’t enough to lift sentiment,” said Moon Hong Cheol, a Seoul-based fixed income analyst at Dongbu
Securities Co. “Expectations for a rate cut by the BOK tomorrow
have weakened, but bonds will be supported if the governor says
the decision wasn’t unanimous or gives negative views about the
economy.”  The yield on 3.25 percent bonds due June 2015 slid two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.20 percent at the
close in Seoul, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. That’s the
lowest for the  benchmark  bond since December 2010. Three-year
debt futures advanced 0.11 to 105.06 and the one-year interest-
rate swap declined one basis point to 3.25 percent, the lowest
since January 2011.  Won Rises  The won strengthened for the first time in four days,
gaining 0.3 percent to 1,140.90 per dollar. It reversed an
earlier loss on speculation South Korean exporters are selling
the greenback and as some investors stopped their long position
on the dollar, according to Han Sung Min, a Seoul-based currency
trader for Busan Bank. A long position is a bet an asset will
rise in value.  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped seven basis
points to 7.47 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
