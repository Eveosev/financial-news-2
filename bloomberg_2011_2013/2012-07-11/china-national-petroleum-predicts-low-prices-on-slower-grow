China  National Petroleum Corp., the
nation’s biggest oil company, expects economic growth to slow in
the second half, keeping prices depressed.  Costs will be controlled and steps will be taken to improve
fund-raising to cope with the situation, the state-controlled
company, known as CNPC, said in a  statement  posted on its
website today, without giving a specific price forecast. Company
officials met yesterday in Beijing to review first-half
operations and discuss strategies for the second half.  China, the world’s second-biggest oil consumer, today
reduced fuel prices for the third time since May, further
squeezing refining margins of CNPC and China Petrochemical Corp.
The government may say this week gross domestic product in the
second quarter expanded at the slowest pace since 2009,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  CNPC must seek “progress among all the risks and
uncertainties” to achieve production goals set at the beginning
of the year, the statement said. Natural gas sales were better
than expected in the first half and oil-product sales failed to
increase as much as in the “peak seasons,” the statement said,
without elaborating.  Overseas oil and gas production rose 3.5 percent from a
year earlier to 50.52 million tons, CNPC, the parent of  Hong
Kong  and Shanghai-listed PetroChina Co., said in an online
newsletter on July 9.  To contact the reporters on this story:
