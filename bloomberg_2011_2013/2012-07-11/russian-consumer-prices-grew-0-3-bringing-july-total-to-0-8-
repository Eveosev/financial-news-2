Russian consumer prices rose 0.3
percent in the week through July 9 as prices for utilities,
produce and vodka advanced, the Federal Statistics Service said.  The increase brought inflation in the month so far to 0.8
percent, compared with 0.1 percent in the same period a year
earlier, the Moscow-based service said in an e-mailed statement
today. Year-to-date price growth was 4 percent, compared with
5.1 percent in the same period of 2011, the service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
