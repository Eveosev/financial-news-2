The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission may require exchanges and self-regulatory
organizations to create a market-wide system to monitor and
analyze trading activity under a measure being considered today.  SEC commissioners are scheduled to vote on a final rule to
create the so-called consolidated audit trail at a meeting in
 Washington . National exchanges and SROs would be required to
submit comprehensive plans detailing how they would develop,
implement and maintain trails to collect and identify every
order, cancellation, modification and trade execution for all
listed equities and equity options, the SEC said in a fact sheet
prepared for the meeting.  “In today’s competitive marketplace, trading is dispersed
across a variety of market centers ranging from public venues,
to private dark pools, to individual broker-dealers,” SEC
Chairman  Mary Schapiro  said in a statement prepared for the
meeting. “A consolidated audit trail that accurately tracks
orders throughout their lifecycle and identifies the broker
dealers handling them will provide us with an unprecedented
ability to monitor the markets we regulate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
