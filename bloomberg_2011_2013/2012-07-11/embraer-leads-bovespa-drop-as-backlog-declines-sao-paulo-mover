Embraer SA (EMBR3)  was poised for its
biggest retreat in 11 months after the Brazilian aircraft maker
said its backlog of orders slumped in the second quarter.  Embraer lost 5.6 percent to 12.08 reais at 12:01 p.m. in
Sao Paulo, the steepest tumble since Aug. 8 on a closing basis.
The retreat was the biggest among members of the Bovespa index,
which fell 0.2 percent.  The manufacturer said late yesterday that the value of
orders it has received but hasn’t yet fulfilled fell to $12.9
billion as of June 30, from $15.4 billion at the end of 2011.  “The backlog decline was primarily driven by a significant
slowdown in the flow of new orders, as a result of the weakness
of the global economy,” Pedro Balcao, Renan Manda and Bruno Amorim, analysts at  Banco Santander Brasil SA (BSBR) , wrote in a note
to clients dated today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
