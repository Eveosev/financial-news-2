Japanese  stock   futures  were little
changed before the  Bank of Japan  ends a two-day meeting today,
while investors examined minutes of a Federal Reserve meeting
for signs the central bank may add to U.S. stimulus measures.  American depositary receipts of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender, fell 0.3 percent from the
closing share price in Tokyo. Those of  Canon Inc. (7751) , which gets 80
percent of its revenue outside of Japan, rose 0.4 percent after
the yen fell against all of its 16 major counterparts yesterday.
ADRs of  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s second-largest oil
and gas producer, gained 0.2 percent as oil rose.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
September closed at 8,865 in Chicago yesterday compared with
8,850 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,860
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index were little changed today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
fell 0.1 percent in Wellington.  “Investors will sit on the fence until results of the BOJ
meeting come out,” said  Mitsushige Akino , Tokyo-based executive
officer at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co., which oversees
about 40 billion yen ($502 million). “Few expect the BOJ to do
more easing this time. If they do, I think stocks will rise with
the yen weakening.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.1
percent today. The index closed little changed in New York
yesterday, erasing losses in the final hour of trading as
investors weighed the Federal Reserve’s policy minutes from its
June meeting for evidence that the central bank may be closer to
additional stimulus actions.  BOJ Meeting  Trading volume on the Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average was
17 percent below the 30-day average yesterday before the Bank of
Japan meeting ends today. Ten of 17 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News expect no change to monetary policy after
sentiment among large manufacturers improved last quarter,
according to the BOJ’s Tankan survey released last week.  The yen fell 0.4 percent to 79.76 per dollar yesterday, the
biggest drop since June 29. A weaker yen boosts the value of
exporters’ overseas earnings when repatriated and eases
political pressure on the BOJ to do more to spur growth.  Oil for August delivery advanced $1.90 to settle at $85.81
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 2.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 6.7 percent advance by the
 S&P 500  and a 4.5 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.8 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 12.9 times for the
S&P 500 and 10.7 times for the Stoxx 600.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. was little changed at 88.06
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
