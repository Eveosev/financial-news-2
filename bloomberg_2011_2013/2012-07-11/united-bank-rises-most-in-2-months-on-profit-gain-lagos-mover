United Bank for Africa Plc ,
 Nigeria ’s fourth-biggest lender by market value, rallied the
most in almost two months after its second-quarter profit more
than doubled.  The stock climbed 4.9 percent to close at 4.29 naira in
Lagos, the biggest gain since May 14.  Net income for the period through June jumped to 27.1
billion naira ($168 million) from 10.3 billion naira a year
earlier, the Lagos-based lender said yesterday. Revenue
increased to 111 billion naira from 91.27 billion naira.  “The improvements confirm that the recovery in UBA’s
financials at the time of publication of its Q1 2012 financials
have continued into Q2,” FBN Capital wrote in an e-mailed note
to clients yesterday.  UBA recorded a net loss of 9.65 billion naira last year,
compared with a profit of 598 million naira a year earlier, it
said April 18.  “To sustain the impressive performance in the first half,
they need to keep impairment charges low and sustain the
improvement in net interest margins that we saw from the first
quarter into the second quarter,” Adesoji Solanke, a Lagos-
based Africa bank analyst at  Renaissance Capital , said by phone
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
