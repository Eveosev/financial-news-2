The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, probing a shortfall of $200 million in client funds
at Peregrine Financial Group Inc., must take immediate steps to
safeguard customer funds, a Republican commissioner said today.  The futures regulator should call an emergency meeting of
its technology advisory committee to weigh an industry-funded
system to verify customer funds daily,  Scott O’Malia  said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. He spoke a day after the CFTC
sued Peregrine in federal court amid claims of a $200 million
shortfall in an account that was supposed to be segregated.  “This is the second black eye for the industry,” O’Malia
said. “We can no longer tolerate any misappropriation of funds.
We’ve got to put an end to the fraud. And we’ve got to put in
place a system that no longer relies on human compliance. We
have to put in technology that prevents people manipulating
others’ money.”  The CFTC is facing new scrutiny from lawmakers and futures
industry participants less than a year after being scolded for
poor oversight following the collapse of  MF Global Holdings
Ltd. (MFGLQ) , which left a $1.6 billion shortfall in customer money.  Peregrine is under investigation over an alleged shortfall
after Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Russell Wasendorf Sr.
unsuccessfully attempted suicide. The  National Futures
Association  said the chairman may have falsified bank records
after only $5 million was found in an account that was reported
to have $225 million on or about June 29.  “In the wake of MF Global, this latest failure raises
serious questions about our current regulators and whether they
are capable of doing their jobs,” Senator  Richard Shelby , an
Alabama Republican and ranking member of the Senate Banking
Committee, said in an e-mail yesterday.  The CFTC can take steps immediately without requiring new
authority under the law, O’Malia said.  “We do not need to wait for congressional action,”
O’Malia said. “We do not need to wait for a rulemaking or other
things. This should be implemented today and we should have
real-time reporting of customer protection.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
