Syarikat Prasarana Negara Bhd ., the
Malaysian state-owned public transport operator, plans to sell 4
billion ringgit ($1.3 billion) of Islamic bonds this year to
finance the extension of rail lines in  Kuala Lumpur , a company
official said today.  “We hope to sell 2 billion ringgit in tenors of 10 to 20
years this quarter as we need the money for the line extension
and borrowing costs are low,” Mohd. Zahir Zahur Hussain, group
finance director, said in an interview in Kuala Lumpur today.
“We will look into selling the second portion of the bonds,
probably toward the end of the year.”  Mohd. Zahir said the Shariah-compliant notes will be
government-guaranteed and the company hasn’t hired bankers to
manage the sale yet. Prasarana last issued sukuk, or securities
that pay returns from assets to comply with Islam’s ban on
interest, in July 2011. It has total debt of 8.9 billion ringgit,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company’s planned offering comes after Danainfra
Nasional Bhd., a government-owned entity formed to help finance
the country’s subway, sold 2.4 billion ringgit of sukuk at a
record-low premium to local treasuries yesterday. Sales in
 Malaysia , the world’s biggest market of Shariah-compliant debt,
fell 9 percent to 23.4 billion in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
