Sucres et Denrees SA, a French sugar
trader with processing in  Russia , may offer a stake in Russian
assets to Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, a former regional governor, to
help protect operations, its head of the local business said.  “This can be the case if Mr. Ilyumzhinov helps to save our
assets from the corporate raiders,” Etienne Pelletier, also a
member of the company’s executive committee, said today by
phone. Ilyumzhinov, governor of Kalmykia until 2010 and World
Chess Federation president, has “necessary contacts,” he said.  Sucden, as the Paris-based company is known, plans to grow
in Russia and other  emerging markets  and has offered Ilyumzhinov
an option to invest in the proposed expansion, Pelletier said.  The trader has been in legal disputes over ownership of
Russian assets since 2008 after contracts to buy equipment for
plants were challenged by local counterparts. Sucden has three
sugar plants in Russia that processed 2.5 million metric tons of
beet into 316,000 tons of sugar last year, company data show.  Ilyumzhinov told  Vedomosti  today he plans to invest as much
as 300 million euros ($368 million) to boost Sucden’s business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
