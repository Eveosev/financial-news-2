The lira strengthened the most in
almost two weeks and bond yields dropped to a 10-month low after
 Turkey ’s  current-account deficit  narrowed more than economists
anticipated.  The lira appreciated 0.5 percent to 1.8075 against the
dollar at 5:07 p.m. in Istanbul, the biggest jump on a closing
basis since June 29. Yields on two-year benchmark bonds dropped
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.90 percent,
extending this month’s decline to 57 basis points. This was the
lowest closing level for bond yields since Sept. 9.  The current-account gap shrank for a seventh month in May
to $5.8 billion from $7.9 billion a year earlier, the central
bank said today. It was forecast at $6.2 billion, according to
the median estimate of five economists surveyed by Bloomberg. A
record shortfall at 10 percent of the gross domestic product led
the lira to plunge 18 percent in the biggest decline worldwide
last year.  “We expect to see further improvement in the current-
account deficit -- albeit slower pace compared to May -- in the
coming months thanks to the overall slowdown in economic
activity and relatively lower petroleum price,”  Ozgur Altug ,
chief economist at BGC Partners in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed
note.  Oil prices  are down 13 percent this year, helping Turkey’s
finances as the country imports almost all the oil it consumes.  The central bank provided liquidity to lenders today at
5.75 percent for a 27th consecutive day, the longest stretch of
funding at the lowest policy rate since March 21, reducing the
overnight borrowing costs in the  interbank market  to 8.2 percent
from 9.6 percent on June 29.  To contact the reporters on this story:
