Euro-denominated  money market funds 
face the same fate as U.S. funds in 2008, according to  Fitch
Ratings , with closures accelerating after the European Central
Bank cut its deposit rate to zero.  Funds will temporarily close to new investors and fees will
be reduced to maintain positive returns, Fitch said. Closures
will last until portfolios mature, which is on average 45 days
for most Fitch-rated euro money market funds and less than a
month for 60 percent of funds.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., (JPM)  the world’s biggest provider of
money-market funds, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) 
closed their European funds to new investments after the ECB’s
rate cut on July 5. Goldman Sachs said the European money market
is in “unchartered territory.”  “In this environment, the decision by some funds to
temporarily close to new investments is a prudent one to protect
existing investors and will not have any direct impact on
ratings,” Fitch analysts led by Alastair Sewell in London wrote
in a report. “We expect to see a pattern of temporary soft
closures continue across the sector.”  The deposit rate cut will push the euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, to a record low, the analysts said. Eonia
fell to 0.323 percent today, approaching the record low of 0.295
percent on June 3, 2010. Most overnight  bank deposits  will soon
pay between  minus 15 basis points and plus five basis points,
the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
