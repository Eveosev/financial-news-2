Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  PTT
Exploration & Production Pcl (PTTEP)  will probably battle for U.K. oil
and gas explorer  Cove Energy Plc (COV)  in a sealed bid auction,
Investec Bank Plc said.  The U.K. Takeover Panel may ask for revised final offers
should Shell and PTT’s competing bids remain live and not final
on 17 July, Stuart Joyner, head of oil and gas analysis at
Investec, wrote in an e-mailed report. If the auction process is
announced, then it may make sense for Shell to improve its offer
once more before the deadline.  PTT’s most recent offer for Cove of 1.2 billion pounds
($1.9 billion), or 240 pence a share, topped Shell’s 220-pence
bid. The bidding war may end in the richest takeover premium on
record for an oil and natural-gas explorer.  Cove owns an 8.5 percent stake in Mozambique’s Rovuma Area
1, where recoverable natural gas amounting to more than six
times the U.K.’s existing reserves has been discovered.  Shell has a chance to extend its offer before 7 a.m. U.K.
time tomorrow. PTT can do this by the same time on July 14,
according to Investec.  To contact the reporter on this story:
