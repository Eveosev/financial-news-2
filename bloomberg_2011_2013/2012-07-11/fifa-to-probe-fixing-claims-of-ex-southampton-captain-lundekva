Soccer ruling body  FIFA  will
investigate claims made by former Southampton captain Claus Lundekvam that incidents during his team’s Premier League
matches were fixed for betting purposes.  Lundekvam, 39, said in an interview with Norwegian TV
station NRK that he, teammates and opposing team captains
influenced when certain events happened during games and would
bet on them.  “It’s not something I’m proud of,” Lundekvam, who played
at Southampton from 1996 to 2008, told NRK. “We manipulated the
first throw-in, the first corner and the first free-kick. At
times we did it every week.”  FIFA today said in a statement it would open a probe of the
claims.  “FIFA is monitoring this issue and involved its chief
investigator in  England ,” it said. “Once all information is
known it will be decided who is leading the investigations.”  Lundekvam said he and his teammates never fixed the
outcomes of matches.  “There results were never on the agenda,” he said. “This
is something I would never have done. Even though what we did,
of course, was illegal, it was just a fun thing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
