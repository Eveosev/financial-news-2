The  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision  may require banks to apply a standardized format to
calculate their credit default risks in addition to internal
valuation models in order to meet their  capital requirements ,
Financial Times Deutschland reported.  This would prevent banks understating their capital needs
as both set of numbers would be published and show how much
capital a bank saves when using an internal model, the FTD said,
citing an interview with the Wayne Byres, secretary general of
the committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
