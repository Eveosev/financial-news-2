Eastern grain-growing regions in
 Australia , the world’s second-biggest wheat exporter, are set to
receive rain this week, boosting production prospects just as
dry weather threatens supply from the U.S., the biggest shipper.  Most of New South Wales, the country’s second-largest wheat
grower, and Victoria may get between 10 millimeters (0.4 inches)
and 25 millimeters in the four days to July 14, according to a
Bureau of Meteorology forecast today. Parts of eastern New South
Wales may get between 25 millimeters and 100 millimeters in the
period, according to a  weather  model on the bureau’s website.  Wheat in  Chicago  rose this week to the highest level since
April 2011 as dry weather from the U.S. to Russia threatened to
reduce global harvests. Australia may produce 24.1 million
metric tons of wheat this season, 6.2 percent below a previous
estimate, after dry weather curbed plantings, the Australian
Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences said
on June 13. Last year’s harvest was a record 29.5 million tons.  “We are certainly more optimistic for prospects for
Australian grain and oilseed production for the 2012-2013 season
given this current rain event,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity
strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , said from Sydney.  The Murray-Darling Basin, which produces about a third of
Australia’s food supply, may have its heaviest and most
 widespread  rainfall since March, forecaster Weatherzone said
yesterday. Water storage was at 92 percent of  capacity  as of
June 26, according to the  Murray-Darling Basin Authority .  Wheat for September delivery rose as much as 0.6 percent to
$8.265 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, and was at
$8.2625 at 10:35 a.m. in  Singapore . The most-active contract
reached $8.4475 on July 9.  To contact the reporter for this story:
