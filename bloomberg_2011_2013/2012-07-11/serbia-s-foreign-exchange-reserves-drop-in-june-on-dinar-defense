Serbia ’s foreign-exchange reserves
fell 0.1 percent in June as the National Bank of Serbia spent
euros to bolster the dinar and the government repaid debt.  Reserves declined to 10.16 billion euros ($12.5 billion) in
June from 10.17 billion in May and 12.1 billion euros at the end
of 2011, the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said in an e-
mail today.  Its net reserves, excluding deposits by commercial lenders
and money from the  International Monetary Fund , dropped to 5.42
billion euros from 5.53 billion in May, it said.  The bank’s defense of the dinar, which according to data
compiled by Bloomberg gained 1.5 percent against the euro in
June, cost 107.6 million euros, down from 472.7 million euros in
May.  The government repaid 75.2 million euros to domestic
creditors and 60.1 million euros to foreign lenders. Inflows
included 61.7 million euros of credits and donations, the
government’s euro-denominated borrowing of 140 million euros in
the local market, while banks added 166.6 million euros to meet
new, tightened reserve requirement rules.  Total reserves equalled 438 percent of M1 money supply,
down from 453 percent in the previous month.  Interbank foreign-currency trading rose in June to 1.82
billion euros from 1.1 billion euros in May, bringing the six-
month volume to 8.25 billion euros, the bank said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
