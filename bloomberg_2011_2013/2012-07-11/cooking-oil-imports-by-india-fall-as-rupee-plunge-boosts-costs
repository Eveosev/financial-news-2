Cooking-oil purchases by  India , the
world’s biggest consumer after  China , probably dropped for the
first time in five months in June after a plunge in the rupee to
a record low deterred importers. Futures in  Malaysia  tumbled.  Shipments slid to 850,000 metric tons last month from
862,550 tons a year earlier, according to the median estimate in
a Bloomberg survey of five processors and brokers. Imports of
 crude  and refined palm oil declined 16 percent to 600,000 tons
from 712,356 tons, the survey showed. The Solvent Extractors’
Association of India will publish shipment data next week.  Palm oil, used in candy and fuel, has slumped 17 percent
from a 13-month high in April on concerns that a slowdown in
China and the  European debt crisis  may curb demand. Lower Indian
imports may boost inventories in Malaysia, second-largest  palm
oil  supplier, as production enters the peak period. The rupee
sank to a low of 57.3275 to a dollar on June 22, raising the
cost of commodities priced in the U.S. currency.  “The rupee depreciation made imports expensive and kept
importers away,” said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive officer
of Mumbai-based brokerage Sunvin Group. “Buyers were also
holding back purchases to take advantage of the lower Indonesian
export tax in July.”  Indonesia  cut the  tax rate  for exports of crude palm oil in
July to 15 percent, a level last seen in January, from 19.5
percent in June, Deddy Saleh, director general of foreign trade
at the Trade Ministry, said June 25. The base price to calculate
the levy was cut to $944 a ton from $1,098, he said.  Monsoon Delay  Palm oil for September-delivery fell 2.3 percent to close
at 3,012 ringgit ($943) a ton, the biggest loss for the most-
active contract since June 14, on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange in  Kuala Lumpur . Futures rose to a 13-month high of
3,628 ringgit  on April 10.  A surge in imports in the past four months lifted cooking-
oil inventories including those at Indian ports to a record 1.7
million tons last month, according to the extractor’s
association. Stockpiles may be about 1.6 million tons as of July
1, Sunvin’s Bajoria said.  Purchases will increase in the next four months as the
worst start to the monsoon in three years delays soybean and
peanut sowing, he said. Imports will be between 800,000 tons and
900,000 tons a month until October, Bajoria said.  The area under oilseeds dropped to 2.65 million hectares
(6.5 million acres) as of July 6 from 3.73 million hectares a
year earlier, according to the farm ministry. Soybean planting
was 26 percent lower at 1.89 million hectares, it said.  Dwindling Supplies  Imports in the seven months through May  jumped  32 percent
to 5.61 million tons, according to the extractors’ association.
India bought 8.7 million tons in 2010-2011. Purchases will climb
to 9.7 million tons this year as local supplies are set to
decline to 6.65 million tons from 7.25 million tons, GG Patel &
Nikhil’s managing partner Govindlal G. Patel, who has traded
edible oils for more than three decades, said last month.  Crude  soybean-oil  imports probably surged to 125,000 tons
in June from 50,616 tons a year earlier, while sunflower-oil
purchases may have risen to 110,000 tons from 50,560 tons, the
Bloomberg survey showed.  Palm oil comprises almost 80 percent of India’s cooking-oil
imports. The nation buys palm from Indonesia and Malaysia, and
soybean oil from Brazil and  Argentina .  To contact the reporter on this story:
