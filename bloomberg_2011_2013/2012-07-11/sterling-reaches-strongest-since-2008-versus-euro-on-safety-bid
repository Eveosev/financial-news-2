The pound rose to the strongest
since November 2008 against the euro as concern that legislation
needed for  Europe ’s permanent bailout fund will be delayed
boosted demand for the relative safety of the U.K. currency.  Sterling gained the most this month versus the dollar amid
speculation minutes of the  Federal Reserve ’s June meeting to be
released today will show U.S. policy makers are moving closer to
expanding their stimulus program, weakening the greenback. U.K.
government bonds rallied, with the 10-year yield dropping to the
lowest level in a month.  “Investors are looking at jurisdictions outside of the
euro area such as the U.K.,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of
foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
in  London . “Sterling isn’t as fully valued as the Scandinavian
currencies, and the Swiss franc is off the agenda.”  The pound advanced 0.2 percent to 78.82 pence per euro at
4:20 p.m. London time after appreciating to 78.71 pence, the
strongest level since Nov. 3, 2008. The U.K. currency rose less
than 0.1 percent to $1.5521. It earlier climbed as much as 0.4
percent, the most since June 29.  Germany ’s top court said yesterday a decision on whether to
suspend legislation for the euro bloc’s permanent bailout fund
and fiscal treaty may take months rather than weeks due to the
complexity of the ruling.  ‘Unusually Critical’  The euro region is in an “unusually critical phase” and
the global economy would be hurt by a slump in Europe, German
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said today in an interview
on Deutschlandfunk public radio.  Sterling has gained 4.4 percent in the past year, the third
best performer after the yen and the dollar among the 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes.  The Fed will today release minutes of its June meeting when
it extended the maturities of assets on its balance sheet and
said it stood ready to take further action.  The 10-year gilt yield fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.56 percent after declining to 1.55
percent, the lowest since June 1. The 4 percent bond due in
March 2022 rose 0.255, or 2.55 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 121.795.  The U.K. is scheduled to sell 3.5 billion pounds of bonds
maturing in September 2022 at an auction tomorrow.  U.K. government debt has returned 3 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Treasuries rose 2.5
percent, and German bunds climbed 3.6 percent.  The pound’s advance through the level of 79 pence per euro
has opened up the way for a rally toward 77.84 pence, according
to  Michael Hewson , an analyst at CMC Markets U.K. Plc.  The level of 77.84 percent represents a 61.8 percent
retracement of the currency’s decline from 2007 to 2008, London-
based Hewson wrote in a note to clients.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
