Italy expects to raise 20.1 billion
euros ($31.3 billion) this year from a new property tax known as
IMU, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Piero Giarda said.  The projection is based on revenue from the first
installment of the tax in June, which amounted to 9.5 billion
euros, Giarda told lawmakers in the Rome-based lower house.  The initial target of 21.4 billion euros in revenue was
lowered as areas hit by an earthquake this year were temporarily
exempt from the tax, Giarda said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
