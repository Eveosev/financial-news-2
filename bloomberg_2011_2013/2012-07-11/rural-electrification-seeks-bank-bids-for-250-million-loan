Rural Electrification Corp. (RECL) , an
Indian state-owned lender to electricity projects, plans to
raise $250 million through a loan of as much as five years.  “We have invited bids from 33 banks,” Finance Director
Hari Das Khunteta said in a phone interview from New Delhi
today. The facility will have a three- to five-year maturity, he
said.  The company is seeking to pay about 240 to 270 basis points
more than the London interbank offered rate, Khunteta said.
Banks have until July 25 to bid to arrange the loan, which may
be denominated in either dollars or yen, he said.  Rural Electrification has the equivalent of $12.6 billion
of bonds and loans due by 2049, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
