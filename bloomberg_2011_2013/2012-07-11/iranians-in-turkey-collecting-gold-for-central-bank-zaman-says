Wealthy Iranians in  Turkey  are
collecting gold on behalf of the Iranian central bank and
exporting it to  Iran , Turkey’s  Zaman newspaper  reported.  The expatriates are strengthening the resources of the
Islamic republic’s central bank amid concern over tougher
sanctions against Iran, the Istanbul-based newspaper reported,
citing a Turkish economy administration official it didn’t name.  Iranians in Dubai and India are also collecting gold and
sending it to the Iranian central bank, Zaman said, citing the
official. Some gold is being imported into Turkey from  Europe ,
refined or re-shaped and then exported to Iran, Zaman said.  Turkey exported $1.4 billion of gold and precious metals to
Iran in May and has shipped $3.1 billion worth in the first five
months of the year, up from $13.3 million a year earlier,
according to data on the state statistics institute’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
