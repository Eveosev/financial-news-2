Spot gasoline in  California  weakened
against futures for the first time this week after the Energy
Department said regional inventories of the motor fuel increased
last week to the highest level since April.  Gasoline supplies  in the U.S. West Coast, known as the Padd
5 region, climbed for a second week, rising by 68,000 barrels,
or 0.2 percent, to 27.9 million in the week ended July 6, the
Energy Department said. That’s the highest inventory level in
the West Coast since April 27.  California-blend, or Carbob, gasoline in Los Angeles
dropped 2 cents to 1 cent a gallon above gasoline futures traded
on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 2:02 p.m. East Coast
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The fuel rose to a one-week high yesterday after  Tesoro
Corp. (TSO) ’s Los Angeles refinery was said to shut coker and
alkylation units and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Torrance plant reported
a unit breakdown.  Carbob in San Francisco fell 2.25 cents to a discount of
2.25 cents a gallon against Nymex gasoline futures.  California supplies of Carbob rose 195,000 barrels, or 4.2
percent, to 4.82 million last week, the state Energy Commission
said in an e-mailed report. Production of the fuel jumped 16
percent to 7.13 million barrels, the highest level for that week
in at least 10 years, the commission said.  Inventories of California-blend diesel, or CARB diesel,
fell 91,000 barrels, or 4.2 percent, to 2.08 million, according
to the state.  CARB diesel in  Los Angeles  slipped 0.13 cent to 4.5 cents a
gallon above Nymex heating oil futures. The same fuel in San
Francisco weakened 1 cent against futures to a discount of 2
cents a gallon, the lowest level since Feb. 2.  Distillate fuel oil inventories  in the West Coast jumped
1.06 million barrels, or 9.3 percent, to 12.4 million last week,
the highest level since April 6, the Energy Department said.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
gained for a third day, increasing 3.5 cents to a discount of
0.5 cent a gallon against gasoline futures. Low-sulfur diesel in
Portland advanced 2 cents to an 11-cent-a-gallon premium versus
heating oil futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
