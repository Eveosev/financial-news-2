American Water Works Co., the
largest publicly traded U.S. water and wastewater utility, is
conducting a project with Utah State University to measure how
often home water meters suffer “backflow” problems that may
cause public health issues.  The $648,000 project, funded in part by the Water Research
Foundation and utilities, is designed to monitor how frequently
water flows backward from residential pipes through the meter to
the drinking water system, with any contaminants in household
plumbing possibly tainting the water, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
