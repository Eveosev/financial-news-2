OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  has received bids of
more than $22 billion for its planned offerings of 10-year
dollar bonds and five-year euro notes, according to a banker
familiar with the matter.  The order book for Gazprom’s dollar notes reached about $15
billion, while demand for its March 2017 euro bonds is about 6
billion euros ($7.4 billion), the banker said, declining to be
identified because the deals haven’t been concluded.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  and OAO Gazprombank 
are organizing the sale, which may be priced today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
