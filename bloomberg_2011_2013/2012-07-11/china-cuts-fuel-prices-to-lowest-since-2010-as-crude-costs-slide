China , the world’s second-biggest
oil consumer, reduced fuel prices for the third time since May
after crude tumbled, easing costs for factories and motorists
while threatening profit margins at refiners.  The maximum at which gasoline can be sold at the pump fell
by 420 yuan ($66) a metric ton starting today and diesel slid by
400 yuan, the National Development and Reform Commission said in
a statement on its website yesterday. The cuts represent a
reduction of as much as 4.8 percent, according to Bloomberg
calculations based on average retail rates across the country.  Falling oil costs have allowed China, which imports more
than half its crude, to reduce fuel rates as its economy cools.
The government may say this week that gross domestic product in
the second quarter expanded at the slowest pace since 2009,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists. The cuts are
eroding margins at  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , or Sinopec,
and PetroChina Co., the nation’s biggest crude processors,
according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  “The result of the third consecutive fuel-price cut in two
months will be to push refining margins back into negative
territory which is clearly not good for refiners,”  Neil Beveridge , an oil and gas analyst at Bernstein in  Hong Kong ,
said in a note e-mailed today. “Although Sinopec has
underperformed since the first quarter and is now in deep value
territory, we see no clear catalysts in the near term.”  Share Prices  Sinopec slid 1.2 percent in Hong Kong yesterday after the
official Xinhua News Agency reported the price cut, without
specifying the size. It fell 0.2 percent to HK$6.42 at 10:03
a.m. today and is down 21 percent this year. PetroChina dropped
1.6 percent to HK$9.34 and has fallen 3.4 percent in 2012. The
benchmark  Hang Seng  index, down 0.6 percent, has gained 4.6
percent since Dec. 31.  The fuel-price reductions returned costs at the pump to
levels last seen in December 2010. The ceiling for 90-RON, China
III  gasoline  in Beijing fell to 9,100  yuan  a ton, or $4.09 a
U.S. gallon, according to the NDRC data. The China III
specification is similar to the Euro III fuel standard. The
NDRC, China’s top economic planner, also cut tariffs on May 10
and June 9.  Brent, a benchmark grade that China uses to gauge oil-
processing costs, averaged $95.93 a barrel in June, the first
time the mean price fell below $100 a barrel since January 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures for August were
at $98.38 in  London  today and have slumped 23 percent since this
year’s intraday peak on March 1.  Price Reforms  Gasoline and diesel prices are set by the NDRC under a
system that tracks the 22-day moving average of a basket of
crudes comprising Brent, Dubai and  Indonesia ’s Cinta. The
government may change fuel rates when the measure falls more
than 4 percent from the last adjustment. The NDRC said yesterday
the  criteria  for price changes were met on July 9.  The nation is waiting for an “appropriate time” to revise
its price mechanism, Zhou Wangjun, the deputy director of the
pricing department at the NDRC said in a webcast by Xinhua on
April 26. The system will be implemented when global  oil prices 
are “relatively low,” he said.  China’s economy  may have expanded 7.7 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, down from 8.1 percent in the prior
three months, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists before data due July 13. That would be
the slowest  pace of growth  since the first three months of 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
