Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s U.S. visitor tally
rose in June, the first increase in at least three months, while
the average time spent by each user also gained, according to
research released today by  ComScore Inc. (SCOR)   The number of U.S. unique visitors rose 1.1 percent to
159.8 million in June from May, following declines in each of
the two preceding months, according to the Reston, Virginia-
based  researcher . Average time spent online increased 5.1
percent to 400.2 minutes, or more than six-and-a-half hours,
after a gain of less than 1 percent the previous month.  Facebook, which held its initial public offering in May, is
counting on continued growth in users and the time they spend on
the site to boost demand for advertising. Most of Facebook’s
revenue comes from spending on ads and about half of the total
comes from the U.S. and Canada.  The owner of the world’s most popular social-networking
service will release second-quarter results July 26, the first
time since the  Menlo Park , California-based company held its IPO
in May.  The stock has struggled since its public debut at $38.
Shares fell 1.6 percent today to close at $30.97, or 19 percent
below the IPO price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
