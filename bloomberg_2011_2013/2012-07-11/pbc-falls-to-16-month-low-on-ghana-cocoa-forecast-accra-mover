Produce Buying Co. (PBC) , the biggest
buyer of  cocoa beans  from farmers in  Ghana  fell to the lowest in
almost 16 months after the Ghana Cocoa Board said its mid-crop
harvest may fall from a year earlier.  The stock, also known as PBC, fell 4.8 percent to close at
20 pesewas in Accra, the capital, the lowest since March 21,
2011.  Cocobod, as the regulator is known, yesterday forecast that
the mid-crop, the smaller of two annual harvests, would plunge
to 42,000 metric tons from 80,000 tons a year earlier, spokesman
Noah Amenyah said by phone today from Accra. PBCâ€™s revenue
depends on the number of tons of cocoa it is able to buy from
farmers in a season, Xorlali Torsu, a stock trader at Databank
Financial Services Ltd. in Accra, said by phone.  The company had targeted buying 55 percent of the harvest
that spans July to September, Deputy Managing Director George
Boateng said on June 8.  The harvest may be revised upward on good rains, Kwabena
Asante Poku, deputy chief executive officer at Cocobod, said by
phone today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
