U.S. stocks fell and the  Dollar
Index  touched a two-year high as Federal Reserve meeting minutes
disappointed investors looking for a definitive signal that the
central bank plans more stimulus. Commodities trimmed gains and
Treasuries were little changed.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.3 percent to
1,338.17 at 2:12 p.m. in  New York  after drifting between gains
and losses for most of the day. The Dollar Index, a gauge of the
currency against six major peers, rose 0.2 percent to 83.578,
the highest since July 2010. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities
increased 0.6 percent, paring a gain of as much as 1.5 percent,
as gold futures lost 0.7 percent.  Stocks turned lower and the dollar rallied as minutes from
the Fed’s June meeting showed a few Federal Reserve policy
makers said the central bank will probably need to take further
action to boost the labor market and meet its inflation target.  “A few members expressed the view that further policy
stimulus likely would be necessary to promote satisfactory
growth in employment and to ensure that the inflation rate would
be at the Committee’s goal,” according to the record of the
 Federal Open Market Committee ’s June 19-20 gathering released
today in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
