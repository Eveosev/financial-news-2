Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX) , part-owner of
South Africa’s biggest iron-ore mine, fell for a fourth day to
the lowest in almost six months after Citigroup Inc. said
slowing growth in  China  will hurt demand for base metals.  The stock fell as much as 2 percent to 175.85 rand and
traded at 177 rand by 12:47 p.m. in Johannesburg, the lowest
since Jan. 16.  Iron-ore prices may drop to $135 a ton in the third quarter
as China buys less of the material, Citigroup commodity
researcher Daniel Hynes said yesterday. Prices averaged $139 in
the three months through June, according to The Steel Index Ltd.
Exxaro owns 20 percent of Sishen Iron Ore Co., which produces
the steelmaking ingredient from its two mines in the Northern
Cape Province.  “Sishen is Exxaro’s biggest asset and China’s demand for
base metals is slowing,” Michael du Plooy, a stockbroker at PSG
Konsult, said by phone from  Pretoria . “Growth numbers are out
on Friday so shareholders will be watching quite closely.”  Data on July 13 may show  China’s economy  grew at the
slowest pace since 2009 in the second quarter, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
