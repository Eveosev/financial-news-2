Facebook Inc. (FB) , the world’s biggest
social-networking company, formed a partnership with  Comcast
Corp (CMCSA) .-controlled NBCUniversal to provide coverage of the 2012
 Olympic Games  in London.  Facebook will host an NBC Olympics page with news, results,
photo galleries, trivia and polls, NBC said today in a
statement. Users who “like” the site will get exclusive
content, according to the broadcaster, which said no money is
changing hands in the deal. NBC Olympics introduced a timeline
application on its website so Facebook friends can share
content.  NBC’s coverage of the games will include a social-media
segment featuring a daily poll and “Talk Meter,” a new
Facebook data tool that will tell viewers what users are saying
on the website about the Olympics. The games are scheduled to
begin on July 27.  The partnership underscores the increasing ties between
television and social media. In 2010, NBC began “Twitter
Tracker” for the Vancouver winter games, which created a visual
interface from messages, called tweets, about each sport.  “Social media is an important part of how fans consume and
interact during the Olympics,” Gary Zenkel, president of NBC
Olympics, said in the statement.  Facebook, based in  Menlo Park , California, fell 1.6 percent
to $30.97 at the close in New York. Comcast, based in
Philadelphia, rose 1.2 percent to $31.73.  To contact the reporter on this story:
