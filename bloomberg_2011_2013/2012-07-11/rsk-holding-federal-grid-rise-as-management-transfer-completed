OAO MRSK Holding,  Russia ’s largest
electricity distribution company, and Federal Grid Co. fell
after signing an agreement transferring MRSK under the
management of the high-voltage power transmission monopoly.  Federal Grid declined 2.2 percent to 23.18 kopeks by the
close in Moscow, the biggest drop since June 20. The shares rose
5.4 percent earlier. MRSK Holding slid 1.1 percent to 1.758
rubles after rising as much as 3.3 percent. The Micex Index fell
1.2 percent to 1,405.15.  Federal Grid “assumes the powers of the sole executive
body” of MRSK, the companies said in e-mailed statements today.
The management transfer will allow the companies to coordinate
the development and modernization of the electricity
distribution system and to implement a joint investment program,
the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
