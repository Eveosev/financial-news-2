European leaders need to act faster
to back troubled lenders and support nations in distress, the
head of Italy’s banking lobby said.  “Decisions aren’t being made with the urgency required by
markets, even when solutions have already been indicated,” said
 Giuseppe Mussari , chairman of banking association ABI. “ Europe 
must put measures in place that buy the time needed” for
individual countries to make structural changes, Mussari said.  Italian banks including  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Intesa Sanpaolo
SpA (ISP)  have had their credit ratings downgraded as the country
struggles with a recession and rising borrowing costs.  The lenders are now looking for European Union help after
Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  got his EU counterparts to
pledge support last month for plans to collectively finance
sovereign bond purchases and recapitalize troubled banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
