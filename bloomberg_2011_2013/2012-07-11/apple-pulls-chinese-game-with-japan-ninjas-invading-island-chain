A “Plants vs. Zombies”-style game
that depicts Japanese ninjas and sumo wrestlers invading an
island chain claimed by Beijing and Tokyo has been pulled from
 Apple Inc.’s (AAPL)   App Store .  The game, “Defend the Diaoyu Islands,” which had been
available on the Chinese-language version of the App Store, was
no longer listed Wednesday. The company that made the game,
Shenzhen ZQGame Network Co., said it was given no explanation
for the move, the China Daily newspaper reported today.  The company apologized to players and is in negotiations
with Apple over the game, China Daily said.  In the game, players defend the islands by unleashing
various attacks on the invaders, which include soldiers carrying
Japanese flags, ninjas and sumo wrestlers. The game plays music
from “Tunnel Warfare,” a Chinese movie about the Second Sino-
Japanese War.  Apple’s terms of service say that games on its App Store
“cannot target a specific race, culture, real government or
corporation or any other real entity,”  China Daily  said.  Apple’s Beijing-based spokeswoman Carolyn Wu didn’t
immediately return calls to her office and mobile phones, or
respond to an e-mailed request for comment.  The islands, known as the Senkaku in Japanese, are about
140 kilometers (87 miles) north of Japan’s Ishigaki Island
between  Taiwan  and Okinawa. Sovereignty over the area would give
the holder control of undersea natural gas and oil fields.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
