Mullah Krekar, an Iraqi cleric
residing in  Norway , has been indicted on charges of encouraging
terrorism and seeking to influence a witness, prosecutor Marit
Bakkevig said.  The terror charge covers threats of kidnapping and murder,
targeting former Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik and the
Norwegian people as a whole, she said by phone from Oslo today.  Some of Krekar’s comments were made during his own trial in
March, when he was sentenced to five years in prison for death
threats against people including Norwegian opposition politician
Erna Solberg. The new trial is set to begin in Oslo on August 7,
Bakkevig said.  “He doesn’t acknowledge guilt and will come to court well
prepared,” Krekar’s lawyer Brynjar Meling said by mobile phone.
Krekar stands by his comments and will argue that they were
taken out of context and have a different meaning to the
prosecution’s interpretation, Meling said, without commenting
further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
