Florida’s orange crop , the
world’s second-largest, will be 0.2 percent bigger than
forecast last month, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said.  About 146.5 million boxes of oranges will be picked in
the harvest that began in October and finishes this month,
up from 146.2 million projected last month, the USDA said
today in a report. The average estimate of seven analysts
and traders in a Bloomberg News survey was 146.26 million
boxes.  “The Valencia crop came in better than expected,”
 Jack Scoville , a vice president for Price Futures Group in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview before the figures
were released.  In the previous season, the harvest totaled 140.5
million boxes, according to the USDA.  Orange juice  for September delivery fell 0.6 percent
to $1.282 a pound yesterday on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. The commodity plunged 33 percent in the past year.  Yields in Florida will average 1.63 gallons per box,
up from 1.59 gallons last year, the USDA said.  A box weighs about 90 pounds (41 kilograms).  Brazil  is
the world’s biggest orange producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
