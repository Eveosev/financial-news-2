The grain crop in the southern
Russian region of Krasnodar, the countryâ€™s main cereal-growing
area, was unharmed by a deadly weekend flood, according to the
local agriculture ministry.  Damage occurred across less than 2 percent of the area sown
with grains and other crops in the flooded zone, spokeswoman
Yekaterina Melnik said by phone from Krasnodar today. In
statistical terms, that means the local crop was left intact,
she said.  The region reaped 11.4 million metric tons of grains last
year, or 12 percent of the national harvest, state figures show.
The death toll from the flooding reached 172 as of yesterday,
according to the local government, and 30,000 people were
affected by the disaster.  Farmers in Krasnodar harvested 2.9 million tons of grains
from 61 percent of the sown area as of yesterday, the ministry
said in a statement on its website. Yields averaged 4.2 tons a
hectare (2.47 acres), it said. That compares with about 5.4 tons
last year, figures from the national Agriculture Ministry show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
