French Budget Minister Jerome Cahuzac said the government will consider reducing the charges
paid by some industries to support social programs, in an effort
to boost their competitiveness.  Some businesses, such as  food production , could benefit
from a lowering of social charges to help reduce their labor
costs, Cahuzac said in an interview on France 2 television. Any
such changes would be negotiated with unions and employer
groups, he said.  Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said on July 10 that the
government would seek legislation in 2013 to reform the system
for financing social programs, while not spelling out details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
