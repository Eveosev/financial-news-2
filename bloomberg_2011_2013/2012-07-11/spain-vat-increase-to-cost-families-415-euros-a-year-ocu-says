An increase in value-added tax
announced today will cost Spanish families an average 415 euros
($510) extra a year, consumers’ organization OCU said in an e-
mailed statement.  “The raise will slow families’ spending as they are
already heavily affected by the crisis,” OCU said in the
statement, citing calculations based on the national statistics
institute’s data on household spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
