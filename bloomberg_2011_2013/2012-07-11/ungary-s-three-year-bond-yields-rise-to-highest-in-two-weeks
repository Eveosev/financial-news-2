Hungary’s three-year government bond
yields rose to the highest in two weeks after data showed the
country’s inflation accelerated more than forecast in June and
the government said it won’t change a disputed tax law.  The slump in the government’s benchmark notes due in 2015
lifted yields four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
7.667 percent by 10:50 a.m. in Budapest. That’s the highest
since June 27. The forint appreciated 0.2 percent to 287.66 per
euro.  Consumer prices rose 5.6 percent in June from a year
earlier, the statistics office in Budapest said today, more than
the 5.4 percent-estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
Hungary won’t change its new tax on financial transactions even
if the European Central Bank objects to the levy, Prime Minister
 Viktor Orban  said in a HirTV interview yesterday, a week before
a delegation from the  International Monetary Fund  and the
European Union is set to visit Budapest to discuss the country’s
aid request.  “Hungarian assets may also be under pressure, since PM
Orban yesterday in a televised interview said there is no way he
would retreat on the financial transaction tax,” Kata Baller, a
Budapest-based analyst at DZ Bank AG, wrote in a research report
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
