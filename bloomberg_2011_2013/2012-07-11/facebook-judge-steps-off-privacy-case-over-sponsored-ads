A federal judge in  San Jose ,
California, recused herself from overseeing a proposed
settlement of a privacy lawsuit against  Facebook Inc. (FB)  over the
social networking site’s “Sponsored Stories.”  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh today referred the case for
reassignment to a different judge and canceled a hearing
scheduled for tomorrow in which Facebook seeks Koh’s final
approval of a settlement of the suit. Koh didn’t give an
explanation for her recusal.  An increasing number of Facebook users have filed
objections this week to the company’s proposed accord with a
group of subscribers who challenged a program linking their
likenesses to certain types of advertisements.  Under the proposed agreement, Facebook agreed to pay $10
million to be shared among advocacy groups for children,
consumers and electronic privacy. The company also consented to
revising its terms of usage so users can more easily see when
they’re being shown as endorsers of products and games for which
they clicked a “like” button and so they can limit the display
of their content and interactions alongside “sponsored
stories.”  Andrew Noyes, a spokesman for the  Menlo Park , California-
based company, declined to comment on the decision.  The case is Fraley v. Facebook Inc., 11-cv-01726, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
