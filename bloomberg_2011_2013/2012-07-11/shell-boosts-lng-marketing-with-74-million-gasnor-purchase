Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  will buy
Norwegian liquefied natural-gas supplier  Gasnor  for $74 million
to target marine customers before new environmental regulations
are introduced in 2015.  Shell, which already holds 4.1 percent of Gasnor, expects
the acquisition to be completed in the third quarter, according
to a statement today.  Gasnor produces the fuel at three small-scale plants, and
distributes LNG and compressed gas by two tankers and several
trucks to customers in  Norway . Shell, whose share of gas output
overtook oil production this year, wants to expand the use of
LNG as a transport fuel.  “Shell will capitalize on Gasnor’s experience in LNG sales
and marketing, combining it with its own customer reach to
target European marine customers ahead of new environmental
regulations that will come into force from 2015,” the company
said.  Shell, which has stakes in a quarter of the world’s LNG
vessels, has been expanding plans to supply the fuel to the
 transportation industry . Last month, it agreed with
TravelCenters of America LLC to sell LNG to heavy duty trucks in
the U.S. That followed last year’s agreement to work on the
 Green Corridor  project with Flying J Inc. to offer LNG to trucks
along the 900 mile (1,600 kilometer) highway from  Alberta  to the
Pacific coast in Canada.  To contact the reporters on this story:
