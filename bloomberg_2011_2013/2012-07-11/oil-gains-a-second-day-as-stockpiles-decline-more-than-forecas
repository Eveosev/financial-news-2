Oil fell in New York on signs from
 Asia  and the U.S. that the global recovery is faltering and
eroding demand for fuels.  Futures slid as much as 1.2 percent after  South Korea 
unexpectedly cut  interest rates ,  Australia ’s jobless rate rose,
and the  International Energy Agency  trimmed its oil demand
outlook for this year and predicted “muted” growth in 2013.
U.S.  gasoline  inventories rose almost six times as much as
forecast and fuel use declined, a report from the Energy
Department showed yesterday. The euro slumped to a two-year low,
and  European stocks  declined after minutes released by the
 Federal Reserve  disappointed investors.  “The supply side has been tightening, but the demand side
of the equation is still very poor,” said Guy Wolf, a
strategist at Marex Spectron Group Ltd., a London-based
commodities broker. “The European liquidity drain is starting
to impact heavily on their domestic economy. That is occurring
as  China  slows aggressively and the U.S. recovery has stalled.”  Crude for August delivery declined as much as $1.35 to
$84.46 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was at $84.56 at 12:50 p.m. London time. The
contract yesterday climbed $1.90 to $85.81, the highest close
since July 9. Prices have decreased 14 percent this year.  Brent Crude  Brent oil for August settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange slid as much as $1.72, or 1.7 percent,
to $98.51 a barrel. The European benchmark contract was at a
premium of $14.38 to New York-traded West Texas Intermediate.
The spread was $14.42 yesterday, the widest in four weeks.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.9 percent. The euro
dropped 0.5 percent to $1.2181 and reached $1.2173, the lowest
since June 30, 2010.  Officials debated the need for further stimulus measures at
the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s June 19-20 meeting, minutes
released yesterday in  Washington  showed. Two participants
supported additional bond purchases, while two others said only
a further deterioration in the economy would warrant the step.  The IEA forecasts faster growth in world oil demand next
year as the global economy recovers, in contrast to the slower
expansion that OPEC projected in a report yesterday.  Oil consumption will increase by a “relatively muted” 1
million barrels a day, or 1.1 percent, to an average of 90.9
million a day in 2013, the Paris-based adviser said today in its
first outlook for the coming year. That’s a higher growth rate
for next year than the 800,000 barrels a day that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries estimated
yesterday. Demand in emerging economies will surpass that of
developed nations for the first time in 2013, the IEA forecasts.  Revised Outlook  Global oil consumption will increase by 800,000 barrels a
day, or 0.9 percent, to average 89.89 million barrels a day this
year, or 15,000 a day less than the agency predicted last month.  Oil in  New York  has technical support along the middle
Bollinger Band on the daily chart, around $83.38 a barrel today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures have halted
declines near that indicator every day since July 6. Buy orders
tend to be clustered close to chart-support levels.  Prices surged 2.3 percent in New York yesterday after an
Energy Department report showed a bigger-than-expected drop in
U.S. crude stockpiles.  Australian employers unexpectedly cut payrolls in June, and
the jobless rate rose for a second month, to 5.2 percent from
5.1 percent, data from the statistics bureau in Sydney showed.
South Korea reduced its benchmark seven-day repurchase rate by a
quarter of a percentage point, highlighting concern that exports
are threatened by  Europe ’s failure to resolve its debt crisis.  Gasoline Inventories  U.S. gasoline stockpiles rose 2.8 million barrels last
week, compared with a median estimate of 500,000 in the
Bloomberg survey of analysts. Inventories have increased the
past four weeks, the longest stretch of gains this year, the
Energy Department data showed. Distillate inventories, a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, rose 3.1 million
barrels compared with a projected 625,000-barrel gain. Crude
supplies slid 4.7 million barrels.  Total  fuel use  in the U.S. dropped 1.1 percent to 19
million barrels a day in the four weeks ended July 6, the
biggest decline since February, the report showed.  Global oil consumption will rise by an average of 900,000
barrels a day this year, or about 1 percent, OPEC projected
yesterday in its monthly report. Growth will slow in 2013 to
800,000 barrels a day as the economy cools, according to the 12-
member group’s first assessment for next year.  Markets will be “comfortable” because of increased
production by non-OPEC members, the report showed. OPEC, which
accounts for about 40 percent of global supplies, said it will
need to provide an average 29.6 million barrels a day in 2013.
That’s 300,000 barrels less than this year and about 1.8 million
below current production rates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
