Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index advancing for the first time in four days, after
Premier Wen Jiaboa’s call for more investment in infrastructure
lifted railway and telecommunications shares.  China Railway Construction Corp. (1186)  led gains in the sector.
China Telecom Corp., the mainland’s biggest fixed-line carrier,
gained 1.8 percent. Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. jumped 3.6
percent, leading developers higher after JPMorgan Chase & Co.
raised it’s rating on the city’s largest property company.  The Hang Seng Index rose 0.1 percent to 19,419.87 at the
close after earlier falling as much as 0.8 percent. Three shares
gained for every two that fell on the 49-member gauge. The Hang
Seng China Enterprise Index of mainland companies dropped 0.1
percent, paring losses of as much as 1.3 percent.  The benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 10 percent from this
year’s high in February on signs Europe’s debt crisis is
worsening and growth is slowing in China and the U.S., dragging
the  value  of shares on the gauge to 10.1 times estimated
earnings on average. That compares with 12.9 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 10.7 times for Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index lost 0.2 percent to 19,395.
The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  fell 1.4 percent to 19.40, indicating
traders expect a swing of about 5.6 percent in the benchmark
index during the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
