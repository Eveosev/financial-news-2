Croatia ’s economy will probably
contract 1.5 percent this year as the euro-area’s debt crisis
curbs investment, a survey of economists by the  Croatian Banking
Association  shows.  The average estimate of economists from Croatia’s six
biggest banks in terms of assets lower than a similar forecast
of a 1.3 percent contraction published in January. The banks
include  Zagrebacka Banka d.d. , the Croatian unit of  UniCredit
SpA (UCG)  and  Privredna Banka d.d. , a unit of  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA. (ISP)   Economists also said the inflation rate will reach 3.3
percent this year, up from their January prediction of 2.5
percent. They also narrowed their budget-deficit forecast to 4.7
percent of gross domestic product from an earlier forecast of
4.9 percent, following the government’s fiscal cuts announced on
Jan. 31.  Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said in an interview on July
7 that  Croatia’s  economic-growth forecast of 0.8 percent will be
“hard” to achieve this year as Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis
curbs investment,  The six-month-old Cabinet led by Milanovic’s  Social-
Democrats  made the forecast in January, planning to lure 8
billion kuna ($1.3 billion) of funds from international lenders
and the European Union to modernize infrastructure.  The  World Bank  predicts the Balkan economy will shrink 1
percent in 2012, while the  central bank  on July 9 revised its
forecast to 1.6 percent contraction from a 1 percent decline
seen in May.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
