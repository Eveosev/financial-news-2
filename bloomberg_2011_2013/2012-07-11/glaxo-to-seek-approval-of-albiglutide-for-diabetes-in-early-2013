GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  said it will
seek regulatory approval of its experimental diabetes medicine
albiglutide early next year after the drug showed a benefit in a
trial.  Patients taking albiglutide, a once-weekly injection,
showed a statistically significant reduction in blood sugar
levels compared with Merck & Co.â€™s sitagliptin, London-based
Glaxo said in a statement today. The study is one of eight for
the drug and the last required to complete the approval
registration package, Glaxo said.  Albiglutide, along with the lupus treatment Benlysta and
darapladib for heart disease, form a trio of drugs Glaxo has
developed with  Human Genome Sciences Inc. (HGSI)  If approved, the
product would compete with existing medicines from  Amylin
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AMLN)  and Novo Nordisk A/S, as well as other
experimental drugs being developed by Sanofi and Eli Lilly & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
