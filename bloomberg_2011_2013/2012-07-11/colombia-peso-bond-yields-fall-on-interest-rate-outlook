Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to a record low, on speculation the central bank will cut
borrowing costs amid slowing inflation and decelerating economic
growth.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in 2024 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 6.88 percent in Bogota, according to the central bank. That
is the lowest close since the securities were first issued in
2009. The bond’s price rose 0.268 centavo to 124.939 centavos
per peso.  “The market is seeing a rate cut in September or
October,” said Jorge Cardozo, an analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Corredores Asociados. “Economic indicators are
showing we’ll see slowing growth in the second quarter.”  The central bank’s next move is more likely to be an
interest-rate cut rather than an increase, board member Cesar
Vallejo said in an interview yesterday. That follows comments
from central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe that policy makers will
probably reduce their forecast for the country’s 2012 growth
from the current range of 4 percent to 6 percent.  Banco de la Republica held the  overnight lending rate  at
5.25 percent for a fourth straight month on June 29 as growth
cooled and prices of the country’s commodity exports dropped.
Government reports in June showed industrial output and retail
sales unexpectedly fell in April and the economy expanded 4.7
percent in the first quarter, the slowest pace since 2010.  “The whole board agrees that a weaker  exchange rate  would
be desirable,” Vallejo said.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 1,785.21 per dollar,
extending its gain this year to 8.6 percent, the best
performance among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Auction TKs  Yields on Colombian peso bonds due in August 2026 fell to
7.01 percent at a government auction of fixed-rate securities
today. The yield on the bonds declined from 7.08 percent at the
auction on June 27.  Colombia also sold bonds due in May 2022 to yield 6.88
percent, down from 6.98 percent, while the yield on the June
2016 securities fell to 5.89 percent from 5.97 percent, the
 Finance Ministry  said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
