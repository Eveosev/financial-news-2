Iran ’s government has postponed
further cuts in energy and food subsidies until the next Iranian
year that starts March 21, 2013,  Shargh  reported, citing Saeed
Arbabi, a member of the parliament’s economic committee.  The government and the economic committee made the
“rational” decision to halt the plan in light of the level of
inflation, Arbabi said, according to the Tehran-based newspaper.
Raising prices by as much as 20 percent when they are already
high “would have serious consequences,” he said.  Iran started a five-year program in December 2010 to
gradually remove food and energy subsidies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
