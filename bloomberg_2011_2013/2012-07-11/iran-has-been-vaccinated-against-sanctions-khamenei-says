Iranian Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  said his nation has become immune to Western sanctions
and won’t suffer.  “These days, Westerners are making a whole lot of noise
regarding sanctions against  Iran ,” Khamenei was quoted as
saying in Tehran today by the official  Islamic Republic News
Agency . “They don’t understand that throughout the last 30
years they themselves vaccinated the Iranian nation against
sanctions.”  Khamenei’s comments come after a European Union embargo on
the purchase of Iranian oil came into force on July 1. Those
sanctions are in addition to existing U.S.-led limits on trade
and banking with Iran.  “The Iranian nation in the past three decades stood
against all the conspiracies and sanctions and made progress and
now we are 100 percent stronger than 30 years ago,” Khamenei
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
