New York  Mets pitcher Dillon Gee
will have surgery to repair damage to a shoulder artery that was
clogged by a blood clot, the New York Daily News reported,
citing a person familiar with the operation.  Gee, who was released from a New York hospital yesterday
after doctors used a catheter to break up an arterial blood clot
in his right shoulder, will be in  St. Louis  tomorrow for surgery
at the Barnes-Jewish Hospital, the newspaper said.  After an eight-week recovery, Gee could return to the
team’s lineup before the end of the regular season on Oct. 3,
although it is “probably not likely,” the Daily News said,
citing the person familiar.  The Mets declined to comment on the report.  The surgery will prevent a recurrence of clotting in the
same location for the 26-year-old right-hander, who was placed
on the disabled list two days ago.  Gee has a 6-7 record this year with a 4.10 earned run
average. A third-year player who was drafted by the Mets in 2007,
he is 21-15 with a 4.06 ERA for his career in  Major League
Baseball .  The Mets yesterday also announced that left-handed pitcher
Josh Edgin will be added to the team’s active roster today.
Edgin, 25, was 3-2 with a 3.89 ERA and one save in 35 games for
Triple-A Buffalo this season.  New York is 46-40, 4 1/2 games behind the National League
East-leading Washington Nationals as it begins the second half
of the season. The Mets open a six-game road trip against the
Atlanta Braves tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
