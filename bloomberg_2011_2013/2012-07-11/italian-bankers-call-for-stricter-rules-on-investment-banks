Italy’s association of banks called
for stricter rules on investment banks after  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
admitted to manipulating the London interbank offered rate, the
global benchmark for $360 billion of securities.  “How is it possible that key indicators for commercial
banks and their clients are determined in a fraudulent manner by
non-commercial banks?” said  Giuseppe Mussari , chairman of the
Italian banking association ABI, today in  Rome .  To contact the reporter on this story:
