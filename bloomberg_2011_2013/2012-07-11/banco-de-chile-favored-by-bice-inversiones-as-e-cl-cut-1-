Banco de Chile ,  Chile ’s largest
lender by assets, was added to Santiago-based brokerage BICE
Inversiones’s list of favorite stocks, replacing power generator
E-CL SA.  BICE added the lender to its list of 10 favorite Chilean
stocks with an 8 percent weighting, citing the bank’s ability to
withstand global economic turmoil.  “Banco de Chile stands out in the local market due to its
low external risk, potential efficiency improvements and an
adequate management of risk,” analysts Claudia Cavada and
Rodrigo Jacob said in an e-mailed note to clients today. “We
excluded E-CL, despite its fall this year, due to a lack of
medium-term catalysts.”  BICE expects E-CL quarterly results to be hurt by rising
fuel costs, a decline in rates for unregulated contracts and
lower thermoelectric sales to the central  power grid .  E-CL rose 0.1 percent to 1,158 pesos at 10:22 a.m. in
Santiago, paring its retreat this year to 16 percent. Banco de
Chile advanced 0.4 percent to 69.02 pesos. The stock has
retreated 0.4 percent this year.  Power generator  Empresa Nacional (ENDESA)  de Electricidad SA and
carrier  Latam Airlines (LFL)  Group SA remain as BICE’s favorite local
stocks, the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
