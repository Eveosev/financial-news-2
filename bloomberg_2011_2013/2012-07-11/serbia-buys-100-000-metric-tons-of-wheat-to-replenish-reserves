Serbia is buying 100,000 metric tons
of wheat from this year’s harvest from local producers to
replenish commodity reserves.  The government is paying 23 dinars ($0.24) per kilogram of
wheat that meets its quality standards and pledges to pay the
producers within eight days of delivery, the  Agriculture
Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement.  The quantities will range from 5 tons to 100 tons from
individual farmers and as much as 150 tons from local
cooperative farms, the ministry said.  Serbia’s harvest estimate this year ranges from 1.6 million
tons to 2 million tons, based on an average yield of 3.5 tons to
4 tons from 482,613 hectares (1.2 million acres) sown to wheat.
The wheat harvest will fall 7.7 percent this year to 1.91
million tons due to lower yield and smaller planting areas
compared to 2011, the statistics office said in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
