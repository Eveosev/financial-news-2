A  Bayer AG (BAYN)  unit will pay $15 million
to settle a U.S. lawsuit claiming it illegally marketed aspirin
mixed with supplements.  The settlement between the unit, Bayer Healthcare LLC, and
U.S. consumers received preliminary approval today from a
federal judge in  Brooklyn , New York.  “Clearly, this was a hard-fought case,” Judge Brian M. Cogan said at a hearing. “The settlement negotiations were
extensive. Significant compromises were made by both sides.”  Bayer Healthcare was sued by consumers in 2008 over its
Bayer Women’s Low Dose Aspirin + Calcium and Bayer Aspirin with
Heart Advantage, containing the supplement phytosterols.  The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  warned the company
the same year that it considered the aspirin mixtures
“unapproved new drugs” and that they were being sold
unlawfully. Over-the-counter drugs don’t typically require FDA
approval as long as they conform to pre-approved formulas,
according to the agency’s website.  The settlement would include all U.S. consumers who
purchased the drugs within predetermined timeframes. The deal
requires final approval by the court.  Anne Coiley, a spokeswoman for Leverkusen, Germany-based
Bayer, didn’t have an immediate comment on the settlement.  The case is Goldberg v. Bayer Healthcare LLC, 1:08-cv-
04623, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of  New York 
(Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
