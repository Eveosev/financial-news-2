Boeing Co. (BA)  and Eurofighter GmbH are
among aerospace companies revising their strategies to win
military exports as shrinking weapons budgets in their home
markets increase the importance of overseas contracts.  Boeing, the No. 2 defense contractor after  Lockheed Martin
Corp. (LMT) , said it’s increasingly utilizing the marketing expertise
of its commercial aircraft unit, while Eurofighter, the Typhoon
warplane maker part-owned by  BAE Systems Plc (BA/) , is reviewing its
bidding strategy after losing out on a series of recent tenders.  Western defense companies are stepping up export drives to
help cope with a reduction in arms budgets from  Washington  to
Rome as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down and austerity
programs bite. Military spending is still climbing in markets in
the  Middle East ,  Asia  and  Latin America , said Dennis Muilenburg,
who heads Chicago-based Boeing’s defense unit.  “Opportunities around the globe are there, but we see more
of our U.S. competitors being present and also more emerging
entrants,” he said in an interview at the Farnborough air show
outside London.  Eurofighter, reeling from lost bids in  India ,  Japan  and
 Switzerland , is looking at ways to tender for contracts without
“additional markups” to the base price in competitions where
the specification would normally require them, according to Enzo Casolini, the consortium’s chief executive officer.  Money-Maker  With Eurofighter targeting at least 20 percent of the 800
export sales it estimates will come over the next two decades,
London-based BAE, European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. of
Toulouse, France, and Rome-based  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) , its three
owners, have sanctioned a review that should be completed by the
year’s end, Casolini said in a briefing in Farnborough.  “The three of us agree we need to find a way to put this
airplane on the market at a lower price and win projects,”
Finmeccanica CEO Giuseppe Orsi said at a briefing in London,
adding that the warplane program remains “a good money maker.”  Eurofighter is competing for a South Korean order with
Boeing’s F-15 and the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.
It is also targeting Saudi Arabia, which is already buying 72
aircraft, Qatar, with a potential for as many as 36 sales, plus
the United Arab Emirates,  Malaysia  and others, he said.  Upgrades Agreed  U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  said at Farnborough that
the integration of newer technology and the addition of a more
capable air-to-air missile, considered vital in developing the
jet, have the backing of Britain, Germany,  Italy  and  Spain .  “The four partner nations have agreed to take the next
steps toward exploring growth potential of Typhoon,” he said.  Italy’s Finmeccanica has also used acquisitions as a tool
to boost exports, Orsi said, adding Poland’s PZL-Swidnik in 2009
to establish the country as a “home market” and improve its
chances of selling helicopters and training aircraft.  At Boeing, cooperation with the commercial arm was
instrumental in securing Indian contracts for P-8 maritime
patrol aircraft and C-17 military transports, Muilenburg said.  “Without BCA’s strength it would have been difficult to
get the deals,” he said. “That was a market opening
opportunity because of Boeing’s global presence and supply
chain.”  The U.S. company aims to reach at least 25 percent of
defense revenue from exports, the executive said. Boeing
achieved 24 percent in 2011, and may reach a portion of 30
percent this year, Muilenburg said. That’s up from single digit
figures only a few years ago.  Hot Spot  Success in fighter campaigns will be central to sustaining
that business share, with Boeing Military Aircraft President
Chris Chadwick predicting the fighter market to remain “hot.”
Foreign sales and follow-on orders from the Pentagon should
stretch F/A-18E/F Super Hornet production through the end of the
decade, matching the F-15 line, he said.  Boeing has also developed partnerships in major markets
such as  Brazil , where it signed a cooperation with  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  in
April before disclosing plans to develop and market the local
planemaker’s KC-390 transport. It will also help integrate
weapons on Embraer’s A-29 Super Tucano, which is being pitched
for a Pentagon requirement to supply Afghanistan’s government
with 20 light-attack aircraft.  Lockheed Martin aims to extend its international business
above 20 percent of sales from 17 percent, Chief Operating
Officer Marillyn Hewson said. While much of that growth will
come from the F-35, F-16 production set to shutter in 2015 will
be extended through additional orders.  Single-Engine Boost  Austerity programs may be spurring demand for less costly
single-engine fighters such as the F-16, according to Haakan Buskhe, CEO of Sweden’s  Saab AB (SAABB) , which makes the Gripen jet.  “I see a much bigger interest for Gripen now than I did
before the crisis,” Buskhe said in an interview at the air
show.  European missile maker MBDA, owned by Finmeccanica, BAE and
EADS, is working with its domestic customers to ensure that
specifications are written with foreign buyers in mind, CEO
Antoine Bouvier said, with the “exportability of new products
an objective in a way which it was not a few years ago.”  Overseas markets are driving decisions regarding a new
powered bomb MBDA is making for the U.K., while there is a
strong export outlook for the Fire Shadow loitering missile,
designed to allow army units to effectively provide their own
air support before ground attacks, Bouvier said. India and
several Gulf states expressing an interest, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
