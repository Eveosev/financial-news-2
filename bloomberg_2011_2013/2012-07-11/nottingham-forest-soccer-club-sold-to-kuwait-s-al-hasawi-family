Nottingham Forest said Kuwait’s Al-
Hasawi family completed its takeover of the English soccer club
from the estate of the two-time European champion’s late owner.  Fawaz, Abdulaziz and Omar Al-Hasawi agreed to acquire the
controlling stake of Nigel Doughty, who died in February four
months after putting the club up for sale. Financial terms
weren’t disclosed in a  statement  on Forest’s website last night.  “We know there are challenging times ahead of us to bring
the club back to its glory days,” the Al-Hasawis said last
night in the statement. “We look forward with excitement
towards a new successful future.”  Forest, which won back-to-back European Cups in 1979 and
1980 after winning its only domestic title in the 1977-78 season,
dropped out of  England ’s elite Premier League in 1999. It
finished 19th in the 24-team Championship last campaign.  The Al-Hasawi family, which made its fortune in
refrigeration and air-conditioning according to the U.K.’s  Daily
Mail , said it plans to hold a news conference July 14 at the
club’s City Ground stadium.  Editor: Dex McLuskey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
