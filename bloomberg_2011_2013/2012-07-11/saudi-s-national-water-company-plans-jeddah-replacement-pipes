National Water Co.,  Saudi Arabia ’s
state-owned utility, is planning about $1.07 billion of projects
in the Red Sea port of  Jeddah , including new pipes to handle
larger quantities of water and pumping stations.  National Water will replace sewage pipes in Jeddah’s
historic center at a cost of about 1.2 billion Saudi riyals
($320 million), with public bids expected in 2013 and completion
within 48 months, the company said today on its website.  The state-run utility has made repairs to leaks in Saudi
Arabia’s water transmission network that have saved 67 million
cubic meters of water since 2008, Osama Dardeer, senior manager
for corporate projects, said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
