Czech stocks reversed earlier losses
as  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  of Austria increased after the regulators
said the company exceeded capital reserve targets.  The 14-company  PX (PX)  gauge rose 0.3 percent to 906.90 today by
the end of trading in Prague, after earlier sliding as much as
0.7 percent. Erste, which has a 20 percent weighting in the
index, climbed 1 percent, reversing an earlier 2.2 percent loss.  Financial stocks gained in Europe after the European
Banking Authority said today that the region’s banks increased
their capital reserves by $116 billion in the first half of 2012
in a push to limit contagion from the euro area’s sovereign
crisis. Erste exceeded the capital targets, according to the
Austrian Central Bank and Financial Markets Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
