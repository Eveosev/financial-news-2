Canada ’s dollar rose against its
U.S. counterpart after minutes of June’s Federal Reserve meeting
showed “a few” policy makers supported expanding monetary
stimulus measures.  The currency briefly pared gains as stocks fell amid
disappointment the U.S. central bank didn’t provide a stronger
signal of plans to bolster the economy of Canada’s largest
trading partner. It climbed earlier along with its Australian
and New Zealand counterparts as commodities rose. Canada’s May
merchandise trade deficit was larger than forecast as imports
reached a record level,  Statistics Canada  reported in in Ottawa.  “People are turning around and taking risk off,” said  John Curran , a senior vice president in Toronto at CanadianForex
Ltd., an online foreign-exchange dealer, in a telephone
interview. “You’ve got half the market saying buy Canada
against this, sell Canada against those, and that’s why you’re
getting a muddied picture against the U.S.”  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie, appreciated 0.03
percent to C$1.0198 per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto. One
Canadian dollar buys 98.07 U.S. cents.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed, after
falling as much as 0.6 percent, while the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials added 0.7 percent.  Annual Prices  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, has traded this
year as strong as 98 cents per  U.S. dollar  on April 27 and as
weak as C$1.0447 on June 4.  “We’re in tight summer ranges,” said Firas Askari, head
currency trader in Toronto at Bank of Montreal in a telephone
interview. “I’m not highly optimistic about volatility this
summer, which in our business is not a good thing.”  Government bonds fell, pushing the yield on the nation’s
10-year benchmark debt up three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 1.68 percent. The 2.75 percent securities maturing in
June 2022 fell 26 cents to C$109.72.  The  Bank of Canada  sold C$3.4 billion ($3.3 billion) of
five-year notes today at a yield of 1.24 percent, compared with
1.53 percent at the previous sale May 9. The notes mature Sept.
1, 2017 and carry a coupon of 1.5 percent.  The bid-to-cover ratio -- the amount bid relative to the
amount offered -- was 2.65 times, compared with an average of
2.41 times at the past five auctions.  Yield Forecasts  Economists have cut their yield forecasts for Canadian
 government bonds  during the past month amid signs of weakness in
the  U.S. economy  and speculation the central won’t raise its
benchmark  interest rate  this year.  The benchmark 10-year bond will yield 2.08 percent by year-
end, according to the median of a survey of 16 economists,
compared to last month’s median of 2.15 percent. Yields will
rise to 2.85 percent by the end of 2013, down 5 basis points
from the prior survey. The 10-year note currently yields 1.65
percent.  “A few members expressed the view that further policy
stimulus likely would be necessary to promote satisfactory
growth in employment and to ensure that the inflation rate would
be at the Committee’s goal,” according to the record of the
 Federal Open Market Committee ’s June 19-20 gathering released
today in  Washington .  The FOMC met before a Labor Department report last week
showing that companies hired 80,000 workers in June, fewer than
forecast, and the  unemployment rate  held at 8.2 percent for a
second month.  Canada’s merchandise trade deficit was the widest in almost
a year as energy exports fell.  The deficit of C$793 million exceeded the C$430 million
shortfall that was the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 22 economists. The agency also boosted its April
deficit estimate to C$623 million from C$367 million.  The loonie has gained 2 percent this year among 10
developed-nation currencies in Bloomberg Correlation Weighted
Indexes, with the U.S. dollar adding 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
