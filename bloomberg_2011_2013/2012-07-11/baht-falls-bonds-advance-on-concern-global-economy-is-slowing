Thailand’s baht weakened and
 government bonds  advanced as concern global economic growth is
slowing reduced demand for emerging-market stocks.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares declined for a fifth
day after data this week showed Chinese imports missed estimates
in June and  Japan ’s machinery orders fell the most in more than
a decade. China is the biggest market for Thai exports, which
account for about two-thirds of its economy, while Japan is the
second largest. Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul
said on July 3 that risks to growth outweigh inflation pressure
as Europe’s financial crisis lingers.  “Recent data are not helping to remove growth concerns,”
said  Yuji Kameoka , chief currency strategist at Daiwa Securities
Co. in  Tokyo . “Investors are reluctant to take risks.”  The baht dropped 0.4 percent to 31.75 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 31.87 on
July 9, the weakest level since June 29. Its one-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was little changed at 4.52 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.32 percent as of
8:37 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
