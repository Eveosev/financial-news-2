The Czech Republic’s
telecommunications regulator announced final conditions for the
auction of frequencies,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported today citing
the regulator.  The spectrum at 1800 MHz will be set aside for new bidders,
which will be also offered access to networks of existing
operators, the newspaper said.  The regulator won’t offer the spectrum at 800 MHz, which is
favorable for existing operators and it effectively rules out
the entry of a new competitor, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
