Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  fell 0.1 percent to 63,048.76 at the close in Istanbul,
reversing earlier gains of as much as 0.7 percent. The gauge is
up 23 percent this year.  The following shares were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Dogusan Boru Sanayii & Ticaret AS (DOGUB)  , a maker of
cement pipes and fittings, fell to the lowest level in six
weeks, dropping 6.1 percent to 1.38 liras. Turkey’s asset sales
agency canceled the sale of a 56 percent state-held stake in the
company after the fourth and final bidder declined to sign an
agreement to buy it, according to a statement to the  Istanbul
Stock Exchange  after the close yesterday. A previous auction to
sell Dogusan was also annulled in May 2010 after it got no bids.  Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO, Turkey’s national carrier,
advanced the most this month, adding 3.1 percent to 3.37 liras,
after Deutsche Bank AG recommended investors buy the shares.
Deutsche Bank raised the target price on the stock to 5.1 liras
from 3.1 liras and upgraded it to buy from hold, according to an
e-mailed report received today.  Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM)  , Turkey’s largest fixed
line telephone operator, slid 1.4 percent to 7 liras. Turk
Telekom had its price estimate cut to 7.5 liras from 8 liras at
EFG Istanbul Securities and to 8.86 liras from 9.4 liras at
Finans Invest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
