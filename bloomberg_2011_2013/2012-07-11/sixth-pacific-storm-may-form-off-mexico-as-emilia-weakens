 A low-pressure system 450 miles
(720 kilometers) south of the Mexican resort of Manzanillo is
better defined and has an 80 percent chance of becoming the
sixth tropical cyclone of the Pacific season.  The National Hurricane Center also said Emilia weakened to
a Category 2 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale as
it moves west-northwest over Pacific waters at 105 miles per
hour about 720 miles southwest of  Mexico â€™s  Baja California .  The Miami-based center said in a 2 a.m. Pacific time
advisory that Emilia poses no threat to land and is forecast to
weaken further as it moves west. Tropical Storm Daniel will
cross into the central Pacific later today as it churns west at
16 mph about 1,050 miles east-southeast of  Hawaii , the NHC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
