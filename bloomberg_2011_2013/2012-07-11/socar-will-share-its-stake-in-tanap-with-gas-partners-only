State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan  said it
will share its stake in the Trans-Anatolia natural-gas pipeline
project, or Tanap, only with companies involved in gas projects
in the Caspian Sea nation.  “Only companies participating in gas contracts in
Azerbaijan will get a share of Tanap,” Rovnaq Abdullayev,
president of the Baku-based company also known as Socar, told
reporters in the Azeri capital today.  Abdullayev said his company will soon decide which
companies will get some of Socar’s 80 percent stake in the
pipeline project, estimated to cost $7 billion. The remaining 20
percent is held by Turkey’s state pipeline company Boru Hatlari
Ile Petrol Tasima AS, or Botas.  The Socar president earlier said partners in the Shah Deniz
project, including  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Total SA (FP)  and  Statoil ASA (STL) , have shown
interest in joning Tanap.  Azerbaijan and Turkey agreed on June 26 to build the 2,000-
kilometer (1,420-mile) pipeline to ship Azeri gas to the
European Union through Turkey.  Tanap will be linked up with either the Nabucco West link
or the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline, or TAP, to deliver the fuel to
the EU from the Turkish border.  The BP-led Shah Deniz group will choose between the two
links in May 2013, Abdullayev said earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
