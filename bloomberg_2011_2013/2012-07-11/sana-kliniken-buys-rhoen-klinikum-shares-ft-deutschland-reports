Sana Kliniken AG, the fourth-
largest commercial hospital operator in  Germany , bought shares
of  Rhoen-Klinikum AG (RHK)  after Fresenius KGaAâ€™s Helios failed to
take over the company at the end of June, Financial Times
Deutschland reported, without saying where it got the
information.  By now the three biggest competitors, Fresenius, Asklepios
and Sana Klinken, own shares in Rhoen-Klinikum, FTD said. Sana
Kliniken sees itself playing an active role in the consolidation
of the industry, FTD said, citing a company spokeswoman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
