Sual Partners, controlled by  Viktor Vekselberg  and  Len Blavatnik , wants United Co. Rusal board
members including independents to be  given the right to call
extraordinary shareholders meetings to vote on related party
deals, Interfax reported, citing a person it didn’t identify.  Currently such deals are approved by the board by a
majority vote, it said. Sual, locked in a shareholder conflict
over Rusal’s management with billionaire owner  Oleg Deripaska ,
owns 15.8 percent. Rusal, the largest aluminum maker, said today
Sual withdrew an earlier proposal to amend the company’s charter
and filed a new plan.  As the board needs to consider the latest offer, a proposed
shareholder meeting on Aug. 3 has been canceled, the company
said.  Rusal’s press office declined to comment when Bloomberg
called and Sual’s Andrey Shtorkh wasn’t immediately available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
