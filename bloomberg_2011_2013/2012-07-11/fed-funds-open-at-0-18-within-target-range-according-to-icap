Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.18 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.17 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.15 percent to 0.21 percent and averaging 0.17 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will acquire $4.25 billion to $5 billion
of Treasuries maturing from July 2018 to May 2020. The purchases
are part of the Fed’s program to replace $267 billion of short-
term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an
effort to keep borrowing costs low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
