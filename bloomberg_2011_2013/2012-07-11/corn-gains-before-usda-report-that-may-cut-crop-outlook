Corn rose in  Chicago  before a U.S.
government report that analysts expect will show a cut in the
forecast for the U.S. crop after drought across the Midwest hurt
yields in the world’s biggest grower. Wheat also gained.  December-delivery corn gained as much as 1.3 percent to
$7.265 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $7.225
by 12:06 p.m. in London. The most-active contract gained to
$7.33 a bushel on July 9, the highest level since September, as
hot, dry weather hits U.S. fields.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will probably cut its
estimate for this year’s U.S. corn output to 13.534 billion
bushels, from its June outlook for a record 14.79 billion,
according to the average of analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg
survey. Last year’s crop totaled 12.358 billion bushels. The
report is due for release at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .  “We think the supply situation is severe,” Credit Suisse
Group AG said in a report e-mailed today.  “Price risks remain
to the upside.”  A dimming production outlook in the U.S. may prompt the
USDA to cut its forecast for global  inventories  to 143.8 million
metric tons at the end of 2012-2013, from 155.7 million tons
last month, according to a separate Bloomberg survey.  China may seek alternative suppliers after the recent surge
in U.S. corn prices, China National Grain & Oils Information
Center said in a report. The country may import 6 million tons
in the next marketing year, it said.  Wheat for September delivery added 0.6 percent in Chicago
to $8.2525 a bushel. Milling wheat for November delivery traded
on NYSE Liffe in Paris slipped 0.5 percent to 247.25 euros
($303.92) a ton.  “The other region where grain production is expected to
decline significantly is the  Black Sea region ,”  Paul Deane , an
analyst at  Australia  and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., in a
report. “Early harvest reports have confirmed the extent of
damage to winter wheat in southern  Russia  and Ukraine.”  Soybeans for November delivery were little changed at
$15.3875 a bushel, after the most active contract rose on July 9
to $15.7125, the highest level since the global food crisis in
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
