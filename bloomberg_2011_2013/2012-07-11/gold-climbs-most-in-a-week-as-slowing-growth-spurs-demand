Gold gained the most in a week as
concern that global economic growth is slowing increased demand
for the metal as a protection of wealth.  A report today may show industrial production stagnated in
the euro area after two months of declines, while data on July
13 may show that  China’s economy  grew at the slowest pace since
2009 in the second quarter, according to Bloomberg surveys. The
The dollar slipped 0.3 percent against a basket of six
currencies, before the  Federal Reserve  releases minutes of last
month’s meeting, when it expanded a program of replacing short-
term bonds with longer-term debt.  “A bit of dollar weakness overnight has helped gold,”
said Saeed Amen, an analyst at Nomura International Plc in
London. “We could also see some reaction after the FOMC minutes
today as the market tries to assess how close we were to the
QE3, especially given that the recent U.S. data has been on the
weak side compared to expectations.”  Spot gold advanced 0.7 percent to $1,577.65 an ounce at
12:34 p.m. in London. A settlement at that price would mark the
biggest gain since July 3. In  New York , gold futures for August
delivery slipped 0.3 percent to $1,577.30 on the Comex, after
gaining 0.2 percent.  The euro gained as much as 0.4 percent against the dollar
after dropping to a two-year low yesterday, sending bullion down
by 1.3 percent.  “Issues surrounding  Europe ’s debt crisis and a slowing
economy in the U.S. and  China  will offer support to prices,”
said Sun Yonggang, a macroeconomic strategist at Everbright
Futures Co., a unit of China’s largest state-owned investment
group.  Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-
traded product backed by bullion, fell to 1,271.24 metric tons
as of yesterday, the least since May 31, the company’s website
showed.  Spot silver rose 1.2 percent to $27.135 an ounce. Platinum
for immediate delivery gained 0.3 percent to $1,428.75 an ounce.
Palladium climbed 0.5 percent to $578.30 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
