Major League Baseball ’s 83rd All-
Star Game attracted a record low television audience for Fox for
the third straight year as the National League scored five
first-inning runs on its way to a blowout win.  The All-Star Game in Kansas City, which the NL won 8-0 two
days ago, was seen on the  News Corp. (NWSA)  network in an average of
6.8 percent of U.S. homes, down from 6.9 percent last year and
7.5 percent in 2010. All were record lows, according to data
compiled by Nielsen Holdings NV.  Tuesday was the highest-rated night of network television
since June 21, when the Miami Heat beat the Oklahoma City
Thunder in Game 5 to win the National Basketball Association
Finals on Walt Disney Co.’s ABC, Fox said.  The NL’s first-inning runs came at the expense of Detroit
Tigers pitcher  Justin Verlander . The Milwaukee Brewers’  Ryan Braun  doubled to score the San Francisco Giants’ Melky Cabrera
for the first run, three more came home on a triple by Giants
teammate Pablo Sandoval and the Atlanta Braves’ Dan Uggla scored
Sandoval with a single.  Cabrera added a fourth-inning home run and was selected as
the game’s Most Valuable Player, while NL pitchers combined to
allow six American League hits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
