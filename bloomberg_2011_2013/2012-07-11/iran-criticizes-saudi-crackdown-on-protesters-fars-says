Iran ’s Foreign Ministry condemned
Saudi Arabia’s crackdown on protesters in its oil-rich  Eastern
Province  after Saudi security forces arrested dissident Shiite
cleric Nimr al-Nimr in the al-Qatif area, the state-run  Fars 
news agency reported.  Shiite-led Iran is “concerned by violent actions carried
out by the Saudi forces against religious figures and people,”
Foreign Ministry spokesman  Ramin Mehmanparast  was quoted as
saying yesterday. Saudi officials must respond to “the
legitimate demands of the public and refrain from using violence
against people,” he said, according to the report.  Security forces shot and injured al-Nimr during clashes
with his supporters in the village of Awwamiya as he tried to
escape, the Riyadh-based Saudi Press Agency said on July 8,
citing Interior Ministry spokesman Major General Mansour al-
Turki. Al-Nimr was taken to a hospital, it said.  While Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia largely escaped the
unrest that spread across the Arab world last year, minority
Shiite demonstrators have clashed this year with security forces
in Awwamiya, al-Qatif and other eastern towns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
