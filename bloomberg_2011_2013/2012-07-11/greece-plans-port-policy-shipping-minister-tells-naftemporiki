Greece ’s government will center
state-asset-sale plans for the country’s ports on securing
growth and job creation,  Naftemporiki  said, citing Shipping
Minister Konstantinos Mousouroulis.  Greece will seek investors to run commercial activities at
 Piraeus Port Authority SA (PPA)  and  Thessaloniki Port Authority SA (OLTH) ,
the country’s two biggest ports, Mousouroulis said in an
interview published in the Athens-based newspaper today.  A National Port Policy framework is planned for other ports
and strategic privatization plans will be developed where there
is investor interest, Mousouroulis told Naftemporiki. Some
smaller and regional ports will be merged and placed under
private management, the newspaper said.  Mousouroulis said value-added tax for coastal shipping may
be brought to the same levels with the rate for the tourism
sector and bureaucracy for Greek ship registration, which 
currently requires 32 signatures per vessel, will be reduced, 
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
