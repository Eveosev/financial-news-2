TMX Group Inc.’s takeover by a group
of Canadian banks and pension funds has been accepted by
regulators in British Columbia and Alberta, clearing the final
regulatory hurdles for the C$3.73 billion ($3.66 billion)
transaction.  Maple Group Acquisition Corp., whose dozen members include
 Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and
 Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , received approvals today from the
 British Columbia Securities Commission  and the Alberta
Securities Commission for final rules that allow it to operate
an exchange.  Maple said in a statement that it agreed to the terms by
the regulators, which include guarantees that 25 percent of the
TMX board will have expertise with small companies and
maintaining a Vancouver office.  Maple’s transaction will combine Canada’s main stock
markets -- the Toronto Stock Exchange,  TSX Venture Exchange  and
Alpha Exchange -- along with the Montreal Exchange derivatives
bourse and the Canadian Depository for Securities Ltd. clearing
house under one company.  Maple seeks to acquire 70 to 80 percent of TMX shares for
C$50 a share in a tender offer that expires July 31. The group
ultimately intends to buy 100 percent of TMX and integrate it
with CDS and bank-owned Alpha Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
