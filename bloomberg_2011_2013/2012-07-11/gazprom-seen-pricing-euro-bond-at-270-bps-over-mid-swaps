OAO Gazprom, the world’s largest gas
producer, is selling 750 million euros ($918 million) of five-
year bonds at 270 basis points over mid-swaps, according to a
banker with knowledge of the transaction.  Gazprom is also selling $1 billion of 10-year dollar bonds
priced to yield 4.95 percent, the banker said. JPMorgan Chase &
Co.,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  and OAO Gazprombank are organizing the
sale, said the banker, who asked not to be identified because
details of the sale weren’t public.  The gas producer’s 2017 euro-denominated bonds yield 3.842
percent, down from 5.283 percent at the start of the year and
two basis points off a July 9 record low of 3.8203 percent. The
company’s $1.3 billion of dollar debt due in March 2022 yielded
a record low 4.933 percent today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s down from 6.255 percent at the start of the
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
