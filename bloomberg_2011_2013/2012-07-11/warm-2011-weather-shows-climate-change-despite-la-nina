Last year was among the 15 warmest
since record keeping began in the late 19th century, despite a
La Nina weather pattern that should have cooled global
temperatures, according to an annual climate assessment.  La Nina’s failure to cause significantly cooler global
temperatures is one of many indications of long-term climate
warming, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration’s  State of the Climate  report compiled by 378
scientists from 48 nations. La Nina was responsible for droughts
in eastern Africa and  North America , the scientists reported.  Last year “will be remembered as a year of extreme events,
both in the  United States  and around the world,” Deputy NOAA
Administrator Kathryn D. Sullivan said in a  statement  today.
“Every weather event that happens now takes place in the
context of a changing global environment.”  Texas  had the hottest summer since data collection began in
1895 and extreme heat may be more common in the future.  “Conditions leading to droughts such as the one that
occurred in Texas in 2011 are, at least in the case of
temperature, distinctly more probable than they were 40-50 years
ago,” according to the study. It used as a proxy 2008, another
La Nina year, in which it found extreme heat was about 20 times
more likely than in the 1960s.  Thailand’s 2011 floods weren’t the result of  climate change 
because the amount of rain that fell “was not very unusual,”
the report concluded.  Carbon dioxide emissions increased in 2011 and the yearly
global average surpassed 390 parts per million for the first
time since records started.  To contact the reporter on this story:
