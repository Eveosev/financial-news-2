South African business confidence
rose from a nine-year low in June as manufacturing output and
exports increased while  inflation  slowed, the Chamber of
Commerce and Industry said.  The  business confidence index  gained for the first time in
four months to 94.9 from 92.8 in May, the Johannesburg-based
chamber said in an e-mailed statement today. The index is
compiled from 13 economic indicators, eight of which improved in
June from the previous month.  The debt crisis in  Europe  has curbed export demand from a
region that buys about a third of South  Africa ’s manufactured
goods, undermining business sentiment. Growth in Africa’s
biggest  economy  eased to an annualized 2.7 percent in the first
quarter from 3.2 percent in the previous three months as mining
output slumped and retail sales growth slowed.  The recovery in confidence “may still be tested given the
uncertain global economic situation as well as socio-political
and economic circumstances in  South Africa ,” the chamber said.  Inflation slowed to 5.7 percent in May from 6.1 percent a
month earlier, giving the central bank room to cut borrowing
costs as economic growth slows. The bank aims to keep inflation
within a range of 3 percent to 6 percent.  Manufacturing, which makes up 15 percent of the economy,
rose 1.2 percent in April from a year earlier, rebounding from a
contraction of 2.9 percent in March, the statistics office said
on June 7.  “The need for market-driven private sector fixed
investment from local as well as foreign investors remains
vital,” the chamber said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
