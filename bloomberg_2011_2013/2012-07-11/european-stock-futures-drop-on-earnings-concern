Most European stocks fell before the
release of minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting, as
investors waited for clues about further measures to spur
economic growth.  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY)  tumbled to its lowest this year after
quarterly sales growth missed projections. UniCredit SpA and BNP
Paribas SA led bank shares higher.  Getinge AB (GETIB)  rose 3.9 percent
after saying it expects “significant improvement” in second-
half earnings growth.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped less than 0.1 percent to
255.59 at the close of trading. Two out of three shares on the
gauge slid. The benchmark measure yesterday rose for the first
time in a week as manufacturing in the U.K. and Italy
unexpectedly rose.  The Fed will release the minutes of the June meeting at 2
p.m. in Washington. The  Federal Open Market Committee  said on
June 20 it will expand its Operation Twist program to extend the
maturities of assets on its balance sheet.  “All eyes are now on the FOMC minutes, in the hope that
the Fed is ready to take further steps to prop up the  U.S.
economy ,” said Stephane Ekolo, chief  European (SXXP)  strategist at
Market Securities in London. “There is no clear direction in
the market and the main catalyst is definitely the FOMC
minutes.”  National benchmark indexes fell in 11 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose less than 0.1
percent. France’s CAC 40 lost 0.6 percent, while Germany’s DAX
gained 0.2 percent.  European Earnings  Companies in the Stoxx 600 will earn 23.95 euros a share in
fiscal 2012, according to analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The projections have been cut from more than 25 euros
a share at the start of the year, the data show.  “We are cautious, but in some cases, the negative results
are priced in,” said Benoit de Broissia, a Paris-based analyst
at KBL Richelieu Gestion, which oversees about $3.4 billion.
“Globally, excluding a prolonged recession, stocks aren’t
expensive. But, there’s a lot of uncertainty.”  In the U.S., profits for  S&P 500 companies  fell 1.8 percent
in the second quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. That would be the first decline since 2009, even
as revenue is forecast to rise 2.5 percent. Analysts project
profit growth of 3.9 percent and 15 percent, respectively, in
the third and fourth quarters of 2012.  Luxury Goods  Burberry Group, the U.K.’s largest  luxury-goods  maker,
declined 7.4 percent to 1,189 pence, its lowest this year. The
company reported a slowdown in first-quarter sales growth that
trailed analysts’ estimates as revenue from its licensing
business fell, signaling a possible slowdown for the industry.  Tod’s SpA (TOD) , the Italian maker of pink alligator loafers,
lost 4.8 percent to 72.15 euros.  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA (MC) , the world’s biggest luxury-goods company, fell 3.2
percent to 116.65 euros.  PPR (PP)  SA, the French owner of Gucci,
retreated 3.5 percent to 109.50 euros.  Britvic, the maker of Robinsons fruit drinks, plunged 13
percent to 260.1 pence, the biggest drop since March 2006, after
saying full-year results will be “at the bottom end” of
analysts’ estimates and a recall of its Fruit Shoot products
will hurt earnings further.  SBM Offshore NV (SBMO)  slid 6.6 percent to 10.47 euros. SBM’s
jack-up rig in the Yme oilfield in the North Sea was evacuated
after cracks were found in cement supporting the legs, Upstream
reported late yesterday.  Mediaset SpA (MS)  retreated 3.3 percent to 1.31 euros. The
broadcaster controlled by former Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  was cut to  sell  from hold at  Societe Generale .  A gauge of bank shares gained 0.7 percent for the third-
best performance among the 19  industry groups  in the Stoxx 600.
UniCredit climbed 2.3 percent to 2.79 euros. BNP Paribas
advanced 1.5 percent to 29.94 euros.  Getinge, a Swedish sterilization-systems maker, rose 3.9
percent to 179.90 kronor. The company said the earnings outlook
for 2012 remained favorable as there will be a significant
improvement in profit growth in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
