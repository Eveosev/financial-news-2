The  Dollar Index (DXY)  may gain to a two-
year high regardless of speculation the  Federal Reserve  will
provide more stimulus, according to Bank of America Corp.  If the gauge rises above 83.54, the June 1 high, it will
strengthen to as much as 85.32, the 78.6 percent Fibonacci
 retracement  of a two-year decline that began in June 2010,
 MacNeil Curry , head of foreign-exchange and interest-rates
technical strategy at the firm, said in an interview. A decline
below 83 would suggest the rally was stalling, and a drop to
80.73 would negate it, New-York based Curry said.  The index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses to
track the U.S. currency against those of six major U.S. trading
partners, was little changed at 83.38 at 1:24 p.m. New York
time. The Fed was scheduled to release minutes of its June 20
meeting at 2 p.m. The dollar weakened against currencies of
commodity-exporting nations as investors bet the minutes would
show the central bank was moving closer to adding more stimulus.  “This is a yearlong bull trend, so even if it doesn’t
happen today because there is some issue with the Fed minutes,
it would only be a continuation of the range we’ve been in since
June,” Curry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
