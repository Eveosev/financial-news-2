China’s stocks  rallied from a six-
month low as speculation the government will boost investments
to bolster the economy overshadowed signs slowing growth is
damping corporate earnings.  China Railway Erju Co. (600528)  and Anhui Conch Cement Co. led
advances among infrastructure-related stocks after Premier  Wen Jiabao  said promoting “reasonable” growth in investment is
important. Health-care and consumer-staples stocks gained the
most among the CSI 300 Index’s industry groups as investors
bought shares of companies least tied to economic growth.  China
Southern Airlines Co. (600029)  lost 2.2 percent after saying first-half
profit may have dropped more than 50 percent.  “The earnings outlook is pretty bleak and it looks like
there’s more room to further cut estimates,” Dai Ming,  fund
manager  at Shanghai Kingsun Investment Management & Consulting
Co., said by phone. “But we shouldn’t be too pessimistic at
this level as the government may release pro-growth measures.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  advanced 0.5 percent to
2,175.38 at the close, snapping a two-day, 2.7 percent drop.
Seven stocks gained for every two that fell in the gauge, which
turned between gains and losses at least 11 times. The  CSI 300
Index (SHSZ300)  climbed 0.8 percent to 2,425.57. The  Bloomberg China-US 55
Index (CH55BN) , which tracks the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese
companies, lost 1.8 percent yesterday.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai index was at 15.8
today, compared with this year’s average of 18.1. About 5.9
billion shares changed hands in the gauge yesterday, 31 percent
lower than the daily average this year.  Lower Valuation  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 1.1 percent this year,
reversing a gain of as much as 12 percent, and closed yesterday
at the  lowest level  since Jan. 6 amid concern the government
isn’t doing enough to stem an economic slowdown. It trades at
9.6 times estimated profit, compared with the 17.6 average since
Bloomberg began compiling the  data  in 2006.  The index’s 14-day  relative strength index , which measures
how rapidly prices have advanced or dropped during a specified
time period, was at 30.3 yesterday. Readings below 30 indicate
it may be poised to rise.  China  Railway Erju, a rail construction company, jumped 5.9
percent to 6.50  yuan , its biggest gain since May 28. Anhui
Conch, China’s biggest cement maker, climbed 2.8 percent to
14.53 yuan.  Citic Heavy Industries Co. (601608) , the heavy machinery unit
of China’s largest conglomerate, surged 6 percent to 4.44 yuan,
the biggest advance since its listing on the  Shanghai Stock
Exchange  on July 6.  Boost Investment  Premier Wen said the country needs to maintain “a certain
amount” of economic growth, according to a State Council
statement posted on the central government’s website yesterday.
He called for private investments in railway, public utilities,
energy and telecommunication companies, health care and
education.  China’s policy is likely to focus on investment, Deutsche
Bank AG said in a note yesterday. The downside risk to the
nation’s economy is a sharp deceleration in infrastructure
fixed-asset investment rather than export growth,  Jun Ma , chief
economist Deutsche Bank, wrote in the note.  The People’s Bank of China may release June figures for new
lending and  money supply  as early as today. New loans rose to
880 billion yuan ($138.3 billion) from 793.2 billion yuan a
month earlier, while the broader money supply rebounded to 13.5
percent from 13.2 percent in May, according to the median
estimate of Bloomberg surveys.  Slowing Trade  A statistics bureau report on July 13 is expected to show
 China’s economy  expanded 7.7 percent in the second quarter, the
slowest pace in three years, according to the median estimate of
35 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Data yesterday showed Chinese imports in June grew 6.3
percent, below the 11 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 32 economists.  Export growth  also slowed from
May, putting the government further at risk of missing its goal
of 10 percent growth in trade this year. The government said on
July 9 the annual inflation rate fell to 2.2 percent in June,
the slowest pace in more than two years.  Gauges tracking pharmaceutical and consumer-staples stocks
climbed 2.9 percent and 2.3 percent respectively today, the most
among the CSI 300’s 10 industry groups.  Yunnan Baiyao Group Co., a manufacturer of traditional
Chinese medicines, rose 5.3 percent to 62.77 yuan.  Kweichow
Moutai Co. (600519) , China’s biggest producer of baijiu liquor by market
value, added 3 percent to 258.01 yuan.  Net incomes for consumer-goods companies in the CSI 300
rose 26 percent from a year earlier in the first quarter,
compared with a 6.7 percent gain in earnings for the all 300
companies in the CSI 300 in the period, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings Concern  Publicly traded Chinese companies release their interim
earnings reports in July and August. The companies in the
Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are expected to post a 4.2
percent decline in second-quarter profit, according to Haitong
Securities Co.  China Southern, the nation’s biggest carrier by fleet size,
lost 2.2 percent to 4.54 yuan. First-half profit probably
dropped from a year earlier because of slowing economic growth
and higher jet-fuel prices, the carrier said in a statement
yesterday. The Chinese currency’s decline against the  U.S.
dollar  also caused foreign-exchange losses, it said.  Luolai Home Textile Co. (002293) , China’s biggest manufacturer of
home textile products, slumped by the 10 percent daily limit to
64.70 yuan, its biggest decline since its first trading day on
the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in September 2009.  First-half  profit  probably dropped as much as 30 percent
from a year earlier because of lower sales and increased costs,
the company said in a statement yesterday. That compared with an
April estimate of an increase of as much as 30 percent.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slid 1.9 percent to $32.43
yesterday. The ETF dropped for a fourth day, the longest period
of losses since May.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Darren Boey, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
