Tessenderlo Chemie NV (TESB)  and
 Wienerberger AG (WIE)  units were among the makers of plastic sewage
pipes and fittings raided by European Union antitrust regulators
last month.  The European Commission said it made surprise visits to
companies in several countries over concerns they violated
antitrust rules that forbid price-fixing agreements. It didn’t
identify the companies.  Tessenderlo’s plastic-fittings unit, Nyloplast Europe, was
one of the companies inspected, said Ingvild Van Lysebetten, a
spokeswoman for the Brussels-based company. Wienerberger’s
Pipelife unit was also visited by EU officials, according to a
company official who declined to be identified in line with the
firm’s policy.  Tessenderlo agreed to pay an 83.8 million-euro ($102.6
million) fine in 2010 to settle an EU probe over price fixing
for animal-feed phosphates. Regulators can fine companies as
much as 10 percent of annual sales for colluding with
competitors.  Wienerberger, the world’s largest brick maker, bought the
50 percent stake in Pipelife it didn’t already own from  Solvay
SA (SOLB)  for 162 million euros in February. Wienerberger has been
fully consolidating the unit since June 1. Pipelife produces
plastic pipes, pipe systems and plastic dies and operates 27
plants in Europe and the U.S. The company had sales of 804.5
million euros last year.  Uponor Oyj (UNR1V)  of Finland and  Teraplast SA (TRP)  of Romania both said
they weren’t visited. Georg Fischer Piping Systems of
Switzerland said it doesn’t make products for sewage use and
wasn’t raided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
