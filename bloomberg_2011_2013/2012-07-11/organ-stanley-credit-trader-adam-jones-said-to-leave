Morgan Stanley (MS)  senior credit-
derivatives trader  Adam Jones  left the bank amid reductions in
his division, said people briefed on the decision.  Jones, a managing director at the bank, was the lead trader
for single-name correlation products, said one of the people,
who requested anonymity because the move wasn’t public. Jones
didn’t return a call to his mobile phone seeking comment.  Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 54, said last year that
the firm was planning to cut assets within correlation trading.
Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, is
eliminating fewer than 100 jobs as Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis crimps trading and deal volume, people briefed on the
plans said this week.  Colm Kelleher, 55, who runs the New York-based company’s
trading business, said in December that much of what was called
correlation trading has disappeared and the bank was focused on
moving people to other units.  To contact the reporters on this story:
