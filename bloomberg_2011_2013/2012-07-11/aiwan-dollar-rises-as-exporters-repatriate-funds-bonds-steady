Taiwan ’s dollar rose on speculation
exporters are taking advantage of a four-day loss to convert
overseas earnings at a more favorable exchange rate.  Government
bonds  were little changed.  “It’s mainly exporters selling the greenback,” said
Tarsicio Tong, a foreign-exchange trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan (2838) 
in Taipei. “Concerns over Taiwan growth will continue to add
depreciation pressure on the currency.”  The  Taiwan dollar  earlier touched its weakest level in more
than a month as  stock indexes  across Asia dropped today. The
island’s exports contracted for a fourth month in June, adding
to speculation Europe’s lingering debt crisis is crimping
demand. Global funds sold $346 million more Taiwanese shares
than they bought in the last two days, according to exchange
data.  The currency climbed 0.04 percent to NT$29.974 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It reached
NT$30.030, the weakest level since June 5. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of  exchange-rate  swings used to price
options, fell 13 basis points to 3.67 percent.  Overseas shipments fell 3.2 percent in June from a year
earlier, after declining 6.3 percent in May, official data
showed on July 9. Exports from China rose 11.3 percent last
month, slowing from 15.3 percent in May, according to a
government report yesterday.  The yield on the 1.25 percent Taiwanese government bonds
due March 2022 was at 1.185 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. That’s the lowest level for the  benchmark  10-
year yield since June 12.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.509 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
