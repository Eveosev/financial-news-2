VTB Group declined to the lowest in
almost two weeks after UBS AG added Russia’s second-largest
lender to its list of least-preferred stocks, citing the bank’s
reliance on income from trading.  VTB shares retreated as much as 3.7 percent before closing
down 3 percent to 5.54 kopeks in Moscow, the lowest level since
June 28. The  Micex Index (VTBMICX)  dropped 1.2 percent to 1,405.15.  “We add VTB to the least-preferred list given its reliance
on trading income, which has historically been volatile and is
set to decline in the second quarter,” UBS analysts led by
Dmitry Vinogradov said in an e-mailed research note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
