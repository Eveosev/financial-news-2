Joao Havelange , ex-president of
soccer ruling body FIFA, and his former son-in-law  Ricardo
Teixeira  have been named in bribe-case documents linked to the
collapsed ISL marketing agency.  The Swiss Federal Court today ordered the release of the
documents, which relate to a corruption investigation involving
the two men.  The two officials had sought to block the publication of
the documents linked to a case against ISL after journalists had
requested the court papers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
