An increase in Spanish value-added
tax announced today will further depress car sales as dealers
are unlikely to be able to afford an extra cost estimated at an
average 650 euros ($798) per car, vendors group GANVAM said in
an e-mailed statement.  “The raise will be an obstacle impossible to overcome for
many dealers that are already in the red,” the Asociacion
Nacional de Vendedores de Vehiculos a Motor said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
