LDC SA (LOUP) , a French poultry processor,
may be interested in buying the fresh cut business of Doux SA,
 Le Journal du Dimanche  reported, without citing anyone.  France ’s sovereign wealth fund FSI is also ready to team up
with partners to help Doux, which sought protection from
creditors on June 1, the newspaper said. Doux, which owes 140
million euros ($174 million) to Barclays, is seeking new lenders
with the help of Lazard bankers, according to Journal du
Dimanche.  Barclays said in a statement on June 1 that it was
disappointed by Doux’s decision to seek protection from
creditors as a rescue plan was being worked out. Proposed
refinancing plans were short-term solutions that didn’t provide
enough guaranties for the group, Doux said in a  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
