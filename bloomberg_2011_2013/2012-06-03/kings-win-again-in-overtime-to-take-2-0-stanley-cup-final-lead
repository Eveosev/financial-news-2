Jeff Carter  gave the Los Angeles
Kings their second straight overtime win and a 2-0 lead against
the New Jersey Devils in the Stanley Cup Final.  Carter’s goal on a wristshot 13 minutes, 42 seconds into
overtime gave the Kings a 2-1 win, their 10th straight road
victory this postseason in the National Hockey League playoffs.  Carter took the puck at the side of the New Jersey net,
circled away and curled toward the center of the ice. He then
flipped a shot past the right skate of Devils goalie  Martin Brodeur .  “I got a loose puck and tried to get it past all those
sticks,” Carter said in a televised interview. “We
accomplished what we came to do, and we’ll go back to work in
Game 3.”  The Kings also won 2-1 in the opening game, which ended
when  Anze Kopitar  scored on a breakaway against Brodeur. This
time, Brodeur had plenty of people in front of him when Carter
took his winning shot.  “He kind of used everybody to set a screen and shoot the
puck short side,” Brodeur said. “We’re definitely in a tough
spot, but it’s not impossible.”  Drew Doughty scored the Kings’ first goal midway through
the first period.  Ryan Carter  tied the game on a tip-in three
minutes into the third period.  The series now moves to the Staples Center in Los Angeles
for Game 3 tomorrow and Game 4 two days later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
