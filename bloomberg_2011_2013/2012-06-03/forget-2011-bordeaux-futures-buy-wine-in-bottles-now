Delete. Delete. Delete. Of the 578
offers of 2011 Bordeaux futures that flooded Jamie Ritchie’s
inbox one morning, most ended up in his trash file.  In mid-May, after doing practically nothing in the weeks
that followed Chateau Lafite’s release of its en primeur price
at 420 euros ($519) a bottle on April 16, (a 30 percent dip from
2010), thumb-sucking chateaux suddenly rushed en masse with
their own offerings. Major players, like Ducru-Beaucaillou,
still haven’t.  “All the merchants wanted a fast and well-priced campaign
and we didn’t get one,” says Ritchie, president and chief
executive officer of Sotheby’s Wine in  New York , including its
retail shop.  But didn’t the chateaux, including the famous first
growths, reduce their prices this year? Yes, but discounts
averaged just 15.81 percent off expensive 2010, according to
U.K.-based Farr Vintners’ May 25 final Bordeaux report.  Most offers weren’t nearly enticing enough to kick start
demand for a vintage that is very good but certainly not great
like the 2010 and 2009.  Considering you can find older, ready-to-drink comparable
vintages already in the bottle for similar prices, there’s
little reason to buy now.  Consumer Apathy  “Customers are walking away in complete apathy,” says
Gary Boom, head of London merchant  Bordeaux Index , who expects
to move only 10 to 15 percent of the wine he sold last year.  Still, with the 2011 Lafite cheaper than any of its
previous vintages on the market, he’s managed to sell more than
100 cases at 5,500 pounds each in  Asia .  Simon Staples , global sales and marketing director for
London-based  Berry Bros & Rudd  bemoaned Bordeaux’s messy
schedule. On “Super Tuesday” May 15, more than 40 chateaux
released, followed by another rush on “Wacky Wednesday.” On some
days so many different prices were released that offers got lost
in the flurry, he says.  He had just landed in  Tokyo  when I reached him. “We sold
105 million pounds-worth of 2009 futures, 72 million of 2010,
and we’ll be lucky to sell 30 million of 2011,” he said in an
e-mail.  Buying wines as futures while they’re still in barrel,
known as en primeur, used to be considered the way to obtain top
Bordeaux at the lowest cost. That’s no longer guaranteed.  Older, Cheaper  En primeur updates on  Farr Vintners ’ website provided
plenty of proof. “Rauzan-Segla 600 pounds -- a very good 2011
but the 2008 is available at 420 pounds, so what’s the point?”
it says in one commentary. Another example: “Cheval Blanc is
delicious in 2011, but for 4,500 pounds you can buy the
magnificent 1998.”  If wines don’t sell, they may be discounted later in the
summer. One merchant, who didn’t want to be named, reported that
within hours of Cos d’Estournel’s release ex-chateau at 108
euros a bottle, negociants were offering 10 percent off.  The half-dozen merchants I spoke with in the U.S. and U.K.
are buying far fewer wines than they did in 2009 and 2010. Clyde
Beffa, owner of San Francisco Bay Area  K & L Wine Merchants ,
lauded “semi-reasonable” prices of La Mission Haut Brion
(2010, 600 euros; 2011, 219 euros) and Margaux (2010, 600 euros;
2011, 350 euros), yet questioned the wisdom of having a futures
campaign at all this year.  Seller Skepticism  Daniel Posner, owner of  Grapes the Wine Company  in  White
Plains , New York was equally skeptical. He’s been saying to
customers, “I’ll get them if you want them, but I don’t know
why you do.”  Neither do I. The main reason for buying 2011 wines as
futures now is to get your hands on scarce, sought-after
bottlings produced in tiny quantities, like the stunning Pomerol
Vieux Chateau Certan. That estate hasn’t yet released a price,
but for comparison its 2008 goes for about $140.  I’d also single out vibrant, layered 2011 Pontet-Canet,
selling at $110. That’s cheaper than the current price of the
2008 and the wine is much, much better, thanks to biodynamic
vineyard practices. Another good 2011 buy is Calon-Segur
($67.50). Still, there’s no need to rush as there is plenty of
both available.  Sweet Sauternes are terrific in 2011. A top-value buy is
the rich, superb Chateau Raymond-Lafon ($40). Harmonious  Chateau
Suduiraut  ($69) and lemony, bright Coutet ($68) are stunning,
but be aware that you can buy older fine vintages at auction for
less.  Last Latour  Given Chateau Latour’s announcement that its intense,
compelling 2011 will be the last vintage to be offered en
primeur, it might be worth buying.  The release price of 450 euros a bottle translates into
4,800 pounds a case at Farr Vintners (700 pounds less than 2008)
and $700 a bottle at New York’s Sherry-Lehmann. Typically the
chateau only releases a tiny amount at the opening price, so it
might increase quickly.  With Bordeaux’s high prices maybe this is the time to make
your very own luxury-class Bordeaux instead.  Crushpad  Bordeaux,
a do-it-yourself consumer winemaking operation (an outpost of
the Sonoma-based company), is teaming up with Chateau Lynch-
Bages to establish a winery near Pauillac. The facility will be
up and running in time for the 2012 harvest.  Would-be winemakers will have access to Lynch-Bages’s team
and famed consultant Eric Boissenot, who advises the first
growths. The cost per barrel (25 cases) to make your own at
Crushpad?  A mere 6,900 to 10,500 euros, way less than the cost
of two cases of 2011 Latour or Lafite.  ( Elin McCoy  writes on wine and spirits for Muse, the arts
