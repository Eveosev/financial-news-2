Federal Reserve Bank of  Minneapolis 
President Narayana Kocherlakota said policy makers should use
prices in financial markets to help form their outlook.  “Policy makers can achieve better outcomes by basing their
outlooks on risk-neutral probabilities derived from the prices
of financial derivatives,” Kocherlakota said in remarks
prepared for a speech today in Minneapolis. “Because they are
derived from market prices, risk-neutral probabilities provide
the needed information about the relative values of resources in
different states of the world in a way that purely statistical
forecasts cannot.”  The Minneapolis Fed chief, who isn’t a voting member of the
policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year, was
speaking to the Financial Intermediation Research Society
Conference. He did not comment on the  U.S. economy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
