Switzerland’s tax issues have “short
and medium-term negative impact” on new client money,  Der
Sonntag  reported, citing Hans-Ulrich Meister, the head of  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ’s private banking business.  Still, the inflow of 5.8 billion Swiss francs ($6 billion)
in the first quarter is “not the new standard,” Meister told
the Swiss newspaper. The year-earlier figure was 12 billion
francs, according to Der Sonntag.  “Client activities will be negatively affected for as long
as the problems in  Europe  are not convincingly solved,” the
newspaper reported, citing Meister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
