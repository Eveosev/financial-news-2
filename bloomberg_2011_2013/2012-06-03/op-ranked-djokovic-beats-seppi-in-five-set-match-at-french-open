Women’s top seed  Victoria Azarenka 
was knocked out of the  French Open  today, while men’s No. 1
Novak Djokovic and 2009 champion  Roger Federer  both struggled
before reaching the quarterfinals.  Azarenka lost to No. 15 seed Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia
6-2, 7-6 (7-4) on Court Suzanne Lenglen on a cold and windy day
at Roland Garros.  “Right now I’m just really, really unhappy with the way I
played,” Azarenka told reporters. “I’m going to look for what
I did wrong to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” said the
Belarussian, who had smashed her racket on the clay early on in
the second set.  Azarenka, who became No. 1 in January after winning her
first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open, struggled to find
her early season form in Paris, coming to within two games in
her opening round of becoming the first female top seed to lose
at that stage at Roland Garros. She began 2012 on a win streak
of 26 matches, the longest to start the season since  Martina Hingis  of Switzerland in 1997.  “In the tiebreak I’m very, very proud of myself that I was
still going for my shots, and I just made it because she would
never give me the match,” said Cibulkova, who struck 28 winners
while Azarenka had 19.  Over on the main Court Philippe Chatrier, Djokovic fought
back from two sets down for only the third time in his career to
beat Italy’s Andreas Seppi, 4-6, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 7-5, 6-3.  ‘Played Terrible’  “It was obvious he played well and I played terrible,”
Djokovic said in a televised interview after the match. The Serb
converted only 9 out of 22 breakpoints, while Seppi made six of
10. Djokovic plays either  Switzerland ’s Stanislas Wawrinka or
France’s Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarterfinals.  Federer, a 16-time major winner from Switzerland, overcame
a challenge by David Goffin, the first lucky loser into the last
sixteen of a major since fellow Belgian Dick Norman at Wimbledon
in 1995. The 21-year-old, playing in his first major, used to
have posters of the Swiss on his wall as he was growing up.  The third-seeded Federer beat the 109th-ranked Goffin, 5-7,
7-5, 6-2, 6-4 to move to his 32nd straight Grand Slam
quarterfinal, where he’ll play the winner of the match between
former Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic
and 2009 U.S. Open winner Juan Martin del Potro of  Argentina .  Djokovic Target  Serbia’s Djokovic, 25, is trying to win his fourth straight
major title to complete a non-calendar Grand Slam. The last man
to do so is  Australia ’s  Rod Laver , who swept the titles in 1969.
Laver, who also achieved the feat in 1962, and American  Don Budge  in 1938 are the only men to win four in a row in one
calendar year.  Earlier today,  Svetlana Kuznetsova , the 2009 champion from
Russia, lost to Italy’s Sara Errani, 6-0, 7-5.  U.S. Open champion Samantha Stosur of Australia, a finalist
in Paris in 2010, plays American teenager  Sloane Stephens .  Stephens, 19, is one of two unseeded American women into
the fourth round of a major for the first time since 2002 at
Wimbledon. Yesterday,  Varvara Lepchenko  of the U.S. upset 2010
winner Francesca Schiavone in three sets. No American men
reached the third round in Paris this year, the worst result
since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
