Manchester City manager  Roberto
Mancini  wants to bolster the Premier League champion’s defense
with a move for Newcastle center-back Fabricio Coloccini, the
People reported.  Coloccini signed a new contract at Newcastle this year, but
City hopes the opportunity to play in European soccer’s
Champions League and a 75,000 pounds-a-week salary may tempt him
to join, the newspaper said, without citing anyone.  City would need to pay about 8 million pounds ($12.3
million) for the 30-year-old, the newspaper reported.
Liverpool’s Daniel Agger and Chelsea’s David Luiz are
alternative targets, the People said.  City also wants to sign winger Matias Rodriguez from
Universidad de Chile and may move for Bologna midfielder Gaston
Ramirez, the newspaper reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
