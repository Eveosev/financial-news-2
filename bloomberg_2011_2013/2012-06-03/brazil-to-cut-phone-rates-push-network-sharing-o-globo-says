Brazil’s planned telecommunications
rate cuts designed to help stimulate economic growth will reduce
companies’ revenue, Communications Minister  Paulo Bernardo  told
O Globo newspaper.  Under new rules to take effect in September, more calls
will be charged at local, rather than long-distance, rates,
which will cut annual revenue to companies by 300 million reais
($147 million), Bernardo said in an interview with the Rio de
Janeiro-based daily.  Companies also will have to lease excess network capacity
to other operators as a way to heighten competition, Bernardo
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
