German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler is putting pressure on  General Motors Co. (GM)  to clarify its
plans for its Adam Opel GmbH unit,  Der Spiegel  magazine
reported, citing an interview.  The management of Russelsheim-based Opel fear that a plan
of GM to focus development of new models from its Detroit
headquarters will hurt Opel sales in  Europe , where car buyers’
demands differ from their U.S. counterparts, according to the
magazine.  Roesler’s request to meet GM management on a trip to the
U.S. this month has gone unanswered, according to Spiegel.
“This unworthy theater has to stop now -- Opel’s workforce
needs clarity,” Roesler is cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
