Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , the world’s
second-biggest maker of personal computers, may transfer some
production to its  Medion AG (MDN)  unit in Soemmerda, in the eastern
German state of Thueringia,  Euro am Sonntag  reported.  Lenovo will decide by the summer whether to open its own
production lines at the Medion plant, the company’s European,
Middle-East and Africa President Gianfranco Lanci said in an
interview. The site, acquired when Lenovo bought Medion last
year, offers expansion possibilities and in cost terms is “very
competitive,” Lanci is cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
