Japanese and Australian  stock futures 
fell after a U.S. payrolls report showed fewer jobs were added
to the world’s largest economy than the most pessimistic
forecast, adding to concern the global economy is slowing.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , a Japanese
exporter of consumer electronics that gets about one fifth of
its sales in the U.S., fell 2.3 percent from the closing share
price in Tokyo. ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest
mining company, dropped 0.6 percent as metals prices declined.
Those of  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s second-largest oil
producer, sank 1.5 percent as crude extended last week’s slump.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring this
month closed at 8,255 in  Chicago  on June 1, down from 8,420 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,250 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index dropped 1.4 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid
1 percent in Wellington.  “The poor U.S. payrolls number should start to deflate
investor optimism about U.S. growth that we’ve encountered,
leaving few places for investors to hide,” said  Gerard Minack ,
global developed-market strategist at Morgan Stanley in Sydney.  U.S. payrolls climbed by 69,000 last month and the jobless
rate rose to 8.2 percent. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s
factory index fell after reaching a 10-month high.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.4 percent
today. The index slumped 2.5 percent in New York June 1 and the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  erased its 2012 gains after the
jobs report.  Monthly Loss  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  tumbled 10 percent in May, the
biggest monthly loss since October 2008, when global markets
tumbled in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brother Holdings
Inc. Equities continued declines into June amid concern growth
is slowing in China and Europe’s debt crisis is worsening. This
dragged valuations on the Asian benchmark down to 11.4 times
 estimated earnings  on average through June 1, compared with 12.2
times for the S&P 500 and 9.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  China’s non-manufacturing industries expanded at the
slowest pace in more than a year as export orders declined and
weakness in real estate countered strength in retailing and
leasing, an official survey indicated.  The  purchasing managers’ index  fell to 55.2 in May from
56.1 in April, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said in statements
yesterday in Beijing. That’s the lowest reading since March 2011
when the federation started seasonally adjusting the data.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. tumbled 3.4 percent to 87.22 on
June 1 in  New York , the biggest slump since Nov. 21.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum dropped 0.8
percent on June 1 and the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of
raw materials slumped 1.7 percent.  Oil for July delivery opened 0.3 percent lower in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after
falling 8.4 percent last week to the lowest in eight months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
