Newstrike Capital Inc. (NES) , a gold
explorer backed by Sweden’s oil and mining Lundin family, may
seek a secondary listing in London, the Independent on Sunday
 said , citing Chief Executive Officer Richard Whittall.  A listing in London “would possibly make infinite sense”
for the Toronto-listed miner, Whittall was quoted as saying.
Newstrike was already approached to join Hong Kong’s stock
exchange, the newspaper said, without saying where it got the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
