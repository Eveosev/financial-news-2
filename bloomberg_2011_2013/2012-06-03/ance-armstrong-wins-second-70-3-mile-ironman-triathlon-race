Lance Armstrong , the seven-time Tour
de  France  cycling champion, claimed his second Half Ironman
triathlon title in two weeks by breaking the course record on
the Kohala Coast in  Hawaii  by six minutes.  The 70.3-mile (113-kilometer) event two days ago was the
fifth triathlon this year for the 40-year-old Armstrong, who is
seeking to qualify for the Ironman World Championship after
retiring from professional cycling in February 2011.  Armstrong  finished in a time  of 3 hours, 50 minutes and 55
seconds, more than 2 1/2 minutes ahead of runner-up Greg Bennett
to break Chris McCormack’s course record. Armstrong said it was
more challenging than his previous Half Ironman in  Florida  on
May 20, a race he won by more than 11 minutes.  “It was harder than I expected,” Armstrong told
reporters. “The winds on the bike were one thing, but the run
was painful with the ups and downs and the different surfaces.”  Armstrong, who competed as a professional triathlete at age
18 before focusing on cycling, completed the 1.2-mile swim in
23:22, placing him third. He moved into the lead after covering
the 56-mile bike ride in 2:01:46 and sealed the win by running
13.1 miles in 1:22:30.  Bennett and Chris Lieto, both Americans, were second and
third in 3:53:41 and 4:05:55 respectively.  Armstrong, who won the  Tour de France  each year from 1999
to 2005, is scheduled to race a 140.6-mile full Ironman event
June 24 in Nice, France, in his quest to earn enough points to
qualify for the world championship in Hawaii on Oct. 13.  Armstrong finished second in his Ironman debut in  Panama  in
February and was seventh in Galveston,  Texas , in April. Last
month, he placed third in St. Croix before his Florida win.  “I’m having fun,” Armstrong said. “That tells me I’m
doing the right thing. It’s good for a lot of things. I think
it’s good for the sport. I think it’s good for the other pros.
It’s good for my foundation, it’s good for the other business
ventures I have.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
