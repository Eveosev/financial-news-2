Sinohydro Group Ltd (601669)  said it hasn’t
received any notice that Iran has canceled a dam project,
following a report in the Middle Eastern nation’s state media
saying the government had ended the $2 billion deal.  The contracts for the dam were signed on March 15 last year
and haven’t taken effect because the financing for the project
hasn’t finished, Sinohydro, the Chinese dam maker that invests
heavily overseas, said in a statement today.  Iran’s Central Bank and a governmental committee rejected
an offer from Sinohydro to build the Bakhtiari dam in
southwestern Iran, the country’s state-run news agency Merh
reported May 31, citing Energy Ministry Majid Namjou. The
project was handed to the Revolutionary Guard Corps, it said.  Chinese leaders will meet Iranian President  Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad  during a visit to China next week, the Foreign
Ministry said May 21. Iran has come under financial, trade and
energy sanctions imposed by the  United Nations , the U.S. and the
European Union as a result of its nuclear activities. China is
the biggest buyer of Iranian crude.  With 163 billion  yuan  ($26 billion) in assets, Sinohydro
was listed on the Chinese stock exchange in October.  The 315 meter high dam will have a reservoir capacity of
4.8 billion cubic meters of water, enough for a 1,500 megawatt
hydroelectric power station, Mehr reported.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
