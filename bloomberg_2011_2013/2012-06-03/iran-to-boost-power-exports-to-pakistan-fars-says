Iran  signed an agreement with
 Pakistan  to increase electricity exports to its eastern neighbor
to 1,000 megawatts, the state-run  Fars  news agency reported,
citing Iranian Deputy Energy Minister Mohammad Behzad.  The countries will build a transmission line for
electricity between the city of Zahedan in southeastern Iran and
Quetta in western Pakistan, Behzad said, according to the report
published yesterday.  The project will require an investment of $700 million and
will be jointly financed by the two countries, the official
 Islamic Republic News Agency  reported, citing a statement from
the Energy Ministry today.  Iran has doubled its power exports to Pakistan to 70
megawatts a day in the Iranian year starting March 20, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
