German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  should forego a candidacy for the job of head of the
group of euro-area finance ministers,  Bild-am-Sonntag  newspaper
cited a leader of Germany’s main opposition Social Democratic
Party as saying in an interview.  Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the former foreign minister in
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s first-term government who is the
SPD’s leader in the federal parliament, said the job should go
to a small country when the incumbent, Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , steps down.  “Germany’s dominance in European financial policy is
already too large as a result of our economic strength,”
Steinmeier was cited as saying by the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
