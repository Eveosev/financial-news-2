Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  is seeking cuts of 25 percent in the 400 million pounds
($614.5 million) a year subsidies for U.K. onshore windfarms,
the Observer said, citing unidentified sources.  “It is vital that our support for renewable electricity
both encourages investment and represents value for money for
consumers,” the newspaper cited the Department of Energy and
Climate Change as saying in a statement. “The government will
publish the new support levels shortly.”  The Treasury declined to comment, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
