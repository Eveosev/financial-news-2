Women’s top seed  Victoria Azarenka 
was ousted in the fourth round of the French Open by Slovakia’s
Dominika Cibulkova.  Australian Open champion Azarenka of Belarus lost to the
No. 15 seed, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) on the Court Suzanne Lenglen at
Roland Garros. It was the earliest defeat in a major for
Azarenka since she lost in the third round of the U.S. Open last
year. Cibulkova was a semi-finalist in Paris in 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
