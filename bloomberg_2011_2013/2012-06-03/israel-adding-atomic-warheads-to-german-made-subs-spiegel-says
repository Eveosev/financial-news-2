Israel  is arming military submarines
made in Germany by  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) ’s  HDW  GmbH unit with nuclear
warheads,  Der Spiegel  magazine reported, citing retired Defense
Ministry officials Hans Ruehle and Lothar Ruehl.  With the German government’s approval, HDW has already
delivered three submarines to Israel and a further three will be
delivered by 2017, the magazine said. The government denies all
knowledge of Israel giving the submarines a nuclear capacity,
