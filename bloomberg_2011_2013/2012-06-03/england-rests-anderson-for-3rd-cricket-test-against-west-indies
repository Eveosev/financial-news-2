England omitted bowler  James Anderson 
from its squad for the third cricket Test against the West
Indies, opting to “manage his workload” with a series victory
already assured.  Steven Finn or Graham Onions will replace Anderson, who is
No. 3 in the International Cricket Council’s Test bowler
rankings, for the match at Edgbaston in Birmingham starting June
7.  Anderson was left out “as we look to manage his workload
ahead of a busy period of cricket this summer and beyond, a
decision which is in the best interests of the team and James
himself,” national selector Geoff Miller said in a statement on
the England & Wales Cricket Board’s  website .  England has an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series
following a five-wicket win in the first Test and a nine-wicket
victory in the second.  It will also play three one-day internationals and a
Twenty20 match against the West Indies, before a five-match one-
day series with  Australia . England then faces  South Africa  in
three Tests starting July 19, with five one-day games and three
Twenty20 matches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
