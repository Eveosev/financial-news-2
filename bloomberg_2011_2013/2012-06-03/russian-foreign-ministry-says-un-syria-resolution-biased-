The United Nations Human Rights
Council’s resolution on  Syria  is “biased” and goes against its
May 27 statement that the circumstances of the Houla massacre
are unclear, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said on its website.  The worst atrocity in the 15-month uprising against Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad was carried out by “pro-regime
elements” and government forces, the Geneva-based rights
council said in a resolution that was passed by 41 votes on June
1. China, Russia and China voted against the resolution, which
was submitted by the U.S., Qatar and  Turkey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
