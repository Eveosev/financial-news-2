A headhunter hired to find a new
chairman for The Royal Mint Ltd. could lead to the revival of
the process to sell the company, the  Sunday Telegraph  reported,

in the Cardiff-based Mint on behalf of the Treasury, hired
Odgers Berndtson, the U.K. newspaper said, citing a candidate
brief from the headhunter. A new chairman is expected to be in
place by the end of 2012, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
