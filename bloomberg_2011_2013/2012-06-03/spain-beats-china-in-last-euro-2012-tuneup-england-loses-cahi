David Silva  scored with six minutes
left as Spain beat China 1-0 in its final tuneup before
defending its European Championship soccer title.  Silva got the breakthrough in Seville last night with his
16th goal for Spain after  Andres Iniesta  darted into the penalty
area and cut the ball back.  Spain, the bookmakers’ favorite to win Euro 2012, opens its
title defense June 10 against Italy in Gdansk, Poland before
facing the Republic of Ireland and Croatia in the same city. The
16-team tournament in Poland and Ukraine starts June 8.  England defender Gary Cahill was yesterday ruled out of the
tournament after sustaining a double fracture of his jaw in the
team’s final tuneup against Belgium two days ago. Liverpool’s
 Martin Kelly  was called up as his replacement, subject to
approval from tournament organizer UEFA.  He’s the fourth player to withdraw injured from manager Roy Hodgson’s original 23-man England squad following goalkeeper
John Ruddy and midfielders Gareth Barry and Frank Lampard.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
