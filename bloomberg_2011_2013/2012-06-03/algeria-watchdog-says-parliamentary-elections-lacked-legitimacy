Algeria ’s legislative elections last
month were “devoid of legitimacy,” the daily  Al Watan 
newspaper reported, citing the head of an independent commission
that monitored the vote.  Mohamed Seddiki, the chairman of the National Independent
Commission of Legislative Elections, said they recorded
“several violations and breaches of the electoral process,” Al
Watan reported.  The vote last month, in which the ruling party emerged with
the biggest bloc of seats, had been described by Algerian
officials as the freest and fairest in the country in decades.
Several Islamist parties criticized the results after expecting
that they would emerge the winners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
