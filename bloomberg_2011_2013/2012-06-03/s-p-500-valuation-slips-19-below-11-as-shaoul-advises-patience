The weakest U.S. hiring in 12 months
erased the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s advance for 2012 and
pushed valuations in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 19 percent
below last year’s level.  The increase in the American jobless rate to 8.2 percent in
May compounded signs that the economic recovery is stalling and
sent the  benchmark gauge for U.S. equities  down 2.5 percent to
1,278.04 on June 1, almost 37 points below its level a year
earlier. The S&P 500 is trading at 12.9 times profits in the
last 12 months, compared with 15.9 times in February 2011, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  For bears, the decline in  valuations  shows the weakest
recovery from any recession in seven decades has exhausted
buyers and signals investors expect the economy to slow further.
Bulls say buying when payroll gains slow has made money in the
past and that record  earnings  will support share prices as the
 Federal Reserve  holds rates near zero.  “You have to take your hits,” said  Michael Shaoul ,
chairman of Marketfield Asset Management in New York, whose
biggest fund oversees $1.6 billion and beat 98 percent of its
peers in the last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“You don’t let it change your mind about domestic U.S.
activity. You can be patient with U.S. economic growth and the
market, and I still keep that view after this.”  Shaoul said he’s buying stocks of U.S. companies that
depend least on overseas revenue. He’s selling short  emerging
markets , expecting further losses after the MSCI Emerging Market
Index of companies in 21 less-developed countries fell 17
percent since reaching a seven-month high on March 2.  Biggest Decline  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  posted its  biggest decline  since November on
June 1 after the Labor Department said payrolls climbed by
69,000 last month, less than the most-pessimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 87 economists. The  unemployment rate 
increased to 8.2 percent from 8.1 percent in April. The slump in
stocks followed a 6.3 percent loss in May, the biggest monthly
tumble since September.  The  stock index  rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,278.18
today. The MSCI All-Country World Index fell 0.3 percent.  More than $1.63 trillion has been erased from U.S. equity
values and $5.92 trillion from world stocks this quarter as
concern Greece will leave the euro and slowing Chinese
manufacturing pushed government bond yields in the U.S. and
 Germany  to record lows.  China PMI  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index dropped to 50.4 in May
from 53.3 in April, the statistics bureau and logistics
federation said June 1 in Beijing. German two-year note yields
fell below zero for the first time and the euro weakened to
$1.2288, a level not seen since July 2010.  A Citigroup Inc. index that plots results of American
 economic reports  against average forecasts in Bloomberg surveys
has gone from 91.9 in January to minus 53.6.  At 12.9, the  S&P 500 ’s  price-earnings ratio  is 21 percent
below its five-decade average of 16.4. It fell below the long-
term level in May 2010 and the stretch of more than 500 trading
days since then is the longest such period since the presidency
of  Richard Nixon  in the 1970s, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  While the jobless data shifted investor focus to the U.S.
after Greece and Spain dominated markets since April, the hiring
shortfall means little for profits of American companies,
according to Shaoul and Brian Barish, president and chief
investment officer of Cambiar Investors LLC, a Denver-based
institutional equities manager with $8 billion under management.  ‘Astronomical’ Aversion  “I feel like a hostage,” Barish, who has been adding to
equity positions, said in an e-mail on June 1. “I seriously do
not believe the world will end in 2012, and, heck, we are still
generating some jobs. But  risk aversion  is astronomical and
that’s just how things are.”  Earnings in the S&P 500 are forecast to reach a record
$105.81 a share in 2012 and climb 13 percent in 2013, according
to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Companies in the
index have boosted profits for more than two years. Since the
start of 2010, non-farm payrolls have declined by as much as
136,000 and increased as much as 677,000, according to quarterly
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Data on jobs followed the Commerce Department lowering its
estimate of expansion in first-quarter gross domestic product to
1.9 percent from 2.2 percent. Americans signing contracts to buy
previously owned homes fell in April by the most in a year and
companies placed fewer orders for computers and other capital
equipment, reports showed since May 24.  Market’s Peak  The S&P 500 declined 9.9 percent through last week since
reaching a four-year high of 1,419.04 on April 2, trimming its
advance since last year’s low on Oct. 3 to 16 percent. That
compares with a 14 percent drop in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) 
since its 2012 peak, a retreat that cut the advance since its
low of 214.89 in September to 9.4 percent.  “The data is just not supporting the view that the U.S. is
going to be a strong spot in the world,” Paul Zemsky, the New
York-based head of  asset allocation  for ING Investment
Management, said in a June 1 phone interview. His firm oversees
$160 billion and favors larger U.S. companies over emerging
markets and European equities. “It’s hard to see what’s going
to change the tone of this market right now.”  GDP has expanded an average of 2.4 percent a quarter since
the recession ended in June 2009, about half the average rate in
recoveries since World War II, according to data compiled by the
Commerce Department and Bloomberg. The growth rate is the
smallest for any of those periods, the data show.  Sentiment Deteriorates  Trend and sentiment indicators used by analysts who base
investment decisions on price and volume charts are
deteriorating. The S&P 500 slipped below its average price in
the previous 200 days on June 1 for the first time since
December. The proportion of newsletter writers who are bearish
on equities rose to a two-month high of 26.6 percent in May,
according to Investors Intelligence, a  New Rochelle , New York-
based research firm.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility, a gauge
known as the VIX that measures the amount investors are paying
for protection from S&P 500 losses, ended last week at a six-
month high of 26.66.  Investors have pulled money from U.S. equity funds every
month since April 2011, the longest streak of outflows since
Washington-based trade group  Investment Company Institute  began
tracking the data in 1984. They took out $7.2 billion during the
five days ended May 23 after $178 billion of withdrawals in the
previous 12 months, ICI data show.  Returns Worsen  Withdrawals came as the S&P 500 has declined 16 percent in
the 12 years since the Internet bubble of the 1990s peaked on
March 24, 2000. Including dividends, the index has returned 0.4
percent a year since then, compared with 19.1 percent annually
in the previous decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  An average of  6.82 billion shares  have traded daily in the
U.S. this year, compared with 7.8 billion in 2011 and 8.52
billion in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg on
exchange-listed securities. The decline shows that profit growth
and shrinking price-earnings ratios are unlikely to rescue
equities, according to  Jon Fisher , a  fund manager  at Fifth Third
Asset Management in  Minneapolis , which oversees about $16
billion.  “I don’t think valuation is support or catalyst for the
market,” Fisher said in a June 1 telephone interview. “We’ve
been on a trend for a number of years for multiple contractions.
There is apathy toward stocks. There is a lack of trust.”  Tractor Supply  Fifth Third recently purchased shares of  Tractor Supply
Co. (TSCO) , the Brentwood, Tennessee-based owner of farm-equipment
stores, and Northfield, Illinois-based Kraft Foods Inc., the
foodmaker splitting in two this year.  Buying shares the day after the weakest payroll reports in
each of the last three years has been a profitable strategy. The
S&P 500 is up 51 percent since 818,000 jobs were cut in January
2009 and 24 percent since 167,000 were eliminated in June 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The index gained 8.1
percent between June 2, 2011, and its peak 10 months later,
though the selloff has left it down 2.7 percent, the data show.  Central bankers in the U.S. and  Europe  took steps in the
past three years to boost economic growth when conditions
deteriorated. The Fed carried out two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing since Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
collapsed in 2008, buying $2.3 trillion in bonds to spur
inflation. Minutes from the Fed’s April meeting showed that
several members believe more stimulus could be necessary “if
the economic recovery lost momentum.”  Fed Stimulus  Policy makers will consider joining Boston Fed President
 Eric Rosengren ’s call for renewed stimulus when they meet June
19 and 20. Rosengren said June 1 that the Fed should further its
full-employment mandate and extend beyond June a program known
as Operation Twist, which lengthens the average duration of
bonds on its balance sheet.  Last year’s selloff in U.S. equity markets coincided with a
decline in forecasts for 2012 GDP growth from 3.15 percent at
the start of the year to 2 percent in October, according to
surveys of economists by Bloomberg. The world’s largest economy
will grow 2.3 percent this year, according to the median
estimate of 74 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “That’s good,” Jeffrey Coons, president of Manning &
Napier Advisors Inc. in Fairport,  New York , said in an interview
at Bloomberg LP’s New York office on June 1. His firm manages
$44 billion. “It means we don’t have to worry about that
ratcheting down of growth expectations. That should help to keep
a floor on stock prices.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
