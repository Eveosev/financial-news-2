Outfielder Magglio Ordonez made his
retirement official before the  Detroit  Tigers’ 5-1 home defeat
to the  New York Yankees .  The 38-year-old Ordonez, a six-time All-Star who won the
American League batting title in 2007, didn’t play this year
after being hampered by ankle injuries the past two seasons.  Ordonez spent 15 Major League Baseball seasons with the
Tigers and Chicago White Sox, hitting .309 with 294 home runs,
2,156 hits and 1,236 runs batted in. Ordonez drove in three runs
on two hits in his final game, a 9-6 win against the Cleveland
Indians on Sept. 27 of last season.  Ordonez’s three-run homer gave the Tigers a sweep over the
Oakland Athletics in the American League Championship Series in
2006, sending them to the  World Series  for the first time since
1984, where they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals. The Tigers
paid tribute to Ordonez before today’s game.  “I don’t look to my personal numbers,” Ordonez said. “I
enjoyed it the most when we won.”  In today’s game at Comerica Park in Detroit,  Derek Jeter 
hit a home run off Justin Verlander’s first pitch. Verlander
then walked Curtis Granderson and Alex Rodriguez before
Granderson scored on Mark Teixeira’s sacrifice fly to put New
York ahead 2-0 in the first inning.  Rodriguez homered in the third before Prince Fielder got
Detroit’s lone run with a home run in the fourth.  Granderson scored on triple in the fifth by Robinson Cano,
who then came home on a throwing error by Tigers second baseman
Danny Worth.  Verlander dropped to 5-4 after giving up five runs in 6 1/3
innings.  Phil Hughes  pitched a complete game for  New York 
(29-24) to improve to 5-5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
