A majority of U.K. voters say that
Prime Minister  David Cameron  has lost control of the coalition
government, a YouGov poll for the Sunday Times showed.  Fifty-nine percent said they didn’t think the Conservative
leader has a grip on government, more than two-thirds believe
him to be out of touch and more people see him as weak than
strong, the  Sunday Times  said, citing the poll.  Cameron’s  Conservative Party  trails the main  Labour Party 
by 10 percentage points, with 32 percent support to 42 percent
for Labour. Cameron’s Liberal Democrat coalition partner had 8
percent backing, according to the poll.  YouGov questioned 1,546 adults online between May 31 and
June 1, the Sunday Times said. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
