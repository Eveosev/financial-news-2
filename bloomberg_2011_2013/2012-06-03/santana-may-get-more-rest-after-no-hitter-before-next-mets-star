Johan Santana  may get an extra day or
two of rest before his next start after throwing the first no-
hitter in  New York  Mets history.  Santana, 33, told reporters yesterday that he felt fine a
day after throwing the third no-hitter of the Major League
Baseball season. He threw a career-high 134 pitches in the win.  Santana is in his first season back from shoulder surgery,
which forced him to miss all of 2011. When he started on opening
day this season, it was his first major league appearance since
Sept. 2, 2010.  “Definitely, the next couple days are going to be
important to see how I recover,” Santana said. “To see when
I’m going to throw my bullpen, and if we have to take an extra
day, there’s nothing wrong with that.”  Santana struck out eight and walked five in his 8-0 victory
against the  St. Louis Cardinals  for the first no-hitter in the
Mets’ 51-season history. The Mets and the  San Diego Padres  had
been the only MLB franchises without a no-hitter.  Santana (3-2) has thrown consecutive shutouts, including a
9-0 victory on May 26 against the Padres. His next start,
scheduled for June 6 at Washington, may be put back until June 7
against the Nationals or June 8 at the  New York Yankees .  Mets manager Terry Collins told reporters that he had
planned to limit Santana to 115 pitches. Santana said he never
thought about asking Collins to take him out.  “It might be once in a lifetime,” Santana told reporters.
“You may spend your entire career and never have a chance to do
it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
