The European Central Bank and the
European Union are drawing up a “master plan” for the euro
area aimed at strengthening the single currency, the German
newspaper  Welt-am-Sonntag  reported, citing unidentified EU and
ECB officials.  The plan includes proposals to integrate euro members’
budget policy, create a “banking union,” a “political union”
and to undertake common structural reforms, the newspaper said.  Euro-area leaders commissioned ECB President  Mario Draghi 
and three other EU leaders at a May 23 meeting to produce the
blueprint by the end of this month, the newspaper said. The
group also includes EU Council President  Herman Van Rompuy , EU
Commission President  Jose Barroso  and Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who heads the group of euro-area finance ministers, the
newspaper said.  A report on the so-called master plan will be included in
the resolutions of the EU summit at the end of June, the
newspaper said. The group of four will also be commissioned to
create a “roadmap” for implementing proposals by the end of
the year, it reported. Berlin warned against inflated
expectations of the outcome, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
