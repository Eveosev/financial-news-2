Ireland will join Spain and  France  at
a European leaders’ summit this month to press for the European
Stability Mechanism to take on the role of recapitalizing euro-
area banks, the  Sunday Times  reported, citing ministers it
didn’t name.  Brian Hayes , a junior minister in the finance and public
expenditure ministries, said such a move would be a “game
changer” for Ireland, according to the newspaper’s Irish
edition. Ireland may seek to shift 43 billion euros ($53.5
billion) of its 62 billion-euro bank bailout costs onto the ESM
if the fund was available for banks, the report said.  “The government supports proposals to allow European funds
to directly capitalize banks and will ensure any proposals at EU
level will be in the best interest of the Irish taxpayer,” the
Finance Ministry said in a statement, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
