Stadtwerke Dusseldorf, a unit of the
third-largest Germany utility, will pay 500 million euros ($630
million) for the world’s “most efficient” gas power station.  The 595-megawatt Dusseldorf plant, to be built by Siemens
AG, will begin commercial operation early 2016, Udo Brockmeier,
management board chairman of EnBW AG’s subsidiary, said today.  “Conventional power plants will be indispensable in the
long term,” EnBW Chief Executive Officer Hans-Peter Villis
said. He expects the power station to run 5,000 hours a year.  The plant will be “the world’s most efficient natural gas
power station,” according to the 54.95 percent-held subsidiary.
Efficiency will be more than 61 percent for power generation and
about 85 percent for power-heat co-generation, Brockmeier said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
