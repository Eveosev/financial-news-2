An absence of rain in  Brazil ’s
producing regions will benefit the harvest of coffee and
sugarcane in Brazil this week, said Somar Meteorologia.  Rain forecast for July 6 and the weekend should delay
harvesting of coffee and sugarcane, which will probably resume
by July 10, said Somar in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
