Easing the conditions for the euro
area’s rescue fund to buy Italian sovereign bonds risks swamping
the financial backstop, Oxford University economist Clemens Fuest wrote in a commentary in Handelsblatt.  Using the planned European Stability Mechanism in an
attempt to lower the borrowing costs of highly indebted
countries might lead bondholders to sell massively to the ESM,
exhausting its finances and forcing governments to commit more
resources, Fuest, a member of the German Finance Ministry’s
group of academic advisers, said in the op-ed article published
in the Dusseldorf, Germany-based newspaper today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
