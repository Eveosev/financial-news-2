U.S. Gulf Coast crude premiums
strengthened as the discount for West Texas Intermediate oil
versus Brent crude widened.  WTI’s discount to Brent grew 75 cents to $13.59, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. When Brent gains versus WTI, it
typically strengthens the value of U.S. grades that compete with
foreign oils priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 25 cents to
$12.25 a barrel at 4:25 p.m.  New York  time.  Mars Blend gained 10 cents a barrel to a premium of $8.75.
Poseidon’s premium widened 35 cents to $7.75 a barrel. Southern
Green’s gap grew 5 cents to $7.25 a barrel more than WTI.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil’s premium weakened $1 a barrel to
$13.10, and  Thunder Horse  fell 20 cents to a premium of $10.80 a
barrel versus WTI.  The discount of Bakken oil to WTI narrowed $4 a barrel to
$10. West Canada Select remained unchanged at a discount of $27
a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
