Hog prices rose to the highest in
almost a year on signs that hot weather in the U.S. will curb
livestock weights and deter producers from slaughtering animals,
reducing pork supplies. Cattle fell.  Temperatures will be at least 5 degrees above normal from
 Colorado  to  Massachusetts  for the rest of the week and possibly
higher in the Midwest, Commodity Weather Group LLC said in a
report. On June 28, the average hog  carcass  weighed 204.03
pounds (92.5 kilograms), down 2.1 pounds from a week earlier,
government data show. Livestock use more energy to stay cool
during hot weather, reducing weight.  “The really big thing is this heat coming down the week,”
Lou Arens, a broker at PCI Advisory Services, said in a
telephone interview from Waucoma,  Iowa .  Hog futures for August settlement climbed 0.6 percent to
95.35 cents a pound at 10:45 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price reached 96.325 cents, the highest
for the most-active contract since July 7, 2011.  Last week, some producers were “backing off” the number
of pigs they were sending to packing plants because of the heat,
Arens said.  Cattle futures for August delivery dropped 0.4 percent to
$1.19925 a pound. Through June 29, the price declined 0.8
percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement declined 1.2
percent to $1.496 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
