South Korea’s Olympic figure skating
champion Kim Yuna said she’ll compete in the 2014 Winter  Olympic
Games  in Sochi, Russia.  “I felt I’d regret it if I quit because of rising
pressure,” Kim, 21, said today at a televised media conference
at a training center at Tae-reung, north east of Seoul. “I will
retire at the Sochi Olympic Games.”  Kim, who won the gold medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics in
 Vancouver , hasn’t competed internationally since placing second
at last year’s World Championships behind Japan’s Miki Ando.  She said she wants to become a member of the  International
Olympic Committee  after her skating career is over. Kim will
return to competitions this year, Yonhap News reported.  Kim, who helped South Korea’s Pyeongchang win the right to
host the 2018 Winter Olympics, has focused on ice shows and
university studies in  South Korea  amid rising speculation she
may retire.  She made her senior international debut in 2006 and set a
world record for the ladies long program at the 2007 Cup of
Russia, and also at the 2010 Winter Olympics, according to a
biography on Kim’s official website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
