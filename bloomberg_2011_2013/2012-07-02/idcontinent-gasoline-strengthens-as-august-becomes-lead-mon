Gasoline strengthened in the
Midcontinent to trade at a premium to futures for the first time
in five days.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the Midcontinent region
strengthened to a 1.13-cent premium to August futures on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:33 p.m., after trading at a 13.75-
cent discount to July futures on June 29, the day that contract
expired. July futures were trading at a 9.54-cent premium to
August futures that day, making today’s spread a 5.34-cent
improvement.  Last week,  Phillips 66 (PSX)  “placed quite a few barrels in the
Midcontinent and took it down to that level,” said Steve Mosby,
vice president at ADO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in  Kansas
City , Kansas. “They were just long a lot of gasoline. Today
could be a function of getting that value back.”  Conventional gasoline in Chicago weakened 1 cent to a
discount of 5.5 cents a gallon versus futures. Gulf Coast
gasoline strengthened 0.87 cent to a discount of 10.88 cents a
gallon against  New York  futures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
