Linde AG (LIN) , the world’s second-biggest
maker of industrial gases, said it plans to fund the acquisition
of  Lincare Holdings Inc. (LNCR)  with a $4.5 billion acquisition loan
and existing cash.  The acquisition loan will be refinanced with a share sale
of as much as 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) and by other
debt, the Munich, Germany-based company said in the statement.
It will seek to maintain its current credit ratings of A by
Standard & Poor’s and A3 by Moody’s Investors Service.  Linde said today it agreed to buy Lincare in Clearwater,
 Florida  for about $4.6 billion including assumed debt. Lincare
provides oxygen and respiratory therapy services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
