OpenTable Inc. (OPEN) , the largest U.S.
online restaurant-reservation service, fell the most in two
months after Barclays Plc issued a report that said the company
may post its first-ever sequential decline in revenue.  OpenTable dropped $4.20, or 9.3 percent, at the close in
 New York . The shares have decreased 51 percent in the past year
through today.  Second-quarter revenue may fall to $38.5 million from $39.4
million in the previous three months, Mark May, an analyst at
Barclays, said today in a note. May also lowered his estimate
for reservations made through the service in the period to 29.5
million from 31.4 million. OpenTable is paid for each table its
seats at a restaurant, which means reservation revenue will fall
in tandem, he said.  “We’re stepping to the sidelines as our quarterly checks
suggest OpenTable continued to see soft seated diner growth,”
said May, who downgraded the company from “overweight” to
“equalweight” today. “We now believe the company’s 2Q12
results could come in below consensus forecasts and could result
in OpenTable posting its first sequential revenue decline on
record.”  OpenTable’s revenue may slow after traffic to casual-dining
restaurants fell 3.9 percent in May and has been declining since
March, May said. The average analyst estimate for sales in the
current quarter is $39.5 million, according to a Bloomberg
survey.  OpenTable, based in  San Francisco , dominates the market for
reservations in the U.S., with more than 17,700 restaurant
subscribers, and may reach 19,500 in 2012,  James Dobson , an
analyst at Benchmark Co., said in an e-mail. Eateries pay the
service about $1 for each seated diner whose reservation was
made through OpenTable.com and its partners, such as  Yelp Inc. (YELP) ,
and 25 cents for each table booked through a restaurant’s own
website, Dobson said.  Restaurants also can pay for OpenTable’s computer system,
which lets them manage table inventory and maintain a profile of
customers who have dined there, on top of other fees.  Francesca Touma, a spokeswoman for OpenTable, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
