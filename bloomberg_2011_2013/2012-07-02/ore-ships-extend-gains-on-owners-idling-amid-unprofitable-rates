The largest ore carriers gained for a
10th day as unprofitable rates are leading owners to market
fewer of their vessels, according to Commodore Research.  Daily earnings for Capesizes, the largest commodity
carriers, rose 4.5 percent today to $4,166, according to the
 Baltic Exchange , the London-based publisher of freight rates.
The increase helped the Baltic Dry Index, a broader gauge of
raw-materials shipping costs, add 0.9 percent to 1,013 points.  Ship owners are idling vessels or choosing not to list them
as available as rates remain below operating costs, said  Jeffrey Landsberg , president of New York-based consultant Commodore.
 Daily income  averaged $3,884 a day last month, the lowest since
at least 1999, exchange data show. Capesizes cost $7,437 to
operate, including crew, insurance and repairs but not fuel,
according to figures from accounting firm Moore Stephens.  “The increase in the last few days is not because of
increased demand as much as owners taking vessels out of the
market,” Landsberg said by phone today, adding that rates for
the vessels will fluctuate between $4,000 and $7,000 a day “for
the foreseeable future.”  The smaller vessel types tracked by the bourse were little
changed. Panamaxes, which are about half as large, rose 1
percent to $7,910, according to the exchange. Supramax earnings
rose 0.6 percent to $13,218 a day while Handysizes, the smallest
ships in the index, slid 0.1 percent to $10,405.  To contact the reporter on this story:
