Saudi Arabia , which is spending about
$500 billion to build infrastructure and industry, said its
cabinet approved the kingdom’s first mortgage law, more than a
decade after it was first proposed.  The law stipulates the regulations to establish mortgage
companies and their activities, state-run Saudi Press Agency
 reported today , citing Minister of Culture and Information
Abdulaziz Khoja after a cabinet meeting.  The mortgage market in Saudi Arabia, the biggest Arab
economy, is the least developed among the six Gulf Cooperation
Council states, CBRE Group Inc. said in March. Only 2 percent of
home purchases in the kingdom have been financed through
mortgages, compared with 17 percent in the  United Arab Emirates 
and 70 percent in the U.K., according to CBRE.  The law is part of an overhaul of the kingdom’s home
finance market, regulating all parts of the industry: from
registering mortgages to allowing judges to prosecute police
officers who fail to carry out eviction orders. It’s expected to
encourage banks to lend as it would ease the concerns of lenders
discouraged by previously unclear regulation that could lead to
lengthy court disputes in cases of default.  The Tadawul Real Estate Development Industries Index
rallied 5.5 percent ahead of the announcement.  Dar Al Arkan Real
Estate Development Co. (ALARKAN) , the kingdom’s largest publicly traded
developer, surged 9.6 percent, while  Saudi Real Estate Co. (SRECO) 
increased 7.2 percent and  Emaar Economic City (EMAAR)  gained 7.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
