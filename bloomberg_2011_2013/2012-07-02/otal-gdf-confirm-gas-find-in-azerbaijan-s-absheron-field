Total SA (FP) , Europe’s third-biggest
energy company, and  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA said results from the Absheron
discovery in the Azerbaijan sector of the  Caspian Sea  indicated
gas resources of as much as 300 billion cubic meters.  “This declaration of commerciality is the result of the
success of our more aggressive exploration program and our
desire to bring discovered hydrocarbons rapidly into
production,” Yves-Louis Darricarrere, Total’s president of
exploration and production, said today in a statement.  Total is the operator of the Absheron project with a 40
percent stake. Its partners are  State Oil Co. (ATPG)  of Azerbaijan,
which also has 40 percent, and GDF Suez with 20 percent.  The field is located 100 kilometers south-east of the Azeri
capital of Baku.  Total is also a partner in the BP Plc-led Shah Deniz
deposit, which is estimated to contain 1.2 trillion cubic meters
of gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
