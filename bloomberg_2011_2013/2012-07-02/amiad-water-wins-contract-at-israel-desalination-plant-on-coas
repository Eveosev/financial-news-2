Amiad Water Systems Ltd. (AFS) , an Israeli
water treatment and filtration system producer, said today that
it won a contract at Mekorot Water Co.’s Ashdod desalination
plant, one of Israel’s largest facilities.  Amiad rose as much as 3.5 percent today in London trading
after announcing the $1.67 million contract, the most in more
than two months, increasing share gains this year to 44 percent.  A unit of Mekorot, Israel’s national water company, will
operate the desalination plant, which is due to begin operating
early next year. When done, the Ashdod plant will supply about
15 percent of Israel’s domestic water consumption. It will be
the fourth reverse osmosis desalination plant to be built along
 Israel ’s Mediterranean coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
