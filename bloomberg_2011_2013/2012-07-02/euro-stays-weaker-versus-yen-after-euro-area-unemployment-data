The euro stayed weaker against the
yen and the dollar after a report showed euro-area unemployment
reached the highest on record in May.  The 17-nation shared currency was 0.3 percent weaker at
100.77 yen as of 10:06 a.m. London time, and traded 0.2 percent
lower at $1.2648.  The jobless rate in the 17-nation euro area rose to 11.1
percent in May from 11 percent in April, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. That’s the highest
since the data series started in 1995.  To contact the reporter on this story:
