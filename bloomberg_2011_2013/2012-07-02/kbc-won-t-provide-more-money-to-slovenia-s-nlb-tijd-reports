KBC Groep NV (KBC)  won’t provide additional
capital to Slovenian lender Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.,  De Tijd 
reported today, without saying where it got the information.  KBC, which owns 25 percent of NLB, pulled out of a plan to
inject 61 million euros ($77 million) and raise its stake in
Slovenia’s largest lender to about 34 percent, the newspaper
said, adding that the move may be due to the Belgian bank not
receiving the European Commission’s approval. NLB reported a
loss in 2011 for a third consecutive year on surging bad loans
and needs cash to meet the European Banking Authority’s
requirements, De Tijd said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
