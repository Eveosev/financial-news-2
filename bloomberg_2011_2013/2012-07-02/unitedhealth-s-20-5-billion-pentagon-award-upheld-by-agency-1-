A U.S. government agency upheld the
Pentagon’s $20.5 billion contract award to  UnitedHealth Group
Inc. (UNH) , dashing incumbent TriWest Healthcare Alliance Corp.’s
hopes of persuading the Defense Department to reconsider.  TriWest executives had protested the Pentagon’s March
decision with the Government Accountability Office, which
arbitrates contract disputes, saying Defense department
officials told them during a post-award briefing that their
company had made a lower bid for the work. The GAO ruled in
UnitedHealth’s favor today.  The GAO found that the Defense Department’s “evaluation
was reasonable, and denied TriWest’s protest on all counts,”
Ralph O. White, the GAO’s managing associate general counsel for
procurement law, said in an e-mailed statement.  UnitedHealth shares fell 3.8 percent to $56.26 in  New York 
Stock Exchange Composite trading, the biggest decline since
October. The shares were down 4 percent before the GAO
announcement.  The stock is down because of last week’s  Supreme Court 
decision that found U.S. health-care reform legislation is
constitutional, and “may rebound a bit,”  Ana Gupte , an analyst
with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York, said in a phone
interview.  “This is very good for UnitedHealth,” she said. “It now
places them firmly in every government program.”  Considering Options  UnitedHealth looks forward to working with the Pentagon and
TriWest “to ensure a smooth transition for service members,
retirees and their families,” said Lori C. McDougal, chief
executive officer of the unit of the company that will handle
the contract.  “We are committed to working with the  Department of
Defense  to ensure beneficiaries have access to cost-effective,
quality and innovative care,” she said in an e-mailed
statement.  Closely held TriWest has helped manage the military’s
health services for the past 16 years. The work has generated
more than $20 billion in contracts for the Phoenix-based company
since fiscal 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There are options that remain,” Scott Celley, a TriWest
spokesman, said in a phone interview. He declined to comment on
the company’s next moves, saying TriWest officials have yet to
see the details of the decision. Companies may file suit in the
U.S. Court of Federal Claims over contract disputes.  Shutdown ‘Likely’  “We will be discussing this decision with our company’s
owners and the counsel who represent us, and will, in turn, be
making a decision on what, if any, action we will take,” David McIntyre Jr., TriWest’s chief executive officer, said in an e-
mailed statement.  Without the contract, “it is likely” the company would
shut down, McIntyre previously said. TriWest in recent weeks
blanketed the Washington area with ads attacking UnitedHealth
and saying that “Military families deserve better.”  TriWest was ranked No. 21 on the Bloomberg Government top
200 federal contractor list released last month. It received
$3.1 billion in awards during the fiscal year that ended Sept.
30.  The military’s health program, called Tricare, on March 16
gave UnitedHealth the contract after initially choosing TriWest
in 2009. Minnetonka, Minnesota-based UnitedHealth had persuaded
the Pentagon to reconsider last year.  Lead Contractor  UnitedHealth is scheduled to take over the contract in
April 1, 2013, managing care for active-duty military, retirees
and their families in 21 states, mostly in the West. It would
become one of Tricare’s lead contractors for the first time.  The GAO, Congress’s investigative arm, issues decisions
that provide guidance to government agencies during contract
disputes. It can’t compel agencies to follow its
recommendations, though its guidance is rarely ignored.  “There’s an awful lot at stake for TriWest, so they may
want to go down fighting and they may win,” said  Sheryl Skolnick , an analyst with CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “Until the last possible avenue of protest is
exhausted, I have a feeling this contract won’t be finally
awarded.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
