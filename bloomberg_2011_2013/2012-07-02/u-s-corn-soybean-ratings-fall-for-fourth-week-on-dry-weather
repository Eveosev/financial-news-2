U.S. corn- and soybean-crop
conditions declined for a fourth straight week as hot, dry
weather curbs yield prospects.  About 48 percent of the corn was rated good or excellent
as of yesterday, down from 56 percent a week earlier and 69
percent a year earlier, the Department of Agriculture said
today in a  report . Approximately 45 percent of soybeans earned
the top ratings, down from 53 percent last week and 66 percent
a year earlier, the department said. Little or no rain has
fallen in most of the Great Plains and Midwest in the past
week, National Weather Service data show.  “The weather hasn’t changed,”  Larry Glenn , an analyst at
Frontier Ag in Quinter,  Kansas , said before the report. Crop
prices will keep rising and conditions will fall further
“until the weather gets a hint of moisture,” he said.  The spring-wheat crop was rated 71 percent good or
excellent, compared with 77 percent a week earlier, USDA data
show. The winter-wheat crop was 69 percent harvested, up from
59 percent a week earlier, the department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
