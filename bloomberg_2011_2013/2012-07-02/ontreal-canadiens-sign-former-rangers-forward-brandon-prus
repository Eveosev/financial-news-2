The  Montreal Canadiens  signed free
agent left wing Brandon Prust, who had a team-leading 156
penalty minutes in helping the  New York Rangers  reach the
National Hockey League’s Eastern Conference finals last season.  Prust, 28, tied for the league-lead in major penalties last
season and said he’ll bring a physical toughness to the
Canadiens, who finished in last place in the East during the
2011-12 season with a 31-35-16 record.  “It’s good for the identity of the group to have more team
toughness,” Prust, whose girlfriend lives and works in
Montreal, told NHL.com. “When a team walks into our arena they
should know they’ve got a long night ahead of them.”  Prust had five goals and 12 assists for  New York  last
season after recording a career-high 13 goals and 29 points for
the Giants in 2010-11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
