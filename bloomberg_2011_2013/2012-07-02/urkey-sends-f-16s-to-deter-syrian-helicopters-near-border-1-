Turkey  dispatched F-16 jets to warn
off Syrian military helicopters approaching its border on three
occasions yesterday, the military said.  Two of the incidents involved a Syrian helicopter coming as
close as 2.5 miles to the Turkish border and in another incident
as near as 2 miles, the military said in a statement on its
website today. The Turkish jets were scrambled to Adana, Hatay
and Kilis provinces in response to Syrian air movements, the
military said.  New rules of engagement were introduced for the Turkish
armed forces following the shooting down of an F-4 Phantom jet
by Syrian air defenses on June 22. The rules mean that any
Syrian forces approaching the border in what’s deemed a
threatening manner can be attacked, Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said last week.  While Turkey accepts the jet strayed into  Syria , it says it
was shot down while over international airspace. Syria says the
Turkish jet violated its territory, though it termed the plane’s
destruction an “accident.” The two-man crew is still missing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
