Australia’s dollar traded 0.4 percent
from an almost two-month high on bets the nation’s central bank
will leave  interest rates  on hold tomorrow, preserving the yield
advantage of the nation’s assets.  The  New Zealand dollar  maintained its biggest gain in three
weeks versus the greenback as Asian stocks extended a global
rally. Demand for the Australian currency was limited after a
private report showed the nation’s  manufacturing  contracted in
June for a fourth consecutive month. Data today will probably
show manufacturing growth in the U.S. slowed.  “It looks like most economists are expecting no cut, and
the market is expecting a very small chance of a cut,” said
 Andrew Salter , a strategist at  Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in Sydney. “The Aussie is probably going to be well
supported around these levels given that outlook.”  Australia’s dollar traded at $1.0227 at 4:08 p.m. in Sydney
from $1.0238 last week in  New York , after touching $1.0270, the
strongest since May 4. The so-called Aussie weakened 0.4 percent
to 81.36 yen.  New Zealand ’s currency traded at 80.11 U.S. cents,
after gaining 1.7 percent to 80.13 cents on June 29, the
sharpest advance since June 6. The kiwi slid 0.3 percent to
63.73 yen.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares added 0.3 percent
today. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 2.5 percent on June
29, after Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 2.7 percent following
the decision by European leaders to ease terms on loans to
Spanish banks during a two-day summit last week.  RBA Decision  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia will keep the overnight cash-
rate target at 3.5 percent at tomorrow’s policy meeting,
according to  all 28 economists  in a Bloomberg News survey. Swaps
data compiled by Bloomberg show traders see a better than 70
percent chance rates will be unchanged. That’s up from a
probability of about 40 percent a week ago.  Australia’s 10-year government bond yield surged 15 basis
points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 3.19 percent. The rate
earlier touched 3.25 percent, the most since May 17. New
Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to receive
floating rates, added six basis points to 2.8 percent.  China ’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index fell to 50.2 in June
from 50.4 in May, the Beijing-based National Bureau of
Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
yesterday. The HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics reported a
June final reading of 48.2 for their  purchasing managers’ index 
today, compared with 48.4 in May.  Australia ’s manufacturing contracted last month as concern
about the currency’s strength and a new pollution tax
overshadowed new orders, according to a survey by the Australian
Industry Group and PricewaterhouseCoopers released today.  U.S. Manufacturing  In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management Inc. will
probably report that its factory index fell to 52 in June, from
53.5 the prior month, a Bloomberg poll showed before the data
are released today. A reading greater than 50 signals expansion.  “The positive surprise of a European Summit actually
deciding anything, let alone something that counts, was
reflected in the surge in risk appetite and concomitant market
reaction,” strategists at  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  wrote in
a note to clients today. “This has settled and may hold today,
as markets absorb the details and turn to the global economic
realities.”  New Zealand’s dollar may rise to the highest in more than
two months as its short-term momentum has a “bullish” bias,
 Niall O’Connor , a New York-based technical analyst at JPMorgan
Chase & Co., wrote in a research note yesterday.  The so-called kiwi is facing an ‘important’’ test at the
level of 80.60 U.S. cents to 80.90, which sits on a downtrend
line from the Feb. 29 high, the analyst wrote. Rising above that
may take the currency toward April highs, O’Connor wrote.  The South Pacific nation’s currency reached 83.20 on April
13, the highest since March 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
