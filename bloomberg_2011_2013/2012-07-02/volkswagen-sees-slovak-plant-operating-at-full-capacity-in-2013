Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s assembly factory in
Slovakia will continue operating at full capacity throughout
next year as demand for new models produced in the country
outweighs the euro-area slowdown, a company official said.  The factory will keep the target of assembling more than
400,000 vehicles in 2012 and the outlook for the next year is at
a “very similar” level, the unit’s Chief Executive Officer
Albrecht Reimold told reporters in Bratislava, the Slovak
capital, today.  Europe ’s largest carmaker is boosting output in Slovakia,
seeking to benefit from the country’s euro adoption combined
with lower labor costs than in western Europe. The company plans
to invest 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in expansion of the
Slovak facilities in the coming five years, including a 600
million-euro body shop whose construction has already begun.  European car sales dropped an annual 8.4 percent in May,
the eighth consecutive decline, led by  France ’s PSA Peugeot
Citroen and  Renault SA (RNO) , as consumers held off purchases on
concern over the slowing economy, according to the European
Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Volkswagen’s European
sales declined 5.5 percent.  Volkswagen in Slovakia makes Touareg and Audi-brand Q7
SUVs, as well as bodies for Porsche Cayenne. Last year it
started to produce exclusively in Bratislava the so-called New
Small Family line of cars, made for Volkswagen, Seat and Skoda
brands. The planned increase in volume from about 210,000 cars
made in 2011 is due mainly to new sub-compact models.  To contact the reporter on this story:
