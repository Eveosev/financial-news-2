Volatility in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index is returning to levels that drove  valuations  and stock
volume down to rates not seen since at least 2003.  Average daily price changes  in the benchmark gauge for
American equities doubled to 1 percent in June, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time, U.S. trading has
plunged to 6.8 billion shares a day and valuations are 16
percent below the five-decade mean. Reaching those levels in
tandem is unprecedented in at least nine years, the data show.  Investors whipsawed by volatility that reached twice the
50-year average in 2011 have pulled about $300 billion from
mutual funds since the  bull market  began three years ago. With
the third quarter marking the worst S&P 500 returns in election
years since World War II, bears say widening price swings will
keep individuals from returning to the market. Bulls say their
exodus helped pull stocks lower just before growth in earnings
and the economy helped spur the biggest June rally since 1999.  “We still believe in the bull market,”  Laszlo Birinyi ,
president of Birinyi Associates Inc., said in a June 29 phone
interview from Westport,  Connecticut . “I’m just telling people
to turn the page to the investments, the things that you can
really quantify and put your fingers on. Stick to what truly
matters: the company fundamentals.”  European Deal  The S&P 500  rallied  2 percent to 1,362.16 last week,
bringing the monthly return to 4 percent, the most for June
since the gauge added 5.4 percent in 1999. European leaders
agreed to relax conditions on emergency loans for Spanish banks
and possible help for  Italy , boosting stocks globally even as
first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits were higher
than economists forecast.  The gauge declined  9.9 percent  from its high on April 2
through June 1 after climbing 12 percent in the first three
months, the best start to a year since 1998. Shares in the  S&P
500  are up 101 percent since March 2009, and remain 13 percent
below the all-time high of 1,565.15 in October 2007. The index
rose 0.3 percent to 1,365.51 today.  Mutual funds that invest in U.S. equities saw $1.8 billion
in outflows for the week ending June 20 and $620 million in the
previous period, according to data from the Washington-based
 Investment Company Institute . More than $190 billion has been
taken out of American equity funds in the 13 months through May,
while more than $200 billion has gone into bonds, the data show.  ‘Frozen’ Investors  “A lot of investors are just frozen, unsure what to do, so
they do nothing,” Howard Ward, who helps oversee $35 billion at
Gamco Investors Inc. in Rye,  New York , said June 26. “There are
no raging bulls looking to leverage up on margin and risk their
savings. Everyone is cautious, with some more so than others.”  Withdrawals are coming as swings in stocks from  L-3
Communications Holdings Inc. (LLL)  to Deere & Co. widen. The S&P 500
moved an average 1 percent each day in June, almost doubling
from the previous five months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Volatility is rising toward its level in 2011, when price
changes were 1.3 percent between April and the end of December,
twice the five-decade average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Daily swings reached 4 percent in December 2008, data
using 50-day moving averages compiled by Bloomberg show.  The flight from mutual funds helped lower daily  volume  for
U.S. exchange-listed stocks to 6.8 billion shares in 2012, down
44 percent from its peak in October 2008, according to data
compiled by Barclays Plc and Bloomberg.  Light Volume  Volume hasn’t been this light at the same time that
valuations were below their historic average since at least
2003, when the data began. Of the  500 companies  in the benchmark
U.S. equity index, 262 of them saw June volume that fell from a
year ago, Bloomberg data show.  “Investors are feeling the market as a roller coaster
ride,” Nick Sargen, chief investment officer at Fort Washington
Investment Advisors in Cincinnati, which oversees about $40
billion said June 27. “All those gains that got made in the
first quarter got wiped out in a month’s time. There’s just too
much uncertainty to be making decisions, and there’s the risk
that they’re going to get whipsawed again.”  Widening stock swings are a reversal of the first quarter,
when daily changes narrowed to 0.5 percent, the smallest since
1995, the data show. The decline from the previous year was the
biggest reduction since 1934, according to Bloomberg data.  Equity Funds  Calmer stock markets attracted more money to mutual funds
over the last decade. U.S. funds added $14.5 billion in the
first quarter of 2007, when the average daily swing was 0.5
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg and ICI show.  More than $700 billion has been erased from American equity
values since this year’s S&P 500 high of 1,419.04 on April 2,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The retreat has trimmed
the gauge’s 2012 advance to 8.3 percent from 13 percent.  Equities may be entering the worst period of the year, if
history is any guide. The index has gained an average of 0.1
percent in third quarters before a presidential vote since 1945,
the lowest return of the year, according to S&P. U.S. shares
gained 5.7 percent in election years since World War II, the
second-worst performance during executive branch terms.  “Most of the volatility is a lack of conviction on the
part of the market,”  Peter Sorrentino , a senior  fund manager  at
Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati, which oversees $14.7
billion of assets, said June 28. “It creates this element of
fear because one sector is rocky one day and another sells off
the next day. That dissuades people from committing any money.”  European Shares  European leaders dropped requirements that taxpayers get
preferred creditor status on aid to  Spain ’s banks and opened the
way to recapitalize lenders directly after a two-day summit last
week. Two years of losses have pushed  European stocks  near the
lowest valuations ever, as the Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell to 0.9
times book value, cheaper than any time except the week markets
bottomed in March 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Eric Teal, at First Citizens Bancshares Inc., said the
corporate earnings season will convince investors to come back
to the market. New York-based Alcoa Inc., the country’s largest
aluminum producer, is scheduled to be the first  Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU)  company to report results, on July 9.  “The lower-return environment and less appetite for risk-
taking is having a compounding negative effect on the stock
market,” Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens,
which manages $4.5 billion in Raleigh,  North Carolina , said June
26. “Second-quarter earnings and more policy initiatives in the
coming months will provide relief.”  L-3, Life  L-3 Communications is  down 15 percent  in the past 12 months
even as the company boosted its full-year  profit  forecast in
April. The stock rose or fell 1.3 percent a day in June, up from
0.7 percent in the first five months of the year, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Daily trading in L-3, a maker of military
communications and electronics equipment, fell 30 percent last
month from the average in 2011.  Trading in  Life Technologies Corp. (LIFE) , the provider of gene-
analysis tools based in Carlsbad,  California , was 42 percent
lower last month than a year ago. The stock fell 7.9 percent in
the second quarter even after Life  posted better-than-forecast
earnings . Daily moves rose to 2 percent in June from 1.2 percent
in the previous five months.  Deere Swings  Average swings in  Deere (DE) , the largest maker of agricultural
equipment, surpassed last year’s level to 1.7 percent from 1
percent between January and May, according to Bloomberg data.
Volume in the shares has decreased to 3.6 million shares a day
this month, 24 percent below the 2011 average. The shares are
down 1.9 percent in the past year, even after Moline, Illinois-
based Deere reported  better-than-estimated  earnings for all four
quarters of 2011.  S&P 500  earnings  have exceeded analyst projections for
three years even as the world’s largest economy expands at its
slowest post-recession rate in six decades, Bloomberg data show.
They are forecast to surpass $100 a share for the first time
this year and to rise 13 percent in 2013 while economists say
the U.S. will expand 2.2 percent in 2012 and 2.4 percent next.  Higher profits kept the price-to-earnings ratio at an
average 13.8 in the first six months of 2012, 16 percent less
than the 16.4 mean since 1954.  “That’s one of the favorable things that is going on,
corporate earnings are coming through,”  Byron Wien , vice
chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners LP, said in a June 26
interview with Ken Prewitt and  Tom Keene  in Bloomberg Radio’s
“ Bloomberg Surveillance .” “The market is cheap. The problem
is investors don’t have any confidence in the future because
they are so confused.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
