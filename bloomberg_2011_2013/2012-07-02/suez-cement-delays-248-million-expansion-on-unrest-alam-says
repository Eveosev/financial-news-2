Suez Cement (SUCE) ,  Egypt â€™s biggest publicly
traded producer of the material, delayed a 1.5 billion Egyptian-
pound ($248 million) capacity expansion,  Al Alam Al Youm 
reported, citing Managing Director Bruno Carrea.  The company has postponed additional production lines at
its factory in Ein El Sokhna for a year or two because of
political unrest, the newspaper cited Carrea as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
