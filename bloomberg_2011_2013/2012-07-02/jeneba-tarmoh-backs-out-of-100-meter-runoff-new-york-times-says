Jeneba Tarmoh backed out of tonight’s
100-meter run-off against Allyson Felix for the final spot on
the U.S. Olympic track and field team, the  New York  Times
reported.  The newspaper said the sprinter’s agent, Kimberly Holland,
confirmed the move.  The unprecedented head-to-head race in Eugene,  Oregon , was
scheduled to be held nine days after the training partners tied
for third place in the women’s event at the U.S. Olympic trials.  Jill Geer, a spokeswoman for USA Track and Field, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail or phone call seeking comment.  Felix and Tarmoh each finished the June 23 100-meter final
with a time of 11.068 seconds, initially leaving  USA Track and
Field  without a rule to determine the third Olympic qualifier.
The race was won by Carmelita Jeter in 10.92 seconds, followed
by Tianna Madison in 10.96.  Tarmoh, 22, at first was announced as the third-place
finisher, giving her what she thought was berth in the Olympic
sprint after beating Felix by 0.0001. After officials reviewed
video, they announced the finish as a dead heat.  The following day, procedures were announced that provided
for a run-off or a coin toss if one of the runners didn’t agree
to resign her position.  The decision to conduct a run-off didn’t come until after
both women competed two days ago in the 200 meters, a race won
by Felix in 21.69 seconds to break the 24-year-old meet record
of Florence Griffith-Joyner. Tarmoh was fifth.  Both runners will head to  London  as members of the 400-
meter relay team. They said they never gave serious
consideration to letting the final 100-meter spot be decided on
a coin flip.  Felix, 26, is ranked ninth in the world in the 100, while
Tarmoh is 66th, according to All-Athletics.com.  To contact the reporter on this story:
