Anthony Davis , the top pick in the
National Basketball Association draft, sprained his ankle during
a workout with the New Orleans Hornets, Yahoo Sports reported.  Davis, a finalist for a berth on the U.S. Olympic team,
“almost assuredly” won’t be able to play for the squad heading
to the London Games, the website said, citing people in the
league.  Harold Kaufman, a spokesman for the Hornets, declined
immediate comment in a telephone interview.  The 19-year-old Davis had “an excellent chance” to make
the roster after the U.S. team lost players including NBA All-
Stars  Dwyane Wade , Derrick Rose and Chris Bosh to injuries,
Yahoo said. The former University of Kentucky player was
selected first by the Hornets in the draft after leading the
Wildcats to the national title in his freshman year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
