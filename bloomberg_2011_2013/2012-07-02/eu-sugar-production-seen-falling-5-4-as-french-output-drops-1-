Sugar production in the European
Union will fall by 5.4 percent next season, with output in
 France , the bloc’s biggest grower, sliding 3.2 percent,
according to the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm.  The EU will produce 17.6 million metric tons of sugar in
the 2012-13 season that starts in October, the commission said
in a June 28  report  on its website. That is down from 18.6
million tons in 2011-12, according to the report.  Output in France will fall to 4.62 million tons from 4.78
million tons the previous year, the commission forecast. Yields
in the 27-nation bloc will drop to 11.1 tons a hectare (2.47
acres) from 11.6 tons a hectare in 2011-12, the report showed.
Cane sugar produced in France’s overseas territories is forecast
to slip to 280,000 tons from 417,000 tons a year earlier.  Germany ’s crop, the EU’s second-largest, is forecast to
rise by 1.8 percent to 4.34 million tons from 4.27 million tons
a year earlier, the data showed. Production in third-ranking
 Poland  will be 1.64 million tons in 2012-13 from 1.91 million
tons a year earlier, the commission forecasts.  The European Union white sugar price averaged 716 euros
($902) a ton in April, the highest since at least July 2006, the
commission said in a separate report on its website. White sugar
futures on NYSE Liffe are $615 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
