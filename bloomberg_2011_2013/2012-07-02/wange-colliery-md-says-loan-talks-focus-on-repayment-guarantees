Hwange Colliery Ltd.’s talks with the
 Development Bank  of  South Africa  over a proposed $100 million
loan are focused on how the Zimbabwean mining company will
guarantee repayment, Managing Director Fred Moyo said.  “Our talks are now centered on how to provide DBSA with
the necessary security,” Moyo said today in a phone interview
from western Zimbabwe’s Hwange, the nation’s biggest colliery.  The mine needs at least $200 million to recapitalize the
business, Moyo told the state-run Chronicle newspaper on May 16.  Hwange exports coal to neighboring countries and India, and
provides coal for Zimbabwe Power Corp., a unit of government-
owned electricity utility Zesa Holdings (Pvt) Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
