OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel (MMK)  rose on
speculation the court may strike down the steelmaker’s proposed
takeover of Australia’s  Flinders Mines Ltd. (FMS)   The shares climbed 3.1 percent to 9.533 rubles by 11:53
a.m. in Moscow, the highest intraday price since June 21. They
led gains on the benchmark Micex index, which added 0.6 percent
to 1,395.58.  The Russian steelmaker, known as MMK, saw its A$554 million
($566 million) takeover offer blocked after minority investor
Elena Egorova won a court decision in March preventing the deal,
claiming it discriminated against her interests as a
shareholder. The case will be heard today at the Chelyabinsk
court, which last month dismissed an appeal from MMK to lift the
injunction on the deal.  “The shares are likely rising on the possibility of the
deal’s cancellation,” Oleg Petropavlovskiy, an analyst at
Broker Credit Service in Moscow, said by phone. “This would
mean MMK won’t increase its spending and its credit profile will
look better.”  MMK agreed to acquire the Adelaide-based iron-ore producer
in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
