Hungary’s government bonds yields
rose the most in more than three weeks after the central bank
said it may have to raise  interest rates  to counter the impact
of a planned tax on commercial banks’ deposits.  The slump in the benchmark three-year notes lifted yields
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 7.559 percent by
2:22 p.m. in Budapest, the biggest jump since June 8, after
reaching the lowest ever for that security on June 29. The
forint depreciated 0.1 percent to 286.30 per euro.  The impact of levying the tax on lenders’ deposits at the
central bank would equal a rate cut of 2.5 percentage point,
which the central bank could only counterbalance by increasing
the benchmark rate,  Andras Simor , president of the Magyar
Nemzeti Bank, told reporters today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
