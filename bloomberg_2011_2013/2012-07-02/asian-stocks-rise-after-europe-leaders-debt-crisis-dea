Asian stocks  rose  for a fourth day in
the longest winning streak since March as economic data from
 China  to Japan and steps by European leaders to address the
sovereign-debt crisis eased concern global growth is slowing.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company,
climbed 0.9 percent after a Chinese manufacturing gauge beat
economists’ predictions.  TDK Corp. (6762) , a maker of electronic parts
that gets almost 30 percent of its revenue from China, gained
1.6 percent in  Tokyo .  Aristocrat Leisure Ltd. (ALL) , an Australian
manufacturer of gaming machines, slumped 11 percent after
reporting preliminary earnings for the first half of this year.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 0.4 percent to 117.67
as of 7:14 p.m. in Tokyo. Markets are closed in  Hong Kong  today.
The stock gauge capped last week the biggest weekly gain since
January, jumping 2.7 percent as euro-zone leaders agreed to
relax conditions for recapitalizing lenders.  “The economic momentum in Asia and the U.S. is still
intact as long the European situation doesn’t disturb that
momentum,” said Ng Soo Nam, Singapore-based chief investment
officer at Nikko Asset Management Asia Ltd., which oversees
about $165 billion. “It will take years to fully resolve the
underlying economic issues and repair the fiscal balance sheets
in Europe. If Europe can just stabilize the financial markets
and work things through, they stand a good chance of fixing the
problems.”  Tankan Survey  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell less than 0.1 percent
even after the quarterly Tankan index on sentiment among the
nation’s manufacturers beat estimates. South Korea’s Kospi Index
lost 0.1 percent, China’s Shanghai Composite Index was little
changed and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.9 percent.
Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.1 percent.  The MSCI All-Country World Index of shares in 45 nations
climbed 6 percent over the first six months of 2012, led by the
U.S., where $1.1 trillion was added to share values. The  MSCI
Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  climbed 3 percent through the end of June,
compared with an 8.3 percent advance by the  S&P 500  and a 2.7
percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are  valued  at 12 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.1 times for the S&P 500 and 10.6 times
for the Stoxx 600.  In China, the government’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index, a
measure of manufacturing, was 50.2 in June, little changed from
50.4 in May, the Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics and
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said at the
weekend. That beat the 49.9 median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 24 economists. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.
A separate PMI, compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc and Market
Economics, posted a final reading of 48.2 in June compared with
48.4 in May, according to figures released today.  China Home Prices  “The Chinese PMI isn’t as bad as expected,” said  Hideyuki Ishiguro , assistant manager of investment strategy at Okasan
Securities Co. in Tokyo. “The decline may help expectations for
easing monetary policies to be continued.”  China’s new home prices rose in May for the first time in
10 months as the government eased monetary policies to bolster
the economy, according to a survey released today by SouFun
Holdings Ltd., the nation’s biggest real-estate website owner.  Companies that do business in China advanced.  BHP Billiton 
rose 0.9 percent to A$31.72. TDK climbed 1.6 percent to 3,250
yen. Murata Manufacturing Co., an electronic-parts maker that
gets the highest proportion of sales in China among Topix Index
companies, rose 0.5 percent to 4,175 yen in Osaka.  Rate Cut  Bets on global central bank action to spur economic growth
helped boost stocks in the first half of 2012. Economists expect
this to continue with the  European Central Bank  lowering its
benchmark  interest rate  July 5, according to the median of 57
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  In Japan, the Tankan index of manufacturers’ sentiment
improved to minus 1 in June from minus 4 in March, the  Bank of
Japan  said today in Tokyo. The median estimate of 19 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a reading of minus 4. A
negative number means pessimists outnumber optimists.  Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101)  jumped 2.4 percent to 214 yen in Tokyo
after company President Yasumi Kudo said freight-forwarding and
warehousing businesses led by unit Yusen Logistics Co. will
boost sales to 800 billion yen ($10 billion) within seven years.  Aristocrat Leisure slumped 11 percent to A$2.45 in Sydney
as the company reported preliminary first-half profit of between
A$30 million ($30.7 million) and A$33 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
