Acquisitions of German home
portfolios rose in the first half as institutions sought safer
investments amid  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Investors bought about 7 billion euros ($8.8 billion) of
homes grouped into at least 50 apartments in the first six
months of 2012, about 170 percent more than a year ago,  CBRE
Group Inc. (CBG)  said in a statement today. Non-Germans made about a
third of the purchases, the Los Angeles-based broker said.  “Investors continue to view the German apartment market as
one of the safest and most attractive investment markets in the
world,” Konstantin Luettger, head of German residential
investment at CBRE, said in the statement.  Transaction volumes were lifted by four large deals
announced this year, including  Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI) ’s purchase of
 Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s Baubecon unit for about 1.2 billion euros. The
value of deals will probably exceed 10 billion euros by the end
of the year, bringing it close to levels last reached in 2008,
CBRE said.  Demand is strongest in Berlin, where municipalities are
among the bidders and prices are rising, according to CBRE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
