Abound Solar Inc., a solar-module
maker with $70 million in debt guaranteed by the U.S.
government, filed to liquidate.  Abound, based in Loveland,  Colorado , has more than
$100 million each in debt and assets, according to a petition
filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. The company filed
under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which is typically
used by companies that plan to shut down and liquidate.  In 2010, the company said it won a repayment guarantee from
the U.S. for as much as $400 million in loans. Such guarantees
typically mean the U.S. will pay off the debt if the borrower
cannot. Abound used the backing to borrow $70 million, the
Energy Department said in a June 28  statement .  “When the floor fell out on the price of solar panels,
Abound’s product was no longer cost competitive,”  Damien LaVera , an Energy Department spokesman, said in a statement on
the agency’s website.  Abound’s bankruptcy follows Solyndra LLC’s failure last
year after receiving a $535 million loan guarantee.  The case is In Re Abound Solar, Inc, 12-11972, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
