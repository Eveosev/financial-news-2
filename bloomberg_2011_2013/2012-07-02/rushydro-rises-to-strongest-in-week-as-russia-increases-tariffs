OAO RusHydro,  Russia ’s largest
hydropower company, advanced to the strongest level in almost
two weeks as the government raised power tariffs after an 18-
month freeze.  RusHydro climbed 3.4 percent to 81.56 kopeks by the close
in Moscow, the highest since June 19. The shares have slumped 16
percent this year.  Russia raised  gas prices  15 percent yesterday and regulated
electricity prices for residential households by 6 percent,
according to an e-mailed note by UralSib Capital. Electricity
distribution tariffs rose 8 percent and transmission tariffs
climbed 11 percent, according to UralSib.  “We see the tariff growth in the utilities sector as a
positive sign following an 18-month freeze on tariffs,” UralSib
analysts led by Matvey Taits, said in an e-mailed research note.
“We also see RusHydro, with a zero fuel expense, benefiting on
the  electricity market , as the wholesale electricity price will
be driven by the growth of the domestic gas price.”  Russia’s President  Vladimir Putin  delayed tariff increases
to slow inflation before his March 4 election bid. MSCI Inc.’s
Russia utilities Index has slumped 23 percent this year.  -- Editors: Alex Nicholson, Linda Shen  To contact the reporter on this story:
