Ethanol futures rose to a three-month
high in  Chicago  as dry, hot weather in the U.S. raised costs for
the corn used to make the biofuel.  Prices gained as above-normal  temperatures  blanket the
corn-rich U.S. Midwest, threatening crop development for the
grain and ethanol feedstock. Negative margins to make the fuel
have beleaguered producers this year, causing  Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO) , the third-biggest maker of the additive, to idle output
at two distilleries.  “This is weather, weather and more weather,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “It’s important to
keep in mind that you’re already losing ethanol production.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery advanced 5.9 cents, or
2.6 percent, to $2.292 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest price since March 23. Futures have gained 4 percent
this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.31 a gallon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In
Chicago, the additive lost 2.5 cents to $2.22.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slipped 2.5 cents to $2.295 a
gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel increased 2.5 cents to
$2.405.  Corn for December delivery increased 21.75 cents, or 3.4
percent, to $6.565 a bushel in Chicago.  One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
