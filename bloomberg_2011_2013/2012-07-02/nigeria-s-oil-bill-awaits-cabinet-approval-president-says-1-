Nigeria’s Petroleum Industry Bill
will be sent to lawmakers after approval by the cabinet,
President  Goodluck Jonathan ’s office said.  Jonathan has told relevant government ministries to
evaluate the draft, prepared by a technical committee before
presentation to the Cabinet, according to a statement e-mailed
late yesterday by the Abuja-based presidency.  The bill, which may be presented to parliament in two
weeks, resolves all previous concerns raised by international
producers, including fiscal terms and domestic gas pricing, the
Lagos-based  ThisDay  newspaper reported yesterday.  The bill was first sent to parliament in December 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
