The European Union will unveil
tougher rules for banks that safeguard investment funds’ assets
as part of a push to prevent a fraud similar to the  Ponzi scheme 
orchestrated by  Bernard Madoff .  The European Commission, the 27-nation EU’s executive arm,
will publish the measures tomorrow in a package of draft laws on
retail financial services, according to  a statement  on the
authority’s website. The proposals will include pay rules for
managers of EU-regulated funds known as UCITS.  Under the rules, banks and other institutions that act as
so-called depositaries for UCITS will “have an incentive to pay
a lot of attention to the information they provide and the
services they offer,”  Michel Barnier , the EU’s financial
services chief, said in an interview on June 28.  Madoff, 74, pleaded guilty in 2009 to orchestrating what
prosecutors called the biggest Ponzi scheme in history and is
serving a 150-year sentence in U.S. federal prison. The fall-out
of the fraud included the liquidation of four UCITS funds, a
type of investment vehicle targeted at retail investors that is
allowed to operate across the EU.  Luxembourg has been the center of more than 100 lawsuits
over Madoff-related funds. The country is the second-largest
mutual fund market after the U.S. with about 3,874 registered
funds holding 2.2 trillion euros ($2.8 trillion) in assets as of
May.  Millions Lost  Investors who lost millions of dollars through Access
International Advisors LLC’s  LuxAlpha Sicav-American Selection (LUXAMSB) 
vehicle and Luxembourg Investment Fund filed complaints against
 UBS AG (UBSN) , the custodian for at least some of the funds, in
Luxembourg. Lawsuits were also filed against  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s
local unit, custodian for the third Madoff-linked fund, Herald
(Lux) US Absolute Return.  The three Luxembourg funds were dissolved in 2009.
LuxAlpha, the biggest of the three, invested 95 percent of its
assets with Madoff and had $1.4 billion in net assets a month
before Madoff’s December 2008 arrest. A fourth, Dublin-based
Thema International Fund Plc, had $1.1 billion in assets before
the arrest.  The EU’s proposal will set how banks and other depositary
institutions should carry out their safe-keeping and oversight
duties, as well as establishing common rules on liability.  Sanctioning Powers  It would also ensure that national regulators have the
power to impose fines and other sanctions on funds and
depositaries that break the rules.  The plans must be approved by national governments and by
lawmakers in the European Parliament before they can enter into
force.  Rules on how UCITS managers are compensated are designed to
mitigate the threat that they could be tempted to take excessive
risks to boost profits, Barnier said.  The rules will include limits on the size of a manager’s
bonuses relative to fixed salary, according to an EU official.
They would also curb the extent to which pay is linked to short-
term performance, said the official, who couldn’t be named
because the plans aren’t yet public.  A separate proposal, to be published tomorrow, would force
sellers of insurance to disclose more details about how they are
paid, the official said. The commission will also set out
minimum information that retail customers should be provided
when deciding whether or not to take part in an investment fund.  OTC Derivatives  Separately, Barnier said that he is confident of reaching
an agreement with the U.S. over the scope of over-the-counter
derivatives trading rules.  Barnier wrote to U.S. regulators in April urging them to
delay enforcing rules on EU banks amid concerns that the
measures could overlap with European requirements and create
unnecessary costs.  “I think the message I sent was understood and now we’re
working on it,” he said. “I have confidence that it will be
resolved, and that we will reach a deal to accept each others’
rules as equivalent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
