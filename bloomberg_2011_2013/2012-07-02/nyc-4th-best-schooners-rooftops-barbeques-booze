After a long day in the sun, the best
way to see the  Macy’s 4th of July Fireworks  is to hop on a small
boat with friends and share a couple of pops while you watch the
pyrotechnics.  Taking its first Independence Day voyage, the Schooner
America 2.0 is the newest addition to  Classic Harbor Line ’s
fleet.  Munch on hors d’oeuvres as you sample unlimited local craft
beers, like Fire Island Lighthouse Ale, and wines from the
Finger Lakes and Hudson Valley.  The 105-foot vessel is a replica of the yacht that won the
first America’s Cup Race in 1851. Cutting-edge technology makes
this version fast and light with minimal impact on the
environment.  The cruise leaves from Pier 62 and lasts just under three
hours. Schooner America is $425 per person; prices for other
boats in the fleet range from $275 to $375 per person.  Information: +1-212-627-1825;  http://www.sail-nyc.com .  Ink48 Hotel  One of my favorite spots on the West Side is  Press Lounge 
at the top of Ink48 Hotel.  The views from the huge terrace are spectacular -- you’ll
see the party on the  Intrepid  just below -- and the fireworks
reflecting off the nearby buildings will be a show in itself.  For the holiday, there’s an open bar, passed hors d’oeuvres
and a buffet dinner, including fresh and fried oysters, tempura
shrimp, crab salad, barbequed chicken and skirt steak.  The event, which runs from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. costs $325.  At 653 11th Ave. Information: +1-212-757-2224;

festivities is at  Chelsea’s Table  at  Chelsea Piers .  The two-month old cafe is serving an  unlimited buffet  of
organic hot dogs, beef sliders, pasta and grilled corn for $75
for adults and $25 for children.  Drinks are not included, but raspberry lemonade spiked with
Rain Organic Vodka is on offer, along with beer and wine.  Limited outdoor seating is available, and indoor seating
may offer views of the fireworks, but the ticket also includes
access to other parts of  Chelsea Piers  for more viewing options.  Owned by Gary Hirshberg, the man who brought the world
 Stonyfield Farms  organic yogurt, Chelsea’s Table is located at
Pier 62.  From 6 p.m. until the fireworks end. Information: +1-646-
560-5251;  http://chelseastable.com .  Lustgarten Benefit  I’ll be on Fire Island but if I weren’t, I’d go to  The
Lustgarten Foundation ’s benefit at Toyota and Scion of
 Manhattan .  Held on the dealership’s 7th floor rooftop, the benefit
($75 prepaid, $100 at the door) gets you a sensational view of
the fireworks, and an all-you-can eat barbeque, ice cream and
open bar extravaganza.  A Scion xB will be  raffled  off, with 100 percent of the
proceeds going to pancreatic  cancer research .  From 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. at 645 11th Ave. Information: +1-

236th birthday and Highpoint Bistro’s 2nd birthday by having
dessert first: try a beer float made from Session Premium Black
Lager and vanilla ice cream for $10.  The restaurant is celebrating with a clam bake, including
lobster, clams, mussels, red bliss potatoes and all the fixings
for $26.  Located at 216 7th Ave, between 22nd and 23rd Streets.
