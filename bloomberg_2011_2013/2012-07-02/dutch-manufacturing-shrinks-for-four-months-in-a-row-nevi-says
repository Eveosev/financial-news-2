Manufacturing in the Netherlands in
June remained below the 50 mark for a fourth consecutive month,
indicating a contraction, according to the Dutch institute for
purchasing and supply management, NEVI.  The measure of manufacturing in the fifth-largest economy
in the euro region rose to 48.9 from 47.6 in May, 
Zoetermeer, Netherlands-based NEVI said on its website today.
The institute cited a drop in domestic orders, a slight increase
in unemployment and a general worsening of the economic
situation.  The index is based on a survey of about 350 purchasing
managers by Markit Economics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
