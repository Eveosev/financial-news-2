Sina Corp. (SINA) , the Chinese operator of
the Twitter-like Weibo service, retreated to the lowest level
since January after Maxim Group LLC reduced the company’s
revenue forecast.  Shanghai-based Sina lost 3.4 percent to $50.07 at the close
of trading in New York, the lowest since Jan. 9.  Sina will probably report sales of $547 million this year,
Echo He, an analyst at Maxim Group in New York, wrote in an e-
mailed report today. He’s previous forecast was for $560
million. Maxim’s He also lowered the 12-month target price on
the shares to $44 from $45.  “The slowing economy is starting to put pressure on online
advertising budgets,” He said in a phone interview. “It’s hard
for Internet companies like Sina to grow in this environment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
