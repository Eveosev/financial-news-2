CME Group Inc. (CME)  fined Whiteside Energy
LP $225,000 after a trader at the Houston-based firm left an
automated trade execution system unattended, contributing to
disruptive price movements in the July 2011 natural gas
contract.  Steven Vu, a trader with Whiteside, was fined $25,000. Both
Whiteside and Vu agreed to the fines without admitting or
denying CMEâ€™s findings, CME Group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
