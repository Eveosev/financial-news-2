Switzerland ’s President Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said the nation’s central bank can continue to
intervene in foreign-exchange markets “for as long as it
wants” and that the only limit to franc sales would be
inflation.  Widmer-Schlumpf, who is also Switzerland’s finance
minister, said at a news conference today that the  Swiss
National Bank  remains independent and “decides alone which is
the right level for the Swiss franc.”  Swiss policy makers imposed a ceiling of 1.20 francs per
euro to protect the country’s economy on Sept. 6 after the franc
reached near parity with the euro, prompting the SNB to purchase
euros to stem any appreciation in the currency above that level.
Central bank President Thomas Jordan in May said controls on
capital inflows were among additional measures being considered
by a government-led panel to stop the franc from strengthening.  “The national bank can’t fail,” Widmer-Schlumpf said,
adding that “we are prepared to take other measures.”  She also said that the Swiss government “is prepared for
the worst, but I don’t think we have to do that.” Inflation
would be the only restraining factor on the SNB’s intervention
and “if we would have inflation I think they would have to stop
that.”  The Swiss president also said a dispute with the U.S. over
undeclared accounts held by U.S. taxpayers in Swiss banks may be
resolved before the U.S. elections in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
