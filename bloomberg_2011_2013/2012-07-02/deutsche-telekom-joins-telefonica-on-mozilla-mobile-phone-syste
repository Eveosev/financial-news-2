Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and  Sprint Nextel
Corp. (S)  will join  Telefonica SA (TEF)  in developing an open mobile
operating system powered by Mozilla Corp. to build out a range
of cheaper smartphones and take on  Google Inc. (GOOG)   Telefonica, Spain’s biggest phone company, will offer the
first handsets running the software in Brazil in early 2013
after previously saying the devices will be available this year,
according to an e-mailed statement today. Chinese manufacturers
 ZTE Corp. (762)  and  TCL Communication Technology Holdings Ltd. (2618)  will
build the devices, the statement said.  Telefonica teamed up with Mozilla, the developer of the
Firefox web browser, on a rival operating system to Google’s
Android system to regain more control over the software that
powers smartphones. By adding operators, the partners are
seeking to build out a viable platform. Deutsche Telekom, Sprint
Nextel,  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) ,  Telenor ASA (TEL)  and Etisalat are backing
the open Firefox system, according to today’s statement.  “Firefox OS will deliver a higher performance than current
low cost smartphones can achieve,” said Matthew Key, chief
executive officer of Telefonica’s digital unit. “This is
crucial for us to accelerate the adoption of smartphones in
developing markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
