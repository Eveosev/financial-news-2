Tat Konserve Sanayii AS (TATKS) , a maker of
canned and frozen fruits and vegetables, fell after saying it
will stop livestock breeding activities at one of its units.  The shares lost 0.9 percent to 2.10 liras at 10:55 a.m. in
Istanbul, paring the gain this year to 14 percent.  The company is terminating activity at its unit Harranova
Besi & Tarim Urunleri AS due to performance and market
conditions, Tat said in a statement to the  Istanbul Stock
Exchange  after the market closed June 29. The livestock business
has a 5 percent share in Tatâ€™s annual sales, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
