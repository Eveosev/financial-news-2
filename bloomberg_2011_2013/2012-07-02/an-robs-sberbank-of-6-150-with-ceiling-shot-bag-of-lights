An armed gunman robbed a branch of
OAO Sberbank in southwest Moscow after firing into the ceiling
and fled after distracting bystanders with a device resembling a
bomb, Russia’s largest lender and police in the capital said.  The man forced a teller to hand over what amounted to about
200,000 rubles ($6,150) and then escaped after tossing an open
bag on the floor that contained “flashing lights and wires,”
the Moscow division of the  Interior Ministry  said in a statement
on its website.  Nobody was harmed and the money was insured, Sberbank said
in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
