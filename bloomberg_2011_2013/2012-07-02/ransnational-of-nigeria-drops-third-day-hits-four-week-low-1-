Transnational Corp. of Nigeria Plc ,
which has investments in hotels, agriculture and oil, declined
for a third day, reaching a four-week low.  The stock fell 4.6 percent to close at 1.03 naira in Lagos,
the commercial capital, the lowest since June 4. The shares
almost tripled from May 10 to June 14, declining just one
trading day in that period.  “Some investors who bought it when the price started going
up are now selling because they have realized that the gestation
period could be longer than they anticipated,” Raheem Mohammed,
chief operating officer of Lagos-based Kundila Finance Ltd.,
said by phone today.  Transcorp plans to build eight hotels that trade under the
Hilton brand in  Africa ’s most populous country to take advantage
of a surge in business visitors, Chief Executive Officer Obinna Ufudo said on May 25. First-quarter net income rose 62 percent
to 518.6 million naira ($3.2 million), the company said on May
24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
