Jumptap Inc. , a mobile advertising
network that competes with Google and Millennial Media, said
today it raised $27.5 million, which will be used to improve its
products and technology ahead of an initial public offering.  It’s the seventh round of funding for the 7-year-old
company, which has raised a total of $121.5 million, according
to Jumptap. The latest round included previous investors General
Catalyst Partners, Redpoint Ventures, Summerhill Venture
Partners, Valhalla Partners and WPP, as well as new investor
Keating Capital, as reported on Bloomberg.com’s Tech Deals blog.  It’s been nearly two years since Chief Executive Officer
George Bell joined Jumptap and started refocusing the company on
targeted mobile advertising, instead of mobile search products.
Out of a staff of about 80, he cut half and then aggressively
hired. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company now has about
150 employees. Revenues last year grew 60 percent, according to
Bell.  The company has partnered with data providers to categorize
audiences by characteristics such as demographics, location and
behavior, Bell said. The company continues to test and refine
new technology, he said.  “It’s a little like a very long-term experiment that you
just have to keep trying things and keep the faith that you’re
going to get some grapefruit,” he said in an interview last
month. “I’ll joke with our venture capitalists that what they
gave us was a research grant.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
