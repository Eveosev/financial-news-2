The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in Australia from non-payment declined, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia  index  dropped 2 basis points to
175 basis points as of 10:20 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  prices show. The index fell 11 basis points yesterday and
has traded between 211 and 128 this year, according to data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia  index  of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 2 basis points to 170 as of 8:17
a.m. in Singapore, Standard Chartered Plc prices show. The
index, which has ranged between 210 and 132.5 this year, had
fallen for five consecutive days prior, according to CMA, which
is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan  index  was little changed at 173
basis points as of 9:30 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
