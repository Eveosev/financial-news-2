Cielo SA (CIEL3) , Brazilâ€™s biggest card-
payment processor, fell after saying it agreed to buy Merchant
e-Solutions for $670 million to expand in the U.S.  Cielo declined 0.6 percent to 58.70 reais at the close of
trading in  Sao Paulo , after earlier retreating as much as 2.3
percent. The benchmark Bovespa index jumped 0.6 percent.  Merchant e-Solutions processes traditional, e-commerce and
mobile payments totaling more than $14 billion a year, Cielo
said today in a regulatory filing.  Cielo has risen 46 percent this year, the second-best
performer on the Bovespa, which lost 3.6 percent in the same
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
