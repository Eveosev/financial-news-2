DP CleanTech, a Chinese biomass and
waste-to-energy business, won a contract to build a facility in
the  Philippines  that will use rice husk, rice straw and
woodchips to produce power.  DP CleanTech will build the 12-megawatt power plant for
AseaOne Power Corp., the Beijing-based company said today in an
e-mailed statement. The value of the contract wasnâ€™t disclosed.
Construction of the plant in the Aklan province is expected to
start in October and it may begin working in April 2014,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
