Barclays Plc (BARC)  Chief Executive Officer
 Robert Diamond  said he has the full support of the bank’s non-
executive directors and pledged to stay and implement the
recommendations of a review into its Libor submissions.  “No one is more sorry, disappointed and angry about these
events than I am,” Diamond wrote in a letter to employees
today. “We all know that these events are not representative of
our culture, and it is my responsibility to get to the bottom of
that and resolve it.”  Diamond said the bank will get to the bottom of what
happened, pledged to bolster the controls surrounding the firm’s
submissions to the London interbank offered rate and take
“appropriate action” against those involved with rigging the
benchmark interest rate.  “Of course, given the nature of the authorities involved,
the investigations were accompanied by criminal inquiries, and
some of those are still underway,” Diamond said. “We have the
full range of tools at our disposal, from clawing back
compensation to asking people to leave the bank.”  Marcus Agius today resigned as chairman in a bid to shield
Diamond after the bank was fined a record 290 million pounds
($455 million) for rigging  interest rates . Michael Rake, who was
today named deputy chairman, will oversee an inquiry into the
bank’s business practices, the London-based lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
