The Philippine peso climbed to an 11-
month high after European leaders announced measures to ease a
regional debt crisis, bolstering demand for emerging-market
assets.  Government bonds  gained.  The peso strengthened for a fifth day, its longest winning
streak in almost five months, and the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of
shares rose to a seven-week high. Philippine President  Benigno
Aquino  approved a 10 percent jump in government spending to
2.006 trillion pesos ($48 billion) in 2013, Budget Secretary
Butch Abad said today.  “The Europe resolution eliminated some uncertainties and
triggered appetite for risk,” said  Jonathan Ravelas , chief
market strategist at Manila-based  BDO Unibank Inc. (BDO)  “Rising
government spending is helping create a very strong economic
environment, which is good for the currency.”  The peso appreciated 0.3 percent to 42.018 per dollar as of
the close in Manila, prices from Tullett Prebon Plc show. It
earlier touched 41.95, the strongest level since Aug. 2, 2011.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, was unchanged at 6.3 percent.  European leaders dropped a requirement that governments get
preferred-creditor status on crisis loans to Spanish lenders
during a two-day summit that ended June 29. Spanish and Italian
bonds rallied after the announcement, paring losses for the
second quarter.  The yield on the Philippine government’s 5.75 percent bonds
due November 2021 slid three basis points to 5.275 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
