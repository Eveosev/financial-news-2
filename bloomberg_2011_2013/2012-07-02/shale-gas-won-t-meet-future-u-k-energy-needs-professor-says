Natural gas from shale deposits won’t
be developed fast enough in the U.K. to meet future energy
needs, according to the University of Leicester.  Britain should cut its reliance on gas because prices are
set to rise as demand increases from China and  India , Mike
Bradshaw, professor of geography at the university, will say
today at a Royal Geographical Society conference in Edinburgh.
Significant exploitation of shale resources won’t happen for
“many years,” because of logistical and environmental hurdles,
he will say, according to an e-mailed statement from the
society.  The U.K. has more natural gas trapped in shale rocks than
 Iraq  has in its traditional reserves, according to shale
explorer Cuadrilla Resources Ltd., which suspended drilling last
year after causing minor earthquakes. It said in May that it
plans to resume work this year and begin production in 2014.  “Shale gas is unlikely to be a game changer in the U.K.,”
Bradshaw will say.  Hydraulic fracturing, the process known as fracking in
which water, sand and chemicals are pumped underground to break
apart rock formations and release gas, should be allowed to
resume in the U.K. as long as “robust” measures are adopted to
safeguard against future risks, an independent report
commissioned by the Department of Energy and Climate Change
recommended in April.  Fracking can be carried out safely in the U.K. if it’s
effectively regulated, the Royal Society and the  Royal Academy 
of Engineering said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
