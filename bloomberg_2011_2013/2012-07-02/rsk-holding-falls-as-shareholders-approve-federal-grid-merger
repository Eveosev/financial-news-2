OAO MRSK Holding (MRSK)  retreated after
shareholders approved its transfer under Federal Grid Co.’s
management.  The country’s largest electricity distribution company
dropped 1.2 percent to 1.757 rubles by the close in Moscow. The
Micex added 1.1 percent to 1,402.74.  MRSK shareholders approved the transfer at a meeting on
June 30, according to a statement today.  “The outcome still has to be decided and so that implies
various scenarios,” VTB Capital analysts led by Mikhail Rasstrigin, said in an e-mailed research note. “Low visibility
over future corporate actions and the downbeat tariff outlook
complicate the investment case.”  -- Editors: Alex Nicholson, Linda Shen  To contact the reporter on this story:
