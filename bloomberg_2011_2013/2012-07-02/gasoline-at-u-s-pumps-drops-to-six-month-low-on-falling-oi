Gasoline pump prices in the U.S.
dropped to a six-month low amid falling oil prices and slowing
economic growth, a government report today showed.  The price for regular gasoline, averaged nationwide, fell
8.1 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $3.356 a gallon today from a week
ago, according to the Energy Department’s Energy Information
Administration. The price was 6.2 percent below year-ago levels,
a  report  posted on the agency’s website shows.  U.S. gasoline is at its lowest point since Jan. 2, when it
averaged $3.299 a gallon. It’s down 15 percent from this year’s
peak of $3.941 a gallon on April 2 after crude fell 18 percent
in May and 2.2 percent last month. crude accounts for about 66
percent of the cost of gasoline, according to the department.
Refineries restored output following seasonal maintenance,
sending gasoline inventories to a seven-week high, department
data show.  “Prices are still reflecting, in general, lower crude
prices,” said  David Hackett , president of Stillwater Associates
in  Irvine ,  California , an independent fuel consultant. “If
there’s any increase in crude prices, it’ll take some time
before that change gets reflected at the street level.”  Crude fell today after the biggest rally in three years on
concern that economic weakness in the U.S. and  Europe  will
reduce demand. Oil for August delivery fell $1.21, or 1.4
percent, to $83.75 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.
Prices jumped 9.4 percent on June 29 on speculation that
European Union leaders will contain the region’s debt crisis.  Stockpile Gain  Motor-gasoline inventories  climbed 2.1 million barrels, or
1 percent, to 204.8 million in the week ended June 22, according
to the department. That’s the highest level since May 4.  Citgo Petroleum Corp. finished a maintenance turnaround at
the 165,000-barrel-a-day Corpus Christi oil refinery in  Texas ,
the company said in an e-mailed statement June 25. Citgo’s
170,500-barrel-a-day Lemont plant also restored production after
finishing a turnaround that began around May 1, according to a
June 12 statement.  Average U.S. gasoline demand  for the four weeks ended June
22 dropped 4.8 percent from a year earlier to 8.83 million
barrels a day, department data show.  Gasoline fell the most this week in the Midwest region,
where prices dropped 10.8 cents to $3.323 a gallon, today’s
report shows.  The Energy Department conducts a telephone survey of about
800 retail gasoline outlets across the U.S. each Monday to post
weekly gasoline prices as of 8 a.m. local time that day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
