A plan by  Kuwait  to construct a
4 billion-dinar ($14 billion)  oil refinery  and upgrade two
existing ones attracted bids from five international companies
to provide consultation services,  Al-Rai  reported, citing
unidentified oil officials.  The bidders are  Foster Wheeler AG (FWLT) ,  Fluor Corp. (FLR) ,  Technip SA (TKPPY) ,
 Amec Plc (AMEC)  and Worley Parsons Energy Services LLC, the newspaper
said.  Kuwait National Petroleum Co., the state-run refiner, will
finish evaluating the bids by the end of the month, Al-Rai said,
adding that the new refinery will have a capacity of 615,000
barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
