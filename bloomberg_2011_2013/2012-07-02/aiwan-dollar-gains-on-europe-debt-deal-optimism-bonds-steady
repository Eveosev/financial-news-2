Taiwan’s dollar touched the strongest
level in a week after European leaders agreed on measures to
tackle the region’s debt crisis.  Government bonds  were steady.  The  Taiex (TWSE)  index of shares rose for a second day after euro-
area officials dropped requirements that taxpayers get preferred
creditor status on aid to Spain’s banks and relaxed conditions
on potential help for Italy. The gauge has plunged more than 10
percent since reaching a 2012 high on March 2. Foreign funds
sold $271 million more of the island’s shares than they bought
last week, exchange data show.  “Stocks were slightly up today, reflecting on the progress
in  Europe  last week,” said  James Wang , a debt trader at Yuanta
Securities Co. in Taipei. “But you can see the Taiex is still
pretty much in dead water and that’s going to continue to
support bonds.”  The currency was little changed at NT$29.905 against its
U.S. counterpart at the close after reaching a one-week high of
NT$29.80, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was steady at 3.90 percent.  Taiwan’s  export orders  declined for a third month in May
and the jobless rate climbed, official data showed last month.  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 was
1.227 percent, compared with 1.229 percent on June 29, according
to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight interbank lending
rate  was steady at 0.506 percent, according to a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
