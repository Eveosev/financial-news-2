(Corrects timing of meeting with president in second
paragraph.)  Mexico presidential candidate Enrique Pena Nieto, who preliminary data show is the winner of
yesterday’s election, said he’s “convinced” he’ll reach an
agreement on opening Mexico’s energy sector with opposition
parties in Congress.  Pena Nieto will meet with President  Felipe Calderon  after
July 8 to discuss the transition between governments, he said
during an event today in Mexico City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
