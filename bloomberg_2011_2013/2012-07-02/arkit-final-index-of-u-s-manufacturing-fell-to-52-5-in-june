The Markit Economics final  index  of
U.S. manufacturing decreased to 52.5 in June from 54 in May, the
London-based group said today.  A reading above 50 in the purchasing managers’ measure
indicates expansion. The final figure, based on a survey of more
than 600 companies, compares with an initial reading on June 21
of 52.9.  The Markit gauge of U.S. manufacturing was released in May
for the first time. The company surveys purchasing managers in
more than 30 countries and regions, including Europe and  China .
Its  euro-area manufacturing  index held in June to 45.1, the 11th
straight month of contraction. A gauge of China’s manufacturing
fell to 48.2 last month from 48.4, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
said.  Commerce Department figures last week showed U.S. orders
for goods meant to last at least three years rose 1.1 percent in
May, the first increase since February, easing concern that
business investment in the world’s largest economy is faltering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
