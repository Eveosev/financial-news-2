Japanese  stocks  rose, with the  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average headed for its highest close in almost two
months, after manufacturing gauges in Japan and China topped
estimates and European agreements on the debt crisis lifted
investor confidence.  Nissan Motor Co. rose 1.2 percent after a  Bank of Japan 
survey showed the country’s largest makers of cars and
electronics were less pessimistic than economists expected.  TDK
Corp. (6762) , a maker of electronic parts which gets almost 30 percent
of its revenue from China, gained 1.6 percent after an official
measure of mainland manufacturing growth beat estimates. Nippon
Yusen K.K. jumped 3.4 percent on a plan to double sales at the
shipping line’s logistics operations.  The Nikkei 225 rose 0.4 percent to 9,040.35 as of 12:34
p.m. in Tokyo, set for the highest close since May 9. The  Topix (TPX) 
Index added 0.3 percent to 772.12, with three shares rising for
every two that fell. The measure rose for a fourth day as the
yen weakened against the euro and Spanish and Italian bond
yields fell after last week’s European summit.  “Markets are shifting to a risk-on mood,” said Hiroshi
Fujimoto, a  fund manager  at Tokyo-based Shinkin Asset Management
Co., which oversees the equivalent of $6.6 billion. “There’s a
lot less uncertainty about the European situation, at least in
the near term.”  The Topix has rebounded about 11 percent since June 4, when
the index fell to its lowest level since 1983. Stocks rose after
Greek voters elected pro-bailout parties and European leaders
struck deals to contain the debt crisis.  Shares on Japan’s broadest equities gauge traded at an
average of 1.1 times book value, compared with 2.2 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.4 times for the Europe Stoxx
600 Index. A number less than one means that companies can be
bought for less than value of their assets.  S&P Futures  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  slid 0.1 percent today. The
gauge jumped 2.5 percent, the most in 2012, on June 29 after
European leaders agreed to relax conditions on emergency loans
for Spanish banks and make it easier to recapitalize the
region’s troubled lenders.  “Investors are now in a situation to take risks,” said
 Hideyuki Ishiguro , assistant manager of investment strategy at
Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo. “The  European Central Bank  may
lower interest rates this week.”  Economists expect the ECB to lower its benchmark  interest
rate  by at least 25 basis points to a record low of 0.75 percent
on July 5, according to the median estimate of 57 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Japan’s Tankan  Makers of cars and electronics rallied after the central
bank’s quarterly Tankan index of sentiment among large
manufacturers rose to minus 1 in June from minus 4 in March. The
median estimate of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was
for a reading of minus 4. A negative number means pessimists
outnumber optimists.  Nissan (7201) , Japan’s second-biggest carmaker by sales, advanced
1.2 to 757 yen. Toshiba Corp. which makes computers, home
appliances and nuclear  power plants , climbed 1.7 percent to 305
yen.  Companies that do business in China rose after a government
manufacturing gauge dropped less than economists expected. The
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index fell to 50.2 in June from 50.4 in
May, the Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said. The number beat the
49.9 median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of analysts. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  TDK climbed 1.6 percent to 3,250 yen. Murata Manufacturing
Co., an electronic-parts maker that gets the highest proportion
of sales in China among Topix Index companies, rose 1.8 percent
to 4,230 yen.  Nippon Yusen  jumped 3.4 percent to 216 yen after President
Yasumi Kudo said freight-forwarding and warehousing businesses
led by unit Yusen Logistics Co. will boost sales to 800 billion
yen ($10 billion) within seven years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
