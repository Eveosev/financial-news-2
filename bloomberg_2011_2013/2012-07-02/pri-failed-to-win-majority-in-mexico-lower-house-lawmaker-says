Mexico’s  Institutional Revolutionary
Party , or PRI, and the allied  Green Party  won’t get a majority
in the nation’s Chamber of Deputies, a PRI lawmaker said after
yesterday’s presidential and congressional elections.  With more than  90 percent  of the votes counted, the PRI
alliance will have about 241 lawmakers in the 500-seat lower
house, said Jorge Ramirez Marin, the second in command of PRI
presidential candidate Enrique Pena Nieto’s campaign.  “We’ll have to work a lot in the construction of
consensus,” Ramirez Marin said in a telephone interview from
Mexico City. “We’ll have take a lot of time in talks with the
parliamentary forces.”  Pena Nieto has said that if elected he plans to spur growth
by making it easier for companies to hire and fire workers,
increasing tax collection and encouraging more businesses to
join the formal economy. He also aims to open up the oil
industry to more private investment.  Ramirez Marin, a former president of the lower house from
September 2010 to September 2011, said it’s more “viable and
logical” to push for the labor initiative as the lower house
has already discussed the issue. “We can even approve it
immediately,” Ramirez Marin said.  Changes to energy and fiscal legislation will probably take
more time, Ramirez Marin said, without offering details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
