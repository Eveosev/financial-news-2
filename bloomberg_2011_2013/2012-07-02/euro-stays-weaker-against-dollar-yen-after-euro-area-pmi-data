The euro stayed weaker against the
dollar and the yen after a report confirmed an index of
manufacturing in the euro-region contracted for an eleventh
month in June.  The 17-nation shared currency traded 0.3 percent weaker at
$1.2631 as of 9:08 a.m. London time, and declined 0.5 percent to
100.58 yen.  A gauge of euro-region manufacturing held at 45.1 in June,
London-based Markit Economics said today in a final estimate.
That compares with an initial estimate of 44.8 on June 21. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
