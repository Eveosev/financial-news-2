Thailand’s baht and Indonesia’s
rupiah led gains among Asian currencies as Europe’s progress on
solving its debt crisis revitalized demand for regional stocks.  Overseas investors bought more equities than they sold in
Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand on June 29 after
European officials relaxed conditions on bailout loans for Spain
and said banks can be recapitalized directly. The  MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares added to last week’s biggest rally since
January. China’s manufacturing expanded in June, while analysts
had forecast a contraction, according to data issued yesterday.  “The market has reacted positively to the good news out of
the European summit, but the concern over growth remains,”
 Nizam Idris , head of Asian fixed income and currencies at
Macquarie Bank Ltd. in  Singapore , said in an e-mail. “To some
extent, one can say the Chinese Purchasing Manager’s Index
numbers were better than feared, but the general direction of
travel in terms of global growth remains on the downside.”  The baht rose 0.5 percent to 31.58 per dollar as of 3:47
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
rupiah rose 0.5 percent to 9,386 and the peso appreciated 0.3
percent to 42.018. Most Asian currencies fell last quarter as
the financial crisis in Europe cut demand for regional exports
and raised concern global economic growth is slowing.  Indonesia’s overseas shipments fell for a second month,
shrinking 8.5 percent in May from a year earlier, figures showed
today. India’s rupee slid 0.1 percent to 55.7150 as data showed
exports dropped 4.2 percent.  China Boost  The Chinese  yuan  rose to a one-month high. The  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index fell to 50.2 in June from 50.4 in May, the
Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation
of Logistics and Purchasing said yesterday. That compared with
the 49.9 median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  The yuan advanced 0.08 percent to 6.3490 per dollar and
earlier touched 6.3461, its strongest level since May 29. It
slid 0.88 percent last quarter, its worst performance since a
peg to the U.S. currency ended in 2005.  “People generally think domestic activity bottomed out in
the second quarter,” said Andy Ji, a Singapore-based foreign-
exchange strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia. (CBA)  “The PMI
is a little piece of evidence of that. The yuan may resume its
appreciation trend again.”  South Korea’s won traded near an eight-week high after a
surge in the  trade surplus  to $4.96 billion, the most since
October 2010. The currency slid 0.1 percent to 1,146.04 at the
close in  Seoul  on speculation importers are buying the dollar to
settle bills.  “The large trade surplus and the European summit results
will have a considerably positive effect on the won during the
beginning of the week,” said Kim Doo Hyun, chief currency
trader at  Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  in Seoul.  Elsewhere, Malaysia’s ringgit appreciated 0.2 percent to
3.1637 and the Taiwanese dollar was little changed at NT$29.905.
The Vietnamese slid 0.1 percent to 20,895.  To contact the reporter on this story:
