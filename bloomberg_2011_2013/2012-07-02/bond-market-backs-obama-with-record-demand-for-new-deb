Investors are plowing cash into new
U.S. Treasuries at a record pace, making economic growth rather
than budget austerity a key issue as President  Barack Obama  and
 Mitt Romney  face off in November’s presidential election.  Bidders offered $3.16 for each dollar of the $1.075
trillion of notes and bonds  auctioned  by the Treasury Department
this year as yields reached all-time lows, above the previous
high of $3.04 in all of 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The so-called bid-to-cover ratio was 2.26 from 1998
to 2001 when the nation ran budget surpluses.  Even as Romney and fellow Republicans assail Obama for
presiding over the increase of U.S. publicly-owned  debt  to $10.5
trillion from $5.75 trillion in 2009 amid the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression, the  bond market  is showing
growing investor confidence in the safety of dollar assets.  “The perceived stability of the U.S. financial system,
where you have an active and aggressive  Federal Reserve , and a
broad $15 trillion-plus economy means the U.S. is going to
continue to be regarded as a deep, liquid, strong area to invest
in,” Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of fundamental fixed
income at New York-based Blackrock Inc., which manages $3.68
trillion, said in a June 29 telephone interview. “Rates are
going to stay low for a long time.”  Yields Lower  Yields on 10-year Treasury notes declined three basis
points last week, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.65 percent and
have fallen from 1.88 percent at the end of 2011 and this year’s
high of 2.4 percent on March 20. The benchmark 1.75 percent
security due May 2022 rose 8/32, or $2.50 per $1,000 face
amount, to 100 30/32. The government sold $29 billion of seven-
year notes at a record low yield of 1.075 percent on June 28.  The 10-year note yield declined seven basis points to 1.58
percent at 2:20 p.m. in  New York , according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices.  The 3 percent return on Treasuries in the second quarter
exceeded the 2.25 percent return on company debt and the 1.11
percent gain for mortgages, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch bond indexes. The S&P 500 stock index  dropped  3.3 percent
last quarter while the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of
 raw materials  fell 7.9 percent.  Demand for new issues from the  U.S. Treasury  has
accelerated as investors seek assets in the world’s reserve
currency. The dollar has gained 6 percent against the euro and 2
percent against the British pound since the end of March as
 Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis worsened, the U.K. entered
another recession and U.S. growth cooled.  Dollar Haven  Risk-adjusted returns, which account for volatility, show
Treasuries topped other major sovereign debt markets including
Germany, the U.K., Japan,  Canada  and  Switzerland , data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The dollar had the second highest risk-
adjusted return after the Japanese yen since March 31.  The  dollar  is a “haven and if you’re going to buy dollars
you’re by and large going to be investing in Treasuries,”  James Kochan , chief fixed-income strategist in Menomonee Falls,
Wisconsin, at Wells Fargo Funds Management LLC, which manages
$232 billion, said in a June 28 telephone interview. “They’re
really one and the same trade.”  Even as the bond market rallies, politicians have made
reducing the budget  deficit  a top issue for November’s election.
Obama and Republican challenger Romney have each pledged to cut
spending with the budget deficit poised to exceed $1 trillion
for a fourth year and  debt  rising to 69.4 percent of gross
domestic product from 37.5 percent in 2008.  Government Spending  Romney has slammed Obama for expanding borrowing to fund
budget deficits, a $787 billion fiscal stimulus package and
loans to General Motors Co. and Chrysler Group LLC, likening the
rise in  U.S. debt  to a prairie fire visible in the distance.  “You don’t say, ‘I’m going to go to bed, because the wind
might change,’ you instead look for someone that says, ‘I’m
going to take responsibility and fix this -- put it out,’”
Romney said on May 16. “It’s high time that we have a president
that will stop this spending and borrowing inferno, and I
will.”  The government’s budget deficit through May was $844.5
billion, the smallest at this point in the fiscal year since
Obama has been in office. The shortfall was $1.3 trillion in
fiscal 2011 ended Sept. 30.  The decision by the Fed and Chairman Ben S. Bernanke to
hold borrowing costs at about zero since December 2008 combined
with $1.3 trillion of bond purchases helped to reduce government
and private sector borrowing costs. Interest expense on the
deficit was 3 percent of the economy in fiscal 2011, down from 4
percent in 1999, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Rising Ratio  The bid-to-cover ratio has  risen  from $2.50 during Obama’s
first year in office in 2009. The ratio was $2.99 in 2010, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Rising demand for government debt has pushed down borrowing
costs for companies and individuals. Average yields on
investment and speculative-grade corporate bonds fell to 4.23
percent last week from more than 5.65 percent in early 2010,
based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The average rate
for a 30-year  mortgage  has fallen to 3.66 percent from more than
5.5 percent in 2009, according to a Freddie Mac survey.  Investors are hanging on to dollar assets. Average weekly
 trading volume  since April among the 21 primary dealers was
$530.8 billion, or 5.1 percent of the amount outstanding. That’s
down from $649 billion in June 2007, or 15 percent of the $4.3
trillion outstanding. Back then, the 10-year note yield reached
5.32 percent.  Term Premium  By some measures, Treasuries are  overvalued . The term
premium, a model created by economists at the Fed, was negative
0.86 on June 26, near the record low of negative 0.94 on June 1.
A negative reading indicates investors are willing to accept
yields below what’s considered fair value.  An investor buying the current 10-year note would lose 7
percent, including interest, if the yield rose to the 2.5
percent median estimate of more than 60 economists and
strategists surveyed by Bloomberg by mid-2013.  “One of the ideas that the market is very complacent about
is that rates could actually go up,” said Kathleen Gaffney, co-
manager of the $20.9 billion Boston-based Loomis Sayles Bond
Fund, in a June 28 telephone interview. “When they move, they
move very fast.”  A lasting solution to Europe’s debt turmoil might send
rates up. Global stocks jumped, with the MSCI All-Country World
index soaring 3.03 percent on June 29 after a meeting in
Brussels of EU leaders ended with officials paving the way for
cash-strapped financial institutions to tap Europe’s bailout
fund directly once they establish a single banking supervisor.  Falling Yields  Yields on Italy’s 10-year bonds tumbled 38 basis points to
5.82 percent, while those in  Spain  plunged 61 basis points to
6.33 percent.  For all the progress, it might take several months or a
year to implement the plans, according to German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel , and may not be enough, said Italian Prime
Minister  Mario Monti . Two rescue funds, the European Financial
Stability Facility and the yet-to-start European Stability
Mechanism, may only amount to about 20 percent of the debt of
Italy and Spain.  “As long as Europe continues to make headlines with its
bailout process, which is taking much longer than the market
would like it to, we should continue to see a bullish
underpinning to Treasuries from that flight to quality
dynamic,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government bond strategist at CRT
Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , in a June 26
telephone interview.  Slowing Growth  Obama said June 8 that the slowing European economy was
dragging down U.S. growth. Gross domestic product in the U.S.
rose 1.9 percent in the first quarter, reflecting an increase in
 consumer spending  that now shows signs of cooling as the labor
market weakens, the Commerce Department said June 28.  The median forecast of 70 economists in a Bloomberg survey
is for 2012 growth of 2.2 percent, below the 2.7 percent average
from 2002 to 2007. The Fed has cut its projections for 2013 six
times since January 2011. That level of expansion won’t be
robust enough to cut an  unemployment rate  that has remained
above 8 percent for 40 months before next year, according to the
central bank’s forecasts.  The economy faces the prospect of diminished fiscal
stimulus, with $1.2 trillion in automatic federal spending cuts
poised to take effect at year-end.  “Investors have generally looked through the fiscal
cliff” of expiring George W. Bush tax rates and mandatory
spending cuts, as well as “the deficit position and overall
debt issues with respect to the U.S,”  Christopher Sullivan , who
oversees $1.9 billion as chief investment officer at United
Nations Federal Credit Union in New York, said in a June 29
telephone interview. “The first choice among investors in terms
of flight-to-quality or safety is the U.S.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
