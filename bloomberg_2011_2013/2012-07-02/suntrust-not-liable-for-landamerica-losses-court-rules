SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI)  isn’t liable for
losses connected with the bankruptcy of LandAmerica Financial
Group Inc., a federal appeals court ruled.  A three-judge panel in Richmond, Virginia, today upheld a
lower court ruling that dismissed claims by about 400 former
clients of LandAmerica who allege SunTrust “aided and abetted”
misconduct and engaged in a fraud conspiracy.  The plaintiffs invested money in LandAmerica 1031 Exchange
Services Inc., or LES, in order to avoid having to pay  capital
gains  taxes on properties that sold for profit. They allege
Atlanta-based SunTrust continued to assist LES in processing
investor transactions after learning that LES was facing
“major” liquidity problems.  “The fact that SunTrust allowed LES to continue to make
deposits into and withdrawals from the 3318 account is a far cry
from the concerted action necessary to evince a decision to
conspire in the defrauding of the exchangers,” according to the
court’s opinion.  Clients of LandAmerica were able to avoid capital gains
because the company bought their property and then put the money
into other similar investments. SunTrust handled LandAmerica’s
accounts.  LandAmerica owned what had been the third-largest group of
title insurance companies in the U.S. It filed for Chapter 11
protection in November 2008 and confirmed a plan one year later.
The plan created a trust designed to bring lawsuits.  Michael McCoy , a SunTrust spokesman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail message seeking comment on the ruling.  The lead case is Terry v. SunTrust Banks Inc., 11-1704,
 U.S. Court of Appeals  for the  Fourth Circuit  (Richmond).  To contact the reporter on this story:
