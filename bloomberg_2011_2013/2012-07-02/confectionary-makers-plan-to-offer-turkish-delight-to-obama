Turkeyâ€™s confectionary makers will
offer U.S. President  Barack Obama  and other world leaders
Turkish delight in an effort to win a wider market for the
product.  Producers of the cubes of confections based on a gel of
sugar or starch and including pistachios or nuts and known as
Lokum in Turkish, will spend 3.8 million liras ($2.1 million) to
have world leaders taste it through campaigns worldwide, said
Zekeria Mete, head of the Turkish Promotional Group for
Confectionaries, in an emailed statement.  Turkish confectionary products worth $2.05 billion were
exported last year, mostly to the Middle East, Africa and  South
America , Mete said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
