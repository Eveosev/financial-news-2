Cielo SA (CIEL3) , Brazil’s biggest card-
payment processor, agreed to buy Merchant e-Solutions for $670
million to expand in the U.S.  Merchant e-Solutions processes traditional, e-commerce and
mobile payments totaling more than $14 billion a year, Cielo
said today in a regulatory filing.  In May 2011, Cielo acquired Braspag - Tecnologia em
Pagamento Ltda. to boost its processing of online payments in
Brazil.  Cielo fell 47 centavos, or 0.8 percent, to 59.08 reais in
 Sao Paulo  trading on June 29. The stock has rallied 47 percent
this year, compared with a 4.2 percent drop for Brazil’s Bovespa
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
