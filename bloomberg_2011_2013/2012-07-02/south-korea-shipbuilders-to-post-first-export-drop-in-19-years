South Korean shipbuilders, who
account for about 10 percent of the nation’s exports, may post
their first annual drop in overseas shipments in 19 years after
a slump in orders during the global financial crisis.  Full-year exports of ships and offshore products may fall
to $43 billion from a record $54.5 billion in 2011, the  Ministry
of Knowledge Economy  said in an e-mailed reply to Bloomberg News
questions yesterday. The value of first-half deliveries declined
20 percent to $25.5 billion, based on preliminary data, it said.  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. (009540) , the world’s largest shipyard,
and other Korean shipbuilders are handing over fewer vessels
this year after the credit crunch and falling freight rates
caused orders to collapse from late 2008 into 2009. The yards,
which take about three years to deliver vessels, are also
focusing more on offshore equipment and larger ships that take
longer to build, suggesting exports will rebound in 2013, said
Um Kyung A, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. in  Seoul .  “The credit crisis pretty much wiped out orders in 2009
and that’s now starting to show,” she said. “It should get
better next year when a lot of the offshore and big container-
ship orders start to be delivered.”  The drop in ship and offshore project deliveries
contributed to South Korean exports falling in four of the first
six months of the year. The won has also dropped about 6.9
percent in the past year against the dollar, the third worst
performance among 11 major Asian currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  Trade Balance  “Ship exports greatly affect  South Korea ’s total
exports,” said Suh Jung Wook, head of research at  Korea
Development Bank , in Seoul. “The impact on the  trade balance  is
also great, given that there’s very few components imported from
overseas.”  Ships, offshore units and components were South Korea’s
biggest export category last year with $54.5 billion of sales,
based on  Korea Customs Service  data. Oil products were the
second-largest segment at $59.6 billion.  Global ship orders plunged 69 percent from a year earlier
in 2009 to 56.7 million deadweight tons, the least since the
beginning of boom of 2002, according to Clarkson data. Of that
total, South Korean yards won contracts for 19.2 million
deadweight tons, 72 percent less than in 2008.  Hyundai Heavy, Samsung Heavy Industries Co. and  Daewoo
Shipbuilding (042660)  & Marine Engineering Co., the world’s three biggest
shipyards based in South Korea, all missed their order targets
in 2009.  Hyundai Heavy fell 0.4 percent to 256,500 won in Seoul
trading yesterday. The Ulsan, South Korea-based shipbuilder is
little changed this year, compared with an 8.9 percent gain for
Daewoo Shipbuilding and a 37 percent jump for Samsung Heavy.  LNG Facilities  Hyundai Heavy doesn’t have any major deliveries scheduled
for this year. In 2013, it will hand over processing facilities
totaling $2.06 billion for a  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  liquefied-natural-gas
project in  Australia .  Daewoo Shipbuilding also doesn’t have any significant
deliveries pending this year. In 2013, it plans to hand over two
18,000-container ships to A.P. Moeller Maersk A/S. The vessels
are among 20 ordered by the Copenhagen-based shipping line that
will be the largest cargo-box ships afloat. It will also deliver
a $1.8 billion floating oil production vessel to Total SA next
year.  South Korean shipyards won orders for $11.7 billion of
vessels in the first five months of the year, 50 percent less
than a year earlier, according to Clarkson data. The tally,
which excludes offshore equipment, was more than triple the $3.6
billion of orders won by yards in  China , based on the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
