The ruble depreciated the most in a
week after oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, fell as European
unemployment climbed to a record.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 32.5997 per
dollar by the close in Moscow, its steepest decline since June
22. The ruble weakened 9.2 percent in the second quarter.  Crude oil retreated 2.3 percent to $83.02 a barrel in  New
York . Oil and gas contribute about 50 percent of Russia’s state
revenue. Euro-area unemployment reached the highest on record,
with the jobless rate in the 17-nation euro area rising to 11.1
percent in May from 11 percent in April, data showed today.
Russia’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index slid to 51 from 53.2 in May,
HSBC Holdings Plc said in a statement today, citing data
compiled by London-based Markit Economics.  “Locals maintain a bearish view,” Vladimir Kolychev,
chief economist at Societe Generale SA’s OAO  Rosbank (ROSB)  unit in
Moscow, said by e-mail.  The Russian currency strengthened 0.4 percent to 40.9775
per euro and was little changed at 36.3697 against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket. Investors increased bets on
the currency weakening, with non-deliverable forwards showing
the ruble at 33.1100 per dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 32.9915 per dollar on June 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
