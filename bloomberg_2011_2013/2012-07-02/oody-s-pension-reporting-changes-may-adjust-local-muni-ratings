Moody’s Investors Service plans to
adjust how it reports U.S. state and local government pension
data, according to a request for comment released today.  The changes “likely would result in rating actions for
those local governments where the adjusted liability is outsized
for the rating category and without mitigating factors such as
demonstrated flexibility to respond to higher fixed costs,” the
New York-based ratings company said in the report.  The new criteria aren’t expected to result in rating
changes for states, according to the report. In January, the
company downgraded  Illinois  to A2, its lowest grade for a state,
in part because of its “severe pension under-funding.”  The company is seeking comment on the usefulness of the
changes in increasing comparability among state and local
pensions, and in treating retirement liabilities similarly to
debt. Moody’s will consider four main adjustments, according to
the report:  To contact the reporters on this story:
