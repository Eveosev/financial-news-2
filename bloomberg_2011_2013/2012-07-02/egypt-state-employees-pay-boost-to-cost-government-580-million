Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi
ordered that the pensions of military personnel be raised by 15
percent instead of an earlier proposal of 10 percent, the
official Middle East  News Agency  reported.  Earlier, the  finance ministry  said that yesterday’s
decision to give state administrative workers a 15 percent pay
increase would cost the country 3.5 billion pounds ($580
million). The ministry was in discussions with the Ministry of
Social Affairs on how to fund a separate 15 percent increase in
pensions that was approved for workers yesterday, Finance
Minister Momtaz el-Saieed said in a statement e-mailed by the
ministry.  Mursi, who was sworn in as  Egypt ’s first freely-elected
president on June 30, has said he wants to raise workers’ wages
as part of a broader social justice program. Mursi assumed a
post whose authority had been diluted by the generals that took
over after  Hosni Mubarak ’s ouster last year. The Muslim
Brotherhood, from whose ranks Mursi was drawn, has been locked
in a power struggle with the military.  Mursi had earlier ordered that the pensions for armed
forces personnel be raised by 10 percent, MENA reported, citing
Mursi’s spokesman, Yasser Ali.  To contact the reporter on this story:
