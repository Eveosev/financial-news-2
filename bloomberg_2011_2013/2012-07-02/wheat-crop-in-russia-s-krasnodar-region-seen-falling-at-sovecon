The wheat crop in  Russia ’s Krasnodar
region, the country’s top grain-growing area in 2011, will fall
by 2.4 million to 2.5 million metric tons from last year,
SovEcon said.  The southern region’s wheat harvest probably will come to
4.6 million to 4.8 million tons this year, the Moscow-based
researcher  said  on its website today. The predicted reduction is
linked to a 23 percent drop in yields because of crop losses
caused by frost and drought, SovEcon said.  Farmers in Krasnodar reaped 11.4 million tons of grains
last year, or 12.2 percent of the national crop, according to
government statistics. This year’s harvest probably will come to
8 million to 8.5 million tons, said Eduard Kutygin, the local
agriculture and refining industry minister, according to a
statement on the regional administration’s website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
