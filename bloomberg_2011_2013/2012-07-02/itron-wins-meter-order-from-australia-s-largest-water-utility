Itron Inc. (ITRI) , the largest U.S.-based
maker of water meters, won a supply contract from the biggest
Australian water utility to replace meters for Sydney Water’s
4.6 million customers.  Itron, based in Liberty Lake, Washington, said in a
statement that the company began the three-year installation of
high-efficiency meters yesterday. No terms were disclosed.  Itron shares have gained 16 percent this year.  On June 29, the U.K. investment company  Melrose Plc (MRO)  agreed
to buy  Elster Group SE (ELT)  for $2.3 billion to access gas- and
power-meters for advanced electricity grids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
