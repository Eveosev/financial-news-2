Stockton,  California , which last week
became the biggest U.S. city to seek court protection, will
begin a historic effort this week to be the first American city
to use bankruptcy to successfully impose losses on bondholders.  Lawyers for Stockton are to appear in  U.S. bankruptcy court 
in  Sacramento  July 6 for the initial hearing in the case. City
council members have set aside more than $3 million for the
first year of a bankruptcy court fight with bondholders and
labor unions over how to divide a smaller budget.  No U.S. municipality has used bankruptcy to force
bondholders to take less than the full principal due since at
least 1981, and possibly as far back as the 1930s, according to
lawyers and court records.  “We’re trying to spread the pain, unfortunately, to others
besides employees,” Stockton City Manager Bob Deis told council
members at a June 26 hearing. Before the June 28 bankruptcy
filing, Stockton officials said they would try to impose cuts on
all creditors.  The municipal  bond market  will be watching to see if that
goal is met, said Jim Spiotto, a bankruptcy attorney with
Chapman and Cutler LLP who helped write a book about
municipalities in financial distress.  “That’s what everybody is going to be watching,” Spiotto
said in a telephone interview. “What’s the stigma for it?
What’s the price? Do you trade a short term gain for a long term
pain?”  Municipal Bankruptcies  Of the 43 municipal bankruptcies filed since 1981, 33 were
either dismissed by a judge, or failed to win a court ruling
discharging their debt. Court records for the remaining 10 did
not list the disposition. Spiotto said none of those cases ended
with a cut to the principal owed lenders.  “Whenever there’s a bankruptcy or default, there’s a
psychological twinge that goes through the issuer community and
the market,”  Tom Dresslar , a spokesman for California Treasurer
Bill Lockyer, said in a telephone interview. “If other issuers,
including the state, are stained as a result of Stockton’s
bankruptcy then potentially when we go to market we suffer the
consequences.”  During negotiations in the months leading up to the
bankruptcy, bondholders “were grossly unhappy with the city’s
proposal,” Joe Rose, an attorney for the city’s biggest labor
union, said in an interview. Rose was part of the negotiations,
which were required under a state law governing when cities can
file bankruptcy.  First Municipality  The California city of Vallejo, about 65 miles west of
Stockton, became the first municipality to use bankruptcy to cut
the interest rate paid to its lender, Union Bank NA, Spiotto
said.  Stockton listed assets of more than $1 billion and debt of
$500 million to $1 billion in court filings. The Chapter 9
petition allows Stockton, a city of 292,000, to suspend payments
to creditors while it seeks court approval for a plan that
balances revenue with debt.  The two biggest creditors named in the filing reflect the
groups most likely to face cuts imposed as part of the
bankruptcy: bondholders and city employees.  Stockton said its biggest unsecured creditor is the
 California Public Employees’ Retirement System , or Calpers, the
largest U.S. pension fund, owed $147.5 million, followed by
 Wells Fargo (WFC)  Bank NA, as trustee for $124.3 million in pension
obligation bonds, and Wells Fargo as trustee for three other
sets of bondholders owed $107 million, according to court
papers.  ‘Active Role’  Wells Fargo “expects to take an active role in the
bankruptcy proceedings,”  Elise Wilkinson , a spokeswoman for the
San Francisco-based bank, the nation’s biggest home lender, said
in an e-mail the day Stockton filed bankruptcy.  The bank didn’t lend the city any money, she said.  “All our efforts in the bankruptcy proceedings will be
directed toward achieving a recovery for the holders of Stockton
bonds,” she said.  Stockton is the biggest city to file bankruptcy, by
population. The biggest of all municipal bankruptcies, by debt,
was filed by Jefferson County,  Alabama , last year.  Jefferson County owes creditors about $4.2 billion,
according to court records, and like Stockton is trying to force
bondholders to take less.  Jefferson County  Unlike Stockton, Jefferson County’s bonds are tainted by
claims of political corruption. In 2009,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
agreed to a $722 million settlement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission over payments its bankers allegedly made to
people tied to county politicians to win business.  Cities have avoided trying to force investors to take a
loss in court, or out, because the bond market would punish any
future borrowings with higher  interest rates , or possibly by
locking them out entirely, said  Richard Ciccarone , chief
research officer at McDonnell Investment Management LLC in  Oak
Brook ,  Illinois .  Since the 2008 financial and housing crisis, the number of
municipalities filing bankruptcy has increased. Eleven of the 43
to file since 1981 came after the crisis started.  Spiotto and Ciccarone said they cannot identify any large
municipalities that haven’t fully repaid principal since the
Great Depression in the 1930s. In that era, about 4,000
municipalities defaulted, with about 40 of those not fully
repaying the debt.  Housing Market  The collapse of the housing market left Stockton to contend
with mounting retiree health-care costs and an eroding tax base
in the wake of the recession, amid accounting errors that
overstated municipal revenues.  Stockton began negotiations with creditors March 27. They
were extended to June 25. Calpers, Wells Fargo and bond insurer
 Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO)  were among at least 18 creditors involved
in the failed talks.  Assured Guaranty  has insured $161.4 million worth of
Stockton’s bonds, the company said in a statement. Insured
bondholders “remain fully protected,” the company said.  “Assured Guaranty intends to vigorously enforce its rights
as a creditor in any Chapter 9 proceeding, including the right
to contest eligibility and confirmation of any plan of
adjustment proposed by the city,” the company said in a
statement e-mailed by Ashweeta Durani, a company spokesman.  The case is In re Stockton, 12-32118, U.S.  Bankruptcy Court
