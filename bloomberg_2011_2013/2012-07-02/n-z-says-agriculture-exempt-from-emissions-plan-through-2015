New Zealand will keep agricultural
 carbon emissions  out of its carbon trading plan until at least
2015 to reduce costs on the nation’s producers, Climate Change
Minister Tim Groser said.  “The government remains committed to doing its part to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions but it is worth noting that we
are the only country outside  Europe  with a comprehensive
emissions trading scheme,” Groser said in an e-mailed statement
today. “In these times of uncertainty, the government has opted
not to pile further costs on to households and the productive
sector.”  The government’s amendments to its plan follow a review
begun in 2011, and also include maintaining a cap on the price
companies will face if carbon costs begin to rise
internationally. Prime Minister John Key undertook the review
because the original schedule wasn’t being matched by other
nations with whom  New Zealand  competes in export markets.  Much of New Zealand’s carbon emissions are from farm
animals, so inclusion of agriculture in the plan would have
pushed up costs for farmers, who are already paying more for
fuel and energy after the plan was applied to those industries
in mid-2010.  Applying more costs on agriculture in New Zealand would
undermine the nation’s competitiveness, Fonterra Cooperative
Group Ltd., the world’s biggest dairy exporter, said in a
statement. Overseas sales of dairy products make up a quarter of
all exports, which in turn comprise 30 percent of the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
