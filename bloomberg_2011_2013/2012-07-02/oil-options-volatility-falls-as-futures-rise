Crude-oil options volatility rose to
the highest level in two weeks and underlying futures fell as
manufacturing contracted in the U.S. and  China  and euro-region
unemployment rose to a record.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 34.93 a barrel at 1:35 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , up from 30.74 percent on June 29.  Crude oil for August delivery dropped $1.81, or 2.1
percent, to $83.15 a barrel at 1:43 p.m. on the Nymex. Today’s
loss followed a jump of $7.27 on June 29 as futures surged the
most since March 2009.  “Volatility is up quite a bit,” said Fred Rigolini, vice
president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  “We saw end-
of-the-quarter buying coming in on Friday and now, coming in
after that, you’re seeing profit-taking based on some of the
sluggish economic numbers.”  Futures declined today as the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s  factory index  for the U.S. slid to 49.7 in June
from 53.5 in May, the first contraction since July 2009. Chinese
manufacturing indexes slipped to seven-month lows, while euro-
area  unemployment  reached the highest level on record, rising to
11.1 percent in May from 11 percent in April, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said.  Most Active  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
