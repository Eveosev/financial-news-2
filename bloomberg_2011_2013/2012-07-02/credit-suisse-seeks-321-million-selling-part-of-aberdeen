(Corrects to remove reference to size of Credit Suisse’s
remaining stake in final paragraph.)  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  is selling
part of its stake in  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN) ,  Scotland ’s
largest money manager, to raise as much as 205 million pounds
($321 million), according to two people with knowledge of the
transaction.  The Zurich-based lender is selling as many as 80.4 million
Aberdeen shares for 245 pence to 255 pence each, a discount of
as much as 7.4 percent to the closing price today, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the process is
private.  The Swiss central bank said last month in its annual
financial stability report that Credit Suisse has to increase
its capital “substantially” this year. Pressure on earnings
from weaker client activity is making it harder for the bank to
accumulate capital and prepare for stricter regulatory
requirements.  The Swiss bank is reducing its stake in Aberdeen as the
money manager’s stock gained about 25 percent this year,
compared with an increase of 1 percent in the U.K. benchmark
FTSE 100 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Credit Suisse is selling about 7 percent of the company in
the offering, according to a termsheet for the sale obtained by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
