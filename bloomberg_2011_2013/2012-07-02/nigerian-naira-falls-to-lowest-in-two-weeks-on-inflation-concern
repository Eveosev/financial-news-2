The naira weakened against the dollar
as concern inflation may accelerate slowed inflows and as oil,
the country’s key export, retreated.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer fell as much
as 0.4 percent in the  interbank market  and traded 0.1 percent
lower at 162.55 per dollar by 3:10 p.m. in Lagos, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The naira is down 0.3 percent this
year, after being Africa’s best-performer against the dollar in
the first five months.  While  inflation  slowed to 12.7 percent in May from 12.9
percent in April, the rate is set to peak at 14.5 percent in the
third quarter, the highest since April 2010, according to the
 Central Bank of Nigeria . Policy makers have held the  benchmark
interest rate  at 12 percent this year to curb the naira’s
decline and combat inflation, after raising it by 5.75
percentage points in 2011. The nation’s benchmark bonny light
crude fell to $97.32 a barrel today, from $128.47 on March 13.  “While seasonal month-end sales should provide support to
the naira over the next few days, dollar liquidity is expected
to dwindle as investors continue to shy away from the domestic
 capital market  amid concerns over rising inflation and a
potential slump in the oil price,” Celeste Fauconnier and Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana, strategists at Rand Merchant Bank, wrote in a
report today.  Nigeria sold 84 billion naira of bonds ($515 million),
including 30 billion naira of debt due 2017, with bids down 13
percent for that maturity to 55.84 billion naira, according to
the debt management agency.  Auctions  The central bank sold $350 million at a foreign-currency
auction today, matching the amount sold on June 27, at 155.94
naira per dollar, the Abuja-based bank said in an e-mailed
statement. The regulator sold $700 million at auctions last week
in efforts to support the naira. The oil industry, which sells
dollars to lenders around the month-end to meet local expenses,
is the second major supplier after the central bank.  The yield on  Nigeria ’s domestic 15.1 percent bonds due 2017
rose 14 basis points to 16.19 percent, according to June 29 data
on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on
the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 fell three basis
points to 5.55 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi appreciated 0.2 percent to 1.935 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
