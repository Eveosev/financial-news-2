Italyâ€™s jobless rate unexpectedly
fell from a 12-year high in May, the first decline in more than
a year.  The  unemployment rate  decreased to a seasonally-adjusted
10.1 percent, from 10.2 percent in April, Rome-based national
statistics office Istat said in a preliminary report today. It
was the first decline in the jobless rate since February of last
year. Economists forecast an increase to 10.3 percent, the
median of eight estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey showed.  Joblessness among people aged 15 to 24 rose to 36.2
percent, from 35.3 percent, Istat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
