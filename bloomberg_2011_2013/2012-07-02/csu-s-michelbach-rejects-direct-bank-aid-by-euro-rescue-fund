Euro-area countries should avoid
recapitalizing banks from the region’s rescue fund without
running the aid through governments, said Hans Michelbach, a
lawmaker in German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition.  Michelbach’s comment in an e-mailed statement today
challenges a June 29 agreement by euro-area leaders allowing
direct aid to banks once a European banking supervisor is set
up.  Michelbach, a member of the Bavaria-based Christian Social
Union party, said European Union countries that don’t overhaul
their finances don’t deserve preferred treatment, referring to
Italy and  Spain .  “If Italy and Spain had good budget management and
governance, these countries wouldn’t have problems with
refinancing,” said Michelbach, a member of the German
parliament’s finance committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
