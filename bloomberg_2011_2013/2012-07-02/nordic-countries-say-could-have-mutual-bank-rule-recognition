The Nordic countries could establish
a system of mutual recognition of bank capital requirements for
exposures incurred in a neighboring country, the Nordic finance
ministries said today in a statement on the Norwegian Finance
Ministry’s website.  If implemented, the system could imply that if one country
was to implement stricter capital requirements the other Nordic
countries would “accept that these requirements were to apply
for all relevant exposures incurred in that country” by all
Nordic institutions operating there, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
