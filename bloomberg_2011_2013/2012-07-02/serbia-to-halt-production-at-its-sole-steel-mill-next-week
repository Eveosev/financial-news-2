Serbia  will temporarily halt
production at  Zelezara Smederevo d.o.o. , its only steel plant,
and may restart one of its two furnaces in September.  Production will be halted from July 10 to Sept. 1 because
“at this moment it is economically justified and the best
solution,” spokeswoman Tijana Koprivica said in a phone
interview in Belgrade today. Efforts to sell Zelezara continue
after the government bought back the mill from  U.S. Steel Corp. (X) 
earlier this year. The management said last week it would shut
down the plant for at least three months to cut losses.  “The company is of strategic importance for Serbia,”
Koprivica said after Economy Minister Nebojsa Ciric met with the
managers and union leaders from the unprofitable, state-owned
steel mill east of Belgrade.  The government has twice extended the deadline in a tender
for the mill’s sale, giving potential investors until Sept. 10
to make an offer.  Former owner U.S. Steel halted one of the two furnaces last
year. The plant makes hot- and cold-rolled steel products  and
has operated at less than a half of its annual capacity of 2.2
million tons for more than two years, according to the company
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
