An Israeli aircraft fired at a target
in southern Lebanon,  Al Jazeera  said. The United Nations
peacekeeping force in the area said it was looking into the
report.  “Our military on the ground are checking these reports
about the alleged explosion,” Andrea Tenenti, spokesman for the
United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL), said in a
telephone interview.  An Israeli army spokeswoman, speaking on condition of
anonymity in accordance with military regulations, said as a
matter of course the army declines to comment on foreign news
reports.  South Lebanon is a stronghold of Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim
militant organization backed by Syria and  Iran  and designated a
terrorist group by the U.S. The group last fought  Israel  in a
month-long conflict in 2006.  “The enemy detonated an explosive device remotely against
a telecommunication line in Zrariyeh” village, Hezbollah’s
television channel, Al Manar, reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
