Three cargoes of Russian Urals crude
were dropped from the loading program for July, according to
three people with knowledge of the shipping schedule.  One shipment of 140,000 metric tons for July 19 to July 20
loading from the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk and two 100,000-
ton consignments for July 14 to July 15 and July 23 to July 24
from Primorsk on the  Baltic Sea  were canceled, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the information is
confidential.  All three cargoes were owned by TNK-BP, the Russian oil
producer half-owned by  BP Plc (BP/) , according to a loading plan
released last week.  Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments compiled
by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their
supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
