Indian stocks dropped for the first
time in five days as some investors judged a recent rally
excessive.  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , the largest cigarette company, fell the most in
eight weeks after reports that Uttar Pradesh state raised taxes
on tobacco products.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the nation’s biggest
truckmaker and owner of Jaguar Land Rover, dropped to a two-week
low after June sales declined.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , the
largest household products maker, decreased 1.7 percent.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, retreated 0.2
percent to 17,398.98 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The gauge
earlier swung between gains and losses at least 10 times. Its
14-day relative strength index, a measure of how rapidly prices
rose or fell during the specified period, was 68 on June 29.
Some investors see readings of more than 70 as a signal to sell.  “Investors are taking a breather given the superb rally we
had last month,” said Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit
BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd. in Kochi. “They are waiting
for some trigger, which could come from more reform measures by
the prime minister to boost economic growth.”  Indian stocks jumped the most in Asia in June on optimism
Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  will accelerate the government’s
reform agenda after he took over the country’s  Finance Ministry 
on June 26. Singh, who will head the ministry until a successor
for  Pranab Mukherjee  is named, was finance minister in the
1990s, sparking a turnaround in the economy that now faces one
of its sternest tests.  Reform Pressure  Singh’s administration has seen its agenda stymied by
opposition from its own coalition allies, and last year
suspended a plan to allow  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  and other foreign
companies to open supermarkets. An anti-corruption bill and
proposals to allow foreign direct investment in pensions are
also stalled.  “There is hope that he will go quicker on reforms because
there is so much pressure from the media, analysts and
economists that we aren’t doing anything,” Nirmal Jain,
chairman of IIFL Ltd., a Mumbai-based brokerage, said in a
Bloomberg UTV interview on June 29.  The Sensex has gained 13 percent this year and trades at
13.7 times estimated earnings. Valuations sank to a three-year
low of 12.4 times on May 23 on concern slowing economic growth
will hurt corporate profits. The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index
trades at 10.1 times.  Nifty Futures  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. was little changed at 5,278.60, and its July futures
settled at 5,290.50. The BSE 200 Index climbed 0.2 percent to
2,142.83.  India VIX, a gauge of options prices in the Nifty, lost 0.4
percent to 19.01. Combined trading volume on India’s top two
bourses was 1.08 billion shares on June 29, about 20 percent
more than the 12-month daily average of 902 million.  ITC slumped 3.4 percent to 250.05 rupees, its steepest drop
since May 8. Tata Motors declined 1.9 percent to 237.95 rupees,
paring this year’s advance to 33 percent.  Hero Motocorp Ltd. (HMCL) ,
the biggest two-wheeler maker, lost 1.6 percent to 2,114.35
rupees, ending a four-day 5.8 percent rally.  Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP) , the second-biggest steelmaker by
market value, tumbled 2.9 percent to 456.9 rupees. The stock had
jumped 8.9 percent on June 29. Hindustan Unilever decreased 1.7
percent to 446.6 rupees.  Overseas  investors  sold a net $122.1 million of Indian
stocks on June 28, paring their investment this year to $8.5
billion, according to the nation’s market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
