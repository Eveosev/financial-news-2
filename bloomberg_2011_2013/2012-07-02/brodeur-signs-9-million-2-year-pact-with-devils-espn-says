Martin Brodeur  signed a two-year, $9
million contract to remain with the National Hockey League’s  New
Jersey  Devils, ESPN reported.  Brodeur, who has played his entire 18-year career with New
Jersey, was a free agent and received offers from teams
including the Toronto Maple Leafs and Chicago Blackhawks, the
Walt Disney Co. network said.  “I’m really happy,” Brodeur said in an  interview  with
ESPN. “Deep down what I always wanted was to re-sign with New
Jersey. I’m glad the Devils stepped up when they did.”  Brodeur, 40, was paid $5.2 million last season in the final
year of a six-year contract. He had a 31-21-4 record with a 2.41
goals-against average in 59 games last season. The Devils lost
to the  Los Angeles Kings  in the Stanley Cup Final.  Agent Pat Brisson, who was hired by Brodeur after the
season, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail about the
contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
