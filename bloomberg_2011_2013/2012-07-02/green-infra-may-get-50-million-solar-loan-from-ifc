The  World Bank ’s private-sector
financing arm may provide a $50 million loan to Green Infra Ltd.
to build two solar power plants in India.  The International Finance Corp. is considering offering the
funding over the next two years for a 20-megawatt project and a
five-megawatt plant in Rajasthan state, according to  a proposal 
dated June 29 on the lender’s website.  The projects will use thin-film photovoltaic panels,
according to the proposal, which didn’t name an equipment
supplier.  New Delhi-based Green Infra was formed in 2008 by the
private equity arm of Infrastructure Development Finance Co.,
one of India’s biggest lenders to power plants. It bought  BP
Plc (BP/) ’s Indian wind-energy portfolio of 100 megawatts the
following year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
