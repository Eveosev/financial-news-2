The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of
24  raw materials  fell 0.3 percent to settle at 597.4 at 4 p.m.
in New York, led by crude oil.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI index of 26  prices  declined 0.1
percent to 1,484.59.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil fell after manufacturing in the U.S. unexpectedly
shrank in June for the first time in almost three years.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. factory index
fell to 49.7 in June from 53.5 from the previous month. Euro-
area unemployment reached the highest on record in May,
government data showed.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , oil futures for August
delivery slid 1.4 percent to $83.75 a barrel.  Brent oil for August settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures  Europe  exchange fell 0.5 percent to $97.34 a barrel.  Mercuria Energy Trading SA bought a cargo of North Sea
Forties while Total SA and Morgan Stanley sought to purchase the
blend without success. No bids or offers were shown for Russian
Urals crude for a second day.  OAO Surgutneftegas, a Russian oil producer, sold three
Urals cargoes of 100,000 metric tons each via a tender to Royal
Dutch Shell Plc and Statoil ASA for loading from the Baltic Sea
port of Primorsk, according to three traders who participate in
the market.  BASE METALS  Copper declined the most in a week on concern that demand
is poised to slump as manufacturing deteriorates worldwide.  On the Comex in  New York , copper futures for September
delivery fell 0.8 percent to $3.469 a pound, the biggest drop
for a most-active contract since June 21.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months slid 0.8 percent to $7,625 a metric ton ($3.46 a pound).  Aluminum and zinc dropped, while tin, nickel and lead rose.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures declined as the dollar rebounded, eroding
demand for the precious metal as an alternative investment.  On the Comex, gold futures for August delivery fell 0.4
percent to $1,597.70 an ounce.  Silver futures for September delivery dropped 0.4 percent
to $27.499 an ounce.  On the Nymex, platinum futures for October delivery
advanced 0.4 percent to $1,458.30 an ounce. Palladium futures
for September delivery slumped 1.1 percent to $578 an ounce.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil declined as reports from the U.S.,  China  and
Europe signaled a slowing global economy will damp fuel demand.  On the Nymex, heating-oil futures for August delivery slid
1.3 percent to $2.6759 a gallon.  Gasoline futures for August delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$2.6239 a gallon.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas settled unchanged amid speculation that storm-
related blackouts in the eastern U.S. and the Fourth of July
holiday will reduce demand for the power-plant fuel.  On the Nymex, gas futures for August delivery closed at
$2.824 per million British thermal units.  U.K. gas for delivery tomorrow climbed as exports to
 Belgium  reached the highest in a month and Dutch imports
slumped.  Gas gained 0.3 percent to 56.65 pence a therm at 4:06 p.m.
London time. August gas was little changed at 55.75 pence a
therm. That’s equivalent to $8.74 per million Btu. A therm is
100,000 Btu.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Sugar climbed to a two-month high on supply concerns in
 Brazil , the world’s biggest producer and exporter.  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, raw sugar for October
delivery rose 1.9 percent to 21.4 cents a pound. Earlier, the
price reached 21.59 cents, the highest since April 26.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery increased 2.3
percent to $1.746 a pound.  Cocoa futures for September delivery fell $1 to $2,290 a
ton.  Orange juice  for September delivery slumped 3.6 percent to
$1.1735 a pound.  Cotton futures for December delivery rose 1 percent to
72.02 cents a pound.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn surged to the highest in almost three months, and
soybeans rose as hot, dry weather threatens to reduce yields in
the U.S., the world’s biggest producer of both crops.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for December
delivery jumped 3.3 percent to $6.5575 a bushel. The price
earlier reached $6.64 a bushel, the highest since April 9.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.7 percent to
$14.38 a bushel.  Wheat futures for September delivery gained 2 percent to
$7.725 a bushel.  LIVESTOCK  Hog prices rose to the highest in almost a year on signs
that hot weather in the U.S. will curb livestock weights and
deter producers from slaughtering animals reducing pork
supplies.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hog futures for August
settlement climbed 0.2 percent to 94.975 cents a pound. Earlier,
the price reached 96.325 cents, the highest since July 7, 2011.  Cattle futures for August delivery dropped 1 percent to
$1.19275 a pound, the biggest decline since June 13.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell 1.2
