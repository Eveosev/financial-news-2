Segro Plc (SGRO) , Europe’s largest publicly
traded industrial property specialist by value, agreed to buy 13
logistics buildings near Paris and Lyon for 160.8 million euros
($203 million) to bolster its position in France.  The company bought the properties from  Fonciere Europe
Logistique SCA (FEL) , a unit of Fonciere des Regions SA, London-based
Segro said in a statement today. The properties are spread
across eight estates, five of them near Paris, and generate 14.2
million euros of annual rental income, Segro said.  Chief Executive Officer David Sleath announced in November
a 1.4 billion-pound ($2.2 billion)  disposals program  to focus on
prime assets across Europe. He has used part of the proceeds to
make acquisitions, including December’s 315 million-pound
purchase of a 50 percent stake in the U.K. Logistics Fund.  The purchase announced today “provides us with a rare
opportunity to acquire some of the best logistics assets in the
two strongest markets in  France ,” Segro Chief Investment
Officer Phil Redding said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
