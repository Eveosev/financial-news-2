Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for a
second day as the central bank extended its policy of curbing
 money supply  through  repurchase agreements  and term-auction
deposits.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy appreciated
0.2 percent to close at 84.05 per dollar, extending its gains
this year to 1.2 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted 4.3 billion shillings
($51 million) in seven-day repurchase agreements at a weighted
average rate of 17.239 percent and 1.92 billion shillings of the
four-day securities at a rate of 16.239 percent, an official
with the Nairobi-based bank, who asked not to be identified in
line with policy, said by phone.  The bank also accepted 300 million shillings of 14-day term
auction deposits at 17 percent and 5 billion shillings in 28-day
deposits at 17.24 percent, according to the official. The sale
today is the fourth auction after the bank stayed out for five
days from June 20 through June 26, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Longer term auction deposits were introduced “as an
additional instrument for liquidity management,” the bank said
June 5.  Kenyan  inflation  slowed to a 15-month low in June,
declining for the seventh straight month to 10.1 percent from
12.2 percent in May, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics
said in an e-mailed statement June 29. Inflation is down from a
peak of nearly 20 percent in November. Kenya’s  central bank 
monetary policy committee, which raised the benchmark  interest
rate  to a record 18 percent last year to curb price gains and
support the shilling, is set to meet on July 5, according to the
bank’s  website .  Tanzania’s shilling weakened for a second day, down 0.2
percent to close at 1,575 per dollar, the most since May 24.
 Uganda ’s shilling declined 0.2 percent to close 2,475 per
dollar, the lowest level since June 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
