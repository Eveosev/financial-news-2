South Africa ’s purchasing managers’
 index  fell below 50 for the first time in six months in June,
indicating a contraction in manufacturing and undermining the
outlook in  Africa ’s largest economy, Kagiso Tiso Holdings said.  The seasonally adjusted index fell to a 10-month low of
48.2 from 53.6 in May, Johannesburg-based  Kagiso  said in an e-
mailed statement today.  “In addition to weaker external demand, the latest figures
indicate a sustained and worsening slowdown in domestic
demand,” Abdul Davids, head of research at Kagiso Asset
Management, said in the statement.  Factory output , which makes up 15 percent of the economy,
has come under pressures as the debt crisis in  Europe  cuts
demand from a region that buys about a third of South Africa’s
manufactured goods. Production rose 1.2 percent in April after
contracting 2.9 percent in the previous month, the statistics
office said on June 7.  The new sales orders index, which has the largest weighting
in the PMI, fell 5.2 points to 46.5 in June, while the business
activity sub-index declined more than any other, slipping 9
points to 47, Kagiso said. The employment sub-index dropped to
46.8 from 53, indicating manufacturers fired workers last month.  The Bureau for  Economic Research , based at the University
of Stellenbosch near  Cape Town , and the Institute of Purchasing
and Supply South Africa conduct the PMI survey on behalf of
Kagiso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
