Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields the most in three weeks, after European Union leaders
took steps last week to resolve the euro zone’s debt crisis,
boosting demand for emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond
due in August 2020 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 4.98 percent at 12:19 p.m. in  Lima , according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. It was the biggest drop since June
7. The price increased 0.33 centimo to 118.76 centimos per sol.  Markets in Peru were closed for a holiday on June 29, when
South American assets rallied after European leaders agreed to
ease repayment rules for Spanish banks and relax conditions on
help for  Italy . The outcome exceeded investors’ expectations,
said Kenneth Lam, a strategist at Citigroup Inc.  “Peru didn’t join the party because it was a holiday so
it’s catching up,” Lam said by phone from  New York . “With the
currency rallying, it should generate some appetite for the
bonds too.”  The sol gained 0.5 percent to 2.6510 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
