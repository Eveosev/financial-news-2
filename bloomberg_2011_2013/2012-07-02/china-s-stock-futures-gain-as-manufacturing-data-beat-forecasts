Most  Chinese stocks  rose after the
nation’s  home prices  advanced for the first time in 10 months
and manufacturing indicators beat forecasts.  Poly Real Estate Group Co., the nation’s second-biggest
property developer, surged 2.3 percent as data showed home
prices across 100 cities increased in June. Aluminum Corp. of
 China  Ltd. paced an advance for material stocks as speculation
 Europe ’s debt crisis is easing bolstered the outlook for
commodities demand. SAIC Motor Corp., the biggest Chinese
automaker, slid 8.5 percent after the Guangzhou Daily reported
that Guangzhou city will cap the number of new car purchases.  Six stocks gained for every two that declined on the
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which rose less than 0.1 percent to
2,226.11 at the close. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  added 0.2 percent to
2,465.24. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the
most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, jumped 2.9 percent in
 New York  on June 29.  China’s manufacturing “data was better than expected and
there seemed to be some resolution in Europe,” said Mao Sheng,
an analyst for Huaxi Securities Co. in Chengdu. “Still,
investors are quite concerned about the economy.”  The Shanghai index plunged 6.2 percent in June, the most in
 Asia , on concern the government isn’t loosening monetary policy
quick enough to stem a slowdown even as the central bank cut
 interest rates  for the first time since 2008. Stocks in the
measure are valued at 9.73 times estimated earnings, compared
with the average of 17.6 since Bloomberg began compiling the
 data  in 2006.  Manufacturing Outlook  China’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index fell to 50.2 in June
from 50.4 in May, the Beijing-based National Bureau of
Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing
reported yesterday. That compares with the 49.9 median estimate
in survey of 24 economists. A final PMI reading for June by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today was better than a
preliminary level published last month.  The manufacturing data should provide relief to investors
concerned about a “freefall” in the economy, according to
Barclays Plc. The government’s efforts to stabilize growth are
starting to take effect and growth will bottom in the second
quarter and start improving from June,  Jian Chang , Yiping Huang
and Lingxiu Yang, analysts at Barclays, said in a report.  Aluminum Corp. of China, the largest aluminum producer,
climbed 0.7 percent to 6.21  yuan .  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel
Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co., China’s biggest producer of rare earth,
jumped for a second day, rising 3.7 percent to 40.90 yuan.  Home Prices Rebound  China’s new home prices rose for the first time in 10
months as the government eased its monetary policies to bolster
the economy, according to SouFun Holdings Ltd., the nation’s
biggest real estate website owner.  Home prices increased 0.1 percent from May to 8,688 yuan
($1,367) per square meter, SouFun said in an e-mailed statement
today, based on its survey of 100 cities. Beijing led gains
among the nation’s 10 biggest cities, climbing 2.3 percent from
May, followed by Shenzhen, which added 0.8 percent.  Poly Real Estate (SHPROP)  rose 2.3 percent to 11.60 yuan. China
Vanke Co., the largest property developer, increased 0.8 percent
to 8.98 yuan.  Gemdale Corp. (600383)  climbed 2.6 percent to 6.65 yuan.  SAIC  retreated  8.5 percent to 13.08 yuan, the biggest drop
since Nov. 12, 2010. Great Wall Motor Co. lost 7.4 percent to
16.48 yuan. Guangzhou plans to limit the number of new passenger
vehicles to ease congestion, the Guangzhou Daily reported. The
one-year trial, which takes effect today, will cap the number of
new cars at 120,000, the paper said, citing a government notice.  European Outlook  Chinese stocks traded in the U.S. posted the biggest
monthly gain since February as European leaders agreed to ease
the region’s debt crisis.  Leaders of the European Union, where China sends about 20
percent of its overseas sales, dropped requirements that
taxpayers get preferred creditor status on aid to  Spain ’s banks
and opened the way to recapitalize lenders directly.  “Expectations were low before the leaders’ meeting and any
type of deal that was negotiated would have been a positive
surprise,”  Timothy Ghriskey , chief investment officer at New
York-based Solaris Group, which manages about $2 billion in
assets, said in a phone interview on June 29.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., soared 3.6 percent on June 29,
taking its advance last month to 0.5 percent.  -- Editors: Allen Wan, Darren Boey  To contact the reporter on this story:
