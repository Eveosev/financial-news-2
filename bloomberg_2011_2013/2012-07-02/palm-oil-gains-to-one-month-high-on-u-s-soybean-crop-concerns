Palm oil  climbed to a one-month high
on concern that hot, dry weather in the U.S. may curb soybean
yields, reducing global cooking-oil supplies.  The September-delivery contract advanced as much as 1.7
percent to 3,070 ringgit ($970) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the highest price for the most-active
contract since June 1, and was at 3,065 ringgit at 4:01 p.m. in
 Kuala Lumpur . Futures climbed 2.3 percent last week, trimming
the quarterly decline to 12 percent, the biggest loss since the
three months ended March 2011.  Soybeans have gained 19 percent this year as the drought
sapped soil moisture in the Midwest, the largest U.S. growing
region, after similar weather conditions cut harvests in Brazil
and  Argentina . Farmers may sow 76.08 million acres, up from
74.976 million last year and more than the 73.902 million they
had intended to plant in March, as rising prices and dry weather
led to more of the oilseed getting planted on winter-wheat
fields, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said June 29.  “The higher planting acreage may not lead to a bigger
harvest as the current dryness and heat in the key U.S. planting
regions for corn and soybeans are threatening to reduce
yields,” Ivy Ng, an analyst with CIMB Group Holdings Bhd.,
wrote in a report today. “The U.S. soybean crop rating is at
its lowest level in many years and a smaller soybean harvest
would help crude palm oil price prospects.”  Crop Ratings  Approximately 53 percent of soybeans earned top ratings as
of June 24, down from 56 percent last week and 65 percent a year
earlier, the USDA said June 25. Goldman Sachs raised its three-
month to 12-month price forecast for soybeans to $15.50 per
bushel from $14.30, the bank said in a report dated June 29.  Soybeans for November delivery gained 0.9 percent to $14.40
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. December-delivery
 soybean oil  rose 0.2 percent to 53.21 cents per pound. Palm oil
and soybean oil are used in foods and fuels.  Malaysia’s palm oil exports rose 4.9 percent to 1.45
million tons in June from a month earlier, surveyor Intertek
said on June 30.  Palm oil for January delivery rose 0.4 percent to close at
8,096  yuan  ($1,275) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month climbed 0.9 percent
to end at 9,632 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
