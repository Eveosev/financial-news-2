Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) 
fell, snapping a three-day winning streak, as the yen
strengthened in the last hour of trading and exporters including
Nissan Motor Co. reversed gains. Shares rose earlier after a
 Bank of Japan  manufacturing survey beat estimates.  Nissan lost 0.7 percent after rising as much as 2.3 percent
as Japan’s currency gained against 15 of its 16 major peers.
 Yamada Denki (9831)  Co. sank 4.6 percent after JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut
the electronics retailer’s target price. Nippon Yusen K.K.
jumped 2.4 percent on a plan to double sales at the shipping
line’s logistics operations.  The Nikkei 225 fell less than 0.1 percent to 9,003.48 at
the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo  after rising as much as 1.1 percent,
with volume almost 20 percent below the 30-day average. The
broader  Topix Index (TPX)  dropped 0.1 percent to 769.34. Both indexes
rose 1.5 percent on the previous trading day after European
leaders struck agreements on the debt crisis.  “The EU summit yielded a policy on  Spain , but investors
are concerned that a lot of the details still aren’t decided,”
said Takashi Miyazaki, a senior strategist who helps oversee
about $70 billion at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co. in
Tokyo. “ Europe ’s problems aren’t front-and-center for the
moment, but markets are going to continue to be jittery unless
the  U.S. economy  shows signs of improvement. Investors are
feeling less risk averse, but it’s still difficult to see a
bullish scenario.”  Topix Rebound  The Topix has rebounded more than 10 percent since June 4,
when the index fell to its lowest level since 1983. Stocks rose
after Greek voters elected pro-bailout parties and European
leaders agreed to ease repayment rules for Spanish banks and
make it easier to recapitalize the region’s troubled lenders.  Shares on Japan’s broadest equities gauge traded at an
average of 1.1 times book value, compared with 2.2 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.4 times for the Europe Stoxx
600 Index. A number less than one means that companies can be
bought for less than value of their assets.  Nissan (7201)  and other exporters gave up early gains after the
yen jumped against the dollar and the euro. Japan’s second-
largest carmaker by sales finished the day down 0.7 percent at
743 yen. Sony Corp., Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics, fell 0.5 percent to 1,117 yen.  The yen surged as much as 0.3 percent in the final 60
minutes of trading to as high as 79.50 per dollar. Against the
euro, the currency strengthened to 100.34 from 100.69. A
stronger yen cuts the value of overseas sales when repatriated.  Yamada Denki  Yamada Denki sank 4.6 percent to 3,870 yen after JPMorgan
Chase & Co. cut the retailer’s target price to 4,800 yen from
5,600 yen. The company’s investment rating was cut to neutral
from buy at JI  Asia , the Asian equity research and sales arm of
Japaninvest Group Plc.  Shares rose earlier after the central bank’s quarterly
Tankan index of sentiment among large manufacturers rose to
minus 1 in June from minus 4 in March. The median estimate of 19
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a reading of minus
4. A negative number means pessimists outnumber optimists.  Among companies that gained,  Nippon Yusen  rose 2.4 percent
to 214 yen after President Yasumi Kudo said freight-forwarding
and warehousing businesses led by unit Yusen Logistics Co. will
boost sales to 800 billion yen ($10 billion) within seven years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
