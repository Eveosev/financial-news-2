Jeneba Tarmoh backed out of tonight’s
100-meter run-off against Allyson Felix for the final spot on
the U.S. Olympic track and field team, USA Track & Field said.  The unprecedented head-to-head race in Eugene,  Oregon , was
scheduled to be held nine days after the two training partners
tied for third place in the women’s event at the U.S. Olympic
trials.  Felix and Tarmoh each finished the June 23 100-meter final
with a time of 11.068 seconds, initially leaving  USA Track and
Field  without a rule to determine the third Olympic qualifier.
The race was won by Carmelita Jeter in 10.92 seconds, followed
by Tianna Madison in 10.96. Felix will now be the third member
of the 100-meter squad, with Tarmoh an alternate, and both
already had qualified for the 400-meter relay.  “We are disappointed that Jeneba has changed her mind
regarding her position on the Olympic Team,” USA Track & Field
President Stephanie Hightower said in a statement. “We all
worked hard to reach a consensus on the tiebreaker, but we know
that Allyson, Carmelita and Tianna will represent Team USA
well.”  Tarmoh, 22, at first was announced as the third-place
finisher, giving her what she thought was an Olympic berth after
beating Felix by 0.0001. After officials reviewed video, they
announced the finish as a dead heat.  The following day, procedures were announced that provided
for a run-off or a coin toss if one of the runners didn’t agree
to resign her position.  The decision to conduct a run-off didn’t come until after
both women competed two days ago in the 200 meters, a race won
by Felix in 21.69 seconds to break the 24-year-old meet record
of Florence Griffith-Joyner. Tarmoh was fifth.  Felix and Tarmoh said they never gave serious consideration
to letting the final 100-meter spot be decided on a coin flip.  Felix, 26, is ranked ninth in the world in the 100, while
Tarmoh is 66th, according to All-Athletics.com.  To contact the reporter on this story:
