The  International Monetary Fund  said
 Austria  should consider the overbanked nature of its market when
exiting nationalized banks.  “The exit strategy from the government ownership following
balance sheet clean-up should take into account the need to
reduce overbanking in the Austrian market,” the IMF said in an
Article IV Consultation statement distributed in Vienna today.  Austria has more banks, bank branches and bank employees
per capita than most euro-area countries, leading to more
competition, higher costs and lower margins in the domestic
business, according to the central bank. The last major merger
between two Austrian banks was Bawag’s purchase of PSK in 2005.
Most of its big banks have started operations in eastern  Europe 
to add to their modest profits at home.  The Alpine republic’s government acquired a stake in
 Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS)  earlier this year when it had to
bail out the cooperative lender and may convert that into
majority control. It also owns municipal lender Kommunalkredit
Austria AG, its “bad bank” KA Finanz AG and Hypo Alpe-Adria-
Bank International AG, which is mainly active in southern
Austria, the former Yugoslavia and  Italy .  “The recent experience with medium-sized banks has shown
the cost of delaying the disposal of legacy and non-core
assets,” the IMF said in the statement. “Regarding troubled
banks with significant government ownership, we encourage the
authorities to develop a strategy for a more efficient disposal
of these assets with the goal of minimizing final fiscal
costs.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
