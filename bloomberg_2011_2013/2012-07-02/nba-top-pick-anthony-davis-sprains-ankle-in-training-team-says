Anthony Davis , the top pick in the
National Basketball Association draft, sprained his ankle during
a workout with the New Orleans Hornets.  Davis injured the ankle during a practice two days ago and
his availability to practice with the U.S. Olympic team will be
evaluated later this week, the Hornets said in a news release.  The 19-year-old Davis was a finalist for the Olympic roster
after the U.S. team lost players including NBA All-Stars Dwyane Wade, Derrick Rose and Chris Bosh to injuries.  The former University of Kentucky player was selected first
by the Hornets in the NBA draft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
