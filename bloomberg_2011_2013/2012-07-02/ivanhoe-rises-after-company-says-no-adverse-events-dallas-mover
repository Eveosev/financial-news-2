Ivanhoe Energy Inc. (IVAN) , the Calgary-
based oil producer with operations in China and Ecuador, rose
the most since 2006 after the company said there have been no
developments that would explain a 27 percent plunge in the
shares on June 29.  Ivanhoe rose 47 percent to 72 cents at the close in  New
York , the most since January 2006.  On June 29, the shares came under the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission’s “alternative uptick rule,” which is
intended to restrict short-selling, when the price fell to 49
cents.  There “have been no material adverse developments or
circumstances with respect to the company’s activities that
would explain this sudden drop,” Ivanhoe said in a statement
today.  Ivanhoe’s management hasn’t sold any shares and “remains
confident in our ability to grow this company,” Executive
Chairman Carlos A. Cabrera said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
