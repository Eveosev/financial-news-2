Marcus Jordan, a son of basketball
Hall of Fame player and  Charlotte  Bobcats owner  Michael Jordan ,
was arrested after an argument outside a hotel in Omaha,
Nebraska, police said.  Jordan, 21, was charged with resisting arrest, disorderly
conduct and obstructing, according to a statement released by
the Omaha Police Department.  Police were dispatched to an Embassy Suites hotel around 2
a.m. yesterday and found Jordan arguing with two women in the
driveway, according to the statement.  “The subject was very animated, intoxicated and
uncooperative,” the police said in the statement. After a brief
struggle, it took multiple officers to control and handcuff the
suspect, police said.  Jordan, who plays basketball at the University of Central
Florida, was booked at the Douglas County Department of
Corrections and later released. Police said they didn’t know if
was represented by an attorney.  Michael Jordan, a five-time National Basketball Association
Most Valuable Player, had no comment on the arrest, spokeswoman
Estee Portnoy said in an e-mail.  The 6-foot-3, 205-pound Jordan averaged 13.7 points last
season as a junior at  Central Florida .  “After gathering all of the facts, we will deal with this
situation in an appropriate manner,” the school’s athletic
department said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
