Silver prices, which slumped for four
straight months, may rebound 25 percent after hitting a “double
bottom,” according to  technical analysis  by Steel Vine
Investments LLC.  Silver futures for September delivery may climb to $34.50
an ounce this quarter after falling to $26.33 on Sept. 26 and
$26.105 on June 28, this year’s low, said Spencer Patton, the
Chicago-based chief investment officer for Steel Vine. Prices
jumped 5 percent on June 29, the most since Jan. 3.  A double bottom is a chart pattern showing a drop in price,
followed by a rebound and then another decline to near the same
level, usually indicating support.  “We have jumped back from the inflection point telling us
that prices are now headed higher,” Patton said. The first
“psychological” level the market will test is $30, he said.  Yesterday, silver futures for September delivery declined
0.4 percent to settle at $27.499 on the Comex in  New York . The
contract slumped 21 percent in the four months through June.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
