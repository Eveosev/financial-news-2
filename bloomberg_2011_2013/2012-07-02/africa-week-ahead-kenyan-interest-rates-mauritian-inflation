The Central Bank of  Kenya  meets on
July 5 to announce its latest monetary policy stance. The
central bank left its  benchmark interest rate  unchanged at a
record 18 percent at its last meeting on June 5 to help support
the shilling and curb inflation.  The Ugandan central bank meets on July 3 to set its
monetary policy. The bank on June 1 cut its key lending rate by
1 percentage point, the third reduction this year, to 20 percent
as inflation slowed.  Statistics Mauritius announces inflation data for June on
July 6. The rate was steady at a 19-month low of 3.8 percent in
May and inflation risks are on the downside amid reduced global
demand, the Bank of Mauritius said on June 11 when its benchmark
repo rate was left unchanged at 4.9 percent.
