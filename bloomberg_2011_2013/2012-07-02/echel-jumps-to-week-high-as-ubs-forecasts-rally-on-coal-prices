OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  climbed to the strongest
level in more than a week after  UBS AG (UBSN)  removed  Russia ’s biggest
producer of coking-coal from its least-preferred stocks list,
citing potential for a rally should prices increase.  Mechel added 0.4 percent to 206.30 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the highest since June 21. Mechel has slumped 24 percent
this year.  “Any positive coal price movement could trigger a stock
rally,” UBS analysts led by Kirill Chuyko, said in an e-mailed
research note.  To contact the reporters on this story:
