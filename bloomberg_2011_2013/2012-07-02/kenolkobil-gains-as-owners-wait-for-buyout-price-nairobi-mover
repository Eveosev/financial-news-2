KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC) , a Kenyan fuel
retailer, rallied as investors wait for Puma Energy BV to
announce the price at which it will buy out minority
shareholders.  The stock jumped 8 percent to 15.45 shillings by the close
in Nairobi, the biggest one-day gain since June 25, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Most of the trading is being driven by speculation
because the company is expected to issue a price in July,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment
Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today. “The speculation is
that minority shareholders will get quite an attractive price.”  The company said on June 28 that Puma Energy is continuing
due diligence on a proposed takeover and it’s “cautiously
optimistic” a deal will take place. KenolKobil said on May 8
its main shareholders agreed to sell their majority stake to
Puma, a Geneva-based subsidiary of Trafigura Beheer BV. Puma
will offer to buy 100 percent of KenolKobil after due diligence
is completed, the Kenyan company said on May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
