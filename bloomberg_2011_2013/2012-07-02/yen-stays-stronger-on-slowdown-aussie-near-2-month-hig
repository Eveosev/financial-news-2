The dollar declined against most of
its major peers on speculation  Federal Reserve  may introduce
another round of bond purchases, known as quantitative easing,
to stimulate faltering growth.  The greenback slid against the euro before U.S. data today
forecast to show factory orders stagnated after the  Institute
for Supply Management ’s gauge of manufacturing unexpectedly fell
yesterday. Demand for the yen was hampered as Asian stocks rose
for a fifth day, sapping demand for haven assets. Australia’s
dollar traded within 0.1 percent of a two-month high after data
showed building approvals surged by a record in May.  “The  U.S. economy  has been losing steam to date,” said
 Mike Jones , a Wellington-based currency strategist at Bank of
New Zealand Ltd. “Signs of more aggressive slowdown are
negative for the U.S dollar insofar as they elicit another round
of quantitative easing from the Fed.”  The dollar slid 0.1 percent to $1.2582 per euro as of 10:35
a.m. in Tokyo yesterday when it advanced 0.7 percent. The
greenback was at 79.59 yen from 79.51 yesterday. The Japanese
currency fetched 100.14 per euro from 100 yesterday, when it
jumped 1 percent. The  Australian dollar  gained 0.2 percent
$1.0268 from yesterday, when it touched $1.0278, the highest
since May 4.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks advanced 0.6 percent,
extending last week’s 2.7 percent gain.  U.S. factory orders probably rose 0.1 percent in May after
a 0.6 percent drop the previous month, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the
Commerce Department releases its data today.  ISM Report  The ISM’s  index  fell to 49.7, worse than the most-
pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg poll, from 53.5 in May, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group’s report showed yesterday. Figures
less than 50 signal contraction. Measures of orders, production
and export demand dropped to three-year lows.  “This is not an economy in galloping growth that’s
creating 300,000 or 400,000 net new jobs a month,”  Kenneth Rogoff , an economics professor at  Harvard University , said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television. “Right now the U.S.,
although not falling into an immediate recession, is not an
engine of growth that’s going to pull us out with China slowing
and Europe in recession.”  The number of permits granted to build or renovate houses
and apartments in Australia jumped a record 27.3 percent from
April, when they declined a revised 7.6 percent, the Bureau of
Statistics said in Sydney. The median estimate of economists in
a Bloomberg survey was a 5 percent gain.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia will keep its cash-rate
target at 3.5 percent at a policy meeting today, according to
all 28 economists in a Bloomberg poll.  To contact the reporters on this story:
