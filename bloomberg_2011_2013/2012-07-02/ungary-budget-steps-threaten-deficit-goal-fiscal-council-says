Hungary’s proposed amendments to the
2012 budget “significantly raise” the risk of the government
overshooting its budget-deficit target, the Fiscal Council said.  The changes widen the 2012  shortfall  as calculated under
European Union methodology, the Council in charge of overseeing
budget planning an execution said in an  opinion  posted on
parliament’s website.  Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  proposed raising revenue
and spending this year by 145 billion forint ($641 million)
each, keeping the deficit unchanged at 2.5 percent of gross
domestic product, according to a  draft  posted on Parliament’s
website. The government raised this year’s sales-tax income
projection and target for revenue from state assets to cover
higher spending including on EU development and the buyout of
public-private partnership projects.  Hungary pledged to keep its shortfall below the EU limit of
3 percent of GDP this year to end an excessive-deficit procedure
it has been under since joining the block in 2004. The Cabinet
is seeking to revive bailout negotiations with the  International
Monetary Fund  and the EU, frozen for seven months, as the
economy is forecast to slip into  recession .  The changes would “somewhat” boost Hungary’s debt level,
which the government may mitigate by using forint and foreign-
currency deposits, the Council said. Public debt fell to 79
percent of gross domestic product in the first quarter from 80.8
percent in the final three months of 2011, the central bank said
on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
