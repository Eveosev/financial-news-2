The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars declined to the lowest in more than a week, according
to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 53.5
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:30 a.m.
in  London  from minus 56 basis points on June 29. The measure
reached minus 59 on June 4, the most expensive in three months.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 51 basis
points below Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
Euribor is the rate  banks  say they see each other lending in
euros and is derived from a survey by the European Banking
Federation.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to a gauge of overnight borrowing costs or overnight
indexed swaps -- known as the  FRA/OIS spread  -- were at 26 basis
points from 27. A decrease signals banks are more willing to
lend. The Euribor/Eonia OIS spread was 41.5 basis points from
42.  The Eonia OIS swap, an estimate of average overnight
borrowing costs over the next three months, was at 24 basis
points from 23 on June 29. The measure held below the  European
Central Bank ’s deposit rate of 25 basis points for the 11th day.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based ECB
on June 29, placing 773 billion euros ($977 billion) from 782
billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
