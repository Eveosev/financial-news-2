What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures may open 5 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade after the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said that hot weather cut crop conditions for a
fourth straight week,  Dave Marshall , a farm marketing adviser
for Toay Commodity Futures Group LLC, said by telephone from
Nashville,  Illinois . About 48 percent of U.S. corn was rated
good or excellent, down from 56 percent a week earlier,
government data showed after the close of trading today.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago as 45 percent of the crop earned the governmentâ€™s top
ratings, down from 53 percent the prior week, Marshall said.
Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent
higher per pound, and soybean-meal futures may open $2 to $4
higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  after the USDA lowered the ratings for the spring
crop, grown in the U.S. northern Plains, to 71 percent good or
excellent from 77 percent a week earlier, Marshall said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
