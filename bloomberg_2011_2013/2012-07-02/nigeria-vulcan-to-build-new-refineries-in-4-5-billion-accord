Nigeria  signed a memorandum of
understanding with a U.S.-Nigerian joint venture to build six
modular refineries with a combined capacity of 180,000 barrels a
day, the country’s Trade and Investment Ministry said.  The joint venture group, comprising Vulcan Energy Corp. and
Petroleum Refining and Strategic Reserve Ltd., signed a $4.5
billion deal to build the refineries in collaboration with
state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., or NNPC, Trade
and Investment Minister Olusegun Aganga said today in an e-
mailed statement from Abuja, the capital. Two of the refineries
are expected to be completed within a year.  “We are working in collaboration with the Ministry of
Petroleum Resources and the NNPC; we are working together as a
team to ensure that in 12 months’ time, we witness the
commissioning of the refineries,” Aganga said.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, plans to boost
foreign investment in industries by making it easier to do
business in the country. The government is focusing on changes
that can improve the investment climate and on the overhaul of
industries.  The continent’s most populous nation, with more than 160
million inhabitants, relies on foreign fuel supplies for 70
percent of its requirements because of inadequate refining
capacity, Petroleum Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke said in
November. It exchanges 60,000 barrels a day of crude for
products with Trafigura Beheer BV and a similar amount with
Societe Ivoirienne de Raffinage’s refinery in  Ivory Coast ,
according to NNPC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
