Mark Cavendish  won stage two of the
 Tour de France , beating Andre Greipel by a wheel length in a
sprint finish.  Cavendish, a Briton with Team Sky, took his 21st Tour stage
win at the end of a flat 129-mile ride in Belgium between Vise
and Tournai.  Fabian Cancellara, a Swiss rider with the RadioShack-
Nissan-Trek team, retained a seven-second lead over Bradley Wiggins and Sylvain Chavanel.  Wiggins, a teammate of Cavendish who’s seeking to become
the Tour’s first British winner, and defending champion  Cadel
Evans  of Australia are the bookmakers’ favorites to win the 99th
edition of the race.  Evans remains 10 seconds behind Wiggins.  Anthony Roux, a French rider with FDJ-Big Mat, made a
breakaway from the main pack of riders after 14 miles and was
joined by Team Saxo Bank’s Michael Morkov and Europcar’s
Christophe Kern.  Morkov and Kern were caught by the peloton with about 18
miles left. Roux went it alone for nine more miles, balancing
his forearms on the handlebars after hurting his left wrist in a
fall yesterday.  The  20-stage race  crosses into France tomorrow with a hilly
stage between Orchies and Boulogne-sur-Mer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
