Libya  will release four staff members
working for the Hague-based  International Criminal Court  and
allow them to return to their countries, the Libya News Agency
reported, citing a military commander in the city of Zintan.  The four, who include Melinda Taylor, an Australian defense
attorney, were arrested last month after Libyan authorities said
Taylor tried to pass on documents to Muammar Qaddafi’s son and
one-time heir-apparent, Saif al-Islam Qaddafi.  Al-Ajmi al-Esary, the head of the military unit that had
arrested the four in Zintan, said they would be released later
in the day during a press conference that will also include the
court’s head, Judge Sang Hyun Song. He said the investigation
will nonetheless continue.  The ICC has criticized their detention, saying they had
immunity while on assignment for the court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
