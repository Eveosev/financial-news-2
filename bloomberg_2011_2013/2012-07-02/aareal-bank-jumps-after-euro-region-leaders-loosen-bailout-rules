Aareal Bank AG (ARL) , a German commercial
property lender, jumped to the highest in seven weeks after
European Union leaders agreed to ease repayment rules for
Spanish banks and relaxed conditions for possible aid to  Italy .  Aareal rose 7 percent to 13.84 euros at the close in
 Frankfurt , the highest since May 11. It has gained 15 percent
since June 28, after euro-area leaders dropped the requirement
that governments get preferred-creditor status on crisis loans
to Spain’s banks and opened the door to recapitalizing lenders
directly with bailout funds once a banking supervisor is set up.  The lender’s shares tumbled 39 percent from their high on
Feb. 3 through June 28 because of investor concerns that the
sovereign debt crisis would cause losses on Spanish and Italian
 government bonds .  “The bank has relatively high exposure to Italian and
Spanish government debt and the decisions made in Brussels last
week are good news for Aareal,” said Philip Haessler, an
analyst at Equinet AG. “Despite the large exposure to Italian
and Spanish debt the bank has a business model that works.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
