Non-government organizations,
including Greenpeace, will sue the Romanian government over
agreements enabling  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  to explore for shale gas
deposits in the country, Bursa newspaper  reported , citing lawyer
Gheorghe Piperea.  The government said it wonâ€™t cancel the agreements with
Chevron, which it deemed legal, after Greenpeace and four other
non-government organizations filed a complaint in May and asked
the Cabinet to cancel the four accords, Bursa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
