Sanko Steamship Co., the Japanese
operator of 185 ships, asked a court to protect its U.S. assets
after the company filed for  bankruptcy protection  in Japan.  Sanko listed assets and debt of more than $500 million in a
Chapter 15 petition filed in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.
Companies use Chapter 15 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code  to protect
their U.S. assets while they reorganize operations under the
jurisdiction of a foreign bankruptcy court.  Sanko said yesterday that the Tokyo District Court granted
the closely held company permission to keep operating. A trustee
will be appointed to oversee a reorganization, the Tokyo-based
company said in an e-mail statement.  “The Japanese proceeding is intended to provide Sanko with
the protection needed to reorganize its financial affairs and
maximize recoveries for all stakeholders,” the company said in
court papers, referring to the main bankruptcy case in Tokyo.  The ship operator failed to act quickly enough to cut
expensive charters as the economy faltered and  shipping rates 
fell, it said.  Sanko also asked the U.S.  Bankruptcy Court  to recognize the
case in Tokyo as the one to be used to help the company
reorganize.  Sanko, which was founded in 1934, had 185 ships as of April
1, including dry-bulk carriers, tankers and offshore vessels,
according to its  website . It canceled an order for a gas tanker
earlier this year that was to be built by Sasebo Heavy
Industries Co.  The U.S. case is In re: The Sanko Steamship Co. Ltd. 12-
12815, U.S. Bankruptcy Court District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
