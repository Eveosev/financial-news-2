The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 0.5 percent to 596.5 at 4:21 p.m.  Singapore 
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials rose 4.12
percent to 1486.717 as of June 29.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell in  New York  as investors sold contracts to profit
from the biggest price surge in three years before reports today
that may signal Europe’s economic slump is deepening.  Crude for August delivery dropped as much as $1.34 to
$83.62 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. It was at $83.76 at 2:51 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract gained $7.27 on June 29 to $84.96, the highest close
since June 6. Prices decreased 18 percent last quarter, the most
since the final three months of 2008.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures slid in New York after closing last
week at the highest level since January.  Futures for August delivery dipped as much as 3.4 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $2.790 per million British thermal units on the
 New York Mercantile exchange  and were at $2.802 at 12:30 p.m.
Tokyo time.  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil to Dubai crude fell $2.67, or 16
percent, to $14.21 a barrel, the lowest since Dec. 31, 2010,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.  Singapore gasoil swaps for August rose 57 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $108.57 a barrel at 10:10 a.m. Singapore time.  Jet fuel traded at a premium of 80 cents a barrel to
gasoil, up 5 cents from June 29. This spread, also known as the
regrade, has decreased 20 percent from a week earlier, signaling
it is less profitable to make  aviation fuel .  Oil in New York fell today as investors sold contracts to
profit from the biggest price surge in three years. Futures
declined as much as 1.5 percent after surging 9.4 percent on
June 29.  Singapore  fuel oil ’s discount to Dubai crude was at $3.77 a
metric ton, widening by $3.75 from June 29, PVM data showed. The
discount is the biggest since May 16, signaling growing losses
from making the fuel.  High-sulfur fuel-oil swaps for August fell $3.25, or 0.6
percent, to $575.25 a ton. The premium of 180-centistoke fuel
oil to the 380-centistoke grade widened 25 cents to $10.75 a
ton, meaning bunker fuel prices fell faster than power-station
fuel oil today.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold fell, trading below $1,600 an ounce, as some investors
sold the metal after its biggest gain in a month and as the
dollar’s rebound against the euro trimmed demand for alternative
investments. Silver and platinum dropped.  Spot gold lost as much as 0.5 percent to $1,589.22 an ounce
and was at $1,592.60 at 2:02 p.m. in Singapore, after climbing
2.9 percent on June 29. Commodities rallied that day after
policy makers in  Europe  eased repayment rules for Spanish banks,
relaxed conditions for possible aid to  Italy  and unveiled a 120
billion-euro ($152 billion) growth plan for the region.  August-delivery bullion fell as much as 0.9 percent to
$1,589.30 an ounce on the Comex in New York, and was last at
$1,592.70. Spot silver slid as much as 1 percent to $27.215 an
ounce, before trading at $27.3075. The metal surged 4.2 percent
on June 29, the most in four months.  BASE METALS  Copper declined as some investors weighed the effect of the
European agreement to help contain the region’s debt crisis and
as inventories in London expanded.  Copper for delivery in three months fell 0.5 percent to
$7,647.75 a ton on the  London  Metal Exchange at 4:44 p.m. in
 Seoul  after climbing 4.1 percent on June 29, the biggest gain in
seven months. Futures for September delivery lost 0.8 percent to
$3.47 a pound on the Comex in New York.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn for delivery after the next U.S. harvest rallied to
the highest level in more than nine months on concern that a
heat wave may hurt yields, cutting stockpiles in the world’s
biggest exporter. Soybeans and wheat advanced.  Corn for December surged as much as 4.6 percent to $6.64 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest price for that
contract since Sept. 12. Futures were at $6.4975 at 2:28 p.m. in
Singapore. The price for the most-active contract jumped 15
percent last week, the most since December 2008.  Soybeans for November delivery rose as much as 2 percent to
$14.5575 a bushel, the highest price since that contract first
traded in June 2009, and the most expensive for the most-active
contract since May 11. The oilseed, which traded at $14.39, has
gained 19 percent this year as the drought sapped soil moisture
in the Midwest, the largest U.S. growing region, after similar
weather cut harvests in Brazil and  Argentina .  September-delivery wheat climbed as much as 2.3 percent to
$7.7475 a bushel, the highest price for the most-active contract
since Sept. 2, and was at $7.64.  Rubber surged the most in seven months after European
leaders agreed on measures to ease the region’s debt crisis,
boosting speculation that demand will recover for the commodity
used in tires.  The December-delivery contract climbed as much as 5
percent, the biggest gain for the most-active contract since
Dec. 1, to 252.2 yen a kilogram ($3,167 a metric ton), before
settling at 246.2 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. That
pared this year’s losses to 6.5 percent this year.  Palm oil  climbed to a one-month high on concern that hot,
dry weather in the U.S. may curb soybean yields, reducing global
cooking-oil supplies.  The September-delivery contract advanced as much as 1.5
percent to 3,066 ringgit ($968) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the highest price for the most-active
contract since June 1, and was at 3,063 ringgit at 12:12 p.m. in
 Kuala Lumpur . Futures climbed 2.3 percent last week, trimming
the quarterly decline to 12 percent, the biggest loss since the
three months ended March 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
