Vietnam ’s five-year bonds dropped,
pushing the yield up by the most in a week, on speculation banks
will reduce investments in the notes as they set aside cash for
lending. The dong strengthened.  Lenders may keep funds in reserve to meet any pickup in
credit demand after the central bank lowered  interest rates  on
June 29 for a fifth time this year to spur economic growth,
according to ACB Securities Co. The government is seeking to
boost the pace of expansion in 2012 to 6 percent, compared with
4.66 percent in the three months through June. The  overnight
interbank deposit rate  rose 56 basis points, or 0.56 percentage
point, to 4.97 percent today, signaling a decline in funds,
according to data from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  Policy makers “will likely tend to focus on the economic
growth target in the second half of 2012,” Cao Tan Phat, a Ho
Chi Minh City-based analyst at ACB Securities, wrote in a
research note published yesterday. “As a result, with further
monetary easing, depositary institutions are encouraged to
reserve their cash with expectations of increasing credit lines
by the year-end, leading to limited funds for bond buying.”  The  yield  on securities due in 2017 climbed five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 9.78 percent, according to
a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That is
the biggest increase since June 22.  The dong strengthened 0.2 percent to 20,837 per dollar as
of 2:30 p.m. in Hanoi, compared with 20,878 at the end of last
week, according to data from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,828 per dollar,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on either side
of the official rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
