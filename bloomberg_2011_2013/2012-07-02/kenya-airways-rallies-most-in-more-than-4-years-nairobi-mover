Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-biggest airline, rallied the most in more than
three years, climbing for a fifth day after agreeing a financing
deal for the purchase of aircraft.  The stock jumped 9.5 percent to 14.35 shillings by the
close in Nairobi, the biggest gain since March 2009. The five-
day rally is the longest since Nov. 25, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  KQ, as the airline is known, said June 25 it will borrow
$1.9 billion from African Export-Import Bank to fund the
purchase of 20 Boeing Co. and Embraer SA aircraft. The financing
will be split into two components, with $3 million to be used
for pre-delivery payments loaned over a seven-year period and
the remainder to be paid back over 10 years, the company said.  “The loan will only  be disbursed at the point of
procuring the aircraft,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at
Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone
interview today. “A lot of the fears that we had seen on the
part of investors following the under subscription of the rights
issue and industry performance have eased because all the bad
news has been priced in.”  The airline said June 8 it raised 14.5 billion shillings
($172 million) in a sale of stock to existing shareholders. The
carrier, based in Nairobi, received applications for 1.03
billion shares, or 70 percent of the total for sale. It had
sought to raise 20.7 billion shillings to fund a plan to expand
across Africa.  Net income slumped 53 percent to 1.66 billion shillings in
the 12 months through March, the airline said June 14. Profit
was less than the 1.94 billion-shilling average of five analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  KQ shares have fallen 27 percent in 2012, the biggest drop
on the  Nairobi Securities Exchange All Share Index (NSEASI) , which has
climbed 26 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
