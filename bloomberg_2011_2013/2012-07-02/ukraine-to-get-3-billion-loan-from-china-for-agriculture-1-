Ukraine said it will get a $3 billion
loan from  China  for agriculture projects, bolstering cooperation
between the nations after they signed a currency-swap agreement
last week.  The 15-year loan will carry an interest rate of 6 percent,
Ukraineâ€™s central bank, based in the capital, Kiev, said today
in e-mailed statement. There will be a five-year grace period
during which Ukraine will only pay interest, it said.  The two countries, which signed a three-year 15 billion-
 yuan  ($2.4 billion) currency-swap accord on June 26, are still
discussing which agricultural projects will be financed using
the loan, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
