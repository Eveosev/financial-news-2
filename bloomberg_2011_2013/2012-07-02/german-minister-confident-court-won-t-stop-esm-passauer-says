German Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger is confident that the country’s top
court won’t stop the future European permanent bailout fund
after parliament approved the law on June 29, the  Passauer Neue
Presse  said, citing an interview.  While the Federal Constitutional Court has limited
parliament’s room for maneuver on several occasions in the past,
it hasn’t challenged  government aid  to troubled euro member
states in principle, the newspaper cited Leutheusser-
Schnarrenberger as saying.  Lawmakers took past constitutional-court decisions into
account when they drafted the law to establish the European
Stability Mechanism, and the measure was passed with a two-
thirds majority, she told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
