Robert Bosch GmbH Chairman Franz Fehrenbach urged politicians to introduce an  import tariff  on
photovoltaic products in order to prevent “clear” dumping from
unprofitable Chinese manufacturers,  Handelsblatt  reported.  Bosch may consider withdrawing from the solar energy sector
if the business endangers the company, Handelsblatt cited
Fehrenbach as saying in an interview. He became chairman on July
1 having previously been chief executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
