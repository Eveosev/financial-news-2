Altana AG, the 140-year-old maker of
chemical additives owned by billionaire Susanne Klatten,
reshuffled its  supervisory board , with the former chief
executive of Cognis, Antonio Trius, joining as a board member
following its takeover by  BASF SE. (BAS)   Klaus-Jurgen Schmieder, a former  Air Liquide (AI)  SA executive,
will take over as chairman, and ex Chemetall president, Monika Engel-Bader, joins as a supervisory board member, Altana said in
a release today. Retirements opened up the three posts.  “We have again attracted outstanding personalities, both
on a professional and personal level,” Chief Executive Officer
Matthias L. Wolfgruber said in the statement. “In its new
composition, too, the supervisory board will constructively
accompany and support Altana’s growth- and value-oriented
course.”  Altana has made a string of bolt-on acquisitions this year
to grow in fast-growing markets, including  China , where it
recently purchased factories to expand enamels and electrical
insulation divisions. Earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization declined 2 percent to 308 million
euros ($389 million) last year, held back by spiraling raw-
material costs that offset growth in sealants and coatings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
