Mercuria Energy Trading SA bought a
cargo of  North Sea  Forties while Total SA and Morgan Stanley
sought to buy the blend without success. No bids or offers were
shown for Russian Urals crude for a second day.  OAO Surgutneftegas, a Russian oil producer, sold three
Urals cargoes of 100,000 metric tons each via a tender to Royal
Dutch Shell Plc and Statoil ASA for loading from the Baltic Sea
port of Primorsk, according to three traders who participate in
the market.  North Sea  Vitol Group sold one cargo with parcel number F0710 for
July 17 to July 19 loading to Mercuria at 65 cents a barrel less
than the cash cost of North Sea crudes for September, according
to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts trading window.  The shipment was delayed by a day, after having been
deferred by one day last month from the originally planned July
15 to July 17, two people with knowledge of the shipping
schedule said.  Total failed to buy a shipment for Forties for July 22 to
July 29 at 5 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, the highest
bid since June 8, and another for July 15 to July 20 at a
discount of 20 cents to the benchmark, the survey showed.  Morgan Stanley didn’t manage to buy two Forties cargoes.  A
shipment for July 16 to July 22 was bid at 15 cents a barrel
less than Dated Brent and a consignment for July 22 to July 28
at a discount of 10 cents, according to the survey.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 33 cents a barrel less than
Dated Brent, compared with a discount of 34 cents on June 29,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for August settlement traded at $95.91 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, up from $95.30 on June 29. The September contract was at
$95.75, a discount of 16 cents to August.  Statoil shut production from the Gullfaks A oil platform in
the North Sea after ballast water leaked into a utility shaft
yesterday, Ola Anders Skauby, a company spokesman, said in an e-
mail on June 29.  “It is expected that it will take some days to repair the
leak,” he said in the e-mail.  A strike by oil and gas workers in  Norway  entered a second
week, disrupting about 15 percent of crude supply from western
Europe’s largest exporter.  No talks between unions and industry representatives are
scheduled, Jan Hodneland, chief negotiator for the Norwegian Oil
Industry Association, said today by phone from Stavanger. The
action, which is over pensions, may continue for days, he said.  Mediterranean/Urals  Urals was at 72 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent,
compared with a four-month high of a discount of 45 cents a
barrel on June 29, Bloomberg data show.  Shell got one Urals cargo from Surgutneftegas for July 22
to July 23 and one for July 27 to July 28, while Statoil was
awarded a shipment for July 24 to July 25, according to the
people, who declined to be identified because the information is
confidential.  Three cargoes of Urals were dropped from the loading
program for July, according to three people with knowledge of
the loading program.  One shipment of 140,000 tons for July 19 to July 20 loading
from the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk and two 100,000-ton
consignments for July 14 to July 15 and July 23 to July 24 from
Primorsk were canceled, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is confidential. All three
cargoes were owned by TNK-BP.  West Africa  Qua Iboe was unchanged today at a 20-month low of a premium
of $1.30 on June 29, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
