Heritage Oil Plc (HOIL)  bought a stake in
Nigerian  oil fields  from  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Total SA (FP)  for
$850 million to bolster production.  Heritage and Nigerian partner Shoreline Power Co. agreed to
buy 45 percent in OML 30, an onshore license with about 35,000
barrels of oil output a day. Shares of the Jersey, U.K.-based
company are suspended in London because the deal is considered a
reverse takeover. It will be funded with a $370 million rights
offer and  Standard Bank  is providing a $550 million bridge loan.  The deal will quadruple St. Helier, Jersey-based Heritage’s
reserves and lift output to about 11,350 barrels a day from 605
barrels, giving the company more cash from operations. Heritage
has dropped about 73 percent since the start of 2011 after
discovering gas instead of oil at its acreage in Kurdistan,
northern  Iraq .  Heritage  shares  rose 5.3 percent to 123 pence in London,
valuing the company at 317 million pounds ($497 million).  “This is transformational for Heritage,” Chief Financial
Officer Paul Atherton said in a phone interview. “There will be
more opportunities to acquire acreage in Nigeria, and we have a
strategy to be one of the leading institutions in the country.”  The price was “attractive,” Atherton said. Output at the
field should rise to 55,000 barrels a day in the short term and
reach 145,000 barrels in 2018, he said. The Shoreline venture
will generate as much as $200 million a year, Atherton said.  The company isn’t shifting away from other regions and
won’t be the operator in Nigeria. Heritage has exploration
assets in Kurdistan, Malta, Tanzania, Mali, Pakistan and Libya.  “It’s not a case of taking away the focus,” Atherton
said. “It’s a rebalancing of the portfolio. We’ll have a
greater proportion of oil, and the deal will be cash-flow
generative.”  OML 30 includes eight producing fields and a segment of the
Trans-Forcados pipeline, with 850,000 barrel-a-day capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
