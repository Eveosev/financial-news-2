Corn for delivery after the next U.S.
harvest rallied to the highest level in more than nine months on
speculation a heat wave may hurt yields. Soybeans and wheat also
advanced.  The Midwest will be hot and mostly dry in the next five to
seven days, with crops in Missouri, Illinois and Indiana most at
risk of damage after receiving little rain in the past month,
Telvent DTN said today. Temperatures will stay above 90 degrees
Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) for much of the region through
at least July 7. About 71 percent of the U.S.  Midwest  is
experiencing drier-than-normal conditions, according to data
from the University of  Nebraska  at Lincoln.  “Conditions remain exceptionally hot and dry,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia (CBA) , said by phone from Sydney today. “Yield potentials
are declining daily and the inventory projections for 2012-2013
season are being cut quite drastically.”  Corn for December jumped 2.9 percent to $6.5325 a bushel by
1:24 p.m.  London  time on the Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier,
the price touched $6.64, the highest for that contract since
Sept. 12. Futures surged 15 percent last week.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its estimates for corn
prices in three to 12 months to $6.25 a bushel, up from a
previous forecast of $5.25, on the prospect of a smaller-than-
expected U.S. harvest. Yields in the U.S. may average 153.5
bushels per acre, less than the Department of Agriculture’s
projection for a record 166 bushels, the bank said.  On June 29, the USDA raised its estimate of U.S. corn
plantings to a 75-year high of 96.4 million acres, up from a
forecast of 95.864 million in March. The expansion didn’t
“derail the market’s current concerns over yields,” Morgan
Stanley analyst  Hussein Allidina  said in a report.  Soybeans Climb  Soybeans for November delivery rose 1.1 percent to $14.4275
a bushel, after earlier touching $14.5575, the highest since the
contract first traded in June 2009. September-delivery wheat
gained 1.2 percent to $7.6625 a bushel, after earlier climbing
to $7.7475, the highest for the contract since September.  In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat rallied 1.7
percent to 230.50 euros ($290.22) per metric ton on NYSE Liffe.
The grain earlier touched 231.75 euros, the highest ever for the
contract, which began trading in March 2011.  Spring drought and winter frosts may cut Russia’s grain and
legume harvest to 85 million tons, down from an earlier estimate
of 94 million, the  Agriculture Ministry  said June 26. Russia was
the world’s biggest wheat exporter in the 2011-12 season year
after the U.S. and  Australia , according to the USDA.  “Russia’s crop is down reasonably significantly but the
harm to their export potential is quite significant,”  Dave
Norris , an independent grain broker, said today by telephone
from Harrogate,  England .  Paris wheat prices nearly doubled in 2010 after drought
spurred Russia to ban grain exports, leading importers to
increase purchases from suppliers in the European Union and U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
