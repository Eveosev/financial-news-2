Czech manufacturing performance
worsened for a third month in June as the euro area’s sovereign
debt crisis continued to curb export orders, an industry gauge
showed.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI rose to 49.4,
from a 33-month low of 47.6 in May, the bank said today in an e-
mailed report. A result greater than 50 signals improvement in
manufacturing performance, while a figure below signals a
deterioration.  “Linked to the ongoing crisis and uncertainty in western
European markets, new export business in the Czech manufacturing
sector fell for the eighth month running in June,” the bank
said in the report, compiled by Markit, a financial information
services company. “The rate of decline eased, but the current
sequence is the second-longest in the survey history.”  Gross domestic product  fell 0.8 percent in the first
quarter from the final three months of 2011, the second
contraction in as many quarters, as domestic demand dropped amid
government austerity and uncertainty over  Europe ’s economic
future. The economy relies on demand for cars, auto parts and
electronics goods from the European Union, which buys about 80
percent of Czech exports.  The central bank in Prague last week cut the  benchmark 
 interest rate  to a record low 0.5 percent, half a percentage-
point below the  European Central Bank ’s main rate, saying the
government’s plan to introduce more austerity measures will
further depress consumer demand and tame inflationary pressures.  New orders fell at a slower rate in June, compared with
May, while production was “broadly” unchanged and companies
increased workforce after cutting staff in the previous month,
HSBC said in the PMI statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
