Evraz Plc (EVR) , a Russian steelmaker part-
owned by billionaire  Roman Abramovich , agreed with lenders to
alter covenants on a $950 million syndicated loan maturing in
2015 and a number of bilateral facilities.  The maximum acceptable ratio of net debt-to-earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was raised to 3.5
from 3 previously, Evraz said today in a statement. The company
was also allowed by lenders to reduce the minimum ratio of
Ebitda to interest expenses to 3 from 3.5 previously, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
