The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
rose 1.2 percent to 911.50 by the close in Prague.  The following were among the most active  equities  in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   of  Austria  gained for a
fourth day, adding 3 percent to 392.6 koruna. Better-than-
forecast manufacturing data in Europe, Japan and China boosted
bets on a global recovery.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  , the Czech unit of Societe
Generale SA, advanced 2.3 percent to 3,580 koruna. Factory
output in the euro region contracted less than initially
estimated in June, London-based Markit Economics said today,
after Japan’s Tankan index of large manufacturers’ sentiment and
China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index exceeded economist estimates.  Unipetrol AS (UNIP)  , the largest Czech refiner, fell the
most in two months after saying it will discontinue production
at its Paramo unit. The shares dropped 1.1 percent to 169
koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
