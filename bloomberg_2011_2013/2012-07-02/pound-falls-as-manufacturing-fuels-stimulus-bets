The pound weakened against the dollar
as reports showing that U.K. manufacturing output contracted and
house prices stagnated last month added weight to calls for the
 Bank of England  to expand stimulus measures this week.  Sterling declined versus most of its 16 major peers tracked
by Bloomberg as investors bet the central bank would extend its
money-printing program, damping demand for the U.K currency. The
Monetary Policy Committee will raise its  target for bond
purchases  on July 5, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. Gilts were little changed.  “Manufacturing output is shrinking and the second quarter
was certainly weaker than the first, which on the margin
increases the likelihood of further easing” from the Bank of
England, said  Chris Walker , a currency strategist at UBS AG in
 London . “As we get relative balance sheet expansion from the
Bank of England we could see the pound pushing towards $1.50.”  The pound fell 0.2 percent to $1.5676 at 1 p.m. London
time, after sliding as much as 0.4 percent. It was 0.3 percent
stronger at 80.41 pence per euro.  UBS forecasts sterling will slide to $1.55 within one month
and $1.50 within three months, Walker said.  A  gauge of factory output  was at 48.6 from 45.9 in May,
Markit Economics said on its website today. The median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey of 25 economists was 46.5. A reading
below 50 indicates contraction.  House prices  stayed unchanged
from May, a Hometrack Ltd. report said.  BOE Target  The Bank of England will raise its target for bond
purchases by 50 billion pounds to 375 billion pounds on July 5,
according to 30 of 41 economists in a Bloomberg news survey.
Eight, including UBS, predict an increase to 400 billion pounds,
and the rest see a smaller gain or no change.  Data on June 28 showed gross domestic product shrank 0.3
percent in the first quarter, confirming the U.K. economy is in
its first double-dip recession since the 1970s.  U.K. debt returned 2.1 percent in the first half of 2012,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
2 percent, and U.S. Treasuries rose 1.7 percent.  The yield on the 10-year gilt was little changed at 1.74
percent today. It earlier slid six basis points to 1.68 percent.
The 4 percent bond due March 2022 changed hands at 120.025.  The Debt Management Office plans to auction 1.75 billion
pounds of bonds due in December 2030 tomorrow, and 4.5 billion
pounds of notes maturing in September 2017 the following day.

6.  The pound has strengthened 1.5 percent in the past six
months, the second-best performer after the  New Zealand dollar ,
