Asia ’s gasoil crack spread widened,
signaling rising profit for refiners making the distillate fuel.
Gunvor Group Ltd. sold gasoline to Glencore International Plc in
Singapore for a second day.  Middle Distillates  The premium of  gasoil , or diesel, to Asian benchmark Dubai
crude increased 57 cents to $17.45 a barrel at 5:25 p.m.
Singapore time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd.,
a broker. This  crack spread , a measure of processing profit, was
the widest in seven days.  BP Plc sold 100,000 barrels of  jet fuel  to Royal Dutch
Shell Plc for July 14 to July 18 loading, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of traders who monitored transactions on
the Platts window. The cargo changed hands at 10 cents a barrel
above benchmark quotes.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil was unchanged for a second day
at 75 cents a barrel, PVM said. This  regrade  tripled from the
first quarter to the second, meaning it was more profitable to
make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Light Distillates  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose to $53.88 a metric ton at 5:08 p.m. Singapore time,
from $18.17 on June 29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
This crack spread declined 86 percent in the three months to
June, the biggest quarterly slump in at least a year, when
Bloomberg began tracking the data.  Gunvor sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline to Glencore
at $100.90 a barrel, according to the Bloomberg survey. The
Cyprus-based trader will load the shipment from July 24 to July
28.  Trafigura Beheer BV sold a similar-sized 92-RON cargo for
loading from July 28 to Aug. 1 to Vitol Group at $101.10 a
barrel, the survey showed.  Fuel Oil  Shell bought 20,000 tons of 380-centistoke  fuel oil  from
Mercuria Energy Ltd. at $4 a ton over benchmark quotes,
according to the Bloomberg survey. The cargo is for July 17 to
July 21 loading.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened for the third
time in four days to $1.19 a barrel at 5:25 p.m. Singapore time,
PVM data showed. That’s the largest discount since June 7,
indicating widening losses for refiners turning crude into
residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged after climbing to
$10.50 a ton, PVM said. This signals bunker, or marine fuel,
moved in tandem with supplies used in power stations.  Refinery News  Privately held refineries in  China ’s Shandong province,
also known as teapot plants, cut processing to 25.7 percent of
their designed capacity in the week ended June 28, according to
Oilchem.net. That’s the lowest rate since April 2010.  Tenders  Hindustan Petroleum Corp. offered to sell as much as 30,000
tons of 1 percent sulfur gasoil for July loading from
Visakhapatnam, said two traders who asked not to be identified
because the information is confidential.  Bharat Petroleum Corp. sought to buy 7,000 tons of 100-RON
reformate for August delivery to Haldia, said two traders who
asked not to be identified because the information is
confidential.  To contact the reporters on this story:
