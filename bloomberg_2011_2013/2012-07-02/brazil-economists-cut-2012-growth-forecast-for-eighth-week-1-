Analysts covering the Brazilian
economy cut their growth forecast for the eighth straight week
even as the government steps up efforts to bolster a recovery.  The world’s sixth-largest economy will grow 2.05 in 2012,
according to the median estimate in a central bank survey of
about 100 analysts published today. A week earlier, analysts
forecast growth of 2.18 percent.  Consumer prices  will rise 4.93 percent in 2012, down from
4.95 percent in the previous week’s survey. Over the next 12
months inflation will reach 5.5 percent, up from 5.48 percent in
the June 22 survey.  The government last week stepped up government equipment
purchases by 6.6 billion reais and increased crop financing by
14.8 billion reais, the latest in a series of measures including
tax breaks on industrial and consumer goods to help stimulate
demand.  Brazil ’s economy expanded 2.7 percent in 2011, down from
7.5 percent in 2010.  Brazil’s  economy  grew by a lower-than-expected 0.8 percent
in the first quarter from a year earlier, as manufacturers lost
ground to foreign competitors and indebted consumers showed
signs of easing demand. Last week, the central bank lowered its
growth forecast for this year to 2.5 percent, from 3.5 percent.  The central bank has lowered its benchmark Selic rate by
400 basis points since August to 8.5 percent. Economists
maintained their call for policy makers to cut the rate to 7.5
percent this year, the survey showed. The bank targets inflation
of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
