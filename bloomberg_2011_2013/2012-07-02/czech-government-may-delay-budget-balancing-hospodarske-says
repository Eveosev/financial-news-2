The Czech government may delay
balancing public finances beyond the planned goal of 2016
because of slower economic growth, Hospodarske Noviny reported,
citing Premier Petr Necas.  The Cabinet will stick to its goal of reducing the fiscal
shortfall to less than 3 percent of gross domestic product, the
newspaper quoted Necas as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
