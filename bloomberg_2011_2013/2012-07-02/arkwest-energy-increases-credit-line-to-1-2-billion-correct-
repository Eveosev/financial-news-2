(Corrects number of lenders in third paragraph of story
published June 29.)  MarkWest Energy Partners LP (MWE) , a
natural-gas processor, increased the size of a credit line to
$1.2 billion and extended its maturity by one year.  The company added $300 million to the loan, which now
matures in September 2017, according to a statement distributed
by  Business Wire .  Wells Fargo & Co. and Royal Bank of Canada arranged the
financing with 15 additional lenders signing on, the Denver-
based company said.  “This expansion significantly increases our liquidity and
financial flexibility, which are important elements of our
ongoing growth strategy,” Frank Semple, chairman and chief
executive officer said in the statement.  MarkWest obtained the original credit in February 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
