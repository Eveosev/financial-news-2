The value of German hotel
acquisitions in the first half fell about 65 percent as buyers
found it more difficult to borrow money,  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL) 
said.  Investors bought about 170 million euros ($214 million)
hotels, down from about 500 million euros a year earlier, the
Chicago-based real estate brokerage said in a statement today.  “Although large individual hotels or portfolios are on the
market, they haven’t yet found buyers,” Thorsten Faasch, head
of hotel investments at JLL, said in the statement.  Wealthy individuals are increasingly investing along with
private-equity firms and other institutions, Faasch said. “This
group is less dependent on  capital markets  and can easily buy a
hotel without outside financing,” he said.  Investments in all of 2012 will probably fall short of last
year’s volume of about 1 billion euros, JLL said. German buyers
made more than half of the acquisitions. Foreign investors will
probably be more active in Germany as they look for stable
economies to invest in, JLL said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
