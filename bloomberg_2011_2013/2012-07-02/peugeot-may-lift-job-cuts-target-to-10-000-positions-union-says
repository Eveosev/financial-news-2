PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  plans to shed as
much as 10 percent of its French workforce this year, more than
previously announced, as sales slide and management seeks
further savings, a union official said.  “They will raise the job cuts target in  France  alone to
8,000-10,000,” Christian Lafaye, the head of Peugeot’s second-
biggest union FO, said in an interview. Paris-based Peugeot,
Europe’s second-largest  automaker , said in November it aimed to
reduce headcount by 6,000 in the region.  Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin told unions last
week the carmaker will need to raise its 2012 savings target of
1 billion euros ($1.26 billion), according to Franck Don, a CFTC
union representative. Peugeot’s five-month sales in  Europe  have
plunged 15 percent, outpacing a 7.3 percent industrywide drop.
The shares last month slid to a 23-year low.  Peugeot may discuss its plans for the carmaker’s
reorganization at the next works council meeting July 12, Lafaye
said. Pierre-Olivier Salmon, a spokesman for Peugeot, declined
to comment. Peugeot  employed  100,356 people on permanent and
temporary contracts in France at the end of 2011. Worldwide, it
had 209,019 workers at the end of last year.  Shares Advance  Peugeot  climbed  as much as 35 cents, or 4.6 percent, to
7.80 euros and was up 3 percent as of 4:51 p.m. in Paris trading
today. The stock has slumped 71 percent in the last 12 months,
the steepest decline on the 14-member Stoxx 600 Automobiles &
Parts Index and valuing the automaker at 2.72 billion euros.  “Some investors are reacting positively to the news that
the company is making progress in its restructuring,” said
Xavier Caroen, a Kepler Capital Markets analyst in Zurich with a
“buy” recommendation on the shares. “The stock has been hit a
lot since the beginning of the year, seeing management possibly
advancing on this subject is well appreciated by the markets.”  Peugeot’s French factories in Aulnay, which employs 3,300,
and Rennes are most at risk of being shut down as cooperation
with  General Motors Co. (GM)  adds to pressure, Don said last month.
GM announced plans June 14 to shut a factory in Bochum,  Germany ,
at the end of 2016.  “The problem is that you don’t need to resize plants, you
just need to close them now,” said Philippe Houchois, an
automotive analyst at UBS in  London . “By only reducing the size
of factories, you may end up having chronically weak plants in
terms of profitability.”  GM Alliance  The French carmaker set up a strategic alliance with GM in
March in which the U.S. automaker became Peugeot’s second-
largest shareholder after the founding family. GM paid 320
million euros for a 7 percent stake. Peugeot in March also sold
1 billion euros in new stock to existing shareholders and has
announced asset sales, including plans to sell a stake in its
profitable Gefco trucking unit.  Peugeot’s  revenue per employee  in 2011 was 286,634 euros,
compared with sales per worker at  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s
largest carmaker, of 317,432 euros, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Net income per employee at Peugeot was 2,813 euros
versus 30,698 euros at VW.  French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault pledged in speech
today to parliament to come up with a plan by the end of the
month to help the country’s automobile industry, without
elaborating on the type of aid the government might provide.  Renault Chief Operating Officer,  Carlos Tavares , said last
month that he would welcome “any kind of measure of support”
from French authorities.  “We are completely open and in favor of such a step,”
whether it takes the form of incentives for new car buyers or
tax breaks for more fuel-efficient vehicles, he said on June 12
at a press conference near Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
