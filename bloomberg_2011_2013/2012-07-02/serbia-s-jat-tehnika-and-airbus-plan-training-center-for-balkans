JAT Tehnika,  Serbia ’s aircraft
maintenance company, said it will expand into servicing  Airbus
SAS’s (EAD)  jets this year as it agreed with the aircraft maker to set
up a training center for handling its 310 and 320-series planes.  Certification of JAT Tehnika for servicing the Airbus jets
is expected in the third quarter, after which the companies will
establish a “regional training center for third parties,” said
Srdjan Miskovic, JAT Tehnika’s general manager in a phone
interview today. The agreement was signed at Airbus’
headquarters in Toulouse last week, he said.  “It will open a big market for us because some 60 percent
of air traffic in the region of southeastern  Europe  is done with
Airbus” planes, he said. Belgrade-based JAT Tehnika’s revenue
is seen rising at least 30 percent, after the license is added
to the existing ones for  Boeing Co. (BA)  and ATR aircraft, he said.  The government failed to sell JAT Tehnika in 2008, when it
was unprofitable, and has no immediate plans to offer it again,
Miskovic said. JAT Tehnika’s sales rose 52 percent to 2.93
billion dinars ($32 million) last year, while net income almost
quadrupled to 6 million dinars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
