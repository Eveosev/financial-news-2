Peru may post a trade deficit for a
second straight month after exports dropped in May on falling
metal prices, an exporter group said.  Exports fell by almost 20 percent from a year earlier while
imports climbed 9 percent, exporters association Adex said in an
e-mailed statement citing preliminary customs data.  The Andean nation registered an $84 million trade deficit
in April, its first gap in three years, as slower global growth
curbed demand for metals that account for two-thirds of its
shipments overseas. The national statistics agency is scheduled
to release its May report July 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
