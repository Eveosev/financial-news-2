AMR Corp.’s  American Airlines  won
court approval for new labor agreements with five groups
represented by the Transport Workers Union as the airline works
to reach deals with pilots and flight attendants.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane in Manhattan said at a
court hearing today that American, which is seeking to cut labor
costs as part of its restructuring, can enter into the new
agreements.  The approval comes as pilots at American are set to vote on
new contract terms with the airline. Flight attendants and two
other TWU groups that haven’t reached agreements with the
carrier are planning to resume talks.  The TWU groups that settled include more than 10,500
baggage handlers and other aircraft ground workers, dispatchers
and instructors.  Lane has agreed to hold off ruling on American’s request to
reject labor agreements with the pilots, flight attendants,
mechanics and stock clerks, according to the company. The judge
was set to rule tomorrow.  The case is In re  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) , 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
