Dwyane Wade  needs surgery on his
left knee and will miss the Olympics in London, according to the
 Associated Press .  The Miami Heat All-Star guard, who led the U.S. men’s
basketball team in scoring during its run to an Olympic gold
medal in 2008, told AP he called USA Basketball Chairman Jerry Colangelo and coach  Mike Krzyzewski  today to let them know that
he isn’t healthy enough to play in the games, which open July 27.
Wade is in the process of scheduling the surgery.  E-mails seeking comment from Tim Donovan, a spokesman for
the Heat, and Craig Miller, a spokesman for  Colorado Springs ,
Colorado-based USA Basketball, weren’t immediately returned.  The 30-year-old Wade was limited by injuries to 49 of the
Heat’s 66 games during the lockout-shortened regular season. He
averaged 22.8 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists during the
playoffs as Miami won the National Basketball Association title,
beating the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games.  Wade’s left knee has caused him problems for years. He
missed 21 games to end the 2007-08 NBA season as he recuperated
from injuries to the knee prior to participating in the Beijing
Olympics. He also had surgery on the knee in May 2007.  Wade played on the U.S. team that won an Olympic bronze
medal in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
