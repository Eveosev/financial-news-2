European power producers will find
it more difficult to generate electricity profitably as the
economic crisis cuts demand,  Fitch Ratings  said in a report.  The power industry faces “an uncertain investment
framework for the non-renewables business,” Fitch said today.
The rating agency pointed to falling margins in thermal
generation because of weak consumption and the full auctioning
of carbondioxide emissions allowances from 2013.  “Pure generators are the most vulnerable, while the rating
impact will be more limited for integrated utilities,” Fitch
said.  German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler Roesler said
declining profits for power producers is cutting investment.  “We don’t find anyone who invests in gas power stations
because it doesn’t pay off,” Roesler said today in Berlin at a
conference organized by the BDEW, a lobby group for German
utilities. “We will not only need renewable energies but also
conventional power stations, gas and coal power stations.”  Credit pressure could most probably result from unfavorable
changes to energy policies related to a political preference for
renewable energy, according to Fitch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
