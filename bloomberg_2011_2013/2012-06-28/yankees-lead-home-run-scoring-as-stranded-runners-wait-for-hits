The  New York Yankees ’ ability to hit
home runs is helping them overcome a league-worst average of
hitting with runners in scoring position.  A Major League Baseball-best 51.8 percent of the Yankees’
runs this season came on homers, nine percentage points higher
than 2011, according to Bloomberg Sports data. The team’s
batting average with runners in scoring position -- on second or
third base -- is .225, 48 points below their 2011 average and 13
points lower than the Seattle Mariners, the next worst American
League team in that category.  “It’s a great sign,” said Aaron Boone, the former Yankees
third baseman who is a now an analyst for ESPN. “They get on
base and they hit home runs, which is going to lead to a lot of
crooked numbers. Runners in scoring position is something that
over time is going to balance itself out a little bit, just
because they’re too good of hitters.”  The Yankees, leading the American League East with a 46-28
record, have 117 homers, the most in baseball and almost twice
as many as the New York Mets (62). Center fielder  Curtis Granderson ’s 21 homers lead six Yankees with more than 10,
joining  Robinson Cano  (18),  Alex Rodriguez  (13),  Nick Swisher 
and  Mark Teixeira  (12), and Raul Ibanez (11).  Cano, who is leading the American League All-Star balloting
at second base, has a .174 batting average with runners in
scoring position, the worst of those six players. Rodriguez is
next lowest at .206, followed by Teixeira (.217), Granderson
(.226), Ibanez (.230) and Swisher (.275).  Shortstop  Derek Jeter , whose seven home runs already top
his six from all of last season, has a .293 batting average with
runners in scoring position, below his .302 career mark.  Sixth in RBI  The Yankees’ 339 runs batted in are sixth in baseball and
56 fewer than the Texas Rangers, who lead with 395.  The Rangers, who’ve been to two straight  World Series , and
the Los Angeles Angels are going to be New York’s stiffest
competition in the playoffs, said Boone, whose Game 7 American
League pennant-clinching home run sent the Yankees past the
Boston Red Sox and into the 2003 World Series.  “The way this team is shaping up, they look like a great
team built for the regular season,” Boone, speaking from Los
Angeles while promoting a Little League Baseball  initiative  with
Subway Restaurants, said in a telephone interview. “Is their
rotation dominant enough to be a great Yankee postseason team?
That’s the question that I have that remains to be seen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
