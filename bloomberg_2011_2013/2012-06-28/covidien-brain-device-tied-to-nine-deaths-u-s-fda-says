Covidien Plc (COV) ’s Onyx system used to
block blood flow in abnormally formed vessels in the brain has
been linked to nine deaths, U.S. regulators said.  The  Food and Drug Administration  received more than 100
reports since 2005 about breakage related to a catheter used to
help the Onyx liquid material obstruct the blood vessels before
they are surgically removed, the agency said today in an  alert 
on its website. In at least 54 cases, the catheter and some of
the liquid material remained implanted because the device
couldn’t be removed, the FDA said.  Covidien, based in County Dublin, Ireland, updated the
labeling of the  Onyx Liquid Embolic System  to warn about the
risks related to catheter entrapment. The FDA approved the
labeling changes in April, the agency said. If the catheter
can’t be removed, surgeons still probably will be able to take
out the abnormally formed blood vessels, according to the FDA.
The agency warned that complications from long-term implantation
of the catheter and the liquid material can be serious.  “The most serious complications include hemorrhage and
death,” FDA said. “Other complications include migration of
the Onyx plug or catheter fragment to other parts of the body.”  Patients who experience catheter entrapment may need to
take antithrombotic drugs to reduce the risk of blood clots, the
agency recommended.  To contact the reporter on this story:
