The Brazilian government said 115.2
billion reais ($55.1 billion) will be allocated for agricultural
loans during the 2012-2013 season, a 7.5 percent increase from
current levels.  Of that amount, 86.9 billion reais will go toward costs and
sale of the crops, according to an official document distributed
in Brasilia today. The funds include government and private
banking money.  The  interest rate  for agricultural credit will be 5.5
percent a year, compared to 6.75 percent last season, the
government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
