Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
may block the 120 billion-euro ($149 billion) growth initiative
announced by European Union President Herman Van Rompuy without
an effort to reduce its borrowing costs, two Italian officials
said.  Italy is withholding its official endorsement as it pushes
for collective action at an EU summit in Brussels to push down
its bond yields, said the officials who spoke on the condition
that they not be named.  To contact the reporter on this story:
