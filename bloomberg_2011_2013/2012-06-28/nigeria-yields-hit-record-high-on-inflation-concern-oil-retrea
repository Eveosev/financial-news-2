Nigeria ’s five-year borrowing costs
hit a record high at a debt auction yesterday on concern
inflation is reaching the fastest in more than two years and as
oil, the country’s key export, slumped.  The Debt Management Office sold 84 billion naira ($516
million) of bonds, including 30 billion naira of debt due 2017
at a yield of 15.859 percent, 61 basis points higher than the
previous sale on May 16. Bids declined 13 percent to 55.84
billion naira, the Abuja-based agency said in a statement on its
website today. Nigeria also sold 23.9 billion naira of notes due
2022, with yields 76 basis points higher at 16.21 percent and
bids down by about a half to 33.68 billion naira.  While  inflation  slowed to 12.7 percent in May from 12.9
percent in April, the rate is set to peak at 14.5 percent in the
third quarter, the highest since April 2010, according to the
 Central Bank of Nigeria . Policy makers have held the  benchmark
interest rate  at 12 percent this year to curb the naira’s
decline and combat inflation, after raising it by 5.75
percentage points in 2011. The nation’s bonny light crude fell
to $93.69 a barrel today from $128.47 a barrel on March 13.  “The anticipated outlook that inflation would rise have
made investors soft pedal on their investment decisions on
bonds,” Sewa Wusu, an analyst at Lagos-based Sterling Capital
Ltd., said by phone today.  Nigeria also sold 30 billion naira of new debt due 2019 at
a yield of 16 percent. Another 20 billion naira of debt due in
2019 and 28.7 billion naira of notes due in 2022 were allotted
on a non-competitive basis, the debt management agency said.  “What we have seen is that banks have been pushing yields
higher while PFAs were somewhat more conservative in their
bids,”  Samir Gadio , an emerging-markets strategist at Standard
Bank Group Ltd. in  London , said in an e-mailed response to
questions, referring to pension fund administrators. “This
suggests financial institutions were probably keen to re-enter
the  bond market  at more attractive levels. We suspect yields
have peaked for now as market players and PFAs will take
advantage of these appealing rates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
