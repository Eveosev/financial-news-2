Crude-oil options volatility rose as
underlying futures slipped for the first time in three days.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 32.04 percent at 2:15 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , up from 30.07 percent yesterday.
It was the first increase in three days.  “Investors are more afraid of the downside,” said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in Tampa,
 Florida .  Crude oil for August delivery fell $2.78, or 3.5 percent,
to $77.43 a barrel at 2:17 p.m. on the Nymex.  Oil dropped on concern the U.S. recovery is slowing and
European leaders won’t be able to contain the region’s debt
crisis. Losses were extended as equities declined when the
 Supreme Court  upheld the core of President  Barack Obama ’s
health-care plan, which expands insurance to millions of people.  “A lot of investors were surprised by the court’s ruling
and some will see it as business negative,” Cordier said.  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
were August $75 puts, which advanced 71 cents to $1.35 a barrel
at 2:18 p.m. with 2,835 lots trading. August $70 puts were the
second-most active options, with 2,754 lots changing hands as
they rose 22 cents to 36 cents.  Puts accounted for 60 percent of electronic trading volume.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish bets accounted for 59 percent of the 127,463
contracts traded in the previous session. August $85 calls were
the most actively traded, with 6,407 lots changing hands. They
rose 7 cents to 60 cents. The next-most active options, August
$90 calls, were unchanged at 12 cents on volume of 4,880.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 45,080
contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 39,436 lots and
December $70 puts with 38,381.  To contact the reporter on this story:
