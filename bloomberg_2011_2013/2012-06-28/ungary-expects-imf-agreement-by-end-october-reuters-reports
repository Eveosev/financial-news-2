Hungary expects to sign an agreement
with the  International Monetary Fund  and the European Union on a
 credit line  of “close to” 15 billion euros ($19 billion) by
the end of October at the latest, Reuters reported, citing
Mihaly Varga, the country’s chief bailout negotiator.  An agreement may be completed “any time from mid-August
until the end of October,” Varga told Reuters in an interview.
The government is seeking a flexible credit line rather than a
standby agreement from the Washington-based lender, Varga said,
