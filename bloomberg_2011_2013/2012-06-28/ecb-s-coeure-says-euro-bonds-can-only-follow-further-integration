European Central Bank Executive
Board member Benoit Coeure said common euro-area debt issuance
could only follow deeper political integration in  Europe .  “Common funding instruments would require shared decision
making on national debts and deficits and probably joint control
on fiscal expenditures and taxation,” Coeure said in a speech
in Rio de Janiero today, according to a text provided by the
Frankfurt-based ECB. “They can only result from further
political integration; they cannot precede it.”  Coeure also said joint debt issuance cannot be a substitute
for “putting national fiscal houses in order and restoring
competiveness.”  He said it would be helpful if Europe’s permanent rescue
fund, the European Stability Mechanism, could directly inject
capital into troubled banks.  “Of course, such support must come with strong
conditionality and control,” Coeure said. “Let me note that
depending on its design, the financial union could introduce
additional elements of risk-sharing among euro-area countries,
and as such, it should be subject to strong democratic
accountability and control at national and European level.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
