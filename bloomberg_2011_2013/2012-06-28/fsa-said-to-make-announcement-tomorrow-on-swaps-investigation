The U.K.  Financial Services
Authority  will make an announcement tomorrow on its
investigation into claims that banks improperly sold interest-
rate derivatives to small businesses, two people familiar with
the situation said.  The details of the announcement are still being discussed,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
negotiations are private. Sky News reported today that the FSA
would unveil a plan to compensate bank customers who had been
improperly sold interest-rate swaps.  Companies made around 605 complaints last year over banks’
bundling of interest-rate swaps with loans, FSA Chairman  Adair
Turner  said in a letter to lawmakers last month. The London-
based watchdog initially didn’t see any “widespread, underlying
issues” with the practice and instructed firms to review their
sales systems, Turner said.  Rate swaps are contracts that convert floating-rate debt
into fixed-rate debt, or vice versa. They are supposed to keep
payments within a specific range. When interest rates fall, for
example, customers might pay less interest on a loan to balance
out the higher cost of the swap.  Officials at  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc (RBS) , and Lloyds Banking Group Plc declined to comment. A
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  spokeswoman declined to immediately comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
