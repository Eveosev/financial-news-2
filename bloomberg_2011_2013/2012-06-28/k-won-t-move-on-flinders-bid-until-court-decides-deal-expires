OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel (MMK) , the
steelmaker whose proposed takeover of  Australia ’s  Flinders Mines
Ltd. (FMS)  has been blocked by a Russian court, won’t take any further
action on the bid until the case is heard on July 2.  “Magnitogorsk’s decision on its future actions regarding
the agreement will be taken only when the results of the court
hearings are known,” Kirill Golubkov, a spokesman, said today
by phone. The offer period ends June 30, meaning it will expire 
before Magnitogorsk makes any decision on extending the bid.  The Russian steelmaker, known as MMK, saw its A$554 million
($558 million) takeover offer blocked after minority investor
Elena Egorova won a court decision in March preventing the deal,
claiming it discriminated against her interests as a
shareholder.  The case will be heard at the Chelyabinsk court, which this
month dismissed an appeal from MMK to lift the injunction on the
deal. MMK agreed to acquire the Adelaide-based iron-ore producer
in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
