A rally in oil-tanker rates will be
delayed and smaller than previously anticipated as consuming
nations draw upon existing stockpiles and curb imports, said
Jonathan Chappell, an analyst at  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR)   “We have been forecasting all year that the third quarter
would mark the trough of the tanker market in 2012,” Chappell,
who’s based in  New York , said in an e-mailed report yesterday.
“We believe it is now more likely for the summer trough to be
even deeper and for a 4Q12 rebound to end up being more modest
than our prior views.”  Shipping costs on the largest tankers rose in the first
half of the year as oil-consuming countries imported more to
build stockpiles because of tensions surrounding  Iran’s nuclear
program , Chappell said. The European Union announced an embargo
in January on purchasing, financing, insuring and transporting
Iran’s crude. The ban takes full effect next month. The Persian
Gulf country threatened to retaliate by disrupting tanker
traffic through the  Strait of Hormuz , a transit point for about
20 percent of the world’s traded oil.  Earnings for very large crude carriers hauling 2 million-
barrel cargoes averaged $26,000 a day in the first half compared
with $19,500 a year earlier, Chappell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
