Japan ’s imports of nickel ore from
Indonesia jumped 81 percent in May from a year earlier, finance
ministry data showed, as buyers stepped up purchase before the
Southeast Asian nation curbed shipments.  Inbound shipments of nickel ore from Indonesia soared to
200,176 metric tons last month, compared with 110,679 tons a
year earlier, the finance ministry  data  showed today. Japan
imported 171,685 tons of ore from Indonesia in April. Nickel is
used to strengthen stainless steel.  Indonesia, the largest producer, said May 3 it would ban
exports of some raw minerals effective May 6, with an exception
for miners that plan to build local processing facilities. Those
miners would be assessed for a 20 percent tax on ore shipments.  Japan imported 3.65 million tons of ore in 2011, according
to finance ministry data. Indonesia supplied 1.95 million tons,
or 53 percent, followed by  New Caledonia  with 27 percent and the
Philippines with 19 percent, the data showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
