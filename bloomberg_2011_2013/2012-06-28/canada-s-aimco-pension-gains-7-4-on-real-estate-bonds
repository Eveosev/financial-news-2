Alberta Investment Management Corp.,
 Canada ’s fourth-biggest pension-fund manager, posted a 7.4
percent return on investments last year, helped by holdings of
real estate and long-term bonds.  Investment income was C$5.16 billion ($5.03 billion) for
the year ended March 31, Leo de Bever, chief executive officer
for the  Edmonton , Alberta-based fund, said in an interview. The
fund’s assets rose 1.3 percent to C$69.7 billion from a year
ago, according to its annual report released today.  AIMCo, as the fund is known, beat the 3.2 percent median
return of the country’s pension funds over the 12 months,
according to RBC Dexia Investor Services.  AIMCo was established in January 2008 to manage investments
for Alberta’s provincial government, public pension plans and
endowments, including the C$16.4 billion Alberta Heritage
Savings Trust Fund. AIMCo oversaw about C$54.7 billion in
balanced funds, which posted an 8.2 percent return. Government
funds had a 4.2 percent return.  Real estate holdings returned 23 percent, while timberlands
assets climbed 20 percent, according to the annual report. The
fund’s long bonds portfolio returned 17 percent, compared with
7.5 percent for its money-market and fixed-income investments.
Private equity rose 13 percent, and stocks increased 2.4
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
