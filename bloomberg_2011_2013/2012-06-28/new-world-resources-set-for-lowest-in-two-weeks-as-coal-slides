New World Resources Plc (NWR)  fell, set
for its lowest in more than two weeks, as fuel prices slid.  The stock dropped 1.4 percent to 97.6 koruna by 10:38 a.m.
in Prague. A close at that level would be its lowest since June
12.  Europe â€™s benchmark  coal  derivatives slid 0.8 percent to $98
a metric ton in the Netherlands.  NWR named Gareth Penny its new executive chairman, the
biggest Czech producer of coking coal said in a statement today.
Penny will replace Mike Salamon on Oct. 1, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
