The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 0.4 percent to 574.93 at 4:21 p.m.  Singapore 
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials dropped
0.21 percent to 1440.559.  CRUDE OIL  Oil declined in London for the first time in five days as
the leaders of the European Union gathered in Brussels for a
two-day summit.  Brent oil for August settlement fell as much as 66 cents to
$92.84 a barrel and was at $93.02 at 8:44 a.m. on the London-
based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. The European benchmark’s
premium to New York-traded West Texas Intermediate narrowed to
$12.90 from $12.84 yesterday. Brent has lost 24 percent this
quarter, the steepest slide since the last three months of 2008.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold climbed, paring the biggest quarterly decline since
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., before European
leaders meet to discuss the debt crisis.  Spot gold rose as much as 0.3 percent to $1,579.15 an
ounce, and was at $1,575.48 by 2:39 p.m. in Singapore. The metal
has lost 5.5 percent since March 30, set for the worst showing
since the three months to September 2008, as investors favored
the dollar as a hedge against market turmoil.  August-delivery gold was little changed at $1,576.40 an
ounce on the Comex in  New York , after declining 0.3 percent
earlier. The Dollar Index is 4.2 percent higher this quarter,
while the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of commodities has lost
16 percent.  Spot silver rose for the first time in three days, gaining
as much as 0.8 percent to $27.1425 an ounce, and was last at
$27.0225. The worst-performing precious metal this quarter is 16
percent lower since the end of March, set for the worst
quarterly loss since the three months to September 2008.  Cash platinum climbed as much as 0.6 percent to $1,418.25
an ounce, advancing for the first day in three. The metal, last
trading at $1,413.48, is down 14 percent this quarter, poised
for the worst performance since the period to September 2008.  BASE METALS  Copper climbed for a fourth day after reports showed U.S.
home sales and durable goods orders rose more than expected.  Three-month copper advanced as much as 0.6 percent to
$7,449.50 a metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange, the highest
since June 21. The contract traded at $7,436.25 by 3 p.m.
Shanghai time, and is set for a 12 percent slump this quarter,
the worst performance since the three months ended September.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn futures advanced, extending the biggest four-day rally
in 14 months, as dry, hot weather deepens yield losses in the
U.S., threatening global supply.  December-delivery corn gained 0.9 percent to $6.3875 a
bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade at 3:03 p.m. Singapore
time, after surging 15 percent in the past four days.  Soybeans for November delivery were little changed at
$14.135 a bushel in Chicago, while wheat for September delivery
lost 0.2 percent to $7.4975 a bushel.  Rubber advanced to a one-week high after U.S. and Japanese
economic data beat forecasts and  Thailand , the world’s biggest
supplier, said it will discuss possible curbs on exports with
Indonesia and  Malaysia .  The December-delivery contract gained 2.1 percent to end at
240.3 yen a kilogram ($3,025 a metric ton), the highest
settlement level since June 21, on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange.
The most-active contract has plunged 26 percent this quarter,
the worst performance since the final three months of 2008, on
concern that Europe’s debt crisis may derail the global
recovery.  Palm oil  dropped for a second day on speculation that
output will climb in Malaysia, the second-largest producer,
boosting global cooking-oil inventories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
