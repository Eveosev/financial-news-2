Michael Phelps  beat  Ryan Lochte  and
17-year-old Missy Franklin swam a U.S. record to earn her first
trip to the  Olympic Games .  Phelps won the 200-meter freestyle final in 1 minute, 45.70
seconds, with Lochte touching the wall five hundredths of a
second later in second place at the U.S. swimming trials last
night in Omaha,  Nebraska .  “The turns are something that really killed me in the
semifinals,” Phelps said in a televised interview. “I wanted
to jump on it in the first 100 and get a good start.”  Phelps in 2008 won eight Olympic gold medals to eclipse the
single-Games record of seven set by fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz in 1972. His haul in Beijing took his tally of Olympic
golds to 14, surpassing the previous career record of nine.  Lochte said he didn’t give the race his ultimate effort.  “We didn’t really try to pick it up until, like, the last
75, so I’ll save that for the Olympics,” Lochte said. “I was
just really relaxed for the first 125, and then the last 75, I
was like, ‘All right, now we’ve got to put it in gear.’ So I
kind of waited a little late, but I’ll take it.”  Lochte, 27, beat Phelps, 26, in their first meeting of the
trials three days ago -- the 400-meter individual medley, in
which Phelps is the Olympic champion and Lochte is the world
champion.  ‘One Back’  “Glad I got one back,” Phelps said. “We’re going to have
a lot more of these.”  The two will meet once more in the 200-meter individual
medley. The semifinals are tomorrow, with the final the
following day.  Franklin, who collected three gold medals at last year’s
world championships, won the 100-meter backstroke final in 58.85
seconds. Rachel Bootsma, 18, was second in 59.49, ahead of
Natalie Coughlin, who won the event at the 2004 and 2008 Games.  “I can’t even put it in words,” said Franklin. “It means
so much to me.”  Franklin said Coughlin, 29, was her role model during her
early years of swimming. She said she wants Coughlin to qualify
for the team.  Coughlin’s last chance to be on her third Olympic team is
the 100-meter freestyle. The semifinals will be tomorrow and the
finals on June 30.  ‘Little Bummed’  “It’s not exactly what I was hoping for coming into
this,” Coughlin said. “I’m a little bummed, but not nearly as
much as everyone is expecting me to be. I have another shot to
make the team in the 100 free, and I’m looking forward to that.
For the rest of this season, I’m a freestyler.”  Breeja Larson will also be going to her first Olympics
after winning the women’s 100-meter breaststroke final in
1:05.92, seven hundredths faster than Rebecca Soni.  Matt Grevers won the men’s 100-meter backstroke in 52.08
seconds. Nick Thoman, who covered the distance in 52.86 seconds,
captured the second Olympic spot for the U.S. in that event.  “It was comfortable,” Grevers said. “Perfect training.”  Thoman said he couldn’t believe he secured a spot in the
Olympics.  “I looked at the scoreboard, looked back and looked
again,” he said. “I didn’t realize I made it.”  Today’s finals are the women’s 200-meter freestyle and 200-
meter individual medley and the men’s 200-meter butterfly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
