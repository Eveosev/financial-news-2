Electricite de  France  SA plans to
reinforce the concrete base of its Fessenheim atomic reactors by
the middle of next year so it can avoid being forced to close
the generator early, according to the industry regulator.  The base has to be made thicker or the reactors will be
halted, said Andre-Claude Lacoste, head of Autorite de Surete
Nucleaire. “EDF apparently wants to carry out the work.”  The watchdog is considering plans submitted by the utility,
Lacoste told reporters today. The work at the nation’s oldest
reactors will improve containment if there’s a core meltdown.  The Fessenheim plant, in eastern France on the banks of the
Rhine River, was the focus of a debate during presidential
elections about France’s reliance on nuclear power. President
 Francois Hollande  pledged to shut the site, which has two 900-
megawatt reactors that began operating in 1977, at the end of
his five-year mandate in 2017 for safety reasons.  The reinforcement work at the generators “is far from
being a simple operation but we think it’s feasible,” said
Thomas Houdre, director of reactors at the watchdog. It will
“very likely” have to be carried out at both units.  The regulator gave EDF permission to operate Unit 1 at
Fessenheim for another decade on July 4 as long as the base was
made thicker by mid-2013, according to documents on its  website .
The watchdog had already asked in 2009 for this to be studied as
the base is thinner than other generators in France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
