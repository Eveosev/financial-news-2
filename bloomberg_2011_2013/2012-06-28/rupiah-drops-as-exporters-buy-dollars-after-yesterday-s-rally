Indonesia ’s rupiah added to this
month’s loss on speculation exporters took advantage of
yesterday’s biggest rally in three weeks to buy dollars at a
more favorable exchange rate.  The local currency, which advanced 0.6 percent yesterday,
declined as European Union leaders kick off a meeting in
Brussels today to discuss ways to tackle the region’s escalating
debt crisis. Overseas investors trimmed holdings of Indonesian
stocks in June amid concern demand for exports will slow as
global economic growth cools.  “Demand for the dollar has piled up,” said Taufan Tito, a
Jakarta-based foreign-exchange dealer at PT Bank Rakyat
Indonesia. “There are many investors and corporates queuing up
to buy the dollar.”  The rupiah weakened 0.6 percent to 9,502 per dollar as of
3:35 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency is poised for its biggest
quarterly loss since the first three months of 2009, declining
3.7 percent.  One-month implied volatility, which measures  exchange-rate 
swings used to price options, held at 8.5 percent and was down
from 17.5 percent at the end of last month.  Global funds sold $231 million more of the nation’s shares
than they bought in June, according to stock exchange data.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.23
percent, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association. It has declined 28 basis points this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
