OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel (GMKN) ’s board, led
by billionaire  Vladimir Potanin ’s Interros Holding, ordered
management to study the possibility of buying back as much as a
2 percent stake in the Russian metals producer.  Norilsk management will also prepare proposals on how best
to retire a 10 percent stake purchased under a previous buyback
program and now held by its units as quasi-treasury shares,
according to a statement today on its website.  “We expect management to propose the exact share-
 retirement plan  as soon as the middle of July, as the aim is to
cancel the stock by the end of the year,” Andrei Bugrov,
Norilsk’s chairman, said in the phone interview from Moscow.  The board has set no deadline for management to lay out the
buyback plan, Bugrov said. Proposals on cutting 2012 spending
should be ready within a month and a half, he said.  Given the current market situation and volatility, it’s
time to think what projects may be postponed, Bugrov said.  Management will consider changes to the strategy to 2025
based on the results from the current year, Norilsk said in the
statement. The board plans a preliminary strategy review in
September, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
