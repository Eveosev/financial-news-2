Uganda ’s revenue shortfall in the
first 11 months of 2011-12 widened after the duties on oil
imports declined on reduced volumes last month, the Uganda
Revenue Authority said.  The East African nation registered a deficit of 67 billion
shillings from July 1 through May against a target of 5.5
trillion shillings, the authority said today by e-mail from
Kampala, the capital.  Revenue collection in May was 22 billion shillings, below a
target of 522 billion shillings after oil imports declined by 13
percent, it said without giving details. Collection for June may
improve to 646 billion, it said.  Donors fund a quarter of the nation’s budget, according to
the  finance ministry , which says the U.S., the U.K., Denmark,
the European Union, Sweden and Japan are among the main ones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
