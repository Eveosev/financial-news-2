Nigeria ’s naira depreciated to the
lowest in a week as the oil industry demanded dollars for
gasoline imports.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer retreated 0.3
percent to 163.05 per dollar as of 3:56 p.m. in Lagos, the
weakest on a closing basis since June 15, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The naira is down 0.5 percent this year,
after being Africa’s best-performer against the dollar in the
first five months.  Nigeria yesterday approved a tender for the import of 3.135
million metric tons of gasoline in the third quarter, the
Petroleum Products Pricing and Regulatory Agency said.  Africa’s
most populous nation, with more than 160 million inhabitants,
relies on imports to meet 70 percent of its fuel needs because
of inadequate refining capacity, Petroleum Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke said in November.  “Higher dollar demand is induced by  oil companies  that got
approval to import petroleum,” Wale Abe, chief executive of the
Lagos-based Financial Markets Dealers Association, said by
telephone today.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $700 million at foreign-
currency auctions this week, the Abuja-based bank said in an e-
mailed statement. The regulator sold $750 million last week, the
most since the five days to Oct. 12.  Foreign-currency reserves, which rose 12.1 percent this
year, slipped to $36.887 billion, according to the latest data
from the central bank dated June 26. The nation’s bonny light
crude fell to $91.50 a barrel from $128.47 a barrel on March 13.  Inflation  The  inflation rate  fell to 12.7 percent in May from 12.9
percent in April, the National Bureau of Statistics said June
19, staying above the central bank’s target and adding to
expectations interest rates will remain unchanged at a  record
high  of 12 percent.  The yield on Nigeria’s domestic 15.1 percent bonds due 2017
rose to a record, gaining 18 basis points to 16.07 percent,
according to June 27 data on the Financial Markets Dealers
Association website. Yields on the nation’s $500 million of
Eurobonds due 2021 fell five basis points to 5.558 percent
today.  Ghana ’s cedi declined 0.8 percent to 1.9385 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
