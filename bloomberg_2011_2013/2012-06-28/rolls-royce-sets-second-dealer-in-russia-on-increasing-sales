Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. is
opening a second showroom in Moscow, making the Russian capital
one of two cities in the world with more than one dealership for
the luxury cars.  Rolls-Royce CEO Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes will open the new
showroom in early July, the company said on its website.  Moscow has one of the highest concentrations of billionaire
residents in the world among its population of at least 11.6
million.  New York  also has two dealerships, and New Dehli will
gain a second soon, according to Rolls-Royce’s website.  Sales of Rolls-Royce cars doubled in Moscow last year to a
record from a year earlier, and have had a “healthy” increase
in the first half of 2012, the luxury-car maker said in the
statement, without giving numbers. The company received orders
for about 70 cars from clients in  Russia  in the last year,
Vedomosti reported today, citing an unidentified former employee
of Moscow’s first dealership. Musa Motors, owned by London-based
 Inchcape Plc (INCH) , runs the first showroom, and Avilon was authorized
for the second.  To contact the reporter on this story:
