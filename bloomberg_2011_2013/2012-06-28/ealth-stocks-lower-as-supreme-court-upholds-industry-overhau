U.S. health-care stocks remained
lower after the  Supreme Court  upheld President Barack Obama’s
overhaul of the industry.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Health Care Index dropped 0.4
percent at 10:10 a.m. in  New York  as Cigna Corp. and Pfizer Inc.
paced declines.  Trading in Community Health Systems Inc., Tenet Healthcare
Corp., WellPoint Inc. and HCA Holdings Inc. was paused by
circuit breakers meant to limit market volatility.  The health-care index had rallied 8 percent this year
through yesterday, outpacing the 5.9 percent gain in the overall
benchmark gauge of U.S. equities. The index includes 52
drugmakers, health insurers and other companies related to the
industry. Its largest stocks are Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc.
and Merck & Co., which collectively make up almost a third of
the index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  President  Barack Obama ’s plan was meant to extend coverage
to at least 30 million uninsured Americans in the biggest
overhaul of the nation’s health-care system since Medicare and
Medicaid were enacted in 1965.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
