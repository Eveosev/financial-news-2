Junichi Shimada, general manager of
the international business department at  Yakult Honsha Co. (2267) ,
comments on boosting sales in the U.S. in an interview June 27.  “There are offers from supermarkets in the U.S. about
selling Yakult products. If the sales increase at the current
pace, 200,000 products per day will be in sight.”  Yakult sold 125,000  milk products  per day in the U.S. in
2011, up 17 percent from a year earlier.  “There is a growing interest in the benefit of taking in
good bacteria in the U.S. The idea is infiltrating gradually.”  “Myanmar and Cambodia are attractive areas to enter in
Indochina. However, nothing has been decided at this point.”  Yakult will start to build a factory in  California  this
year, which begins production from 2013. Sales in the Americas
account for about 12 percent of total revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
