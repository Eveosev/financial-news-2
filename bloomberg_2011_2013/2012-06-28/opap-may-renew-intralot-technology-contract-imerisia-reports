Opap SA (OPAP) ,  Greece ’s biggest listed
gambling company, may renew Intralot SA’s contract to run its
technological support by as much as a year,  Imerisia  reported,
without saying how it got the information.  A delay in the completion of Opap’s tender for a provider
will force the company to proceed with monthly renewals of the
existing contract with Intralot starting in July, the Athens-
based newspaper said.  If a new company is chosen through the tender, it will take
at least six months to install its platform, Imerisia said.  Intralot and Gtech Holdings Corp SA are the two companies
that submitted bids. Intralot has been Opap’s technological
support provider for the last 12 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
