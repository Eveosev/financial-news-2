Chile ’s currency declined to a
three-week low after Germany’s unemployment rate increased and
European confidence fell, undermining demand for higher-yielding
assets in  emerging markets .  The peso fell 0.7 percent to 509.48 per dollar after
touching 510.63, its lowest level since June 6. It has declined
4.1 percent this quarter. The Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin American
Currency Index fell 0.5 percent.  The peso was the worst performer against the dollar among
major Latin America currencies tracked by Bloomberg on
speculation slowing global growth will curb demand for copper,
Chile’s main export. European Union leaders were divided on the
sovereign-debt crisis as they began a two-day summit.  “Given that the world is turning to a lower growth
environment, it’s difficult to see increased demand for metals
even with a positive outcome from the European summit,”  Diego Donadio , a strategist at BNP Paribas SA, said in a phone
interview from  Sao Paulo .  Futures on copper fell as much as 1.2 percent. Chile relies
on copper for half its exports.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
had a $9.9 billion bet against the currency on June 26, little
changed from May. Local investors had a $16.9 billion long peso
position.  To contact the reporter on this story:
