An explosion rocked a market in the
northeastern Kenyan town of Wajir near the border with Somalia,
a district official said.  The “very large” blast occurred today after waste at a
dump site in the market caught fire, District Officer John
Kihara said in a phone interview from the town, 500 kilometers
(311 miles) northeast of Nairobi, the capital. Five women were
treated for shock at the scene, Halima Hassan, a trader at the
market, said in a separate phone interview.  Police are investigating the explosion, which may have been
caused by a device left by people planning to target Kenyan army
troops traveling between a base in the town and the Somali
border, Kihara said.  Kenya’s military entered southern Somalia in October to
drive out al-Shabaab, the al-Qaeda-linked militant group that
has waged a five-year insurgency against the country’s United
Nations-backed transitional government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
