Brightpoint Inc. (CELL) , a distributor of
mobile devices for phone companies, rose the most in more than
16 months after announcing a servicing agreement with discount
wireless-provider FreedomPop.  Brightpoint  advanced  7.4 percent to $5.63 at 12:56 p.m. in
 New York , after earlier jumping 18 percent for the biggest
intraday gain since February 3, 2011. Shares of the
Indianapolis-based company had declined 51 percent this
year through yesterday.  The agreement lets Brightpoint handle inventory management,
logistic services and transportation management for closely held
FreedomPop, the companies said in a statement today. Financial
terms werenâ€™t disclosed.  FreedomPop, which is funded by Skype Technologies SA
founder Niklas Zennstrom, has said it plans to offer consumers
as much as 1 gigabyte of free wireless data connections this
year through a wholesale agreement with  Clearwire Corp. (CLWR)   CELL US <Equity> CN  NI CAB
