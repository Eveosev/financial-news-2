European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs CommissionerOlli Rehn said policy makers must have a
“serious debate” about proposals for common debt issuance
among the 17 euro-area countries.  “We need a serious debate in  Europe  about the mutualization
of public debt,” Rehn said today in an interview with Bloomberg
Television in Brussels. “We have to move toward deeper economic
integration, toward stronger economic governance so we minimize
the moral hazard and ensure fiscal rigor - then we can more
safely move toward further mutualization.”  “The basic principle is: no further mutualization of
public debt without deeper economic integration of decision-
making and control,” Rehn said.  Rehn said the  European Central Bank ’s longer-term
refinancing operation have helped liquidity in the banking
industry.  “We have avoided a credit crunch thanks to the LTRO, and
the recapitalization of the European banking sector is going on
in time,” Rehn said. “There is no reason to think there will
be major concern on liquidity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
