Italy’s inflation rate rose to 3.6
percent in June amid higher energy costs.  The  inflation  rate based on European Union measurements
rose to 3.6 percent from 3.5 percent in May, Rome-based national
statistics office Istat said in a preliminary report today. That
was more than the median forecast of 3.4 percent by 15
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Prices rose 0.2 percent
from May, Istat said.  Italian household confidence fell this month to a record
low as joblessness rose and Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s fiscal
measures deepened the country’s fourth economic recession since
2001.  Gasoline prices rose 16 percent from a year earlier, Istat
said today. They dropped 2.5 percent from a month ago.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said on June 15 that there are
“no inflation risks in any euro-area country.”  The ECB Governing Council discussed earlier this month
whether to lower its benchmark rate from 1 percent to support
 Europe ’s weakening economy. The next rate-setting meeting of the
Frankfurt-based institution is on July 5.  Based on  Italian methodology , Italian prices rose 0.2
percent in June from the previous month and 3.3 percent  from a
year earlier , Istat said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
