South African bonds gained, driving
yields to record lows, amid speculation the central bank will
cut  interest rates  as inflation slows and  Europe ’s debt crisis
threatens global economic growth. The rand advanced.  Yields on  South Africa ’s 6.75 percent bonds due 2021
dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.27
percent, the lowest since the securities were first issued in
2006. South Africa’s currency strengthened 0.3 percent to 8.4163
per dollar as of 2:32 p.m. in Johannesburg.  The cost of goods leaving factories and mines rose at 6.6
percent in May, the same pace as in April, Statistics South
Africa said. Consumer inflation slowed to 5.7 percent in May,
the agency said on June 20. European leaders are preparing to
meet in Brussels as they struggle to find a solution to the debt
crisis.  “With inflationary pressure easing, monetary policy will
probably remain accommodative, supporting a fragile local
economy given considerable downside risks emanating from a weak
Europe,” Dennis Dykes, chief economist at Nedbank Group Ltd.,
and colleagues wrote in e-mailed comments.  Central bank Governor Gill Marcus has left the benchmark
repurchase rate at 5.5 percent since November 2020. Forward-rate
agreements starting in December have dropped 27 basis points in
the past month to 5.25 percent, indicating traders see a
probability of a rate cut by the year-end.  Yields on South Africa’s $1 billion of 5.875 percent bonds
due 2022 dropped three basis points to 3.55 percent, the lowest
on record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
