Evraz Plc (EVR) , the largest steelmaker in
Russia by output, headed for the fourth-worst decline on the
FTSE 100 Index in London after  Alfa Bank  cut its recommendation
to the equivalent of sell, citing “high leverage.”  Evraz fell 4.4 percent to 238 pence by 4:08 p.m. in London.  The company’s “high” debt level places the stock in
“danger of underperformance,” Alfa analysts led by Barry Ehrlich, said in an e-mailed research note. Alfa cut the stock
to underweight, the equivalent of sell.  -- Editors: Alex Nicholson, Peter Branton  To contact the reporter on this story:
