Boralex Inc. (BLX) , a Canadian power
producer, bought four wind farms in France with a total of 90.5
megawatts of capacity.  Boralex paid C$45 million ($43.5 million) to the French
developer InnoVent SAS for three farms with 56 megawatts of
capacity that will be completed in the second half of 2013, the
Montreal-based company said today in a statement. It also bought
the 34.5-megawatt St-Patrick wind farm, which is already
producing electricity, from  AES Corp. (AES)  without giving a price.  The four projects are in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais and
Picardie regions of France. Boralex now has more than 500
megawatts of wind capacity in operation in Canada, the
Northeastern U.S. and France.  Boralex also may buy over the next five years 130 megawatts
of projects that InnoVent is developing in France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
