Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) 
President Koichi Miyata apologized to shareholders following the
arrest of a former brokerage unit executive suspected of insider
trading.  He made the apology in his opening remarks at the private
gathering, said investor Shinji Asai, who attended the event
today at the Tokyo headquarters of  Sumitomo Mitsui , Japan’s
second-biggest lender by market value. Kyosuke Hattori, a
company spokesman, confirmed the comments.  Miyata joins  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  Chief Executive Officer
Kenichi Watanabe in expressing regret to shareholders over their
firms’ roles in a regulatory crackdown on insider trading.
Miyata pledged to strengthen the Sumitomo Mitsui group’s
compliance in a bid to prevent such breaches, Hattori said.  Hiroyoshi Yoshioka, a former executive of SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc., a Sumitomo Mitsui unit, was arrested on June
25, becoming the first banker from a major brokerage to be
detained for suspected  insider trading  since 2008.  SMBC Nikko President Eiji Watanabe apologized at a news
conference on later that day, while adding that Yoshioka denies
involvement in insider trading while he was at the firm.  The brokerage has already been penalized separately for
leaking insider information. The Financial Services Agency
ordered SMBC Nikko in April to improve its business after 23
sales staff disclosed information to 34 clients before an
unidentified company’s announcement of an equity offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
