The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Mexico City trading. Stock symbols are
in parentheses, and prices are as of 12:26 p.m. local time.  The  IPC index  rose 0.4 percent to 39,634.43.  America Movil SAB (AMXL)  , the wireless carrier
controlled by the Mexican billionaire  Carlos Slim , rose 0.2
percent to 17.25 pesos. The company won the stake it sought in
 Royal KPN NV (KPN)  yesterday, increasing its influence in Europe
despite opposition from the Dutch company.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO)  , the largest cement maker in the
Americas, gained 2.3 percent to 8.78 pesos. The company is
trying to prevent a financing crunch in 2014 as a housing slump
in the U.S. and a deepening debt crisis in Europe erode sales.  Grupo Bimbo SAB (BIMBOA)  , the world’s largest
breadmaker, rose 2 percent to 32.19 pesos. Earlier this month
the company announced it would forgo takeovers through 2014
after 15 acquisitions over the past decade helped drive debt
relative to earnings to a two-year high.  Grupo Sports World SAB (SPORTS)  , a gym operator trading
on Mexico’s small-capitalization index, rose 3.8 percent to 14
pesos after climbing as much as 5.9 percent earlier in Mexico
City trading, the biggest intraday advance since Nov. 9. Sports
World’s board authorized an investment group yesterday to
purchase as much as 9.99 percent of the company’s shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
