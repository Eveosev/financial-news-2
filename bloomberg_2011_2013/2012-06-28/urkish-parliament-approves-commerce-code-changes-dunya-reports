Changes to  Turkey ’s commerce code
were approved by parliament and are due to take effect on July
1, Dunya reported.  Henceforth, shareholders who are relatives of company
directors will be able to borrow from companies under certain
conditions, the newspaper said. Draft legislation previously
discussed by the parliament would have meant board members’
relatives couldn’t owe companies money.  Companies won’t have to announce debts or cash holdings on
their websites under the new code; having to make such details
public was an aspect of the draft that business objected to,
Dunya said. Websites will be compulsory and must contain
information such as board members and capital increases, the
newspaper said.  The new code has to be approved by President  Abdullah Gul 
and be published in the Official Gazette before it takes effect,
the newspaper said.  Click here for web link   To contact the reporter on this story:
