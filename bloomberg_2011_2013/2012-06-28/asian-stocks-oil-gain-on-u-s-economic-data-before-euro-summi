U.S. equity futures fell after the
close of regular trading in New York and the dollar rose as
European leaders disagreed over the next steps to end the
sovereign-debt crisis.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  slid 0.4 percent
to 1,317.20 as of 7:21 p.m. in New York. The U.S. equity gauge
fell 0.2 percent during regular trading, paring a decline of as
much as 1.4 percent. The Dollar Index added 0.2 percent to
82.81. The euro was little changed at $1.2437.  European Union leaders struggled to meet demands by Spain
and  Italy  for relief from rising borrowing costs, threatening to
derail a 120 billion-euro ($149 billion) pledge to boost
economic growth. Italy is withholding its official endorsement
of the initiative as it pushes for collective action at an EU
summit in Brussels to push down its bond yields, said two
Italian officials who spoke on the condition that they not be
named.  The  S&P 500  retreated after a two-day, 1.4 percent advance.
Initial jobless claims were 386,000 last week and the prior
week’s reading was revised up to 392,000 from 387,000, matching
an April figure as the steepest of 2012. A Labor Department
report on June 1 showed American employers added the fewest jobs
in a year, sending the S&P 500 to a five-month low and 10-year
Treasury yields to a record low that day.  Regular Trading  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  slumped 2.5 percent before the 4 p.m.
close. The New York Times reported the lender’s losses from
 credit derivatives  may eventually total as much as $9 billion,
exceeding the firm’s initial estimate. Losses have increased in
recent weeks as JPMorgan sought to exit its holdings, the paper
reported, citing unidentified former traders and executives at
the bank.  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the largest maker of computer-
networking gear, slipped 1.5 percent after Lazard Ltd. said in a
note today that the company may be seeing weaker-than-expected
demand trends.  Indexes of technology, consumer and health-care companies
led declines among the  10 main industries  in the S&P 500. Energy
and telephone companies rose the most.  Commercial health insurers including WellPoint Inc. fell
after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld most of Obama’s health-care
legislation, while  Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC)  paced gains in
hospitals. Tenet, the third-biggest hospital chain, climbed 5.4
percent. WellPoint tumbled 5.2 percent.  Health Ruling  The court, voting 5-4, mostly left intact the Affordable
Care Act’s transformation of the health-care system, saying
Congress has the power to make Americans get insurance or pay a
penalty. The justices limited a plan to expand the Medicaid
system for the poor by about 16 million people.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell three basis
points to 1.58 percent, dropping for the second straight day, as
demand for refuge from  Europe ’s financial turmoil pushed rates
to a record low of 1.075 percent at a government auction of $29
billion in seven-year notes.  The dollar strengthened against 12 of 16 major peers.
Silver, oil, natural gas and gold lost at least 1.5 percent as
18 of 24 commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI Index retreated.
Corn halted a four-day rally sparked by concern a heat wave in
the U.S. Midwest will damage crops. Natural gas futures dropped
for the first time in six days after a government report showed
that U.S. stockpiles rose more than forecast last week.  European Stocks  The Stoxx 600 declined for the fifth time in six days as
banks and chemical companies led losses.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  plunged 16
percent after fines for falsifying London interbank-offered rate
submissions sparked speculation lawsuits will follow.
Commerzbank AG sank 7.2 percent as the lender issued new shares.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index fell 0.7 percent, its first
decline in three days. The Shanghai Composite Index sank 1
percent, erasing this year’s gains. Russia’s Micex Index slid
1.7 percent and  South Africa ’s benchmark gauge lost 1.5 percent.  The German 10-year bond yield declined five basis points to
1.51 percent, leaving the difference in yield between Europe’s
benchmark government security and the Spanish bond seven basis
points higher at 543 basis points, or 5.43 percentage points.  The number of Germans out of work rose a seasonally
adjusted 7,000 to 2.88 million, the Nuremberg-based Federal
Labor Agency said. Economists forecast an increase of 3,000, the
median of 30 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis will damp the German economy’s
performance this year, the Ifo economic research institute said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
