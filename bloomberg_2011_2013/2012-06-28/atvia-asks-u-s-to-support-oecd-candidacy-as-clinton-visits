Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis asked U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  for
support in the Baltic country’s bid to join the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.  Membership “would give  Latvia  the opportunity to more
successfully carry out the country’s economic interests in the
world and improve its international reputation,” Dombrovskis’s
office said today in an e-mailed statement, adding a request to
join the OECD has been submitted.  The Paris-based OECD, which has 34 members, admitted Baltic
neighbor  Estonia  in December 2010. Latvia’s economy, which
shrank by about a quarter in 2008-2009, when the government
passed spending cuts and increased taxes, expanded 6.9 percent
in the first quarter.  Dombrovskis has taken “very difficult decisions” in
“very difficult economic circumstances,” Clinton said today
during a visit to the capital, Riga.  To contact the reporter on this story:
