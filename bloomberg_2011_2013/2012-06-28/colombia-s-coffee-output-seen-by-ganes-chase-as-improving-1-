(Corrects measurement in first paragraph.)  Colombia ’s coffee  production  may be
9 million bags in the 2012-13 season, according to commodity
research company J. Ganes Consulting LLC.  The Andean nation’s coffee output has dropped from a peak
of 12.5 million bags in 2007-08 after damaging rains, according
to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . Roasters that switched to
other beans may not turn back to Colombia because they are more
flexible on their blends, Judy Ganes-Chase, president of
Katonah, New York-based J. Ganes said. Colombia also faces
falling domestic coffee consumption, she added.  “Colombia has not seen the success other producers have
seen in increasing domestic consumption,” she said at a
conference in Geneva today.  The country has “minimal stocks” and is likely to benefit
from a possible El Nino, a warming of the  Pacific Ocean  that
brings dry weather to some parts of the Andean nation, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
