The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission granted provisional registration to
 IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) ’s information database on energy,
interest-rate, credit and other swaps as the first swap-data
repository required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The approval of ICE Trade Vault LLC was announced by the
Washington-based agency in an e-mail statement today.  Dodd-Frank, the financial-regulation overhaul enacted in
2010, called for the databases to increase swaps market
transparency after largely unregulated trades helped fuel the
2008 credit crisis. The repositories are designed to collect
information about trading prices and volume in part to give
regulators a greater understanding of market moves.  “It’s a significant building block toward transparency in
these once-dark markets,” CFTC Chairman  Gary Gensler  said in a
telephone interview. “We have, I think, five applications in
front of us right now and we anticipate one or two more. But
this first one on rates, credit and energy will facilitate
market participants to comply with the already finished
transparency initiatives.”  Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange said it will
initially focus on commodity and energy markets, and then
evaluate opportunities for other types of derivatives.  “Global market participants will benefit from our
functionality and compliance tools, which will help them manage
new reporting requirements through a well-designed, cost-
efficient solution,” Bruce Tupper, president of ICE Trade
Vault, said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
