Anthera Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ANTH) 
declined the most in  New York  trading since its March 2010
initial public offering after saying its experimental lupus drug
didn’t meet the goal of a clinical test.  Anthera fell 67 percent to 91 cents at 9:56 a.m. New York
time, the biggest intraday drop since it first offered shares to
the public. The results of the mid-stage trial show the
medication, known as blisibimod, acted differently on patients
depending on the severity and type of their disease, meaning
additional studies will need to target a certain group of
patients, the Hayward, California-based company said in a
statement yesterday.  Anthera’s blisibimod trails  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ’s Benlysta,
which was approved in the U.S. last year as the first new drug
in 52 years for lupus, an autoimmune disease. Benlysta is the
main reason for Glaxo’s takeover bid for Human Genome Sciences
Inc., which helped develop the medicine and splits the sales and
profits with the London-based drugmaker.  “This is obviously very good news for Benlysta’s sales
potential,” said Jose Aymami, a  fund manager  at Merchbanc in
Barcelona who holds Human Genome shares.  The company said it plans to move blisibimod into the final
stage of clinical trials usually needed for regulatory approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
