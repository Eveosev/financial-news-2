South African producer prices rose
6.6 percent in May from a year earlier, more than economists
forecast, adding to pressure on the central bank to keep
 interest rates  unchanged.  The cost of goods leaving factories and mines rose at a the
same pace as in April, Pretoria-based Statistics  South Africa 
said on its website today. That was above the 6.3 percent median
estimate nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Prices gained
0.5 percent in the month.  The  Reserve Bank  has left its benchmark repurchase rate
unchanged at 5.5 percent since November 2010 to help support
 Africa ’s biggest economy while keeping price pressures in check.
Governor Gill Marcus said on June 8 the rand’s depreciation is
the main risk to inflation, making it difficult for the central
bank to lower borrowing costs as global growth slows.  “The risks emanate from a weaker  exchange rate , which
could see PPI pick up in the latter part of the year,” Shireen Darmalingam, an economist at Standard Bank Group Ltd. in
Johannesburg, said in an e-mailed note to clients. “We maintain
that interest rates will remain on hold through to the second
half of 2013.”  Consumer-price inflation slowed to 5.7 percent in May, near
the top of the bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent target range.  The rand dropped 8.8 percent against the dollar to 8.523 in
May, driving up producers’ costs of imported goods by 8.3
percent, the statistics agency said. The currency was at 8.42
against the dollar as of 1:15 p.m. in Johannesburg, little
changed from 8.4247 before the data was released. The yield on
the R157 bond due in 2015 fell 2 basis points to 6.01 percent.  Traders are increasing bets that the bank will cut rates by
the end of the year as inflation slows and the  European debt
crisis  curbs economic growth. The yield on the forward-rate
agreement due in December fell 27 basis points to 5.25 percent
in the past month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
