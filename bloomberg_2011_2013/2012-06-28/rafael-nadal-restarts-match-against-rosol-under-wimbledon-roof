Rafael Nadal  and Lukas Rosol of the
Czech Republic restarted their second-round match tied two sets
a piece at the Wimbledon tennis tournament after a 45-minute
delay as the roof was closed on Centre Court.  Nadal won the first set 7-6 (11-9), lost the next two 4-6
and 4-6 and pushed the match to a final set with a 6-2 fourth.
The roof was closed because of bad light in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
