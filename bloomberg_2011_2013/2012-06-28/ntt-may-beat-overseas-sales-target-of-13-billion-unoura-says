Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (9432) ,
 Japan ’s largest fixed-line phone company, will probably earn
more in overseas markets than it forecast at the beginning of
the fiscal year, President Hiroo Unoura said.  NTT may beat its estimate of generating $13 billion in
revenue outside Japan in the year started April 1, Unoura, who
took over as president this month, said in an interview today in
Tokyo where the company is based. “Our overseas affiliates have
started to make more cross-selling synergies.”  The telecom operator spent 1.7 billion pounds ($2.65
billion) to buy Dimension Data Holdings Plc, an U.K. computer
services company, in 2010 as it expanded overseas after the
Japanese market slowed. The company has announced 10 overseas
acquisitions totaling $3.02 billion in the past three years,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  NTT shares rose 1.5 percent to 3,700 yen at 2:18 p.m. in
 Tokyo  trading, paring their decline this year to 6 percent.  NTT’s businesses outside Japan “are making an operating
margin of 5 percent or more,” Unoura said. In November 2010, he
said their operating margin was “just about break-even.”  The company will consider more acquisitions outside Japan
to help it expand, the executive said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
