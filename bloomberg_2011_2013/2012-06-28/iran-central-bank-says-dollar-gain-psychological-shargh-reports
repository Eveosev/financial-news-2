Iran  Central Bank Governor Mahmoud Bahmani urged Iranians not be influenced by the psychological
atmosphere that has resulted in a recent increase in the
dollar’s value, Shargh reported.  Fluctuations in the market are mostly due to psychological
factors connected to political events and are not related to
changes in the supply and demand of the U.S. currency inside
Iran, Bahmani said, according to the Tehran-based newspaper.  The dollar’s value has risen this month, selling over the
past week for about 19,000 rials on the open market, the report
said. The dollar was sold on the open market for 19,210 rials
yesterday, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
