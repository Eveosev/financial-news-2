Russian Urals crude failed to trade
even after buyers raised bids for cargoes in both northwest
Europe and the Mediterranean. No public bids or offers were made
for  North Sea  Forties blend.  OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest oil producer, sold four
cargoes of 100,000 metric tons each of Urals for loading on July
10 to July 14 from the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk to BP Plc,
said three traders who participate in the market.  North Sea  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 35 cents a barrel less than
Dated Brent, compared with a discount of 48 cents yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for August settlement traded at $92.25 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $93.33 yesterday. The September contract was
at $92.31, a premium of 6 cents to August.  Norway’s first industrywide strike since 2004 entered a
fifth day, shutting down production of about 15 percent of the
crude supply from western  Europe ’s largest exporter.  The three unions involved in the action over pensions are
meeting tomorrow to discuss extending their walkout, said Leif
Sande, president of Industry Energy, biggest of the unions.
Prolonged disruptions in the past have typically prompted the
government to force unions and companies into arbitration.  The dispute is costing 201 million kroner ($33 million) a
day in lost revenue, according to the Norwegian Oil Industry
Association, which estimates the strike is crimping national oil
output by 240,000 barrels a day plus 11.9 million standard cubic
meters of natural gas. Statoil ASA, the country’s biggest energy
company, puts the daily loss at as much as 250,000 barrels.  Mediterranean/Urals  Petraco Oil Co. didn’t manage to buy 100,000 tons of Urals
for July 8 to July 12 at 55 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent
on a Rotterdam delivery basis, according to a Bloomberg survey
of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts trading window.
That’s up from yesterday’s trade at a 75-cent discount, which
was the smallest differential since Feb. 23.  Eni SpA tried without success to purchase a 140,000-ton
cargo of the blend for July 12 to July 16 delivery at $1.40 less
than Dated Brent delivered to Augusta,  Italy , the survey showed.
The grade last traded in the Mediterranean at a discount of
$1.60 on June 19.  Urals was at 72 cents less than Dated Brent in northwest
Europe, the highest since Feb. 23, compared with a discount of
$1.85 yesterday, Bloomberg data show.  TNK-BP sold 100,000 tons of the crude for loading on July
16 to July 17 from Ust-Luga to Glencore International Plc, two
traders who participate in the market said.  West Africa  Vitol Group wasn’t able to sell 800,000 barrels of  Gabon ’s
Oguendjo crude at a 20-cent premium to Dated Brent for July 15
to July 20 delivery to Rotterdam or the French port of Lavera.  PT Pertamina bought two 1 million-barrel cargoes of West
African crude for loading in August via a tender, according to
three traders involved in the region’s market.  The company bought one cargo of Angolan Girassol from BP
Plc, and one shipment of Nigerian Bonga from Trafigura Beheer
BV, said the people who declined to be identified because the
information is confidential.  Nigeria plans to export four cargoes of Erha grade in
August, unchanged from July, according to a loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News. Each shipment is for 997,500 to 1
million barrels.  Bharat Petroleum Corp. issued a tender to buy crude for
loading from Aug. 21 to Aug. 31, according to a document
obtained by Bloomberg News. The tender closes on July 3 at 3
p.m. local time, with offers valid until 7 p.m. the following
day, the document showed.  Qua Iboe was at $1.30 a barrel more than Dated Brent, the
lowest since Oct. 27, 2010, compared with a premium of $1.33
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
