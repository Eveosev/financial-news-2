Nike Inc. (NKE)  tumbled the most in more
than three years after fourth-quarter profit unexpectedly
declined for the first time since 2009 as marketing costs
increased and sales growth slowed.  Nike, the world’s largest sporting-goods company, fell 9.4
percent to $87.78 at the close in  New York  for the largest
decline since Dec. 1, 2008. The stock had  gained  0.5 percent
this year through yesterday.  Net income in the quarter ended May 31 declined 7.6 percent
to $549 million, or $1.17 a share, Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike
said yesterday in a statement. That’s the first drop since the
November 2009 quarter. Analysts projected $1.37 a share, the
average of 20 estimates. Profit had topped analysts’
expectations in 22 of the past 23 quarters.  Chief Executive Officer  Mark Parker  responded to higher
costs by introducing widespread price increases in January to
improve Nike’s gross profit margin, which narrowed for the sixth
straight quarter. The company’s sales also slowed in  Europe ,
where it generates about a quarter of its revenue, as recession
and government cuts curbed  consumer spending .  “We would not be buyers of the stock” because of concerns
sales growth will slow and the risk that Nike will be left with
a glut of inventory after the Olympics, Camilo Lyon, an analyst
for Canaccord Genuity Corp. in New York, wrote in a note to
clients today. He lowered his 12-month price estimate on the
shares to $92 from $104.  Marketing Spending  Nike’s profit fell as sales gained 12 percent to $6.47
billion, short of analysts’ projections of $6.51 billion. While
revenue from  China  rose 18 percent to $667 million, Nike expects
growth to moderate and said it has too much inventory in the
region. Sales from that area increased 25 percent in the
previous quarter.  Orders for the Nike brand from June to November, excluding
currency exchange-rate changes, advanced 12 percent. Analysts
projected a gain of 16 percent, the average of eight estimates.
Orders for March to July rose 18 percent. Orders from China
increased 2 percent, following a 20 percent gain in the previous
period.  A $24 million charge related to restructuring its business
in western Europe, higher  tax rate , discounting and increased
marketing during the quarter reduced earnings, the company said.  Nike increased spending on marketing by 23 percent to $760
million to support product releases tied to the European
football championships and the Olympics.  Gross margin, or the percentage of sales left after the
cost of goods sold, narrowed 1.5 percentage points from a year
earlier to 42.8 percent.  Cole Haan Losses  The Umbro and Cole Haan units, which Nike plans to sell,
had a combined loss of $43 million before interest and taxes in
fiscal 2012 and would lose as much as $75 million if owned for
all of fiscal 2013, the company said.  “With Nike, we are often used to things coming in better
than expected,”  Paul Swinand , an analyst for  Morningstar Inc. (MORN) 
in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “In this case,
almost every line item came in a little worse than expected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
