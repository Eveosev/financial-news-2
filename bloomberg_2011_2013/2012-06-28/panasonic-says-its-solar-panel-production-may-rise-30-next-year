Panasonic Corp. (6752)  may boost its
production of solar panels by about 30 percent next fiscal year
because of incentives from  Japan ’s government, the head of the
business said.  Japan’s so-called feed-in-tariff prices, set June 18,
“have boosted the interest of individuals and business owners
in using their rooftops or unused fields for solar-power
generation,” Kazuhiro Yoshida, who heads the Osaka-based
company’s solar business, said in an interview yesterday.  Panasonic may boost its panel production to as much as 800
megawatts in the fiscal year ending March 2014 from an estimated
600 megawatts this fiscal year, Yoshida said.  The company and rival panel makers including  Sharp Corp. (6753) 
and  Kyocera Corp. (6971)  stand to benefit as the program starts next
month. Utilities will pay 42 yen (53 cents) a kilowatt-hour for
20 years to solar-power producers, almost twice the rate in
 Germany , the world’s biggest market by panel installations.
Panasonic is increasing its focus on solar energy after posting
a record  loss  of 772 billion yen last fiscal year as the yen
gained and prices for its televisions fell.  The maker of HIT panels is increasing its production
capacity of solar cells to 900 megawatts by the end of next
fiscal year from 600 megawatts currently by opening a new plant
in  Malaysia  in December. Panasonic is sticking with a 2010 plan
to boost production capacity to 1.5 gigawatts by March 2016,
Yoshida said.  Solar-product sales in Japan will probably climb to 80
percent of revenue at the renewable energy business this fiscal
year from 67 percent in the 12 months ended March 31, Yoshida
said earlier this month. The company expects to keep margins for
the solar business at about 10 percent this year, he said June
19.  To contact the reporters on this story:
