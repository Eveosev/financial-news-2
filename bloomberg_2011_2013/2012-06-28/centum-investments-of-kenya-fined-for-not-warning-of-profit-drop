Centum Investment Co. (CENTUM) , Kenya’s
largest publicly traded investment group, was fined by the East
African country’s  Capital Markets Authority  for not issuing a
warning before reporting a 48 percent drop in annual profit.  An official at the regulator, who asked not to be
identified because he isn’t authorized to speak to the media,
wouldn’t say how big the penalty is.  Centum’s net income in the 12 months through March fell to
1.19 billion shillings ($14 million) and investment income
declined by a similar amount, the company said June 19. Chief
Executive Officer James Mworia wasn’t available for comment when
Bloomberg called his office three times today.  Listed companies must inform the Nairobi Securities
Exchange, the public and the regulator at least 24 hours before
releasing full-year results that are expected to fall by more
than 25 percent, according to the Capital Markets Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
