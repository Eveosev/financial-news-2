Cotton-growing areas in  Texas , the
largest U.S. producer, will have dry weather during the next two
weeks, reducing moisture for crops across the region, according
to Commodity Weather Group.  “It’s probably too soon to say that the dry weather is
going to have an impact on the crop,” David Streit, an
agricultural meteorologist with the Bethesda, Maryland-based
forecaster, said in a telephone interview. “For non-irrigated
areas, they will start to see some moisture shortages.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
