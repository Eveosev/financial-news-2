PT Garda Tujuh Buana plans to
increase coal production by 67 percent next year in response to
demand from  India .  The company wants to produce 5 million metric tons of coal
in 2013 compared with a planned 3 million tons this year, Shael
Oswal, the president director of the Indonesian mining company,
said in an interview yesterday. The miner exports all its coal
to India, he said.  “A lot of power plants in India will be coming in the next
five years and they require low-calorific value coal,” Oswal
said. “For India, Indonesia is the best place to import because
it’s near.”  India’s demand for seaborne thermal coal may rise to 400
million tons by 2030 from 80 million last year, Wood Mackenzie
Ltd., an Edinburgh, U.K.-based consultant, said in a report
March 14.  Garda Tujuh (GTBO)  sells 80 percent of its power-station coal
under a long-term contract with fixed prices, Oswal said. The
remaining 20 percent is sold on  spot market .  Thermal coal at the Australian port of Newcastle, the
benchmark price for  Asia , cost $83.10 a ton as of June 22, down
20 percent this quarter, according to IHS McCloskey, a coal-data
provider. That would be the biggest quarterly slump since the
first three months of 2009.  Acquisition  The company is seeking to buy mines that produce coal with
a heating value between 5,800 to 6,000 kilocalories a kilogram
that’s used in  steel mills , Oswal said. Garda Tujuh’s mine in
East Kalimantan on the island of  Borneo  produces low-heating
value coal of between 4,800 to 5,100 kilocalories a kilogram,
according to the company’s 2011 annual report.  Garda Tujuh has $50 million that it could use to buy a mine
should an opportunity arise, Pardeep Dhir, a commissioner at the
company, said in a phone interview. It plans $10 million in
capital expenditure this year to buy new mining equipment, Dhir
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
