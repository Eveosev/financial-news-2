Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  said it
will resume production tomorrow at its No. 2 naphtha cracker at
Mailiao, Taiwan.  Formosa, which shut the unit on June 20 because of a  power
failure , plans to feed naphtha into the plant on June 29 and
expects chemical products to come out by tomorrow evening,
President Tsao Mihn said by telephone from Taipei. The cracker
resumed mechanical operations on June 26, he said.  Taiwanâ€™s only publicly traded refiner plans to start the
halted No. 3 naphtha cracker in early July, Tsao said.  Formosa Plastics (1301)  Group, the parent company of the refiner,
expects sales to fall by NT$9 billion ($301 million) after it
was forced to shut 42 of 66 plants at the Mailiao production
site because of the  power outage , the group said June 21.  Benchmark prices of naphtha in Asia traded at a premium of
$47.32 a metric ton to Brent crude futures today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg News. The premium has more than
doubled from $21.94 a ton on June 26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
