About a third of  Iran ’s tea
factories have shut down because of a lack of support from the
government,  Shargh  reported, citing Parviz Shabani, vice
president of Iran’s union of tea producers.  Half of Iran’s tea farmers have become unemployed
since the start of the Iranian year on March 20, Shabani said,
according to the Tehran-based daily. Iran’s government has
failed to pay some of the money it owes to the farmers, he said,
without elaborating on the amount or the reason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
