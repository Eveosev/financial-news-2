Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble 
didn’t say  Germany  will move sooner than expected toward euro
bonds with shared liability for debt, a Finance Ministry
spokesman in Berlin said today.  Schaeuble’s comments, which had been cited in a Wall Street
Journal interview, reiterated the German position that debt
mutualization is conceivable at the end of a European
integration process, the spokesman said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.  “Nothing in the German position has changed,” Martin Kotthaus, Schaeuble’s chief spokesman, said according to an e-
mailed statement. “At the end of a development toward a true
and stable fiscal union, one can talk about joint debt
management. But only then.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
