Kenya’s shilling weakened for a
third time this week as dollar demand by importers to meet
month-end obligations outweighed efforts by the central bank to
curb  money supply .  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy depreciated
as much as 0.6 percent to 84.55 per dollar and was trading 0.4
percent lower to 84.35 by 2:53 p.m., in Nairobi, the capital.  “The shilling is expected to remain under pressure as
importers buy dollars to meet their end-month obligations,”
Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) , said in a note to clients.  Kenya accepted 3.45 billion shillings ($41 million) of bids
for  repurchase agreements  maturing in seven days at a weighted
average rate of 17.638 percent, said a central bank official,
who asked not to be identified in line with policy.  The bank also accepted 1.55 billion shillings of bids for
28-day term auction deposits at a rate of 17.768 percent, the
official said. The bank, which had offered 5 billion shillings
in total, received bids 13.3 of billion shillings for both
sales.  Tanzania’s shilling gained 0.3 percent to 1,576 per dollar,
while  Uganda ’s shilling remained unchanged at 2,470 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
