The 100 largest public pension plans
earned $179.2 billion on investments in the first quarter, the
most since the U.S. Census Bureau began collecting the data in
1974.  Total holdings and investments rose 5.6 percent in the
quarter to $2.8 trillion, the second-highest level since U.S.
equities markets collapsed in 2008 amid the worst recession
since the 1930s, the census said in a  report  today.  Stocks increased 17.6 percent in the quarter to $967.2
billion, the report said, as corporate bonds fell 6.9 percent to
$371.9 billion. International securities climbed 16.3 percent to
$550 billion.  U.S. public pension funds have been struggling to restore
funding levels since the recession left many with fewer assets
to pay future benefits to retirees. States by 2010 had 74.6
percent of the assets needed to pay pension obligations, down
from  82.8 percent in 2007, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
