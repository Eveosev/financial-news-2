Australian sales of newly built
homes slowed in May as interest-rate reductions failed to make
an immediate impact on the nation’s property market, a private
report showed.  Sales rose 0.7 percent last month to 5,855 from April, when
they jumped 6.9 percent, the Canberra-based Housing Industry
Association said, citing a survey of the nation’s 100 largest
builders. Detached house sales dropped 2 percent, while
apartments soared by 21.1 percent, it said.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia cut the benchmark rate by 50
basis points late last year and a further 75 points in the past
two meetings as inflation remained contained and the savings
rate stayed above 9 percent. At 3.5 percent, the overnight cash
rate target is still the highest among major developed
economies.  “The impact of interest rate cuts at the end of 2011,
together with the announcement of a 50 basis point cut to the
official cash rate on May 1 this year, has so far done little to
spur new home sales, given the soft outcomes evident for
detached houses,”  Harley Dale , HIA chief economist, said in a
statement.  Australian  house prices  declined in the three months
through March in the longest losing streak in at least a decade.
An index measuring prices for established houses in eight major
cities dropped 1.1 percent last quarter from the previous three
months, when it fell a revised 0.7 percent, the  Australian
Bureau of Statistics  said in a May 1 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
