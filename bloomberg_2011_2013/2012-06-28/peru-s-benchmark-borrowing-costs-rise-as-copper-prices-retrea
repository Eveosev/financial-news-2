Peru’s benchmark borrowing costs in
dollars rose for a second day as prices for the country’s top
exports, copper and gold, dropped on signs of slowing growth in
the U.S. and Europe.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries increased one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 182 basis points at 2:57 p.m. in Lima,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  German unemployment rose more than economists forecast
while in the U.S. applications for jobless benefits hovered last
week near the highest level of the year.  China  is the world’s
biggest copper consumer followed by the U.S. and Germany. Metals
account for two-thirds of Peru’s exports.  “Commodity prices are falling as the global outlook is
less clear,” said Augusto Saldarriaga, the head of analysis at
Banco Internacional del Peru.  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.6650 per  U.S. dollar  from
2.6675 yesterday, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank didn’t  buy or sell dollars  in the  spot market 
today.  Peruvian banks’ net dollar holdings declined to $277
million on June 26 from $364 million a week earlier, according
to central bank data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
