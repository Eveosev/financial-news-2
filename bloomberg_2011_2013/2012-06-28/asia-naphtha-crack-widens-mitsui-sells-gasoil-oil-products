Refiners’ profits from naphtha rose
to the highest level in almost a month. Mitsui & Co. and
Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. sold gasoil in Singapore.  Light Distillates  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures widened $18.83, or 70 percent, to $45.90 a metric ton at
6:19 p.m. Singapore time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This crack spread is the widest since May 31.  Mabanaft GmbH sold 25,000 tons of  open-specification
naphtha  for delivery in the second half of August to Glencore
International AG at $745 a ton, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of traders who monitored the Platts window.  Gunvor Group Ltd. sold 50,000 barrels of 95-RON gasoline,
loading July 18 to July 22 to Gracewood International Ltd. at
$100.10 a barrel.  Middle Distillates  Mitsui sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 10 parts per
million of sulfur to BP Plc at a premium of $3.80 a barrel to
benchmark prices published between July 12 and July 18, the
survey of traders showed. The cargo was for loading July 13 to
July 17.  Brightoil sold a similar-sized cargo of gasoil with 0.5
percent sulfur to Total SA at a premium of 10 cents to benchmark
prices between July 18 and July 24.  Singapore  gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude rose 59 cents, or
3.9 percent, to $15.74 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. The
spread is the widest in a week.  Fuel Oil  China International United Petroleum & Chemical Co., or
Unipec, sold two 20,000-ton, 380-centistoke fuel oil cargoes to
Hin Leong Trading Pte and PetroChina Co., the Bloomberg survey
showed. The first cargo, for July 18 to July 22 loading, was
sold at a premium of $3 a ton over the benchmark quotes, and the
second, for July 23 to July 27 loading, was at a premium of
$4.25 a ton. Lukoil OAO sold a 40,000-ton similar grade cargo to
Royal Dutch Shell Plc at a premium of $4.75 a ton over the
benchmark price, and the cargo is for July 14 to July 18 loading.  Fuel oil  in Singapore traded a premium of 5 cents a barrel
to benchmark Dubai crude. This  crack  spread was at a discount of
66 cents yesterday, according to Bloomberg. This shows refiners
are making a profit from processing crude into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , rose 50 cents to $11.25 a ton,
according to Bloomberg data. This shows marine fuel gained less
compared with fuel oil used in power stations.  Tenders  Oil & Natural Gas Corp.,  India ’s largest state-owned oil
explorer, offered to sell a naphtha cargo for loading in July
from Hazira, according to a document sent to potential buyers.  Refinery News  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. said it will resume production
tomorrow at its No. 2 naphtha cracker at Mailiao,  Taiwan . The
company, which shut the unit on June 20 because of a  power
failure , plans to feed naphtha into the plant on June 29 and
expects chemical products to come out by tomorrow evening,
President Tsao Mihn said by telephone from Taipei. The cracker
resumed mechanical operations on June 26, he said.  Taiwan’s only publicly traded refiner plans to start the
halted No. 3 naphtha cracker in early July, Tsao said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
