Taiwan ’s dollar touched a one-week
high on speculation exporters are repatriating income before the
end of the month.  Government bonds  were steady.  The currency closed little changed at NT$29.956 against its
U.S. counterpart, and rose to NT$29.82 earlier, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It has dropped 1.4 percent this quarter and
reached NT$30.070 on June 5, the weakest level since Jan. 17.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, declined 11 basis points to 4.19 percent.  “Companies are bringing money back since it’s the end of
the month,” said Tarsicio Tong, a currency trader at Union Bank
of Taiwan in Taipei. “Investors are also slowing down a bit
after the wave of sell-offs in recent weeks.”  Stock indexes  rose across  Asia  for a second day after
official data showed orders for U.S. durable goods and contracts
to buy existing homes rebounded in May. Foreign funds have sold
$999 million more of the island’s stocks than they bought this
month, exchange data show, as  Europe ’s worsening debt crisis
deterred risk-taking.  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 was
1.214 percent, compared with 1.209 percent yesterday, according
to Gretai Securities Market. The  benchmark  10-year yield fell
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, this quarter.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.513
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
