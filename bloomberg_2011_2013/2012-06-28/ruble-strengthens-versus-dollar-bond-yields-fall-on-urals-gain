The ruble depreciated against the
dollar for a second day and yields on  Russia ’s local debt rose
as oil, the country’s main export, declined.  The Russian currency weakened 0.4 percent to 33.13 per
dollar by the close in Moscow. The country’s 28 billion rubles
($845 million) of local OFZ bonds due 2027 declined, raising the
yield by one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.9
percent.  Brent crude  slipped 1.7 percent to $91.86 per barrel before
a European-Union summit in Brussels to discuss the region’s debt
crisis. Oil and gas together contribute about 50 percent of
Russia’s state revenue, according to government estimates.  “Oil is off, and that’s the main driver in the short term
for the ruble,” Hans Gustafson, an emerging-markets strategist
at  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  in  Stockholm , said by e-mail.  The ruble lost 0.2 percent to 41.18 per euro and was little
changed at 36.7525 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket. Investors increased bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 33.6659 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 33.533 per dollar
yesterday.  The ruble may weaken 2 percent to 33.80 per dollar next
week after the end of the monthly tax period, according to Vadim Kuchinskiy, a London-based currency trader at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc. Exporters convert revenue from abroad in the
second half of every month to pay the government, boosting the
Russian currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
