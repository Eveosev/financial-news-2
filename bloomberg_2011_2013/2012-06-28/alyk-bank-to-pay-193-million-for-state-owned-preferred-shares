Halyk Savings Bank (HSBK) , the lender
controlled by Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev ’s daughter
and son-in-law, will pay 28.8 billion tenge ($193 million) for
its preferred shares owned by the state.  Halyk Bank, the second-largest Kazakh lender by assets,
will buy 160 million shares for 179.94 tenge apiece from
sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna today and tomorrow, the
Almaty-based lender said in a statement to the Kazakhstan stock
exchange. Halyk didn’t elaborate on the transaction.  Samruk-Kazyna bought stakes in Halyk and  Kazkommertsbank (KKB)  in
early 2009 and took control of BTA Bank, Kazakhstan’s largest
lender at the time, after credit markets froze and the country’s
property bubble burst.  To contact the reporter on this story:
