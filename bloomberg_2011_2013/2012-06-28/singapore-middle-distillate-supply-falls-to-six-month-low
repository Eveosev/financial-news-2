Middle-distillate stockpiles in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s biggest oil-trading, refining and storage
center, dropped to the lowest level in more than six months,
according to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Inventories of gasoil and kerosene shrank by 682,000
barrels, or 7.6 percent, to 8.26 million in the seven days ended
yesterday, International Enterprise Singapore said in an e-
mailed statement today. That’s the least since the week ended
Dec. 21.  Light-distillate supplies, including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate, declined by 263,000 barrels, or 2.3 percent, to 10.98
million, according to the data.  Residual-fuel stockpiles, including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen, increased for the first time
in four weeks. Supplies gained 1.39 million barrels, or 7.2
percent, to 20.63 million, the highest level in more than two
months.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
