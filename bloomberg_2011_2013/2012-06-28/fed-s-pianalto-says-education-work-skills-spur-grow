Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland
President  Sandra Pianalto  said boosting U.S. living standards
depends on Americans gaining a solid education and strong work
skills, as well as access to credit and housing.  “Communities and regions will not see their living
standards rise without having an ample share of residents who
have good educations and strong workforce skills,” Pianalto
said today in a speech in Cleveland. “Affordable housing and
fair access to credit, as important as they are, are simply not
sufficient to ensure strong communities.”  In an effort to cut borrowing costs such as  mortgage rates ,
policy makers led by Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  decided at a
June 19-20 meeting to extend a program known as Operation Twist,
replacing $267 billion in short-term bonds with longer-term debt
through the end of 2012. They also lowered their outlook for
growth and employment.  Small-business lending, financial literacy, homebuyer
education and other issues under Fed purview “will not be
easily addressed” by the central bank, Pianalto said at the
regional bank’s 2012 policy summit on housing. She didn’t
discuss monetary policy.  Pianalto, 57, votes this year on the policy-setting  Federal
Open Market Committee  this year. She has been president of the
Cleveland Fed since 2003. She first joined the regional bank in
1983 as an economist in the research department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
