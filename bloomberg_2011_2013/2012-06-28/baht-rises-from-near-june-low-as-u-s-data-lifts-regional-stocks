Thailand ’s baht rose from near this
month’s low and regional equities advanced after reports showed
U.S. home sales and durable goods orders climbed more than
estimated.  Government bonds  climbed.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index gained for a third
day and the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of stocks rose the most
since June 18 before European Union leaders start a two-day
summit in Brussels today to discuss the region’s debt crisis.
Thailand said this week exports increased 7.68 percent in May,
compared with a 3.67 percent decline in April. The U.S. is the
world’s biggest economy and accounted for 10 percent of Thai
shipments in the first five months of this year.  “With the good data out of the U.S. and gains in stocks,
risk sentiment is quite stable,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a Bangkok-
based trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. “Currencies are
likely to be quite range-bound before the results of the
European summit are coming out.”  The baht rose 0.03 percent to 31.87 per dollar as of 8:30
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 31.96 on June 25, the weakest level since May
31. Its one-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was little changed at 4.52
percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 declined
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.34 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. orders for durable goods rose 1.1 percent in May, more
than the 0.5 percent increase predicted in a Bloomberg survey,
according to a Commerce Department report yesterday. The
National Association of Realtors said pending home sales climbed
5.9 percent, compared with a 1.5 percent gain forecast in a
separate poll of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
