Sameh Fahmy,  Egypt ’s oil minister
under the rule of ousted President  Hosni Mubarak , was sentenced
to 15 years in prison on charges related to gas exports to
 Israel , a Cairo criminal court said in a faxed statement today.  Businessman Hussein Salem was also sentenced to 15 years in
jail on the same charges of selling gas to Israel at below-
market prices, costing Egypt $715 million, according to the
court’s statement.  Opponents of Mubarak’s administration criticised the gas
deal before he was pushed from power in February 2011. Several
lawsuits were filed against the supply deal and the government
had said it was reviewing the terms of the contracts. It was
subsequently scrapped by Egypt in April.  Salem, a close associate of Mubarak, was sentenced in
absentia, while Fahmy is among the Mubarak-era ministers who
have already been imprisoned. The two men, along with six other
senior oil executives, were fined about $2.3 billion, according
to the court. The others were sentenced to between three and 10
years in prison.  To contact the reporter on this story:
