Georgia  was sued by the U.S.  Justice
Department  over claims its voting procedures don’t adequately
ensure that eligible military and overseas voters can
participate fully in the state’s August federal primary runoff
election.  The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Atlanta, was brought
under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act,
the Justice Department said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  The U.S. seeks a court order requiring Georgia to take all
steps required to guarantee that citizens covered by the act can
participate in the Aug. 21 election and all future federal
elections, according to the statement.  The suit seeks to “ensure that Georgia’s military and
overseas voters, many of whom are members of our armed forces
and their families serving our country around the world, will be
provided the opportunity” to vote, Thomas E. Perez, Assistant
Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, said in the
statement.  Georgia and its secretary of state, Brian P. Kemp., are
named as defendants in the lawsuits. The filing couldn’t be
immediately confirmed from court records yesterday.  Tim Fleming, a spokesman for Kemp, didn’t immediately
return a call after regular business hours yesterday seeking
comment on the lawsuit. A representative of Georgia Governor
Nathan Deal didn’t immediately return an e-mail seeking comment.  The case is U.S. v. The State of Georgia, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta).  To contact the reporter on this story:
