China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) ,
the world’s second worst-performing stocks measure this month,
erased this year’s gain on concern a manufacturing slump and the
 European debt crisis  will deepen the economic slowdown.  The Shanghai index dropped 1 percent to 2,195.84 at the
close, a seventh day of losses. The gauge has lost 7.4 percent
in June. The measure had gained as much as 12 percent this year
through its peak on March 2. Trading values on the Shanghai
Stock Exchange fell to a five-month low yesterday.  “The economy is still slowing and earnings growth
forecasts have further room to be revised downward,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co.,
which oversees $285 million. “Weak sentiment will dominate as
investors have no idea how slow earnings growth will be.”  Dongfang Electric Corp. (600875)  paced a decline for industrial
companies on concern slowing growth will sap demand.  Economic data this weekend may show China’s manufacturing
is contracting. The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index compiled by the
statistics bureau and logistics federation may drop to 49.8 this
month, falling below the dividing line of 50 for expansion and
contraction, according to the median estimate of 19 economists
in a Bloomberg survey. The figure is due July 1.  Dongfang Electric, China’s second-biggest maker of power
equipment, tumbled 9.3 percent to 17.63  yuan , the biggest
decline this year. Shanghai Electric Group Co., the nation’s
biggest, lost 4.6 percent to 4.61 yuan.  Concern that Greece may exit the euro has prolonged
Europe’s debt crisis and hurt the outlook for China’s exports to
its biggest trading partner.  Growth Target  China’s economy  expanded 8.1 percent in the first quarter,
the slowest pace in almost three years. Growth may be below 7
percent in the second quarter if this month’s data doesn’t
improve, the People’s Daily reported on June 13. Premier  Wen
Jiabao  announced on March 5 an economic growth target of 7.5
percent for this year, down from an 8 percent goal in place
since 2005.  The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  slipped 0.9 percent to 2,425.73. The
 Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded
U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added 1.1 percent in New York
yesterday.  Stocks on the Shanghai Composite are valued at 9.59 times
estimated earnings, compared with the average of 17.6 since
Bloomberg began compiling the  data  in 2006. Thirty-day
 volatility  in the gauge was at 15.08 today, compared with this
year’s average of 18.32. About 5.1 billion shares changed hands
in the  Shanghai Stock Exchange  yesterday, 41 percent lower than
the daily average this year.  Rare Earths  Investors are opening the fewest accounts to trade equities
on record on a 30-day average basis, according to weekly  data 
compiled by Bloomberg that goes back to August 2007.  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co., China’s
biggest producer of rare earth, declined 5.5 percent to 37.95
yuan. The European Union requested the creation of a dispute-
settlement panel at the WTO on China’s export restrictions on
rare earths, tungsten and molybdenum. China, which supplies 90
percent of the world’s rare earth, has said it curbed exports of
rare earths to conserve minerals and protect environment.  Gansu Qilianshan Cement Group Co. (600720)  slid 2 percent to 10.49
yuan after it said first-half profit may drop more than 50
percent from a year earlier. China Resources Cement, a Hong
Kong-listed producer, slumped 6.2 percent after saying yesterday
it expects interim profit to fall “significantly.”  “The biggest negative right now for Chinese stocks is that
earnings are being cut,”  Steven Bell , who manages $600 million
in assets as principal portfolio manager at the GLC Ltd., a
London-based hedge fund, said by phone yesterday.  --Zhang Shidong. With assistance from Weiyi Lim in Singapore.
