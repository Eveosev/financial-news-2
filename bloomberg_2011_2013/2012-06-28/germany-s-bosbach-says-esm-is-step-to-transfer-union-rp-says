Wolfgang Bosbach , chairman of the
domestic affairs committee in Germany’s lower house of
Parliament, or Bundestag, said the permanent rescue mechanism is
a step toward a European transfer union,  Rheinische Post 
reported, citing an interview.  “I cannot agree to the ESM as Germany would again take on
giant liability risks, this time amounting to another 190
billion euros,” Bosbach was quoted as saying in an e-mailed
preview of an article to appear in the June 29 edition of the
paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
