The U.S. Treasury Department
announced proceeds of $204 million from a public offering of
preferred stock it holds in seven banks as part of the Troubled
Asset Relief Program.  The Treasury said in a statement today that it received a
profit from an auction of its stock positions in  Fidelity
Southern Corp. (LION)  of Atlanta; Firstbank Corp. of Alma, Michigan;
 First Citizens Banc Corp. (FCZA)  of Sandusky,  Ohio ;  MetroCorp
Bancshares Inc. (MCBI)  of Houston; Peoples Bancorp of  North Carolina 
Inc. of Newton, North Carolina; Pulaski Financial Corp. of  St.
Louis ; and  Southern First Bancshares Inc. (SFST)  of Greenville, South
Carolina.  Under TARP, originally approved by Congress in 2008 as a
$700 billion dollar program to rescue financial institutions,
the Treasury put cash into banks in exchange for equity stakes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
