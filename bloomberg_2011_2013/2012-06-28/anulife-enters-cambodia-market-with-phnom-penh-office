Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , Canada’s
largest insurer, has opened an office in Phnom Penh, Cambodia,
its first in the Southeast Asian nation.  Manulife has about 40 people in its Cambodian unit, the
Toronto-based insurer said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer Donald Guloien, 55, has said
expansion in  Asia  is part of Manulife’s plan to reach C$4
billion ($3.9 billion) in net income by 2015. Manulife, owner of
Boston-based John Hancock Financial, operates in  Hong Kong  and
countries including China, Malaysia, Vietnam and Japan.  The insurer offers Cambodian clients basic term insurance
and is working with regulators to sell other products, David
Wong, chairman of Manulife Cambodia, said today in a phone
interview. The unit has been working with regulators since early
2011 to win approval to operate there, he said.  “We see an emerging middle class here,” Wong said.
“These are people starting families with steady jobs, fairly
good jobs, where the average age is 25.”  Manulife  fell  7 cents to C$10.77 in Toronto. The shares
have dropped 0.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
