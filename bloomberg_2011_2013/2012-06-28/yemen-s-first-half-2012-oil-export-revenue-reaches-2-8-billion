Yemen’s crude oil and gas exports
reached $2.8 billion in the first half of 2012, state news
agency Saba reported, citing an unnamed official at the Central
Bank of Yemen.  Oil revenue increased Yemen’s foreign-currency reserves to
$4.75 billion at the end of June from $4.5 billion at the
beginning of this year, Saba said.  Yemen’s foreign reserves will probably rise in the second
half of the year, partly due to greater political stability,
said Saba, citing the official.  To contact the reporters on this story:
