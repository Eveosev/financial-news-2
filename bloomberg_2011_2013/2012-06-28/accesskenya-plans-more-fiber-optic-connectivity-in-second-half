AccessKenya Group Ltd. (ACCESS) , the East
African nation’s only publicly traded Internet company, plans to
add 50 buildings to its fiber-optic network and lengthen the
link by 50 kilometres (31 miles).  “We’ve already got 40 buildings approved and ready to
go,” Managing Director Jonathan Somen said in an interview
today at a conference in the capital, Nairobi. “It is all
demand driven so the number will be higher.”  The company provides 400 buildings with access to its 300-
kilometer fiber-optic network in  Kenya , Somen said earlier this
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
