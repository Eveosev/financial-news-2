The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 1.7 percent to 567.47 at 5 p.m.  New York 
time as oil tumbled to an eight-month low on weak unemployment
data from the U.S. and  Germany .  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials fell 1.1
percent to 1,427.922.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell to an eight-month low as unemployment data from
the U.S. and Germany spurred concern about the economic recovery
as European Union leaders met to address the debt crisis.  Prices dropped 3.1 percent after the Labor Department
reported U.S. applications for unemployment benefits hovered
near the highest level of 2012 last week and the prior reading
was revised up. German unemployment rose more than economists
forecast in June. Oil also fell as the  Supreme Court  upheld the
core of President  Barack Obama ’s health-care overhaul.  Crude for August delivery declined $2.52, or 3.1 percent,
to $77.69 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
lowest settlement since October.  Brent oil for August settlement decreased $2.14, or 2.3
percent, to $91.36 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil slid on concern that U.S. economic growth is
stalled and that European leaders won’t reach a consensus on how
to contain the region’s debt crisis, which is threatening the
global recovery and fuel demand.  Futures fell as the  U.S. economy   grew 1.9 percent in the
first quarter, less than the 3 percent gain the prior quarter,
Commerce Department figures showed. First-time jobless claims
fell 6,000 to 386,000 last week, hovering near the highest level
of the year, the Labor Department reported. European leaders are
meeting at an economic summit in Brussels today.  Heating oil  for July delivery fell 4.18 cents, or 1.6
percent, to settle at $2.5519 a gallon on the Nymex. The more
actively traded August contract declined 4.3 cents to $2.5472.  July-delivery gasoline lost 0.62 cent to settle at $2.6142
a gallon. The August contract retreated 2.16 cents, or  0.9
percent, to $2.4773.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas  futures dropped for the first time in six days
after a government report showed that U.S. stockpiles rose more
than forecast last week.  Gas fell 2.7 percent after the Energy Department said
supplies expanded by 57 billion cubic feet to 3.063 trillion.
Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed an expected
increase of 53 billion. Gas rose to a five-month high yesterday
as hot weather boosted fuel demand from  power plants .  Natural gas  for August delivery slid 7.6 cents to $2.722
per million British thermal units on the Nymex.  BASE METALS  Copper  fell the most in a week as unemployment rose in
Germany, fueling concern that a worsening debt crisis for the
euro-currency bloc will undercut demand for the metal.  The number of people out of work in Germany, the world’s
third-biggest copper consumer, rose by a seasonally adjusted
7,000 to 2.88 million, topping the estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  Copper futures for September delivery declined 0.7 percent
to settle at $3.3315 a pound on the Comex in New York.  Aluminum, nickel and tin declined on the London Mercantile
Exchange, while zinc and lead advanced.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold  fell to the lowest level in almost four weeks amid
signs of slowing U.S. growth and as the dollar gained on
speculation that European Union leaders will struggle to solve
the debt crisis. Silver slumped to the cheapest in 19 months.  The number of applications  for U.S.  unemployment benefits 
hovered last week near the highest level of the year, the Labor
Department said. EU leaders meet today and tomorrow for the 19th
summit on battling the fiscal turmoil. This quarter, gold has
dropped 7.3 percent, heading for the biggest decline in eight
years, while the dollar has gained 4.9 percent against a basket
of six currencies.  Gold futures for August delivery dropped 1.8 percent to
settle at $1,550.40 an ounce on the Comex.  Silver futures for September delivery slumped 2.6 percent
to $26.291 an ounce on the Comex, after touching $26.105, the
lowest level since Nov. 18, 2010.  On the Nymex, platinum futures for October delivery dropped
1.7 percent to $1,389.30 an ounce, after earlier sliding to
$1,386.70, the lowest price this year. Palladium futures for
September delivery slumped 2.7 percent to $563.90 an ounce,
falling the most since May 23.  SOFT MARKETS  Cotton futures  rose the most in a week on speculation that
acreage will decline this year in the U.S., the world’s top
exporter, while hot weather threatened crop prospects in  Texas ,
the nation’s biggest grower.  Orange juice  also gained, while
sugar, coffee and cocoa dropped.  Cotton regions in Texas will have dry weather during the
next two weeks with temperatures as much as 2 degrees Fahrenheit
above normal, according to Bethesda, Maryland-based Commodity
Weather Group. U.S. farmers probably cut the planted area by 14
percent, and turned to more profitable crops, such as soybeans,
after prices for the fiber sank 43 percent in the past year, a
Bloomberg survey showed.  Cotton for December delivery climbed 2.3 percent to settle
at 69.51 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, the
biggest gain for a most-active contract since June 19. The

$2,230 a metric ton in New York, the first loss in three days.  LIVESTOCK  Hog prices marked the biggest two-day gain since 2009 on
speculation that hot weather will restrict movement of animals,
limiting the amount available to slaughterhouses. Cattle also
rose.  Temperatures in the U.S. Midwest may top 100 degrees
Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) today, AccuWeather Inc. said.
Farmers will keep hogs indoors and not move them to prevent
illness and weight loss during unusually hot weather,  Dennis
Smith , a senior account executive at Archer Financial Services
Inc., said by telephone.  Hog futures  for August settlement surged 2.4 percent to
settle at 93.9 cents a pound on the  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.
The price gained 5.5 percent in two sessions, the most since
Oct. 8, 2009.  Cattle futures for August delivery advanced 1.8 percent to
$1.19325 a pound in Chicago, the biggest gain since May 3.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn  futures fell for the first time in a week and
soybeans dropped for the third straight day after  weather
forecasts  showed more rain will fall in parts of the U.S.
Midwest, improving prospects for crops.  Some fields from eastern  South Dakota  to  Ohio , including
much of  Iowa , the biggest state producer of both crops, will get
as much as 2 inches (5 centimeters) of rain in the next five
days, according to the  National Weather Service . A cold front
moving south out of Canada will bring heavier rain farther south
than expected, Dave Tolleris, the president of WXRisk.com in
Richmond,  Virginia , said in a report.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 0.1 percent, to
close at $6.3225 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 0.6 cent to

percent this month on speculation that demand will rise as corn
prices rally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
