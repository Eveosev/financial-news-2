Taiwan  may receive a spot cargo of
liquefied natural gas from the Atlantic Ocean area in July,
according to ship-tracking data.  LNG Ondo may reach the Yungan terminal in Taiwan on July
16, after earlier embarking from  Nigeria , according to ship
transmissions captured today by AISLive on Bloomberg.  Taiwan imported two spot cargoes of LNG in May, about 11
percent of its total purchases, from the Atlantic Ocean area,
according to data from the Directorate General of Customs.  The country bought 124,274 metric tons of supplies from
Nigeria at $924 a ton, equivalent to about $19 per million
British thermal units, according to calculations based on
customs data. Prices of the fuel for long- and short-term
contracts averaged about $16 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
