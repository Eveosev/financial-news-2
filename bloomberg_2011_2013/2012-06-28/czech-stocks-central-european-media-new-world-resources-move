The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
snapped two days of gains, falling 0.6 percent to 880.60 at the
close in  Prague , bringing the gauge’s quarterly decline to 9.5
percent.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV)   climbed
1.8 percent to 102 koruna. The broadcaster rebounded a second
day after tumbling 14 percent in the six days ended Jan. 26 to
the lowest price on record in Prague trading. The drop cut the
stock’s 14-day relative strength index to 28.6, below the 30
level that suggests in technical analysis an asset may rise. The
RSI climbed to 29.5 yesterday and 32.8 today.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
