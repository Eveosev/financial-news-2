The euro areaâ€™s economic slump
deepened in June on growing pessimism among consumers and
executives, the  Eurocoin index  showed.  The gauge measuring economic activity in the 17-nation
region fell to minus 0.17 percent from minus 0.03 percent in
May, the London-based  Centre for Economic Policy Research  and
the Bank of Italy, which co-produce the index, said today in an
e-mailed report.  The index will next be published on July 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
