Traces of 2 million-year-old meals
in the teeth of a species of human ancestors showed the hominins
ate the bark of the trees they climbed, as well as leaves and
fruit.  The finding means that ape-like human ancestor
Australopithecus sediba, found in the Malapa Cave in  South
Africa  in 2008, probably lived in forests, rather than the open
savanna, according to a study published by the journal Nature.  The Australopithecus family, which includes the Lucy
fossil, is what many scientists theorize evolved into the human
genus Homo.  Previous research  suggests that the brains, hands,
feet and pelvis of Au. sediba were human-like and may have
represented an intermediate step. That the Au. sediba ate forest
food rather than savanna food makes them more like modern
chimpanzees, the researchers wrote.  The wood and bark tissue found in the teeth “increases the
known variety of early hominin foods,” the scientists wrote in
the study released yesterday. “The overall dietary pattern of
these two individuals contrasts with available data for other
hominins in the region and elsewhere.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
