Austria’s economy is expected to
expand 1.3 percent next year, slower than the 1.4 percent
previously predicted, the state-supported Wifo research
institute said today.  The institute increased its forecast for gross-domestic-
product growth to 0.6 percent for this year, compared to 0.4
percent previously, according to a statement from Wifo today.  “Economic policy in the euro area is facing great
challenges,” Wifo said in the statement. “Against this
background, it seems extremely difficult to predict the
international and domestic economic development,” it said,
adding that its forecast “is subject to very confident
conditions for solving the problems.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
