State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan , the
Azeri energy producer known as Socar, pumped less oil and gas in
the first five months of 2012 than a year earlier.  Oil production fell 2.6 percent to 3.4 million metric tons,
while gas output slid 2.8 percent to 2.86 billion cubic meters,
the Baku-based company said today on its website, without giving
a reason. Socar officials previously attributed falling oil
production to increased safety measures at the BP Plc-led Azeri-
Chirag-Guneshli field after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  The state energy producer pumped 8.4 million tons of oil
and 7 billion cubic meters of gas last year, down from 8.46
million tons of oil and 7.2 billion cubic meters of gas a year
earlier.  Azerbaijan , the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union , cut total oil production by 10 percent to 45.6
million tons last year. Gas output fell 2 percent to 25.8
billion cubic meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
