Loews Corp. (L) , the company run by New
York’s Tisch family, was upgraded by Moody’s Investors Service
on improving finances at its insurance and energy units.  The rating was lifted to A2 from A3 on “the strengthening
credit profile of its primary operating subsidiaries and the
parent company’s stand-alone financial strength and conservative
financial policies,” the ratings firm said today in a statement
on the New York-based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
