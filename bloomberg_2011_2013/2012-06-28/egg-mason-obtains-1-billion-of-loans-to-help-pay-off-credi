Legg Mason Inc. (LM) , a Baltimore-based
money manager, obtained $1 billion of bank loans used in part to
pay off borrowings under its revolving  credit line .  The new debt consists of a $500 million term loan and $500
million revolver, both of which mature in June 2017, according
to a regulatory filing today.  Citigroup Inc., Bank of New York Mellon and State Street
Bank and Trust Co. are among banks providing the credit, the
filing shows.  Legg Mason used proceeds from the term portion to pay down
the outstanding $500 million balance under its previous
revolver, the company said in the filing. The new revolving
credit line will be used for working capital and general
corporate needs.  Under a revolver, money can be borrowed again once it’s
repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
