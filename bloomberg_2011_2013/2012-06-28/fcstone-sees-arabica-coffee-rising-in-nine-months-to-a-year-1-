Arabica coffee prices will be higher
in nine months to a year because of low stockpiles, spurring
investors who are expecting lower prices to reverse those bets,
according to INTL FCStone Ltd.  Hedge funds  and other money managers were net short, or
betting on lower prices, by 12,105 futures and options as of
June 19, Commodity Futures Trading Commission  data  show. Arabica
coffee prices have dropped 28 percent this year because of
record production in  Brazil , the world’s largest grower.
Stockpiles by Sept. 30 will be 24.1 million bags, the lowest
since Sept. 30. 2001, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  “It looks to us at this point that the short position will
be covered,” Stephen Pollard, a senior vice president at INTL
FCStone (Europe) Ltd., said at a conference in Geneva today.
“We are really struggling to see where the sales are going to
come from, who is going to sell to the funds when they start
buying.”  If funds revert to the position they were at by the end of
2010, that would generate buying of 40,000 contracts, he said.
That corresponds to 10 million bags of coffee, he said. World
coffee output will be 148 million bags in the 2012-13 season
that starts in October, the USDA forecasts.  Robusta Forecast  Robusta coffee will trade at $1,900 to $2,300 a metric ton
in  London  for the next three months, Pollard said. The September
futures contract was at $2,093 a ton at 3:21 p.m. in London.  “There is a big speculative position short arabica and
long robusta in the market that will unwind,” he said. Bigger
crops in  Vietnam  and Indonesia will limit price gains, he said.  The crop in Vietnam, the biggest robusta producer, will be
24.5 million bags, up from 20.3 million a year earlier,
according to Holland Capital LLP, an agriculture investment
company in London. In Indonesia, the third-biggest robusta
grower, farmers will harvest 7.4 million bags of the variety in
the 2012-13 season that started there in April, up 2 million
bags from a year earlier, it estimated.  Robusta beans, grown mainly in  Asia  and parts of  Africa ,
are used in instant drinks. Arabica, harvested mainly in  Latin
America , is favored by Starbucks Corp., the world’s biggest
coffee shop owner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
