South Africa  is poised to overtake
 India  this year as the world’s third-largest exporter of iron
ore, Morgan Stanley said after cutting estimates for seaborne
supply from the South Asian nation.  Indian shipments of the steelmaking raw material by sea
will be 41 million metric tons, 40 percent less than the 68
million tons predicted in March, the investment bank said in its
Global Metals Playbook, dated today. South African seaborne
exports will come to 53 million tons, 4 million tons more than
its prior forecast, Morgan Stanley said.  India has ranked third among  iron-ore  exporters after world
leader Australia and  Brazil  since at least 2004, Morgan Stanley
figures show. Indian shipments are declining after higher export
duties were introduced in December, the bank said in a March
report. Exports from the country peaked at 114 million tons in
2009, according to Morgan Stanley’s data.  Canadian exports of the ore by sea will come to 36 million
tons, more than double the 15-million-ton estimate made three
months ago, the report showed. Total seaborne supply of  iron ore 
this year was projected at 1.02 billion tons by Morgan Stanley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
