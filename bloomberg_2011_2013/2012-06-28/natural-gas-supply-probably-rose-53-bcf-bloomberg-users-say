The U.S. Energy Department’s
natural-gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30

last week, according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s report will show that inventories gained
53 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 22 to 3.059
trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for August delivery fell 0.6 cent, or 0.2
