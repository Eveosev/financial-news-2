Grupo Sports World SAB (SPORTS) ,  Mexico ’s
only publicly-traded gym operator, surged the most in four
months after its board authorized an investment group to
purchase a minority stake.  The shares climbed 3.2 percent to 13.93 pesos at the close
of trading in Mexico City, the biggest advance since Feb. 20.
The benchmark IPC index of 35 Mexican companies rose 0.4 percent
while the IRT Small Capitalization index, of which Sports World
is a part, rose 0.2 percent to 236.02.  The gym operator’s board approved the acquisition of as
much as 9.99 percent of Sports World shares by an undisclosed
investor group, according to a filing yesterday to Mexico’s
stock exchange.  “The company is luring new investment,”  Gerardo Copca , an
analyst with Metanalisis SA, said in a telephone interview from
Mexico City. “Their expansion plan is going to continue.”  The Mexico City-based company also cut its 2012 revenue and
profit margin forecasts yesterday. Revenue will grow 43.5
percent this year, down from a previous projection of 50
percent, according to a statement yesterday. Its profit margin
based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization will be 16 percent, down from a previous forecast
of 19 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
