Tottenham said coaches Kevin Bond
and Joe Jordan have left the Premier League club, two weeks
after  Harry Redknapp ’s four-year spell as manager ended.  “We should like to thank them for their contribution and
achievements during their time at the club and wish them all the
best for the future,” Tottenham said in a  statement  on its
website.  Bond and Jordan joined the north London soccer team
following the appointment of Redknapp in 2008. Redknapp was
fired this month, with Chairman Daniel Levy saying it was “not
a decision the board and I have taken lightly.”  Spurs finished fourth in the Premier League last season,
though missed out on a Champions League berth when Chelsea won
Europe’s elite club competition.  The club has yet to appoint a new manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
