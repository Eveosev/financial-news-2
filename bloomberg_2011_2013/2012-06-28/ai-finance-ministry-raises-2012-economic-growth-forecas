Thailand’s  Finance Ministry  raised
its 2012 economic growth forecast for a second time as
manufacturing and local demand recovered from the nation’s worst
floods in almost 70 years.   Gross domestic product is estimated to expand by 5.2
percent to 6.2 percent, with a midpoint forecast of 5.7 percent,
Somchai Sujjapongse, head of the fiscal policy office, said
today in Bangkok. The ministry in March predicted the economy
would grow about 5.5 percent this year.  Industrial output rose more than economists expected in May
as supply constraints after last year’s floods eased, supporting
Thailand’s economic recovery, a separate government report today
showed. The industrial production index rose 5.53 percent from a
year earlier, compared with the median of 11 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey for a 2.5 percent gain.  Thailand ’s central bank this month maintained its estimate
for gross domestic product growth at 6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
