The following companies had unusual
price changes in Mexico City trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the close of trading.  The  IPC index  rose 0.4 percent to 39,637.66.  America Movil SAB (AMXL)  , the wireless carrier
controlled by the Mexican billionaire  Carlos Slim , rose 0.2
percent to 17.24 pesos. The company won the stake it sought in
 Royal KPN NV (KPN)  yesterday, increasing its influence in Europe
despite opposition from the Dutch company.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO)  , the largest cement maker in the
Americas, gained 2.2 percent to 8.77 pesos. The company is
trying to prevent a financing crunch in 2014 as a housing slump
in the U.S. and a deepening debt crisis in Europe erode sales.  Grupo Bimbo SAB (BIMBOA)  , the world’s largest
breadmaker, rose 1.5 percent to 32.05 pesos. Earlier this month
the company announced it would forgo takeovers through 2014
after 15 acquisitions over the past decade helped drive debt
relative to earnings to a two-year high.  Grupo Modelo SAB (GMODELOC)  , Mexico’s largest beermaker,
rose 3.8 percent to 117.74 pesos. Earlier this week shares
rallied as much as 19 percent after a person familiar with the
matter said Anheuser-Busch InBev NV was seeking to buy the rest
of the Mexican brewer for about $20 billion.  Grupo Sports World SAB (SPORTS MM), a gym operator trading
on Mexico’s small-capitalization index, rose 3.2 percent to
13.93 pesos after climbing as much as 5.9 percent earlier in
Mexico City trading, the biggest intraday advance since Nov. 9.
Sports World’s board authorized an investment group yesterday to
purchase as much as 9.99 percent of the company’s shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
