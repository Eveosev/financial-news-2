Japan   stocks  rose a second day as
the nation’s retail sales and U.S. housing data and durable
goods orders gained more than estimated in May, showing signs of
global economic strength before a European debt summit today.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s biggest carmaker, rose 2.6
percent. Clothing retailer Shimamura Co. gained 2.6 percent.
 Eisai Co. (4523)  climbed 3.1 percent after its partner won U.S.
approval for a weight-loss drug.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 1.7 percent to 8,874.11
at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo . The broader Topix Index gained 1.8
percent to 758.81, with almost four shares advancing for each
that fell.  “The  U.S. economy  is recovering bit by bit,” said
Yoshihisa Okamoto, who helps oversee about $34 billion at Mizuho
Asset Management Co. “Japan is strengthening as demand recovers
from the earthquake. Investors’ eyes are on companies that rely
on domestic demand.”  The  Topix (MXAP)  has fallen 13 percent from its peak on March 27
as growth in the U.S. and China slowed amid concern Europe’s
debt crisis is spreading. Stocks on the gauge are valued at 0.89
times book value, with a number below one meaning a company can
be bought for less than the value of its assets.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.1
percent today. The gauge gained 0.9 percent in New York
yesterday as contracts to buy existing homes and orders for
durable goods rebounded in May, beating analysts’ expectations.  Toyota gained 2.6 percent to 3,110 yen. Funai Electric Co.,
a television maker that gets more than half of its sales from
 North America , jumped 3.3 percent to 1,203 yen.  ‘Worries Fading’  “Worries about the U.S. housing market are fading,” said
Mizuho Asset Management’s Okamoto. “There was concern U.S.
efforts to lower  interest rates  weren’t raising demand for
housing, but they may start taking effect.”  Europe’s leaders will meet today in Brussels amid a
breakdown in consensus on how to safeguard Spain and Italy from
higher borrowing costs. German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  shut the
door on joint euro-area bonds, saying such securities are
unconstitutional in Germany and economically “wrong and
counterproductive.” Euro-area finance ministers earlier
approved a bailout request from Cyprus.  Japanese stocks also gained after the Trade Ministry said
retail sales advanced 3.6 percent from a year earlier after a
5.7 percent increase in April. The median estimate of 13
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 2.9 percent
increase.  Shimamura climbed 2.6 percent to 9,010 yen. Edion Corp., an
electronics retailer, advanced 3.4 percent to 400 yen.  Nitori Holdings Co. (9843)  jumped 4.7 percent to 7,400 yen. The
company reported a 26 percent gain to 9.86 billion yen ($124
million) in net income for the three months ended May 20, while
sales rose 11 percent on recovering demand for furniture and
interior goods.  Eisai gained 3.1 percent to 3,475 yen after San Diego-based
partner Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc. won Food and Drug
Administration approval for the first obesity medication cleared
for the U.S. in 13 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
