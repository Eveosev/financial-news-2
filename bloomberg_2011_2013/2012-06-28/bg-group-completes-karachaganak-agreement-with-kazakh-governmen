BG Group Plc (BG/)  completed an agreement
giving  Kazakhstan  10 percent of the Karachaganak oil project and
exempting the venture from paying export duty.  The government acquired the stake for $2 billion in cash
and $1 billion in non-cash payments, BG Group said today in a
statement. Tax of $1 billion is payable on the gain from the
sale, it said. The Karachaganak partners won’t pay export duty
for the remaining 26 years of their production sharing deal.  The agreement also allows the partners to deliver an extra
2 million metric tons of oil annually through the Caspian
Pipeline Consortium’s link in the period, BG Group said. The
additional shipments will begin at 500,000 tons and rise to 2
million tons as the pipeline expands in the next three years.  The deal settles a more than two-year dispute between the
partners and Kazakhstan, the biggest energy producer in central
 Asia , over paying tax and recovering costs. The production-
sharing agreement allows the investors to recoup their costs
before the government takes its share of the oil revenues.  Kazakh Oil Minister Sauat Mynbayev and Finance Minister
Bolat Zhamishev were scheduled to sign the agreement with the
partners, according to a government order dated June 25 and
published today in state-run newspaper  Kazakhstanskaya Pravda .  BG Group’s interest in the project falls to 29.25 percent
today from 32.5 percent, it said.  Eni SpA (ENI) ’s stake also dropped
to 29.25 percent, while Chevron Corp. has 18 percent, OAO Lukoil
13.5 percent. State-run KazMunaiGaz National Co. gets 10
percent. Karachaganak is estimated to hold 9 billion barrels of
condensate and 48 trillion cubic feet of gas, BG said.
