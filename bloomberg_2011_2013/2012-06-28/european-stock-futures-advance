European stock futures climbed,
indicating the region’s equities will extend yesterday’s rally,
before the leaders of the European Union attend a two-day
summit. U.S. index futures fluctuated, while Asian shares rose.  Royal KPN NV might be active after  Carlos Slim ’s America
Movil SAB won a 28 percent stake in the Dutch mobile-phone
operator.  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  may also move as the
company seeks to revive its takeover of Xstrata Plc.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in September
advanced 0.5 percent to 2,166 at 7:10 a.m. in London. Contracts
on the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index gained 0.3 percent. Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index futures added 0.1 percent, while the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index jumped 1 percent.  European and U.S. stocks climbed yesterday after U.S.
housing and  durable-goods orders  data exceeded forecasts and
speculation grew that  China  will opt for additional economic
stimulus to support the world’s second-largest economy. Asian
equities extended the global rally today as Japanese retail
sales rose in May more than economists had predicted.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index has still declined 9.7 percent
from its high in March, trimming the gauge’s advance so far this
year to 0.5 percent, as the euro area’s sovereign-debt crisis
threatened to slow global growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
