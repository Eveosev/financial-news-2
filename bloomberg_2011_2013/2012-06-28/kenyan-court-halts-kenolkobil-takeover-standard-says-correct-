(Corrects newspaper in first paragraph.)  Kenya’s Industrial Court blocked
KenolKobil Ltd. from implementing a takeover by Puma Energy BV
after a group of employees argued the transaction may change
their employment status, the Standard reported.  A hearing on the application will take place on July 11,
the Nairobi-based newspaper said, citing court documents.  KenolKobil said yesterday Puma is continuing due diligence
on the proposed takeover and it’s “cautiously optimistic” a
deal will take place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
