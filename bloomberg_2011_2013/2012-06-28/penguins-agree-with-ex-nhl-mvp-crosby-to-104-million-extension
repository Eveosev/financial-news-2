Sidney Crosby , who won the  National
Hockey League ’s Most Valuable Player award in 2007 and missed
parts of the last two seasons with concussion symptoms and a
neck injury, agreed on a $104.4 million contract extension with
the  Pittsburgh Penguins .  Crosby can’t sign the deal until July 1 under the league’s
collective bargaining agreement, the team said on its website.
The 12-year extension, which goes into effect after next season
and keeps the 24-year-old center under contract through the
2024-25 season, will cost $8.7 million annually toward the
league salary cap, according to the Penguins.  After he played just 28 games in the last 18 months due to
lingering effects of a concussion, Crosby’s new deal is the
second most-expensive contract in NHL history, according to  USA
Today . It trails only  Washington Capitals  forward  Alex Ovechkin ,
who signed a 13-year, $124 million deal in 2008, the newspaper
said.  “We look forward to having him in a Penguins uniform for
the rest of his career,” Penguins co-owners  Mario Lemieux  and
 Ron Burkle  said today in a joint statement. “He is an excellent
player and an even better person, and he is a great ambassador
for the Penguins and for Pittsburgh.”  The Penguins selected Crosby with the first pick in the
2005 NHL Draft. He scored at least 100 points in four of his
first five years, including a league-high 120 points during the
2006-07 season, after which he was named league MVP. In 434
games, he has scored 223 goals with 386 assists, an average of
1.4 points per game.  Gold Medal  A four-time All-Star, he led the Penguins to the Stanley
Cup championship in 2009, at 21 the youngest captain in NHL
history to win the league title. He also captained the Canadian
team to the gold medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics in  Vancouver .  “In an era when players often move from team to team, it’s
gratifying to see a young man who is so committed to one city
and one franchise,” Penguins Chief Executive David Morehouse
said on the website. “He’s meant so much to the Penguins, to
the growth of youth hockey in Pittsburgh, and to the NHL and the
game of hockey in general. It’s a tremendous feeling to know
he’ll be here through 2025.”  Crosby suffered a concussion on Jan. 1, 2011, when he
collided with Capitals center David Steckel. Crosby remained in
the game, but played just once more that season, when a hit from
Tampa Bay Lightning defenseman Victor Hedman left him with
severe concussion symptoms. Despite missing half the season, his
66 points were most on the team.  Concussion Symptoms  Crosby returned to the ice last November after missing the
first 20 games of the 2011-12 season, but the concussion-like
symptoms returned after seven games. He returned a second time
in March, this time scoring eight goals and adding 29 assists in
22 total regular-season games.  Crosby will be 37 when the new contract expires. Should he
remain in Pittsburgh for the remainder of his career, his talent
and leadership could further comparisons to Lemieux, another
career-long Penguin.  A 10-time All-Star and member of the Hockey Hall of Fame,
Lemieux spent his entire 17-year career in Pittsburgh, winning
Stanley Cup titles in 1991 and 1992, and an Olympic gold medal
in 2002. He and Crosby were teammates for 26 games during the
2005-06 season. Crosby lived in Lemieux’s house during his first
three seasons in the NHL.  “He’s a very special player and knowing that he will be
here long-term is outstanding news for our players, coaches,
staff and fans,” Penguins General Manager Ray Shero said of
Crosby. “Sidney also brings those extra dimensions as our
captain, with his leadership in the room and on the ice.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
