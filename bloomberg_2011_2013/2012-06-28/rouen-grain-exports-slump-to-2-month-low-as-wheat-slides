Grain exports from the French port
of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, fell 34 percent
in the latest week as shipments of wheat and barley slumped.  Cargoes slid to 39,980 metric tons between June 21 and June
27 from 60,368 tons a week earlier, the  Seine River port  wrote
in an e-mailed report today. That included 35,816 tons of soft
wheat, down from 45,086 tons the week before.  Grain loadings fell to the lowest since the seven days
through April 25. Algeria was the main destination in the most
recent period with 25,001 tons of soft wheat, followed by
 Portugal  with 9,025 tons.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of  France ’s grain exports by
sea in 2010-11, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay and
Dunkirk on the  North Sea , which shipped out 17 percent and 11
percent respectively, according to port data.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
