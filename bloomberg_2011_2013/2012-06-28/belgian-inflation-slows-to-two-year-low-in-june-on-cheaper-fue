Belgium ’s inflation slowed in June
to the lowest in more than two years as prices for motor and
heating fuel declined, offsetting higher costs of trips abroad
and fresh fruit.  The inflation rate in Belgium, the sixth-largest economy in
the euro region, slowed to 2.26 percent, the lowest rate since
April 2010, and compared with 2.81 percent in May, the Ministry
of Economic Affairs in Brussels said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Excluding energy, inflation slowed to 2.27 percent from
2.37 percent in May, according to today’s report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
