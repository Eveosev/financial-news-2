The U.S. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau issued a final rule under which it pledges to
honor attorney-client privilege when it shares information from
banks with other federal and state agencies.  “We are committed to safeguarding the confidential
information of the institutions we supervise to ensure the
Bureau is best equipped to do its job and protect consumers,”
 Richard Cordray , the bureau’s director, said in an e-mail
statement. “This new rule supports the free flow of information
that is essential to an effective supervision program.”  In January, the bureau advised banks that it supervises --
those with more than $10 billion in assets -- that giving CFPB
information doesn’t waive any associated privilege. The rule
states that privilege also remains intact if the bureau shares
information with other federal or state agencies, it said in the
statement.  Bank lawyers have argued that the CFPB could obtain
information covered by attorney-client privilege and share it
with other officials, notably state attorneys general. The
bureau is not covered by a 2006 law that requires other
regulators like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to respect
this privilege.  Cordray said on Jan. 12 that he wouldn’t oppose a
legislative push by lenders to have the bureau added to the
roster of agencies bound by the law. The House passed such a
bill on March 26. Senator  Tim Johnson , the South Dakota Democrat
who leads the Banking Committee, introduced similar legislation
in the Senate on Feb. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
