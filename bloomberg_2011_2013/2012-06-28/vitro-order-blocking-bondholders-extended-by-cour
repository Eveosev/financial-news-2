Vitro SAB (VITROA)  bondholders are blocked
from seizing assets of the Mexican glassmaker after a federal
appeals court extended a lower-court order during an appeal over
the company’s bankruptcy restructuring.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans today temporarily
extended a stay that a bankruptcy judge in Dallas imposed
earlier this month when he refused to enforce Vitro’s Mexican
reorganization plan in the U.S.  The appellate court granted a direct appeal of the ruling
by the bankruptcy judge and told the bondholders to submit
papers by July 2 opposing an extension of the stay halting asset
seizures. The bankruptcy court’s restraining order was set to
expire tomorrow.  The appeals court said the temporary stay it imposed will
remain in effect “pending further order of this court,”
according to a court filing.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harlin DeWayne Hale in Dallas refused
to enforce Vitro’s reorganization in the U.S., saying it is
“manifestly contrary” to U.S. public policy  The case is Vitro SAB v. Ad Hoc Group of Vitro Noteholders,
12-10689, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (New
Orleans).  To contact the reporters on this story:
