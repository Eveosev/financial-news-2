Vietnam , the worldâ€™s biggest
producer of robusta coffee, may export 160,000 metric tons this
month, according to figures released today by the General
Statistics Office in Hanoi, more than double the quantity
shipped a year earlier.  Exports in the first half of the year were estimated at
1.06 million tons, up 22 percent from a year earlier. The nation
exported 204,000 tons in May, 36 percent higher than a previous
assessment of 150,000 tons, revised figures from the Statistics
Office show.  Vietnam exported 67,000 tons in June last year, according
to preliminary GSO data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
