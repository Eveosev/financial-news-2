Oando Plc (OANDO) , an energy company, headed
for its lowest in more than nine years, as oil,  Nigeria ’s key
export, retreated in the second quarter.  The shares dropped 5 percent, the daily limit, to 12.45
naira by 1:15 p.m. in Lagos, down for a third day. A close at
that price would be the lowest since May 2003, extending the
second-quarter retreat to 43 percent.  Bonny Light crude, Nigeria’s benchmark blend, fell 0.5
percent to $93.69 per barrel, the first time in five days,
deepening the plunge in the second quarter to 25 percent, the
biggest three-month drop since December 2008.  “Over 50 percent of Oando’s profit comes from crude oil
production,” Pabina Yinkere, head of research at Lagos-based
Vetiva Capital Management, said by phone today. “A decline in
 oil prices  will lead to investors being cautious on the stock.”  Oando’s net income for the 12 months through December fell
74 percent to 3.67 billion naira ($23 million), the company said
May 21. The company expected a drop in profit after a 9.62
billion naira write-off, Chief Executive Officer Wale Tinubu
said April 10, citing “impairment of assets,” costs of
acquisitions and other charges.  Aside from oil production, the company’s operations include
refining and marketing of petroleum products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
