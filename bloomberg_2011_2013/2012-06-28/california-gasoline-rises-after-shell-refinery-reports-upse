California-blend gasoline gained
against futures after  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  reported a wet-gas
compressor malfunction at a refinery in Northern California.  Shell’s 158,000-barrel-a-day Martinez refinery flared
sulfur dioxide at 11:09 p.m. local time yesterday after a “wet
gas compressor problem,” The Hague-based company said in a
filing with the California Emergency Management Agency. Emily Oberton, a Shell spokeswoman in Houston, declined to comment.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco
advanced 2.75 cents to a premium of 9 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 4:52 p.m.
East Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
same fuel in Los Angeles also rose 2.75 cents to a 9-cent
premium to futures.  Carbob tumbled yesterday after  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and
 Phillips 66 (PSX)  restored operations at their refineries in  Southern
California  following upsets.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in  Los Angeles  gained
0.75 cent to a premium of 4.5 cents a gallon against Nymex
heating oil futures. San Francisco CARB diesel dropped 1.75
cents, to parity with futures.  Carbob gasoline inventories rose 5.4 percent last week to
4.8 million barrels from 4.55 million a week earlier, the state
Energy Commission said in an e-mailed report yesterday.
California-blend, or CARB, diesel supplies dropped 9.4 percent
to 2.14 million barrels, the state said.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Portland ,  Oregon , strengthened 1 cent to a 5.5-cents-a-gallon
discount to gasoline futures. Low-sulfur diesel in Portland was
unchanged at 11.5 cents a gallon over heating oil futures.  Gasoline inventories  in the U.S. West Coast, known as the
PADD 5 region, slipped 1.1 percent to 27.1 million barrels last
week, the Energy Department said yesterday. Low-sulfur  diesel
supplies  in the region climbed 0.4 percent to 10.7 million
barrels, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
