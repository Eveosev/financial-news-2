Most Asian currencies gained after
reports showed U.S. home sales and durable-goods orders topped
economists’ estimates and on speculation  China  will take steps
to spur its economy.  India’s rupee snapped a two-day loss and South Korea’s won
climbed for a third day as the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of
regional shares rose the most in a week. Gains were limited
before European Union leaders start a two-day meeting in
Brussels. Banks including Citigroup Inc., Nomura Holdings Inc.
and ING Groep NV are predicting the People’s Bank of China will
cut banks’ reserve requirements again this year.  “With the good data out of the U.S. and gains in stocks,
risk sentiment is quite stable now,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a
Bangkok-based trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. “The
currencies are likely to be quite range-bound before the results
of the European summit come out.”  The rupee rebounded 0.2 percent to 57.03 per dollar as of 2
p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The won
closed 0.2 percent stronger at 1,154.40, the  Philippine peso 
added 0.1 percent to 42.34 and the Taiwan’s dollar rose as much
as 0.5 percent to NT$29.956 before giving up all of its gains.  The 60-day historical volatility in the Bloomberg-JPMorgan
Asia  Dollar Index  rose to 2.93 percent from 2.92 percent
yesterday. The index has dropped 2.3 percent this quarter amid
concern  Europe ’s crisis will sap demand for Asian exports and as
 China’s economy  grew at the slowest pace in almost three years.  U.S. Data  Pending home resales in the U.S. climbed 5.9 percent after
a 5.5 percent decline in April, the National Association of
Realtors reported yesterday. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
forecast a 1.5 percent gain. Orders for durable goods rose 1.1
percent in May, the Commerce Department said, compared with the
median forecast for a 0.5 percent increase.  The won gained as the  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index of stocks rose for the
first time in six days. An official report showed the country’s
current-account surplus widened in May to a six-month high of
$3.6 billion.  “The current-account data confirms the positive outlook on
the won,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a Seoul-based currency analyst at
Samsung Futures Inc.  China’s  yuan  was little changed at 6.3575 per dollar in
 Shanghai , paring an earlier drop of as much as 0.21 percent. The
central bank weakened its fixing rate by 0.03 percent at 6.3190.
The world’s second-largest economy expanded 8.1 percent in the
first three months of the year, the least since the second
quarter of 2009.  “Investors aren’t optimistic that European leaders will
come up with any remedies,” said  Daniel Chan , executive vice-
president at Glory Sky Global Markets Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “China
won’t let the yuan strengthen as it wants to support exports
given how bad the external environment is.”  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah dropped 0.1 percent to 9,450
per dollar and the Vietnamese dong was steady at 20,903.
Malaysia’s ringgit fell 0.2 percent to 3.1961, while the baht
traded at 31.87 versus 31.88 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
