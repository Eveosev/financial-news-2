Asian  stocks  rose for a second day
after reports showed U.S. home sales and durable goods orders
climbed more than estimated and investors awaited the start of a
summit on Europe’s debt crisis.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  advanced 2.6 percent, leading gains
among Japanese carmakers.  Daiei Inc. (8263) , an operator of department
stores, jumped 11 percent as Japanese retail sales gained more
than estimated in May. News Corp. gained 4.1 percent in Sydney
as a person with knowledge of the situation said the board
approved in principle a plan to split the company’s publishing
unit from its entertainment division.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (TPX)  advanced 0.8 percent to 114.98
at 7:18 p.m. in Tokyo. Five stocks rose for every four that
fell. The gauge fell 12 percent through yesterday from its
highest level of 2012 in February amid concern growth in China
and the U.S. is slowing as the euro-zone debt crisis escalates.  “The  U.S. economy  is recovering bit by bit,” said
Yoshihisa Okamoto, who helps oversee about $34 billion at Mizuho
Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “The economic data was good,
boosting the markets. Worries about the U.S. housing market are
fading. There was concern U.S. efforts to lower  interest rates 
weren’t raising demand for housing, but these may start taking
effect.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP) ’s 0.2 percent gain this year
through yesterday compares with a 5.9 percent advance by the S&P
500 and a 0.5 percent increase on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.7 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.8 times for the  S&P 500 
and 10.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  Nikkei, Kospi  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.8 percent, reversing
and earlier increase after China’s Shanghai Composite Index
closed below the 2,200 level that marked the erasure of all the
year’s gains.  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.7 percent.
South Korea’s Kospi added 0.1 percent and Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index was little changed.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent
today. The stock gauge gained 0.9 percent in New York yesterday
as orders for durable goods and the number of Americans signing
contracts to buy an existing home rebounded in May. The index of
pending home resales climbed 5.9 percent after a 5.5 percent
decline in April, the National Association of Realtors reported.
Economists forecast a 1.5 percent gain.  Orders for durable goods climbed more than forecast in May,
easing concern that U.S. manufacturing is faltering. Bookings
rose 1.1 percent, a Commerce Department report showed. The
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called
for a 0.5 percent gain.  Brussels Summit  In Europe, German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  shut the door to
joint euro-area bonds as a means of lowering Spain’s borrowing
costs, saying they are the “wrong way” to achieve the greater
European integration needed to stem the debt crisis.  Speaking three hours after Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano
Rajoy  made a plea for help from today’s European leaders’ summit
in Brussels, Merkel said that euro bonds, euro bills and debt
redemption funds are unconstitutional in Germany and
economically “wrong and counterproductive.”  Exporters that generate sales in the U.S. advanced. Toyota,
which gets 20 percent of its revenue in  North America , advanced
2.6 percent to 3,110 yen in Tokyo. James Hardie Industries SE, a
manufacturer of home siding, rose 0.5 percent to A$7.70 in
Sydney.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , a maker of power tools and
vacuum cleaners, increased 0.9 percent to HK$9.63 in Hong Kong.  News Corp. (NWS)   Daiei gained 11 percent to 255 yen after the retail-sales
data in Japan. Shimamura Co., a clothing retailer, rose 2.6
percent to 9,010 yen. The Trade Ministry said retail sales
advanced 3.6 percent from a year earlier after a 5.7 percent
increase in April.  News Corp. gained 4.1 percent to A$22.37 in Sydney. An
announcement is planned tomorrow morning, said a person with
knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be identified
because the decision isn’t public. In an e-mail, the company
declined to comment.  Eisai Co. (4523)  jumped 3.1 percent to 3,475 yen in Tokyo after
its partner won Food and Drug Administration approval for
weight-loss pill lorcaserin, making it the first obesity
medication cleared for sale in the U.S. in 13 years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
