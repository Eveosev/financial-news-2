Chilean industrial production rose
3.2 percent and industrial sales rose 4.1 percent in May from a
year earlier, manufacturers’ association Sofofa said.  Growth was led by the food, drinks and tobacco segment,
which expanded 13 percent, Sofofa said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Salmon exports drove the expansion in sales, the group
said. Domestic sales data continue to indicate that  Chile ’s
consumers are driving economic growth while the industrial
sector contracts. Consumer goods sales rose 5.5 percent from a
year earlier while sales of capital goods fell 30 percent.  The National Statistics Institute will tomorrow publish its
manufacturing and industrial data for May. The median forecast
of seven economists in a  Bloomberg survey  is that manufacturing
growth eased to 1.2 percent from 2.6 percent in April.  May 2012 had one less working day this year than the same
month in 2011, Sofofa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
