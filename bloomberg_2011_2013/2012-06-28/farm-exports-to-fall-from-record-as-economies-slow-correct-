(Corrects import forecast number in eighth paragraph in
story published May 31.)  U.S. farm exports will drop 2.1
percent from a record in the year that began Oct. 1 as slower
economic growth erodes sales of grain, oilseeds and cotton to
European Union countries, the government said.  Shipments worldwide will slide to $134.5 billion, the
second-highest on record, from $137.4 billion in fiscal year
2011, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a
quarterly  report . Estimated exports to the EU will fall 17
percent to $8.5 billion, after sales in first half of the year
dropped 21 percent, the USDA said.  “Continuing turmoil in European financial markets, coupled
with falling employment and GDP in most of the  euro zone ,
reflects a recession likely to last through most of 2012,” the
USDA said in the report. “World 2012 growth is expected to
slow.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Agricultural Spot Index is down
7.2 percent since the start of October. Corn, the most valuable
U.S. commodity, is down 6.3 percent.  Soybean exports to the EU in the current fiscal year have
dropped to $360 million from $1.1 billion at the same time a
year ago, the USDA said. Corn shipments to the trading bloc in
the first half were down 85 percent to $37 million, according to
the report.  Top Customers  The overall export forecast was up from a February estimate
of $131 billion as the outlook for grain exports improved.
 Canada  will be the biggest U.S. trading partner, with estimated
purchases of $20 billion, followed by  Mexico  at $19 billion and
 China , excluding  Hong Kong , with $18.5 billion, the USDA said.  Fueled by export demand, U.S. net  farm income  reached an
all-time high of $98.1 billion in calendar year 2011 and will
reach $91.7 billion this year, the second-highest, the USDA said
in February. The department will update its farm-export forecast
in August.  U.S. agricultural imports are projected to reach $107.5
billion, up $1 billion from the February forecast and a 14
percent increase from $94.5 billion in the previous year.  “Increases are forecast for vegetable oils, oilseeds,
oilmeal, bulk grains and beef and veal imports,” the USDA said.
“Larger imports of rapeseed oil from Canada are leading the
vegetable-oil gains.”  The USDA predicts a  trade surplus  for the year of $27
billion, 10 percent higher than the February estimate while
below the record $42.9 billion in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
