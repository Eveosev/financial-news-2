Japan’s government has 1.2 trillion
yen ($15 billion) in left-over funds from last year’s budgets,
money that can be used this year to reduce debt and fund fresh
spending, the Finance Ministry estimates.  Tax revenue for the year ended March 2012 was 42.8 trillion
yen, 803 billion yen more than the government estimated,
according to a ministry document obtained by Bloomberg News.  Extra budget funds may provide some relief to Prime
Minister  Yoshihiko Noda , who this week managed to obtain lower
house approval for a bill to double the  sales tax  to 10 percent
by 2015 to tame the world’s largest public debt.  Fitch Ratings 
lowered Japan’s debt rating in May, citing the “leisurely”
progress of Japan’s fiscal consolidation while Moody’s Investors
Service lowered the country’s rating last year, keeping it on a
negative watch.  The government also issued fewer new  government bonds  last
fiscal year than initial estimated because of the increased tax
revenue, helping trim debt service costs. New bond sales were
42.8 trillion yen, 1.8 trillion yen less than the projection,
the document shows.  On top of the 1.2 trillion yen in left-over money, the
government also had 748.9 billion yen in unused funds which had
been allocated to pay for earthquake-reconstruction efforts,
according to the document.  To contact the reporters on this story:
