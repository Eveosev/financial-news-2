Liberia’s  Agriculture Ministry  kept
dead employees on its payroll and can’t account for millions of
dollars in donor funding, the West African nation’s auditor-
general said.  The ministry continued to pay salaries to 87 people who had
retired or resigned, or were deceased, Winsley Nanka, acting
auditor-general, said in a report on the website of the General
Auditing Commission.  Ministry officials also failed to produce documentation of
14 agricultural projects sponsored by international donors,
including the World Bank and  China , according to the report,
which was published on its website today. The auditor
investigated the period between July 2006 and June 2009.  There were no records at the ministry detailing whether the
projects had been completed, and how the funds, which amounted
to at least $6 million, had been used, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
