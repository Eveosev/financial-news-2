OAO Acron, a Russian fertilizer
maker, fell the most in almost a week after shareholders voted
against paying a final 2011 dividend.  The stock dropped as much as 2 percent to 1,125 rubles, the
steepest intraday decline since June 22, and traded down 0.9
percent as of 4 p.m. in Moscow.  Shareholders rejected a payout of 46 rubles ($1.39) per
share, according to an a regulatory filing today. Elena
Kochubey, a spokeswoman for the company, declined to elaborate
on the reasons for this decision. Russian billionaire
Viatcheslav Kantor owns 84.6 percent in Acron, according to the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
