Uruguay’s government is going
forward with plans to build its first deepwater port which it
wants to use as a platform to begin exporting iron-ore to  China .  Construction of the port on the country’s Atlantic
coastline will begin in 2014, according to a  decree  signed by
President Jose Mujica and published on his website today
expropriating land where the port will be built.  China has expressed interest in investing in the port, Vice
President Danilo Astori said over the weekend following a
meeting in Montevideo with Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao .  Minera Aratiri since 2007 has been developing a project to
export an estimated 18 million metric tons a year of iron-ore
that the Montevideo-based company says would convert Uruguay
into the world’s  eighth-largest producer  of the mineral.  Aratiri says it would create 1,500 permanent jobs and
contribute $1.4 billion to Uruguay’s $39 billion economy over
the life of the 20-30 year project.  Aratiri is controlled by Zamin Ferrous, a closely held
miner which also is developing iron-ore projects in  Brazil .  To contact the reporter on this story:
