Natural gas flow to  Turkey  from Iran
through a pipeline was cut at 2:20 a.m. today following a
“major leakage” in Turkey’s eastern Agri province, the
provincial governorate said.  Security forces found “no sign or indication that
explosives were used on the pipeline,” the Agri governorate
said in a  statement  on its website.  Energy Minister  Taner Yildiz  said earlier today that the
gas may have been cut off because of an attack by the Kurdistan
Workers’ Party, or PKK, CNN Turk television reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
