Blue Sugars Corp. (KLEG) , a U.S. producer
of cellulosic ethanol, will provide its technology to three
Brazilian sugar-cane mills by 2015 to take advantage of cheap
feedstock.  Five Brazilian ethanol producers have visited Blue Sugars’s
demonstration plant in Upton,  Wyoming , this year to evaluate the
technology, Peter Gross, chief executive officer of the Rapid
City, South Dakota-based company, said yesterday in a telephone
interview.  Producing cellulosic ethanol from crop residues is cheaper
at Brazilian sugar-cane mills than anywhere else in the world
because raw material is readily available, he said. Blue Sugars
has been studying ways to turn crushed cane stalks, called
bagasse, into fuel with Brazil’s state-controlled oil producer
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  since August 2010.  “Bagasse is available in large quantities, it’s of
consistent quality, and you don’t need to transport it,” Gross
said. “We’re very much commercially focused on  Brazil .”  Petrobras, as the oil producer is known, will install Blue
Sugars’s technology at one of its mills that will be capable of
processing 120,000 metric tons of bagasse into 10 million
gallons (37.9 million liters) of fuel a year, he said.  Blue Sugars, which yesterday changed its name from KL
Energy Corp., expects the Petrobras facility and two other
similarly sized plants to go into production in 2015, when its
technology will be competitive with ethanol produced from cane
juice. They will each cost $50 million, he said.  24,000 Gallons  Blue Sugars produced 24,000 gallons of ethanol at its U.S.
facilities last year which it shipped to Petrobras in January to
be used as fuel during the Rio+20 sustainable development summit
that concluded in Rio de Janeiro June 22, he said.  The company expects to produce 1 liter of ethanol for about
40 cents to 50 cents in 2015, he said. A liter of standard
anhydrous ethanol sells for 1.32 reais (63 cents) in Brazil now.  Brazil consumed about 29 billion liters of ethanol in 2010,
which accounted for about 6.5 percent of its energy use,
according to the  Ministry of Mines  and Energy’s 10-year energy
expansion plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
