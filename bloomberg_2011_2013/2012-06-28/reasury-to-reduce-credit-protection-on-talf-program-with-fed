The U.S. Treasury Department will
reduce the amount of credit protection it provides for the Term
Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility set up during the
financial crisis.  The  Federal Reserve ’s board of governors agreed today that
the Treasury could reduce credit protection to $1.4 billion from
$4.3 billion, according to a statement today from the Fed.  Under the program, announced in November of 2008, the Fed
lent funds to investors in highly rated asset-backed securities
and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The Fed said $71
billion was lent under the program. The Treasury department
provided credit protection on the loans through the Troubled
Asset Relief Program, known as the TARP.  “This announcement represents another important step in
winding down TARP successfully,” Timothy Massad, Treasury
assistant secretary for financial stability, said in a
statement. The program “succeeded in helping make sure American
families and businesses could still get the auto loans, consumer
loans and small business loans that they depend on every day,
and it is on track to do so without incurring any loss to the
taxpayer.”  The Fed said that most loans under the program have been
repaid or matured, and loans outstanding are down to $5.3
billion.  “To date, the program has experienced no losses and the
Board continues to see it as highly unlikely that recourse to
TARP funds will be necessary,” the Fed said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
