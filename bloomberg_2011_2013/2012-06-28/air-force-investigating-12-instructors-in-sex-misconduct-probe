The U.S.  Air Force  is investigating
12 male military training instructors for alleged sexual
misconduct with female cadets, the head of the Air Force Air
Education and Training Command said today.  General Edward Rice said the Air Force has identified 31
victims, all of whom had been trained at Lackland Air Force Base
in  San Antonio . He said nine of the 12 instructors under
investigation were from the 331st training squadron at Lackland.  The commander of that squadron was relieved of his duty
this month, Rice said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
