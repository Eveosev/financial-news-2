Cimpor-Cimentos de Portugal SGPS SA 
dropped for a seventh day to close at the lowest price in more
than three years after the Portuguese cement maker said Camargo
Correa SA doesn’t have to carry out a compulsory squeeze-out
purchase of its remaining shares.  Cimpor  declined  5.8 percent to 3.11 euros in Lisbon
trading, extending the stock’s drop this year to almost
42 percent.  “The drop today may be related to the fact that there
won’t be a compulsory squeeze-out purchase,”  Pedro Oliveira , a
trader at Go Bulling, said by e-mail today. “Investor interest
in Cimpor shares has waned.”  Camargo completed the purchase last week of more than 90
percent of Cimpor. The Portuguese company said yesterday that
Camargo’s bid didn’t meet the requirements that would have
allowed it to carry out a compulsory squeeze-out purchase of the
remaining shares.  Jose Edison, president of Camargo’s Intercement unit, said
yesterday that Camargo wouldn’t remove Cimpor from the stock
market for at least another six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
