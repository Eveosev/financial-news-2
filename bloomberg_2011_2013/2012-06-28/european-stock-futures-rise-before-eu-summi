European stocks  retreated after
Spain’s bond yields surged and  Germany ’s unemployment rate rose
more than forecast as a two-day summit of the region’s leaders
started in Brussels.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  plunged 16 percent after fines for falsifying
London interbank-offered rate submissions sparked speculation
lawsuits will follow.  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  sank 7.2 percent as the
lender issued new shares.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.5 percent to 244.67 at
the close in London, after earlier dropping as much as 1.3
percent. The benchmark measure has  fallen 10 percent from its
high in March , paring its  gain for the year to 0.1 percent , as
the euro area’s sovereign-debt crisis threatened a slowdown in
global growth. The volume of shares traded on the gauge was 9.1
percent higher than the average of the last 30 days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We expect these discussions to draw a road map for
fiscal, financial and political union, but we do not anticipate
any major decisions on concrete short-term measures to reduce
market stress beyond what has already been agreed,” wrote
Guillermo Felices and Sara Yates, strategists at Barclays in
 London , in a report to clients. “We are not alone in having
limited expectations.”  Stocks retreated as Spanish bonds declined for the fourth
day, sending the yield on  benchmark 10-year securities  to more
than 7 percent earlier today, for the first time since June 20.  German Unemployment  German unemployment  climbed in June for the fourth month
this year. The number of people out of work in Germany rose a
seasonally adjusted 7,000 to 2.88 million, the Federal Labor
Agency said. Economists had predicted an increase of 3,000,
according to the  median of 30 estimates  in a Bloomberg survey.  European Council President  Herman Van Rompuy , European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  and European Commission
President  Jose Barroso  have prepared a 10-year road map for the
euro area, which they will discuss at today’s summit.  The blueprint includes common banking supervision,  deposit
insurance  and a “criteria-based and phased” move toward joint
debt issuance. The document also suggests that the EU impose
upper limits on annual budgets and debt levels for the 17
nations that use the euro.  National benchmark indexes declined in 9 of the 18 western-
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index lost 0.6 percent,
 France ’s CAC 40 Index slid 0.4 percent and Germany’s DAX Index
retreated 1.3 percent.  Barclays Slumps  Barclays plunged 16 percent to 165.6 pence, its biggest
decline since March 2009, as a gauge of European lenders posted
the biggest drop on the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP) , losing 2.4 percent.  Chief Executive Officer  Bob Diamond  came under pressure to
resign after the  second-largest bank by assets  was fined $451
million for attempting to manipulate the inter-bank lending
rate, know as Libor.  “We expect that the cost of lawsuits related to Libor
manipulation will dwarf the fines imposed on Barclays,” said
Sandy Chen, a banks analyst at Cenkos Securities Plc in London.
“Since RBS, HSBC and LLoyds have also been named in lawsuits,
we expect they will also face significant fines and damages.”  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  declined 11 percent to
206.4 pence,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  slid 2.6 percent to 558.2 pence
and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  sank 3.9 percent to 29.94 pence.  Spanish Banks  Spanish and Italian lenders also retreated as Spanish bond
yields climbed and  Italy  paid the most to sell 10-year debt
since December at a bond auction.  Italy sold 5.42 billion euros ($6.7 billion) of five- and
10-year bonds, near the maximum 5.5 billion-euro target for the
sale. The Treasury priced the 10-year debt to yield 6.19
percent, up from 6.03 percent at the previous auction on May 30.  Bankia decreased 3.9 percent to 90 euro cents and  Banco
Popular  slid 2.6 percent to 1.69 euros in  Madrid .  Banca Monte
dei Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS)  fell 3.5 percent to 18.5 euro cents and
 Banca Popolare di Sondrio Scarl (BPSO)  lost 1.6 percent to 4.65 euros.  In Germany, Commerzbank dropped 7.2 percent to 1.26 euros
after the nation’s  second-largest lender  issued about 176.5
million euros in new shares to satisfy bonuses awarded last
year. The capital increase also strengthens the bank’s core Tier
I capital by 213.8 million euros as the Basel 3 regulatory
requirements come into force globally.  Ladbrokes, Vivendi  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  tumbled 12 percent to 152.7 pence, its
biggest slide since October 2008, after the gambling company
said a decline in online profit will be worse than predicted
because of poor gambling margins and delays to technology
upgrades. Ladbrokes said digital profit in the first half will
drop to half the amount it generated a year earlier.  Vivendi jumped 5.5 percent to 14.20 euros after people
familiar with the matter said Chief Executive Officer Jean- Bernard Levy intends to step down.  Levy, 57, plans to depart after seven years at the helm of
the Paris-based telecommunications and media company, said the
people, who asked not to be identified before an announcement.  Ageas (AGS)  jumped 9 percent to 1.47 euros after the insurer
formerly known as Fortis said it will receive a one-off payment
of 400 million euros from ABN Amro Group NV in a settlement of
legal proceedings concerning mandatory convertible securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
