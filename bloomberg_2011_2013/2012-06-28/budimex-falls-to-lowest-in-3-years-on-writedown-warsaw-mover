Budimex SA (BDX) , Poland’s largest
construction company, plunged to its lowest in more than three
years after saying it will provide for a fall in the value of a
railway building unit it bought last year.  The  shares  dropped 11 percent to 58.8 zloty, the weakest
level since March 2009, as of 10:32 a.m. in Warsaw, extending
its second-quarter slump to 31 percent. This compares with a 1.2
percent retreat in the Warsaw benchmark WIG20 index. Volume of
shares traded daily so far in the session is more than twice the
stock’s three-month average.  Budimex will write down 182.3 million zloty ($53.5 million)
for PNI sp. z o.o., it said in a regulatory statement late
yesterday. The provision, which is a result of the unit’s losses
on contracts signed before the acquisition, will reduce the
company’s 2011 earnings.  “Even though the loss will be booked in Budimex last
year’s earnings, it shows that the quality of PNI’s orders is
worse than expected,” said Andrzej Bernatowicz, an analyst at
Dom Maklerski IDM SA, who has a buy recommendation on the stock.  Budimex also decided to spend 40 million zloty raised by
PNI on the unit’s operations rather than initiate investments,
it said. The builder bought PNI last year for 225 million zloty
from the Polish railways company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
