Fitch Ratings  upgrading Turkey to
investment grade wouldn’t be a surprise, Finance Minister  Mehmet Simsek  said in an interview with Bloomberg Haberturk television
yesterday.  Turkey has maintained budget discipline, regained
investors’ confidence by keeping the  budget deficit  at half its
target and had no difficulty with the budget in the first six
months of the year, Simsek said.  Turkish debt is trading on par with countries rated seven
or eight levels higher, while AAA-rated countries are sinking,
he said.  The coming months may see a “serious” decline in
inflation, Simsek said. The cost of a revised salary agreement
with state workers will be 5 billion liras ($2.8 billion), he
added.  Speculation that an upgrade from one of the rating
companies was imminent helped to buoy Turkish bonds yesterday,
sending yields down as much as 20 basis points, the most since
March, Murat Yardimci, who heads trading at ING Bank in
Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
