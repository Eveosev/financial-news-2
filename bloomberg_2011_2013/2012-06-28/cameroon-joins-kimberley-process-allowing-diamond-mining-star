Cameroon has joined the  Kimberley
Process  on diamond certification, paving the way for output to
start at a deposit discovered four years ago, said Minister of
Mines, Industries and Technological Development Emmanuel Bonde.  “Transactions in diamonds can only be possible with
countries that are participants to the Kimberley accord,” he
said in an interview in Yaounde, the capital, on June 26.  Construction at the Mobilong site started in March by C&K
Mining Inc., a joint venture between the central African nation
and  South Korea  which has a 25-year license for the site, said
Alvine Dongoua, a communications officer at the ministry. Mining
will start in about two years, he said.  The Kimberley Process is a joint government, industry and
civil-society initiative, which tries to stem the flow of so-
called  conflict diamonds , according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
