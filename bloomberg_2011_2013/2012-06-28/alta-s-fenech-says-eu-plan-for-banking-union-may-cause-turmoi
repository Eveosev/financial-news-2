European proposals to reshape the
crisis-struck euro area, including creating a banking union, may
cause further turmoil on financial markets, said Malta’s Finance
Minister Tonio Fenech.  The 10-year road map released on June 26 by four officials
led by European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  was a “hasty
proposal” that will only “contribute to confuse and create
more market exasperation,” Fenech said in an interview in
Malta’s capital Valletta. “One must examine such proposals in
detail, as banking union is a rather grand word which will
definitely cause further turmoil on financial markets.”  Fenech also said that the proposals should have been
presented at the ministerial level before being included in the
agenda of the European leaders meeting in Brussels starting from
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
