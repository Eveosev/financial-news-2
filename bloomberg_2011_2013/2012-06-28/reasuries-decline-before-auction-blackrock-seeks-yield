Treasuries advanced for a second day
amid speculation European leaders at a two-day summit in
Brussels will fail to agree on a strategy to contain the euro
bloc’s debt crisis.  Benchmark  10-year notes  extended a quarterly gain as U.S.
data confirmed growth in the world’s largest economy slowed in
the first quarter. The Treasury will sell $29 billion of seven-
year debt today, the third of three note auctions this week
totaling $99 billion. European Union leaders are struggling over
how to safeguard governments in Spain and  Italy  and keep
financial turmoil from spreading.  “The bar is very low, and no one expects anything to come
out of the summit that will be enforceable or lasting,” said
Tom Tucci, managing director and head of Treasury trading in New
York at CIBC World Markets Corp. “There’s no silver bullet.
They’re in a situation where they have no answers.”  The 10-year yield dropped four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.57 percent at 11:46 a.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It was the lowest
level since June 19. The 1.75 percent note due in May 2022
gained 13/32, or $4.06 per $1,000-face amount, to 101 19/32. The
yield has dropped 64 basis points since the end of March.  Current  five-year note  yields fell three basis points to
0.68 percent.  A valuation measure showed 10-year notes trading at almost
the most expensive level ever. The term premium, a model created
by economists at the Fed, was at negative 0.91 percent, after
reaching a record negative 0.94 percent June 1 as investors
sought refuge from  Europe ’s debt turmoil.  A negative reading indicates investors are willing to
accept yields below what’s considered fair value. The average
over the past decade is 0.50 percent.  Note Auction  The seven-year Treasury notes being auctioned today yielded
1.063 percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 1.203
percent at the previous sale on May 24, which was the  lowest  on
record. Bids are due at 1 p.m.  Investors  bid  for 2.8 times the amount of debt available
last month, a figure called the bid-to-cover ratio, versus 2.83
times in April. The average for the past 10 auctions is 2.84.
Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes foreign
central banks, bought 42.7 percent of the notes at the May sale,
versus an average of 40.6 percent for the past 10 offerings.  “We should see better demand, aided by the continuation of
Twist, with the Fed purchasing 32 percent in this sector,”
Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald
LP in  New York , wrote in a note to clients. The firm is one of
the central bank’s 21 primary dealers, which are obligated to
participate in Treasury auctions.  Operation Twist  The Fed’s Operation Twist program replaces short-term debt
in the central bank’s holdings with longer-term Treasuries to
extend the average maturity. Policy makers last week expanded it
to $667 billion and extended it to year-end.  The central bank sold $8.63 billion of Treasuries today due
from November 2014 to June 2015 today as part of the effort to
put downward pressure on  interest rates  and ease conditions in
financial markets.  Demand at the Treasury’s other two note sales this week was
lower than average. The bid-to-cover ratio at the $35 billion
sale of five-year debt yesterday was 2.61, versus an average of
2.97 at the past 10 offerings. A sale of the same amount of two-
year securities on June 26 had a ratio of 3.62, versus 3.95 at
the previous sale and an average 3.71 at the past 10.  The  U.S. Treasury  has sold $1.046 trillion in notes and
bonds this year as the Obama administration finances a fourth-
straight deficit exceeding $1 trillion.  Bond Returns  U.S. government securities have returned 1.9 percent this
year, compared with a 2.3 percent gain by global sovereign debt
and a 4.9 percent advance by global corporate bonds, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Treasuries have swung between gains and losses for a week
as investors waited for the European summit.  Volatility declined for an eighth day yesterday, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE index . The gauge fell to
70.2 basis points, the lowest level since May 29. The index
measures price swings based on options.  Angela Merkel ,  Germany ’s chancellor, is increasingly
isolated as French President  Francois Hollande , Italian Prime
Minister  Mario Monti  and Spanish Premier  Mariano Rajoy  unite to
push for quicker action to ease the crisis that emerged in
 Greece  in 2009. Merkel rejected calls to do more to cut their
borrowing costs.  ‘Same Story’  “It’s a different day, but the same story,” said Paul Horrmann, a broker in New York at Tradition Asiel Securities
Inc., an interdealer broker. “Our domestic picture isn’t that
bad, but it is being ruled by outside forces that we cannot
control. With little domestic data to drive us, we are in the
perfect storm for headlines to whip us around.”  U.S. government securities have returned 3.2 percent this
quarter, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data, amid
concern Europe’s crisis is worsening. That’s the most since the
third quarter of last year. They returned 9.8 percent in 2011.  Treasuries remained higher today as Commerce Department
data showed U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 1.9
percent annual pace last quarter, matching the government’s
previous estimate, Commerce Department data showed. Growth
slowed from 3 percent in the final three months of last year.  The number of initial claims for  unemployment benefits  in
the U.S. decreased by 6,000 to 386,000 in the week ended June
23, in line with the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News, Labor Department data showed today. The prior
week’s reading was revised up to 392,000 from 387,000, matching
an April figure as the steepest of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
