Don Larsen  is selling the  New York
Yankees ’ uniform he wore while pitching the only perfect game in
World Series history.  Larsen, 82, said today at a news conference in New York
that he will auction off the jersey and pants from Game 5 of
baseball’s 1956 Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers through
Steiner Sports Memorabilia. The sale will be held over 56 days
from October through December to commemorate the 56th
anniversary of the game.  Larsen and the Yankees beat the Dodgers 2-0 at Yankee
Stadium on Oct. 8, 1956, with the right-hander retiring all 27
batters he faced. The Yankees won the Series in seven games.  No anticipated price for the uniform was listed at the news
conference or in a news release from Steiner Sports. A jersey
used by Hall of Fame outfielder  Babe Ruth  recently sold for $4.4
million, while a jersey from  Yogi Berra , a Hall of Fame catcher
for the Yankees who caught Larsen’s perfect game, has sold for
$600,000.  “There are some crazy people out there, and you’ll have to
have a lot of money to buy it,” Steiner said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
