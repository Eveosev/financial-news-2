Russia’s farmers are expected to
harvest 84.5 million metric tons of grains in the 2012-13
season, which starts July 1, said the Institute for Agricultural
Market Studies, which cut an earlier forecast.  That compares with an estimate of 88.4 million tons made
earlier in June. Russia’s wheat crop forecast was lowered 5.8
percent to 48.5 million tons, Oleg Sukhanov, head of market
analysis at the institute known as Ikar, said by phone in Moscow
today.  Grain exports are expected to be 17.5 million tons,
including 13.5 million to 13.8 million tons of wheat, according
to Ikar. The institute had previously forecast total exports of
19 million tons, with 15 million tons of wheat.  The crops have been affected by weather conditions
including a lack of moisture in the spring and frosts in the
winter, according to Ikar.  Winter wheat is light in weight in the regions that were
hit by the spring drought, said Sukhanov, who has just returned
from a crop tour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
