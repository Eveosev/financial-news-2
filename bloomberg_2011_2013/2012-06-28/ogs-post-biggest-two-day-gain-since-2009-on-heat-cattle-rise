Hog prices marked the biggest two-
day gain since 2009 on speculation that hot weather will
restrict movement of animals, limiting the amount available to
slaughterhouses. Cattle also rose.  Temperatures in the U.S. Midwest may top 100 degrees
Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) today, AccuWeather Inc. said.
Farmers will keep hogs indoors and not move them to prevent
illness and weight loss during unusually hot weather,  Dennis Smith , a senior account executive at Archer Financial Services
Inc., said by telephone.  “It’s easier to keep them in the barns and keep them cool
than move them in the heat,” Smith said. “That’s why you’re
seeing some unexpected strength in prices.”  Hog futures for August settlement surged 2.4 percent to
settle at 93.9 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile
Exchange. The price gained 5.5 percent in two sessions, the most
since Oct. 8, 2009.  Cattle futures for August delivery advanced 1.8 percent to
$1.19325 a pound in Chicago, the biggest gain since May 3. The
price of wholesale beef rose 0.8 percent in the previous two
days, indicating higher demand,  Jason Britt , the president of
brokerage Central States Commodities Inc. in  Kansas City ,
 Missouri , said by telephone.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 1.1
percent to $1.5045 a pound on the CME, also the biggest increase
since May 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
