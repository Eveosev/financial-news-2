Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said the country’s lenders have enough capital for
acquisitions.  Asked about the possibility of a Canadian lender buying an
Irish bank, Flaherty said “some Canadian banks have made
acquisitions in Asia and the U.S.” adding “there is no reason
why they can’t make investments elsewhere so long as they
maintain adequate capital.”  Flaherty said Canada supervises its banks “quite closely,
including their capital requirements.” He said that new
international rules -- the so-called Basel III regulations --
have increased both the “quality and quantity of the capital”
lenders are required to hold.  Flaherty made the comments to reporters in Galway, Ireland,
following a  presentation  at a conference today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
