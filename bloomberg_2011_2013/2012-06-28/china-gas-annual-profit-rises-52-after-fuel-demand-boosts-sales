China Gas Holdings Ltd. (384) , the target
of a $2 billion hostile bid from  ENN Energy Holdings Ltd. (2688)  and
 China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , posted a 52 percent increase
in annual profit, beating estimates, after sales gained.  Net income in the 12 months ended March 31 climbed to
HK$954 million ($123 million), or 20.55 cents a share, from
HK$626 million, or 14.6 cents, a year earlier, China Gas said in
a Hong Kong stock exchange filing today. The average estimate of
11 analysts compiled by Bloomberg was a profit of HK$946
million. Revenue rose 19 percent to HK$18.9 billion.  Higher profit and rising demand for cleaner-burning natural
gas may intensify the battle for control of China Gas, a seller
of subsidized fuel in canisters and pipelines. The stock has
gained 36 percent since the ENN-led bid on Dec. 13 as some of
the companyâ€™s biggest shareholders increased their holdings.  China Gas shares fell 1.6 percent to HK$3.81 before the
earnings announcement. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  declined
0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
