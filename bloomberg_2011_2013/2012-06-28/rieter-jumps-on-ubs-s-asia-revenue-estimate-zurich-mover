Rieter Holding AG (RIEN) , a Swiss maker of
textile machinery, rose the most in more than three weeks after
UBS AG raised its recommendation on the stock, citing benefits
of growth in  Asia  that may boost earnings starting in 2014.  Rieter jumped as much as 5.9 percent to 132.70 Swiss
francs, the biggest intraday gain since June 6, and was trading
up 3 percent at 11:48 a.m. in Zurich.  Investors haven’t been considering how Winterthur-based
Rieter’s spending plans on information technology and
development of mid-range textile machinery for Asian markets
will help earnings, Andre Rudolf von Rohr, a Zurich-based
analyst at UBS, said in a research report. Growth in Asia may
generate 75 million francs ($77.6 million) to 150 million francs
in extra sales, he said.  “It seems that the market has treated the 140 million-
franc investments almost like costs without any potential
upside,” wrote Rudolf von Rohr, who increased his
 recommendation  to buy from neutral. UBS kept estimates for
Rieter’s 2012 sales and earnings unchanged.  Competing Swiss textile machinery maker  OC Oerlikon Corp AG (OERL) 
said April 30 that demand in  China  was stable after orders
peaked at the end of 2010 and beginning of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
