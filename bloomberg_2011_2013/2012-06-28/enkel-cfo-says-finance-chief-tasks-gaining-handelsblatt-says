Henkel AGâ€™s outgoing Chief Financial
Officer Lothar Steinebach said the importance of his role is
continuing to grow in modern businesses,  Handelsblatt  reported,
citing an interview.  Finance departments no longer simply identify and address
under-performing sectors, they monitor raw material costs, urge
sales departments to raise prices accordingly and evaluate risks
in industrial pricing, he told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
