Poland’s zloty declined for a second
day as reports showed economic conditions in the euro area, the
country’s biggest export market, worsened while European leaders
gathered in Brussels to discuss ways to stem the debt crisis.  The zloty lost 0.8 percent to 4.2861 per euro as of 12:03
p.m. in Warsaw, the steepest drop among more than 20 emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Economic confidence in the euro area slumped to the lowest
in more than 2 1/2 years in June, the European Commission said
today. The Ifo economic research institute said  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis will damp  Germany ’s economic performance
this year and a report showed unemployment in the nation climbed
in June for the fourth month this year.  Euro-area finance ministers set the stage for today’s
gathering in Brussels of the European Union’s 27 chiefs,
approving Cyprus’s bailout and detailing how they would aid
Spanish banks. Consensus breaks down on safeguarding governments
in Spain and Italy, with German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
rejecting calls to do more to cut their borrowing costs.  “We think that the road map for coming out of the crisis
will be full of holes,”  Rafal Benecki  and Grzegorz Ogonek,
economists at ING Groep NV’s Polish unit, wrote in an e-mailed
note. “This won’t bring optimism to financial markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
