Banco do Brasil SA , Banco  Itau
Unibanco (ITUB)  SA and six other Brazilian financial institutions were
downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service today as part of a
global review of banks rated higher than their home countries.  The standalone bank financial strength ratings or baseline
credit assessments of eight institutions was lowered by one to
three levels, concluding reviews that Moody’s announced on Feb.
24 and March 15, the ratings company said in a statement.  Last week, markets responded to Moody’s downgrade of 15 of
the world’s largest banks by bidding up the value of their
stocks and bonds. The prospect of downgrades had weighed on
banks since the company said on Feb. 15 that it was reviewing 17
financial firms with capital-markets operations because of
fragile confidence and tighter regulations that pinched revenue.  Banco do Brasil, the country’s largest bank, was lowered
three grades to Baa2, or the sovereign rating, putting it two
levels above junk. Itau Unibanco, the second-largest, and  Banco
Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , ranked No. 3, were each cut by three levels to
Baa1, above the nation’s rating.  Banco Safra SA, Banco Santander Brasil and HSBC Bank Brasil
were the other banks lowered to Baa2. Banco Itau BBA SA was cut
to Baa1 and Banco Votorantim SA was cut to one level below the
sovereign rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
