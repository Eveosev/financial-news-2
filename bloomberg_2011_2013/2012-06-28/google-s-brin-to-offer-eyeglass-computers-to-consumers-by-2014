Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the world’s
most popular search engine, will sell eyeglass-embedded
computers to consumers by 2014 after incorporating feedback from
developers, said  Sergey Brin , the company’s co-founder.  Project Glass test devices with software and cameras, to
give quick access to information in a display above the eyes,
will be offered for $1,500 to developers who attend Google’s I/O
developers conference in San Francisco and will ship in early
2013. The  Mountain View , California-based company is sharing the
design with developers to benefit from their work, Brin said in
an interview.  “These explorer editions I’d like to get out early next
year,” Brin told Jon Erlichman on Bloomberg TV’s “Rewind”
yesterday. “And within a year after that I want to have a broad
consumer offering.”  Brin showed a  demonstration  of Project Glass featuring
skydivers wearing the glasses, which sent live video to the
conference. The Google X lab that produced Project Glass is also
working on other technology, including self-driving cars.  “With Google X I’m not really thinking about any sort of
existing products or things to compare it to,” Brin said.
“Google X is about brand new risky technological things that
are sort of making science fiction real.”  Google also made another move into the hardware market at
the conference yesterday, showing its $199 Nexus 7 tablet to
take on  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)   To contact the reporters on this story:
