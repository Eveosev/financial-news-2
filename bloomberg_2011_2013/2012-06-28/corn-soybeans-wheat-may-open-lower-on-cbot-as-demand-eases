What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets on the Chicago Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
lower as U.S. export demand eases following a 14 percent rally
this month, Jacquie Voeks, senior market adviser at the Stewart-
Peterson Group in West Bend,  Wisconsin . Domestic use of the
grain to make ethanol also may ebb, she said.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower on
speculation that demand for biofuels made from the oilseed will
drop after crude-oil prices slumped to the lowest in eight
months, Voeks said.  -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower as
rain boosts yield prospects in the northern U.S. Great Plains
and  Canada , Voeks said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
