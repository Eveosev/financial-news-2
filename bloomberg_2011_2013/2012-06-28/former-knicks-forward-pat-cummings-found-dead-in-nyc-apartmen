Pat Cummings, who played with the
 New York Knicks  in the 1980s, was found dead in his New York
apartment, according to the Medical Examiner’s office. He was
55.  A cause of death has yet to be determined. Foul play wasn’t
suspected, according to a statement from the office.  The 6-foot-9 Cummings, a native of Johnstown, Pennsylvania,
played forward and center for five teams in the  National
Basketball Association  over 12 seasons, from 1979-80 to 1990-91.  A two-time All-Metro Conference selection while at the
 University of Cincinnati , Cummings was the conference Player of
the Year as a senior. His .642 shooting percentage that season
remains a school record.  He was  drafted by Milwaukee  in the third round in 1978 but
completed his college eligibility. He played his first three NBA
seasons with the Bucks.  “Pat was obviously a great shooter and made a big impact
as one of the best players in the history of our program,”
Cincinnati coach Mick Cronin said in a statement on the school’s
website. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and
friends.”  Cummings was signed by the Knicks as a free agent in 1984.
Playing alongside forward Bernard King in his first of four
seasons in New York, the 6-foot-9 Cummings averaged 15.8 points
per game in 1984-85. He averaged 15.7 points the next season
playing with rookie  Patrick Ewing .  Over his NBA career, Cummings averaged 9.6 points and 5.6
rebounds. He also played for  Dallas , Miami and  Utah .  To contact the reporter on this story:
