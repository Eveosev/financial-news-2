AOL Inc. (AOL) , the New York-based Web
portal, has started a $400 million stock repurchase as part of a
plan to return funds to shareholders from a $1.1 billion patent
sale.  The company is buying the stock using a so-called Dutch
auction tender offer, AOL said today in a statement. The deal
brings the total amount that AOL plans to return to shareholders
this year to $1.1 billion.  AOL, facing a slump in sales, agreed in April to sell and
license patents to  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  The Internet company is
selling more than 800 patents and related applications to
Microsoft and will grant the software maker a nonexclusive
license to its retained patent portfolio. AOL still holds more
than 300 patents and applications following the transaction.  The move helped propel AOLâ€™s stock price this year,
contributing to a 81 percent gain in 2012. The shares were
little changed yesterday, closing at $27.31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
