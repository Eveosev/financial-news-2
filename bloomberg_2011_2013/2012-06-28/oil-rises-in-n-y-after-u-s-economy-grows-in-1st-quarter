Oil rose in  New York  after a report
showed the  U.S. economy  grew 1.9 percent in the first quarter,
reflecting a gain in  consumer spending .  Futures advanced as much as 0.8 percent after the Commerce
Department in Washington said the revised gross domestic product
reading matched the increase previously calculated by the
government. Crude fell earlier as the European Commission said
economic confidence in the euro area slumped to the lowest in
more than 2 1/2 years in June and Germany reported that
unemployment rose for a fourth month this year.  “The U.S. seems to be the one country who can pull us out
of the mud,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at
Saxo Bank A/S in Copenhagen. “The market is confused as we have
two forces pulling the market in either direction.”  Oil for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
gained as much as 63 cents to $80.84 a barrel and was at $80.68
at 1:53 p.m. London time. The contract earlier fell 46 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $79.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
