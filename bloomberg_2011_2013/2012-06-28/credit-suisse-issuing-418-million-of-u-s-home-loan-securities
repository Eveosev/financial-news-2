Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  is issuing
$417.7 million of securities backed by prime jumbo mortgages,
according to  Standard & Poor’s .  Some of the underlying loans were acquired in bulk from
MetLife Inc. while others were bought individually, the New
York-based ratings company said today in statement. S&P granted
top grades to $390 million of the bonds.  Credit Suisse teamed with  Chimera Investment Corp. (CIM) , the New
York-based real estate investment trust, on a $730 million deal
in March. The name of the latest offering also contains the
letters CIM, matching the REIT’s stock ticker.  Redwood Trust
Inc. (RWT) , which has been planning a deal with $293.6 million of
jumbo mortgages, is the only other issuer of securities tied to
new U.S. home loans without government backing since the market
froze in 2008.  Previous offerings totaled less than $3 billion, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg, compared with issuance of about
$1.2 trillion in each of 2005 and 2006. Government-supported
programs and demand from banks for loans are limiting the
market’s revival after a collapse in the prices of outstanding
securities as foreclosures soared and home values tumbled.  Steven Vames, a spokesman in New York for Credit Suisse,
declined to immediately comment.  Jay Diamond , a spokesman for
Chimera, didn’t immediately return an e-mailed message.  Jumbo home loans are larger than allowed in government-
supported programs, currently as much as $729,750 for single-
family properties in some areas. Limits range from $417,000 to
$625,500 for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans with the lowest
costs for borrowers using 20 percent down payments.  To contact the reporters on this story:
