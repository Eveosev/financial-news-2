U.S. stocks and the euro pared
losses amid speculation that European leaders were nearing an
agreement on plans to halt contagion from the debt crisis.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent to
1,329.01 at 4 p.m. in  New York  after earlier slumping as much as
1.4 percent. The euro slipped less than 0.2 percent to $1.2447
after earlier dropping as much as 0.5 percent.  Italy and Spain may get short-term relief to ease financing
pressure, Xinhua reported, citing a European Union source at the
summit in Brussels. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  canceled a
press briefing at the summit and her spokesman said talks on a
growth accord were ongoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
