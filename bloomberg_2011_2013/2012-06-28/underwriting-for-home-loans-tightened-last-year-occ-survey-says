Loan underwriting standards for some
commercial and retail products eased over the past year as banks
responded to changes in economic outlook, competition and risk
appetite, according to a U.S. government survey.  Underwriting tightened somewhat for high loan-to-value  home
equity , international, construction and residential real estate
loans, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said today
in its annual survey of credit underwriting at 87 of the largest
lenders.  Industry standards for $4.6 trillion in loans reviewed were
largely unchanged from the previous year, with the biggest banks
easing standards on credit cards and corporate loans, according
to the survey. Residential mortgage standards were tightened at
25 percent of banks while previous tightening of business-
banking practices lessened, with 82 percent of banks saying they
went unchanged since the year before.  “This year’s survey showed the continued normal
progression toward stable or easing underwriting standards as
the economic environment stabilizes,” said John Lyons, the
OCC’s senior deputy comptroller and chief national bank
examiner. “Examiners will be focusing on underwriting standards
as banks ease standards to improve margins and compete for
limited good loans.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
