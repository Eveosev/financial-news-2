Commodities fell the most in a week
on skepticism that European Union leaders will make progress on
the debt crisis and after a report showed U.S. jobless claims
hovered near the highest level of the year.  The S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw materials dropped, led by
declines in energy and metals, as 27 European government chiefs
met in a two-day summit to focus on immediate financial help for
Spain and Italy. The U.S. Labor Department said applications for
 unemployment benefits  were 386,000 in the week ended June 23.  “We’re not getting a lot of good news with the economy,”
said  Dan Flynn , a trader at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  The S&P GSCI dropped 1.7 percent to 567.47 after earlier
touching 565.5. Eighteen of the commodities fell, led by silver,
crude oil and natural gas.  The euro fell as much as 0.5 percent to $1.2407, the lowest
level since May 31. It was down 0.2 percent to $1.2445 at 4:01
p.m. in New York.  Crude oil for August delivery fell $2.52, or 3.1 percent,
to settle at $77.69 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest price since Oct. 4. Brent for August
settlement decreased $2.14, or 2.3 percent, to $91.36 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Silver futures for September delivery slumped 2.6 percent
to $26.291 an ounce on the Comex, after touching $26.105, the
lowest since Nov. 18, 2010.  Natural gas for August delivery fell 7.6 cents, or 2.7
percent, to settle at $2.722 per million British thermal units
in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
