Treasuries rose as demand for a
refuge from  Europe ’s financial turmoil pushed yields to a record
low at the U.S. government’s auction of $29 billion in seven-
year notes for a third consecutive month.  Ten-year note yields dropped to the lowest in more than a
week as European Union leaders began a debt-crisis summit. The
seven-year note sale drew a  yield  of 1.075 percent, compared
with the average forecast of 1.056 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of eight of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers. The
bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the amount
bid with the amount offered, was 2.64, the lowest since October.  “Clearly there are concerns about Europe, which set
Treasuries on a positive path,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief
global strategist at the broker-dealer BTIG LLC in New York.
“Until we get clarifying headlines out of Europe that say
otherwise, that trend will continue. We’ve seen no reason to
sell off.”  The yield on the current  seven-year  note fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.04 percent at 5:01 p.m.
in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They
touched the lowest ever, 0.91 percent, in trading on June 1.  The benchmark 10-year note yield dropped four basis points
to 1.58 percent and touched 1.57 percent, the lowest level since
June 19. It reached a record low 1.44 percent on June 1.  Thirty-year bond  yields trimmed gains as EU President
 Herman Van Rompuy  said leaders have agreed to spend 120 billion
euros ($149 billion) to stimulate growth and create jobs. He
spoke at a press conference during the summit. The yields were
down two basis points to 2.68 percent after falling earlier to
2.65 percent.  Bill Rates  The  rate  on the 30-day Treasury bill dropped to zero for
the first time since March.  The last sale of seven-year debt, on May 24, drew a then-
record low of 1.203 percent after a 1.347 percent yield at the
April auction.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 42 percent of the notes today, compared
with an average of 40.6 percent for the past 10 sales. Direct
bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place their bids
directly with the Treasury, bought 6.5 percent, versus an
average of 14.3 percent for the past 10 auctions.  The auction’s  bid-to-cover  ratio trailed the 2.84 average
at the past 10 sales.  “It wasn’t particularly very good, but it hasn’t been the
best week for the Treasury,” BTIG’s Greenhaus said. “Let’s not
lose sight of the fact that yields are incredibly low.”  Below Average  The Treasury auctioned $99 billion in notes at three
offerings this week, drawing lower-than-average demand at each.
The bid-to-cover  ratio  at the $35 billion sale of five-year debt
yesterday was 2.61, versus an average of 2.97 at the past 10
offerings. An auction of the same amount of two-year securities
on June 26 had a  ratio  of 3.62, versus 3.95 at the May offering
and an average 3.71 at the past 10.  The U.S. has sold $1.046 trillion in notes and bonds this
year as President  Barack Obama ’s administration finances a
fourth-straight deficit exceeding $1 trillion.  A valuation measure showed 10-year notes trading at almost
the most expensive level ever. The term premium, a model created
by economists at the Fed, was at negative 0.90 percent, after
reaching a record negative 0.94 percent June 1 as investors
sought refuge from Europe’s debt turmoil.  A negative reading indicates investors are willing to
accept yields below what’s considered fair value. The average
over the past decade is 0.50 percent.  Treasuries have returned 3.2 percent this quarter,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data, amid concern
Europe’s crisis is worsening. That’s the most since the third
quarter of last year. They gained 9.8 percent in 2011.  Global Returns  U.S. government securities have returned 1.9 percent this
year, compared with a 2.3 percent gain by global sovereign debt
and a 4.9 percent advance by global corporate bonds, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Ten-year notes extended a quarterly gain today as a report
confirmed U.S. economic growth slowed in the first quarter and
EU leaders met for the first day of their summit in Brussels.  Treasuries have swung between gains and losses for a week
as investors waited for the summit. European leaders are
struggling to reach an agreement on how to safeguard governments
in Spain and  Italy , with German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
rejecting calls to do more to cut their borrowing costs.  “The bar is very low, and no one expects anything to come
out of the summit that will be enforceable or lasting,” said
Tom Tucci, managing director and head of Treasury trading in New
York at CIBC World Markets Corp. “There’s no silver bullet.
They’re in a situation where they have no answers.”  Operation Twist  The Fed sold $8.63 billion of Treasuries today due from
November 2014 to June 2015 as part of its Operation Twist
program to put downward pressure on  interest rates  and ease
conditions in financial markets.  Operation Twist replaces short-term debt in the central
bank’s holdings with longer-term Treasuries to extend the
average maturity. Policy makers last week expanded the program
to $667 billion and extended it to year-end.  U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 1.9 percent
annual pace last quarter, meeting the government’s previous
estimate, Commerce Department data showed. Growth slowed from 3
percent in the last three months of last year.  Deflation Chances  Longer-term deflation probabilities increased slightly this
week, according to the Fed Bank of Atlanta. Estimates derived
from Treasury Inflation Protected Securities markets show the
probability of deflation over five years starting in 2012 was 16
percent yesterday, versus 15 percent the week before, according
to the bank’s Inflation Project. The chance for 2011-2016
remained at 14 percent.  A  measure  of price-increase predictions used by the central
bank to set policy, the five-year, five-year forward break-even
rate, which gauges average inflation between 2017 and 2022,
declined to 2.48 percent on June 25, down from a 2012 high of
2.78 percent on March 19. It touched 3.23 percent in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
