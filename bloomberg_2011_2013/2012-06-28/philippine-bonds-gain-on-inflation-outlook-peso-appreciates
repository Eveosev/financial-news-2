Philippine bonds gained after the
central bank said inflation remains manageable, helping support
demand for fixed-income securities. The peso rose for a third
day.  The yield dropped to its lowest level in eight weeks after
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco said
yesterday inflation may be at 2.5 percent to 3.4 percent this
month as price increases for utilities and some vegetables are
offset by lower oil costs. Moody’s Investors Service upgraded
the nation’s rating outlook in May to positive, citing improving
debt levels.  “The outlook is good because inflation is within
manageable levels,” said Speedy Delfino, a fixed-income trader
at East West Bank Corp. in  Manila . “There’s also the chance of
an upgrade.”  The yield on the government’s 7.375 percent bonds due March
2021 fell nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 5.285
percent, according to prices from Tradition Financial Services.
That’s the lowest level since May 2.  Consumer-price increases slowed to 2.9 percent in May from
3 percent the previous month, official figures show. The
government is due to report June data on July 5.  The peso climbed before the start of a summit on  Europe ’s
debt crisis. The currency advanced 0.1 percent to 42.34 per
dollar in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
touched 42.215 today, the strongest level since June 21. It
strengthened 1.3 percent this quarter, the most among  Asia ’s 10
most-used currencies excluding the yen.  One-month implied volatility for the peso, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined 21 basis
points, 0.21 percentage point, to 6.09 percent.  To contact the reporter for this story:
