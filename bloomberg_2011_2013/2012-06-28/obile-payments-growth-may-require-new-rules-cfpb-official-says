The U.S. government may need to
develop rules to keep pace with rising use of mobile-payment
systems, a Consumer Financial Protection bureau official told
lawmakers in a statement prepared for a hearing tomorrow.  “To the extent that technology companies begin to play
roles traditionally performed by banking institutions, we may
need to reconsider how well our existing regulations apply to a
changed environment,” Marla Blow, the bureau’s assistant
director for card and payment markets, said in a written
statement for a House Financial Services subcommittee.  The panel is holding the hearing to weigh how the goverment
should regulate mobile payments, transactions conducted via
smartphones or other portable devices. Blow said the bureau will
be “flexible and responsive” to the changing marketplace,
which she described as beneficial to consumers.  “Innovation can be greatly advantageous to consumers,
offering new tools for people to better control their own
finances and plan their own lives,” Blow said. “The
connectivity and computing power of a modern smartphone could be
used to develop rich applications that provide better services
at lower costs.”  Blow said risks to consumers could stem from “the very
nature of mobile payments,” which aren’t yet widespread in the
U.S. For example, small mobile device screens complicate
disclosure of terms and conditions, which are in any case
“frequently bypassed with a single click,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
