OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s biggest
company by market value, slid for the first time in three days
after its chief financial officer said earnings may drop this
year.  Gazprom, the country’s natural-gas export monopoly, fell
2.1 percent to 150.69 rubles by the close in Moscow. The stock
has lost 17 percent this quarter.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization may decline to $58 billion this year from $66
billion last year as the government raises extraction taxes,
Andrey Kruglov told reporters today in Moscow.  Russia’s  Finance Ministry  will re-examine the proposed
rates of gas tax increases in August, Deputy Finance Sergei Shatalov said today in an interview in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
