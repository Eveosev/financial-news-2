Komercni Banka  AS, the Czech unit of
Societe Generale SA, snapped two days of gains as German data
showed unemployment in Europe’s largest economy increased,
damping prospects for the continent’s economic recovery.  The stock dropped 0.8 percent to 3,450 koruna by 3:52 p.m.
in Prague, after a 2.9 percent rally in the previous two days.
The 14-member PX equity index, in which Komercni Banka has an 18
percent weighting, declined 0.9 percent.  Lenders led European shares lower after the Nuremberg-based
Federal Labor Agency said unemployment in Germany, the biggest
buyer of Czech exports, rose more than expected in June.
European leaders are meeting today in an effort to contain the
financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
