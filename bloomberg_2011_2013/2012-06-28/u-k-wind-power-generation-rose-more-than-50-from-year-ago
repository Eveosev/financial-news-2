U.K. electricity generated from wind
rose by at least 50 percent in the past year as the nation spurs
clean power to become energy self-sufficient and curb pollution.  Onshore output gained 51 percent to 3.6 terawatt-hours in
the first quarter from a year earlier as turbines were added,
the Department of Energy and Climate Change said today in a
statement. Offshore wind expanded 50 percent. The share of
electricity generated from all renewable sources increased to
11.1 percent of the total from 7.7 percent.  Britain plans to install 31 gigawatts of wind capacity by
2020 from 6.6 gigawatts now as it chases a goal of getting 15
percent of its energy from renewables by the end of the decade.
SSE Plc and Renewable Energy Systems Ltd. are among those that
commissioned U.K. turbines on land or at sea in the past year.  The U.K.â€™s wind fleet produced enough power for more than 6
million homes in the first quarter, based on department data,
industry lobby RenewableUK said in a separate statement.  Scotland , seeking to get all its electricity from clean
sources by 2020, said renewable generation rose 44.3 percent to
a record of 13,735 gigawatt-hours in 2011 compared with 2010.  Cleanly sourced generation in the first quarter rose 45.5
percent to 4,590 gigawatt-hours from a year ago, the Scottish
government said today in a separate statement sent by e-mail.  Scotland got about 35 percent of its electricity from
renewables in 2011, according to the government.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
