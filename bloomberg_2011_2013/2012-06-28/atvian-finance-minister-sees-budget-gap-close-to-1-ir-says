Latvia’s budget deficit this year
will be closer to 1 percent of economic output rather than 2
percent should gross domestic product increase by at least 3
percent in the second half of the year, Finance Minister Andris
Vilks said in an interview published today in the magazine Ir.  The Baltic nation’s economy expanded 6.9 percent in the
first quarter from the same period a year ago. The government
originally targeted a shortfall of 2.5 percent of GDP this year.
Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis was quoted by the BNS news
service on May 15 as saying the gap will be 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
