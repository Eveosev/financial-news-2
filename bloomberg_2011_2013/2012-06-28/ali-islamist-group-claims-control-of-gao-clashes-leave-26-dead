Islamist fighters in  Mali  claimed
control of the city of Gao following clashes with Touareg
separatists that left at least 26 dead.  Fighters from the Touareg group, the National Movement for
the Liberation of Azawad or MNLA, were “chased” out of the
northern city because “they were firing at civilians,” Oumar
Hamaha, chief of operations of Ansar ud-Din, said by phone
today.  “We are controlling the city now,” he said, adding that
apart from at least 26 fighters killed on both sides, 19 others
were injured. At least 41 people with bullet wounds are
receiving treatment at the hospital in Gao, the International
Committee of the Red Cross said today in an e-mailed statement.  In April, Touareg separatists seized the north of Mali with
the help of Islamist rebels seeking to impose Shariah law in the
region. Ansar ud-Din, which means “Defenders of the Faith,”
collaborated with the smaller MUJAO in the recent fighting
against MNLA, residents said yesterday.  The tomb of Askia near the city of Gao, which is on the
United Nations list of world heritage sites, is in danger from
the fighting, according to a statement on the website of the UN
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.  The Islamists have barred all cars and trucks from entering
Gao, Issa Idrissa, a resident, said by phone. “It looks like
they have sent troop reinforcements,” he said.  Calls made to the mobile phone of Attaye Ag Mohamed, a
spokesman for the MNLA, didn’t connect today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
