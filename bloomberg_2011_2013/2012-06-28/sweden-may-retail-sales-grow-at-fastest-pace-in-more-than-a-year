Swedish  retail sales  grew at the
fastest pace in more than a year in May as confidence among
consumers in the export-dependent Nordic economy remained
buoyant amid the  European debt crisis .  Sales growth accelerated to an annual 4.6 percent last
month after rising 0.5 percent in April, Stockholm-based
 Statistics Sweden  said today. The  median estimate  in a survey of
nine economists by Bloomberg was for a 3.8 percent increase.
Monthly retail sales rose 0.4 percent in May.  Swedish  unemployment  unexpectedly rose to 8.1 percent in
May, the highest in a year, after  industrial production  slumped
for a fifth time in six months by 6.2 percent the previous month
compared with the same period a year ago.  Sweden , which relies on sales abroad for about half of its
output, sends 70 percent of its  exports  to  Europe . Growth in the
largest Nordic economy will slow to 0.7 percent this year from
3.9 percent in 2011, the National Institute for  Economic
Research  predicted on June 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
