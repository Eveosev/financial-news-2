Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened
after Flint Hills Resources LLC shut a hydrocracker at its
Corpus Christi refinery in  Texas .  The 305,000-barrel-a-day refinery flared gases yesterday as
the unit was brought down after a leak was discovered in a heat
exchanger, according to a filing with the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast rose 0.25 cent to 7 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:57 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slipped
1.55 cents to $2.5509 a gallon.  Petroleos de Venezuela SA’s Amuay refinery in Falcon state
is operating after an incident at a treatment plant, a company
offical, who isn’t authorized to speak publicly, said today in a
telephone interview.  The refinery was never halted because of the incident, the
official said, without providing additional details.  Reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in  New York  Harbor fell
0.25 cent to 6.75 cents a gallon versus futures. Stocks of
reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, rose a second week on the East
Coast, climbing 537,000 barrels to 17.2 million last week,
Energy Department data show.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago  widened 1.25 cents to 7 cents a gallon. The same fuel in
the Midwest, or Group 3, weakened 6 cents to a discount of 11.5
cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
