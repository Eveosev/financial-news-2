European debt sharing isn’t possible
without countries accepting external budget oversight,  Peer Steinbrueck , Germany’s former Finance Minister, told  Passauer
Neue Presse .  “First I want to see that Germany and the Mediterranean
countries say, ‘Great, the rule will be: if we can’t keep our
own budgets in order, our budget rights will move to a European
institution,’” the newspaper cited Steinbrueck as saying in an
e-mailed preview of an interview to be published today.
“Otherwise it’s not acceptable for Germany to accept liability
for others. That would be like giving out a  credit card : others
do the shopping, and Germany pays.”  Steinbrueck ruled out a banking union with common deposit
insurance as suggested by European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy , the newspaper said. Strengthening national deposit
insurance together with broader European oversight and a
European bank liquidation law would be possible, the newspaper
cited the Social Democrat lawmaker as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
