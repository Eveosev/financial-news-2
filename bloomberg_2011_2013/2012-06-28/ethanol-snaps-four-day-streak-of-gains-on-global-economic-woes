Ethanol snapped a four-day streak of
gains on concern the slumping global economy will curtail demand
for the biofuel.  Futures fell after a Labor Department report showed
applications for jobless benefits last week at 386,000 hovered
near the highest level of the year and as European leaders
started a two-day summit in Brussels to address the region’s
debt crisis.  “Everything was just coming off today, the energies, crude
oil was down more than $2,” said  John Janney , a vice president
at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in  Chicago .  Denatured ethanol for July delivery slipped 0.7 cent, or
0.3 percent, to $2.209 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the first decline since June 21. Prices have gained 0.3 percent
this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast slid 1.5
cent, or 0.6 percent, to $2.335 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive increased 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.295,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago added 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.21 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel climbed 1 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $2.28.  Crude for August delivery declined $2.52 to $77.69 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since
October. Futures have fallen 25 percent this quarter, heading
for the biggest drop since the final three months of 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
