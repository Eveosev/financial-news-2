A unit of  United Co. Rusal (486) , the
world’s biggest aluminum producer, has lost a dispute with
Russia’s government over electricity payments,  Vedomosti 
reported today, citing documents from the country’s high court.  New rules approved for the wholesale electricity market
last year forced Rusal to pay the difference between market
prices and the price at which it buys power from generators
owned by its chief executive officer and major shareholder,  Oleg Deripaska , Vedomosti said.  Rusal lost its case after filing a claim disputing the
rules last year, the newspaper said.  A Rusal press official, who declined to be identified due
to the company policy, declined to immediately comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
