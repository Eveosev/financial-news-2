Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. (BNWEXCH) ,
Asia’s biggest exchange company by value,  agreed a joint
venture to develop index-linked and equity derivative products
with its mainland Chinese counterparts.  The venture with the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges
will develop cross-border indexes and products based upon them,
according to a statement from  Hong Kong  Exchanges today. The
partners will each invest HK$100 million ($12.89 million) in the
new company, to be established within three months of today’s
signing of the agreement. The announcement comes before  China ’s
President  Hu Jintao  visits Hong Kong for this weekend’s 15th
anniversary of the city’s return to Chinese rule.  Hong Kong Exchanges is trying to expand its business by
offering yuan-denominated and China-linked products as the
pipeline of big initial public offerings from the world’s
second-largest economy slows. The exchange said this month it
has agreed to pay 1.39 billion pounds ($2.16 billion) for the
London Metal Exchange, which handles more than 80 percent of
global trade in futures for industrial metals, of which China is
the No. 1 consumer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
