Sweden’s Financial Supervisory
Authority said it will demand higher requirements for banks’
liquidity buffers to ensure that  credit institutions  hold
sufficient liquidity to manage periods without access to market
funding.  The requirement, which will come into force at the start of
next year, means that a bank’s liquid assets must manage
outflows over a period of 30 days of “market stress,” the
watchdog said in a  statement  on its website. The rules are based
on guidelines from the international Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision which are planned to be introduced within the
European Union in 2015.  The FSA wants the levels of the liquidity buffers to be
made public. Eight banks and credit institutions in Sweden  with
a balance-sheet total of above 100 billion kronor ($14.1
billion) would be covered by the rules, it said.  Parts of Sweden’s bank industry have criticized
the government, arguing more rigorous standards than elsewhere
will distort competition while the government, including
Financial Markets Minister Peter Norman has said stricter rules
are necessary to combat the risk of future financial crises.  Sweden in November told its four biggest banks to target
stricter capital rules than those set by the Basel Committee and
to meet the deadline six years earlier than the group’s 2019
target.  Nordea Bank AB (NDA) ,  Svenska Handelsbanken AB (SHBA) ,  SEB AB (SEBA)  and
 Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , need to target 10 percent core Tier 1 buffers of
their risk-weighted assets from January and 12 percent from
2015. That compares with the Basel Committee’s core capital
target of at least 7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
