The U.S. space agency canceled a
climate study based in  Thailand  after the government failed to
give approval this week, according to a statement from the U.S.
Embassy in Bangkok.  Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra’s Cabinet decided
to have lawmakers debate the request in August, when the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration had planned to
conduct the research on regional weather patterns. Government
opponents said the project may affect national security.  “ NASA  will not be able to carry out the SEAC4RS scientific
study in 2012 because of the lead time necessary to prepare for
the study of specific weather patterns only active in August and
September,” Kristin Kneedler, an embassy spokeswoman, said in
an emailed statement. “It is too early to say at this time
whether resources will be available to revisit the project next
year.”  The Southeast Asia Composition, Cloud, Climate Coupling
Regional Study would have gathered information from more than 12  countries in the region, according to NASA. The agency had asked
Thailand if it could use U-Tapao airport, which hosted U.S.
bombers during the  Vietnam War , as a base for research flights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
