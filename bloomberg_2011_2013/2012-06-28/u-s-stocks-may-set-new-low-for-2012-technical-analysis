The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index was
accompanied by other benchmark gauges when it slid to near its
2012 low on June 4, a sign the market may retreat further,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Equity gauges from Germany to  South Korea  and Brazil also
tumbled to or near their lowest levels of the year that day, as
did other U.S. measures such as the Dow Jones Transportation
Average and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average . Major bottoms in
benchmark equity indexes usually do not occur simultaneously,
 Michael Krauss , head of global technical research at JPMorgan
Chase, wrote in a note to clients dated yesterday.  “More likely it was just the first step down, in a larger
three-step decline from the April high,” Krauss wrote. “Expect
huge divergences at major turns, like this year’s tops” which
were “widely dispersed” between February and May, he said.  The S&P 500 slid as much as 11 percent from its four-year
high on April 2 through June 4, when it sank as low as 1,266.74
intraday amid concern about Europe’s debt crisis and the weakest
growth in American jobs in a year. The gauge then rebounded 5.1
percent through yesterday’s closing level.  Krauss said the index will probably continue its slump
until it reaches 1,250 and may sink as low as 1,180 as the
market mimics last year’s retreat, when the  S&P 500  slid 19
percent from July 7 to Aug. 9. The levels he cited would mark a
tumble of 6.1 percent or 11 percent, respectively, from
yesterday’s close at 1,331.85.  Evidence of a bearish market is also supported by the 14-
month low in the JPM EASI Index, Krauss wrote. That index
measures the degree to which U.S. economic data is beating or
trailing forecasts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
