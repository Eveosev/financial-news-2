Canadian natural gas rose on
forecasts for hot weather that would boost demand from  power
plants  in  Canada  and the Northern U.S.  August gas in Alberta advanced 2.3 percent as most of Canada
and the U.S. were expected to have temperatures 3 degrees
Fahrenheit (2 Celsius) to 14 degrees hotter than normal through
July 7, according to MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg,
Maryland.  “It seems that it’s a little bit of a demand issue for
weather,” Gordy Elliott, a risk management specialist at Intl
FC Stone LLC in St. Louis Park,  Minnesota , said in a telephone
interview.  Alberta gas for August delivery increased 5 cents to
C$2.2125 per gigajoule ($2.03 per million British thermal units)
as of 5 p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian Internet market.
Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada and the
U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 7.6 cents to settle at $2.722 per million Btu.  Weather Derivatives of Belton, Missouri, predicted cooling
demand will be 68 percent above normal in the Midwest, Canada’s
largest export market, through July 5.  “The focus of the hottest conditions remains over the
Midwest, where ongoing upper ridging and drought at the surface
will help to keep temps well above normal,” Travis Hartman, a
meteorologist with MDA EarthSat, wrote today in a forecast for
July 8 to July 12.  Louisville Record  The high in Louisville,  Kentucky , tomorrow may be 105
degrees Fahrenheit, 17 above normal, according to AccuWeather
Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania. It would break a record of
102 degrees set in 1936, the service said on its website.  Alberta gas fell earlier after the Energy Department said
 U.S. stockpiles  grew by 57 billion cubic feet to 3.063 trillion
in the week ended June 22.  Analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg forecast an increase of 53 billion.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago fell
7.93 cents to $2.8867 per million Btu on the  Intercontinental
Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas declined 2.65 cents to $2.5039 per million Btu. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, prices dropped 3.08 cents to $2.6421.  Alberta Flows  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.7 billion cubic
feet at 5 p.m.  New York  time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.96 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.03 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at  Kingsgate  was 538 million cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 2.08 billion cubic feet today, or 79 percent
of normal capacity of 2.62 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.87
billion cubic feet at 4:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
