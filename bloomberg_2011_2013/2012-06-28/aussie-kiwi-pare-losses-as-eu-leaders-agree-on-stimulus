The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars pared losses against their U.S. peer after the European
Union agreed to spend 120 billion euros ($149 billion) to
stimulate growth and create jobs.  The currencies still closed lower against most of their
major peers as speculation EU leaders meeting in Brussels will
fail to agree on a strategy to solve the sovereign-debt crisis
cut demand for commodity-linked assets.  “Given the correlation of the markets you see right now, I
think it’s part of a general risk-off move,” David Grad, a
foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of America Corp. in New
York, said in a telephone interview. “Given the high-beta
status of the Aussie and Kiwi in this risk environment, that’s
primarily what’s been behind the move.” High-beta currencies
tend to have the greatest volatility.  The Aussie fell 0.4 percent to $1.0045 in  New York 
yesterday, after earlier dropping as much as 0.8 percent. The
currency traded 0.7 percent stronger at 79.81 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, known as the kiwi, declined 0.4
percent to 78.83 U.S. cents. It rose 0.8 percent to 62.62 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
decreased 1.7 percent as commodities fell the most in a week on
European skepticism and a report that showed U.S. jobless claims
hovered near the highest level of the year.  Most foreign-exchange funds rose in May amid European
crisis turmoil, which spurred investors to seek safety in the
dollar and yen while shunning higher-yielding currencies,
according to a Parker Global Strategies LCC Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
