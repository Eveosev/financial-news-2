The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default dropped, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan   index  fell 2.5 basis points to 182
as of 9:40 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
benchmark is headed for its lowest close since June 20, and has
fallen from a seven-month high of 217 basis points May 18,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia  index  of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan declined 2 basis points to 181.5 as of
8:11 a.m. in  Singapore , according to Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices. The index is set for its lowest close since
June 22, after trading in a 153.5 to 210 basis-point range since
the end of March, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia  index  decreased 2 basis points
to 190 as of 10:09 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices
show. The gauge has risen 42 basis points since April through
yesterday, according to CMA.  All three indexes are headed for their first three-month
increase since the quarter ended September, the data show.
Contracts on Japanese companies increased 31 and the Asia index
climbed 24 in the period, according to CMA data.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
