Russia , which links its excise tax
on motor fuels to their environmental impact, will change the
rates for gasoline and diesel on July 1, according to the
country’s  tax code .  The tax on low-sulfur Euro-5 gasoline will drop to 5,143
rubles ($156) a metric ton from 6,822 rubles a ton. The excise
tax on Euro-4 gasoline will be unchanged, while rates for more
sulfurous grades will increase.  Euro-5 gasoline and diesel have a maximum sulfur content of
10 parts per million and Euro-4 has a limit of 50 ppm. Euro-3
gasoline can have as much as 150 ppm sulfur, while Euro-3 diesel
has a ceiling of 350 ppm.  The following table shows scheduled excise tax changes from
now until the end of 2014. Figures are in rubles per ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
