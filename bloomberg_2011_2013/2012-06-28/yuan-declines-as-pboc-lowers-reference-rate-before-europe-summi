China ’s  yuan  fell for the first time
in four days as the central bank lowered the currency’s
reference rate before European leaders meet today to discuss the
region’s debt crisis.  The People’s Bank of China set its daily  fixing  0.03
percent weaker at 6.3190 per dollar, still 0.6 percent stronger
than yesterday’s close in Shanghai. The currency can trade as
much as 1 percent on either side of the official rate.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel , speaking on the eve of Europe’s 19th
summit on the debt crisis, said Germany’s constitution wouldn’t
allow joint euro bonds.  “Investors aren’t optimistic that European leaders will
come up with any remedies,” said  Daniel Chan , executive vice-
president at Glory Sky Global Markets Ltd. in Hong Kong. “China
won’t let the yuan strengthen as it wants to support exports
given how bad the external environment is.”  The yuan fell 0.03 percent to close at 6.3575 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
It dropped as much as 0.21 percent to 6.3685 earlier, the most
since April 5. The currency has declined 0.94 percent this
quarter, its worst performance since a dollar peg ended in July
2005.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 1.8 percent
today, down from 2.2 percent at the end of last month.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.02
percent to 6.3623 per dollar. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards declined 0.07 percent to 6.4174, a 0.9 percent discount
to the onshore spot rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
