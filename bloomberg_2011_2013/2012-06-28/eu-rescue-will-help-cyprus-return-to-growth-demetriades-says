European Central Bank council member
Panicos Demetriades said Cyprus’s decision to seek a European
rescue will help it return to economic growth.  “The rescue mechanism will help Cyprus in a substantial way
to overcome today’s problems and return as early as possible to
the path of sustainable growth,” Demetriades, who is also
governor of the  Central Bank of Cyprus , said in a speech in
Limassol today, according to an e-mailed copy of the text.  Cyprus’s economy, the euro area’s third smallest, may
shrink as much as 1.1 percent this year and grow 0.4 percent in
2013, the Central Bank of Cyprus said on June 7.  “We should mainly aim at increasing productivity through
structural reforms and containing the rate of wage increases,
not necessarily at substantial pay cuts damaging overall
demand,” Demetriades said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
