The U.K., which shut its embassy in
Tehran last year after it was raided by militants, has reached
an agreement with  Iran  to open interests sections, Iranian state
media reported.  Oman will be in charge of the Iranian interests section in
London, while Sweden will represent British interests in Tehran,
Iran’s Foreign Minister  Ali Akbar Salehi  said yesterday,
according to the official  Islamic Republic News Agency .  The decision came following Salehi’s talks with U.K.
Foreign Secretary  William Hague  during a summit in  Afghanistan 
earlier this month, the state-run  Press TV  news channel said in
a report on its website early today.  The Foreign Office in London wasn’t immediately able to
comment on the reports.  The U.K. closed its embassy in Tehran and ordered Iran to
remove its diplomats from London after the sites were stormed in
November by the pro-government Basij militia, which accused
Britain of links to the assassination of Iranian nuclear
scientists.  Iran’s “Foreign Ministry will take measures for Iranians
residing in the U.K. to follow on their consular affairs with
more ease,” Salehi told reporters in Tehran, according to IRNA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
