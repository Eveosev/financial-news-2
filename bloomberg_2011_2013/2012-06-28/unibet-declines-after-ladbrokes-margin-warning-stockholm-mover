Unibet Group Plc (UNIB) , the Swedish-
listed, Malta-based online gaming company, fell the most in six
weeks after  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  said a decline in online profit will
be worse than expected, partly due to poor gambling margins.  Ladbrokes, the U.K. operator of about 2,100 betting shops,
fell the most in three years  plunging  as much as 10 percent, the
biggest intraday drop since May 2009 and the worst performance
on the FTSE All-Share Index. Unibet fell as much as 3.6 percent
to 174 kronor in Stockholm trading and was down 2.2 percent to
176.5 kronor as of 1:30 p.m. in the Swedish capital, giving the
company a market value of 5 billion kronor ($708 million.)  Investors drove down other gambling shares, with  Bwin.Party
Digital Entertainment Plc (BPTY)  falling as much as 7 percent after UBS
cut earnings estimates.  William Hill Plc (WMH)  declined as much as 2.9
percent, while Stockholm-based  Betsson AB (BETSB)  was down as much as
2.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
