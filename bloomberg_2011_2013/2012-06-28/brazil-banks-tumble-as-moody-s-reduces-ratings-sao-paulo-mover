Banco Itau Unibanco SA (ITUB)  and  Banco
Bradesco SA (BBDC4)  declined after their credit ratings were cut by
Moody’s Investors Service.  The banks fell after the ratings company cut standalone
financial strength ratings or baseline credit assessments for
them and six other Brazilian lenders, citing their exposure to
government debt. The cuts, part of a global review of banks
rated higher than their home countries, also reflect a
dependence on the local economy and the influence of  market
sentiment  on their funding base, Moody’s said in a statement.  “There are little, if any, reasons to believe that these
banks would be insulated from a government debt crisis,”
Moody’s said in the statement. “We note their significant
direct exposure to the Brazilian  government securities ,
equivalent to 167 percent of tier 1 capital on average.”  Itau fell 0.9 percent to 27.25 reais at 11:28 a.m. in Sao
Paulo, while Bradesco slid 1.1 percent to 29.29 reais.  Banco do
Brasil SA , the country’s largest lender, was little changed at
18.78 reais after earlier dropping as much as 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
