The euro stayed lower against the
dollar and the yen after Italian borrowing costs rose at an
auction.  The 17-nation shared currency weakened 0.3 percent to
$1.2434 as of 10:17 a.m. London time. It declined 0.7 percent to
98.66 yen.  Italy sold 5.4 billion euros of debt due in 2017 and 2022.
The average yield on the ten-year bond was 6.19 percent,
compared to 6.03 percent at an auction on May 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
