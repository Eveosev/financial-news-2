Home Inns & Hotels Management Inc. (HMIN) ,
 China ’s biggest budget hotel operator, is maintaining its sales
growth forecast as leisure travel resists the slowdown in Asia’s
largest economy, said Chief Executive Officer David Sun.  The Shanghai-based company, which runs almost 1,500 hotels
in more than 220 Chinese cities, is sticking with a forecast of
20 percent revenue increase in 2012 as it plans to add 330 to
360 hotels annually in the coming three years, Sun said
yesterday. While room occupancy rate at Home Inns has fallen
since November by as much as 3 percentage points, the level is
still at 90 percent, the CEO said.  “China’s leisure travels have been rising noticeably since
October 2010, taking an increasingly larger part of our customer
base,” Sun said in an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in
 New York , “I’m confident about the market growth potential.
Especially the next three to five years.”  American depositary receipts of Home Inns posted the
longest winning streak in three weeks yesterday, jumping 2.7
percent to $21.42 in New York. The  Bloomberg China-US Equity
Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese companies in New York tumbled
1.5 percent to 88.61, led by a 6.5 percent slump in  Elong Inc. (LONG) ,
China’s second-biggest online travel agency. The gauge has
retreated 1.5 percent  this year .  At least four economists cut their  growth  estimates for the
world’s second-largest economy in the last two weeks, with Daiwa
Securities Group Inc. reducing its second-quarter forecast to
7.8 percent from 8.2 percent on June 27. Gross domestic product
grew 8.1 percent in the three months to March 30, the least
since the second quarter of 2009, as the slowing global economy
dragged on the nation’s exports.  ‘Sluggish Demand’  “We’ve felt sluggish demand from small and medium business
travelers starting in November, especially in export-oriented
regions,” Sun said. “We still need to build up our capacity
and can’t just stop expanding amid a relative slowdown.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., dropped 0.4 percent to $32.49,
snapping a two-day rally. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of
mainland stocks fell 1 percent to 2,195.84, erasing this year’s
gain after losing 7.4 percent this month. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index of U.S. shares retreated 0.2 percent to 1,329.04.  Home Inns has lost 17 percent this year. That compares with
an 8.4 percent slump in  7 Days Group Holdings Ltd. (SVN) , the second-
largest economy hotel chain operator in China, and a 20 percent
rout in  China lodging Group Ltd. , a budget hotel operator based
in  Shanghai .  Higher-End Hotels  Leisure travelers will rise from the current 20 percent
share of Home Inns’ customers while small business travelers
account for about 65 percent, Sun said, adding that the company
also plans to open four more higher-end hotels this year and at
least six more in 2013. The existing four such outlets, called
Yitel, are targeting at middle-class travelers and have an
occupancy rate of about 85 percent, he said.  “It takes normally two years to complete a project, and we
foresee  China’s economy  will show more positive growth by the
second half of 2013 at the latest. The new government will
surely take actions to boost growth” after taking office early
next year, Sun said.  The company incurred a  net loss  of 103.2 million  yuan 
($16.4 million) for the first quarter, which included a loss of
53.2 million yuan from its acquisition of Motel 168
International Holdings Ltd. in September 2011, it said in a May
10 statement. The company will likely be back into profit in the
 second quarter , Sun said, adding net income and profit margin
this year will be lower than 2011 mainly due to the acquisition.  HiSoft Technology  HiSoft Technology International Ltd. (HSFT) , a Chinese  software
developer  which counts General Electric Co. and Microsoft Corp.
as customers, dipped 2 percent to $13.50 in New York trading.
The Dalian-based company received about half of its sales from
the U.S. last year, and about 20 percent from China, Chief
Financial Officer Christine Lu-Wong said in a phone interview
from Dalian in northeastern China on June 27. Its dependence on
the  U.S. economy  is helping it outperform Chinese peers that
rely more on the domestic market, Lu-Wong said.  VanceInfo Technologies Inc. (VIT) , a Beijing-based software
developer, sank 5 percent to $9.21 after jumping 9.2 percent the
previous day.  ISoftStone Holdings Ltd. (ISS)  slumped for a fifth day,
losing 2.6 percent to a $5.55, the lowest level since June 4.  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , China’s biggest online search engine, slid 2.5
percent to $108.62, the lowest level since Oct. 3. Beijing-based
 Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd. (QIHU) , which develops computer security
software as well as desktop applications, may start a full
search service as early as this year, which is a “clear
negative” for Baidu, Citigroup analyst Bin Liu said in a
research note yesterday. Qihoo fell 1.9 percent to a three-day
low of $17.20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
