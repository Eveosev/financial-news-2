Nigeria , Africa’s largest oil
producer, plans to export four cargoes of Erha crude in August,
unchanged from July, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Each shipment is for 997,500 to 1 million barrels, the plan
showed.  Shipping agendas for Akpo haven’t been released. Loading
programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments compiled by
field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their supply
and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
