There were no deliveries of coffee
from farms to ports in  Ivory Coast ,  Africa ’s third-biggest
producer of the beans, in the week to Aug. 21, according to a
document from the industry regulator.  Arrivals since the start of the marketing season on Jan. 1
total 20,372 metric tons, the document from the Abidjan-based
Bourse du Cafe et du Cacao showed.  Ivory Coast mainly grows robusta beans, a variety used in
instant coffee and espresso. Ethiopia and Uganda are the
continent’s top coffee growers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
