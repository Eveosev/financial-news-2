Edgar Cullman Sr., who cultivated
Americans’ taste for cigars through General Cigar Co., maker of
brands including Macanudo and White Owl, has died. He was 93.  He died Aug. 28 at his home in  Stamford , Connecticut,
according to the New York Times, citing his son, Edgar Jr.  Cullman led the fourth generation of his family’s
involvement in cigars, which, according to a company  history ,
began in 1848 with Ferdinand Kullman, a wine merchant who
immigrated to the U.S. from  Germany . Cullman joined his father’s
tobacco business in 1944 and, in 1961, led a group of investors
in buying a controlling interest in New York-based General
Cigar, the producer of cigar brands including White Owl, William
Penn and Van Dyck.  Cullman served as chief executive officer from 1962 to
2005, and as president from 1962 to 1981. As cigars exploded in
popularly in the 1990s, General Cigar opened Club Macanudo, a
cigar bar in  New York .  “We feel very much it’s part of a cultural shift,
something that is happening throughout our society, a real
interest in the finer things in life, a return of the
gentleman,” his son told Bloomberg Radio in 1997.  The family sold General Cigar in 2005 to  Swedish Match AB (SWMA) ,
maker of Red Man chewing tobacco.  Edgar Meyer Cullman was born on Jan. 7, 1918. His father,
Joseph Jr., bought land in the Connecticut River Valley, where
tobacco for cigar wrappers is grown, as well as the controlling
interest in cigarette maker Benson & Hedges before selling the
business to Philip Morris & Co. in the 1950s, the Times said.  Edgar’s brother, Joseph III, who died in 2004, was chairman
and chief executive of  Philip Morris .  Edgar Cullman earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from
 Yale University  in 1940.  Survivors include his wife of 73 years, the former Louise
Bloomingdale, of the department store family, according to the
Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
