Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened after
pipeline outages that occurred during Hurricane Irene held up
supply shipments from the U.S. refining center.  Colonial Pipeline Co. allocated fuel shipments on Line 01
for Cycle 50, according to a notice to shippers yesterday. Line
01 carries gasoline north of Collins, Mississippi. The company
shut product flow on some of its lines in  North Carolina  and
Virginia because of power outages and other problems associated
with the hurricane that struck North Carolina Aug. 27 and moved
up the East Coast.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast fell 2.13 cents to 3.5 cents a gallon at 4:14 p.m. in
New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery gained 5.07 cents to $2.8765 a gallon.  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP)  yesterday also returned
its Plantation oil products pipeline from Greensboro, North
Carolina, to Washington, D.C., to service after shutting the
line a day earlier, Emily Mir, a company spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
