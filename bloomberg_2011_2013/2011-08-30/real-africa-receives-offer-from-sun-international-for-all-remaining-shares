Real Africa Holdings Ltd. (RAH) , a South
African company with interests in gaming and tourism, rose the
most in four months after Sun International Ltd. offered to buy
shares in the company it doesn’t already own.  The stock added as much as 4 percent, the biggest intraday
advance since April 28 and its first gain in 10 days, to 3.90
rand. It was trading at 3.80 rand as of 2:51 p.m. in
Johannesburg, giving Real Africa a market value of 1.4 billion
rand ($200 million). Sun International climbed 1.4 percent to
87.24 rand for a market value of 9.7 billion rand.  Sun International, the second-largest hotel and casino
operator in  South Africa , offered to buy 30.6 percent of Real
Africa for 4.08 rand, Real Africa said in a statement today. Sun
International wants to buy Real Africa to simplify the structure
of its investments in South Africa, Chief Executive Officer
David Coutts-Trotter said in an interview yesterday.  Sun International, which according to Bloomberg data owns
63 percent in Real Africa, is seeking to buy the 30.6 percent
stake it doesn’t already own from  Grand Parade Investments Ltd. (GPL)   The transaction follows a deal between Grand Parade and Sun
International in which Grand Parade cut its holdings in SunWest
International Ltd., which operates the GrandWest and Table Bay
Hotel, and the Golden Valley Casino and Lodge in the Western
Cape.  To contact the reporter on this story:
