Seat Pagine Gialle SpA (PG)  has received
a proposal from holders of its so-called Lighthouse bond, Chief
Financial Officer Massimo Cristofori said on a conference call
with reporters today.  The preliminary, non-binding proposal covers a “pretty
consistent” portion of the bond, and “headroom” for the
company’s bond convenants will likely be tighter by the end of
the year. The company doesn’t expect to breach the convenants,
Cristofori said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
