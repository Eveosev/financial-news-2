French Open champion Li Na of  China 
lost in the first round of the  U.S. Open , leaving the tournament
with no current women’s Grand Slam champions.  Li, seeded sixth, lost 6-2, 7-5 to Simona Halep of  Romania ,
joining Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova of the  Czech Republic 
as a first-round loser.  The Australian Open and reigning U.S. Open champion,  Kim
Clijsters  of  Belgium , is missing this year’s U.S. Open because
of a strained stomach muscle.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
