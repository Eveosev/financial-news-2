Abengoa SA (ABG) , the Spanish engineering
firm that develops solar-thermal generators and manufactures
biofuels, said net income rose 11 percent in the first half as
it commissioned new power and ethanol plants.  Profit reached 102.1 million euros ($148 million) compared
with analysts’ estimates of 108.8 million euros, the company
said in a regulatory filing today. Sales rose 38 percent to 3.1
billion euros while operating margin narrowed to 14.8 percent
from 14.9 percent.  Abengoa agreed to sell Brazilian power transmission lines
and its 40 percent stake in information technology company
Telvent SA during the half for 929 million euros to recycle its
capital for new projects. The deals are set to close in the
third quarter and will reduce Abengoa’s net debt by 1.4 billion
euros.  The company, based in Seville,  Spain , said it plans to
boost investment in  Latin America  to diversify its business as
insulation against the three-year decline roiling its home
market. International sales were 78 percent of the total in the
period with 54 percent coming from the U.S. and Latin America.  Solar power revenue tripled to 50 million euros as it
opened three new plants and biofuel sales increased by 72
percent to 987 million euros after the company started new
ethanol factories in  Indiana ,  Illinois  and the Netherlands and
commodity prices rose. The order book for engineering work was
7.8 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
