Solar Millennium AG (S2M) , a German
developer of solar-thermal  power plants , is looking to sell as
much as 25 percent to a strategic investor to finance growth.  The company is targeting a sale of 10 percent to 25 percent
to “one or two anchor shareholders,” Chief Executive Officer
Christoph Wolff said in a phone interview today. Potential
buyers include technology companies and talks will be “pushed
over the next six to 12 months,” he said.  Solar Millennium is also in talks with banks to secure
bridge financing within two to six weeks, Wolff said. The move
is aimed at plugging a gap left by a delay to 2012 in the
financial close of the company’s biggest project, the 1-gigawatt
plant near Blythe,  California , he said.  Solar Millennium, which has focused on developing solar-
thermal plants, on Aug. 18 forecast full-year losses and said
photovoltaic technology would be used for at least half of
Blythe because it would make the project more profitable. The
shares have plunged 67 percent since the previous day’s close.  The strategy change at Blythe doesn’t mean the Erlangen-
based company is giving up its core technology, Wolff said.  We are a solar-thermal “company and we will stick to that,
but we need to broaden our portfolio as we become bigger and
more exposed and more diverse,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
