Polyus Gold International Ltd.
offered 1,900.27 rubles a share to buy out minority investors in
OAO Polyus Gold as part of an earlier reverse takeover.  The company commented in a statement today.  Polyus Gold International, formerly KazakhGold Group Ltd.,
completed the purchase of about 89 percent of OAO Polyus Gold in
July to inject Russian assets into the U.K.-listed company and
boost the groupâ€™s access to investors abroad. About half of the
minority investors, holding about a 10th of the shares, joined
the so-called reverse takeover, KazakhGold said on July 19.  In the second stage of its share exchange offer,  Jersey ,
Channel Islands-based Polyus Gold International raised its
holding in OAO Polyus Gold to 91.5 percent this month.  Polyus will need $1.1 billion to fund the deal should all
minorities accept the offer, and likely use a 50 billion ruble
($1.7 billion) bank guarantee provided by VTB, Dmitry Smolyn, an
analyst at Uralsib Capital, said today by phone.  It may sell treasury shares held by unit Jenington
International Inc to pay back the debt, he said. Polyus Gold
spokesman Anton Arens declined to comment on the financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
