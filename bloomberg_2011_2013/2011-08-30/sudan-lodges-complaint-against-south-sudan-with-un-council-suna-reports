Sudan  lodged an official complaint
against South Sudan at the  United Nations Security Council ,
accusing it of fomenting instability in Southern Kordofan state
and  Darfur , the state-run  news agency  said.  South Sudan is supporting rebels in the western region of
Darfur, where insurgents have battled government forces for the
past eight years, and has troops in Southern Kordofan, SUNA news
agency said today, citing the complaint. It has also sent
soldiers to the disputed region of Abyei, SUNA said. An official
of South Sudan’s ruling party denied the charges.  The complaint came hours after  Amnesty International  and
 Human Rights Watch  said Sudan’s armed forces continued to bomb
civilian areas in Southern Kordofan state following President
Umar al-Bashir declaration of a cease-fire last week. Government
forces have clashed since June 5 in the state with fighters from
the northern branch of the ruling party in neighboring South
Sudan, which gained independence on July 9.  Martin Majut, an official with South Sudan’s ruling Sudan
People’s Liberation Movement, said in a telephone interview from
the nation’s capital, Juba, that the Sudanese charges were
“baseless.”  Southern Kordofan is Sudan’s only oil-producing state,
accounting for 115,000 barrels a day, according to the energy
ministry. South Sudan assumed control of 75 percent of the
country’s former daily crude output of 490,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
