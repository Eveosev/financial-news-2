The rate at which London-based banks
say they can borrow for three months in dollars rose to the
highest in more than a year after climbing for a 28th
consecutive day.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for dollar
loans increased to 0.33056 percent from 0.32944 percent
yesterday, according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s
the highest since Aug. 19, 2010, and the longest stretch of
gains since November 2005.  The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, was at 24.06 basis points as of 12:02 p.m. in London.
It reached 24.38 basis points on Aug. 26, the most since Aug. 6,
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
