ARM Asset Backed Securities SA, a
Luxembourg-based special-purpose vehicle, won’t be allowed to
redeem its bonds or pay coupons after the country’s financial
watchdog refused to grant it a license.  ARM has four weeks to appeal the decision, the Commission
de Surveillance du Secteur Financier said in an e-mailed
statement today.  A district court “will be requested to pronounce the
dissolution and order the liquidation of ARM” if the decision
is unchallenged, the CSSF said.  ARM bonds were listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and its
financial products were marketed in the U.K.,  Europe  and the
U.S., the U.K.  Financial Services Authority  said in a statement
on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
