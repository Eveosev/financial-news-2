A former employee of  Akamai
Technologies Inc. (AKAM)  admitted providing trade secrets to an
undercover U.S. agent posing as an Israeli intelligence officer.  Elliot Doxer, 43, pleaded guilty to one count of foreign
economic espionage, according to a statement today from the
office of U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz in Boston.  Doxer sent an e-mail to the Israeli consulate in Boston in
2006 saying he worked in Akamai’s finance department and had
information that might be helpful to Israel, the U.S. attorney’s
office said in the statement. He said he wanted to be paid, the
U.S. attorney said.  In 2007 a federal agent posing as an Israeli intelligence
officer contacted Doxer and established a place where he could
leave information. He provided the agent with data about
Akamai’s customers and contracts.  Akamai, based in Cambridge,  Massachusetts , provides
technology for delivering content over the Internet.  Doxer faces a sentence of 15 years in prison. U.S. District
Judge Denise Casper set sentencing for November 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
