Liverpool signed defender Sebastian
Coates, who was voted the best young player at July’s  Copa
America , for an undisclosed fee from Uruguayan club Nacional.  Coates, 20, signed a “long-term contract” after passing a
medical exam and securing a work permit, the 18-time English
soccer champion said last night on its website.  The 6-foot-6 central defender made his senior international
debut at the Copa America and helped  Uruguay  win its record 15th
South American championship. He’ll link up at Anfield with
national teammateLuis Suarez, who joined Liverpool in January.  “To come to such a big club alongside a fellow countryman
is very important for me,” Coates said in an interview with the
club’s website. “I know Luis will help me settle in, we have
the same cultures and customs so having him around will help me
a lot.”  Liverpool said it also reached an agreement with French
club Evian Thonon Gaillard for the transfer of Danish midfielder
Christian Poulsen, who will now discuss personal terms.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
