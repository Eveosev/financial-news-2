Serbia’s economy may expand only 2.5
percent this year, not 3 percent as its central bank and the
 International Monetary Fund  have forecast, Vecernje Novosti
newspaper said on its  website , citing a government source it did
not name.  The possible lower growth rate emerged after an analysis of
recent budget revenue, employment and other data conducted amid
talks with an IMF mission about a new, precautionary loan
arrangement with Serbia, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
