Mauritius lowered its forecast for
this year’s trade deficit to 79 billion rupees ($2.8 billion),
the  Central Statistics Office  said, as the currency’s strength
curbs import bills and exports of textiles increase.  The shortfall was revised from an initial forecast of 83
billion rupees, the Port Louis-based office said in a  statement 
today on its website. The  trade gap  rose 6.1 percent to 33.3
billion rupees in the first half from a year earlier, it said.  Exports climbed 15 percent to 36.2 billion rupees in the
first half while imports rose 11 percent to 69.5 billion rupees.
About 67 percent of imports bills are dollar-denominated and 41
percent of exports are euro-denominated.  “The improved forecast can be attributed to a stronger
rupee for the first semester,” Swadicq Nuthay, an economist at
Axys Capital Management Ltd., said by telephone from  Port Louis ,
the capital. “Exports have increased in rupee terms, indicating
that textile and apparel manufacturers still have positive
momentum.”  The rupee strengthened 9.3 percent versus the dollar in the
first half and 1.6 percent against the euro, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It weakened by 0.7 percent to 27.95 per
dollar at 1:50 p.m. in Port Louis.  Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation with a population
of 1.3 million, is a net buyer of fuels and food. Sales of
textiles surged almost 18 percent to 12.5 billion rupees in the
first half, the statistics office said.  Europe , led by the U.K., buys 65 percent of Mauritius’s
manufactured goods, the statistics office said.  India  is the
country’s largest trade partner by imports, accounting for 26
percent of bills, as Mauritius buys all of its fuel requirements
from Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
