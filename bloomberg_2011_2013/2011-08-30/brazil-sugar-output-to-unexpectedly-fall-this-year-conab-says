Sugar output in  Brazil , the world’s
largest producer and exporter of the sweetener, will
unexpectedly fall this year after freezing weather pared crop
yields, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  Sugar production will drop to 37.1 million metric tons this
year from 38.2 million in 2010, the ministry’s crop-forecasting
agency, known as Conab, said today in an e-mailed statement.
That compares with a May 10 forecast that output would increase
to 40.9 million tons.  Plantations in Brazil, which accounts for more than half of
global sugar exports, have been harmed by freezing temperatures
this year following a drought last year.  The South American country will produce 588.9 million tons
of sugar cane this year, 8.3 percent less than a previous
estimate of 642 million tons, Conab said. The forecast for
ethanol output was cut to 23.7 billion liters, from 27.1 billion
liters projected in May. Brazil produced 623.9 million tons of
cane and 27.6 billion liters of ethanol last year.  Brazilian cane growers are renovating 911,162 hectares of
aging cane fields, Conab said. That compares with a previous
estimate of 810,860 hectares. Growers don’t have enough cash to
renovate all of the 1.4 million hectares that require
replanting, Conab said.  Raw sugar for October delivery fell 0.9 percent to 29.62
cents a pound at 10:38 a.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
