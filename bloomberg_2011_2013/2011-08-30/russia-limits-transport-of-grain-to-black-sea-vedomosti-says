OAO Russian Railways limited
transportation of grain to the Black Sea  port of Novorossiysk
for export, citing a shortage of rolling stock, Vedomosti
 reported  today.  The limitation began on Aug. 27, the newspaper said, citing
a company statement. More that 3,600 grain trucks are stuck in a
traffic jam on the North Caucasus region of the rail network,
the newspaper said.  Russia  lifted an embargo on grain exports from July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
