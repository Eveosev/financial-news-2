Coffee rose in  London  on speculation
European stockpiles will fall with supplies limited in  Vietnam ,
the world’s largest producer of robusta beans. Sugar fell.  Robusta coffee inventories with valid grading certificates
were 398,090 metric tons as of Aug. 22, down 1.6 percent
from two weeks earlier, a third consecutive fall, NYSE Liffe
figures on Aug. 25 showed. Arabica coffee prices in New York
jumped 1.9 percent yesterday while the London market was closed.  “The tight supply in the robusta market due to lack of
farmer selling is likely supporting the price,” Keith Flury, an
analyst at Rabobank International in London, said in an e-mail
today. “Robusta is also catching up with yesterday’s rise in
the arabica market.”  Robusta coffee for November delivery climbed $9, or 0.4
percent, to $2,371 a ton by 10:18 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.
Arabica coffee for December delivery fell 1.95 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.825 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Arabica beans are grown mostly in  Latin America  and favored by
specialty coffee shops.  High prices in Vietnam encouraged farmers to sell before
now, leaving “very little supply at origin,” Rabobank said in
a report on Aug. 26.  Global coffee production will need to rise by 20 million
bags in the next 10 years, Santos-based broker Escritorio
Carvalhaes said in a report e-mailed yesterday. “World stocks
are dropping every year, while global consumption increases
above two million bags yearly,” it said in the report.  Coffee and Cocoa  Coffee may outperform cocoa as production falls short of
demand, tightening global supply, said  Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) ,
one of the world’s three biggest suppliers of both commodities.  “The difficulties in terms of adequate supply and
declining stocks-consumption ratios will support coffee prices
in the near term,” said Sunny Verghese, chief executive officer
of Olam. He did not elaborate on the size of the expected
shortfall.  White, or refined, sugar for October delivery dropped
$12.80, or 1.6 percent, to $767.80 a ton in London. Raw sugar
for October delivery fell 0.46 cent, or 1.5 percent, to 29.43
cents a pound in  New York .  Brazil ’s agriculture ministry’s crop-forecasting agency,
known as Conab, will release its second estimate for this year’s
sugar-cane crop in at 9 a.m. Brasilia time today.  Cocoa for December rose 11 pounds, or 0.6 percent, to 1,950
pounds ($3,187) a ton on NYSE Liffe. Cocoa for December delivery
fell $18, or 0.6 percent, to $3,117 a ton on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
