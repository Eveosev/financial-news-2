Taiwan’s government bonds gained,
pushing five-year yields to a one-week low, on speculation a
slowing economy and easing inflation will prompt the central
bank to halt interest-rate increases.  Yields on most-traded debt due 2016 fell 20 basis points
this month, the first decline since March, after the government
cut its growth and inflation estimates for the year on Aug. 18.
Consumer prices rose 1.32 percent in July from a year earlier,
the slowest pace in three months, according to government data.
The monetary authority last boosted its benchmark rate on June
30 by 12.5 basis points to 1.875 percent. The policy board is
set to meet again in late September.  “Yields continue to edge lower as inflation concern has
waned,” said  James Wang , a fixed-income trader at Yuanta
Securities Co. in Taipei. “Some short-sellers are buying back
bonds after seeing it’s getting more and more difficult to push
up yields.” A short position is a bet that an asset will fall.  The yield on the 2 percent note due July 2016 declined one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.018 percent as of
the 1:30 p.m. local close, prices from Gretai Securities Market
show. That is the lowest level since Aug. 24. The rate dropped
to 0.974 percent on Aug. 19, the least since December.  The government lowered this month its economic-growth
outlook for 2011 to 4.81 percent from 5.01 percent and reduced
the inflation estimate to 1.59 percent from 1.89 percent.  Taiwan’s dollar was little changed at NT$29.035 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.392 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
