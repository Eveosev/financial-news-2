million, the report showed.  Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, dropped
563,000 barrels to 33.1 million.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  The government report may show stockpiles of crude oil fell
500,000 barrels last week, according to the median of 13
responses in a Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline inventories
probably dropped 950,000 barrels, the survey showed.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for October delivery rose $1.35, or 1.5 percent,
