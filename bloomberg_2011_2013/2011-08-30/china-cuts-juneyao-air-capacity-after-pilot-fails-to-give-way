JuneYao Airlines Co. , the Shanghai-
based carrier, had its capacity cut by 10 percent for three
months and was barred from hiring foreign crew after a pilot
failed to give way to a plane making an emergency landing.  The carrier will also be prevented from setting up
subsidiaries and from buying or leasing new aircraft, the East
China Regional Administration of the Civil Aviation
Administration of China said in a  statement  on its website
yesterday. It didn’t say how long the suspensions will last.  In the incident at  Shanghai ’s Hongqiao Airport on Aug. 13,
the JuneYao aircraft didn’t give way to a Qatar Airways Ltd.
plane even after six orders from air-traffic control, the
regulator said. The Qatar aircraft had been diverted to Hongqiao
from nearby Pudong Airport because of a thunderstorm. Both the
Qatar and JuneYao pilots said they needed priority because of
fuel shortages.  Investigations showed that the JuneYao plane had enough
fuel onboard to fly for another 72 minutes when it landed, the
regulator said. The Qatar plane had 48 minutes’ worth. Both
figures include reserve fuel loads.  The JuneYao captain, who is South Korean, had his license
revoked and was banned from seeking to fly in  China  again. His
copilot was grounded for six months.  Zhou Min, a spokesman for JuneYao Group, didn’t answer a
call to his mobile phone today.  JuneYao Group , which also
invests in real estate, is the parent of JuneYao Air. The
carrier flies to destinations including Hong Kong, Macau,
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Harbin and Xi’an. It has a fleet of 22 Airbus
SAS A320-family planes, with eight more on order, according to
Ascend data on Aviation Week’s  website .  The Qatar pilot underestimated how much fuel their plane
had, which the Qatari aviation authorities have been informed
about, the regulator said. Otherwise, the pilot acted
appropriately, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
