The following is the text of
the industrial product and raw material prices report as
reported by  Statistics Canada .  Between June and July, the Industrial Product Price
Index (IPPI) declined 0.3% and the Raw Materials Price
Index (RMPI) fell 1.2%. The largest contributors to the
IPPI's decline were chemical products and motor vehicles,
while mineral fuels were the major factor in the decrease
of the RMPI.  The decrease of the IPPI in July was the third in three
months and comparable to the declines of 0.2% in May and
June. The July contraction was primarily a result of lower
prices for chemicals and chemical products (-2.6%) and for
motor vehicles and other transportation equipment (-1.3%).
Pulp and paper products (-1.1%) also contributed to the
decline.  The decline in chemical products in July was mainly
attributable to the organic chemicals group (-8.8%), most
of whose products were down. Lower production costs,
market and competition conditions, and the strength of the
Canadian dollar against the US dollar all played a
significant role in the decline of chemical product
prices. The decrease in motor vehicle prices (-1.3%) was
primarily a result of a 2.2% rise in the value of the
Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar.  Some Canadian producers who export their products are
paid on the basis of prices set in US dollars.
Consequently, the strength of the Canadian dollar in
relation to the US dollar had the effect of reducing the
corresponding prices in Canadian dollars. Without the
impact of the exchange rate, the IPPI would have risen
0.2% instead of falling 0.3%.  The decline in the IPPI in July was moderated by upward
movements in primary metal products (+1.2%) and petroleum
and coal products (+0.5%).  Excluding petroleum and coal products, the IPPI would
have fallen 0.5% in July, following a 0.2% gain in June.  12-month change in the IPPI: Increase in July comparable
to the gains observed between March and June  The IPPI was up 5.1% in July compared with the same
month a year earlier, which was similar to the rate of
growth observed since March. Of the 21 major commodity
aggregations, 14 advanced and 6 declined, much the same
pattern as in June.  Compared with July 2010, the IPPI's increase was driven
mainly by higher prices for petroleum and coal products
(+31.9%) and primary metal products (+13.6%).  Year over year, petroleum and coal products remained on
an upward trend, posting gains since November 2009. The
increase in July was the largest during this period of
growth.  The largest contributors to the advance in primary
metal products were precious metals, particularly silver
and platinum (+77.1%), and precious metal basic
manufactured shapes (+66.8%). Copper (+27.3%) and aluminum
products (+6.8%) also contributed to the advance.  Chemical products (+9.3%) and fruits, vegetables and
feeds (+7.2%) made smaller contributions to the year-over-
year IPPI increase in July.  In July, the 9.1% year-over-year increase in the value
of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar slowed
the advance of the IPPI. Without the impact of the
exchange rate, the IPPI would have risen 7.0% instead of
5.1%.  The year-over-year increase of the IPPI in July was
moderated by lower prices for motor vehicles and other
transportation equipment (-4.6%), pulp and paper products
(-3.6%) and lumber and other wood products (-2.4%).  Excluding petroleum and coal prices, the year-over-year
IPPI would have increased 2.0% in July, a slower growth
rate than in June (+2.5%). This continues the upward trend
that began in May 2010.  RMPI: Third consecutive monthly decline  The RMPI decreased by 1.2% in July, after falling 5.1%
in May and 2.4% in June. The decline in July was the third
straight monthly decrease.  The decline of the RMPI was led by mineral fuels 
(-2.2%). Crude oil fell 2.5% in July, following declines of
8.9% in May and 5.3% in June. Demand for crude petroleum
was softened by uncertainties about global prospects for
growth.  Vegetable products (-2.5%) and wood (-2.5%) also
declined in July. Prices for grain, especially wheat 
(-9.7%), were pulled down by the events driving global
demand, including the end of the ban on grain exports from
 Russia  and the arrival of much-needed rain for North
American and Asian crops. Wood prices were affected by an
increase in the inventory of houses for sale in the  United
States , as housing sales fell for a third consecutive
month.  The RMPI's decline in July was slowed by higher prices
for animals and animal products (+1.3%) and non-ferrous
metals (+0.9%).  Excluding mineral fuels, the RMPI would have declined
0.1% in July, after rising 0.1% in June.  Compared with the same month a year earlier, the RMPI
was up 19.4% in July, following advances of 25.6% in May
and 23.1% in June. The main factors in the year-over-year
increase in the RMPI in July were higher prices for
mineral fuels (+22.2%), non-ferrous metals (+26.1%),
vegetable products (+35.5%) and animals and animal
products (+9.6%).  Year over year, excluding mineral fuels, the RMPI would
have risen 16.9% in July compared with 19.0% in June.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally unadjusted and
usually subject to revision for a period of six months
(for example, when the July index is released, the index
for the previous January becomes final).  The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) reflects the
prices that producers in  Canada  receive as the goods leave
the plant gate. It does not reflect what the consumer
pays. Unlike the  Consumer Price Index , the IPPI excludes
indirect taxes and all the costs that occur between the
time a good leaves the plant and the time the final user
takes possession of it, including transportation,
wholesale and retail costs.  Canadian producers export many goods. They often
indicate their prices in foreign currencies, especially in
US dollars, which are then converted into Canadian
dollars. In particular, this is the case for motor
vehicles, pulp, paper and wood products. Therefore, a rise
or fall in the value of the Canadian dollar against its US
counterpart affects the IPPI. But the conversion into
Canadian dollars only reflects how respondents provide
their prices. Moreover, this is not a measure that takes
into account the full effect of exchange rates, since that
is a more difficult analytical task.  The conversion of prices received in US dollars is
based on the average monthly exchange rate (noon spot
rate) established by the  Bank of Canada , and it is
available on CANSIM in table 176-0064 (series v37426).
Monthly and annual variations in the exchange rate, as
described in the text, are calculated according to the
indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for example,
CAN$1 = US$X).  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) reflects the
prices paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw
materials. Many of those prices are set on the world
market. However, as few prices are denominated in foreign
currencies, their conversion into Canadian dollars has
only a minor effect on the calculation of the RMPI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
