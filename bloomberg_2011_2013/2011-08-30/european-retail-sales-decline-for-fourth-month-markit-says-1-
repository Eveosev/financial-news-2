European retail sales declined for a
fourth month in August as shoppers in France and  Italy  cut
spending, according to a Markit Economics indicator.  A gauge of euro-area retail sales fell to 48, when adjusted
for seasonal swings, London-based Markit Economics said today in
a statement without giving a July figure. The index is based on
a survey of more than 1,000 executives and a reading below 50
indicates contraction.  Europe ’s economy may struggle to gather strength after
cooling more than economists forecast in the second quarter as
governments step up budget cuts to contain the region’s fiscal
crisis. European economic confidence dropped to the lowest in
more than a year in August, led by a slump in household
sentiment, the European Commission in Brussels said today.  “Euro-zone retailers continued to endure challenging
conditions midway through the third quarter,” said Trevor
Balchin, senior economist at Markit, in the statement. “The
divergence between  Germany  and Italy remains stark, while French
retailers are showing signs of slipping into a sustained period
of falling sales.”  In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, retailers reported
the biggest monthly sales gain since April, Markit said. French
sales dropped for a third month, while Italy’s declined for a
sixth straight month, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
