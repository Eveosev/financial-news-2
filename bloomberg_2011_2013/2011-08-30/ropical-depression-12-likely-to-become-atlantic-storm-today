Tropical Storm Katia formed today
off the Cape Verde Islands, matching the total for named storms
in an average  hurricane season  with three months to go, the U.S.
National Hurricane Center said.  Katia, moving west-northwest at 17 miles (28 kilometers)
per hour with 40 mph winds, is likely to strengthen to “near-
hurricane status” late tomorrow or early on Sept. 1, the NHC
said in an  advisory  at 5 a.m. Atlantic standard time. It is 535
miles west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands and currently
presents no threat to land, it said.  “Steady intensification should commence as the cyclone
moves over progressively higher ocean heat content”  this
afternoon, the NHC said. The forecast  path  shows Katia could
reach “major” hurricane status late this weekend north and
east of  Puerto Rico .  Katia is the 11th named storm of this  Atlantic hurricane
season , which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Eleven storms is
about the  average  number of named storms for an entire hurricane
season, according to the Miami-based center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
