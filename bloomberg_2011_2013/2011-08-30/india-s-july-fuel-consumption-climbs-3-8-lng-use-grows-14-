India ’s oil-product consumption rose
in July, recovering from the slowest pace in six months, as a
weaker-than-expected monsoon boosted diesel use to pump water in
farms. Liquefied natural gas sales gained 14 percent.  Fuel consumption climbed 3.8 percent from a year earlier to
12.05 million metric tons, according to preliminary government
data. That compares with 2.1 percent growth in June. Diesel,
which accounted for about 42 percent of sales, rose 5.4 percent
to 5.07 million tons and gasoline gained 4.8 percent to 1.21
million tons.  Monsoon rainfall, the main source of water for India’s 235
million farmers, was 86 percent of a 50-year average in July,
traditionally the wettest month of the season, the  India
Meteorological Department  said. The country was forecast to
receive 93 percent of the average last month, according to the
weather bureau.  Use of LNG, which is imported, continued to rise after
natural gas output from the KG-D6 field, the nation’s biggest
deposit, dropped 17 percent from about 60 million cubic meters a
day last year. Sales of LNG climbed to 853,500 tons.  Jet-fuel sales grew 12.2 percent to 450,200 tons and
liquefied petroleum gas, used as cooking fuel and to power
vehicles, rose 7.2 percent to 1.21 million tons. Consumption of
kerosene declined 9.8 percent to 689,000 tons. Naphtha, a
chemical feedstock, fell 3.2 percent to 764,900 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
