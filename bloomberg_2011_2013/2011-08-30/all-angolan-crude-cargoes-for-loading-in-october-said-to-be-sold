All Angolan crude oil cargoes for
loading in October have been sold, said three traders who
participate in the market.  About 40 percent will be shipped to  China , said the people,
who declined to be identified because they aren’t authorized to
speak on the matter.  Angola , Africa’s second-largest oil producer, is scheduled
to export 53 cargoes totaling 50.9 million barrels, or 1.64
million barrels a day, in October, according to loading programs
obtained by Bloomberg News. Cargo sizes range from 920,000 to 1
million barrels.  Last month, China bought 20 cargoes, or 38 percent, of
September loading crude, according to a survey of seven traders
involved in the transactions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
