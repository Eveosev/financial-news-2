South African bonds extended gains,
driving four-year yields to record lows, after economic growth
slowed more than economists’ expectations in the second quarter,
fueling speculation the central bank may cut rates.  The 13.5 percent notes due 2015 climbed 25 cents to 124.44
rand, driving the yield down seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 6.50 percent as of 12:43 p.m. in
Johannesburg, the lowest level on a closing basis on record. The
6.75 percent securities due 2021 soared 57 cents to 93.81 rand,
cutting the yield nine basis points to 7.67 percent.  Africa’s biggest economy expanded an annualized 1.3 percent
in the second quarter, its slowest pace in almost two years, as
manufacturing and mining output plunged. Gross domestic product
growth eased from a revised 4.5 percent in the first quarter,
Statistics  South Africa  said. The median estimate of 18
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for an expansion of 1.6
percent.  “Today’s GDP figures confirm that the economy slowed
sharply in the second quarter,” Nedbank Group Ltd. analysts led
by Dennis Dykes wrote in an e-mailed note. “At the monetary
policy committee’s next meeting in September, the mounting
downside risks to economic growth are likely to dominate,
outweighing the upside risks to inflation.”  The  Reserve Bank  has kept its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 5.5 percent this year to help boost the recovery in
the nation’s economy, even as price pressures increased. The
central bank will “act appropriately” if a sustained slowdown
in the global economy dragged back domestic growth, Governor
Gill Marcus said on Aug. 23.  Nedbank expects the central bank to leave rates on hold
until May 2012, though the risk of a rate cut has increased, the
analysts said.  Forward-rate agreements starting in May dropped four basis
points today to 5.32 percent, the lowest in at least 10 years.
