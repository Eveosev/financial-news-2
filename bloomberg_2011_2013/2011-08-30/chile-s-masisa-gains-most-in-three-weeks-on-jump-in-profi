Masisa SA (MASISA) , the Chilean wood panels
producer, rose the most in three weeks after reporting yesterday
a 400 percent increase in second-quarter profit.  Masisa rose 5.8 percent to 55 pesos at 12:22 p.m. New York
time, the largest increase on an intraday basis since Aug. 10,
and its second day of gains. Masisa, which has operations in
 Brazil ,  Mexico , Argentina, Chile and other Latin American
countries, also led gains among members of the IPSA index, which
rose 0.8 percent to 4,249.62.  Masisa reported profit in the second quarter reached $11.3
million, up from $2.2 million a year earlier, according to a
filing posted yesterday after the close of the market on the
website of  Chile ’s securities regulator.  The improvement was due to higher sales of wood panels in
the countries where it operates, Masisa said in an accompanying
statement. This year’s figures also benefited from a low base of
comparison, as second-quarter 2010 results were affected by an
earthquake in Chile and forest fires in Chile and Venezuela, the
company said.  “The results were good, the company showed improvements in
margins and the market is reacting to that,” Juan Carlos Delgado, an analyst at Santiago-based brokerage firm Larrain
Vial SA, said today in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
