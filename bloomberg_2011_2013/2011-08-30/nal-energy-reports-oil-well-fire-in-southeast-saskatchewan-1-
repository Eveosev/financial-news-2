NAL Energy Corp. said itâ€™s
responding to a fire at an oil-production plant in southeast
Saskatchewan.  The blaze was reported at about 7 p.m. local time at the
Star Valley field, approximately 90 kilometers (56 miles)
northeast of the town of Estevan, the Calgary-based company said
in a statement. The fire affects the equivalent of about 300
barrels a day of oil output.  NAL is drilling horizontal wells in Star Valley to tap
shale oil formations. The cause of the incident is unknown, the
company said. Workers are trying to contain the situation, the
company said.  The company produced the equivalent of about 29,000 barrels
of oil a day in July, according to an Aug. 9 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
