Returns from shipping Middle East
crude oil to  Asia , the worldâ€™s busiest route for supertankers,
fell to the lowest level in seven days, as a surplus of
available tankers persists.  Daily rental income for very large crude carriers on the
benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-Japan voyage plunged to minus $207,
according to the  Baltic Exchange  in London. Earnings first
turned negative on Aug. 1, according to the exchange, and have
only been positive for seven days in this month.  Charter rates for VLCCs, each able to haul 2 million
barrels of crude, on the benchmark voyage were little changed at
47.32 Worldscale points, according to the exchange. The points
are a percentage of a nominal rate, or flat rate, for more than
320,000 specific routes. Flat rates for every voyage, quoted in
U.S. dollars a ton, are revised annually by the Worldscale
Association in  London  to reflect changing fuel costs, port
tariffs and exchange rates.  Earnings can only be increased by reducing speed on a
return journey after a vessel has unloaded its cargo, saving
fuel costs. The price of ship fuel, or bunkers, has risen 28
percent this year to $649.89 a metric ton, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg from 25 ports worldwide.  The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, an overall measure of
shipping crude oil that includes vessels smaller than VLCCs,
declined 1.6 percent to 682 points, according to the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
