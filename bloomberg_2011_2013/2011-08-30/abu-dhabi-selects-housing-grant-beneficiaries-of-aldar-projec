An Abu Dhabi government committee is
preparing a list of beneficiaries of a housing grant for 4,857
residential villas Aldar Properties PJSC, the emirate’s biggest
real-estate company, is building.  The 12.5 million square-meter (135 million square-foot)
plot will house more than 60,000 people in the new al-Falah
residential neighborhood, according to an e-mailed statement
received from Aldar, the main developer.  The first phase of the project will be completed by the
beginning of next year and the remainder by the end of 2012,
Jabar al-Suwaidi, chairman of the emirate’s housing allocation
committee, was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
