The U.K. Electoral Commission, which
regulates political parties, said it won’t open an investigation
into payments made by  News Corp. (NWSA)  to former  Conservative Party 
director of communications  Andy Coulson  after he quit as News of
the World editor in 2007.  Coulson left the newspaper at the start of that year after
one of his reporters was convicted of phone-hacking. According
to a BBC report Aug. 22, when he joined the Conservatives
several months later, he was still receiving a pay-off from his
former employers. The Conservative Party said Aug. 23 it didn’t
know about the arrangement.  Labour lawmaker Tom Watson asked the commission to
investigate, arguing that the payments amounted to an undeclared
donation.  “The commission has considered the allegations and
concluded there’s no evidence of a breach of the Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Act,” the commission said
today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
