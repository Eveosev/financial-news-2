South Africa ’s ruling  African
National Congress  won’t be “intimidated” into dropping its
disciplinary action against Youth League leader  Julius Malema 
after his supporters clashed with police near the ANC’s
headquarters today, the party’s spokesman, Jackson Mthembu,
said.  The ANC “condemns” the violence by protesters, who threw
stones and bottles at police, Mthembu said in a telephone
interview from Johannesburg. The Youth League, which called on
members to march to the ANC office’s today to support Malema,
must accept responsibility for the violence, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
