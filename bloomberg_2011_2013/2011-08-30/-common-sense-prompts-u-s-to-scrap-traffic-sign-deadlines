Most requirements for U.S. local
governments to replace stop signs and other traffic markers by
specific dates will be scrapped after hundreds of cash-strapped
municipalities complained, the Transportation Department said.  The  Federal Highway Administration  will now allow states to
replace the signs when they wear out, it said in a press release
today. Forty-six deadlines, including timetables for minimum
reflectivity and larger lettering, will be eliminated.  The changes may affect companies like  3M Co. (MMM) , based in  St.
Paul ,  Minnesota , which has a unit devoted to traffic safety
items like reflective sheeting and tape.  “A specific deadline for replacing street signs makes no
sense and would have cost communities across America millions of
dollars in unnecessary expenses,” Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. “After speaking with local and
state officials across the country, we are proposing to
eliminate these burdensome regulations. It’s just plain common
sense.”  The highway administration posted a notice about the rule
changes in the Federal Register today.  The administration, part of LaHood’s department, proposed
the changes in 2009. In a November 2010  notice  seeking comments,
it called the deadlines “a reasonable balance of the safety
benefits afforded by uniformity of traffic control devices and
the economic costs to agencies to achieve compliance.”  States and cities are struggling with diminished tax
collections and the end of additional money from President
Barack Obama’s 2009 economic stimulus bill.  ‘Perfectly Good’ Signs  Over the past four years, states have been forced to use
spending cuts and tax increases to eliminate budget gaps of more
than $500 billion, according to the  Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities . Census data show that property taxes, which flow
largely to localities, dropped during the past two quarters.  “States, cities and towns should not be required to spend
money that they don’t have to replace perfectly good street
signs,” Michelle Markiewicz Qualkinbush, the mayor of Calumet
City,  Illinois , wrote in comments to the highway administration
in January.  The department has not estimated how much the rules would
cost all municipalities.  Milwaukee , in comments to the
department, estimated it would cost the city $3.4 million to
meet the deadlines.  The changes were determined by a government-wide review
initiated in January by Obama to change or remove rules that
were unnecessary, out-of-date, excessively burdensome or too
costly, according to the highway administration.  Some Deadlines Stay  Other deadlines to be eliminated include increasing the
size of warning signs including ‘Pass With Care,’ ‘One Way’, Low
Clearance’ and ‘Advance Grade Crossing.’  Twelve deadlines would remain in effect for “sign upgrades
that are critical to public safety,” according to the
Transportation Department. Those include installing ‘One Way’
signs at intersections with divided highways or one-way streets,
and requiring ‘Stop’ and ‘Yield’ signs be added at railroad
crossings without train-activated gates or flashing lights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
