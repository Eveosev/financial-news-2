Thailand ’s government will continue
to promote the use of  alternative energy  and will consider ways
to lower prices of ethanol-blended gasohol, Prime Minister
Yingluck Shinawatra said.  Gasohol should be cheaper than gasoline by at least 2 baht
per liter, Yingluck told reporters today.  The government will maintain fiscal discipline even as it
introduces measures to lower fuel costs for consumers, she said.  The government’s energy policy committee will meet later
today to discuss ways to reduce gasohol prices, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
