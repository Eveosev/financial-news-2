(Corrects name of one of bidding ports in first
paragraph.)  Antwerp and Rotterdam are jockeying
for a stake in Duisburg harbor as WestLB AG begins talks with
the European Commission about part-privatization of the world’s
biggest inland port, the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Hamburger Hafen und Logistik AG and Eurogate GmbH may team
up with Dortmund to submit an offer in an effort to stop the
Dutch and Belgian ports from gaining a stronger foothold in the
German hinterland, the newspaper said.  WestLB is overseeing the tender, which could begin in the
fall, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
