As many as seven foreign and Greek
investors have expressed interest in acquiring a 50.4 percent
stake in the  Greek Cooperative Cigarette Manufacturing Co .,
known as Sekap,  Euro2day  reported.  Imperial Tobacco Group Plc (IMT)  and India’s BBM Bommidala Group
are among the interested parties, the Athens-based financial
website said, without citing anyone.  Agricultural Bank of Greece (ATE)  SA earlier this month called
for expressions of interest in its 50.4 percent stake in Sekap
as part of a plan to divest itself of units unrelated to
banking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
