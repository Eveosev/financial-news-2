Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and OAO Rosneft,
Russia’s largest oil producer, entered a partnership that may
generate as much as $500 billion of investments, Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin  said.  Exxon and Rosneft agreed on a $3.2 billion exploration
project in Russia’s Arctic waters and Black Sea, the companies
said today in a statement. The Moscow-based explorer may also
gain projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Texas, Putin said today
in Sochi.  Exxon will explore the Arctic Kara Sea blocks that Rosneft
had planned to develop with  BP Plc (BP/)  before that agreement fell
apart earlier this year.  Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson attended
the signing between Neil Duffin, the company’s president for
development, and Rosneft CEO Eduard Khudainatov.  Exxon and Rosneft signed on Jan. 27 a preliminary accord
for a $1 billion exploration project in the  Black Sea ’s
deepwater Tuapse Trough.  To contact the reporter on this story:
