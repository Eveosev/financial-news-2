Sailav Kaji, chief strategist at
Padmakshi Financial Services Ltd., comments on the Indian gross
domestic product numbers. Kaji spoke by phone from Mumbai.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index rose 1.2 percent
to 16,616.70 at 11:08 a.m. Mumbai time, extending its steepest
rally yesterday since May 2009.  India’s economy  grew 7.7 percent in the three months ended
June 30 from a year earlier, the nation’s  Central Statistics
Office  said in a statement in  New Delhi  today. The median of 26
estimates in a Bloomberg survey was for a 7.6 percent increase.  “The GDP figures are good for the markets. Farm growth has
been good and the services sector has continued its growth. The
figures are better than initial expectations. Considering
monsoon has been normal, farm productivity has been good.”  “The manufacturing sector remained flat due to high
 interest rates . Investors should adopt a wait and watch
approach. Construction and automobile sectors look attractive.
Rural income will rise and farm productivity will look better.
The market has not slowed like people thought.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
