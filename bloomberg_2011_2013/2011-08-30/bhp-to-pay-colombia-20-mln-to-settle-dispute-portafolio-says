BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the worldâ€™s
largest mining company, agreed to pay the Colombian government
an additional 35.3 billion pesos ($19.7 million) to settle a
nickel mine royalties dispute,  Portafolio newspaper  said.  The agreement paves the way for BHP to renew a contract to
operate the Cerro Matoso nickel mine for 30 years, the Bogota-
based newspaper said, citing Mines and Energy Minister Carlos
Rodado. The Colombian mine has 21 million tons of nickel and
accounts for about 4 percent of global output, Portafolio said,
citing government figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
