Novell Inc. (NOVL)  owns the copyrights of
early versions of the Unix computer operating system, not SCO
Group Inc., a federal appeals court ruled, upholding a jury
verdict.  The Denver-based  court  today also affirmed a lower-court
ruling that Novell had the right to prevent SCO from terminating
a Unix license issued before Novell sold part of its Unix
business to SCO in 1995.  “Novell’s board of directors adopted a resolution
approving the sale, which specifically mentioned the copyrights
were to be retained by Novell,” the judges said in the opinion.  This was the second time the appeals court ruled on this
case. In the first appeal it reversed a lower-court ruling in
Novell’s favor and sent the case back. After a two-week trial,
the jury ruled Novell owned the copyrights. SCO appealed.  A spokeswoman for Linden, Utah-based SCO, Chantell Ferrin,
didn’t immediately reply to messages seeking comment.  The case is SCO Group v. Novell, 10-4122.  U.S. Court of
Appeals  for the 10th Circuit (Denver).  To contact the reporter on this story:
