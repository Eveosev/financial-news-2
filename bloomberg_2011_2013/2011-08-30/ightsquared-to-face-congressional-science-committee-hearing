Philip Falcone ’s proposed
LightSquared wireless service faces a hearing Sept. 8 before the
U.S. House Science, Space and Technology Committee, the panel
announced today.  Witnesses at the  hearing , entitled “Impacts of the
LightSquared Network on Federal Science Activities,” are to
include officials from the Transportation Department and the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, according to a
notice from the committee distributed by e-mail.  LightSquared is seeking regulators’ approval to build a $15
billion wholesale network of 40,000 base stations using airwaves
previously reserved mainly for satellites. Makers and users of
global-positioning system devices, which rely on satellite
signals, say LightSquared would disrupt navigation equipment on
aircraft, boats, tractors and automobiles.  The Federal Communications Commission is considering
Reston, Virginia-based LightSquared’s proposal.  -- Editors: Michael Shepard, Allan Holmes  To contact the reporter on this story:
