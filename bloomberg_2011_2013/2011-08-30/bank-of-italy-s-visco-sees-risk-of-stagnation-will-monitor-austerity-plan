Bank of Italy Deputy Director
General Ignazio Visco said the country is at risk of economic
stagnation and that the central bank will closely monitor the
government’s austerity plan.  Visco, speaking in testimony before the Senate in  Rome ,
said Italy’s debt has been the country’s biggest problem for
three decades. Gross domestic product growth may be less than 1
percent this year, he said, and weaker next year.  The country’s weak growth makes deficit and debt goals
“difficult,” Visco said, and the austerity plan will also
affect growth.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
