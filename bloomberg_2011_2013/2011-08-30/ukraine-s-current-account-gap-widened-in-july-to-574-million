Ukraine’s current-account deficit
widened in July from the previous month, the central bank said.  The gap reached $574 million in July, compared with a
revised $281 million a month earlier, the Kiev-based
 Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy  said in a statement on its  website 
today.  The central bank revised the second-quarter current account
deficit to $1.45 billion from $1.22 billion estimated on Aug. 1.
This compares with a gap of $1.30 billion in the first quarter.  The current-account deficit widened to $3.32 billion in the
first seven months of the year compared with a surplus of $313
million a year earlier, the statement said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
