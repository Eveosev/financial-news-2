Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP) , an oil
and gas explorer working in northern  Iraq , said it isn’t in
talks to sell the company.  The U.K.’s Sunday Times reported on Aug. 28 that the
company could fetch as much as 1.4 billion pounds ($2.3
billion), about a 40 percent premium on its current market
value, after making two discoveries in Kurdistan.  “The board of Gulf Keystone is confident that it has built
an enviable asset base in Kurdistan, with significant further
upside potential,” Gulf Keystone Chief Executive Officer Todd Kozel said in a statement today. “We consider the true value of
the company to be significantly above any figures quoted in
recent press articles.”  Gulf Keystone rose as much as 8.4 percent and traded up 3.8
percent at 135.5 pence as of 8:46 a.m. in  London .  Shares have gained 14 percent since Aug. 10, when the
company said an outside evaluation of its Sheikh Adi-1 well
indicated one billion to three billion barrels of gross oil in
place. Kozel owns about 2 percent of the company, according to
Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
