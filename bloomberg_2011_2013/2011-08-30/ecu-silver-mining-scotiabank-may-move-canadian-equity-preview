Canadian stocks rose for a third
day, led by precious-metals producers, as gold and silver gained
after an index of U.S. consumer confidence dropped to its lowest
level since April 2009.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest gold producer,
advanced 1.6 percent after the U.S. Federal Reserve said some
policy makers favored more stimulus.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ,
 Canada ’s third-biggest lender by assets, climbed 2.2 percent
after reporting earnings that beat the average analyst estimate.
BlackBerry maker  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  increased 6.4 percent,
rallying for a second day after an analyst at Macquarie Group
Ltd. raised his price estimate on the shares.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index rose 129.86
points, or 1 percent, to 12,634.71. Precious-metal prices
rallied on investor demand for a haven after the Conference
Board’s index had the biggest point drop since October 2008 as
the Americans’ outlooks for employment and incomes soured.  “You have a situation where stimulus could be bad for the
currency and good for gold,” Daniel L. Bain, chief investment
officer at Thornmark Asset Management Inc. in Toronto, said in a
telephone interview. Bain oversees C$400 million ($409 million).
“You also have the possibility for a weaker economy, which
would also be bad for the currency and good for gold.”  The S&P/TSX has lost 2.4 percent this month, the second-
smallest decline among major developed-market stock benchmarks
behind  New Zealand ’s. Gold stocks in the index have jumped 12
percent, which would be their biggest monthly advance in a year,
as precious metals climbed on concern the global economic
recovery is slowing.  U.S. Stimulus  “A few members” of the  Federal Open Market Committee 
sought more aggressive action to stimulate the economy and lower
unemployment at the group’s Aug. 9 meeting, the central bank
said today. The Fed pledged to keep its key  interest rate  at a
record low until mid-2013 at that meeting.  Earlier today, the European Commission said its index of
executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-country euro region
dropped the most since December 2008.  Gold rose 2.1 percent in  New York . Barrick gained 1.6

metals company by market value, increased 2.3 percent to C$38.77
as silver surged 2.1 percent.  Silvercorp Metals Inc. (SVM) , which
operates in  China , jumped 11 percent, the most since November,
to C$8.72.  Bank Profit  Scotiabank increased 2.2 percent to C$53.50 after its
third-quarter profit surpassed the average estimate in a
Bloomberg survey by 2.2 percent, excluding certain items.  National Bank of Canada (NA) , the country’s sixth-biggest lender
by assets, climbed 1.3 percent to C$71.50. Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce, which is scheduled to disclose third-quarter
earnings tomorrow, rallied 1.6 percent to C$73.06.  RIM gained 6.4 percent to C$31.91, extending its August
surge to 33 percent. The company is heading for its biggest
monthly advance since April 2009 as analysts including Kevin Smithen of Macquarie and Shaw Wu of Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc.
have said that its new smartphones may help stop the long-term
decline in its share price. Shares of the Waterloo, Ontario-
based company remain down 45 percent on the year.  Energy stocks advanced as crude oil futures increased 1.9
percent.  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) , Canada’s fifth-largest energy
