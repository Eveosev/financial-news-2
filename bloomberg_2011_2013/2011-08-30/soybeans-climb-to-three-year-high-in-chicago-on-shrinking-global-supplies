Soybean futures jumped to a three-
year high on speculation that adverse weather will hamper
production in the U.S. and  Brazil , the world’s biggest growers.  More than a quarter of the Midwest will remain too dry for
soybean pods to fill with beans in the next two weeks even after
today’s rain in parts of  Iowa , northern Illinois and Wisconsin,
the Commodity Weather Group LLC said. Lack of precipitation in
northern and central Brazil has depleted soil moisture, which is
unlikely to be replenished before seeding starts in mid-
September, according to Oil World, a Hamburg-based researcher.  “Rains are going to miss most of the eastern Midwest, and
that means lower yields,” Greg Grow, the director of
agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said
by telephone. “People are getting worried that dry weather in
Brazil and  Argentina  will further cut world supplies.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 10 cents, or 0.7
percent, to close at $14.57 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. The oilseed has gained 4.6 percent in three
sessions, the biggest such gain since March 21. Earlier, the
price touched $14.585, the highest for the most-active contract
since July 2008.  Soybeans are the second-biggest U.S. crop, valued in 2010
at $38.9 billion, government figures show. Corn is the biggest
at a $66.7 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
