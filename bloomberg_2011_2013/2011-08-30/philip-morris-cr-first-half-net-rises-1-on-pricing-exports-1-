Philip Morris CR AS (TABAK) , the  Czech
Republic ’s largest cigarette manufacturer, said first-half
profit rose 1 percent as the company boosted exports and
benefited from favorable pricing.  Net income increased to 1.13 billion koruna ($68.1 million)
from a year ago, the Kutna Hora, Czech Republic-based company
said in a statement on its website. Revenue without taxes
advanced 1.5 percent to 5.6 billion koruna as the company
exported more to European Union nations other than Slovakia and
experienced favorable pricing after price increases in 2010 and
the first six months of 2011, it said.  Domestic shipments fell 5.8 percent as Philip Morris CR’s
market share declined to 52.3 percent at the end of the first
half, with customers dropping its lower-cost brands. The
company’s market share and shipments in neighboring Slovakia
also dropped.  The effect of new taxes on the cigarette industry in the EU
and the “underlying market trend,” unemployment and the shift
to lower-cost brands makes the rest of the year “difficult to
determine” in terms of the business, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
