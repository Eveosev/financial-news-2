Harvesting of the 2011-12 coffee
crop in  Vietnam , the largest producer of the robusta variety,
may start a month earlier than usual due to favorable weather,
according to  ABN Amro  Bank NV and researcher VM Group.  The Southeast Asian will produce 21.5 million 60 kilogram
(132.3 pound) bags of robusta beans next season and 400,000 60
kilogram bags of arabica coffee, ABN Amro and VM Group estimated
in a report e-mailed today. That compares with a robusta output
of 20 million bags and 400,000 bags of arabica in the current
season, according to the report.  “Fresh beans from the new Vietnamese robusta crop are
expected to start filtering through the market in late October,
a month earlier than usual following a season of particularly
favorable growing weather,” analysts led by Gary Mead, of VM
Group, wrote in the report.  The next crop will also benefit from farmers’ “improved
financial standing” and “good prices,” according to the
report. Expectations of a large crop have led the premium for
Vietnamese coffee to fall to $110 a metric ton over the price on
NYSE Liffe in  London  this month from $200 a ton, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
