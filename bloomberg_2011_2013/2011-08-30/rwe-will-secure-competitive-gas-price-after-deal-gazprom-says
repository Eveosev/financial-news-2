RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany ’s second-biggest
utility, will be able to secure natural gas at “competitive
prices” after it finishes setting up a joint power venture with
OAO Gazprom, according to the state-run Russian gas exporter.  Gazprom and RWE began talks on forming the venture for
power plants in Germany, the U.K., Netherlands, Belgium and
Luxemburg, Andrei Chernoshchekov, an official at the Russian
company’s foreign economic department, said on a call today.  Gazprom is in arbitration with RWE, its main partner for
supplying the  Czech Republic , and EON AG, the biggest utility in
Germany, over its prices for gas. The Moscow-based gas supplier
links its fees to crude and oil products, while RWE and EON aim
to bring them closer to market prices for immediate delivery.  “After the commercial implementation of this project, RWE
will be able to secure reliable supplies of natural gas at
competitive prices,” Chernoshchekov said.  RWE and Gazprom agreed in July to study a venture covering
current and new gas and coal power plants in the five countries,
with talks to be exclusive for three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
