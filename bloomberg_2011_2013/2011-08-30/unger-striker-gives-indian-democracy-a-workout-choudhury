There was jubilation and relief across India on Aug. 28, when a  septuagenarian finally accepted an offer of honey and coconut water  from two children after the 12th day of what had probably been the most prominent and widely supported hunger fast since Independence. Anna Hazare , the anti-graft crusader who on Aug. 16 embarked on the protest  to pressure the government to table a strong anti-corruption measure, the Jan Lokpal Bill , and the millions of Indians who came out in his support, claimed a victory as the government appeared to give in to their demands. Hazare had been persistent: it was his second fast of the year,  following one in April . "The price of liberty is eternal vigilance." This old saw was proclaimed last week in different versions and different languages on streets, stages and television studios all around the country. It certainly was the main theme on the grounds of  New Delhi's Ramlila Maidan , where thousands of people gathered all week to get a glimpse of Hazare and to hear the speeches of prominent members of his team, interspersed with songs, skits, and prayers. In a year of street protests worldwide, this one -- although dismissed by its critics as a subversion of democracy and  hostile to the political class as a whole  -- felt like a mass democratic re-education movement, aiming to restore the balance of power between  India 's disaffected citizens and its supine Parliament, which has far too often in recent times projected a sense of a private club that feasts on power and entitlement. A prominent force in the campaign was the  mass media , which strongly supported Hazare and carried his message. The government capitulated after taking a battering in Parliament  from the opposition  and outside it from citizens and prominent figures in Indian public life, including social activists, swamis (godmen), and film stars. Among the controversial steps taken by authorities was the arrest of Hazare on the first day of his fast and his confinement for three days in  New Delhi 's Tihar Jail,  a measure completely out of proportion to the potential threat posed by his non-violent protest. As the agitation grew in size and strength, the government was forced to discard the advice of the two prominent lawyers in its ranks, Home Minister P.Chidambaram and Minister of Human Resource Development Kapil Sibal, who had taken a hard line in the negotiations. Instead, officials turned to less belligerent figures, such as Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  and Minister of Science and Technology  Vilasrao Deshmukh . On the evening of Aug. 27, Deshmukh, who was newly appointed by the government to negotiate with Hazare and his colleagues, delivered to the group  a letter from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  that informed him that both houses of Parliament had, in a special session, agreed to the three contentious demands. Parliament would pass on to the Parliamentary Standing Committee appointed to scrutinize various drafts of the bill this " sense of the House ." After this, Hazare agreed to call off his fast,  even though he noted : "This victory of Jan Lokpal bill is a partial victory. A full victory is yet to be achieved." But did the government concede anything concrete to the protestors? The weekly magazine Tehelka asked " Was Anna Hazare given a placebo? " and its correspondent Iftikhar Gilani  wrote : It might be said that Hazare's victory was more general than specific, significant less for what it managed to wrest in the realm of policy than for what it achieved in terms of mass mobilization against corruption and an upsurge of political consciousness, particularly among the Indian  middle classes , which have  long been derided  for their political apathy. Writing in the Indian Express,  Pratap Bhanu Mehta observed : And in a cover story in Tehelka called " The Troopers Who Triggered The Storm ," the journalist Revati Laul supplied a fascinating account of how the Hazare campaign had gathered force since its principal figures first came together late last year. Laul drew attention to the campaign's backroom staff, which bore the burden of its organizational and financial requirements and prepared a public-relations campaign that, channeling media from street posters to text messages and Twitter, knocked out the government apparatus. One such person was a man in his twenties, Ram Kumar Jha: Among the sidelights of the drama was a  rare and widely watched speech  in Parliament by  Rahul Gandhi , the son of the Congress Party president  Sonia Gandhi  and the leader of the Youth Congress, who is widely assumed to be the prime-minister-in-waiting. Gandhi's oration was  a piece of political theatre  designed to showcase the speaker more than the issue at hand. He suggested that the Lokpal be made a constitutional body, and later unwisely said he had come up with " a game-changing idea ." Gandhi is thought to be, and indeed is  presented by his supporters  as the politician who will lead both the Congress Party and India's youth boldly into the future. But his current disconnect from the pulse of public opinion, rivaling that of the Congress Party, was analyzed by the journalist Ashok Malik in an essay called " Stumped? ": Malik also laid out the reasons for the Congress Party's decline, and compared the movement to other pan-Indian agitations of decades past: In a piece titled " Lokpal Bill: What Next? " the Times of India suggested that it was unlikely that the measure would be presented to Parliament before the  winter session , which means the government has bought itself a breather. The moot question is whether it is genuinely open to the multiple drafts of the bill and the mass of suggestions from different quarters that will now be considered by the Standing Committee before it sends a revised bill back to Parliament. A trenchant overview of the drawn-out crisis was supplied by the Hindu,  which said in an editorial : All things considered, this was an excellent workout for Indian democracy, both in the specific sense of democratic procedure and law-making and the general sense of citizenship and robust debate in the public sphere.
