Honda Motor Co.,  Japan ’s third-
largest carmaker, is in talks with the Vietnamese government
over claims that its local unit owes “back taxes” from
importing parts to the country.  The company’s unit in  Vietnam  was contacted by tax
authorities there about the claim, Honda spokesman Tomohiro
Okada said by phone today.  “We have received information on back taxes in Vietnam for
the import of our four-wheel parts, but because discussions are
still ongoing with the Vietnam tax agency, we cannot announce
any details right now,” Okada said.  The carmaker is planning to build a factory for two-wheel
vehicle assembly in Vietnam by the end of 2012 and has no plans
to leave the country, Okada said.  The online newswire VnExpress reported earlier today that
the Japanese Embassy in Hanoi asked the Vietnamese government to
help resolve a dispute over $160 million in taxes which local
customs authorities say the local unit owes. The report cited a
letter written by Hiroshi Kitamura, a Japanese embassy official,
to the  Finance Ministry  and customs department.  Lo Thi Nhu, the head of the import-export tax division of
Vietnam’s customs authority, said she was in a meeting when
reached on her mobile phone and could not immediately comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
