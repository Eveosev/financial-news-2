UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s largest bank,
cut three jobs in its Canadian financial-adviser network as it
consolidates operations in the country.  Mike Ralph, Paul de la Roche and Aaron Martin, who were
based in Toronto left the firm, according to UBS spokeswoman
 Karina Byrne , in an e-mailed statement from New York.  UBS Chief Executive Officer Oswald Gruebel has said he
plans to reduce annual costs by about 2 billion Swiss francs
($2.44 billion) by the end of 2013. The bank said last week it
will eliminate about 3,500 jobs, or 5.3 percent of its
workforce.  Byrne said the moves don’t diminish the commitment to
Canada, and the firm will retain “senior advisers with the most
experience to best represent UBS in the Canadian market.” The
firm now has 26 advisers across the country, she said.  In May, UBS fired three of its Canadian staff including
Grant Rasmussen, the president and chief executive officer of
 wealth management , as part of a reorganization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
