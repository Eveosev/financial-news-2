The rate  Kenya ’s central bank
applies to discount-window loans plunged almost 12 percentage
points after the regulator introduced a new method of
calculating the charge yesterday, Reuters reported, citing a
central bank document.  The Central Bank of Kenya’s overnight rate dropped to 19.83
percent yesterday, from 31.4 percent on Aug. 26 before the new
guidelines took effect, the  news agency  reported.  Nancy Sang, a spokeswoman for the central bank, said she
couldn’t verify the report when called by Bloomberg.  Kenya’s central bank stopped publishing its overnight
lending rate on Aug. 19 and said it will only reveal the figures
to borrowers when they seek funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
