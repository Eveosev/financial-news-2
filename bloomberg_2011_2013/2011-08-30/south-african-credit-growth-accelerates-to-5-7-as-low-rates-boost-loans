South African credit growth
unexpectedly accelerated to 5.7 percent in July as the lowest
interest rates in 30 years spurred companies to seek more loans.  Borrowing by households and businesses rose from a revised
5.3 percent in June, the Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  said on its
website today. The median estimate of 12 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 4.85 percent.  The Reserve Bank has kept its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 5.5 percent this year to help boost the recovery in
 Africa ’s biggest economy, even as price pressures increased.
While credit demand is picking up, companies are still holding
back on investment in plants and machinery, undermining the
growth outlook, Governor Gill Marcus said on Aug. 23.  “We expect corporate demand for credit to remain
relatively subdued as businesses stay hesitant to expand
operations too aggressively given lingering uncertainties over
the strength of the local and global recoveries,”  Carmen Altenkirch , an economist at Nedbank Group Ltd., said in a note
to clients today.  A report today may show the economy expanded an annualized
1.6 percent in the second quarter, down from 4.8 percent in the
previous three months, according to the median estimate of 18
analysts polled by Bloomberg.  The rand was at 7.0556 against the dollar as of 10:37 a.m.
in Johannesburg from 7.0338 before the data was released. The
yield on the R157 government bond, due 2015, was little changed
at 6.553 percent.  Marcus said last week the bank will act “appropriately”
if there’s a sustained slowdown in the global economy, fueling
speculation the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee may lower its
key rate again.  The broad M3 measure of  money supply  increased 5.6 percent
in July from the year earlier, down from a revised 6 percent in
June, the central bank said. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey was for M3 to expand 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
