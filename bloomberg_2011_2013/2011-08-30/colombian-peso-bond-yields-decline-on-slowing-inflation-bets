Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields lower for a second day, amid speculation declines in food
and gasoline prices will lead inflation to slow this month.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.36
percent at 3:16 p.m. New York time. The price rose 0.249 centavo
to 121.485 centavos per peso.  “Wholesale data is showing food inflation was negative”
in August, said Daniel Velandia, head analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Correval SA. “If that drop was translated into
consumer prices, and the data was also able to incorporate this
month’s cut in gas prices, inflation will come in lower than
what surveys are pointing to.”  Colombia’s consumer prices rose 0.13 percent in August from
the previous month, after rising 0.14 percent in July, according
to the median estimate of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The national statistics agency is slated to publish its monthly
inflation report Sept. 5.  The government announced last week it reduced the price of
gasoline by 100 pesos ($0.06) per gallon as part of a plan to
adjust tax rates on fuels based on international and domestic
prices.  The peso was little changed at 1,786.30 per dollar from
1,786.90 yesterday. The peso is up 7.1 percent in the past six
months, the best performance among 25 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
