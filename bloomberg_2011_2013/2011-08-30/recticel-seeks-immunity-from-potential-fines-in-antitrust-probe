Recticel SA (REC) , the Belgian maker of
foam, car-interior trim and Lattoflex mattresses, said it
applied for immunity from potential antitrust fines as part of a
European Union probe into producers of polyurethane foam.  Recticel’s cooperation with the European Commission, the EU
antitrust regulator in Brussels, “is done in the frame of the
leniency program,” which may reduce or exempt companies from
fines, the company said today in its first-half earnings report.
Recticel didn’t say whether EU regulators had agreed to exempt
it from fines in return for cooperation.  Recticel said last August that EU antitrust officials
searched its premises in  Belgium , the U.K. and Austria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
