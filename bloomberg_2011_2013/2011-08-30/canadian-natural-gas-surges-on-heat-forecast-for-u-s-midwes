Canadian natural gas rose on
forecasts for hotter-than-normal weather in the U.S., boosting
demand for the nation’s gas exports.  Cooling demand in the Midwest will average 51 percent
higher than normal through Sept. 6, according to Weather
Derivates of Belton,  Missouri . Chicago will reach a high of 92
degrees Fahrenheit (33 Celsius) Sept. 5, 12 degrees above
normal,  State College , Pennsylvania-based AccuWeather Inc. said.  “In the East they’re still recovering from the hurricane
on the nuclear power generation side,” said Eric Bickel, an
energy analyst at Summit Energy Services in Louisville,
 Kentucky . “With the heat coming after the hurricane they may
need more gas generation.”  Alberta gas for September jumped 12 cents, or 3.5 percent,
to C$3.5175 per gigajoule ($3.41 per million British thermal
units) as of 1:40 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX,  a
Canadian Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped
to users in  Canada  and the U.S., and is priced on TransCanada
Corp.’s  Alberta  system.  October gas on NGX rose 13.25 cents to C$3.505 per
gigagoule. Gas for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 7.9 cents to settle at $3.909 per million Btu.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.7 billion cubic
feet, 84 million below target.  Flow Rates  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.71 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.89 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.3 billion cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.45 billion cubic feet today, about 52 percent of its
capacity of 2.76 billion.  The volume on Spectra Energy’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.88
billion cubic feet at 12:20 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
