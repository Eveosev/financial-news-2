Oil erased today’s gain as
speculation that U.S. stockpiles will increase countered signs
of growth in the world’s biggest crude consumer.  The October future fell 8 cents to $87.19 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after
earlier rising as much as 45 cents. The contract yesterday
climbed 2.2 percent to $87.27, the highest close since Aug. 17.
Prices are up 17 percent the past year.  Brent oil for October settlement gained 29 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $112.17 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract was at a
premium of $24.95 to U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures,
compared with a record close of $26.21 on Aug. 19.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
