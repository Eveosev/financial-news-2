Ethanol futures were little changed
in  Chicago  as gasoline gained and on speculation exports will
decline after  Brazil  said it will reduce the amount of the
biofuel in its gasoline.  Futures were steady after Brazil’s energy minister, Edison
Lobao, said the country will cut the ethanol mix in gasoline to
20 percent from 25 percent. Separately, gasoline futures in the
U.S. gained amid concern Tropical Storm Katia will disrupt
refinery operations.  “Brazil went from 25 percent to 20 percent, so that
definitely caused a bit of selling,” said Justin Dirico, a
trader at SCB & Associates in Chicago. “If it wasn’t for that
ethanol would probably be higher, especially with gasoline up.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 0.4 cent to
$2.922 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures are up 23
percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $3.025 a gallon and in Chicago the additive gained 3
cents, or 1 percent, to $2.955, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  added 1.75 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$3.07 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel rose 0.5 cent
to $3.085.  U.S.  exports  of ethanol in June fell 5.4 percent to 53,000
barrels a day, the Energy Department said in a report today.  Exports to Brazil sank 61 percent to 7,000 barrels a day
from 18,000 barrels in May. Exports to the country averaged
52,000 a day in April, according to Energy Department data.  “This downgrade isn’t going to be healthy at all,” Dirico
said.  The profit from turning a bushel of corn into 2.75 gallons
of ethanol, or the so-called crush margin, was 15 cents today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
