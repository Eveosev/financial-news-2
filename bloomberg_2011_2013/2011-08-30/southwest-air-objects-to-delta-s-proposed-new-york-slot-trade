Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  and other
carriers objected to  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) ’s efforts to expand at
New York’s LaGuardia airport through a proposed swap of takeoff
and landing slots with  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)   The accord between Delta and  US Airways  calls for divesting
48 slots to smaller rivals, about 30 percent fewer than a
previous plan that those two carriers walked away from last
year. Dallas-based Southwest said in a filing that there is “no
justification for such smaller divestitures.”  The Department of Transportation should “seriously
consider even larger carve-outs in light of the severe -- and
permanent -- negative impact that the proposed transaction will
have on competition,” Southwest said in a regulatory filing
posted today on the agency website.  JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU)  and Virgin America Inc. also filed
objections. The Airports Council International trade group based
in  Washington  urged regulators to deny the proposal from
Atlanta-based Delta and Tempe, Arizona-based US Airways, saying
it would strip local airport authorities of control of their
facilities.  Last month U.S. regulators tentatively approved the deal,
which would give Delta 132 more slot pairs at LaGuardia and
control of about half the flights there. In exchange, US Airways
would get 42 pairs at Washington Reagan National Airport.  LaGuardia  and National are so congested that they are
under flight restrictions, meaning carriers must trade slots in
order to grow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
