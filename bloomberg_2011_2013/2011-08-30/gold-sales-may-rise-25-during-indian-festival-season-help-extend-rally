Gold demand in India, the biggest
user, may surge 25 percent during the festival season this year
as buyers expect prices to extend a record rally on haven
demand, according to  Rajesh Exports Ltd. (RJEX)   Purchases of gold jewelry, coins, bars and medallions may
climb to 250 metric tons in the three months ending Nov. 30,
compared with an estimated 200 tons in the same period a year
earlier, said Rajesh Mehta, chairman of Rajesh Exports, India’s
biggest jewelry maker.  Rising Indian demand may help extend a 26 percent rally in
prices this year that’s made the precious metal the second-best
performer on the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw
materials. Imports may reach a record 1,000 tons this year as
investors seek a haven against inflation and volatility in stock
markets, Prithviraj Kothari, president of the Bombay Bullion
Association, said Aug. 20.  “In spite of the high prices, we have seen quite good
demand,” Mehta said in a phone interview yesterday. “When
people are buying jewelry, their motive is investment.”  Buying gold is considered auspicious during the religious
festivals in  India . The festival season this year starts with
Eid this month and ends in October with Diwali, which is
followed by the traditional wedding season.  Gold for immediate delivery climbed $6.05 or 0.3 percent,
to $1,794.48 an ounce at 11:10 a.m. in Mumbai. It rose to a
record $1,913.50 on Aug. 23. Bullion is heading for its 11th
annual gain as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis and concern that
the  U.S. economy  may be slowing spur demand for a haven.  Record Demand  The October-delivery contract on the Multi Commodity
Exchange of India Ltd. gained as much as 0.4 percent to 26,845
rupees ($583) per 10 grams today and traded at 26,796 rupees at
11:09 a.m. in Mumbai.  Indian consumption rose to a record 963.1 tons last year,
driving imports to the highest level ever at 958 tons, according
to the World Gold Council. Purchases surged 60 percent to 267
tons in the three months ended June 30, from a year earlier, the
producer-funded council said on Aug. 18. Investment demand
jumped 78 percent to 108.5 tons, the second-highest quarter on
record, it said.  “Demand will go up because of the festival season and also
people feel that prices may go higher,” Mehta said.  UBS AG’s physical gold sales to India on Aug. 22 were the
most since May 10 and more than double the daily average volumes
this year, the bank said in a report on Aug. 23.  ‘Excellent Monsoon’  “The monsoon season so far has been good, and strong gold
demand is expected for the upcoming festival season,” UBS
analyst Edel Tully said in the report.  The rain-dependent  agriculture sector  makes up about 15
percent of the Indian economy and a bumper harvest boosts rural
incomes, lifting sales from cars to televisions and gold. The
nation’s 235 million farmers rely on the annual June-to-
September monsoon to plant crops from wheat to rice. Rains were
“normal” between June 1 and Aug. 28, according to the
country’s weather forecaster.  “A lot of people are waiting for stability in prices
before buying,” said Kunal Shah, head of commodity research at
Nirmal Bang Commodities Pvt. “We have seen an excellent monsoon
and I don’t see any reason for a drop in demand.”  Gold may reach $2,000 by the end of the year, according to
the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 13 traders and
analysts at a conference in Kovalam in South India on Aug. 20.  “Scrap sales surprisingly are not much even at these
prices as investors hope prices will rise to much higher
levels,” said Mehta.  To contact the reporters on this story:
