Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
climbed to the highest level in almost four weeks after a
federal court denied a motion by Mylan Inc. to dismiss Teva’s
patent lawsuit on the multiple-sclerosis drug Copaxone.  The shares of the world’s largest maker of generic drugs
rose 0.9 percent to 143.80 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel
Aviv, the highest since Aug. 4.  U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones dismissed Mylan’s claim
that Teva’s patent for the drug was invalid. A trial on the
patent infringement case in  Manhattan  is set to begin Sept. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
