Oil options volatility decreased as
the underlying futures increased for a fourth day, climbing with
gasoline and heating oil as East Coast refineries worked to
restart after Hurricane Irene.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
October, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 39.5 percent at 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 41.2 percent yesterday.  Oil for October delivery increased $1.63, or 1.9 percent,
to settle at $88.90 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile

percent this year.  The most active contract in electronic trading today was
October $80 puts, with 2,157 lots changing hands. The options
fell 34 cents to 77 cents a barrel at 4:48 p.m. in New York.
October $95 calls, the next-most active option, gained 15 cents
to 64 cents with 1,489 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000
barrels of crude.  Puts outnumbered calls by 65 percent to 35 percent in
electronic trading on the Nymex.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occur the next business day.  October $100 calls were the most active options traded in
the previous session, with 5,563 lots changing hands. They edged
