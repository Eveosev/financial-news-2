PG&E Corp. (PCG)  exploited lax regulatory
oversight and used flawed materials in a natural-gas pipeline,
leading to a 2010 California blast that killed eight people and
destroyed 38 homes, a U.S. safety board concluded.  PG&E’s inadequate quality controls in 1956, when the line
in San Bruno was built, allowed construction of a substandard,
poorly welded pipeline, and coupled with deficient company
management led to the explosion last year, the  National
Transportation Safety Board  said.  The panel, which analyzes accidents in pipelines carrying
hazardous materials, adopted the final report and
recommendations at a meeting today in Washington.  “We know that this tragedy began years ago with PG&E’s
1956 installation of a woefully inadequate pipe, ” Deborah Hersman, the board chairman, said during the meeting. PG&E is
“a company that exploited weaknesses in a lax system of
oversight.”  PG&E, which on Aug. 15 said a defective weld probably
caused the pipeline rupture, is planning to spend $2.2 billion
to replace 186 miles (299 kilometers) of pipeline and conduct
strength tests on 783 miles of pipe. The company will inspect
234 miles and retrofit 199 miles of pipe to accommodate
inspections, according to an Aug. 26 regulatory filing.  “We have already taken aggressive action,” Brian Swanson,
a PG&E spokesman, said today in  Washington . “We appreciate all
the hard work the NTSB has done on this investigation and we
will adopt and implement their recommendations into our
emergency response.”  Recommendations Released  The board today recommended testing all gas transmission
lines constructed before 1970 and previously excluded from
safety-inspection requirements introduced at the time. NTSB also
told PG&E to expedite automatic shutoff-valve installation and
revise work and emergency response procedures.  The company didn’t have a response coordination center to
gather, assess and act on information about the accident, NTSB
investigators told the board today. PG&E also lacked equipment
to isolate a short section of line and quickly stop the flow of
natural gas, Bob Trainor, a member of the investigative team,
told the board. Gas that escaped from the pipe was sufficient to
heat 1,200 houses for a year, Hersman said.  The 95 minutes that PG&E needed to stop the flow of gas
“was excessive,” the board decided, and could have been
reduced, had the automatic shut-off valves or remote-controlled
valves been installed, according to its report.  Drugs, Sewer Line  While drug use wasn’t a reason for the accident, the
company failed to conduct appropriate alcohol and drug tests
after the incident, the board concluded.  The installation in 2008 of a sewer line by San Bruno
didn’t contribute to the rupture, according to the board.  PG&E failed to supply the board with information about the
origin of parts used in the pipe and didn’t inform investigators
about a leak more than two decades earlier on the same pipeline
until 10 months into the probe, Hersman said today.  “For government to do its job -- safeguard the public --
it cannot trust alone, it must verify,” Hersman said today,
quoting President  Ronald Reagan . “And where the trust is not
merited, make sure the penalty is high. Because, when there’s an
accident like the one in San Bruno, it is too late.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
