Brazil ’s GWI Asset Management SA
reopened nine funds for redemptions and new investments after
approval by investors, Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the
administrator of investments, said in regulatory filings
yesterday.  One of the funds, Fundo de Investimento em Acoes GWI
Private no Exterior, is still facing liquidity problems, BNY
Mellon said in one of the statements.  “The liquidity problems that caused the fund’s closing for
redemptions still persists,” BNY Mellon said in one of the
filings. All nine funds can be closed again if redemptions
aren’t consistent with the assets, according to BNY Mellon.  Marfrig Alimentos SA,  Latin America ’s second-largest beef
producer, rose 1 percent on the Bovespa at 10:32 a.m. New York
time after gaining 4.3 percent yesterday. It had plunged 45
percent between July 29 and Aug. 11 as GWI reduced its stake to
cover its funds’ losses, Marfrig Chief Executive Officer Marcos Molina said in an interview on Aug. 15. The Bovespa index slid
9.3 percent in the same period.  GWI, a Sao Paulo-based firm that had $245 million under
management as of July, shut its funds for redemptions and new
investments after a global market sell-off crushed its leveraged
equity bets, BNY Mellon said on Aug. 12. This was after the
Bovespa index plunged 20 percent from its bull-market peak in
November, entering a bear market on July 27.  The investment firm was founded in 1995 as a financial-
services company for Brazil’s Korean immigrant community,
according to its  website . In 1998, it shifted focus to investing
in Brazilian equities. The firm’s GWI Leverage Fundo de
Investimento em Acoes fund beat at least 98 percent of peers in
2006, 2007 and 2009, during which year it soared 244 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
