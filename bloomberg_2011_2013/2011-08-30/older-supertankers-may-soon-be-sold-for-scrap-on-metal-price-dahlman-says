Supertankers aged 15 years or older
may soon be demolished because their value as scrap has risen
relative to what they would fetch for continued trading, New
York-based investment bank Dahlman Rose & Co. said.  Very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, are worth about $19
million as scrap while carriers built before 1996 would fetch
$20 million to $25 million when sold for continued trading,
shipping analyst  Omar Nokta  said in an e-mailed report today.
Thatâ€™s the highest percentage since the early 1980s and may
incentivize demolitions, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
