New Jersey  Governor Chris Christie
said he asked President Barack Obama for an expedited
declaration of a major disaster for the whole state.   Hurricane Irene required emergency shelters to be
established in 16 counties to house almost 16,000 evacuees,
while more than 700,000 residences had power failures, Christie
said in an e-mailed statement. The disaster declaration would
let residents and local governments received federal aid as
quickly as possible, Christie said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
