The number of gasoline shipments to
the U.S. from  Europe  fell 33 percent since 2005 as cargoes were
displaced by supplies from India, according to McQuilling
Partners Inc., a New York-based shipping consultant.  Oil companies  booked 90 vessels for deliveries to the U.S.
Atlantic Coast and the Gulf of Mexico since the start of May,
compared with 135 in the same period of 2005, McQuilling said in
an e-mailed report Aug. 25, citing its own data on shipping
deals. European loads are being displaced by larger cargoes from
India and U.S. refinery production has increased, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
