U.S. stock futures fell before
economic reports that may show a decline in residential real-
estate prices and a weakening in  consumer confidence .  Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the largest U.S. home improvement
retailer, and  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s biggest restaurant
chain, declined in German trading.  Universal Display Corp. (PANL) 
surged more than 9 percent after agreeing a license deal with
Panasonic Idemitsu OLED Lighting Co.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in September
slipped 0.4 percent to 1,203 at 7:15 a.m. in  New York . Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures expiring the same month lost 33
points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,484.  Stocks rose yesterday, sending the  S&P 500  to its highest
level in almost a month, amid optimism the economy will recover
and after  Hurricane Irene  failed to shut financial markets.  The S&P 500 fell 18 percent from its three-year high on
April 29 to its low on Aug. 8 amid concern that the global
economy will slow. Gauges of financial, industrial and energy
shares, which are the most tied to the economy, led declines in
the index, slumping at least 22 percent over that period.  “We’re still waiting for data that may affirm what
investors have been thinking more and more: that there may be a
double dip,” said Jacques Porta, a  fund manager  at Ofi
Patrimoine in Paris, who helps oversee about $400 million in
stocks. “The economic statistics will be important. If the
numbers only show a soft patch, then we have to come back to the
market. The clouds are still dark, but we have to be reactive
and catch the train before it’s too late.”  House Prices, Confidence  Residential real-estate prices probably dropped in the year
ended June by the most in 19 months, indicating the housing
market continues to hamper the U.S. recovery, economists said
before a report today.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of home values in 20 cities fell
4.6 percent from June 2010, the biggest 12-month decrease since
November 2009, according to the median forecast of 31 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Another report may show that
consumer confidence sank in August to its lowest level in 10
months.  The  Federal Reserve  will release the minutes from its most
recent policy meeting at 2 p.m. New York time today. Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said on Aug. 26 in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , that
the economy isn’t deteriorating enough to warrant any immediate
stimulus and the central bank still has tools to stimulate
growth.  Home Depot lost 1.3 percent to $33.56 in  Germany .
McDonald’s retreated 1.1 percent to $89.79.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  slipped 0.6 percent to $8.34 in early
New York trading. JPMorgan Chase & Co. slid 0.8 percent to
$37.34.  Universal Display jumped 9.2 percent to $55.92 in German
trading after saying that Panasonic Idemitsu OLED Lighting will
use the company’s materials and technology in lighting products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
