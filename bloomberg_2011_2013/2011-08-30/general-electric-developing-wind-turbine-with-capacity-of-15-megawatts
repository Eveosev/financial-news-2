General Electric Co. (GE) , the worldâ€™s
biggest maker of electricity-generation equipment, plans to
develop a wind turbine that generates as much as six times more
power than its largest land-based model.  GE Global Research plans to spend $3 million from the U.S.
Energy Department to design a direct-drive wind turbine that
will generate as much as 15 megawatts using superconducting
magnets and lightweight materials, Fairfield, Connecticut-based
GE said today in a statement.  GE will decide how to build and commercialize the turbines
in a second phase of the two-year project.  The company currently offers 1.5-megawatt and 2.5-megawatt
 wind turbines  for onshore wind farms and a 4-megawatt model for
offshore projects, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
