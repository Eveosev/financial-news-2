Optimism at Latvian companies about
the state of the economy returned in the second quarter after
two consecutive periods of pessimism, according to a business
confidence  survey  released by Citadele Bank AS.  The Citadele Index, which surveys directors of 750 local
companies, rose to 50.77 from 48.36 in the first three months,
the bank said today. Ratings below 50 indicate pessimism in the
survey compiled along with the polling company SKDS. The rating
was 47.62 in the fourth quarter and 51.21 in the third quarter
of 2010.  Latvia’s economy is rebounding from the European Union’s
deepest recession as exports and manufacturing recover. Gross
domestic product expanded a preliminary 5.3 percent in the
second quarter, the quickest pace in 3 1/2 years.  The Baltic country turned to a group led by the European
Union and the  International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5 billion-euro
($10.8 billion) bailout after a real estate-fueled boom turned
bust in 2008, credit markets froze and the state took over Parex
Banka.  Citadele’s  future index , gauging business expectations over
the next six months, rose 0.81 points to 53.35 points in the
second quarter, the highest level since the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
