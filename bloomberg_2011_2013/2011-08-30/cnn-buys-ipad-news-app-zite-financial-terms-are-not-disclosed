Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s  CNN  cable news
channel acquired Zite, an application for  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad that
offers users a personalized news stream.  Zite, available free from Apple’s iTunes and App Store,
will remain a stand-alone business, Jim Walton, president of CNN
Worldwide, said today in a statement. Financial terms weren’t
disclosed.  CNN is buying Zite as more viewers get their news on tablet
computers and smartphones. The network began providing cable
subscribers a live stream of its 24-hour news channel online and
through an app for Apple’s iPad and iPhone, New York-based Time
Warner said last month.  Time Warner rose 28 cents to $31.30 at 3:04 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock had slipped 3.6
percent this year before today.  Zite, now based in Vancouver and relocating to  San
Francisco , finds content from sources on the Web that fit the
interests of a particular user’s profile, CNN said in its
statement. The app adapts to its users’ preferences, providing
more specific results over time, the company said.  Mark Johnson , Zite’s chief executive officer, will continue
to run the app’s day-to-day operations and will report to KC Estenson, general manager of CNN Digital. Zite founder Ali Davar
will remain with the company as executive director.  The deal was reported last week as likely by the Canadian
site  Techvibes.com , which said CNN was paying $20 million to $25
million for Zite.  To contact the reporter on this story:
