Mexico’s peso declined on
speculation the central bank will cut  interest rates  to bolster
economic growth as the economy in the U.S., the nation’s largest
trading partner, slows.  The peso dropped 0.6 percent to 12.5322 per  U.S. dollar  at
5 p.m.  New York  time, from 12.4622 yesterday. The currency has
weakened 1.5 percent this year against the dollar, the second-
worst performer among the major Latin American currencies
tracked by Bloomberg after  Argentina ’s peso.  “We continue to see a weakened global growth outlook and
this has led to a recalibration in Mexico’s rate outlook,” said
Aryam Vazquez, an emerging markets economist at  Wells Fargo &
Co . in New York. “The policy meeting last week was very dovish
and has heightened expectations of a rate cut.”  Policy makers said on Aug. 26 they would “consider the
convenience of adjusting” monetary policy if  Mexico ’s growth
outlook worsened. The U.S. purchases about 80 percent of
Mexico’s exports.  The Conference Board’s index, a gauge of U.S. consumer
confidence, fell to 44.5, the lowest since April 2009, the New
York-based research group said today. In a separate report,  home
prices  fell for a ninth month.  The yield on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 rose 3 basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.31 percent, according to
Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell 0.35 centavo
to 133.09 centavos per peso.  Mexico sold all 5.5 billion pesos of 28-day Cetes it
offered at auction today, the central bank said in an e-mailed
statement. The government sold all of the 6.5 billion pesos of
91-day bills it offered and all of the 7 billion pesos of 175-
day Cetes it offered, the bank said.  Traders didn’t trigger any of the dollar options available
today, the central bank said on its website. The bank has been
buying as much as $600 million through the options every month
since March 2010 to bolster foreign reserves. They allow the
central bank to accumulate dollars, insuring against outflows of
capital and limiting the peso’s appreciation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
