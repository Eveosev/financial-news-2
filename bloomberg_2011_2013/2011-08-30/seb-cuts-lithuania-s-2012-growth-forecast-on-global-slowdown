Lithuania’s economy may expand at a
slower than previously estimated pace next year as an economic
slowdown in key export markets may reduce demand for its
products, SEB Bank AB said.  SEB, Lithuania’s largest lender, cut its 2012 economic
growth forecast for the country to 4 percent from a 5.5 percent
estimate released in June, according to an e-mailed statement
today.  Lithuania’s export-led growth, the second-fastest in the
European Union after Estonia in the second quarter, is in peril
as a deepening debt crisis in the euro area and a cut in the
U.S. credit-rating intensifies threats to the global economy.
The Baltic nation’s economy, where exports account for about
two-thirds of output, grew 6.3 percent in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
