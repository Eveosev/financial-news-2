U.S. Gulf crude premiums
strengthened after the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate’s
discount to Brent widened.  The gap between WTI and Brent October contracts widened 51
cents to $25.12 a barrel. The spread settled Aug. 19 at a record
margin of $26.21.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet added 25 cents to $28.25 a barrel
over WTI at 2:03 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased 50 cents to
$25.50.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added 35 cents to $23.60 while Poseidon strengthened 65
cents to $23.50 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium was unchanged at $22 a
barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 10 cents to 65
cents. Thunder Horse’s premium weakened 25 cents to $25.25 above
the benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude narrowed 75 cents to $14 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 50 cents to
$11.25 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
