Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  said dividends on its $5 billion in preferred shares of
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  will be taxed at a 14.175 percent rate
because the securities will be held in insurance units.  “Virtually all of the stocks that Berkshire owns are held
in its property-casualty subsidiaries, and that will be the case
with the Bank of America preferred,” Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-
based firm said today in a statement.  Berkshire issued the statement in response to a Wall Street
Journal editorial that said the effective  tax rate  would be 10.5
percent. Ashley Huston, a spokeswoman for the Wall Street
Journal, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
