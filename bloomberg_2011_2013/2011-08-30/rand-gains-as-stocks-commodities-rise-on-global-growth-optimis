The rand fell against the dollar for
the first time in four days as economic growth slowed more than
economists’ expectations in the second quarter, fuelling bets
the central bank may cut rates. Bonds gained.  The rand retreated as much as 0.6 percent to 7.0967 per
dollar and traded 0.4 percent down at 7.0795 as of 3:24 p.m. in
Johannesburg, erasing an earlier gain of 0.4 percent.  South Africa ’s economy expanded an annualized 1.3 percent
in the second quarter, its slowest pace in almost two years,
from a revised 4.5 percent in the first quarter, Statistics
South Africa said. The median estimate of 18 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg was for an expansion of 1.6 percent.  “The softer GDP growth print does not bode well for growth
prospects going forward, which is rand-negative from a GDP
differential perspective,” Shireen Darmalingam, an analyst at
Standard Bank Group Ltd. in Johannesburg, wrote in an e-mailed
note. “The data poses upside risks to portfolio outflows,
particularly out of the South African equity market, as
investors search for better economic growth prospects
elsewhere.”  Foreign investors have sold a net 9.47 billion rand ($1.3
billion) of South African equities this year, compared with 20.5
billion rand of net purchases in the corresponding period last
year, according to data from JSE Ltd., which manages the
country’s stock exchange.  Bonds Rise  European governments have pared spending this year to ease
the region’s debt crisis, limiting exports to a region that buys
about a third of South African manufactured goods. That’s
weakening the recovery in  Africa ’s biggest economy, adding to
expectations the central bank may keep its benchmark  interest
rate  at a 30-year low of 5.5 percent this year or possibly
reduce it, narrowing the rand’s yield advantage.  Bonds gained for a third day. The 13.5 percent notes
maturing in 2015 rose 13 cents to 124.32 rand, driving the yield
down four basis points to 6.527 percent. The 6.75 percent
securities due 2021 climbed 22 cents to 93.45 rand, cutting the
yield three basis points to 7.73 percent.  Forward-rate agreements starting in January, which
investors use to lock in borrowing costs, dropped three basis
points today to 5.31 percent, the lowest in at least 10 years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts are
pricing in a 50 percent chance of an interest rate cut this
year, Darmalingam wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
