A court deferred until Sept. 20 an
environmental agency’s order to close 22 of  Coal India Ltd. (COAL) ’s
mines in the eastern state of Jharkhand, three people with
direct knowledge of the matter said.  The Jharkhand High Court in Ranchi asked  Coal India , the
world’s biggest producer of the fuel, to file a rejoinder to
arguments filed by the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board,
said the people, who aren’t authorized to speak to the media.
Coal  India  chairman N.C. Jha couldn’t be reached immediately for
comment.  The closure, which was imposed for violating environment
regulations, would endanger daily coal production of about
40,000 metric tons, Jha said on Aug. 25, a day after the miner
filed a lawsuit against the order. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd., a
unit of state-owned Coal India that operates the mines, produces
about 76,000 tons a day.  Coal India plans to boost production by 4.8 percent to 452
million tons this fiscal year, according to an agreement signed
with the government.  Coal India gained 1.7 percent to 375.60 rupees at the 3:30
p.m. close in Mumbai, the highest level since Aug. 23. The stock
has climbed 19 percent this year, compared with a 19 percent
drop in the benchmark Sensitive Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
