Inmarsat Plc (ISAT) , the biggest provider
of satellite services to the maritime industry, agreed in
principle to select  Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL)  as technology partner
to develop aeronautical services.  With the support of Rockwell Collins, in-flight testing of
new aeronautical services will begin after the launch of the
first Inmarsat-5 satellite scheduled for mid-2013 with global
services for commercial air transport, business aviation and
government customers worldwide in 2014, Inmarsat said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Under the agreement signed today, Inmarsat and Rockwell
Collins will enter into exclusive negotiations that are expected
to lead to definitive agreements by late 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
