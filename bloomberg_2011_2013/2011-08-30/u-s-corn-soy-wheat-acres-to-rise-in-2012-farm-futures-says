U.S. farmers will plant more corn,
soybeans and wheat for crops harvested in 2012 because of rising
prices, Farm  Futures  magazine said, citing a survey of almost
1,000 growers.  The area planted with corn may rise 1.7 percent to 93.87
million acres, and soybean acreage may increase 2.3 percent to
76.9 million, Farm Futures said today in a  news release . Farmers
may increase winter- and spring-wheat plantings by 3.9 percent
to 58.63 million acres, the magazine said.  Farm Progress Cos., based in St. Charles,  Illinois ,
publishes Farm Futures nine times a year. Growers were surveyed
from late July to early August by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
