Boeing Co. (BA)  is counting on the 737
MAX, the new version of the world’s most widely flown jetliner,
to help capture half of a $2 trillion market in the next 20
years and fend off a challenge from Airbus SAS.  Powered by more efficient engines, the 737 MAX has already
won 496 order commitments in “a very positive indicator of
demand for what has been viewed as a ‘me-too’ offering,” Robert Spingarn, a New York-based Credit Suisse analyst, said yesterday
in a note to clients.  Deliveries of the 737 MAX should begin in 2017, two years
after Airbus’s upgraded A320neo, Boeing said yesterday after its
board gave formal approval to the jet. The commitments are
spread among five different customers, the company said.  The directors’ go-ahead followed an agreement in July to
sell 100 of the jets to  American Airlines  as half of an order
with the Chicago-based planemaker. American split a purchase of
460 aircraft between Boeing and Airbus, which began offering
more fuel-efficient engines on its A320 narrow-body in December.  The Airbus order broke an exclusive arrangement between
 Fort Worth , Texas-based American and Boeing dating to 1987,
compelling the planemaker to shift to the quicker, cheaper
option of upgrading the 737 from its stated preference of
developing an all-new jet.  Boeing’s 20-year forecast projects global sales of 23,000
narrow-body jets in the next two decades, at a value of almost
$2 trillion. The company ranks second in commercial deliveries
to Toulouse, France-based Airbus, which has rung up more than
1,000 orders and commitments since unveiling the A320neo in
December.  Market Share  “This is an airplane that’s going to allow us not to just
maintain the market share we have, but one that will allow us to
grow the market share,” Boeing Commercial Airplanes President
 Jim Albaugh  said at a news conference in Renton,  Washington ,
near the factory where the 737s are built.  Boeing should be able to command a premium price for the
new version, said Albaugh, who declined to comment further. The
average 737 has a catalog price of $78 million. The MAX will use
modified Leap-1B engines from  CFM International  and offer 7
percent lower operating costs than rivals.  “In today’s operating environment, it is critical for us
to maximize the fuel- and cost-efficiency of our fleet,” said
Vasu Raja, managing director for corporate planning at AMR
Corp.’s American. “Boeing’s latest evolution of 737 product is
an important step forward for airlines and our customers.”  Fuel-Efficient  Fuel use on the 737 MAX will be 16 percent less than the
existing A320 and 4 percent less than the neo, said  Marc Birtel ,
a Boeing spokesman. The plane will also be slightly more
efficient than Bombardier Inc.’s new CSeries narrow-body jets,
said  Nicole Piasecki , Boeing’s business-development chief.  “Boeing made the right decision to re-engine,” said  John Leahy , Airbus’s chief operating officer, adding that the 737,
which was launched in 1965 and redesigned in the 1990s, isn’t as
modern as the A320 family.  Leahy had advocated against Boeing’s previous preference
for an all-new plane by 2020, saying it would skew the
competitive landscape since Airbus didn’t foresee having its own
new jet until the middle of the next decade.  Engine Fan Size  Engineers are studying whether to use a 66-inch or 68-inch
fan size for the new engines, up from 61 inches now, Albaugh
said. They have been told to make minimal changes to the rest of
the plane -- essentially only stiffening some sections to handle
the heavier engines -- and avoid the temptation to creep toward
the new-plane development that the company rejected, he said.  The new engines will be offered for the current models, the
737-700, -800 and -900, to be renamed the -7, -8 and -9.  A fleet of 100 737 MAX-8s would save an airline about $85
million in fuel a year compared with the 737-800, according to
the company.  Boeing climbed 83 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $66.86 at 11:37
a.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock’s
gain yesterday was the largest among the 30 companies in the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average .  Albaugh is “challenging the team” to get the 737 MAX to
the market as soon as possible, while being mindful of the
delays that have plagued the two current development programs,
Piasecki said. The 787 Dreamliner is running more than three
years late and the 747-8 is two years behind schedule.  ‘Prudent’ Plan  “Given our recent track record, we are being very prudent
and disciplined to make sure that whatever we talk to our
customers about, we actually have a plan to deliver on,”
Piasecki said after the press conference. “I think you’ll see
improvements on the 2017” delivery target.  With airlines reluctant to switch between planemakers, most
737 customers “will be taking a serious look” at the new jet,
Robert Stallard, an RBC Capital analyst in New York, wrote in a
report yesterday. Like Credit Suisse’s Springarn, he rates the
shares as “outperform.”  Albaugh said that while Boeing will work with carriers if
they want to convert existing orders to MAX contracts, most
customers probably will stick with the current 737. Boeing’s
existing jets will still cost less to operate than the A320neo
when including expenses such as maintenance, the company said.  Sales and production of the current 737 should run “well
into the end of this decade,” Albaugh said. Delta Air Lines
Inc. last week ordered 100 737-900ERs, boosting a backlog that
was already more than 2,100 planes.  The company has teams looking at where to build the 737
MAX, with Renton “at the top of our list,” though other brand-
new sites are being considered, Albaugh said. He expects to make
a decision in six to eight months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
