Organization SA (HTO)  plans to close 77 of its own-name shops and 61
customer service points as part of a reorganization of its
retail sales network,  Kathimerini  reported.  The company will offer 186 employees a voluntary redundancy
package, with compensation of from 17,000 euros ($24,626) to
103,000 euros, Alternatively, workers affected can leave the
company for two years at 50 percent of salary, the Athens-based
newspaper said, without citing anyone.  Employees who chose neither offer will be relocated to
positions on islands or other locations on the Greek mainland,
