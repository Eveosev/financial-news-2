New Zealand ’s dollar touched the
highest level in almost a month versus its U.S. counterpart as
data showed building permits increased and before a report
forecast to show Chinese manufacturing strengthened.  The South Pacific currency, nicknamed the kiwi, gained
against all of its 16 most-traded peers tracked by Bloomberg
after New Zealand’s home-building permits in July jumped the
most since April 2008. The Australian dollar rose for a third
day against the U.S. currency.  The building report “adds further evidence that the New
Zealand economy is showing further resilience to the economic
downturn globally,” said  Mitul Kotecha , head of global currency
strategy in  Hong Kong  at Credit Agricole CIB.  New Zealand’s dollar gained 0.8 percent to 85.32 U.S. cents
at 11:30 a.m. in  New York  after earlier reaching 85.36, the
highest since Aug. 4. It advanced 0.7 percent to 65.45 yen, from
65.02, and rose to as high as 65.63, the strongest since Aug. 8.  Australia ’s dollar traded 0.2 percent stronger at $1.0679,
from $1.0656. It touched $1.0686, also the highest level since
Aug. 4. The Aussie was little changed at 81.92 yen, compared
with 81.88 yesterday.  New Zealand’s statistics bureau said home-building permits
increased 13 percent. Approvals are accelerating after dropping
to a two-year low in February, when the country’s deadliest
earthquake in eight decades struck the South Island city of
Christchurch.  Australian Permits  In Australia, the number of permits granted to build or
renovate houses and apartments rose 1 percent from June, the
Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney. While the increase trailed
the 2 percent rise forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, it was
the first advance in four months.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities touched its
highest level since Aug. 3, rallying was much as 1.5 percent.  China ’s manufacturing growth quickened to a reading of 51
in August from 50.7 the previous month, the Purchasing Managers’
Index due Sept. 1 is predicted to say, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. China is Australia’s largest
trading partner and New Zealand’s second-biggest export market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
