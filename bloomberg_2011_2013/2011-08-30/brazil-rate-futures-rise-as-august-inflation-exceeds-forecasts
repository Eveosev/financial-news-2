Yields on most Brazilian interest-
rate futures contracts rose after consumer prices increased more
than analysts estimatated, casting doubt on whether the central
bank will cut borrowing costs in 2011.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2013 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 11.13 percent at 8:50
a.m. in  New York .  Traders pared bets on an interest-rate cut after a report
showed inflation in Brazil as measured by the IGP-M  price index 
was faster than forecast in August. Prices rose 0.44 percent
this month compared after a 0.12 percent decline in July, the
Getulio Vargas Foundation said today. The median estimate among
31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a 0.41 percent gain.  “The central bank may want to lower  interest rates , but
there still aren’t numbers to justify this,” said David Rocha,
a fixed-income trader at Renasenca DTVM Ltda. The latest data
“helps bring the market back to reality,” he said.  The real weakened 0.2 percent to 1.5941 per dollar, from
1.5914 yesterday.  -- Editors: Brendan Walsh, Richard Richtmyer  To contact the reporters on this story:
