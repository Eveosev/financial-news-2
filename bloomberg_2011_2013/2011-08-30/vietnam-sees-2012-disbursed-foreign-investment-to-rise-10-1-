Vietnam  expects disbursements of
foreign direct investment to rise by as much as 10 percent in
2012 after forecasting it will be flat at $11 billion this year,
Dang Huy Dong, Vice Minister of Planning and Investment said in
an interview in Hanoi today.  The actual amount forecast to be disbursed compares to
pledged foreign investment that may total $15 billion to $16
billion this year, Dong said, without giving a figure for next
year. Vietnam attracted $18.6 billion of committed foreign
investment in 2010, according to figures on the ministry’s
website.  The government is struggling to tame inflation, which
quickened at 23.02 percent in August, the fastest in 33 months
and the fastest pace in  Asia . The central bank ordered lenders
yesterday to set aside more dollars as reserves for the third
time this year, aiming to limit lending growth and steady the
dong.  “There are forceful policies and we started to see
positive results,” Dong said. “We believe that somewhere early
next year or mid next year, things will come back to normal as
before.”  The value of expansion in existing foreign investment
projects reached $1.6 billion so far this year, according to
Dong. The figure “showed that their businesses are good here.
If their businesses in Vietnam are not good, if they don’t see
it’s good in the future, then why should they expand their
investment,” Dong said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
