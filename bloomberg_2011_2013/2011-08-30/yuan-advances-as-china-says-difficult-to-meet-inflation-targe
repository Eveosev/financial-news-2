The yuan rose to a 17-year high
after policy makers said it’s difficult to keep inflation within
target, fueling speculation the central bank will allow currency
gains to curb price increases.  The People’s Bank of  China  set the reference rate 0.05
percent stronger at 6.3849 per dollar today, the highest level
since July 2005. China’s overall price level may remain high,
the National Development and Reform Commission said in a
statement posted on its website yesterday. Global liquidity and
imported inflation will make it more difficult for the
government to meet its aim of containing consumer-price gains
within 4 percent this year, according to the statement.  “China may not want to deploy interest-rate hikes to deal
with inflation for now on economic-growth risks,” said Tommy Ong, senior vice-president of treasury and markets at DBS Bank
(Hong Kong) Ltd. “The government will let the currency
appreciate gradually to ease imported costs.”  The yuan traded at 6.3803 per dollar as of 10:08 a.m. in
 Shanghai , from 6.3810 yesterday, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The currency touched 6.3801 earlier, the
strongest level since the country unified the official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993. In Hong Kong’s
offshore market, the currency rose 0.05 percent to 6.3635.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.05 percent
to 6.2810 in Hong Kong, a 1.6 percent premium to the onshore
spot rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Central bank adviser Xia Bin said there’s scope for gradual
adjustment to the yuan’s exchange-rate mechanism, according to
an interview published in the Chinese Business News today.
Investors should be aware of this risk, Xia said in the report.  Consumer prices climbed 6.5 percent from a year earlier in
July, the most in three years. The central bank broadened the
base of reserves it requires commercial lenders to deposit with
it to help limit credit, economists said late last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
