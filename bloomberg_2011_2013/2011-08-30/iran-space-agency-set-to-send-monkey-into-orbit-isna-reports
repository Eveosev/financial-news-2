Iran  plans to send a monkey into
orbit as part of a plan to eventually send humans into space,
Iran’s ISNA news agency reported, citing Hamid Fazeli, head of
the country’s space agency.  A so-called life-capsule, carried by a Kavoshgar-5 carrier-
rocket, will lift off with a rhesus monkey, Fazeli said,
according to ISNA.  The government is portraying Iran’s technological and space
achievements as a symbol of independence from the western world
while the U.S. and its allies express concern that the projects
may have military applications.  The first Iranian-made satellite, called Omid, was launched
as part of the country’s space program in February 2009. In
February 2010, Iran fired a domestically produced rocket into
space with a satellite carrying two turtles, a rat and several
worms.  The U.S. and many of its allies are trying to limit Iran’s
development of nuclear technology, saying the atomic program may
be part of a secret plan to build weapons. Iran says its
satellite launches are for research and telecommunications
purposes, and that its nuclear work is purely civilian.  To contact the reporter on this story:
