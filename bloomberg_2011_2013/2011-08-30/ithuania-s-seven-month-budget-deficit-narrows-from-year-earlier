Lithuania’s central-government
budget deficit narrowed to 3.3 percent of estimated gross
domestic product through the first seven months this year.  The shortfall, calculated on a cash basis, was 5.1 percent
of GDP in the same period of 2010, the Vilnius-based  Finance
Ministry  said today in a statement on its website.  Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius’s government aims to narrow
the fiscal deficit, which includes funds from the central
government, local governments and social security, to 5.3
percent of GDP this year from 7.1 percent last year.  Government debt fell to 33.7 percent of GDP at the end of
July from 34 percent the previous month, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
