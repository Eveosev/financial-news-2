The  United Nations   Security Council 
today approved Britain’s request to release $1.55 billion of
seized Libyan assets held in U.K. banks.  “This represents another major step forward in getting
necessary assistance to the Libyan people, building on the
remarkable progress in recent days,” the British Foreign
Ministry said in a statement. “These banknotes, which were
frozen in the U.K. under UN sanctions, will help address urgent
humanitarian needs, instill confidence in the banking sector,
pay salaries of key public sector workers and free up liquidity
in the economy.”  The release to the  Central Bank  of Libya came after China
and Russia lifted their holds on the funds. All 15 members of
the  Security Council  must approve an exemption to UN sanctions
imposed on  Libya  before the money can be released.  The move came as Mustafa Abdel Jalil, chairman of the
rebel’s ruling National Transitional Council, gave forces loyal
to Muammar Qaddafi until Sept. 3 to surrender or face attack and
said members of the former leader’s government would receive
fair trials.  Separate bids for the release of about $1.5 billion in
Libyan assets submitted by France and  Germany  are being delayed
by Russian requests for more information on the funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
