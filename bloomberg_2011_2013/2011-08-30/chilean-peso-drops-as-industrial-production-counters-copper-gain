Chile’s peso fell for the first time
in eight days as industrial production expanded less than
forecast, overshadowing an increase in the price of copper, the
country’s main export.  The peso retreated 0.2 percent to 465.93 per dollar at 9:13
a.m.  New York  time, from 465.15 yesterday.  “Industrial production figures were bad, though the peso
is paring some losses on higher copper prices,” Ronald Volpi,
head of spot currency trading at Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa
SA, said in a phone interview. “Markets outside look mixed and
that doesn’t help either.”  Chile reported a 0.7 percent increase in industrial
production in July, the National Statistics Institute said. The
figure was lower than the 3.5 percent forecast by analysts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chilean copper
production fell 18 percent to 373,498 metric tons in July.  The price of copper, of which Chile is the world’s largest
producer, rose to a three-week high in New York on optimism for
U.S. economic growth, and speculation of a possible strike at
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.’s Grasberg mine in
 Indonesia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
