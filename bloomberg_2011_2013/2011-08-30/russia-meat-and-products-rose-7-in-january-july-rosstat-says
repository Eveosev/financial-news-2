Russia increased its meat and
related goods production by 7 percent in the first seven months
of the year compared with the same period in 2010, the  Federal
State Statistics Service  wrote in an e-mailed statement.  The service, known as Rosstat, did not provide seven-month
figures for the overall output in today’s statement.  In July, meat and byproduct output grew 4.5 percent to
96,900 metric tons compared with a year earlier. The figure is
1.2 percent lower than in June 2011, Rosstat said.  About 14,100 tons of meat from cattle was produced in July,
which is 15 percent less than a year earlier and 11.7 percent
less than in June 2011, Rosstat said. Pork production in July
rose 12.1 percent from 2010 to 66,100 tons, and was 1.5 percent
more than in the preceding month. Poultry and its byproducts’
output increased to 233,000 tons, up 8.9 percent compared with
July last year and 1.7 percent less than in June this year.  Russia  had 21.1 million cattle, including 9 million cows,
as of the end of July, which is 2 percent less than a year
earlier. The country had 18.8 million pigs and 25.3 million
sheep and goats, Rosstat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
