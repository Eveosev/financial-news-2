Volkswagen AG,  Europe ’s biggest
carmaker, is in talks with Windreich AG to invest in one of its
wind farms in the  North Sea , the German renewable energy
developer said.  “Talks with Volkswagen are ongoing,” Willi Balz,
Windreich’s chief executive officer, said in a phone interview
today without identifying the project. German authorities have
granted permission for three Windreich projects, including the
42-turbine Deutsche Bucht farm, which has a potential capacity
of as much as 252 megawatts if 6-megawatt turbines are used.  Areva Wind, a German unit of the French nuclear reactor
maker Areva SA, and a second manufacturer Balz declined to
identify are competing to supply the turbines for Deutsche
Bucht, he said. Construction may start in 2013, Balz said.  Volkswagen plans to invest about 1 billion euros ($1.4
billion) in wind, solar and hydro projects in the next two
years, the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper reported Aug.
25, citing company officials that it didn’t identify. Volkswagen
is talking to four developers, including Windreich, about
possible investments, the newspaper wrote.  Christoph Adomat, a Volkswagen spokesman, said in an e-mail
last week that the company seeks to increase usage of renewable
sources to become an “economic and ecologic” leader in the
global car sector. He declined to comment on the specifics of
the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
