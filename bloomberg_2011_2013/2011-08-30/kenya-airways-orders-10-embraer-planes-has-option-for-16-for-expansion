Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
Africa’s third-biggest carrier, agreed to buy 10 aircraft from
 Embraer SA (EMBR3)  and signed an option to acquire another 16.  The Embraer 190 aircraft will be delivered between July
2012 and 2013, Titus Naikuni, the chief executive officer of the
Kenyan company, told reporters today in Nairobi.  “These aircraft will help us in opening new routes and
increasing frequencies on existing routes,” Naikuni said. Kenya
Airways already operates 10 planes from the Brazilian
manufacturer.  Embraer plans to double the number of its planes operated
by African carriers over the next two to three years, Mathieu
Duquesnoy, vice president for  Middle East  and Africa, told
reporters in Nairobi today. The aircraft manufacturer has 130
planes operated by African carriers, Duquesnoy said.  Kenya Airways said on April 14 that it agreed to buy nine
Boeing Corp. 787 aircraft in an accord that includes an option
for another four aircraft. The latest 787s will be delivered in
October 2013, Kenya Airways said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
