The original “Pink Panther” car
and a replica of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang may raise as much as
350,000 pounds ($570,000) in an online auction.  Fans of 1960s and 1970s shows will be attracted by the
vehicles, even though the “Panthermobile” is no longer running
and the “Chitty” hasn’t been driven in 18 months. Both are
being sold by the Manchester,  England , corporate-recovery
company  Robson Kay .  The auction, which comes as prices of the rarest
collectable cars rise, is being run on behalf of an unidentified
U.K. finance company that funded the purchases for a private
collector from north-west England. The auction, hosted by
 bidspotter.com , will begin at noon on Sept. 4, and run through
Oct. 14.  “The collector used finance to buy them,” Jonathan Kay,
co-founder of Robson Kay, said in an interview. “The payments
weren’t coming through and the agreement has been terminated.”  The “Panthermobile” was created in 1969 to be part of the
NBC’s “Pink Panther” TV show, which ran until 1976. The one-
off vehicle was the brainchild of Jay Ohrberg, a Hollywood
designer sometimes credited for work on the 1966 Batmobile,
Starsky & Hutch’s Ford Torino and the Flintstones’ prehistoric
runabouts.  The futuristic pink supercar was knocked down to Robson
Kay’s unidentified collector at auction in  London  for 88,000
pounds in June 2007. While it is illegal to drive on public
roads, it will be re-offered online with a guide price of 50,000
pounds to 100,000 pounds.  Value Question  “This is a difficult car to value,” Kay said. “It’s a
complete one-off. If two people think it would be a good thing
to put in something like a shopping mall, the sky could be the
limit.”  The Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is a replica built in 2000 by
enthusiast Tony Green, modeled on the six cars used in the 1968
film, starring Dick Van Dyke. The script, by Roald Dahl and Ken
Hughes, was loosely based on a novel by  James Bond ’s creator,
Ian Fleming.  Powered by a 3L V6 Ford engine, the drivable car has the
registration number “GEN 22” and needs a service and some
restoration, the auction house said.  This clone of Fleming’s “phantasmagorical” flying and
floating machine took Green three years to build and was sold by
him for 250,000 pounds in 2007. Robson Kay’s unidentified
collector spent a further 48,720 pounds on the car to
incorporate automatically opening wings and rising propellers
and rotor blades.  If the car sells within its 100,000-pounds to 250,000-
pounds valuation, it won’t have proved a profitable investment.  An original road-going “Chitty” used in the film was sold
by a Beverly Hills auction house for $805,000 in May. It had
been valued at $1 million to $2 million.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
