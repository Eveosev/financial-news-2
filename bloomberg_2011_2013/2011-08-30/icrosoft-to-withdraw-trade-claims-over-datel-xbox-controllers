Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  said it would
withdraw part of its patent-infringement case against Datel
Design & Development Ltd. over controllers for the Xbox 360
video-game system.  Datel redesigned its controllers and stopped importing
versions known as TurboFire2 Xbox 360 Wireless that were at the
heart of a complaint before the U.S. International Trade
Commission in Washington, Microsoft said in a filing yesterday
that sought to withdraw the case. The software maker said it
still will pursue cash compensation for past infringement
through a civil lawsuit lodged against Datel last year.  “Datel’s voluntary exclusion of the accused products from
the U.S. market has obviated the need to devote valuable public
and private resources” of the ITC, Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft said in the filing.  The  controllers  made by Staffordshire, England-based Datel
can turn single-shot electronic pistols used in games like
“Call of Duty” into fully automatic weapons. Closely held
Datel filed an antitrust lawsuit in November against Microsoft,
claiming the company seeks to monopolize the markets for
multiplayer online gaming systems and for accessories not sold
directly with the Xbox. Those claims also are proceeding.  The case is In The Matter of Certain Game Controllers,
337-715, U.S. International Trade Commission ( Washington ). The
antitrust case is Datel Holdings Ltd. v. Microsoft Corp.,
09cv5535, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
 California  ( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
