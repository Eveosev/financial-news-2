Italian bonds fell for a seventh
day, the longest losing streak since February, as demand
weakened at the first auction of 10-year securities since the
 European Central Bank  began buying the nation’s debt.  German bunds advanced, paring yesterday’s drop, after a
report showed confidence in the euro-region’s economic outlook
plunged in August. Italy’s 10-year yields climbed to a three-
week high after Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  bowed to
demands from his coalition ally to overhaul a 45 billion euro
($65 billion) austerity plan that had persuaded the ECB to
support the nation’s bonds. Italy sold 7.74 billion euros of
debt maturing in 2014, 2018 and 2022.  “The market is still wary about being long Italian bonds
because there’s more supply coming,” said  Christoph Rieger ,
head of fixed-income strategy at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt .
“There was a muted response to the auction. Investors are
nervous because the ECB has not been as active as some might
have hoped. Consumer-sentiment data and the Italian auction are
combining to support bunds.”  Italy ’s 10-year bond yield increased two basis points to
5.11 percent as of 4:03 p.m. in London. They earlier climbed to
5.16 percent, the highest since Aug. 10. The 4.75 percent
security due in September 2021 fell 0.150, or 1.50 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 97.70. Yields on two-year notes rose
three basis points, to 3.44 percent.  Demand Falls  The nation sold 3.75 billion euros of 5 percent bonds
maturing in March 2022 at an average yield of 5.22 percent.
Investors bid for 1.27 times the amount on offer. That compares
with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.38 at the prior auction of
similar-dated debt on July 28, which was sold at 5.77 percent.  “The bid-to-cover ratios are slightly lower, which may
pressure the bonds,” said Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income
strategist at  Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich. “It looks as if
the Italian Treasury only needed to make moderate concessions in
order to get their bonds sold, and the market is not in any way
boycotting this auction.”  Italy also auctioned 2.99 billion euros of notes due in
July 2014 at an average yield of 3.87 percent, and 995 million
euros of floating-rate securities due in April 2018 at a yield
of 4.52 percent.  The yield on the 10-year bund dropped eight basis points to
2.15 percent. It fell to a record 2.03 percent on Aug. 18.
Yields on two-year notes were also eight basis points lower at
0.66 percent. They declined to 0.54 percent on Aug. 18, the
least since June 30, 2010.  Consumer Sentiment  An index of euro-region executive and consumer sentiment
fell to 98.3 from a revised 103 in July, the European Commission
in Brussels said today. That’s the lowest level since May 2010.  Confidence among U.S. consumers plunged in August to the
lowest in more than two years, a separate report showed.  Spain  plans to sell up to 4 billion euros of 4.25 percent
notes due in October 2016 on Sept. 1. Spanish 10-year bond
yields were little changed at 5.01 percent, while two-year
yields fell two basis points to 3.32 percent.  “Further selling pressure is on the cards given the
Spanish five-year auction,”  Michael Leister , a fixed-income
strategist at WestLB AG in London, wrote in a note to investors.  The difference in yield, or spread, between Italy’s 10-year
bonds and similar-maturity German bunds widened nine basis
points to 2.97 percentage points. It reached 3 percentage
points, the most since Aug. 9. The spread between Spanish and
German 10-year bonds expanded eight basis points to 2.87
percent.  ECB Purchases  The ECB has restrained Italian and Spanish borrowing costs
in the past three weeks by buying bonds in the secondary market
after contagion from the sovereign-debt crisis sent yields to
euro-era records at the start of this month.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said yesterday it settled 6.65
billion euros of bond purchases in the week through Aug. 26,
down from 14.3 billion euros in the previous week.  Berlusconi and Italian Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti 
held a seven-hour meeting yesterday with officials of the
 Northern League , a coalition ally that had opposed key elements
of the austerity plan, which aimed to balance the budget in
2013. They agreed to drop a tax on the highest earners and limit
funding cuts to regional governments.  The country’s weak growth makes deficit and debt goals
“difficult,” Bank of Italy Deputy Director General Ignazio Visco said today. Speaking in testimony before the Senate in
 Rome , Visco said Italy’s debt has been the country’s biggest
problem for three decades.  German  government bonds  have returned 5.2 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while Treasuries
have returned a gain of 7.1 percent. Italian bonds have gained
0.4 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
