Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  seeks
to force  Giants Stadium  LLC to produce documents related to its
role as partner in an interest-rate swap deal, according to a
court filing. Giants Stadium had a $301.8 million claim on
bankrupt Lehman and its derivatives unit, which it sold in July,
according to filings.  Lehman said it would file some of the documents under seal
to protect confidential information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
