Sugar prices may drop at least 13
percent by early next year as an increase in supplies from
Europe and  Asia  counter a drop in production in Brazil,
according to broker and researcher  Kingsman SA .  The March-delivery contract may drop below 25 cents a pound
on ICE Futures U.S. in New York starting January, Managing
Director  Jonathan Kingsman , said in a phone interview from
Lausanne,  Switzerland , yesterday. The contract traded 1 percent
lower at 28.69 cents a pound at 5 p.m. in Mumbai.  A drop in prices of the sweetener, used in everything from
cereals to candy, may help cap global food costs tracked by the
 United Nations  that advanced to a record in February. Kingsman
joins Rabobank International and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in
predicting lower sugar prices, citing increased supplies.
Goldman Sachs forecasts the price may fall to 20 cents a pound
in 12 months, it said in an Aug. 11 report.  “We would expect prices to ease but not fall dramatically
on higher global production,” Kingsman said. “The surplus will
mainly be in white sugar next year.”  Production gains in  Russia , the European Union, Thailand
and India may help the global sugar surplus to reach 9.5 million
metric tons in the 2011-2012 season, Rabobank International said
on Aug. 24. The surplus may be used to replenish global
inventory, it said. It may take two years to rebuild stockpiles
pared by a 15 million-ton deficit left by smaller crops in
2008-2009 and 2009-2010,  Sergey Gudoshnikov , senior economist at
the  International Sugar Organization  said on July 26.  Price Incentive  Sugar futures reached a six-month high last week on concern
that cane production in Brazil will drop for the first time in
six years because of adverse weather, paring global surplus. Raw
sugar for October delivery fell 0.27 cent, or 0.9 percent, to
settle at 29.62 cents a pound today on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York .  “We expect that high prices should give an incentive to
increase acreage of  sugar beet  and sugar cane on a worldwide
basis,” Michaela Kuhl, an analyst at Commerzbank AG, said by
phone from  Frankfurt  today. “We don’t think prices will stay at
the current levels. We think they will come down a little bit.”  Commerzbank expects futures to average about 25 cents in
2012, she said.  Brazil’s sugar cane production in the Center South, the
world’s biggest producing region, will be 498 million tons in
the 2011-2012 season, down from 525 million tons estimated in
July after last year’s drought and heavy rains this year,
Kingsman said Aug. 26. Sugar output will be 30.63 million tons,
less than the 31.87 million forecast earlier, and down from 33.5
million tons last season, Kingsman said.  Poor Weather  “Weather has been quite poor in Brazil and they haven’t
been able to get on with their planting,” Kingsman said. “They
haven’t been able to plant as much new cane they would have
liked. So we don’t expect Brazilian production to start picking
up again until 2013.”  The sugar output in  India , the world’s second-biggest
producer, may climb 7.4 percent to 26 million tons in the year
starting Oct. 1, from 24.2 million tons this year, Kingsman
said. Exports may total 3 million tons to 4 million tons during
the 12-month period, he said.  “Indian exports will have to fill in the gap left by the
Brazil shortfall,” he said. “This is fairly a unique
opportunity for India as it will be in a surplus when the world
actually needs sugar,” said.  China , the biggest sugar consumer after India, may buy as
much as 2.5 million tons in 2012, up from an estimated 2.3
million tons this year, Kingsman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
