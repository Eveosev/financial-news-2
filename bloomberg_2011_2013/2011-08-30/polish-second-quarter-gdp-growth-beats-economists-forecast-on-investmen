Poland’s economy grew faster than
expected in the second quarter as fixed-investment growth offset
slowing consumer demand.  Gross domestic product grew 4.3 percent from a year
earlier, compared with a 4.4 percent rise in the previous three
months, the  Central Statistics Office  said today in a statement.
The result compares with the 4.2 percent median estimate of 30
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Fixed investment grew 7.8 percent from a year earlier, up
from 6 percent in the first quarter, while private consumption
was 3.5 percent, down from 3.9 percent. Capital expenditures and
inventory-building accounted for more than half of second-
quarter growth, while consumption’s contribution shrank to 1.9
percentage points from 2.9 points in the first quarter,
according to estimates from the statistics office.  “I’m very pleased by the investment totals,” Anna Zielinska-Glebocka of the Monetary Policy Council said in an
interview on TVN CNBC after the figures. “I think we can expect
economic growth of more than 4 percent for the whole year.”  Poland’s economic condition “doesn’t suggest the need for
 interest-rate  cuts,” Zielinska-Glebocka said.  In July, the  Narodowy Bank Polski  lowered its GDP growth
projections to 4 percent for this year and 3.2 percent for 2012
from 4.2 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively. The bank left
the benchmark seven-day interest rate at 4.5 percent in July,
after raising it by 1 percentage point in four stages between
January and June.  The zloty was little changed after the GDP data, trading at
4.1479 at 10:07 a.m. in Warsaw, 0.2 percent stronger on the day.
The yield on the five-year Treasury bond was 5.598 percent, up
six basis points from 5.535 percent late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
