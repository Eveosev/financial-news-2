India ’s rupee completed its worst
month since May 2010 as slowing economic growth spurred sales of
the nation’s assets by foreign investors.  Asia’s third-largest economy expanded 7.7 percent last
quarter from a year earlier, the smallest gain since 2009, a
government report showed today. Overseas funds cut holdings of
Indian shares by $2.3 billion this month through Aug. 29, the
most since October 2008. The rupee also dropped on speculation
oil importers bought dollars to pay month-end bills. Local
financial markets are shut tomorrow and Sept. 1 for holidays.  “The performance of stocks has largely been the driver for
the rupee,” said Vikas Babu, a currency trader at state-owned
 Andhra Bank  in Mumbai. “Month-end oil demand also pressured the
rupee.”  The rupee fell 4.1 percent this month to 46.09 per dollar
as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, the worst performance among
 Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It declined 0.1 percent today.  Offshore forwards indicate the Indian currency will trade
at 46.45 to the dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 46.48 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy
or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
