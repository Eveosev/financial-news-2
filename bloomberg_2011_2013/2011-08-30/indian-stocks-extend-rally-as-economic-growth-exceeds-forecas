Indian stocks advanced for a second
day after the country’s economic growth beat analyst estimates,
and as higher U.S. consumer spending allayed concerns about a
faltering economic recovery.  The economy expanded 7.7 percent in the quarter ended June
30 from a year ago, the government said today. The median of 26
estimates in a Bloomberg survey was for a 7.6 percent increase.
Reliance Industries Ltd., which operates the world’s biggest
oil-refining complex, jumped 4.9 percent, pacing gains among
producers of basic materials. Tata Steel Ltd., the nation’s
largest producer, increased 5.4 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose
1.7 percent to 16,698.88, according to preliminary closing
prices in  Mumbai . The measure had its biggest two-day advance
since July 2009. The Sensex advanced yesterday after five weeks
of losses, which was the longest losing streak since October
2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. froze
credit markets.  -- With assistance from Tanya Ashreena. Editor: Ravil Shirodkar  To contact the reporter on this story:
