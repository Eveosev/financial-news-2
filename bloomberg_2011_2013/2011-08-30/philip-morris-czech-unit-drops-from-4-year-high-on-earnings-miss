Philip Morris CR AS (TABAK)  slipped from its
highest in more than four years after first-half profit missed
estimates at the Czech unit of the U.S. cigarette maker.  The stock fell 1.3 percent to 10,750 koruna as of 9:47 a.m.
in Prague, the worst performance in the PX equity gauge, which
increased 0.8 percent. Yesterday, Philip Morris CR rose 3.6
percent to 10,895 koruna, its highest close since July 2007.  Net income from January to June was 1.13 billion koruna
($68 million), up 1 percent from a year earlier, the company
said late yesterday on its website. The average estimate of
three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 1.16 billion koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
