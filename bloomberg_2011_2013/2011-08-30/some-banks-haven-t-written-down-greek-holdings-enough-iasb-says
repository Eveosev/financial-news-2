Some European banks have not
sufficiently written down their holdings of Greek  government
bonds  and other “distressed sovereign debt,” the organization
that sets accounting rules in the region said today.  Banks and other financial institutions are in some cases
valuing these bond holdings in a way that reflects internal
models more than market price, the  International Accounting
Standards Board  said in a  letter  published on its website today.  “It is hard to imagine that there are buyers willing to
buy these bonds at the prices indicated,” the IASB said in the
letter, dated Aug. 4 and sent to the European Securities and
Markets Authority. “This is a matter of great concern to us,”
it said.  Governments and banks in the 27-nation European Union are
negotiating the details of a second international rescue for
 Greece . EU leaders agreed on July 21 that the package should
include about 50 billion euros from bondholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
