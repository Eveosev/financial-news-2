Stada Arzneimittel AG (SAZ)  and Hungary’s
Gedeon Richter Nyrt. signed licensing and cooperation agreements
for the development and marketing of two biosimilar products
used for cancer treatment.  Under the deal, Stada receives non-exclusive rights to
distribute the active ingredient Rituximab, which Richter is
developing, in  Europe  and the Commonwealth of Independent
States, excluding  Russia , Richter said in an e-mailed statement
today.  In addition to payment of an unspecified amount on the
signing of the agreement, Stada will make further payments to
Richter depending on the progress of the development of
Rituximab to a total of “low double-digit million euros,”
Richter said. Regulatory approval of the product is expected at
the end of 2017, the company added.  Richter, in turn, will purchase from Stada the active
ingredient Trastuzumab, also under the development, for a “low
single-digit million euro figure,” Richter said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
