A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate
credit risk rose from the lowest level in almost two weeks
before reports that may show U.S. house prices and  consumer
confidence  weakened.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, rose 2.4 basis points to a mid-
price of 122.8 basis points as of 8:50 a.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, declined
yesterday to 120.3 basis points, the lowest level since Aug. 18,
after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben. S. Bernanke said the worldâ€™s
biggest economy is gradually recovering.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
