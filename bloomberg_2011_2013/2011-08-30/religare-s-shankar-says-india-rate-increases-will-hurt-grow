Jay Shankar, chief economist at
Religare Capital Markets Ltd., comments on  India ’s economic
growth. Gross domestic product rose 7.7 percent in the three
months ended June 30 from a year earlier, the government said
today. The median of 26 predictions in a Bloomberg News survey
was for a 7.6 percent gain. Shankar spoke in a phone interview
from Mumbai.  “The latest number is only marginally higher than what we
had predicted but the devil is in the detail. Manufacturing
sector has slowed down and that is an area of concern and to be
happy about as well. The central bank has been targeting this to
curtail inflation.  ‘‘We are at the inflection point in terms of growth-
inflation dynamics. Any further rate hike is likely to hurt
growth more than curb inflation. So, the central bank shouldn’t
raise rates.  ‘‘The mandate of inflation management unfortunately is left
only to the central bank in India. If we believe that fiscal
consolidation is highly unlikely to come through in this fiscal
year, that means only monetary policy tools are left to curb
inflation.  ‘‘We are almost at the inflection point where growth
dynamics reverses. So, further rate hikes may prove to be more
harmful for the economy and may lead you into a vicious circle
of low growth and high inflation because the demand-supply gap
starts widening.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
