Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 3 p.m. close.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 0.4 percent to 2,566.60. The  CSI
300 Index (SHSZ300)  dropped 0.4 percent to 2,841.74.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  (601939 CH), the nation’s
second-biggest bank by market value, advanced 0.9 percent to
4.54 yuan, the most since Aug. 25. Bank of America Corp. agreed
to sell about half its stake in the Chinese lender to a group of
investors. The companies are also discussing an expansion of
strategic ties. The sale removed concern that the shares would
be “dumped into the market,” said Danny Yan, a Hong Kong-based
portfolio manager at Haitong International Asset Management,
which oversees $600 million.  Tianjin FAW Xiali Automobile Co. (000927 CH) slid 1.8
percent to 8.23 yuan. The automaker said first-half net income
fell 84 percent from the same period a year ago to 46 million
yuan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
