Investors in CVC Capital Partners
Ltd., a U.K. private-equity firm, plan to question the firm over
bribery allegations made in connection with its purchase of the
Formula One car-racing series, the Financial Times reported,
citing unidentified investors.  CVC, which holds its annual investors meeting on Sept. 14,
bought Formula One from banks including  Germany ’s Bayerische
Landesbank for $1.7 billion in 2005; Munich prosecutors, among
others, are investigating Formula One chief  Bernie Ecclestone 
over payments he made to Gerhard Gribkowsky, a former BayernLB
banker who was arrested in January and has been in custody, the
newspaper said.  Ecclestone hasn’t been charged with any offense, the FT
said.  CVC, which has never been accused of any wrongdoing and
said in January that it had no knowledge of any payments made to
Gribkowsky, declined to comment on the prospect of questioning
by investors, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
