U.S. natural gas production in the
lower 48 states increased 0.1 percent in June to the highest
level since at least 2005, the Energy Department said.  Production rose to 69.47 billion cubic feet a day from a
revised 69.39 billion in May, the department’s Energy
Information Administration said today in a monthly report known
as  EIA-914 . That’s the highest level since department began
collecting monthly lower-48 data in January 2005.  “Rising production is going to add pressure on gas
prices,” said  James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics,
an energy research firm in  London , Arkansas. “Production will
probably remain at a high level with the rig count staying
around 900.”  The number of U.S. gas drilling rigs dropped 2 last week to
898, according to Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc.  Natural gas for October delivery gained 7.9 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $3.909 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Prices have dropped 11 percent this
year.  Total U.S. production, including Alaska, dropped 0.4
percent to 77.75 billion cubic feet from a revised 78.08
billion.  Output from federal offshore waters in the  Gulf of Mexico 
declined 4.3 percent to 5.07 billion cubic feet a day and
production in  Texas  fell 1.1 percent to 21.76 billion. Wyoming
gained 1.4 percent to 6.51 billion cubic feet a day and Oklahoma
increased 2 percent to 5.21 billion.  The EIA-914 report covers gas gross withdrawals, which
include gas used for repressuring, quantities vented and flared,
and non-hydrocarbon gas removed in treating or processing
operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
