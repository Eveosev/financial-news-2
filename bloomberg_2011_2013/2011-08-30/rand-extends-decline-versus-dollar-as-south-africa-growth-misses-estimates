The rand extended its decline
against the dollar after  South Africa ’s economy expanded at a
slower rate than analysts estimated in the second quarter.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated 0.4
percent to 7.0787 per dollar by 11:32 a.m. in Johannesburg. It
traded at 7.0648 before the data were released.  Economic growth slowed to an annualized 1.3 percent in the
second quarter from a revised 4.5 percent in the first three
months of the year, Statistics South Africa said in a report
today. The median estimate of 18 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for 1.6 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
