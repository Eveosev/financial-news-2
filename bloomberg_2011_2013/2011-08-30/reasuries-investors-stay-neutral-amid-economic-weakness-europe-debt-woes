Treasuries investors remained
neutral in the latest week, as a weakened economic outlook and
the European debt crisis kept curbed directional bets, according
to an Aug. 29 survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  About 83 percent of the clients surveyed by the primary
dealer were neutral, just less than the 85 percent in the
previous week. About 13 percent were short, up from 11 percent
of investors betting that the price of the securities would fall
the previous week.  “Rates have already priced in a lot of economic
weakness,” said Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in New
York, in a phone interview. “Except for the risk from  Europe ,
there would be more investors positioning for higher rates.”  The percentage of investors in the survey betting that
Treasury prices will increase was unchanged at four percent. The
firm surveys clients on positions relative to the respondents’
benchmark. JPMorgan does not disclose the number of clients in
the survey.  Commerce Department figures last week showed the economy
grew at a 1 percent annual pace in the second quarter. GDP grew
by 0.4 percent in the first quarter.  European confidence in the economic outlook plunged the
most since December 2008 this month as a persistent debt crisis
roiled markets and clouded growth prospects across the 17-nation
euro region.  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes dropped eight basis
points, to 2.18 percent in  New York , according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
