Former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader testified at an investigation today that he didn’t take
a bribe from Mol Nyrt. to give the Hungarian refiner control of
 Croatia ’s INA Industrija Nafte d.d., the HINA newswire reported.  Sanader was to be interrogated today by the  Office for
Suppression of Corruption and Organized Crime  at the  Remetinec 
jail near Zagreb, his lawyer Cedo Prodanovic said late
yesterday. Sanader reiterated his earlier statement that he was
innocent of the bribery charges and said government members,
coalition partners and the president knew the details of
agreement with MOL, Hina reported.  Sanader, who resigned in July 2009, is under suspicion for
corruption and abuse of power in several cases involving state
companies, Croatian refiner INA and Hypo Alpe Adria Bank d.d., a
Croatian unit of Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International AG.  He was arrested in  Austria  in December and extradited to
Croatia in July.  To contact the reporter on the story:
