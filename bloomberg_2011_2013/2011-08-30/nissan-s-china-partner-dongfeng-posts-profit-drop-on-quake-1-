Dongfeng Motor Group Co., the
Chinese partner of Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co., posted
a 10 percent decline in first-half profit as slowing demand and
production disruptions after  Japan ’s earthquake hurt sales.  Net income in the first six months fell to 5.9 billion yuan
($925 million), or 0.68 yuan per share, from 6.53 billion yuan,
or 0.76 yuan, a year earlier, the company said in a filing to
the Hong Kong stock exchange today. That beat the 5.5 billion
yuan average of four analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The automaker faced output disruptions after Japan’s March
11 earthquake and tsunami caused shortages of electricity and
parts at Nissan and Honda. Shipments have also slowed in China
this year after the government reinstated a 10 percent sales tax
on small cars and phased out trade-in subsidies in rural areas.  First-half sales at the Wuhan, Hubei province-based
Dongfeng rose 3 percent to 63.7 billion yuan. The country sold
9.3 million automobiles in the first six months, up 3.4 percent
from a year earlier, according to the  China  Association of
Automobile Manufacturers.  Dongfeng rose 5.8 percent to HK$12.72 at the 4 p.m. close
in Hong Kong trading, before the announcement. The stock has
declined 5.1 percent this year compared with a 12 percent drop
in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  Macroeconomic Uncertainties  China will face macroeconomic uncertainties in the second
half and the automobile industry may “grow at a slower speed as
compared to the corresponding period of 2010,” Dongfeng, which
has a market share of about 11 percent in China, said today.  Nissan restarted normal operations in China in June as the
company prioritized shipments of auto parts to the country and
 North America , Shiro Nagai, a spokesman at the Yokohama-based
carmaker, said Aug. 29.  Dongfeng’s venture with Nissan announced plans on July 26
to invest 50 billion yuan by 2015. The partners will increase
the number of dealers to 2,400 from 1,400, and aim to raise
annual auto sales to more than 2.3 million from 1.3 million.  Dongfeng had net income of 2.86 billion yuan in the first
quarter of the year, the company said on April 29.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
