Mauritian stocks rose to a two-week
high amid signs the global economy is recovering, boosting
demand for riskier, frontier-market assets.  The 38-member SEMDEX gauge advanced for a second day,
increasing 0.3 percent to 1,950.66 by the 1:30 p.m. close in
 Port Louis , led by Mauritius Commercial Bank, the biggest lender
by market value, which gained 0.6 percent to 172 rupees.
Mauritius’s market will likely be closed tomorrow for the Muslim
Eid Al-Fitr holiday.  Emerging-market stocks advanced, with the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index heading for its largest three-day gain since Dec.
3, after reports showed Americans’ spending increased more than
economists forecast while incomes grew at the projected pace.  “The bearish wave that engulfed markets is slowly
receding,” analysts at Mauritius Commercial Bank wrote in an e-
mailed research note today. “Investors have started to tread
carefully into risky-asset territory lately, but are on the
lookout for any negative signs.”  Mauritius’s rupee weakened 0.7 percent to 27.95 per dollar,
trimming its second monthly gain to 0.2 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Versus the euro, the currency of its
main trading partner, the rupee depreciated 0.1 percent to
40.2878, extending its loss in August to 0.3 percent.  Buying prices for the dollar were from 27.0903 to 27.2594
rupees, while the selling price was 28.5508 per dollar, compared
with 28. 583 on Aug. 29, according to  indicative exchange rates 
published today on the Bank of Mauritius’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
