Canadian farmers planted 14 percent
fewer grains than they intended from April through June because
of wet weather during seeding, Hamburg-based Oil World said.  The area seeded with wheat, corn, barley and oats fell to
13.9 million hectares (34.3 million tons) this year, down from
intentions of 16.2 million hectares before planting started, the
researcher said today in a report. Wheat growers seeded 8.75
million hectares, down 13 percent from intentions, Oil World
said. Rain during planting kept farmers from using heavy
equipment.  “Excessively wet conditions prevented timely plantings in
the spring of 2011,” Oil World said. “The difference between
actual plantings and intentions is most pronounced for the four
major grains.”  Production of the grains will outpace last year’s crop,
also cut by rainfall during harvest, by 1 percent at 45.2
million metric tons, Oil World said. Wheat output will rise 3.9
percent to 24 million tons, barley production by 8.7 percent to
8.27 million tons and oat growers may collect 2.89 million tons,
up 26 percent, according to the report.  Wheat futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade are
little changed this year and corn is up 22 percent.  Exports Decline  Canola production will rise 6.5 percent to 13.2 million
tons, Oil World said. Stockpiles will fall 8.2 percent from a
year ago to 900,000 tons, the researcher said. That’s less than
half the 2.12 million tons that were in storage at the end of
the 2009-2010 marketing year, according to the report.  Because stockpiles are expected to be low, exports will
decline 4.9 percent to 6.8 million tons, the researcher said.
Canada is the biggest shipper of the oilseed. Domestic
processing of the grain will rise 0.6 percent, Oil World said.
Canola futures on ICE Futures Canada in Winnipeg are up 25
percent in the past year.  Canadian soybean production may fall 11 percent to 3.86
million tons this year as adverse weather during the growing
season cut yields, the company said. Domestic use will rise 2.5
percent while exports are expected to drop 11 percent, according
to the report. Soybean prices are up 2.8 percent this year.  “Weather was less than ideal this year and the average
yield is expected to decline,” Oil World said. “With Canadian
soybean crushings likely to rise, we expect soybean exports to
be reduced.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
