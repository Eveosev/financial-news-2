Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ,  Canada ’s third-
largest bank, reported quarterly profit that topped analysts’
estimates, led by its international business.  Net income in the third quarter ended July 31 rose 22
percent to C$1.29 billion ($1.31 billion), or C$1.11 a share,
from C$1.06 billion, or 98 cents, a year earlier, the Toronto-
based bank said today in a statement. It was the eighth straight
quarter of earnings growth.  Scotiabank, which has operations in 50 countries including
Mexico and  Thailand , said profit from international banking
climbed 27 percent to C$350 million on increases in commercial
lending and higher consumer loans in Chile and  Peru . The bank
has spent about $2 billion on foreign acquisitions in the last
five years.  “We’ve always thought there was a huge potential in  Latin
America  with the growing middle class there,” said David Baskin, who oversees about C$425 million at Baskin Financial
Services in Toronto, including Scotiabank shares. “Bank of Nova
Scotia’s had a long-standing position there; they’ve paid their
dues, so now they’re getting payback.”  Before one-time items, the bank said it earned C$1.14 a
share, topping the C$1.12-a-share estimate of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Canadian Banking  Scotiabank rose C$1.15, or 2.2 percent, to C$53.50 in 4
p.m. trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares have
fallen 6.3 percent this year, compared with a 2.8 percent drop
on the 10-member S&P/TSX Banks Index.  Profit from Canadian banking increased 4.3 percent to C$461
million on deposit growth, while asset-management earnings
climbed 16 percent to C$256 million. Earnings from its Scotia
Capital investment bank dropped 5.2 percent to C$289 million
because of an increase in loan-loss provisions and higher
expenses.  Chief Executive Officer Richard Waugh told investors on a
conference call that Scotiabank is looking at ways to reduce
costs, although the bank isn’t considering layoffs or closures.  Capital markets had “a weak quarter, as trading and
advisory revenues were down sequentially,” Barclays Capital
analyst  John Aiken  said in a note to clients today. “This is
not out of line with the other banks that have reported.”  The bank set aside C$243 million for bad loans, down from
C$276 million a year ago.  CIBC Tomorrow  Scotiabank is the fourth Canadian bank to report third-
quarter results.  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  said Aug. 23 that profit
climbed 19 percent to C$793 million.  National Bank of Canada (NA) 
reported earnings of C$312 million, up 15 percent. Royal Bank of
Canada, the country’s largest bank, reported a net loss of C$92
million. Royal Bank’s profit missed analysts’ estimates, while
National and Bank of Montreal topped expectations.  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is scheduled to report
results tomorrow, followed by  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  Sept. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
