Ghana ’s cedi depreciated for a
second day against the dollar as investors sold bonds and
converted the proceeds into the U.S. currency.  The currency of the world’s second largest cocoa producer
declined as much as 0.3 percent to 1.5298 per dollar, before
trading 0.2 percent weaker at 1.5282 per dollar as of 3:09 p.m.
in Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’ve seen some dollar demand from offshore players
today,” Kevin Adarkwa, a currency trader at the local unit of
Standard Chartered Bank Plc, said in a telephone interview. “It
was related to converting bond investments for cash.”  Investors in the West African nation’s three-year local
currency bonds were asking for a yield of 12.65 percent today,
compared with 13 percent at a government auction on June 3,
Jacob Brobbey, a bond trader at the local unit of Barclays Bank
Plc, said in a telephone interview. Ghana’s latest five-year
bonds, which yielded 14.25 percent at the primary auction on
July 28, were offered at 14.05 percent and received bids at
14.15 percent, he said.  “Most of these of these offers are from offshore
investors,” Brobbey said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
