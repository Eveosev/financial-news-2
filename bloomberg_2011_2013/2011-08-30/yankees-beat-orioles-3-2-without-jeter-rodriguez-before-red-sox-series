Freddy Garcia returned from the
disabled list to pitch the  New York Yankees  to a 3-2 win over
the Baltimore Orioles.  Garcia allowed two hits over six innings and Nick Swisher
hit a home run at Camden Yards in Baltimore. The Yankees won
their second straight game without Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez -- both out with injuries -- to pull within 1 1/2
games of first-place Boston in the American League East.  The Yankees earned a split of the four-game series by
winning the final two games. They’ll next face Boston in a
three-game Major League Baseball series that begins today at
Fenway Park.  The National League East-leading Philadelphia Phillies beat
the Cincinnati Reds 3-2, while the New York Mets swept a double-
header against the  Florida Marlins , winning 2-1 and 5-1.  The Toronto Blue Jays beat the Tampa Bay Rays 7-3 as  Jose Bautista  hit his 38th home run of the season to tie the Yankees’
Curtis Granderson for the major-league lead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
