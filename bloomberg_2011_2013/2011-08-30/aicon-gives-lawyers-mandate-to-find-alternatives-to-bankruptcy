The board of directors of  Aicon SpA (AIC) 
will give legal advisers a mandate to evaluate alternative
solutions to bankruptcy, after the company’s main shareholder,
Airon Srl, didn’t provide financial support needed to ensure the
continuity of the business, the yacht-maker said in a statement
distributed by the Italian stock exchange.  Nobody answered a phone call made to Airon’s main office in
Borsea,  Italy , seeking comment after regular business hours.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
