What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that demand
will slow for U.S. supplies as  Brazil  cuts mandates for crop-
based fuel and overseas buyers use more wheat in livestock feed,
Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as importers reduce purchases from the U.S.,
substituting cheaper grain from suppliers including Russia,
Ukraine and Canada, Grow said.  -- Soybean futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower
in Chicago on speculation that rain this week in parts of the
Midwest will boost U.S. crop yields, Grow said. Soybean-oil
futures are expected to open down 0.3 cent to 0.5 cent a pound,
and soybean-meal futures may open $3 to $5 lower per 2,000
pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
