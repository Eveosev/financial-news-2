Wine worth as much as $8.3 million,
including a 300-bottle collection of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild
spanning every year from 1981 to 2005, is scheduled for sale at
 Christie’s  in  Hong Kong  this week.  The London-based house estimates the 25 cases of the
Bordeaux first-growth wine, which it says have been kept in
pristine condition, may fetch as much as HK$4.5 million
($575,400), or almost $2,000 per bottle. At that price, it would
be the most expensive single lot of wine auctioned this year.  Demand from Asian collectors and investors has helped boost
values of investment-grade vintages as wine has rebounded from
losses sustained during the 2008 financial crisis. The Liv-ex
100 fine wine index has held on to the 6.8 percent gain it made
in the first quarter of this year amid volatility in other
markets, and is up 19.3 percent over the past 12 months.  “I’m struck each time I go to mainland  China  by the
groundswell of demand,” Charles Curtis, Christie’s head of wine
sales for  Asia , said in a telephone interview from  New York .
“There’s nothing but upside to this trend.”  Christie’s is also offering a 3-liter jeroboam of Romanee-
Conti DRC 1971 Burgundy which it says may sell for as much as
HK$320,000.  A six-liter imperial of  Lafite  2003 carries a high estimate
of HK$100,000 while six bottles of 1911 Moet & Chandon Champagne
are also being included as a single charity lot, with the
potential to fetch as much as HK$500,000. The auction is taking
place on Sept. 3 and Sept. 4.  Lafite Imperials  At a separate Hong Kong sale being mounted by New York-
based house  Zachys  on Sept. 9 and Sept. 10, a collection of
Lafite imperials covering the years 1995 to 2003 is up for sale,
along with  Chateau Mouton-Rothschild  from a California
collector.  Bonhams in London will feature two lots of Romanee-Conti
Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Burgundy in its Sept. 8 sale. One,
comprising 12 bottles of the 1990 vintage, carries an estimate
of as much as 120,000 pounds ($196,500) while 12 bottles of the
1988 carry a top estimate of 80,000 pounds.  At  Sotheby’s (BID)  London sale on Sept. 14, Romanee-Conti and
Lafite also top the bill. Two cases of Romanee-Conti 1988 DRC
are on offer at a top estimate of 70,000 pounds each while two
cases of Lafite are also on sale carrying a top estimate of
40,000 pounds. The auction also features Lafite 1986 and  Chateau
Latour  1982.  New York  Hong Kong, now the world’s largest wine auction center,
will also see a sale by  Acker Merrall & Condit , including a 12-
bottle case of Romanee-Conti 1990 DRC estimated to fetch up to
$HK1.6 million, while New York will have sales by Acker, Zachys
and Christie’s. Hart Davis Hart will hold a Chicago sale.  Wine totaling $224.8 million has been sold by the five
largest auction houses so far this year, compared with their
combined sales of $354 million for the whole of 2010.  Auction sales of mature wines may be bolstered after
Chinese and other buyers balked at price rises of as much as 80
percent being asked for Bordeaux’s new vintage offered “en
primeur,” while still in barrels, said dealers.  September Sales  Following is a list of global wine sales scheduled during
