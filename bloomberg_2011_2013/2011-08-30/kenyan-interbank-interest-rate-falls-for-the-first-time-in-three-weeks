Kenya ’s average interbank lending
rate fell for the first time in three weeks yesterday, after the
country’s  central bank  introduced changes to the rules for
obtaining funds through its overnight discount window.  The rate banks charge each other for credit in the East
African nation declined to 27.7299 percent, compared with
28.4440 percent on Aug. 26, the Nairobi-based Central Bank of
Kenya said in an e-mailed statement today. The  interbank rate 
had risen every trading session since Aug. 8, according to
central bank data.  The central bank loosened the requirement regarding the
value of deposits lenders keep in reserves in guidelines that
took effect yesterday. It will include a factor ranging from
zero to one based on the amount of cash in the  interbank market 
to calculate its overnight discount window rate and use a moving
average of interbank lending rates over an unspecified period.  The new rules allow banks to hold cash-reserves equivalent
to 4.75 percent of deposits over a monthly, rather than daily
basis, as long as daily holdings don’t dip below 3 percent.  Kenya’s shilling gained against the dollar for the first
day in four, strengthening 0.2 percent to 93.45 by 10:40 a.m. in
Nairobi. The move pared the currency’s losses against the dollar
this year to 13 percent. The shilling hit a more than 17 year
low of 95.10 against the dollar on Aug. 9.  Kenya’s financial markets will be closed tomorrow for a
public holiday to mark Eid al-Fitr, the end of Muslim holy month
of Ramadan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
