Citigroup Inc. (C)  is raising a $395
million collateralized loan obligation to be managed by Apidos
Capital Management LLC, according to two people with knowledge
of the deal.  The Apidos CLO VIII is expected to include a $264.4 million
piece rated AAA by  Standard & Poor’s , said the people, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private.  There have been more than $7 billion of CLOs backed by
widely syndicated loans raised in the U.S. this year, up from
more than $3.4 billion last year, according to Bloomberg data.
At the peak of the market in 2007 there was $91.1 billion of the
debt issued, according to Morgan Stanley. JPMorgan Chase & Co.
said in an Aug. 12 report it maintains its estimate of $10
billion to $15 billion of CLO issuance this year.  The Apidos fund may also include a $40 million AA piece, a
$27.8 million A slice, a $16 million BBB piece and a $15 million
BB slice, the people said. There is also $31.7 million of
subordinated notes.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  The price of the underlying loans has been falling, hitting
the lowest level the year of 87.47 cents on the dollar Aug. 26,
according to the S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index.  Purvi Kamdar, director of marketing and investor relations
at Resource America Inc., referred a call to  Christopher Allen ,
chief operating officer of New York-based Apidos, who couldn’t
be reached for comment. Apidos is a unit of Resource.  To contact the reporter on this story:
