A warning was issued for coastline
close to  Cape Town  after increased activity by great white
sharks,  News24  said, citing National Sea Rescue Institute
spokesman Craig Lambinon.  The sharks typically move from Seal Island in False Bay at
this time of year and come inshore in search of rays, smaller
sharks and other fish species, the Johannesburg-based online
 news agency  said, citing Lambinon.  South African swimmers, surfers and paddlers have been
warned to be on the alert, particularly on the beaches between
Macassar and Strandfontein and at Fish Hoek, according to
News24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
