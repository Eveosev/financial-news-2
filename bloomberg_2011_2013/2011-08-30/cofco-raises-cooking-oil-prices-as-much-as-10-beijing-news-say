Cofco Ltd., China’s biggest grain
trader, is raising cooking oil prices by 5 percent to 10
percent, even as the country struggles to contain the fastest
inflation in three years, Beijing News reported today, citing a
Cofco executive it didn’t identify.  The company is raising prices of its  soybean oil  and
blended vegetable oils sold nationwide and sent notices to
supermarkets that carry those products, the newspaper quoted the
official as saying. The move followed  Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL) ,
the biggest seller of retail cooking oil in China, which raised
the prices of its products earlier this month, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
