Poland ’s WIG20 Index advanced 30.38,
or 1.3 percent, to 2,382.94 as of 9:53 a.m. in Warsaw, heading
for the second day of gains.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s largest copper
producer, jumped 2 percent to 167.7 zloty for the longest streak
of gains since June 27. Copper advanced for a fifth session on
optimism that the U.S. economy will recover and speculation that
workers at Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.’s Grasberg mine
may strike after talks on wages ended with no agreement.  PBG SA (PBG)   jumped 4.3 percent to 95.75 zloty, poised
for the biggest daily advance since July 4 after Poland’s third-
largest builder reported better-than-expected first-half
earnings. Net income rose to 97.5 million zloty ($34 million)
from 61.2 million zloty a year earlier.  The  Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW)   rose 1.6 percent to
43.34 zloty for the second day of gains. The operator of the
Polish equity market said first-half net income rose to 71.5
million zloty from 54.4 million zloty a year earlier. That
compares with the 70.1 million-zloty mean estimate of five
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
