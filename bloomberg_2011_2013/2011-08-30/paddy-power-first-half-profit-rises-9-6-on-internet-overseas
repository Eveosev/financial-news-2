Paddy Power Plc (PAP) , Ireland’s biggest
bookmaker, said first-half profit rose 9.6 percent as overseas
and Internet sales offset a slump in Irish betting shops.  Net income climbed to 47.4 million euros ($69 million), or
97 euro cents per share, from 43.2 million euros, or 91 cents,
in the same period a year earlier, the Dublin-based company said
in a statement today.  Irish first-half operating profit dropped 44 percent to 5.1
million euros as bet sizes dwindled and Irish jockeys did well
at Cheltenham horse-racing festival, which helped bettors, the
company said. About 81 percent of the company’s operating profit
was generated online and 73 percent overseas, the company said.  “Ireland’s a tough market; people are obviously cutting
their cloth, reducing their spend,” Finance Director Jack Massey said in a telephone interview. “It’s really been the
online business that’s stood out; mobile was a particular
highlight.”  Paddy Power fell 2.5 percent to 34.60 euros in Dublin
trading. The shares have gained 13 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 1.68 billion euros.  Online operating profit grew 25 percent to 45.3 million
euros, and the 81 percent of profit generated has grown from
about 28 percent in 2004, Massey said.  Mobile sports-betting sales nearly quadrupled, to 157
million euros, or 22 percent of total sports-bet stakes. The
company added live streaming of events on phones for Ascot horse
races in June, Massey said.  Paddy Power expects to open up to 40 betting shops per year
in the U.K. for the next three years, Massey said. So far this
year it’s opened 27, for a total of 151.  To contact the reporter on this story:
