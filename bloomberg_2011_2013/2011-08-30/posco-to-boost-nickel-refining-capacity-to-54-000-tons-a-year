Posco (005490) , the world’s second-biggest
stainless steelmaker, plans to build a 480 billion won ($448
million) nickel refining unit in South Korea with its New
Caledonian partner.  The plant, to be located at Gwangyang, southwest of  Seoul ,
will increase the venture’s nickel production capacity by 80
percent to 54,000 metric tons a year by 2014, Posco said today
in a statement. Societe Nickel de Nouvelle-Caledonie et Coree,
the venture, will start construction next month.  Demand for stainless steel, used in cars and home
appliances, is recovering as the economic growth in  China  and
 India  increases the disposable income of people in the world’s
most populous nations. Stainless-steel companies are the world’s
biggest users of nickel, which accounts for 60 percent of their
manufacturing costs.  The expansion will help boost Posco’s raw material
competitiveness “when global prices of nickel are volatile,”
the Pohang, South Korea-based company said.  Nickel for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange has risen 3.4 percent in the past year. The metal
gained 1.5 percent today to $21,763 a ton.  The venture, set up with Societe Miniere du Sud Pacifique
SA in May 2006, will source raw material from  New Caledonia ,
according to the statement. Posco has a capacity to produce 3
million tons of stainless steel a year and is building plants
and marketing bases in China, Vietnam and Turkey.  Posco shares rose as much as 2.4 percent to 404,000 won and
traded at 401,500 won as of 12:53 p.m. in Seoul trading. The
stock has declined 17 this year, compared with a 10 percent drop
in the benchmark Kospi index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
