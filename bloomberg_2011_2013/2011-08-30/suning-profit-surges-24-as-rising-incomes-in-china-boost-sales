Suning Appliance Co.’s second-
quarter profit rose 24 percent as China’s biggest electronics
retailer opened stores to meet demand boosted by rising wages.  Net income climbed to 1.35 billion yuan ($212 million) in
the three months ended June 30, from 1.09 billion yuan a year
earlier. The results were derived from first-half earnings
announced today by the Nanjing, Jiangsu province-based company.  First-half net income rose 25 percent from a year earlier
to 2.47 billion and sales advanced 23 percent to 44.2 billion
yuan, according to the filing to the Shenzhen stock exchange.  The retailer joins its bigger rival  Gome Electrical
Appliances Holdings Ltd. (493)  in reporting a jump in earnings after
adding stores to tap rising incomes in the world’s second-
biggest economy. China’s electronics and appliances market is
forecast to surge 70 percent to 2.14 trillion yuan by 2015 from
2010, according to London-based researcher Euromonitor
International.  Suning rose 0.6 percent to 11.78 yuan in Shenzhen trading
before the earnings announcement. The stock has dropped 10
percent this year, compared with a 11 percent decline in the
benchmark Shenzhen Composite Index.  Chairman Zhang Jindong established Suning in Nanjing in
1990 as an air-conditioner wholesaler and opened its first
retail chain store six years later. Zhang, a Chinese literature
major from Nanjing Normal University, was  ranked   China ’s eighth
richest person this year by Forbes magazine with a net worth of
$5 billion.  Suning added a net of 140 stores in the first six months,
bringing the total to 1,451 in China. It operates 37 stores in
 Hong Kong  and  Japan , according to the statement.  Per capita urban disposable income rose 13.2 percent in the
first half of the year and rural cash incomes climbed 20.4
percent, China’s statistics bureau said in July.  Gome President Wang Jun Zhou said yesterday the appliance
merchant plans 260 new shops this year and aims for 2,400
outlets by 2014.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
