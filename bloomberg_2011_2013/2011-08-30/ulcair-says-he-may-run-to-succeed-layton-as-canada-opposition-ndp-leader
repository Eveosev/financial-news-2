Thomas Mulcair , deputy leader of
Canada’s New Democratic Party, said he may run for the party’s
top job, which became vacant after the death of  Jack Layton .  Some party members have suggested he run for the
leadership, Mulcair told reporters in Montreal in remarks
broadcast on the RDI television network. He said he needs a few
weeks to make a final decision.  Layton died Aug. 22 after leading the NDP to its best ever
election result in May, which saw it become the largest
opposition group in Parliament. In a letter written just before
his death, Layton asked the party to name a new leader early
next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
