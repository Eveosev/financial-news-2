Finnish Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen  will next week speak to lawmakers about the
northernmost euro member’s economic situation and outlook.  Katainen will make a prime minister’s announcement to the
Helsinki-based parliament on the economic outlook on Sept. 8 at
10 a.m. local time, ahead of a debate on the 2012 budget,
spokesman Juha Kirstilae said by phone today.  The prime minister’s  announcement  is given verbally to
explain a topical matter and no vote or decision will be taken
on it, according to the parliament’s website.  Finland’s economic growth probably slowed to an annual 3.7
percent in the second quarter after expanding 5.1 percent in the
first three months of the year, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said on Aug. 16.  The government plans to cut spending by 1.16 billion euros
($1.7 billion) and raise taxes by 1.1 billion euros for a
deficit of 6.8 billion euros next year, according to a Finance
Ministry proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
