The liquidator of Bernard L. Madoff’s  firm appealed a judge’s ruling on his lawsuit against
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  that threw out almost $9 billion in damages
demanded from HSBC and feeder funds.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in  New York  ruled July 28
that trustee Irving H. Picard has no right to sue on behalf of
customers or the Madoff estate, using common-law claims against
parties “who allegedly violated a duty to Madoff Securities’
customers by failing to detect Madoff’s fraud.” The trustee was
free to pursue $2 billion in bankruptcy claims, Rakoff ruled.  Picard filed a notice of appeal with the  U.S. Court of
Appeals  in New York and the trial judge, according to court
filings yesterday.  Much of the $100 billion Picard is seeking from banks such
as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  involves similar claims to the HSBC
case, or other claims being scrutinized by two district judges.  Rakoff’s decision was “clearly bad news for Picard,” New
York bankruptcy lawyer Harvey Miller said after Rakoff ruled.  The case is Picard v. HSBC, 1:11-cv-00763, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
