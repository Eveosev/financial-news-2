Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., the
Chinese carmaker which assembles vehicles for  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) 
and Honda Motor Co., said first-half profit fell 26 percent
after the March 11 earthquake in  Japan  hurt component shipments.  Net income dropped to 1.72 billion yuan ($270 million), or
0.28 yuan a share, from 2.31 billion yuan, or 0.59 yuan, a year
earlier, Guangzhou Auto said today in a Hong Kong stock exchange
filing. Sales fell 4.5 percent to 27.6 billion yuan.  The maker of Toyota Camry sedans and Honda Fit compacts
said it will pursue unspecified “effective measures” in the
second half to minimize losses brought about by the earthquake.
Industry-wide growth in Chinese car sales should also reach 10
percent in the half after slowing to 3.4 percent in the first
six months from 32 percent in 2010, the company said today.  “The upturn tendency of the Chinese economy as a whole will
remain unchanged and therefore the automobile industry will see
an end to the downturn trend and resume a level of steady and
rapid growth,” Chairman Zhang Fangyou said in the statement.  Guangzhou Auto declined 0.24 percent to close at HK$8.28
prior to today’s earnings announcement. The stock has plunged
almost 23 percent this year, compared with a 12 percent decline
in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  The ventures with Toyota and Honda have suffered severely,
Shanghai-based Phillip Securities (HK) Ltd. analyst Zhang Jing
said in an Aug. 15 note, adding that discounts on offer as the
company struggles to meet sales targets may crimp margins.  Guangzhou Auto sold 314,190 vehicles in the first half, 18
percent fewer than a year earlier, according to figures from the
 China Association of Automobile Manufacturers .  IPO on Track  “Our normal production and operation activities were
seriously disturbed, with output and sales volume lagging behind
business objectives due to the effect caused by the Japanese
earthquake,” the Guangzhou, southern China-based automaker said.  Chinese sales have also slowed as the government reinstates
a 10 percent sales tax on small cars and phases out subsidies
for trade-ins in rural areas.  Guangzhou Auto plans to push ahead with an initial share
sale on the Chinese mainland, according to the statement. The
company listed in  Hong Kong  in August last year by buying shares
of the Denway Motors Ltd. unit it didn’t already own.  --Liza Lin in  Shanghai , Tian Ying in Beijing. Editors:  Chris Jasper , Chua Kong Ho.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
