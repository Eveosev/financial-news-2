(Corrects total amount of shares held.)  New Zealand â€™s Richard Chandler
Capital Corp. bought 1.2 million shares of  Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE)  on
Aug. 24, two days before the stock was suspended from trading by
Canadian regulators. The purchases increased his holdings to 48
million shares, according to a disclosure with Canadian
regulators. Chandler paid C$4.65 a share. The Ontario Securities
Commission suspended Sino-Forest, saying the company may have
misled investors and exaggerated its timber holdings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
