Afren Plc (AFR) , the U.K. oil and gas
explorer focused on  Africa  and Kurdistan, is targeting 930
million barrels of resources by the end of next year as it
drills more wells.  The company now plans to drill 14 wells following
acquisitions of fields in the Iraqi region of Kurdistan, from
nine wells announced in July, Chief Executive Officer Osman Shahenshah said by phone. It will invest more than $1 billion in
Kurdish projects and plans to increase output to 180,000 barrels
of oil equivalent a day net to the company in 2018, up from
25,000 barrels expected this year.  “We have an active program across  East Africa , West Africa
and now Kurdistan,” Shahenshah said. The company’s most
promising exploration wells are in Kurdistan, Nigeria,  Ghana  and
Tanzania, he said.  Afren is in talks with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and other
companies producing oil in Nigeria over the possible acquisition
of fields with as much as 200 million barrels of resources, he
said. The company is ramping up output at its deposits in Africa
and plans to reach 50,000 barrels a day by the end of the year.  Afren shares rose 6 percent to 101.2 pence in  London .  The “second half sees a sharp increase in production and
exploration activity making Afren highly attractive,”  Richard
Griffith , a London-based analyst at Evolution Securities Ltd.,
wrote in an e-mailed report.  The company plans to develop the Barda Rash field in
Kurdistan in  three phases . The first two will require a $135
million investment and will reach production of 35,000 barrels a
day in 2012. The third will raise output to 125,000 barrels of
oil a day by 2017, London-based Afren said today in statement.  The risk of finding natural gas rather than oil “is very
low, because we have three wells in the field that have already
discovered flow of fantastic oil,” Shahenshah said.  Afren first-half net income shrank to $20.7 million, less
than half the profit in the same period a year earlier, because
of production disruptions in  Nigeria , the company also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
