Asian cocoa butter, an ingredient
used to make chocolate, may climb to 1.3 times the price of
cocoa in  London  on increased demand from buyers in  Europe ’s
chocolate industry, according to  ABN Amro  Bank NV and VM Group.  Cocoa butter ratios in  Asia  are 1.1 times the price of
beans on the NYSE Liffe exchange in London, ABN Amro and VM
Group said in a report e-mailed today. The ratio may increase
as demand in Europe picks up, according to the report.  “Grinders in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore all
reported lower ratios as demand for cocoa butter from European
manufacturers has been low over the summer,” Gary Mead, an
analyst at VM Group in London, wrote in the report. “Butter
prices could be set for a rebound, as at these enticingly low
levels they could prompt producers to return to using cocoa
butter instead of cheaper edible oils.”  Edible oils such as  palm oil  can serve as cheaper
substitutes for cocoa butter to make chocolate.  Cocoa for December delivery rose 10 pounds, or 0.5 percent,
to 1,949 pounds (3,173) a ton by 5:03 p.m. on NYSE Liffe.  Supplies of the beans will outpace consumption by 227,000
metric tons in the current season that ends Sept. 30, ABN and VM
Group said in the report. A shortage of 93,000 tons is forecast
for the season starting in October, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
