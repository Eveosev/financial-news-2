The owners of Moscow-based Scartel
LLC, which provides 4G service under the brand Yota, valued the
company for as much as $1 billion for the possible sale to
 Russia ’s three largest mobile-phone operators and OAO
Rostelecom, Vedomosti reported today, citing unidentified people
familiar with the talks.  OAO MegaFon, OAO Mobile TeleSystems, OAO VimpelCom and
long-distance operator Rostelecom agreed to work together to
develop a nationwide fourth-generation broadband network in
March, according to the report.  The four companies had the right to buy 20 percent each of
Yota. Russian Technologies Corp., a state holding company, will
hold a 20 percent stake, newspaper said. The parties still can’t
agree on the price, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
