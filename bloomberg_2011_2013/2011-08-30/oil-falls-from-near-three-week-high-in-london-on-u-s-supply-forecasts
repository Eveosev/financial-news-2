Oil fell from near its highest in
three weeks in  London  on speculation that crude stockpiles are
increasing in the U.S., the biggest consumer of the commodity.  Futures reversed earlier gains as the dollar strengthened,
dimishing the appeal for assets used to protect against
inflation, such as crude. An Energy Department report tomorrow
may show U.S. crude inventories climbed 875,000 barrels last
week. The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  will
release its own data later today.    “I don’t see a lasting rally, given the ongoing risks for
the world economy,” said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. The bank was the third most-
accurate forecaster of oil prices in the second quarter. “It’s
only soft factors like rising stock markets and returning risk
appetite that’s supporting prices.”  Brent oil for October settlement fell as much as 46
cents, or 0.4 percent, to $111.42 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange and was at $111.47 as of 10:20 a.m.
London time. The contract yesterday rose to $112.73, the hgihest
prices since Aug. 4.  Crude for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  was at $86.75 a barrel, down 52 cents. The contract
yesterday climbed $1.90, or 2.2 percent, to $87.27, the highest
settlement since Aug. 17.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
