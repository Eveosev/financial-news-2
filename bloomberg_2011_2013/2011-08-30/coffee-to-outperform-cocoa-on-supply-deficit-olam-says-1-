Coffee may outperform cocoa as
production falls short of demand, tightening global supply, said
 Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) , one of the world’s three biggest
suppliers of both commodities.  “The difficulties in terms of adequate supply and
declining stocks-consumption ratios will support coffee prices
in the near term,” said Sunny Verghese, chief executive officer
of Olam. He did not elaborate on the size of the expected
shortfall.  Arabica coffee has jumped 57 percent in New York in the
past year and robusta surged 44 percent as inventories declined
and output slumped in  Vietnam , the world’s second-biggest
shipper. The global coffee market will have a 4.6 million bag
deficit in the 2011-2012 season, as production of arabica and
robusta beans trails demand, according to a Rabobank
International forecast on Aug. 26. A bag is 60 kilograms.  Stockpiles will be 22.7 million bags, equal to 16 percent
of use, Rabobank said. That’s the smallest ratio ever, according
to U.S. government data.  December-delivery Arabica coffee gained 1.9 percent to
$2.8445 a pound in  New York  yesterday, while Robusta coffee for
November delivery was unchanged at $2,362 a metric ton in
 London .  The global cocoa surplus may be “close” to 400,000 metric
tons in the 2010-2011 season, potentially pushing prices lower,
Verghese said from  Singapore  today. That’s bigger than the
325,000-ton record surplus estimated by the International Cocoa
Organization on Aug. 26.  “Cocoa at this point is oversupplied,” Verghese said.
“We are bearish. There should be pressure on prices in the
near-term,” he said, without elaborating.  December-delivery cocoa climbed 2 percent to $3,135 a ton
in New York yesterday. Futures are up 16 percent in the past
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
