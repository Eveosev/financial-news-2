General Electric Co.. (GE)  the world’s
largest maker of electricity-generation equipment, is investing
in a 10-megawatt solar project in Australia that will use panels
from  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)   GE and Verve Energy, a state-owned utility based in Perth,
will each own half of the Greenough River Solar Farm, the
company’s Stamford, Connecticut-based GE Energy Financial
Services unit said today in a statement. The plant will sell
electricity to the Southern Seawater Desalination Plant that’s
being built by Water Corp.  The Western Australian state government requires new
desalination plants to use power generated by renewable sources
and will provide A$20 million ($21.4 million) for the project.  The solar farm, 50 kilometers (31 miles) southeast of
Geraldton, Western  Australia , is expected to be operational by
mid-2012, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
