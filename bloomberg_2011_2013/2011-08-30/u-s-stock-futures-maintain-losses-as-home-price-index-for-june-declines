U.S. stock futures maintained losses
after an index of  home prices  in 20 U.S. cities dropped 4.5
percent in June from a year earlier.  Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index futures expiring in September
slipped 0.8 percent to 1,198.70 at 9:03 a.m. in New York. The
benchmark gauge for American equities yesterday rose to the
highest level since Aug. 3. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures
lost 67 points, or 0.6 percent, to 11,450 today.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities
fell 4.5 percent from June 2010, after dropping 4.6 percent in
the 12 months ended May, the group said today in New York. The
median forecast of 31 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected a 4.6 percent drop.  A separate report today may show that a gauge of  consumer
confidence  slid to 52 in August from 59.5 previously.  The  S&P 500  has fallen as much as 18 percent from a three-
year high on April 29 amid concern about a global economic
slowdown. Gauges of financial, industrial and energy shares,
which are most-tied to the economy, led the declines in the
index, slumping at least 22 percent over that period.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
