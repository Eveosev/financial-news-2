Tanzania’s shilling appreciated for
a third day against the dollar, paring its decline this month,
as manufacturers sold the greenback to make monthly payments.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy
strengthened as much as 0.8 percent to 1,608.41 per dollar and
traded up 0.3 percent to 1,615.51 by 3:56 p.m. in Dar es Salaam,
the commercial capital, paring its drop this month to 1.6
percent. Tanzanian markets will be closed tomorrow and Sept. 1
for the Muslim Eid Al-Fitr holiday.  “Today its mostly manufacturers who are buying the
shilling to meet their monthly financial obligations such as
paying taxes,” Yonoh Mtengule, chief economist at National Bank
of Commerce Ltd., Absa Group Ltd.’s local unit, said by phone.
“The market has though been generally quiet because of the
public holiday tomorrow and the day after.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
