Bahrainâ€™s economy, measured in
current prices, expanded 20 percent in the second quarter from
the year-ago period, the Manama, Bahrain-based Daily Tribune
reported today, citing a report from the Central Informatics
Organisation.  Growth reflected higher global prices for oil and oil by-
products, the Daily Tribune reported. The negative effects of
protests earlier this year on economic growth are gradually
dissipating, the report said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
