OAO Gazprom filed a request for
arbitration after  Lithuania  sought to oust managers representing
the Russian gas export monopoly at the Lietuvos Dujos AB gas
utility.  Gazprom said the move violated its rights as a shareholder
in the Lithuanian utility, the Russian company said today in a
statement.  The Lithuanian government seeks to oust Lietuvos Dujos
management, alleging it ignored the interests of Lithuania and
didn’t negotiate a fair gas price for Russian supplies . The
Baltic state asked the European Commission on Jan. 25 to
investigate possible market abuse by Gazprom after the company
said Lithuania, unlike neighboring Latvia and  Estonia , won’t
receive gas-price cuts because the country plans to begin
unbundling ownership of its gas industry.  Lithuania hasn’t received any documents from arbitration
yet, the Vilnius-based  Energy Ministry  said in e-mailed
responses to Bloomberg inquiry. The ministry said this may be a
second Gazprom complaint over an investigation at  Lietuvos
Dujos (LDJ1L) , which got rejected by arbitration on this issue once.  Lithuania pays about $100 more than  Germany  for 1,000 cubic
meters of Russian natural gas, the government has previously
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
