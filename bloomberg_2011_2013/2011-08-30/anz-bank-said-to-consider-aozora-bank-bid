Australia  & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. is considering buying Japan’s  Aozora Bank Ltd. (8304)  as
part of a plan to expand in Asia and broaden its funding sources,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  An assessment by ANZ Bank, Australia’s third-largest lender
by market value, of Tokyo-based Aozora is in the early stages
and there’s no guarantee a deal will proceed, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because ANZ Bank’s intentions
haven’t been made public.  Buying Aozora and its pool of customer deposits would ease
ANZ Bank’s reliance on overseas debt markets to fund its lending
business. Chief Executive Officer  Mike Smith  is focusing on
doubling profit generated from  Asia  in the next seven years.  Melbourne-based ANZ Bank’s interest in Aozora was reported
by the Australian Financial Review newspaper yesterday. The bank
has about 3 trillion yen ($39 billion) in deposits, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It has 20 branches and a market
value of about 348 billion yen.  ANZ Bank dropped 0.2 percent to A$20.18 at the 4:10 p.m.
close in Sydney, paring earlier gains. The stock has slid 14
percent this year. Aozora, which climbed 5.4 percent yesterday,
rose a further 8.2 percent to 211 yen in Tokyo today, taking
this year’s gain to 26 percent.  New York-based  Cerberus Capital Management LP  owns 50
percent of Aozora. Cerberus spokesman  Peter Duda  couldn’t be
reached outside of normal business hours in New York.  Hiroyuki Kajitani, a Tokyo-based spokesman at Aozora,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
