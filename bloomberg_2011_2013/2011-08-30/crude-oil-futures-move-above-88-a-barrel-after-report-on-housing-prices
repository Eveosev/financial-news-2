Oil rose to the highest level in
almost four weeks in  New York , advancing with gasoline and
heating oil as East Coast refineries worked to restart after
Hurricane Irene and on signs the housing market is stabilizing.  Crude futures increased as gasoline jumped after Sunoco
Inc. shut a fuel-making unit at its Philadelphia refinery and
other terminals slowed rates. ConocoPhillips’s plant in Linden,
New Jersey, remains shut after Irene, according to the Energy
Department. The decline in  home prices  in June matched the
previous month, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index.  “We’re probably seeing the residual impact of Irene,”
said  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group Inc., an
energy advisory company in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “The
product markets are leading us higher. It’s the penultimate day
for trading the September gasoline contract, which you can
deliver summer-grade gasoline against.”  Crude for October delivery rose $1.63, or 1.9 percent, to
$88.90 a barrel, the highest settlement since Aug. 3 on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Futures have fallen 2.7 percent this
year.  Prices pared gains from the settlement after the industry-
funded  American Petroleum Institute  reported at 4:30 p.m. in
 Washington  that U.S. crude stockpiles increased 5.13 million
barrels to 352.2 million in the week ended Aug. 26, the biggest
one-week gain in oil supplies since March. October oil gained
$1.39, or 1.6 percent, to $88.66 a barrel in electronic trading
at 4:31 p.m.  Brent oil for October settlement gained $2.14, or 1.9
percent, to $114.02 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract was at a
premium of $25.12 to U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures,
compared with a record close of $26.21 on Aug. 19.  Refinery Outages  Sunoco’s 178,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Marcus Hook,
Pennsylvania, was operating at reduced rates, along with the
Philadelphia plant, according to the Energy Department’s
 situation report  from the Office of Electricity Delivery &
Energy Reliability at 10 a.m. New York time. In addition to the
shutdown of the 238,000-barrel-a-day Linden plant,
ConocoPhillips was running the 185,000-barrel-a-day refinery in
Trainer,  New Jersey , at reduced rates, the report showed.  Forecasters were also watching Tropical Storm Katia, which
was slowly strengthening over the eastern tropical Atlantic
Ocean as of 11 a.m. Miami time, had sustained winds of 45 miles
(72 kilometers) an hour. Katia is expected to become a
hurricane, with winds of 74 mph or more, by Sept. 1.  Gasoline for September delivery rose 8.94 cents, or 3.1
percent, to $2.9958 a gallon on the Nymex, the highest
settlement since Aug. 2. Prices have risen 55 percent in the
past year. September futures expire at the close of floor
trading tomorrow.  Heating oil for September delivery gained 5.9 cents, or 2
percent, to $3.0692 a gallon. Futures have risen for eight
consecutive days.  Force Majeure  Prices also increased after the CME Group Inc. declared
force majeure on August heating oil shipments into New York
because of Hurricane Irene, extending by five days the date to
make deliveries on the heating oil contract.  “The delivery facility that is scheduled to process these
deliveries was impacted this past weekend by weather associated
with Hurricane Irene,” CME said in a statement yesterday.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities
decreased at a slower pace in June, indicating the deterioration
is lessening. The index dropped 0.1 percent from the prior month
after adjustments for seasonal changes.  “We’ve had a couple of decent economic data points,” said
 John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based
hedge fund that focuses on energy. “Today’s housing numbers are
a little hopeful at least. I think that’s helping to support
prices.”  Consumer Confidence  Slips  U.S. consumer confidence tumbled to the lowest level since
April 2009 and European confidence fell the most since December
2008 in reports for August today from the Conference Board and
the European Commission in Brussels.  Earlier,  oil prices  fell as U.S. equities dropped for the
first time in three days and the euro weakened against the  U.S.
dollar , curbing commodities’ appeal as an alternative
investment.  An Energy Department report tomorrow may show U.S. crude
inventories declined 500,000 barrels last week, according to the
median of 13 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.
Supplies fell 2.21 million barrels, or 0.6 percent, to 351.8
million in the prior week.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 524,873
contracts as of 3:11 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 393,830
contracts yesterday, 42 percent below the average of the past
three months and the lowest level since April 29. Open interest
was 1.48 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
