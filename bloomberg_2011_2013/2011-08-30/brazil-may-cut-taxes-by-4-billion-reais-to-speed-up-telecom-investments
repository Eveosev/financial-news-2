Brazil ’s government may cut 4
billion reais ($2.5 billion) in taxes for companies building
fiber-optic networks to expand telephone, cable television and
Internet services, Communications Minister  Paulo Bernardo  said.  Bernardo, in an interview, said he will meet with Finance
Minister  Guido Mantega  today to discuss the possible tax cuts,
which are part of a plan to attract investment to Brazil’s
telecommunications market.   “It’s important to speed up investments,” Bernardo said
in an interview in Brasilia today. “I think it needs to start
in September.”  The tax cuts for the purchase of telecommunications
equipment could amount up to 4 billion reais by 2014, Bernardo
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
