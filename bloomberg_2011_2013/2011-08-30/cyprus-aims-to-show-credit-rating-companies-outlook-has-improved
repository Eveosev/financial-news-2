Cyprus is trying to convince rating
companies and investors that its financial prospects have
improved after the parliament approved austerity measures,
Finance Minister Kikis Kazamias said.  Companies assign a rating, “place a comma and then
afterward the outlook,” Kazamias told journalists in Nicosia
today. “My foremost concern is what follows that comma and to
see them change the negative outlook they have attributed us.”  Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings cut Cyprus’s credit rating amid concern the east
Mediterranean island will become the fourth European Union
nation to require a bailout.  The austerity measures were approved on Aug. 26 and will be
followed by a second package that will be presented to the
parliament on Sept. 15. The measures aim to cut the budget
deficit of the euro area’s third-smallest economy to below 2
percent of output in 2012 from 5.5 percent this year and to have
no shortfall in 2013, Kazamias said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
