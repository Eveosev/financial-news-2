Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  seeks
to force  Giants Stadium  LLC to produce documents related to its
role as partner in an interest-rate swap deal, according to a
court filing.  Giants Stadium, which financed about half of the
construction of the New Meadowlands Stadium with two 40-year
auction rate swaps from Lehman, had a $301.8 million claim on
bankrupt Lehman and its derivatives unit, according to filings.
Lehman said it would file some of the documents under seal to
protect confidential information, as the stadium company had
requested.  Lehman, which got a judge’s approval today for information
material explaining its $65 billion liquidation plan ahead of a
November vote, is still handling conflicts with major creditors.  Separately, Giants Stadium told a judge it wanted to
“participate” when the defunct firm deposed a former Lehman
executive, Robert Taylor, who negotiated the swap agreements.
The deposition is set for Sept. 27, it said.  Lehman, which has demanded 63,500 pages of documents from
Giants Stadium, told the company its lawyer could attend the
deposition, though not ask Taylor any questions, according to
the filing in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in  New York  today.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
