Russian Copper Co., the countryâ€™s
third-largest copper producer, raised reserves at its Tominskoye
copper deposit in the Chelyabinsk region by 80,000-100,000
metric tons after further exploration of the area.  The company will begin mining the deposit at Tominskoye,
with estimated reserves of 350 million tons, in 2015. The
operation will be capable of processing 28 million tons of ore a
year, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
