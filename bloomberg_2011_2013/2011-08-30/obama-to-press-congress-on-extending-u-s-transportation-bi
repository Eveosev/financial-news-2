President  Barack Obama , along with
labor and business leaders, will urge Congress to extend
legislation funding highways and mass transit projects before it
expires next month as a way to protect jobs, a White House
official said.  The president will be joined tomorrow at the White House by
David Chavern, chief operating officer for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, and AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka to press
lawmakers for an extension of the bill, which also authorizes
the federal 18.4 cent-per-gallon gas tax, the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity before the announcement.  The president will argue that the extension could protect
almost 1 million U.S. jobs and strengthen the nation’s
infrastructure, the official said.  Senator  Barbara Boxer , a California Democrat who heads the
Environment and Public Works Committee, has proposed a $109
billion, two-year extension of the act. It expires Sept. 30.  Obama next week plans to unveil his proposals to spur job
creation and economic growth, including more infrastructure
spending and tax incentives for businesses to hire. The nation’s
jobless rate held at 9.1 percent in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
