China ’s central bank will include
margin deposits in calculations of required reserves for banks
to “strengthen control of the reserve system,” according to a
People’s Bank of China document obtained by Bloomberg News.  The change will be implemented in three stages for large
banks, including Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.,
Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd., China
Construction Bank Corp. and Bank of Communications Co., starting
Sept. 5, the document says.  Chinese officials are seeking to control inflation and
credit risks after record lending fueled the nation’s recovery
from the global financial crisis. The reserve-ratio move is
intended to discourage banks from engaging in “excessive off-
balance sheet activities,”  Wang Tao , a Hong Kong-based
economist for UBS AG, said in a report today.  Smaller banks will make the change in six stages starting
from Sept. 15, according to the document dated Aug. 26. Foreign-
currency margin deposits must be included from Sept. 15, it said.
