Bunzl Plc (BNZL) , the world’s largest
distributor of disposable tableware and food packaging, climbed
the most in almost three years in London trading after first-
half earnings beat estimates.  The shares rose 57 pence, or 7.9 percent, to close at 779
pence at 4:30 p.m. It was the biggest increase since October
2008, and extended the gain this year to 8.3 percent.  Four analysts raised their recommendations on the stock to
“buy” and increased their estimates for 2011 earnings after
the London-based company said today first-half net income
advanced 16 percent to 80.6 million pounds ($131.4 million),
from 69.6 million pounds a year earlier.  “We are a very resilient business,” Chief Executive
Officer Michael Roney said in a telephone interview. “We feel
very confident that even if the world falls into recession we
should continue to deliver very good results.”  Bunzl announced the sale of its U.K. vending business to
Autobar U.K. Ltd. for 30 million pounds, which will result in a
55 million-pound loss this year. It is also buying a personal
protection equipment company based in the Netherlands and
completed the acquisition of a Canadian packaging business for
65 million pounds, Roney said.  Bunzl has spent 123 million pound on seven acquisitions so
far this year, compared with an average of 127 million pounds a
year since 2000, the CEO said.  Bunzl, which has raised its dividend every year since 1992,
lifted its interim payout by 13 percent to 8.05 pence a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
