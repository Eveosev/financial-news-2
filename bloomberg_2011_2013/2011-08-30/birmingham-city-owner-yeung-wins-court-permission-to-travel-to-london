Carson Yeung, the former hairdresser
who bought control of English soccer club Birmingham City in
2009 and is accused by  Hong Kong  police of  money laundering , won
permission from a judge to travel to  London  to meet with the
management of his club.  District Court Judge Stanley Chan granted Yeung’s request
to travel to London from Sept. 15 to Sept. 19 to speak with the
soccer club’s players and management, doubling the cash bail
Yeung must post while away to HK$8 million ($1 million).  Yeung, 51, had to surrender his travel documents as part of
the conditions of bail that was granted June 30. He was charged
with five counts of money laundering involving HK$721.3 million
($93 million). Jonathan Kwan, one of Yeung’s lawyers said at an
Aug. 11 hearing that the businessman is needed in the U.K.
because the period for player transfers ends at the end of the
month. No plea was entered today.  Clive Grossman, Yeung’s lawyer at today’s hearing, told
reporters outside court that his client denies all charges
against him. The next hearing is scheduled for Dec. 7.  Yeung was released in June after posting HK$4 million in
cash and HK$3 million in cash guarantees. Each charge he faces
is punishable by up to 14 years in jail and a fine of as much as
HK$5 million.  Birmingham was relegated from the Premier League last
season, three months after winning the League Cup, its first
major trophy in 48 years.  Birmingham, previously controlled by David and Ralph Gold
and  David Sullivan , was bought by Yeung in October 2009 in an
81.5 million-pound ($134 million) deal.  The case is Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and
Yeung Ka-sing Carson,  DCC 860/2011  in the Hong Kong District
Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
