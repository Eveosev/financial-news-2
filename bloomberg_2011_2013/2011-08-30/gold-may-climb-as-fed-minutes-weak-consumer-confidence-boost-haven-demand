Gold may decline in  New York  as
European equities rise for a third day, cutting demand for the
metal as an alternative investment.  Bullion advanced 2.1 percent yesterday after a statement
showed some Federal Reserve policy makers favored more
aggressive action to stimulate the economy during their Aug. 9
meeting and data showed  consumer confidence  slumped. European
equities climbed to the highest level in almost two weeks.  “We might see a dip on the back of profit-taking and
stronger equities,” Bernard Sin, head of currency and metal
trading at bullion refiner MKS Finance SA in Geneva, said by
phone today. Still, “physical demand is still fairly good.
Gold’s still a traditional safe haven and people may have no
other option than to buy gold if they don’t want exposure to
risk.”  Gold for December delivery was little changed at $1,830.20
an ounce by 8 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Futures are up 12
percent this month, the most since November 2009, and reached a
record $1,917.90 on Aug. 23. Immediate-delivery gold was 0.4
percent lower at $1,828.13 in  London .  Bullion is in the 11th year of a  bull market , the longest
winning streak since at least 1920 in London, as investors seek
to diversify away from equities and some currencies. The metal
is up 29 percent this year, outperforming global stocks,
commodities and Treasuries.  Minutes of the Fed meeting showed policy makers favored
“more substantial” measures to boost the  U.S. economy  than the
current pledge to hold rates at a record low for the next two
years. While Fed policy makers meeting this month didn’t
anticipate a recession, several said the recovery was “still
somewhat tentative” and was “vulnerable to adverse shocks.”  Consolidation Period  “It’s really just been a consolidation after the price ran
up to $1,900 so quickly,”  Gavin Wendt , director at Mine Life
Pty. in Sydney, said today by phone. “When you get those sorts
of price rises, it means that the metal or any commodity is ripe
for a period of some sort of consolidation, profit-taking first
then some consolidation. The overwhelming sentiment with respect
to gold is still positive.”  Exchange-traded-product holdings gained for the first time
in eight days, increasing 0.9 metric ton to 2,144.9 tons, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Assets reached a record 2,216.8 tons
on Aug. 8.  Colombia  increased its  gold reserves  by 2.3 tons to 9.16
tons in July, according to data on the International Monetary
Fund’s website.  Kazakhstan  cut reserves by 3.11 tons to 67.3
tons in the period,  Mexico  reduced its holdings by 0.175 tons
and Tajikistan lowered reserves by 1.19 tons, the data show.  Silver for December delivery in New York fell 0.4 percent
to $41.295 an ounce, cutting its gain to 3 percent this month.
Platinum for October delivery was little changed at $1,856.50 an
ounce and is up 4 percent this month. Palladium for December
delivery rose 0.6 percent to $783.95 an ounce. It’s down 5.3
percent in August.  To contact the reporters on this story:
