Vietnam ’s one-year bonds advanced
for the first time in four days on speculation last week’s
reduction in local fuel prices will help cool inflation. The
dong was stable.  The nation cut costs of oil products by as much as 2.3
percent on Aug. 26 after consumer-price gains quickened to 23.02
percent, the most since November 2008, according to government
data. The so-called 92-RON gasoline, the most commonly used
fuel, was cut to 20,800 dong ($1) a liter from 21,300 dong,
according to a statement on the government’s website.  “The recent fuel price cut will lower input costs in
industries, which in turn will help bring down prices and
inflation,” said Pham Minh Hoang, a fixed-income dealer at
Ocean Commercial Joint-Stock Bank in Hanoi. “Yields at auctions
will probably drop as banks will buy more bonds on expectation
interest rates will decline next year.”  The yield on the one-year note lost five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 12.27 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong was unchanged at 20,832 per dollar as of 4:30 p.m.
in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central
bank fixed the reference rate at 20,628, unchanged since Aug.
24, according to its website. The currency is allowed to trade
up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
