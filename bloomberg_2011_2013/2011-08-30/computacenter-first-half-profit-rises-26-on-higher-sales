Computacenter Plc (CCC) , which supplies
computer services to companies, said first-half profit rose 26
percent as sales growth in France and Germany offset weaker
performance in the U.K.  Net income was 19.9 million pounds ($32 million), up from
15.8 million pounds a year earlier, the Hatfield, England-based
company said in a statement distributed on the Regulatory News
Service. Revenue increased 5.9 percent to 1.37 billion pounds.  “We remain on track to achieve the board’s expectations
for 2011,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Norris said in the
statement.  Computacenter shares rose as much as 13.5 pence, or 3.7
percent, to 383 pence and closed up 1.2 percent at 374.1 pence
as of 4:30 p.m. in London trading, giving the company a market
value of 575.7 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
