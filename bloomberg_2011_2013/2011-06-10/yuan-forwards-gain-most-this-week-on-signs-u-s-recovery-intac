Yuan forwards gained for the first
time in three days on signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering,
alleviating concern that demand for  China ’s exports will flag.  Asian stocks advanced after reports showed the U.S. trade
deficit unexpectedly narrowed in April and U.S. consumer
confidence rose last week for the third consecutive time. The
yuan was little changed after China’s customs bureau reported a
$13.05 billion  trade surplus  in May, compared with $11.4 billion
in April and the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
23 economists for $19.3 billion.  “The NDF is lifted by improved sentiment on the latest,
more encouraging U.S. data,” said Daniel Chan, chief economist
at BWC Capital Markets in Hong Kong. “The expectation that
China will continue with gradual appreciation also supports the
offshore market rates.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.05 percent
to 6.3915 per dollar as of 11:11 a.m. in  Hong Kong , limiting its
weekly loss to 0.4 percent. The contracts were at a 1.4 percent
premium to the onshore spot rate, the smallest gap since Sept.
16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s reference rate
0.04 percent weaker at 6.4853 per dollar. The yuan isn’t allowed
to move more than 0.5 percent on either side of the daily
fixing.  The yuan slipped 0.03 percent to 6.4780 per dollar in
 Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The currency reached 6.4755 on June 8, the strongest level since
China unified official and market exchange rates at the end of
1993. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan was little
changed at 6.4805.  To contact the reporter on this story:
