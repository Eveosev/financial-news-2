R.K. Gupta, managing director at
Taurus Asset Management Ltd., comments from Mumbai on the impact
of industrial output data on Indian equities.  India ’s industrial production growth eased in April, a
slowdown that has yet to curb pressure on the  Reserve Bank  of
India to raise  interest rates  to damp inflation.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. fell for a third day, dropping 0.5 percent. The gauge
slid 3.3 percent in May, the most since January.  On industrial production:  “Lower-than-expected production may prevent the central
bank increasing interest rates in its policy meeting next week
if the government has to achieve its objective of 8 percent GDP
growth. The central bank may compromise on its fight against
inflation to protect growth. The April IIP figure is less
significant as most companies bunch up their sales and
production in March for year-end accounting purposes.”  On market outlook:  “Stocks are likely to trade in a narrow range of 5,400 to
5,600 till the middle of July, when first-quarter corporate
earnings start coming out. We are advising clients to avoid
steel, oil and power stocks. Steel companies should be avoided
as  iron ore , coal and labor costs have gone up. Oil firms,
including oil marketing companies, should be sold as the
government is likely to increase the subsidy burden on these
companies on lower tax collections. Power firms should be
avoided as merchant power rates have declined drastically.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
