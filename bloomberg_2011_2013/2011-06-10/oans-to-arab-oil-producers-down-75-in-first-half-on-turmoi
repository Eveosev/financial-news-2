The amount of loans to energy
projects in Arab oil-producing countries has declined 75 percent
so far this year, mostly because of political turmoil, according
to an investment bank owned by Arab governments.  Nine deals have been signed and one closed in 2011,
amounting to $4.6 billion, compared with 11 deals worth $18.5
billion in the same period last year,  Arab Petroleum Investments
Corp.  said in an e-mailed report today.  The Dammam, Saudi Arabia-based bank, known as Apicorp, is
the investment banking arm of the  Organization of Arab Petroleum
Exporting Countries .  Arab oil producers need $41 billion to $53 billion a year
between 2011 and 2015 to carry on with their energy projects,
depending on the rate at which shelved or postponed plans will
be brought back for financing, the bank said.  Apicorp said that because of political risk and high
borrowing costs, “a significant financing gap, which is likely
to be part of a broader contraction in the region’s loan market,
seems certain to occur.”  Only five Arab countries remain in the loan market, Apicorp
said. They are the  United Arab Emirates ,  Saudi Arabia , Qatar,
Oman and, to a very small degree, Jordan, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
