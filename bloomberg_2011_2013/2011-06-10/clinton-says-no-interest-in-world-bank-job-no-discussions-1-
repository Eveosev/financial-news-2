Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
said she has no interest in becoming president of the World
Bank.  Clinton said that, contrary to a Reuters report yesterday,
she has had no discussions about the job.  “I am not pursuing that position,” she told reporters in
Lusaka, Zambia. “It’s a very important institution and
obviously we want to see the World Bank well led. We work
closely with the World Bank but I am absolutely dedicated to my
service as secretary of state.”  Clinton arrived today in Zambia, the first U.S. secretary
of state to visit the country since  Henry Kissinger  in 1976, to
discuss an 11-year-old trade agreement with 37 African nations.  Clinton will encourage the nations to reduce their
dependence on oil and to make more use of the duty-free
agreement to expand exports in other areas besides oil.  In 1976, Kissinger delivered a speech in Lusaka about U.S.
policy in the  South Africa , calling the colonial era a “thing
of the past.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
