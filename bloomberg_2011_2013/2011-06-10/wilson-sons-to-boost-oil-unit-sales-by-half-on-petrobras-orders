Wilson Sons Ltd. (WSON11) , South America’s
largest tugboat operator, plans to boost sales from its oil and
gas unit by about half over the next six years as it expands its
fleet, Chief Financial Officer Felipe Gutterres said.  The company is tripling the number of oil service vessels
to 34 by 2017 as it targets orders from  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,
Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, Gutterres said in an
interview. Petrobras is spending about $40 billion a year to
double output over the next decade.  “We will be able to serve the dramatic demand for new
vessels that the market needs,” Gutterres said in Rio de
Janeiro. “We also serve other international  oil companies .”  The Rio de Janeiro-based logistics company currently gets
30 percent of revenues from transporting equipment and supplies
to and from offshore oil installations, Gutterres said.  About 79 percent of the company’s $1.8 billion spending in
its seven-year business plan will come from  Brazil ’s Merchant
Marine Fund, a state agency that lends to the industry, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
