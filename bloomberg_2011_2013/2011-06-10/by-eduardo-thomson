Chile ’s peso fell as a decline in
the price of copper, the nation’s largest export, and the euro
cut demand for riskier emerging-market assets.  The peso weakened 0.4 percent to 468.45 per dollar at 10:04
a.m. New York time, from 466.61 yesterday. The currency is
headed to a weekly loss of 0.1 percent, its third straight week
of declines.  “Things still look bad outside,” Ronald Volpi, head of
spot currency trading at Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA,
said in an interview from Santiago. “Copper prices are
falling.”  The euro fell as much as 0.8 percent to $1.4397, its third
day of losses, after European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled a slowing pace of interest-rate increases this
year. Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, fell
as much as 1.6 percent in  New York  to $4.0430 a pound, its third
day of losses, on signs of a decline of imports into  China  in
May. China is the world’s largest consumer of the metal.  Chile’s central bank will raise its benchmark rate to 5.25
percent on June 14 from 5 percent, after increasing lending
costs by a half-point at its past three meetings, according to
the bank’s monthly survey of economists.  The same survey showed economists forecast the peso to
trade at 470 per dollar in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
