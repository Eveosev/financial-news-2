Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  said it’s boosting
capital with earnings and cutting risky assets to meet all new
regulatory requirements including a potential levy for financial
companies deemed systemically relevant.  Germany ’s biggest bank is “confident” it will meet Basel
III capital and liquidity requirements early, Chief Risk Officer
Hugo Banziger said in a  presentation  today. Lenders may be
expected to hold as much as 12 percent in core Tier 1 capital by
2019 if you add potential market expectations, surcharges for
systemically important banks and countercyclical buffers to the
7 percent minimum requirement, according to one of the
presentation slides.  Global regulators are overhauling bank capital and
liquidity requirements after existing rules, known as  Basel II ,
failed to protect lenders from insolvency and taxpayer-funded
bailouts in 2008 and 2009. Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, which
didn’t need German state aid, had a core Tier 1 capital ratio, a
measure of financial strength that excludes certain hybrid
instruments, of 9.6 percent at the end of March.  The lender has “the potential” to raise additional
capital through contingent convertible bonds, or CoCos, Banziger
said in the presentation today. CoCos automatically become
equity when capital falls below preset levels and Swiss
competitors such as Credit Suisse Group AG sold the bonds this
year to strengthen their finances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
