Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  Chief
Executive Officer  Peter Voser  said global demand for fresh water
may outstrip supply by 40 percent in 20 years.  Shell, together with the International Energy Agency and
 World Business Council for Sustainable Development , is
conducting research on water use in the energy industry, Voser
said yesterday in London. The Hague-based company has begun
using water recycling technologies at its ventures in Brazil and
other operations.  “Today’s water solutions use energy and increase CO2
emissions,” Voser said in the  speech  posted on Shell’s website.
“So the challenge will be to develop technologies that can
reduce both water use and CO2 emissions.”  Some Middle Eastern nations use 65 percent of oil consumed
at home to run desalination plants to produce fresh water, Voser
said. At the same time, the process is making the Persian Gulf
saltier.  “ NASA  has pointed out, ocean salinity could have
disturbing effects on ocean circulation and climate change over
time,” Voser said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
