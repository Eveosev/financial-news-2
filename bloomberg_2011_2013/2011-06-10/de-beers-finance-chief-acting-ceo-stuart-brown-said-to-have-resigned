De Beers , a unit of  Anglo American
Plc (AAL) , said Chief Financial Officer Stuart Brown resigned just a
month after the world’s largest diamond producer broke with
tradition to appoint an outsider as its new chief executive.  Brown, who joined De Beers in 1992, will leave the company
on July 31 after helping Alstom SA’s Philippe Mellier settle in
as CEO, the gem producer said in an e-mailed  statement  today.
The finance chief, who has also been acting joint-CEO since last
year, is seeking “new challenges,” he said in the statement.  De Beers, producer of about 40 percent of the world’s rough
diamonds, said May 16 that it chose Mellier to head the company
rather than promote internally. Mellier, a mechanical engineer
with a background in cars and trains, will join the
Johannesburg-based miner next month.  Anglo owns 45 percent of De Beers, while the Oppenheimer
family owns 40 percent and Botswana holds 15 percent. Shares in
Anglo fell as much as 3.1 percent, the most in almost three
weeks, and traded down 2.9 percent at 2,901 pence as of 3:36
p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
