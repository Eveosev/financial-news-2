South Korea  will take more steps if
needed to better cope with sudden changes in capital flowing in
and out of the country, Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo
said, without elaborating.  Kim also said the central bank needs to manage its $300
billion foreign-exchange reserves “efficiently,” and called for
closer monitoring of the financial and currency markets. He
spoke in a speech today in  Seoul  to mark the 61st anniversary of
the Bank of Korea’s founding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
