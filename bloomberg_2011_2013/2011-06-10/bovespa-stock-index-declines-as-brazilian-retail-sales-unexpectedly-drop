The Bovespa stock index fell,
sending the benchmark to its largest weekly decline in a month,
as commodities dropped and  Brazil ’s retail sales unexpectedly
retreated in April, adding to signs that the global economy is
slowing.  Braskem SA, Latin America’s largest petrochemicals maker,
fell the most in six weeks as crude prices tumbled. Vale SA, the
world’s second-largest miner, retreated as metals prices
dropped. Brazil’s largest online retailer, B2W Cia. Global do
Varejo, dropped after Brazil’s Justice Ministry requested
information on delays in product deliveries from Americanas.com,
the company’s online retailer.  The Bovespa slipped 1.2 percent to 62,697.16 at 4 p.m. New
York time. The index fell 2.5 percent for the week, its largest
decline since the five days ended June 3. Fifty-nine stocks
declined while six rose. The real weakened 0.9 percent to 1.5973
per  U.S. dollar , from 1.5832 yesterday.  “The market is clearly pricing in a rhythm of slower
economic activity,” said Jaime Valdivia, who helps manage about
$1.4 billion of emerging-market assets at Bluecrest Capital
Management in New York. “We’re going through a soft patch of
global economic activity, in the U.S.,  Europe  and  China , and
soft retail sales in Brazil aren’t a big surprise.”  April’s contraction in retail sales surprised 26 of 30
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, whose median estimate was for
0.4 percent growth in April. Sales rose 10 percent from the
prior year, the agency said.  PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos & Participacoes, Brazil’s
biggest homebuilder, fell 2.5 percent to 9.48 reais. Brookfield
Incorporacoes SA dropped 3.2 percent to 8.30 reais.  B2W, Marfrig  B2W fell 2.7 percent to 21.50 reais after earlier dropping
as much as 3.9 percent. Marfrig Alimentos SA,  Latin America ’s
second-largest beef producer, lost 1.4 percent to 13.95 reais.  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA, Brazil’s biggest airline
by market value, retreated 1.3 percent to 18.85 reais while Tam
SA, Brazil’s second-biggest airline, dropped 2.8 percent to
32.16 reais.  Crude oil for July delivery fell 3 percent to $98.85 a
barrel. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI Index of 26 raw materials slid
0.7 percent.  Braskem fell 3.3 percent, the most since May 2, to 23.37
reais. Vale dropped 0.9 percent to 44.06 reais.  After gaining speed in the first quarter, when gross
domestic product expanded 1.3 percent from the previous three-
month period, Brazil’s economy has shown signs of slowing.  Industrial Production   Industrial production slumped 2.1 percent in April from
March, the biggest contraction since 2008, and  consumer
confidence  fell in May to its lowest level in more than a year.
Average real wages fell 1.8 percent in April from March.  “The economy isn’t turning south, but rather it’s an
adjustment to government monetary measures and a sharp
correction globally for growth,” Valdivia said.  U.S. stocks extended a sixth weekly drop today, the longest
slump for the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  since 2002, amid
concern the global economy is slowing. China reported a smaller-
than-estimated  trade surplus  today as export growth dimmed,
while U.K. manufacturing slowed more than economists forecast.  The Bovespa has fallen 14 percent from a November high on
concern accelerating inflation will hurt economic growth. The
index trades at 10 times analysts’ earnings estimates, near the
lowest since March 2009, according to weekly data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of 12.5 for the Shanghai
Composite Index, 6.7 for  Russia ’s Micex and 14.8 for  India ’s
Sensex.  Investors poured 2.9 billion reais ($1.8 billion) into
Latin America’s biggest equity market in May, after pulling 4.07
billion reais in the preceding three months, data from the Sao
Paulo exchange show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
