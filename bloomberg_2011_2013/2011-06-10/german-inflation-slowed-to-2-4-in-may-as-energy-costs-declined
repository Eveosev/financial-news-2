Inflation in  Germany , Europe’s
largest economy, slowed in May after energy costs retreated.  The inflation rate, calculated using a harmonized European
Union method, dropped to 2.4 percent from 2.7 percent in April,
the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today,
confirming its first estimate published May 27. From April,
consumer prices declined 0.2 percent.  Oil prices  dropped 10 percent in May after breaching $114 a
barrel in April. European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled yesterday the bank is ready to raise borrowing
costs next month to curb price pressures after keeping the
benchmark interest rate at 1.25 percent, even as peripheral
nations such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland remain mired in a
sovereign-debt crisis.  “Inflation still has room to rise,” said  Joerg Lueschow ,
an economist at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf. “We should pass the
highpoint in the summer months. After that, price pressures
should ease, but German inflation will probably stay above 2
percent next year and give the ECB reason to hit the brake.”  On a non-harmonized basis, inflation eased to 2.3 percent
in May from 2.4 percent in April and consumer prices were
unchanged in the month, the statistics office said. Wholesale
prices, which were also flat in the month, gained 8.9 percent
from a year earlier, the statistics office said in a separate
release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
