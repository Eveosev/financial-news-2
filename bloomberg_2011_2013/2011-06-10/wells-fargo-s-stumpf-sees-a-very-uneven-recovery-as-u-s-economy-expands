The  U.S. economy  is growing unevenly
and regulators should avoid setting new capital standards so
high that they stifle lending, according to the head of  Wells
Fargo & Co. (WFC)   “This has been a very difficult downturn,” said John G. Stumpf, chief executive officer of Wells Fargo, during a speech
today in  San Francisco , where the company is based. “The
economy is recovering, it is true,” he said, “but growth is
very uneven.”  Regulators are deciding whether to impose higher capital
cushions on the biggest lenders to avert a repeat of the 2008
financial crisis. Bankers including  Jamie Dimon , CEO of JPMorgan
Chase & Co., have said regulators risk slowing the recovery if
they rein in banks too tightly.  “There are some who would suggest more capital is
better,” Stumpf said during the 25th Annual Conference of 100
Black Men of America Inc. That’s not necessarily the case, he
said, urging “the right amount of capital” to allow room for
lending. Wells Fargo is the biggest U.S. home lender and the
fourth-largest bank by assets.  “We want to be in a position to make lots of loans, to
help small businesses grow,” Stumpf said.  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman  Sheila Bair 
defended higher capital buffers for the biggest banks yesterday
and said U.S. regulators must guard against pressure to be less
vigilant in overseeing the financial industry as the nation
recovers from the credit crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
