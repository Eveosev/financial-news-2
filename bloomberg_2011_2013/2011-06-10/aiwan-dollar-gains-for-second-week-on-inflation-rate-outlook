(Corrects March bid-cover ratio in fifth paragraph.)  Taiwan ’s benchmark 10-year bonds
fell, capping the worst week since 2008, on speculation the
central bank will raise  interest rates  this month to quell
inflation. The island’s currency fell.  Yields jumped to a five-month high after demand waned at an
auction for the securities on June 7. A government report on the
same day showed inflation accelerated to a 15-month high of 1.66
percent in May. The central bank may lift the policy rate at its
next meeting on June 30, after the  Bank of Korea  raised its
benchmark rate today, according to  Albert Lee , a bond trader at
Cathay United Bank Co. Ltd.  “The market is concerned about more policy tightening,
especially after the latest move in  Korea ,” said Lee, who is
based in Taipei. “Ten-year yields could test the previous high
because of the inflation pressure.”  The yield on the 1.375 percent note due March 2021 climbed
10.5 basis points, or 0.105 percentage point, this week to 1.53
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the
biggest jump for a benchmark 10-year note since September 2008.
The rate hit 1.61 percent on Dec. 29, its highest since July
2009, and Lee said it may revisit the level this month.  The government sold NT$40 billion ($1.4 billion) of 2021
securities at an auction on June 7 to yield 1.475 percent,
compared with 1.381 percent at the previous sale in March.
Demand exceeded the amount offered by 1.26 times, weaker than
1.71 times in March.  Taiwan’s central bank will probably raise its discount rate
on 10-day loans to banks by 0.125 percentage point to 1.875
percent later this month, according to Wen-yen Fang, an
economist at KGI Securities Co. in Taipei. Policy makers lifted
the rate by the same margin in each of the past four meetings
since July 2010.  Rate Outlook  “Inflationary pressure will continue to increase into the
second half as producers pass on costs to consumers,” said
KGI’s Fang. “That’s one reason why the  Taiwan dollar  has been
stronger as it helps keep down import costs.”  The local dollar has strengthened 5.3 percent this year to
NT$28.835 against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It slipped 0.3 percent from a week ago amid concern
economic slowdowns in the U.S. and  China  will hurt exports.  The local currency will reach NT$28.30 against its U.S.
counterpart by the end of the year, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
