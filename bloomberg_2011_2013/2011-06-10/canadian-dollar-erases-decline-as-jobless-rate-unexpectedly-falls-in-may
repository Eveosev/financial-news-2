Canada ’s dollar fell against its
U.S. counterpart on concern the global economy is slowing, even
as a government report showed Canada’s jobless rate unexpectedly
fell in May to the lowest level since January 2009.  The loonie, as the currency is known for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, also dropped as oil, Canada’s
biggest export, and stocks fell.  “Even though the number this morning was a little bit
stronger, especially in the full-time component, I don’t think
it changes what’s going on as far as everything else,” said
 David Love , a trader of interest-rate derivatives at Le Groupe
Jitney Inc. in  Montreal . “All our eyes are on the U.S. and
what’s going on in  Europe .”  The loonie depreciated 0.7 percent to 97.99 cents versus
the U.S. currency at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from 97.30 cents
yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0205.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.4 percent after
adding 0.7 percent yesterday, its first gain after six
consecutive days of losses. Crude oil for July delivery
decreased 3 percent to $98.85 a barrel in  New York  after rising
1.2 percent yesterday.  “Canada’s ties to commodities certainly point to a weaker
loonie, despite the stronger employment number this morning,”
said  Dean Popplewell , an analyst at the online currency-trading
firm Oanda Corp. in Toronto.  Cross Trades  Among its most-traded counterparts, the Canadian dollar
fell the most against the yen, dropping 0.8 percent. The loonie
gained against the euro for a third consecutive day, advancing
0.4 percent to C$1.4059.  The loonie strengthened earlier today after a Statistics
Canada report showed the nation’s unemployment rate fell to 7.4
percent last month from 7.6 percent in April.  Employers added 22,300 jobs last month after an increase of
58,300 in April. The median forecast of 27 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a gain of 20,000.  “From the economic side, I’m not seeing this as a huge
jump, but it definitely is positive,” said C.J. Gavsie,
managing director for foreign-exchange sales at Bank of
Montreal’s BMO Capital Markets unit in Toronto.  Government bonds  rose, pushing the yield on the 10-year
benchmark security down three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 3 percent. The 3.25 percent note that expires in June
2021 added 25 cents to C$102.10.  Bank of Canada   The loonie rallied on May 31, when the Bank of Canada added
language about a potential increase in borrowing costs for the
first time since September, saying it will raise rates
“eventually” as the economy recovers.  The target for overnight loans between commercial banks
remained at 1 percent, where it has been since September. The
U.S., to which Canada ships about 75 percent of its exports,
hasn’t changed rates since December 2008.  “The domestic side of the Canadian economy just doesn’t
need emergency low interest rates, which is not something you
can say with the U.S.,” said  David Watt , senior currency
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit in
Toronto. “The U.S. is our largest trading partner, and that’s
probably one of the reasons why the Bank of Canada hasn’t raised
the rates more.”  The loonie fell against the greenback on June 3 after U.S.
Labor Department figures showed payrolls increased by 54,000
jobs in May after the addition of 232,000 in the previous month.
The U.S. unemployment rate increased to 9.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
