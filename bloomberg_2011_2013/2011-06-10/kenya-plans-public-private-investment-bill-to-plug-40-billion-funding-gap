Kenya  is drafting a law to attract
private investment as it seeks to cover a $40 billion financing
gap in a plan to expand road and rail links and boost
electricity generation, a Treasury official said.  The proposed Public-Private Partnerships Bill defines rules
on how companies can invest to build and operate public
projects, aimed at luring funds to step up infrastructure
development, Stanley Kamau, a director at Kenya’s  Finance
Ministry , said at a conference today in the capital, Nairobi.  Kenya’s so-called  Vision 2030  plan puts developing
infrastructure at the center of a blueprint to raise economic
growth to 10 percent annually by 2012 and sustain that rate
through 2030. Expansion is expected to slow to 5.3 percent this
year, from 5.6 percent in 2010, as drought cuts agricultural
output, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said on June 8.  Kenya has acquired consultants to compile by the end of
September a list of the top five proposed public-private
projects to pursue, Vincent Rague, a financial adviser in the
Finance Ministry, said at the same conference.  The legislation is meant to supersede a collection of laws
that now govern public-private projects, including the Kenya
Railways concession and the 90-megawatt Rabai power plant,
according to a government statement handed to reporters today.  “The current PPP regulations are not comprehensive enough
in providing legal certainty to investors,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
