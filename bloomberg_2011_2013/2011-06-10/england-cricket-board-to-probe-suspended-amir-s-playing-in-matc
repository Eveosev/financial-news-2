The  England  and Wales Cricket Board
will open an investigation into suspended Pakistan bowler
Mohammed Amir playing in a lower-level game.  Amir, 19, was banned for five years by the  International
Cricket Council  in February for match-tampering in a Test
against England last year. He played for Addington 1743 Cricket
Club in a Surrey Cricket League game against St. Luke’s on June
4, taking four wickets in seven overs and scoring 60, according
to the team’s website.  The England Board said in a statement it’s asked the Surrey
Cricket Board to assist in its probe and is also seeking a full
written explanation from Addington 1743 of the events leading to
Amir’s appearance. The England Board said it will also continue
to help the ICC in its inquiry into the matter.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
