Sri Lanka ’s inflation will ease over
time and the nation’s monetary conditions support faster
economic expansion, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  Foreign investment in Sri Lanka are still below
expectations and the South Asian nation needs more funds from
abroad to sustain growth, Brian Aitken, the IMF’s mission chief
for Sri Lanka, said in Colombo today.  The  Central Bank of Sri Lanka  hasn’t raised  interest rates 
since 2007, judging that rising food supplies and currency gains
will help cool inflation. Sri Lanka is aiming to accelerate
growth to 8.5 percent this year from 8 percent in 2010.  Inflation in the nation slowed to 8.8 percent in May,
easing for the first time in four months. The IMF expects the
inflation rate to fall to about 7 percent, Aitken said.  The IMF, which in April disbursed $218.3 million to Sri
Lanka as part of a $2.62 billion loan, will release semi-annual
reviews of the economy instead of quarterly reports that it
currently publishes, Aitken said.  The IMF said strong import growth and higher crude  oil
prices  may strain Sri Lanka’s balance of payments and reiterated
that the nation’s exchange rate be made more flexible.  The Sri Lankan rupee has gained 1.3 percent since Jan. 1
and closed at 109.5 against the dollar today. The Colombo All-
Share Index fell 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
