Gold may gain for a second day in
New York as concern about  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis and
slowing economic growth spur demand for the metal as an
alternative investment.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
rejected any direct ECB participation in a second bailout for
 Greece , escalating a clash with governments as they rush to
craft a solution involving investors. The U.S. Federal Reserve
this week said the economy expanded at a “steady pace” in most
of the country while slowing in four of 12 regions, underscoring
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s statement that record stimulus should
be maintained to bolster a “frustratingly slow” recovery.  Gold will be “supported if the European debt crisis
stumbles along without a solid solution,”  Edel Tully , a London-
based analyst at UBS AG, said today in a report. “Weakness in
global data is fostering more optimism on gold in the second
half. There’s the threat that real  interest rates  might remain
entrenched in negative territory across many regions.”  Gold for August delivery fell 60 cents to $1,542.10 an
ounce by 7:59 a.m. on the Comex in New York. The metal is little
changed this week. Immediate-delivery gold was 0.2 percent lower
at $1,541.55 in London.  Trichet signaled yesterday that the ECB will press ahead
with another interest-rate increase next month to tame euro-area
inflation, even as Greece remains on the brink of default. The
costs of insuring against default on government debt sold by
Greece,  Portugal  and Ireland have surged to records, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  British Pounds Record  Gold is up 8.5 percent in 2011 after climbing the past 10
years, the longest run of gains in at least nine decades in
 London . Europe’s debt crisis helped bullion futures reach a
record $1,577.40 on May 2. The metal touched an all-time high of
950.81 British pounds today.  “We shall recommend buying gold in euro, sterling and yen
terms immediately,” economist  Dennis Gartman  wrote in his
Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter. “We are about to turn
violently bullish of the dollar,” said Gartman, adding that he
is buying gold primarily in euros and pounds today.  UBS raised its three-month gold forecast to $1,600 from
$1,400, while cutting its one-month forecast to $1,475 from
$1,500. There may be a “pullback over the summer months,”
though any drops “will be short-lived,” Tully said.  Silver for July delivery fell 0.3 percent to $37.32 an
ounce in  New York . Palladium for September delivery declined 0.4
percent to $814.80 an ounce. Platinum for July delivery was down
0.5 percent at $1,836 an ounce after climbing to a five-week
high of $1,849.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
