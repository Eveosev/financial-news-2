Indian stocks dropped, extending the
benchmark index’s third weekly loss in four, after a report
showed factory output growth eased in April, a slowdown that may
not stop the central bank from raise rates next week.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the country’s biggest engineering
company, lost 1.9 percent, the most since May 25. Output at
plants, utilities and mines rose 6.3 percent from a year earlier
after an 8.8 percent gain in March, the government said today,
after it changed the base year to 2004-05.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the
nation’s largest private lender, paced declines among peers,
falling 1.3 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index lost 131.75, or
0.7 percent, to 18,253.15, according to preliminary closing
prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The gauge extended losses after
the factory output report and is down 0.7 percent for the week.
The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of India
Ltd. declined 0.7 percent to 5,484.60. The BSE 200 Index slid
0.7 percent to 2,270.12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
