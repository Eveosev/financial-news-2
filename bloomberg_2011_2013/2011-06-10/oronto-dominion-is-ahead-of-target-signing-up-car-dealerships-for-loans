Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,  Canada ’s
second-largest bank, said its new auto-lending unit is about 25
percent ahead of targets for signing agreements with U.S. car
dealers.  Toronto-Dominion acquired Chrysler Financial Corp. for
about $6.3 billion in April and planned on having about 5,000
dealers in its network.  “In the last 70 days, we’ve been able to sign up about 25
percent more dealers than just the 5,000,” TD Auto Finance
President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas Gilman said today
in a telephone interview.  Toronto-Dominion has said it wants to become a top 10 auto
lender in the U.S. within three to four years, with assets of
about $20 billion to $30 billion. Demand for car financing has
accelerated after U.S. consumer borrowing rose in April for a
seventh consecutive month, according to the  Federal Reserve .  TD Auto Finance  has also taken over financing agreements
the parent company already had with about 4,000 dealers in
Canada.  “I think the industry in Canada will grow at a slower rate
than in the  United States ,” Gilman said. “The industry up
there didn’t have the recessionary hit as great as the U.S. did,
so the ability to grow back to prior levels isn’t nearly as
strong as it is in the United States.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
