European coal derivatives advanced
in early London trading and headed for a second weekly gain.  Coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp with
settlement next year rose 25 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $131 a
metric ton by 10:27 a.m. in the U.K. capital. A close at that
level would be a 1.7 percent increase for the week.  The data are drawn from information supplied by ICAP Plc,
