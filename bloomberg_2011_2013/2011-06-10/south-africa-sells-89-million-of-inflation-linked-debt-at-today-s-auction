South Africa sold 600 million rand
($89 million) of inflation-linked bonds amid speculation the
central bank won’t raise  interest rates  to slow price increases
driven by food and fuel costs.  The Reserve Bank auctioned 225 million rand of 2.75 percent
securities maturing in 2022 at a yield of 2.52 percent,
unchanged from the previous auction on June 3, according to the
central bank’s data on Bloomberg. Investors bid for 2.2 times
the amount allocated, it said. The bank also sold 375 million
rand of 3.45 percent bonds due 2033 at a yield of 2.5 percent,
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, lower than on June 3.
Investors bid for 1.6 times the amount allocated. The bank
didn’t accept any bids for its 2.6 percent notes due 2028.  Price increases in  South Africa  are driven mostly by
“cost-push” factors such as international food and oil prices,
which are beyond the effect of local monetary policy, Deputy
Governor  Daniel Mminele  said on May 27. The consumer inflation
rate rose to 4.2 percent in April, from 4.1 percent the month
before.  “The MPC generally views the economic recovery as hesitant
and the rise in inflation as temporary, caused by earlier spikes
in global food and oil prices”, Nicky Weimar and Dennis Dykes,
economists at Johannesburg-based Nedbank Group Ltd., said in a
research note. “Consequently, the MPC will wait for more
generalized inflationary pressures to emerge before tightening
monetary policy.”  Breakeven Rate  The 10-year breakeven rate, or yield difference between
inflation-linked bonds and fixed-interest securities of similar
maturity, which gives an indication of bond investors’ outlook
for inflation, has climbed nine basis points in the past four
days to 5.73 percent. The  Reserve Bank  said in May it expects
inflation to breach the 6 percent target in the first quarter of
2012.  Inflation-linked bonds, which pay interest based on a
capital amount linked to the  consumer price index , return more
than fixed-interest bonds when the average inflation rate is
above the breakeven rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
