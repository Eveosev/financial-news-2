French industrial output dropped for
a second month in April as a cooling global expansion slowed
demand at home and abroad.  Output from factories, mines and utilities fell 0.3 percent
from March, when it declined a revised 1.1 percent, statistics
office Insee said today. Economists forecast a 0.4 percent gain,
according to the median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Reports on jobs and manufacturing suggest the  U.S. economy 
isn’t recovering as fast as forecast, indicating demand for
French exports may be ebbing at a time when  consumer spending  in
 France  is also dropping. Confidence among French manufacturers
fell for a second month in May, prompting the Bank of France to
cut its second-quarter growth forecast yesterday to 0.4 percent
from 0.5 percent.  “None of the news is very encouraging,” said  Dominique Barbet , an economist at BNP Paribas in Paris. “People are
realizing there is a bit of a global slowdown.”  The Bank of France’s Business Sentiment Indicator for
manufacturers fell to 103 in May from a revised 106 in April,
the central bank said yesterday.  In the U.S., initial jobless claims unexpectedly rose last
week, the Labor Department said yesterday in a sign the labor
market is struggling to gain traction. U.S. manufacturing grew
at the slowest pace in more than a year in May, according to
Institute for Supply Management data released last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
