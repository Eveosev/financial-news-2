     June 10 (Bloomberg.com) -- This is not a good sign for the
Groupon IPO — more stock-floggers needed:
Groupon Inc., seeking to raise $750 million in an initial public
offering, asked six more banks to help underwrite the sale,
including Barclays Plc (BARC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM),
said two people with knowledge of the situation.  Citigroup Inc. (C), Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and Allen & Co. were also offered a role, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the decision isn’t
public. Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) are leading the IPO, a June 2
filing said.  More here.  Click here  to see the story as it appeared on Bloomberg.com.
