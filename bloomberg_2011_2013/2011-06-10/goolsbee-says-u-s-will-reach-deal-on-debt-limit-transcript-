Austan Goolsbee , chairman of the
White House Council of Economic Advisers, in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,”
airing this weekend, said he is confident that the
administration and Congress will reach a deal to raise the
federal debt limit and that markets are confident that the U.S.
won’t default.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

Julianna Goldman, in for Al Hunt this week. We begin the show
with Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the White House Council of
Economic Advisers.  Austan, thanks for joining us.  AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, PRESIDENT’S COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS:
Thanks for having me, Julianna.  GOLDMAN: You see the reports. Unemployment is up,
confidence is down, manufacturing has slowed and housing prices
are at their lowest since 2003. This is a pretty lousy economy,
isn’t it?  GOOLSBEE: Well, look, Julianna, the thing is, we know that
there were some - as you say - some headwinds that, in the first
of the year. I would point to the gas prices or the tragic
events in  Japan  and the impact they had on manufacturing and
some of the European stuff. But many of those private
forecasters and the Fed, you’ve seen, do not - they anticipate
that there would be some rebound in the second half of the year.  I think it’s important to take stock of where we came from.
Clearly, we’re coming out of worst hole since 1929, where we’re
losing hundreds of thousands - three-quarters of a million jobs
per month. And now in the last six months, we’ve added a million
jobs.  We’ve got to get the growth rate higher. The president’s
the first to say that. But I don’t think we should - I don’t
think we should dismiss the progress that we made from coming
out of that hole, which is where it sounded like you were going.  GOLDMAN: But even so, are you concerned that the current
debate now in  Washington  around debt and deficits, that that’s
overshadowing the need for some sort of additional measures that
could provide some short-term economic boost?  GOOLSBEE: I would say that I am concerned if, in the
discussions about long-range deficit reduction, which we should
have, that we, over the long run, we’ve got to start living
within our means - these fiscal issues we’ve known about for 40
years, and now it does feel like there’s a moment when maybe we
could confront them - I would be concerned if, in that
discussion, we’re going to go skimp on the growth strategy,
we’re going to cut spending on education and training -  GOLDMAN: What about short-term, short-term measures?  GOOLSBEE: - That’s - in the short term, if we cut education
and training, if we cut R&D and innovation spending, if we’re
cutting the kinds of investments that we need to make for us to
grow, we’re making a mistake.  I think - if you’re asking the argument, should there be
more stimulus of the form that we did in 2009? It strikes me
that 2009 was a moment of rescue, where the, the private sector
is in freefall. We’re not in that moment anymore, and so the
right kind of policy response are those things that government
can do to get the private sector to stand up and do it.  GOLDMAN: Well, so one of those things could be an employer
 payroll tax  cut, temporary, that administration officials are
talking about. Would that provide some short-term -  GOOLSBEE: Well, look, it strikes me that the president has
said - says now - said six months ago, and has been saying for
some time that, as we’re shifting to this transitioning to a
growth phase, we want to be for any policies that are going to
help incentivize and stand up the private sector to drive the
recovery.  In the tax deal, that’s a payroll tax cut for 150 million
workers. That’s a substantial tax incentive for businesses to
invest the capital that they’ve started to accumulate on their
balance sheet.  We’ve got regulatory changes. We’ve got patent reform
changes. We’ve got Startup America, encouraging entrepreneurs.
We’re open to looking at any of these ideas.  On Monday, the president’s going to be in  North Carolina 
getting ideas from the Jobs Council. People in the private
sector, what do they think would help stand them up?  The things like the payroll tax, if it’s included in that
list, it’s something we ought to be open to looking at, but it’s
not things that are of the traditional stimulus form.  GOLDMAN: Well, I want to come back to the North Carolina
meeting on Monday, but, first, there’s very few days in the
legislative calendar before that Aug. 2 deadline to raise the
debt limit. Also, now the White House is saying they want by
July 4 a deal on debt and deficit reduction.  Republicans this week, though, they said that some would be
pushing for some short-term extensions of the debt limit. Is
that something that the president would accept?  GOOLSBEE: I don’t - I’m not in the legislative
negotiations. Obviously, that’s being led by the vice president.  GOLDMAN: Would the markets accept that?  GOOLSBEE: I don’t think the - I don’t think the markets
think we’re going to default either on Treasuries or on any of
the other government obligations. We’re a nation that pays our
bills. I really think it’s a bad idea to push it right up to the
Aug. 2 deadline. That really plays with fire.  I’m kind of encouraged, if you look on both sides - you’ve
got leaders on both sides of the aisle saying they don’t want to
push it all the way to August. They want to do it by July 4th.
And so I think we’ll - the negotiations are going reasonably
well. I think we’ll find a solution to that.  GOLDMAN: Well, that meeting on Monday, you said the
president is going to be in North Carolina. He’s going to be
meeting with top CEOs, including GE CEO Jeff Immelt. How
important is the message that the president is going to send to
the business community? And is this just going to be optics of
him standing there together?  GOOLSBEE: Well, no, I mean, the Jobs Council is 26 or so
private-sector people, a lot of big and small company CEOs.
There are some labor leaders, some economists and things like
that. They have been working for several months thinking about
the private sector’s view of, what are the - what are the
sectors of growth that this year -  GOLDMAN: So new policies could come out of this?  GOOLSBEE: New policies could come out of it. New ideas. I
think it’s helpful for the private sector to identify “here are
the broad bases of growth for the economy that would allow us to
get away from, let’s say, an over-reliance just on residential
construction and excessive  consumer spending .”  And I think the
Jobs Council is going to have a lot of that.  And the president’s - I think - I mean, I don’t want to
give away secrets of what he’s going to say -  GOLDMAN: Why not?  GOOLSBEE: - But I think he’s going to reiterate the
commitment to the - we’ve got to have a growth plan. We have to
live within our means long-term, but we’ve got to - any ideas
that people have of how the government can facilitate the
private sector driving the recovery, we should be for those
things.  GOLDMAN: Austan, after advising the president on stimulus,
on taxes, on US Weekly magazine, on Rihanna, you announced this
week that you’re going to be leaving the White House at the end
of the summer to return to the  University of Chicago . Is it
really true that tenure rules are so strict that the president’s
top economist wouldn’t have been able to come back after that
initial leave?  GOOLSBEE: Well, look, I don’t - the University of Chicago
has been beyond understanding of my time in public service and
my two-plus years working on the campaign. So I’m not - I would
never say a bad word about the university. They’ve been quite
wonderful.  The university, my family, and the president and I have
been back and forth on this for several months, and I just
decided this is probably - this is the way that it’s got to be.  GOLDMAN: So we also know that on - on jobs days, on good
jobs days, there’s sometimes been hugs or there have been fist
bumps in the Oval Office. Can we anticipate any of that before
you leave?  GOOLSBEE: Well, you know, I certainly hope so, but as you
know, I stay out of the prediction business, other than the
official forecast of the U.S. government.  GOLDMAN: Well, Austan Goolsbee, thank you very much for
joining us, and good luck with all your pursuits in the future.  And when we come back,  Newt Gingrich ’s troubles get
magnified, and time is running out to make a debt and deficit
deal. Bloomberg reporters are next.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
