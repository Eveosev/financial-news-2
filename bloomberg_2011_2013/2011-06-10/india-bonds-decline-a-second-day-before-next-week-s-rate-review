India ’s 10-year bonds dropped for a
second day, pushing yields to the highest level in more than a
week, on speculation the central bank will increase borrowing
costs for a fourth time this year.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will increase the repurchase rate
by 25 basis points to 7.50 percent when it meets on June 16,
according to 10 of 11 economists in a Bloomberg survey. One
forecast the rate will remain unchanged. The  finance ministry 
will sell 120 billion rupees ($2.7 billion) of notes due in
2018, 2021 and 2027 at an auction today.  “Bonds are down as investors are probably pricing in a
rate hike,” said R.S. Chauhan, chief dealer of fixed-income and
currency at  State Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur in Mumbai. “Appetite
is also damped by the steady supply of debt.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021 rose two
basis points today and this week to 8.29 percent as of 9:47 a.m.
in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose five basis points to 7.94 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
