Charles Munger, chief executive
officer of  Wesco Financial Corp. (WSC) , has set a July 1 session to
continue his annual tradition of taking investor questions as
his business partner  Warren Buffett  seeks full control of the
company.  The “Morning With Charlie” replaces Munger’s usual
appearance at Wesco investor meetings and will be in Pasadena,
California. Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , where Munger, 87,
is vice chairman, has agreed to buy the 20 percent of Wesco it
doesn’t already own in a deal that requires shareholder
approval. Wesco wouldn’t need annual meetings if its minority
shareholders approve the Berkshire deal on June 24.  “Charlie will make some opening remarks, and then he will
take questions from the audience about business, economics and
life,” Wesco said today in a  statement  on its website.  Munger won a cult following among investors for his
economic insights and direct matter of delivering his views. He
responded to a question about  Greece  at Berkshire’s annual
meeting in April by saying the nation had been hobbled by an
inadequate work ethic and the unwillingness to pay sufficient
taxes.  The question-and-answer session will take place whether
shareholders of Wesco approve or reject the sale, according to
the statement. Pasadena-based Wesco sells insurance, rents
furniture and stores steel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
