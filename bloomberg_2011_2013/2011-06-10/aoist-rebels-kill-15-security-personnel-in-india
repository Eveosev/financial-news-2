Maoist rebels killed 15 members of
 India ’s security forces in two attacks in a central state that
has been among the worst hit by guerrilla violence.  Insurgents overnight exploded a landmine and opened fire on
a vehicle carrying police and members of a reserve force
recruited from villages in Chhattisgarh’s  Dantewada  district,
killing 10 people, local official Omprakash Choudhary said by
phone today. Five policemen died yesterday in a rebel attack
near their camp in Narayanpur district, Press Trust of India
reported, citing Inspector General of Police Rajiv Shrivastav.  Mineral-rich Chhattisgarh is one of a dozen of India’s 28
states where the leftwing guerrillas are active. In April last
year, rebels killed 76 policemen in Dantewada district, the
deadliest attack on security forces in the decades-long conflict.  India could lose $80 billion of investment for developing
 iron ore , coal, bauxite and manganese deposits should the
government fail to stop the violence, London-based  Execution
Noble Ltd.  has said.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  has called the leftwing
rebels the greatest threat to the nation’s internal security.
Maoists killed 1,003 civilians and security forces last year,
according to the government. India in October 2009 intensified
its offensive against the guerrillas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
