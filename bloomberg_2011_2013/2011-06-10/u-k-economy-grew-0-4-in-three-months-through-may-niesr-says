U.K. economic growth accelerated in
the three months through May, the National Institute of Economic
and Social Research said today.  Gross domestic product rose 0.4 percent after rising 0.1
percent in the quarter through April, the London-based group,
whose clients include the  Bank of England  and the U.K. Treasury,
said in an e-mailed statement.  “Economic growth in the U.K. remains subdued,” Niesr said
in the statement. “These figures suggest the level of output is
still almost 4 percent below its pre-recession peak. We do not
expect the level of output to return to the pre-recession peak
until early 2013.”  The  International Monetary Fund  lowered its 2011 U.K.
growth forecast this week to 1.5 percent from 1.7 percent in
April and said growth will quicken to 2.5 percent in the medium
term. The Bank of England kept its benchmark interest rate at a
record low of 0.5 percent yesterday as policy makers prioritized
the threat to the recovery from the government’s budget squeeze
over faster-than-targeted inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
