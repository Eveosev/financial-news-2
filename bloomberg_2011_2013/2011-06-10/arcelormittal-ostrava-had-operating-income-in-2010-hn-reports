ArcelorMittal Ostrava AS had an
operating income in 2010 after a loss of about 2 billion koruna
($120 million) in 2009,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing
Chief Executive Officer Augustine Kochuparampil.  The company will report full earnings next week, the
newspaper said.  ArcelorMittalâ€™s Czech unit ran at 65 percent of production
capacity last year due to a decline in demand, the newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
