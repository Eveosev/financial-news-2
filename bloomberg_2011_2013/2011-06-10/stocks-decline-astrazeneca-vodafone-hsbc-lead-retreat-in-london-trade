U.K. stocks erased their losses as
Prudential Plc and Johnson Matthey Plc advanced, offsetting
declines at Lonmin Plc and Eurasian Natural Resources Corp.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index climbed 7.45, or 0.1 percent,
to 5,863.79 at 9:59 a.m. in  London , extending yesterday’s 0.8
percent advance. The gauge has lost 2.1 percent so far this
month as reports on U.S. employment and factory orders added to
concern the world’s largest economy is faltering. The FTSE All-
Share Index also gained 0.1 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index dropped 0.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
