Corn surged to a record approaching
$8 a bushel on signs that global inventories will drop as
adverse weather slashes acreage in the U.S., the world’s top
producer, and demand rise for livestock feed and ethanol.  Worldwide stockpiles will be 111.89 metric million tons
before the 2012 harvest in the Northern Hemisphere, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said yesterday. That was down from
129.14 million forecast in May and 117.44 million that the
agency says will be in storage by Oct. 1. U.S. supplies before
the 2012 harvest were estimated at the lowest since 1996.  Prices have more than doubled in the past year as wet
weather limited the size of the 2010 U.S. harvest. Flooding in
the past two months delayed planting and threatened this year’s
crop prospects. The rally is boosting expenses for meat
producers including Tyson Foods Inc. and makers of grain-based
ethanol such as Poet LLC. Global food costs climbed in nine of
the past 11 months, reaching a record in February.  “The USDA told the markets yesterday that corn supplies
will stay tight for another year,” said Brian Grete, the senior
market analyst for the Professional Farmers of America
newsletter in  Cedar Falls ,  Iowa . “Now, we have a long-term
story of tight supplies, and that means higher prices.”  Corn futures for July delivery rose 1.5 cents, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $7.87 at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier, the price reached a record $7.9975. The previous
all-time high was $7.9925 in June 2008. This week, the price
jumped 4.4 percent.  Food Riots, OPEC  Food-price inflation and high unemployment helped spur
unrest in northern  Africa  and the  Middle East  this year. Energy
costs have surged amid fighting in  Libya , a member of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. This week, OPEC
failed to reach an accord on production targets.  The U.S. corn harvest may be 2.3 percent smaller than
forecast in May after heavy Midwest rains left fields too wet
for sowing, the government said yesterday.  Planted acreage was forecast at 90.7 million acres, down
1.6 percent from last month’s projection. In a survey released
in late March, farmers indicated they planned to sow 92.178
million acres with corn this year. The USDA will update its
estimate of farmers’ intentions in a report on June 30.  More than a third of Midwest fields were planted after the
mid-May target for optimal growth because of excessive rain, and
Ohio farmers as of June 5 were the furthest behind since 1989,
with 58 percent sown, government data show.  Farmland Swamped  Floods damaged as much as 6.8 million acres of farmland
across the South and Midwest, according to the U.S.  Army Corps 
of Engineers.  “We came into this year needing to produce a record crop
to build inventories,” said Bill Gentry, a broker at  Risk
Management Commodities Inc.  in Lafayette,  Indiana . “Cash
markets are on fire trying to get supplies.”  In the week ended June 3, U.S. ethanol production rose 0.7
percent to an average of 915,000 barrels a day, the highest
since January, government data showed. On May 4, the national
average of regular gasoline at the pump reached $3.985 a gallon,
the highest since July 2008, according to AAA, a U.S. motoring
organization.  A record 5 billion bushels of corn will go into ethanol
production in the year that ends Aug. 31, the USDA said
yesterday. That’s 40 percent of last year’s harvest.  “Ethanol production is rising, and we are not building
inventories,” Gentry said. “There are no signs yet that demand
for corn is slowing with the higher prices.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
