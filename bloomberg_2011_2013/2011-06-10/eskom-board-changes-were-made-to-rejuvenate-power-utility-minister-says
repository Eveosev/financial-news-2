Minister Malusi Gigaba removed most of the board of Eskom
Holdings Ltd. so that the power utility can be “rejuvenated and
strengthened,” the department said.  The incoming board will have “strong technical
engineering, project and structured finance expertise,” the
Pretoria-based department said in an e-mailed statement today.
Changes to the board of state-owned rail and ports company,
Transnet SOC Ltd., are still being discussed, the statement
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
