The French port of La Rochelle, the
country’s second-largest cereal-export hub, shipped 306,859
metric tons of wheat and spelt in May, with Algeria the biggest
buyer.  Algeria was the destination for 68,500 tons of wheat,
followed by  Ivory Coast  with 45,226 tons of the grain, the  Grand
Port Maritime de La Rochelle  said in an e-mailed statement late
yesterday. The port, located on the Bay of Biscay, gave no year-
earlier figures. Corn exports were 57,688 tons.  La Pallice accounted for 19 percent of  France ’s wheat
exports in 2009-10, behind Rouen on the Seine River, which
shipped out 45 percent, according to data from national crops
office FranceAgriMer. La Pallice is the industrial harbor of La
Rochelle, according to the World Port Source  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
