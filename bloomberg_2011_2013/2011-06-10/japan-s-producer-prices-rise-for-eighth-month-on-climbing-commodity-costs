Japan ’s producer prices rose for an
eight month in May, pushed up by higher energy and raw material
costs.  Prices companies pay for energy and unfinished goods gained
2.2 percent from a year earlier, after climbing 2.5 percent in
April, a Bank of Japan report showed today. The median estimate
of 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 2.5
percent gain.  Crude oil has risen 37 percent the past year and the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities has soared 47
percent during the period. Toyobo Co., a maker of fiber and
chemical material, this month said it will increase prices of
industrial film because of higher raw-material costs.  “Given the solid economic growth of  Asia , one of the
biggest consumers of resources, as well as accommodative
monetary environments worldwide, commodity prices are likely to
stay high over the long term,”  Kyohei Morita , chief economist at
 Barclays Capital  in Tokyo, said before the report was released.  Bank of Japan board members predicted in April the
country’s producer prices will rise 2.2 percent in the year to
March 2012 and its increase will slow to 0.6 percent in the
following year. The BOJ will update those forecasts next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
