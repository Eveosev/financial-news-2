European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said public finances in the euro area as a
whole are “sound” and governments will be able to “stop the
adverse debt dynamics” caused by the financial crisis.  “Of course, there is absolutely no reason for complacency
in the euro area,” Trichet said at a conference in Frankfurt
today. “Much more remains to be done, especially in terms of
employment creation, reduction of the level of unemployment and
enhancement of  Europe ’s growth potential.”  Trichet also said that euro-area authorities should
introduce “more speed and automaticity in the sanctioning
mechanism.” He didn’t make a reference to monetary policy after
the central bank kept its benchmark interest rate at 1.25
percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
