BM&F Bovespa SA, the operator of
 Brazil ’s main stock exchange, said it is in talks with the
bourses of  Peru  and Colombia to allow for cross-border trading.  BM&F Bovespa SA said in an e-mail today that it is seeking
cross-border trading agreements with the two Andean countries
along the “same terms” as an accord reached last December with
Bolsa de Comercio de Santiago, the operator of Chile’s main
securities exchange.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
