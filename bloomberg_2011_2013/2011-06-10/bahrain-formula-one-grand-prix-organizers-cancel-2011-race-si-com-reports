The 2011 Bahrain Formula One Grand
Prix has been canceled,  Sports Illustrated  reported on its
website, citing local race organizers.  “It has been made clear that this fixture cannot progress
and we fully respect that decision,” Bahrain International
Circuit Chairman Zayed R. Alzayani said in a statement,
according to SI.com.   Phone calls to the chief executive’s office at Bahrain
International Circuit and to its public relations number weren’t
answered.   F-1’s ruling body said June 3 that the race would be staged
on Oct. 30, replacing a scheduled stop in  India . The Indian race
would have become the final round of this year’s championship.  The Bahrain race had been slated to open the season on
March 13. Bahraini Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad  Al Khalifa 
suspended it on Feb. 21, three days after five people were
killed as police broke up demonstrations by activists seeking
democratic changes. At least 30 people have died since the
protests began, the Associated Press reported.  For Related News and Information:
