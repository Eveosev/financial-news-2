Spanish home sales declined the most
in almost two years in April as the highest  unemployment rate  in
 Europe  and the end of a tax rebate discouraged buyers.  The number of transactions fell 29.7 percent from a year
earlier, after an 11.9 percent drop in March, the National
Statistics Institute in Madrid said today. That was the steepest
decline since May 2009.  Spain , which has a 21 percent unemployment rate after a
three-year slump, is working through an excess of 1 million
homes left unsold by the collapse of a debt-fueled construction
boom. To clear the backlog, the government scrapped a tax rebate
on mortgage payments and gave buyers a year’s warning before
doing so to encourage them to bring forward purchases.  The decision prompted a surge in home sales through most of
2010 and the first two months of 2011 as buyers hurried to
purchase properties and lock in a tax break of as much as 1,352
euros ($1,957) a year.  Spain’s recovery from an almost two-year recession is being
led by exports as households rein in spending to pay down debt.
The deepest austerity measures, including public wage cuts and a
freeze on pensions, are also undermining  consumer spending .  To contact the reporter on this story:
