Chilean policy makers will raise
borrowing costs next week on prospects that annual inflation
exceeds central bank targets, according to the median estimate
of 70 economists in a monthly central bank survey.  The bank will raise its benchmark rate to 5.25 percent on
June 14 from 5 percent after increasing lending costs by a half-
point at its past three meetings, today’s survey said. All but
five of the 12 of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimate the
central bank will raise rates by a quarter-point in June.  Consumer prices will grow 0.3 percent in June from the
previous month as annual inflation climbs to 4.2 percent in
December from 3.3 percent in May, according to the survey. The
bank targets annual inflation of 3 percent, plus or minus 1
percentage point over a 24-month horizon.  “The biggest inflationary pressures come from the expected
acceleration in salaries and retail margins,” Inversiones
Security wrote in a June 8 note to clients. “The central bank
could raise the monetary policy rate by 25 basis points in its
next policy meeting.”  Chile ’s one-year interest-rate swap, which reflects
traders’ views of future rate decisions, has risen to 5.62
percent from 5.47 percent on May 12 when the central bank held
its last monthly meeting.  Faster Than Potential  The economy will expand 6.3 percent this year and 5.3
percent in 2012, according to the survey. Economists estimated
the economy would expand 6.3 percent in 2011 and 5.5 percent
next year in the previous survey, published May 10.  Chile’s central bank will have to raise its benchmark rate
if the South American country continues to grow faster than its
potential,  Alfredo Coutino , Latin America director at Moody’s
Analytics, said in a June 8 report.  “There is no doubt that the Chilean economy is running at
overheating speed, given the existence of an excess demand,” he
wrote. “The central bank will have to keep normalizing monetary
conditions, with the policy rate approaching a more neutral
stance, better sooner rather than later.”  Policy makers will raise rates to 6 percent by December
this year, holding them there through at least May 2013,
according to today’s survey.  The peso weakened 0.2 percent to 467.45 per dollar at 8:35
a.m. New York time from 466.61 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
