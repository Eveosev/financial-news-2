The rand declined for a third day
against the dollar, heading for biggest weekly drop in four, as
concern a resolution to  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis will be
delayed prompted investors to sell riskier assets.  The currency of Africa’s biggest economy weakened as much
as 0.8 percent to 6.7867 per dollar, and traded at 6.7754 at
3:15 p.m. in Johannesburg, bringing its retreat against the
greenback to 0.9 percent. It depreciated less than 0.1 percent
to 9.7910 per euro.  The euro fell against the dollar and was weaker versus 10
of its 16 major peers after European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  rejected any direct participation in a
second bailout for  Greece . The rand often tracks the euro, the
currency of most of South Africa’s trade, with a statistical
correlation of 0.812 over the past month. A value of 1 would
mean they moved in lock step.  “The modest recovery in the dollar and gradually rising
 risk aversion  still tilts the scales in favor of a tactical long
dollar position to test levels back towards 6.80/85,” Tradition
Analytics researchers led by Johannesburg-based Quinten Bertenshaw said in a research note.  The euro extended its decline against the dollar, heading
for the first weekly drop in a month, as Trichet signaled a
slowing pace of interest-rate increases this year.  “The euro’s multi-week upside momentum has been broken by
ECB President Trichet, thus taking away any impetus” for the
rand to strengthen,  John Cairns  and Nema Ramkhelawan, currency
strategists at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in a
research note.  Bonds declined. The 13.5 percent notes due 2015 dropped 15
cents to 121.60 rand, driving the yield up three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.46 percent. The 6.75 percent
securities due 2021 slipped 39 cents to 89.80 rand, boosting the
yield six basis points to 8.26 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
