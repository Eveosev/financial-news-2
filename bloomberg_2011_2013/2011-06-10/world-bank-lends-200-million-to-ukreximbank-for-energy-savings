The  World Bank  agreed to lend $200
million to the State Export-Import Bank of Ukraine JSC to
improve  energy efficiency .  “To reduce Ukraine’s energy intensity by 50 percent by
2030, as the government plans, will require around $20 billion
in investments,” Martin Raiser, World Bank Country Director for
Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, said today in an e-mailed
 statement . He added that “these would easily pay for themselves
through improved competitiveness, reduced import needs and
greater energy security.”  Ukraine, which has a population of 46 million, relies on
Russian natural gas imports for more than 50 percent of its
needs. The country plans to purchase 40 billion cubic meters of
gas this year, according to Energy and Coal Minister Yuriy Boyko.  To contact the reporter on this story:
