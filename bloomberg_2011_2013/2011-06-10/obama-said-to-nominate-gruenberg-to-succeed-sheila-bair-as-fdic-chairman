President  Barack Obama  intends to
nominate Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vice Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg to succeed  Sheila Bair  as chairman, according to a
White House statement.  Gruenberg has served as the agency’s vice chairman since
2005, and served as acting chairman for six months in 2005 and
2006. Obama announced his selection in an e-mailed statement
today. Bloomberg News previously reported Obama’s decision.  Gruenberg would replace Bair, who was appointed by former
President  George W. Bush  and took office in June 2006. She led
the agency through the worst wave of banking failures since the
savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s. She is scheduled to step
down as chairman after her term ends in July.  Before joining the agency, Gruenberg served as senior
counsel to Senator Paul Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat, and as
staff counsel to the Senate Banking subcommittee on
international finance and monetary policy.  Gruenberg graduated from Case Western Reserve University’s
law school and  Princeton University ’s Woodrow Wilson School of
Public and International Affairs.  His nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
