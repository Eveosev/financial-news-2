 Internet service provider , sought bankruptcy protection from
creditors without citing a reason for the filing.  The company, based in  Bala Cynwyd , Pennsylvania, today

company, wasn’t immediately available to comment.  Xanadoo, started in 2006, provides high-speed fourth-

 Illinois , and later expanded into Lawton, Oklahoma, as well as
in Lubbock, Abilene and Wichita Falls, Texas, according to the
website. It also has licensed spectrum in 11 states in the
Midwest and Southwest. Xanadoo mobile network infrastructure is
built using Cisco Systems Inc. products.  The 20 largest unsecured creditors on a consolidated basis
are owed about $1.3 million, court papers show.  The case is In re Xanadoo Holdings Inc., 11-11775, U.S.
