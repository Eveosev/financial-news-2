What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower
on the Chicago Board of Trade on concern that the global
economic recovery may slow and curb demand while world
inventories remain adequate, said  Don Roose , the president of
U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. Soybean-oil
futures are expected to open 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound lower,
and soybean-meal futures may open down $2 to $3 for 2,000 pounds
of the  animal feed .  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as increased harvesting of U.S. winter wheat in
the southern Great Plains boosts immediate supplies after the
government yesterday said the crop will be larger than analysts
expected, Roose said.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 6 cents a bushel
lower in  Chicago  on speculation that demand will slow as meat
producers substitute cheaper supplies of wheat in livestock
feed, Roose said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
