Compass Group Plc (CPG) , the world’s
largest caterer, got approval from  Turkey ’s antitrust board to
buy a remaining stake in its unit Sofra Yemek Uretim & Hizmet AS
from STFA Yatirim Holding AS.  Compass’s purchase of the 49.9 percent stake in Sofra, an
Istanbul-based food and support-service business, won’t hurt
competition, the board said on its  website  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
