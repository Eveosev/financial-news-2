The  International Finance
Corporation  (IFC), the  World Bank ’s private sector lending arm,
approved a  credit line  to Eurobank EFG a.d., the Serbian unit of
Greek-based  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB) , to expand trade financing.  Eurobank EFG a.d ., Serbia’s third-biggest lender by assets
at the end of 2010, will receive $20 million and “use the
facility to increase trade finance offerings and mobilize pre-
export financing for companies active in the country’s key job-
creating sectors, including small and medium enterprises,” the
IFC said in an e-mail.  Two years after the global recession, Serbia is still
struggling to achieve the pre-crisis pace of growth, with the
government increasingly seeking investors for idling factories
to revive industrial output, cut unemployment from 20 percent
and ensure exports for more sustainable growth, seen as
accelerating to 4.5 percent in 2012 from 3 percent this year.  The IFC launched the Global Trade Finance Program in 2005,
backing guarantees of more than $12 billion worth of trade
transactions in emerging markets, where access to trade finance
is fairly limited.  To contact the reporter on this story:
