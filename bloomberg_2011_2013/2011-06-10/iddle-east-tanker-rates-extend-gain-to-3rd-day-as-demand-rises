The cost of shipping Middle East oil
to  Asia , the world’s busiest route for supertankers, gained for
a third straight day as demand strengthened.  Charter costs for very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, on
the industry’s benchmark  Saudi Arabia  to Japan route rose 0.2
percent to 58.6 Worldscale points, according to the  Baltic
Exchange  in  London . That equates to returns of $13,236 a day
from the voyage.  Demand over the past week has been “solid” and that may
continue next week because oil companies will need to start
hiring vessels for loading in July, London-based E.A. Gibson
Shipbrokers Ltd. said in an e-mailed report today.  VLCCs have cut speeds by 9.3 percent this year to an
average of 10.07 knots as ship fuel prices jumped, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That reduces how many are available
for hire as they take longer to get back to cargo-loading ports.  Worldscale points are a percentage of a nominal rate, or
flat rate, for more than 320,000 specific routes. Flat rates for
every voyage, quoted in U.S. dollars a metric ton, are revised
annually by the Worldscale Association in London to reflect
changing fuel costs, port tariffs and exchange rates.  Each flat rate assessment gives owners and  oil companies  a
starting point for negotiating hire rates without having to
calculate the value of each deal from scratch.  The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, a gauge of crude-oil
shipping costs that includes vessels smaller than VLCCs, fell
for a 12th session, sliding 0.1 percent to 732 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
