There’s no risk of frost in coffee
growing regions in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer, in the
next 15 days, weather forecaster Somar Meteorologia said.  Winter temperatures will be no lower than 5 degrees Celsius
(41 degrees Fahrenheit), Somar agronomist Marco Antonio dos
Santos said yesterday in an e-mailed response to questions.  Frost in Brazilian growing regions can damage trees bearing
the following year’s crop. Coffee futures soared to a record
$3.375 a pound in 1977 after damage from frosts in Brazil two
years earlier, according to Bloomberg data. Frost in 1994
damaged 35 percent of the crop by 1997, according to Somar,
sending prices up to $3.18 a pound that year.  Arabica coffee for September delivery rose 1.45 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $2.713 a pound today on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York  by 8:53 a.m. London time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
