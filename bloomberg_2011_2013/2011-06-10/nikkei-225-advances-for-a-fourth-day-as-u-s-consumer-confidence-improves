The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained
for a fourth day as reports in the U.S. suggested that the
recovery in the world’s biggest economy is still on track.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the No. 1 carmaker by sales, climbed
0.9 percent ahead of the automaker’s earnings forecast today.
 Tokio Marine Holdings Inc. (8766) , a casualty insurer, gained 1.5
percent after the Nikkei newspaper reported it will buy a stake
in a California-based insurer.  Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662) ,
an oil driller, jumped 2.6 percent after crude traded near the
highest this month. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., a drugmaker, sank
2.9 percent after  France  suspended the sale of its best selling
medicine, citing cancer risk.  “The pace of the U.S. recovery has slowed, but it’s not so
bad that it’s going to fall into recession,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a senior strategist in  Tokyo  at Mitsubishi UFJ　Asset
Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $84 billion.
“ Consumer spending  is relatively solid and even though
sentiment isn’t strong, it’s improving.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.5 percent to 9,514.44
as of the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The gauge rose 0.2 percent for
the week, snapping four consecutive weeks of losses.  The broader Topix increased 0.5 percent to 817.38. The
Topix has tumbled 12 percent since March 10, the day before a
magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s northeast
coast, damaging nuclear plants, disrupting supply chains, and
leaving almost 24,000 people dead or missing.  Consumer Comfort  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.7 percent in  New
York  yesterday, rising for the first day in seven, after a
report showed that the  U.S. trade deficit  unexpectedly narrowed
in April, reflecting a plunge in oil imports combined with
record exports. Commerce Department figures showed yesterday the
gap shrank 6.7 percent to $43.7 billion in April, the lowest
since December.  A separate report showed that  consumer confidence  rose last
week for the third consecutive time as lower gasoline prices
lifted Americans’ outlook on their finances. The Bloomberg
Consumer Comfort Index climbed to minus 45.9 in the period to
June 5, the best showing since the end of April, from the prior
week’s minus 47.1. Across income groups, sentiment improved the
most among people making less than $50,000 a year. A reading of
minus 100 indicates every respondent held a negative view and a
reading of zero means sentiment is evenly split.  Carmakers Gain  Automakers were the biggest contributors to the Topix’s
gain among its 33 industry groups ahead of Toyota’s announcement
of its fiscal year earnings forecast for the 12 months ending
March 2012 today. Daiwa Securities Group Inc. also maintained a
sector rating of “buy.”  Toyota gained 0.9 percent to 3,300 yen. Honda Motor Co., a
carmaker that get more than 80 percent of its sales abroad, rose
0.9 percent to 2,985 yen.  “Toyota’s plan to release earnings forecasts has investors
thinking that the supply chain is recovering more quickly than
people expected,” said Toshihiko Matsuno, an analyst at SMBC
Friend Securities Co.’s investment advisory department.  Toyota forecast full-year profit that fell short of
analyst estimates as declining sales from a loss in output and a
stronger yen eroded earnings. Net income may decline to 280
billion yen ($3.5 billion) in the 12 months ending in March,
from 408.1 billion yen a year earlier, the automaker said in a
statement after the market closed today. That compares with the
421.8 billion yen average of 13 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg in the past 28 days.  Oil Prices Advance  Oil companies  had the biggest gain in the Topix among its
33 industry groups.  Japan  Petroleum jumped 2.6 percent to 3,900
yen and its bigger rival Inpex Corp. rose 1.9 percent to 588,000
yen. Crude oil for July delivery yesterday rose 1.2 percent to
the highest settlement since May 31 in New York, after OPEC
failed to reach an accord on output targets for the first time
in at least 20 years. Ministers from the 12-nation Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries were unable to come to
agreement in five hours of talks in Vienna yesterday.  Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., which makes turbine
generators, pumps, and industrial robots, jumped 4.3 percent to
293 yen after Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised the company’s
investment rating to “buy” from “neutral,” saying in a
Japanese-language report dated yesterday “increasing demand for
emergency-use and in-house power generations is a tail wind for
the company.”  Tokio Marine climbed 1.5 percent to 2,189 yen, after the
Nikkei reported the casualty insurer plans to pay 3.2 billion
yen for 49 percent of WNC Holdings, a U.S.-based insurer of
mortgages.  Takeda sank 2.9 percent to 3,665 yen, the biggest drop in
the  Nikkei 225. (NKY)  A French regulator said doctors should no longer
prescribe Actos, Takeda’s best selling drug, following a study
that showed the medicine carried a slightly increased risk of
bladder cancer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
