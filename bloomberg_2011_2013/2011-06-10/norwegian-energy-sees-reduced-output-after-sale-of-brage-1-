Norwegian Energy Co. ASA expects
production for this year at about 7,000 barrels of oil
equivalents a day after the sale of its Brage field.  Noreco agreed last month to sell its stakes in the
Norwegian oil fields Brage and Hyme, a deal it expects to
complete “this summer,” the Stavanger-based company said today
in a statement. Its current production is about 10,000 barrels
of oil equivalents a day from eight fields in  Denmark  and
 Norway , Noreco said.  Next year the company will start output from new fields
Huntington and Oselvar, which will contribute to “significant
earnings growth” and a “stronger” financial position, the
company said.  Noreco said it has “sufficient” liquidity to meet its
commitments and complete its investment program in field
developments and exploration wells. The company said it’s also
working on a permanent repair of the Siri platform in Denmark.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
