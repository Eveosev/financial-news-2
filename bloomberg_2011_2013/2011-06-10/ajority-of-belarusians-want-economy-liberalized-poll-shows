Two thirds of Belarusians want their
country’s state-managed economy to be more market-oriented,
according to a recent poll by the Independent Institute of
Socio-Economic and Political Studies.  Two fifths said their income was barely enough to buy food,
according to the Lithuania-based polling group, which questioned
1,505 people in face-to-face interviews in May. Still, 8.2 of
the respondents said they were ready to take part in public
protests, said the group, which moved its headquarters away from
Belarus in 2005 after being shut down by the  Supreme Court .  The Belarusian economy has been damaged by excessive public
spending, the  International Monetary Fund  has said. It
allowed an overnight 36 percent devaluation of its currency May
23 and raised its refinancing rate to 16 percent, the highest in
the world, a week later.  Liberalization of the centralized economy, which is
dependent on exports of farm machinery and dairy products to
 Russia , isn’t on the agenda, President Alexander Lukashenko told
a government meeting yesterday.  The poll has a margin of error of 0.03 percent, IISEP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
