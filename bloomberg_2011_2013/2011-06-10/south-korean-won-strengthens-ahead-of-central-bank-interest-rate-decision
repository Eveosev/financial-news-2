South Korea ’s won strengthened
before the central bank’s monthly review of  interest rates .
Bonds fell.  Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo is seeking to tame
inflation, which exceeded the central bank’s target for a fifth
month in May, without curbing growth in an economy threatened by
rising household debt and slowdowns in the U.S. and  China . Nine
of 17 economists expect the benchmark rate will stay unchanged
at 3 percent, while eight forecast an increase of a quarter of a
percentage point, a Bloomberg News survey shows. The meeting
began at 9 a.m. and a decision is due around 10 a.m. local time.  “Investors are taking a very cautious position ahead of
the interest rate-setting meeting today,” said Kim Jin Ju,
currency dealer at  Korea  Exchange Bank in Seoul. “The won is
likely to move in a tight range until any direction is suggested
after the rate announcement.”  The won rose 0.25 percent to 1,080.23 per dollar as of 9:47
a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank raised rates by 25 basis points in January
and March before unexpectedly keeping them unchanged last month.
Kim said on May 18 that the Bank of Korea will continue to boost
borrowing costs at its own pace and also that the nation needs
to be wary of an inflation spiral.  Five-year government bonds dropped, with the yield on the
notes due March 2016 rising four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.87 percent, the highest since June 1,
according to prices from Korea Exchange Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
