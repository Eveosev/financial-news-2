Middle East crude oil grades for
sale to  Asia  rose by the most in four weeks as producers
increased official prices to the highest in almost three years
after OPECâ€™s failure to reach an accord on output targets.  Oman crude for immediate loading advanced $3.43, or 3.1
percent this week to $112.51 barrel, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Dubai oil for loading in August climbed 3.2
percent to $112.05 over the same period, while Murban increased
3 percent to $116.82. The three grades posted the biggest weekly
gain since May 13.  Both Abu Dhabi National and Qatar Petroleum issued new
official prices that are at the highest levels since July 2008
when compared with the benchmark Dubai crude price from
publishing service Platts.  Brent crude oil for July delivery has gained 2.7 percent
this week on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Ministers from the 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries were unable to come to an accord on whether to raise
production targets in a meeting in Vienna this week.  Qatar Land was at a discount of 2 cents a barrel below
official prices compared with a premium of 5 cents a week
earlier as higher official prices reduced demand from refiners,
Bloomberg data showed. Qatar Marine traded at a discount of 18
cents today from a premium of 2 cents yesterday. The Marine
grade was at a discount of 48 cents on June 1.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for July widened $1.12
this week to $7.60 a barrel, data from London-based broker PVM
Oil Associates showed. The exchange for swaps for August climbed
83 cents to $7.12 a barrel.  Oman futures for August delivery fell 55 cents to $112.40 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:30 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,043 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$112.32 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
