Germany  should provide troops for
any future peacekeeping mission in  Libya , Der Tagesspiegel cited
Andreas Schockenhoff, deputy parliamentary leader of  Chancellor
Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democratic bloc, as saying.  Germany’s refusal to take part in military action in Libya
applies only to NATO airstrikes aimed at enforcing a United
Nations no-flight zone, Schockenhoff was  cited  as saying in the
newspaper today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
