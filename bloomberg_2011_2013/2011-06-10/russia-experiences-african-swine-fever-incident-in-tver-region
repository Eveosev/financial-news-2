Laboratory tests detected the
African Swine Fever virus in the body of a piglet from the
Kalininsky district of  Russia ’s Tver region, said the country’s
food-safety agency,  Rosselkhoznadzor .  Inspectors are studying how the animal came to be infected
with the virus, the agency said today in an e-mailed news
release. The Tver region is northwest of Moscow.  About 17,000 pigs have died or been slaughtered this year
in Russia because of the disease, on top of 60,000 last year,
Rosselkhoznadzor said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
