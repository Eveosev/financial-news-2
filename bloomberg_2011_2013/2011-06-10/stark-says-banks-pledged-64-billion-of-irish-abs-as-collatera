Banks have pledged about 44 billion
euros ($63.6 billion) of Irish asset-backed securities as
collateral to raise cash from the  European Central Bank ,
Executive Board member Juergen Stark said.  The securities are being used to guarantee about 10 billion
euros of loans, said Stark told reporters today in  Frankfurt .  Germany ’s Spiegel magazine reported on May 23 that the
ECB’s laxness in vetting asset-backed securities submitted as
collateral in peripheral European countries masks risks on its
balance sheet that may amount to as much as several hundred
billion euros.  “The statement made in public that huge amounts of low-
quality ABS have been” pledged to the ECB “is simply wrong,”
Stark said.  Banks posted 488 billion euros of securities backed by
consumer and home loans as of Sept. 30, 2010, compared with 474
billion euros at the end of 2009, according to data compiled by
the ECB. The ECB is providing 23 euros of loans for every 100
euros of bonds backed by Irish homes or consumer loans,
according to Bloomberg calculations.  Banks create asset-backed securities by pooling consumer
and property loans and selling them to investors as notes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
