Daily Mail and General Trust Plc, 
the publisher of Britain’s Daily Mail newspaper, is considering
selling its U.S. trade show business, George Little Management.  “There is limited opportunity to leverage the GLM assets
across the wider DMGT group,” the company said in a statement
today. The company aims to focus its events business “onto
fewer areas with exceptional opportunities such as our portfolio
of energy shows and our activities in the  Middle East .”  Daily Mail and General Trust slumped 7.5 percent on May 26
after the company said it is “cautious” about the full-year
outlook as advertising revenue for April and the first three
weeks of May were below last year’s level. George Little
Management manages retail-focused events including the  New York 
International Gift Fair.  The company said it appointed Jordan, Edmiston Group, based
in New York, as financial advisors to seek strategic
alternatives for the U.S. trade show business.  The business, which has been looked at by Reed Elsevier
Plc, United Business Media Ltd. and Informa Plc, could be valued
at about $200 million, the Financial Times reported earlier,
without saying how it got the information.  Daily Mail  and General Trust rose 0.9 percent to 440.5
pence in London trading as of 8:01 a.m., valuing the company at
1.7 billion pounds ($2.8 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
