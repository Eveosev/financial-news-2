Salvatore Ferragamo SpA’s initial
public offering may raise as much as 401.9 million euros ($576.2
million), the luxury shoemaker said in a statement.  Ferragamo plans to sell about 38.3 million shares, equal to
a 23 percent stake, at a price range of 8 euros to 10.50 euros a
share for its offering in Milan, the Florence, Italy-based
company said yesterday. The IPO would value the company at as
much as 1.77 billion euros.  Including an overallotment option, the offering would raise
as much as 442.1 million euros. The shares will be on offer from
June 13 through June 23, the 84-year-old shoemaker said.  Ferragamo and other luxury-goods makers including Prada SpA
are planning to sell shares to the public as demand for bags and
shoes in Asia fuels growth and draws investors. The IPO values
Ferragamo at as much as 24.4 times 2011 profit as estimated by
banks arranging the sale. By contrast,  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA (MC) , the world’s largest maker of luxury products, trades
at about 18 times earnings.  Not all luxury-goods makers are opting for a public
listing, however. Moncler SpA on June 6 pulled its plans to list
shares in Milan, citing market conditions. The maker of $1,000
ski jackets chose instead to sell a stake to investment firm
Eurazeo.  Prada’s IPO  Prada, which intends to list in Hong Kong, set a price
range of HK$36.50 ($4.69) to HK$48 per share for its IPO, two
people with knowledge of the matter said June 6. The offering
would raise $2 billion to $2.6 billion based on the range,
according to the people, making the Italian company’s share sale
the largest consumer-goods IPO in  Hong Kong . The stock is
scheduled to start trading on June 24.  Banca IMI, which is helping to manage Ferragamo’s IPO,
estimates the maker of 350-euro black satin sandals may post net
income of 72.6 million euros this year and 86.9 million euros in
2012. The shoemaker, founded in 1927, ranks in the medium-high
to high-end of the fashion market, according to IMI.  Ferragamo, whose shoes have been worn by  Marilyn Monroe  and
 Jennifer Lopez , reported net profit of 60.8 million euros in
2010 compared with a loss of 14.7 million euros a year earlier.
Sales climbed 26 percent to 781.6 million euros. Earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization advanced 83 percent
in the period to 113.1 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
