European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said authorities need to
strengthen the region’s monetary union as soon as the immediate
crisis fueled by banking and sovereign debt woes has ebbed.  “Once we have finished fire-fighting and completed the
legislative package, I believe we need to look into a further
strengthening of the euro-area institutions, its external
representation and other aspects to improve the functioning of
the euro zone,” Rehn said in a speech in Brussels today.  Rehn also endorsed European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet’s call last week for a “substantial deepening of
integration and institutions” in the single-currency area.  Amid the ongoing banking and debt crisis, economic recovery
in Europe is “maintaining its momentum” and becoming more
“self-sustaining,” Rehn said. He said EU economic policy needs
to promote innovation, noting that  China  is on pace to surpass
 Europe ’s research and development spending by 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
