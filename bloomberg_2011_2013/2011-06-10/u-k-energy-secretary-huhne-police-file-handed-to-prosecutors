British prosecutors received a
police report on an investigation into whether U.K. Energy
Secretary  Chris Huhne  asked his former wife to take the blame
for a speeding violation.  The  Crown Prosecution Service  in London received the first
batch of evidence from police in Essex,  England , last night,
spokesman Tim McAtackney said.  “It’s not a full file of evidence, and we’re nowhere near
a charging decision,” McAtackney said. “The police
investigation is ongoing.”  The energy secretary is under investigation for allegations
that he asked Vicky Pryce in 2003 to to say she’d been driving
his car when it was caught speeding so he wouldn’t lose his
license. He denies the charge.  A call to Huhne’s office in London wasn’t immediately
answered.  To contact the reporter for this story:
