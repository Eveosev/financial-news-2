Ally Financial Inc., the auto and
home lender preparing for an initial public offering, delayed
plans to start marketing the IPO until equity markets improve,
according to a person familiar with the plans.  The company is moving ahead with the process so that it can
sell shares once market conditions improve, according to the
person, who declined to be identified because the plans aren’t
public. Ally had been working toward a $5 billion to $7 billion
sale in late June, people familiar with the company’s proposal
said earlier this year.  Jim Olecki, a spokesman for the Detroit-based bank, and
 Matt Anderson  of the U.S. Treasury Department declined to
comment. The Treasury had been seeking to wind down its 73.8
percent stake in the lender. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
rose for the first time in seven trading days yesterday, ending
its longest slump since February 2009.  The Financial Times reported earlier that Ally is dropping
the IPO because of market conditions and possible fines related
to foreclosure practices, without saying where it got the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
