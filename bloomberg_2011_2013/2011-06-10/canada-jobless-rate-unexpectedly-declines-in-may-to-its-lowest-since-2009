Canada’s jobless rate unexpectedly
declined in May to the lowest since January 2009 as the economy
added workers for the seventh time in eight months.  The  unemployment rate  fell to 7.4 percent last month from
April’s 7.6 percent, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa, as
employment rose by 22,300. Economists forecast 20,000 new jobs
and no change in the jobless rate, according to the median
estimates in Bloomberg surveys.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  and Bank of Canada Governor
 Mark Carney  have said they are relying on business spending to
drive the economy as government stimulus winds down after the
recession. The Bank of Canada says growth is likely to slow to a
2 percent annual pace in the April-June period after a 3.9
percent first-quarter rate, and policy makers said May 31 they
will raise the benchmark interest rate from 1 percent
“eventually” with the economy reaching full output next year.  “The drop in the unemployment rate helps  consumer
confidence ,” said  Jonathan Basile , a senior economist at Credit
Suisse in  New York , by telephone. “It’s good to see the private
sector add” jobs as well, he said.  Employment at private companies grew by 37,100 and public-
sector employment declined by 44,300, the statistics agency
said.  GlaxoSmithKline Plc will create 70 new jobs in Ontario as
it expands a factory in Mississauga, the provincial government
 said  yesterday.  ‘Best Records’  The Canadian dollar recovered losses after the report. The
currency traded for 97.25 cents versus the U.S. currency at 9:31
a.m. in Toronto from 97.30 cents late yesterday, after trading
as weak as 97.63 cents. One Canadian dollar buys $1.02785.  The yield on the December bankers acceptance contract, a
barometer for short-term rate expectations, rose to 1.49 percent
from 1.48 percent yesterday. It has fallen from a peak of 1.99
percent on April 11 as investors scaled back bets on a  Bank of
Canada  rate increase.  The report compares with the U.S., where the Labor
Department said June 3 from  Washington  that the jobless rate
unexpectedly rose to 9.1 percent as payrolls grew at the slowest
rate in eight months, showing employers are losing confidence as
the world’s largest economy slows.  “Our economy has one of the best records in the area of
 job creation  in comparison with other industrialized countries
and this is why we will continue to keep our taxes low,” Prime
Minister Stephen Harper told lawmakers on June 8. His
 Conservative Party  was elected May 2 with a majority in the
House of Commons after campaigning on a message of economic
stability.  Full-time Work  Full-time work increased by 32,900 in May and part-time
work fell by 10,600,  Statistics Canada  said today. Self-
employment increased by 29,500, while paid employment fell by
7,300.  By industry, retail and wholesale companies led the
increase with 34,400 new jobs in May.  Education employment fell by 26,800 and manufacturing
declined by 22,500, Statistics Canada said.  “On balance, the details are softer than the headline,”
said  Derek Holt , vice president of economics at Bank of Nova
Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit in Toronto. “The qualities of jobs
created here are softer than what one may think.”  Average hourly wages rose 2 percent in May from a year ago,
compared with a 2.5 percent pace in April. “What matters to the
Bank of Canada the most is wage growth decelerated,” Holt said.  Statistics Canada said in a separate report today that
labor productivity rose 0.4 percent between January and March,
less than half the pace forecast by economists, as much of the
country’s output growth in the first quarter came from an
increase in hours worked.  To contact the reporter on this story:
