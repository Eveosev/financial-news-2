Tea production in Malawi,  Africa â€™s
largest grower of the leaves after  Kenya , slumped to 7 percent
in May from a year earlier, the Tea Association of Malawi said.  Output declined to 4.0 million kilograms compared with 4.3
million kilograms in the same period last year, the Blantyre-
based agency said in an e-mailed report today. The southern
African nation earned 1.1 billion kwacha between January and
April from tea exports, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
