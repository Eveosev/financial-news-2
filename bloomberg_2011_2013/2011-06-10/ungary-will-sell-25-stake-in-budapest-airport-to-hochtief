Hungary will sell its 25 percent
stake in Budapest Airport Zrt. to  Germany ’s  Hochtief AG (HOT) , which
leads a group that owns the remainder of the equity, the
National Development Ministry said.  The government will call its option to sell the stake,
valued at about 36.6 billion forint ($200 million), to Hochtief
by the June 18 deadline set when the majority of the equity was
sold in 2005, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  Hochtief’s Hungarian unit owns 37.7 percent of the airport.  To contact the reporter on this story:
