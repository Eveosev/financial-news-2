Russia ’s Micex Index snapped four
days of gains as oil slipped amid speculation fuel demand will
falter as Asia’s central banks raise interest rates to curb
inflation and the U.S. job market weakens.  The 30-stock Micex gauge retreated 0.3 percent to 1,686.52
by 3:38 p.m. in Moscow, erasing an earlier advance of as much as
0.4 percent and paring the weekly gain to 3.3 percent. OAO
Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil producer, slid 0.8 percent. OAO
Gazprom, the natural gas export monopoly, and OAO Sberbank,
Russia’s biggest lender, dropped 1.7 percent and 0.4 percent,
respectively. The dollar-denominated RTS Index declined 0.7
percent to 1,927.031.  Crude, Russia’s main export revenue earner, slumped in  New
York , trimming a weekly gain, after the  Bank of Korea  raised its
benchmark interest rate the third time this year and a a report
yesterday showed jobless claims unexpectedly increased in the
U.S. Oil slid to as low as $100.81 per barrel and last traded
down 1 percent at $100.96.  To contact the reporter on this story:
