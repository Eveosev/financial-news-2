Empresas La Polar SA (LAPOLAR)  rebounded from
yesterday’s record decline after the Chilean retailer said loan-
loss provisions don’t affect its business model and some
analysts said the company may be an acquisition target.  La Polar climbed 9.5 percent to 1,480 pesos at 10:35 a.m.
New York time. It tumbled 42 percent yesterday when the company
announced irregular lending practices that may require $427
million in additional provisions.  La Polar said in a statement after the close of trading
yesterday that the credit irregularities don’t affect its
business model and the company remains committed to growing in
Chile and  Colombia . Santiago-based brokerage Euroamerica
Corredores de Bolsa SA recommends “holding on to the stock
considering the potential upside in the case there’s a
takeover,” analysts Ximena Garcia and Marcelo Barrero wrote in
a note to clients yesterday.  “The fall yesterday was too violent and the stock will go
through a period of volatility,” said German Guerrero, director
of Santiago-based brokerage MBI Corredores de Bolsa SA. “The
market is taking into account that La Polar is still an ongoing
business that will create value and there is also speculation
that somebody may now want to buy it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
