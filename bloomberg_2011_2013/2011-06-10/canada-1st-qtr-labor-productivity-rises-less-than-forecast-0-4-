Canadian labor productivity rose 0.4
percent between January and March, less than half the pace
forecast by economists, as much of the country’s output growth
in the first quarter came from increases in hours worked.  Business output rose 1.2 percent and hours worked increased
by 0.7 percent from the previous quarter,  Statistics Canada  said
today in Ottawa. Economists predicted the productivity measure
would increase 0.9 percent, based on the median of 13 estimates
in a Bloomberg survey.  Productivity is a measure of how much an employee produces
in an hour of work, and lower efficiency limits how fast an
economy can grow without sparking inflation. Bank of Canada
Governor  Mark Carney  has said companies need to use a rising
currency to boost investment and regain competitiveness lost to
a global recession and emerging-market rivals.  Unit labor costs rose 0.6 percent in the first quarter,
Statistics Canada’s report said.  Measured in U.S. dollars, unit labor costs rose 3.3 percent
as the Canadian dollar strengthened 2.7 percent against its U.S.
counterpart. U.S. unit labor costs rose by 0.4 percent between
January and March, according to Statistics Canada.  The agency today also reduced its estimate of the fourth-
quarter productivity gain to 0.3 percent from 0.5 percent.  Labor productivity was 0.7 percent higher in the first
quarter than the same period a year earlier, the slowest annual
rate since the third quarter of 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
