France Telecom SA (FTE)  won a license for
900-megahertz radio spectrum in  Spain , while  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) ’s
Spanish mobile-phone unit won three 1,800-MHz licenses in
uncontested auctions for their frequency blocks.  France’s largest wireless operator pledged to invest 433
million euros ($626 million) in mobile infrastructure, Spain’s
Industry Ministry said in a  statement  today.  France Telecom  paid
126 million euros to the Spanish treasury under the conditions
of sale. Xfera Moviles SA, which operates under the Yoigo brand
and is owned by Stockholm-based TeliaSonera, paid 42 million
euros for its licenses and promised to invest 300 million euros.
All the licenses run through 2030.  France Telecom’s Orange unit in Spain had 20.23 percent of
the mobile market in  April , while Yoigo had 4.56 percent,
 Telefonica SA (TEF)  had 41.34 percent and Vodafone Group Plc had 28.6
percent, according to Spain’s telecommunications market
commission.  France Telecom Chief Executive Officer Stephane Richard is
looking to emerging markets, new technologies and possible asset
sales to revitalize the Paris-based company in advance of the
entry of a fourth mobile operator, Iliad SA, in the French
market next year. France Telecom may also sell its minority
stakes in operators in Austria and Portugal as part of a review
of its European assets.  To meet increased competition, France Telecom said May 31
it plans about 18.5 billion euros of global capital expenditure
for 2011 to 2013, and is targeting 45 billion euros in
cumulative earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization in the period, with growth in revenue and profit to
follow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
