There are “plenty” of reasons to
own gold and some people and central banks are underinvested in
the metal, said Dennis Stattman, a  fund manager  at  BlackRock
Inc. (BLK)   Stattman spoke with Erik Schatzker from the 2011
Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago yesterday on
Bloomberg Television’s “InsideTrack.” He said gold accounts
for about 5 percent of his holdings.  “While we’re still positive on gold, we’ve done a little
hedging of our gold position.  ‘‘There are plenty of good reasons to own gold. The
opportunity cost for holding gold is the foregone interest on a
fixed income security. With the Federal Reserve holding short
rates at zero, that’s not much of an opportunity cost.  ‘‘Western individuals and eastern central banks own very,
very little gold. They’re underinvested. There’s also very
little gold in the world. When they buy, they’re going to drive
up the price.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
