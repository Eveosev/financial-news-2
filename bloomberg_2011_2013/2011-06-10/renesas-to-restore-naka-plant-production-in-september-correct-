Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723) , the
world’s largest maker of microcontrollers used in cars and
mobile phones, will restore its output level of the chips
previously made at its Naka plant by using other factories by
the end of September.  The company earlier expected production to recover by
October, according to a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today. Renesas halted production at the plant after a record
earthquake in  Japan  on March 11.  Renesas, based in Kawasaki, Japan, halted production at its
Naka plant in Ibaraki prefecture after the nation’s record
earthquake damaged the factory, which makes 200-millimeter and
300-millimeter chips for cars and electronics. That forced
carmakers to shut down their own production for several weeks.  The company’s shares gained 0.6 percent to 722 yen at the
close of trading in  Tokyo  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
