Gasoline slipped and oil sank below
$100 after a report that  Saudi Arabia  will boost July output
following a meeting June 8 in Vienna at which OPEC ministers
failed to reach consensus on production quotas.  Futures fell as Saudi Arabia will raise production, though
it is too early to say by how much, according to a Saudi
industry official with knowledge of the matter. Al-Hayat
newspaper reported that the world’s largest oil producer will
increase output to 10 million barrels a day.  “That’s a very bearish thing,” said Dominick Chirichella,
senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York.
“The Saudis are saying to OPEC they can afford to have lower
 oil prices . They’re the only ones that have the capability to
bring the market down.”  Gasoline for July delivery sank 2.21 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to settle at $3.0177 a gallon on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. The fuel gained 0.8 percent this week.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
accounts for 40 percent of the world’s oil supply, has not
increased output quotas since 2007. The production limit has
been unchanged since December 2008, when it was capped at 24.845
million barrels a day for all members except  Iraq .  Crude oil for July delivery dropped $2.64, or 2.6 percent,
to $99.29 a barrel on the exchange.  Crack Spreads  The premiums for heating oil and gasoline over West Texas
Intermediate crude widened as  Brent crude  increased to a record
$19.49 a barrel over WTI. Product futures are vulnerable to
changes in Brent because refineries on the U.S. East Coast
process oil grades that are sold relative to the European
benchmark.  “The more accurate way to look at our market today is the
relationship to Brent,” said Mark Anderle, a trader at Truman
Arnold Cos. in Texarkana,  Texas . “The relative strength of
Brent correlates to product strength.”  The July gasoline crack spread on Nymex widened $1.71 to
$27.45 a barrel and heating oil increased $1.26 to $31.12 a
barrel, the widest gap since Feb. 16.  Regular gasoline at the pump fell 1.1 cents to $3.723
yesterday, according to AAA data on its website.  Futures also slid as the dollar advanced 1.2 percent versus
the euro as of 3:58 p.m. in New York, reducing the investment
appeal of commodities. The U.S. currency, which jumped 2.3
percent in three days, rose as the cost of insuring Greek and
Portuguese debt reached record highs amid continuing concern
over  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “You’re seeing tensions over  Greece  going into the weekend
and that’s never good for the euro,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  Stocks Drop  U.S. equities headed for a sixth weekly decline. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
slipped 1.4 percent.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index declined 0.8
percent, with 12 of 19 commodities declining.  “You have a much higher dollar, equity markets are all
down,” aid Ray Carbone, president of Paramount Options Inc. in
New York and a broker at the Nymex. ‘There’s a pullback even in
the precious metals. It’s not a good day for commodities in
general.”  Heating oil for July delivery dropped 3.27 cents, or 1
percent, to settle at $3.1051 a gallon. Prices rose 1.6 percent
this week. Heating oil’s premium to gasoline narrowed to 8.74
cents a gallon from 9.8 cents yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
