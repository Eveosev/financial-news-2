U.K. stocks dropped to a 2 1/2-month
low, led by selloff in mining companies as concern the global
economy is slowing hurt metal prices and Eurasian Natural
Resources Corp. was reported to have lost a third director.  ENRC, a producer of metals in  Kazakhstan , tumbled 7
percent.  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  retreated 5.4 percent after the world’s
third-largest platinum producer cut its sales guidance.
 AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  slid 2.1 percent after Barclays Plc downgraded
Britain’s second-biggest drugmaker.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  sank 90.54, or 1.6 percent, to
5,765.8 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge has fallen
for three consecutive weeks as U.S. economic data trailed
forecasts, adding to speculation the economic recovery is
faltering. The FTSE All-Share Index slid 1.5 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index fell 1.3 percent.  “Sentiment is not great the moment,” said Kishan Mandalia, a sales trader at  City Index  in London. “The dollar
is gaining ground which is pushing commodity prices lower and is
weighing massively on the miners. In the short term we could see
a bounce from here as a lot of the heavy selling has been
done.”  A report today showed U.K. manufacturing fell more than
economists forecast in April, dropping 1.5 percent from the
previous month. That was the most since January 2009. The median
economist forecast was for a 0.1 percent decline.  ENRC, which earlier in the week voted against rehiring
independent directors Richard Sykes and Kenneth Olisa, retreated
7.5 percent to 742 pence.  ENRC Report  The Financial Times reported that Mehmet Dalman, also an
independent director, is resigning his seat on the board over
concerns about corporate governance at the company. The
newspaper cited two people close to the situation.  Lonmin declined 5.4 percent to 1,460 pence after the
company said it has reduced its sales guidance for the 12 months
to Sept. 30 to about 720,000 ounces of platinum.  UBS AG rated the platinum producer a “sell” in new
coverage with a 12-month price estimate of 1,500 pence.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  lost 3.3 percent to 2,891 pence as
copper fell for a third day in  New York  and gold tumbled the
most in four weeks. Vedanta Resources Plc slid 3.3 percent to
1,977 pence and Xstrata Plc fell 2.3 percent to 1,333 pence.  AstraZeneca fell 2.1 percent to 3,108 pence after Barclays
lowered its recommendation for the drugmaker to “underweight”
from “overweight,” citing concerns about Crestor, the
company’s best-selling medicine last year.  Crestor Share  “We believe that Crestor’s market share is weakening in
the U.S,” analysts wrote in a report to clients today. “With
the decline expected to steepen through 2012, our earnings per
share estimates are 7 percent below consensus in 2013.”  Home Retail Group Plc (HOME)  retreated 5.2 percent to 165.5 pence,
extending its selloff this week to 22 percent. The retailer
yesterday said a slump in first-quarter sales of televisions and
video games led the company to cut the annual revenue forecast
for its U.K. Argos chain.  Hays Plc (HAS)  rallied 2.9 percent to 109.2 pence after the  Daily
Mail  reported that Adecco SA may be preparing a cash bid of 2.2
billion pounds ($3.6 billion), or 160 pence per share. The
newspaper didn’t say where it got the information.  Stephan Howeg, a spokesman for Glattbrugg, Switzerland-
based Adecco, reiterated the world’s largest supplier of
temporary workers may spend as much as 150 million euros ($217
million) on “bolt-on” acquisitions.  Bellway jumped 2.7 percent to 716 pence after the second-
worst performing U.K. homebuilder in the past 12 months said
sales and visitor levels rose as demand increased in and around
 London . Weekly sales in the four months through May rose 9
percent from a year earlier while average prices gained 4
percent.  -- With assistance from Julie Cruz in London. Editor: Andrew Rummer  To contact the reporter on this story:
