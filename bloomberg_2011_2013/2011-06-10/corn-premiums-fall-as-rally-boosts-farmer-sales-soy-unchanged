Cash premiums for corn shipped in
June to terminals near  New Orleans  fell relative to Chicago
futures as U.S. farmers boosted sales and demand ebbed. Soybeans
bids were unchanged.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 61 cents a bushel above July futures, down from 63
cents to 65 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data 
show. Yesterday, the average cash price rose to a record $8.495.
Today, the soybean basis was 75 cents to 80 cents a bushel above
July futures.  “We are at record highs and that has boosted farmer sales
and slowed demand for corn,” said  Dave Marshall , a farm-
marketing adviser for Toay Commodity Futures Group LLC in
Nashville,  Illinois . “We are getting closer to rationing
tightening supplies each day the markets move higher.”  Corn futures for July delivery rose 1.5 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $7.87 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price reached a record $7.9975. The contract has
doubled in the past 12 months.  Soybean futures for July delivery fell 6.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $13.8725 a bushel, the second straight decline. The
contract has climbed 50 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
