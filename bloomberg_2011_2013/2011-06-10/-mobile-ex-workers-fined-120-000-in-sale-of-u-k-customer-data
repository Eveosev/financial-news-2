Two former employees of  Deutsche
Telekom AG (DTE) ’s U.K. T-Mobile unit were ordered to pay fines
totaling 73,700 pounds ($120,000) for selling customer data to a
third party, Britain’s privacy regulator said.  T-Mobile discovered the theft in 2008 and went to the
authorities, resulting in guilty pleas from both men last year,
the U.K.  Information Commissioner’s Office  said in a statement.
The men, who appeared in court today in Chester,  England , face
as many as 18 months in prison if they fail to pay the fines
within six months, the regulator said.  The investigation “exposed the criminals behind a mass
illegal trade in lucrative mobile phone contract information,”
Commissioner Christopher Graham said in the statement. The data
included names, addresses and phone numbers, he said.  The case is the ICO’s biggest criminal probe into illegal
sales of customer data, and the first time it is confiscating
money obtained through a crime. The ICO is investigating privacy
issues including Sony Corp.’s loss of customer data to hackers
and Facebook Inc.’s face-recognition software for tagging
friends in pictures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
