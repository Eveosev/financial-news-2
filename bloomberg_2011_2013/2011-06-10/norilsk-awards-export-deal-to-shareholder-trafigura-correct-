(Corrects story published June 9 to show Trafigura is Dutch
in first paragraph.)  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel,  Russia ’s
largest mining company, awarded Trafigura Beheer BV a metals
export contract, the first for the Dutch commodities trader
since it bought an 8 percent stake in the producer last year.  “It’s a small export contract in  Southeast Asia ,” Norilsk
Chief Executive Officer Vladimir Strzhalkovsky said yesterday in
an interview in Moscow, declining to elaborate.  Norilsk, the world’s biggest nickel and palladium producer,
sold the stake to the second-largest industrial-metals trader in
December after rejecting an offer by Glencore International AG,
a rival of Trafigura, to take over the miner’s nickel sales.  Glencore owns 9 percent of United Co. Rusal, an aluminum
producer embroiled in a battle for control of Norilsk with the
nickel producer’s management and billionaire  Vladimir Potanin .
The trading company handled 38 percent of Rusal’s sales, the
world’s biggest aluminum producer said in its annual report.  Mikhail Zeldovich, Trafigura’s chief in Russia, didn’t pick
up when Bloomberg News called his mobile phone seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
