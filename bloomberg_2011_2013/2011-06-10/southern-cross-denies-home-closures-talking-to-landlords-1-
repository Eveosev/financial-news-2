Southern Cross  Healthcare Group Plc,
the U.K’s largest care home operator, denied reports that it had
decided to close some homes because of financial difficulties.  “No residents will find themselves homeless or without
care,” the Darlington, northern England-based company said in a
statement today. “Everyone involved in the restructuring
process is, and remains, committed to the continuity of quality
care for all of our 31,000 residents.”  Southern Cross, which wants a four-month moratorium on its
rental payments to help avoid collapse, remains in discussions
with its landlords and banks, it said in the statement. The
company is looking to axe 3,000 jobs by October from its
workforce of 44,000 employees, Southern Cross said June 8.  Southern Cross plans to hand 132 homes back to landlords by
the end of September, the Financial Times said earlier today,
citing company documents circulated to landlords.  The shares were down 0.2 pence, or 3.9 percent, to 4.9
pence at 2:31 p.m. in  London , extending the decline over the
past year to 89 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
