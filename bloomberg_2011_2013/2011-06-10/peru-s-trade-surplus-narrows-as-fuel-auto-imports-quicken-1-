Peru’s trade surplus narrowed in
April as imports accelerated on demand for crude oil, mobile
phones and automobiles, and export growth slowed.  The Andean country posted a trade surplus of $348 million
in April compared with $871 million in March and $516 million a
year ago, the National Statistics Institute said today in an e-
mailed report.  Imports rose 37 percent from a year earlier to $2.94
billion, the agency said. Exports increased 23 percent to $3.29
billion, after rising 30 percent in March, fueled by shipments
of fishmeal, iron and natural gas.  Peru’s sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7639 at 12:10 p.m. New
York time, from 2.7621 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
