Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  proposed allotting free land to rural families with at
least three children.  A land reform scheduled to start July 1 envisages the
withdrawal from owners of farmland left uncultivated for at
least three years, Putin also said today at a rural congress in
the Mordovia region of the Volga Federal District.  “I ask you to speed up preparation of the government order
which will identify criteria for unused agricultural land,” he
said.  Russia  has about 24 million hectares (59 million acres) of
undistributed arable land that should be sold at below-market
prices to people already working there, Putin said in March.
That’s an area almost as large as the U.K.  “All undistributed agricultural lands should be offered to
agricultural producers and farmers, who in fact work on those
lands, on a priority basis,” the prime minister said today.
Purchase prices should be discounted to 15 percent of registered
value, and no land should be given to speculators, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
