European stocks tumbled, with the
benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index falling for the seventh time in
eight days to the lowest level in 2 1/2 months, amid concern
about the strength of the economy.  Sulzer AG (SUN)  slumped 5 percent as the Swiss pumpmaker said
Chief Executive Officer Ton Buechner will leave to join  Akzo
Nobel NV. (AKZA)   Hermes International (RMS)  SCA sank 4.8 percent as  LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  said it doesn’t intend to make a
takeover bid.  Total SA (FP) , Europe’s third-largest oil company, fell
1.7 percent as crude plunged.  The Stoxx 600 slid 1.3 percent to 268.13 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London, extending this week’s drop to 2 percent. All 19
industry groups declined. The gauge has lost 4.6 percent this
month, falling to the lowest level since March 18, as reports on
U.S. employment and factory orders added to concern that the
economy is faltering.  “There’s a lot of bearish sentiment around the macro
environment that’s eating away at risk appetite,” said  Henk Potts , an equity strategist at Barclays Wealth in London, which
oversees $239 billion.  The 7.9 percent slump from this year’s high on Feb. 17 has
dragged the Stoxx 600’s valuation to about 12.8 times its
companies’ reported earnings, near the cheapest since 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  National benchmark indexes declined in all of the 18
western European markets today. Germany’s DAX fell 1.3 percent,
while France’s CAC 40 retreated 1.9 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100
dropped 1.6 percent.  German Economy  Stocks briefly pared losses this morning as the Bundesbank
raised its forecasts for German growth, saying  Europe ’s largest
economy has entered a broad and prolonged upswing.  Gross domestic product will expand 3.1 percent this year
and 1.8 percent in 2012, the Frankfurt-based central bank said
in its bi-annual economic outlook. That compares with a February
prediction by then Bundesbank President Axel Weber of 2.5
percent growth for this year and a December forecast of 1.5
percent for 2012.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  stepped up his
calls for bondholders to assume a “fair” share of further
Greek aid, setting Europe’s biggest economy on a collision
course with the  European Central Bank .  In a speech to parliament in Berlin evoking the spirit of
German unity and European integration, Schaeuble appealed to
lawmakers to back a second bailout for  Greece  to ensure a stable
euro and bolster the global economy. In return, “we have to
insist on the participation of the private sector,” he said.  Chinese Surplus  China reported a less-than-estimated $13.1 billion  trade
surplus  in May, as surging imports signaled the nation’s demand
may support global growth while adding pressure for higher
interest rates. Inbound shipments climbed 28 percent from a year
earlier and exports rose 19 percent, the customs bureau said on
its website. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
23 economists was for a $19.3 billion surplus.  In the U.K., a report showed manufacturing output fell more
than forecast in April. Factory output contracted 1.5 percent
after rising 0.2 percent in March, the  Office for National
Statistics  said. Economists were predicting a 0.1 percent drop,
according to the median of 24 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Sulzer retreated 5 percent to 138.80 Swiss francs, a two-
month low, after saying Buechner is leaving to replace Hans Wijers as chief executive of Akzo Nobel. Akzo shares slipped 1.2
percent to 47.88 euros.  Hermes, LVMH  Hermes sank 4.8 percent to 182.70 euros, the biggest drop
this year. A spokesman for LVMH said the world’s largest maker
of  luxury goods  does not intend to bid for Hermes, the bag maker
in which it holds a 20.2 percent stake.  Total declined 1.7 percent to 38 euros and  BP Plc (BP/)  dropped
1.8 percent to 442.05 pence. Crude tumbled the most in four
weeks in New York after al-Hayat newspaper reported that Saudi
Arabia will raise oil production to 10 million barrels a day
next month.  Rio Tinto Group slid 2.3 percent to 4,104 pence as a gauge
of mining stocks was the biggest decliner in the Stoxx 600.
Australia’s Treasury said a planned 30 percent tax on profit
from coal and iron ore at companies including  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) 
and Rio Tinto will be introduced to parliament in the next six
months. BHP lost 1.9 percent to 2,279.5 pence today.  ENRC Slides  Eurasian Natural Resources Corp., which earlier in the week
voted against rehiring independent directors Richard Sykes and
Kenneth Olisa, retreated 7.5 percent to 742 pence, the lowest
since July 2009.  The Financial Times reported that Mehmet Dalman, also an
independent director, is resigning his seat on the board over
concerns about corporate governance at the company. The
newspaper cited two people close to the situation.  Hays Plc (HAS)  rallied 2.9 percent to 109.2 pence, the largest
gain since April, after the Daily Mail reported that  Adecco SA (ADEN) 
may be lining up a 160 pence-per-share cash bid for the biggest
U.K. recruitment company.  Stephan Howeg, a spokesman for Adecco, reiterated the
world’s largest supplier of temporary workers may spend as much
as 150 million euros ($217 million) on “bolt-on” acquisitions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
