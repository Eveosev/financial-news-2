Anita Gandhi, director at Arihant
Capital Market Ltd., comments from Mumbai on the outlook for
Indian stocks.  India ’s industrial production growth eased in April, a
slowdown that has yet to curb pressure on the  Reserve Bank  of
India to raise  interest rates  to damp inflation.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. fell for a third day, dropping 0.5 percent. The gauge
slid 3.3 percent in May, the most since January.  On the market outlook:  “Markets are lackluster, reflecting the economic slowdown.
Volumes drying up is an indication that the markets are
bottoming out. Foreign funds are also showing minuscule
activity. We expect volumes to pick up in a month as and when
there is clarity on policy and the progress of the monsoon. With
good rainfall, inflation will come down and that will have a
positive impact on stocks. Deferring a diesel price hike will
increase problems for oil marketing companies.”  On industrial production:  “Industrial production numbers were overall disappointing.
Only manufacturing has shown a slight improvement. The
government may take a cue from the numbers and expedite its
policy initiatives. The government should grant fast approval
for pending infrastructure projects.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
