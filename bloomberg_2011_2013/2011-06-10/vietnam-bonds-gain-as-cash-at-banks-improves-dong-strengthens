Vietnam ’s five-year bond yields
dropped the most in a year on speculation banks are putting more
funds into debt after a central bank order to cut lending.  Commercial lenders must limit loans to “non-production
businesses” such as those investing in the stock and property
markets to 22 percent of total lending by June 30 and 16 percent
by year-end, the  State Bank  of Vietnam said in a March 1
statement. The government in February cut its credit-growth
target to less than 20 percent this year from the original 23
percent.  “Demand for the securities has increased,” said Vu Anh Duc, a Hanoi-based senior dealer at Vietnam Bank for Industry
and Trade, also known as Vietinbank. “Commercial banks now have
good liquidity but since they aren’t allowed to boost lending
then they turn to bonds.”  The yields fell 26 basis points, or 0.26 percentage point,
to 12.72 percent, the most since June 2010, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong strengthened 0.02 percent to 20,550 per dollar as
of 4:39 p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled
by Bloomberg.  The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,618 today,
compared with 20,623 yesterday, its website showed. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the
official rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
