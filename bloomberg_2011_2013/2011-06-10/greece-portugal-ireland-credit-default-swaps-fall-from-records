The cost of insuring against default
on government debt sold by  Greece ,  Portugal  and Ireland rose to
records, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on Greece soared 45.5 basis points to 1,567.5,
Portugal increased 11 to 730 and Ireland jumped 20 to 710 as of
4 p.m. in London, according to CMA. The Markit iTraxx SovX
Western Europe Index of swaps on 15 governments climbed 10 basis
points to 211.5, the highest since Jan. 11.  Swaps on  Spain  rose 14 basis points to 275, Italy increased
9 basis points to 174 and Belgium was up 8 at 153 basis points,
according to CMA. France rose 5 basis points to 275. An increase
signals deterioration in investor perceptions of  credit quality .  The cost of insuring corporate debt also increased. The
Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps on 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings jumped 11 basis point to 401,
while the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 investment-grade
companies rose 3 basis points to 108.75, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps linked to the
senior debt of 25 European banks and insurers rose 7.5 basis
points to 167.5 and the subordinated index soared 11 to 288,
JPMorgan prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt for five years is
equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value
in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
