Kenyan exporters and importers would
be “better cushioned” by a shilling exchange rate of between
80 shillings to 85 shillings per dollar, Reuters said, citing
Ministry of Finance Permanent Secretary Joseph Kinyua.  The East African nation doesn’t want “too strong” a
currency, the  news agency  reported Kinyua as saying. The country
won’t issue foreign bonds in the year through June because it
has already secured the funds from a range of lenders, it said.
Most of the funds will come from the  World Bank  and the African
Development bank, whose loans will be at a concessionary rate of
0.5 percentage point over 30 to 40 years with a 10-year grace
period, Reuters reported.  The nation will work on its debut Eurobond of $500 million
this fiscal year and plans to issue the debt in fiscal 2013, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
