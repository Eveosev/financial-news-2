Soybeans fell for a second day in
 Chicago  on concern a prediction for higher-than-estimated U.S.
stockpiles at the end of the marketing year may signal weaker
demand from importers.  Soybean inventories will total 180 million bushels (4.9
million metric tons) on Aug. 31, up 5.9 percent from a May
forecast, as U.S. exports decline amid a record South American
crop, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said. Stockpiles before
the 2012 harvest will total 190 million bushels, up from 160
million estimated last month, it said in a report yesterday.  “The USDA raised U.S. soybean ending stocks for 2010-11
and 2011-12 crop years,” Rabobank International analysts said
in a report today. “The change was due to lower exports than in
their May WASDE report. This was largely due to a lowering of
their forecast for Chinese imports,” the analysts said,
referring to the USDA’s World Agriculture Supply and Demand
Estimates.  Soybeans for November delivery slid 9 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $13.7775 a bushel by 10:30 a.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The oilseed has dropped 1.8 percent this
year, partly on speculation growers may switch from corn to
soybeans after wet weather delayed grain sowing. Soybeans can be
planted later in the season than corn.  U.S. exporters will ship 1.54 billion bushels of soybeans
in the current marketing year, down from 1.55 billion projected
in May, the USDA said. It estimated exports in the following
period at 1.52 billion bushels, down from 1.54 billion forecast
in May.  Corn for July delivery fell 1.5 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
$7.84 a bushel, paring a 7.3 percent climb over the prior three
sessions. The grain has advanced 25 percent this year.  Wheat for July delivery lost 4.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$7.405 a bushel. The grain is down 6.8 percent this year.
Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris declined 4.50 euros, or 1.9 percent, to 231 euros ($335) a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
