When Martha Dodd met Rudolf Diels in
Hitler’s Berlin, she was immediately smitten by the “cruel,
broken beauty” of the Gestapo chief.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Dodd liked calling him “dearie” in public and got a
special thrill from the fact that everyone else was terrified at
the sight of him.  Not politically biased, she also bedded Boris Winogradov, a
spy for the NKVD, the Soviet secret police.  A flirtatious, lively blonde, Dodd was 24 years old when
her scholarly father, William Dodd, was appointed America’s
first ambassador to Hitler’s  Germany . Quickly dumping her banker
husband, she packed her bags and became an eyewitness to the
early days of the  Third Reich .  Dodd launched herself into diplomatic life with alacrity,
and had affairs with everyone from Hitler’s close confidante
Putzi Hanfstaengl to flying ace Ernst Udet, who took her falcon
hunting with Hermann Goring. Other conquests included novelist
Thomas Wolfe and Max Delbruck, a biophysicist who won the  Nobel
Prize .  More importantly, she made sure her father’s diaries saw
the light of day.  I spoke with Erik Larson, author of “In the Garden of the
Beasts,” on the following topics:  1. Ambassador Dodd  2. Diplomatic Circles  3. Sex and Torture  4. Warnings Ignored  5. Night of the Long Knives  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
