B2W Cia. Global do Varejo fell after
 Brazil ’s Justice Ministry requested information on delays in
deliveries from the company’s online unit Americanas.com.  B2W, a unit of Brazil’s biggest discount retailer  Lojas
Americanas SA (LAME4) , has 10 days to provide information its
deliveries, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.
The ministry wants to find out if B2W goods are facing delays
across the country after the Rio de Janeiro-based company was
banned from selling products in its home state because of the
problems, according to the statement.  B2W declined 2.7 percent to 21.50 reais at the close of Sao
Paulo trading. The shares have retreated 31 percent this year,
compared with a 9.5 percent fall for the benchmark Bovespa
index.  “This could lead to a huge loss if they find delays in
other states,” Caue Pinheiro, an analyst with SLW Corretora,
said in a phone interview from  Sao Paulo , adding he didn’t know
whether the company had delays outside Rio. “They’d have to pay
a fine if they keep taking orders.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
