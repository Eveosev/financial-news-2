Norway’s Water Resources and Energy
Directorate issued a flood warning for large parts of the nation
due to heavy rainfall and melting snow in the mountains.  Large quantities of groundwater, combined with rain and
snowmelt, have also increased the risk of landslides, the Oslo-
based authority said  today  on its website. The warning is in
effect until June 13.  Areas affected include eastern and southern regions of
Hordaland, Sogn and Fjordane, Moere and Romsdal, Soer-
Troendelag, Oppland, Buskerud and  Hedmark , as well as Nordland
and Troms in the north.  People should stay clear of rivers and sports such as
canoeing, spokesman Arne Soeiland said by phone. “There is an
increased danger of erosion and landslides.”  The directorate will continue to monitor the situation, he
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
