Wigan coach Roberto Martinez
rejected an approach from  Aston Villa  and signed a contract
extension with his English Premier League soccer club.  Martinez was given permission to talk to Villa earlier this
month. He joined Wigan two years ago, and today signed a new
pact, the club said on its website without giving details.  Wigan finished 16th in the last season, two spots out of
the relegation zone. The club has been in the Premier League for
seven seasons.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
