the government’s 25 percent stake in Budapest Airport Zrt.,
according to a decree published in the official gazette  Magyar
Kozlony  today.  The sale will be managed by the National Development
Ministry, which can sell the stake without a tendering process,
according to the decree.  Germany ’s  Hochtief AG (HOT)  holds a majority stake in the
airport, which was privatized in 2005 and recently renamed Liszt
