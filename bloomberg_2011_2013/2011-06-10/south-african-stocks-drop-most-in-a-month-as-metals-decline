South African stocks fell, sending
the benchmark index to its biggest decline in a month, as the
retreat in copper and gold prices dragged metal producers lower.  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL) , the world’s largest mining company, and
 Anglo American Plc (AGL)  fell at least 2 percent. The FTSE/JSE Africa
All Share Index lost 1.5 percent to 31,164.35 at the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg, taking the weekly loss to 1.3 percent, a
second consecutive fall.  The All Share gauge erased this week’s gain today as
copper fell for a third day on a decline in imports by China,
the world’s largest consumer of the metal, and as gold dropped
the most in four weeks. Stocks in emerging markets declined
after South Korea raised  interest rates  and economic data from
China and India fueled concern profit growth may slow.  BHP Billiton  slipped to the lowest level since March 15,
sinking 2 percent to 251.90 rand. Anglo American, the
diversified miner that makes up 10 percent of the benchmark
 stock index , the lowest close since Dec. 2, losing 2.8 percent
to 320.15 rand. BHP and Anglo American account for more than 22
percent of the benchmark stock index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
