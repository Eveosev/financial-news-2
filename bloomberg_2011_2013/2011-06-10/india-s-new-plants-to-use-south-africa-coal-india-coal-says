New power plants in  India  may opt
for high-calorific value South African coal instead of lower
grade Indonesian supplies, India Coal Market Watch reported,
citing an unidentified official from a South African mining
company.  Supplies of the fuel in India are inadequate and there are
infrastructure issues, the industry newsletter said. The higher
energy content of South African coal enables utilities to import
less and tackle logistics concerns, it said. India Coal Market
Watch is published by Kolkata-based  mjunction Services Ltd. , an
online trading company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
