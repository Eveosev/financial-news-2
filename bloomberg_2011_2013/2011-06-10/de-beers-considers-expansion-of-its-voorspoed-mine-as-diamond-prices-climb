De Beers , the world’s largest
diamond producer, is considering an expansion of its South
African Voorspoed mine to extend the life of the operation by as
much as eight years as prices for the gems climb.  De Beers will complete a study this year on a proposed
expansion that would prolong the mine’s life to “2026 or
2028,” rather than 2020 as currently planned, Mine Manager
Mpumi Zikalala said today in an interview at the site near
Kroonstad. It’s too early to estimate the cost of the project,
which may include an underground section, she said.  De Beers plans to boost output to benefit from prices that
jumped 21 percent last quarter after two straight annual gains
of more than 30 percent, according to  WWW International Diamond
Consultants Ltd . Among the company’s Southern African projects,
Voorspoed is one of the smallest and produces the highest-value
diamonds including pink gems, which fetch a premium. The mine
reopened in 2008 at a cost of 1.3 billion rand ($190 million).  Voorspoed  produced 732,000 carats of De Beers’ total South
African output of 7.56 million carats last year. The project
will probably yield “just under 700,000 carats” this year as
workers mine areas with lower concentrates of diamonds, Zikalala
said, adding that output may approach 800,000 carats in 2012.  De Beers, producer of about 40 percent of the world’s rough
diamonds, posted 2010 net income of $546 million, compared with
a year-earlier loss $743 million. There’ll probably be a global
shortfall of the gems for the next five years, Chairman  Nicky Oppenheimer  said yesterday in a speech in  Washington .  The Oppenheimer family owns 40 percent of the Johannesburg-
based company. London-based  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  has 45 percent
and Botswana holds 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
