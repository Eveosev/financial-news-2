The Dallas Mavericks beat the Miami
Heat 112-103 to move within one win of securing their first
National Basketball Association title.  The Mavericks lead the NBA Finals by three games to two and
can wrap up the best-of-seven series with a Game 6 victory in
Miami on June 12. The Heat will also host a decider, if
necessary, two days later.  The Heat beat the Mavericks in six games in each teamâ€™s
only previous visit to the NBA Finals in 2006.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
