A U.S.-based investment fund is in
advanced talks to inject 1 billion euros ($1.45 billion) into
Spanish savings bank  Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM) ,  Abc 
reported, citing unidentified people in financial markets.  The fund is asking for a 55 percent discount to book value
which the bank may be willing to accept as it comes under
pressure to meet  capital requirements  set by the Bank of Spain,
the newspaper said.  Securing the 1 billion euro investment and the 1 billion
euros of aid from Spainâ€™s bank rescue fund will ensure that the
bank can avoid nationalisation, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
