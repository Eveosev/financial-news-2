David Lam, an analyst with Haitong
International Research Ltd. in  Hong Kong , comments on possible
cuts by China in value added tax and port charges on imported
coal as the country faces power shortages. China is the world’s
biggest coal consumer. Lam commented in a note today.  “China may trim the value-added tax and port charge on
imported coal to encourage more imports by downstream consumers.
This may help to improve supply in the southern and eastern
parts of the country. The VAT on imported coal currently stands
at 17 percent, while the port charge is around 35 yuan ($5.40) a
metric ton.”  “The cost difference between domestic and overseas
purchases in May was 138 yuan a ton. By our estimates, the gap
will narrow by 36 yuan a ton if the VAT eases from 17 percent to
13 percent, which should encourage more overseas purchases.” He
said he based the price comparison on Australian thermal coal
with a 6,300 kilocalorie energy content and material at  China ’s
Qinhuangdao port with 5,800 kilocalories.  “Rising imports by China may further push up the
international coal price. This may partially offset the cost
advantage following the VAT and port charge reduction. As such,
we believe the policy will have no significant impact on the
long-term trend of the domestic coal price. We expect annual
growth of at least 10 percent in the domestic coal price this
year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
