Renewable energy in the U.K. may
increase tenfold by 2030 if the country can improve its power
grids and provide training to the workforce, the Department of
Energy and Climate Change said.  Wind farms, solar panels and hydroelectricity could
generate more than 197,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2020
and 424,000 gigawatt-hours in 2030, compared with 50,000
gigawatt-hours last year, according to a  study  posted today on
the agency’s website. The U.K. produced a total of 354,000
gigawatt-hours of electricity from all sources in 2009, the most
recent year of data.  The European Union has set a target of deriving 15 percent
of its energy from renewable sources by 2020, and Prime Minister
 David Cameron  aims to make his government Britain’s “greenest”
ever.  “It is vital that our support for renewable electricity
both encourages investment and represents value for money for
consumers,” Energy Minister  Charles Hendry  said today in an e-
mailed statement.  If current constraints remain in place, the maximum
possible renewable electricity generation capacity in the U.K.
would be about 105,000 gigawatt-hours in 2020 and 220,000 in
2030, the report concluded. The government will use these
findings to shape energy policy decisions from 2013 through
2017, the agency said.  Report was prepared by the London-based engineering company
