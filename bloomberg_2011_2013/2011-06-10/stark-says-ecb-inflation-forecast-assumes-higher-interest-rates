European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said the “underlying assumption” of
the central bank’s latest inflation forecasts are “higher short
term interest rates.”  The ECB yesterday raised its inflation forecast for this
year to 2.6 percent from 2.3 percent predicted in March, and
left its estimate for 2012 at 1.7 percent. The Frankfurt-based
bank aims to keep inflation just below 2 percent.  “You shouldn’t forget that the underlying assumption is
higher short-term interest rates,” Stark told reporters in
 Frankfurt  today. When asked whether the bank’s unchanged
forecast for next year means that policy makers have less
pressure to act on interest rates, he said “the projections are
staff projections. We said that we see the risks to  price
stability  to the upside over the medium term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
