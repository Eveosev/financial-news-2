The  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said farmers who suffered losses tied to breached levees may
have to pay more to insure their crops in 2012.  Property flooded under such circumstances “ will likely be
considered high-risk land with potential premium rate increases
for the 2012 crop year until the levee is repaired and the land
is brought back to its former level of productivity,” the
department said today on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
