Hays Plc (HAS)  rose as much as 4.9 percent
in London trading after a report that  Adecco SA (ADEN)  may be preparing
a bid.  Adecco may be lining up a cash bid of 2.2 billion pounds
($3.6 billion), or 160 pence per share, the  Daily Mail  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Stephan Howeg, a spokesman for Glattbrugg, Switzerland-
based Adecco, declined to comment by phone. Chief Executive
Officer Patrick de Maeseneire said May 10 that the company had
150 million euros ($217 million) budgeted for acquisitions.  Hays shares were trading at 109.2 pence, up 2.9 percent, at
8:35 a.m. London time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
