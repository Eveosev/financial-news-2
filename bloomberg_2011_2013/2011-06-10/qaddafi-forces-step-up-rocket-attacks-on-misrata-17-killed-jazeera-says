Forces loyal to Libyan leader
 Muammar Qaddafi  launched their third assault in five days on
Misrata, killing at least 18 rebels as rockets landed closer to
the city than at any time in the past two weeks.  Several  pickup trucks  loaded with the bodies of rebel
fighters streamed into the city and ambulances arrived at
Misrata’s Hikma hospital with the wounded. In addition to the 18
dead, the hospital reported 55 injured as evening began.  Qaddafi followed the artillery bombardment with an infantry
assault that was repulsed, rebel fighters said. The rebel units
pushed 10 kilometers (6 miles) over the front line at the
village of Dafniya, near the western outskirts of the city, said
one of the fighters, Mohamed Khalid.  The attack on the rebel-held city came hours after the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization said it used U.K. Apache
helicopters to strike army and communications targets of
Qaddafi’s forces near Misrata overnight. The NATO operation
followed a request yesterday for Apache support from the rebels.  “We managed to take two tanks -- we captured them, then
blew them up,” Khalid said in an interview. He said his unit
saw the bodies of several of Qaddafi’s soldiers who had been
killed in the fighting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
