Refining margins from making naphtha
slumped this week as petrochemical plants shut in  Japan . Hin
Leong Trading Pte bought gasoil and sold jet fuel in Singapore.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to Japan rose
$19.75, or 2.1 percent, to $977.50 a metric ton, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to Brent, or the
crack spread, slumped to $77.64 a ton today from $94.66 at the
end of Asian trading on June 3. A Tonen Chemical Corp. naphtha
cracker was shut yesterday for a possible compressor problem and
may be off line for 10 days, the Nikkei newspaper reported.  Naphtha cargoes for delivery in the second half of July are
trading at a discount of $1 a ton to first-half August
shipments, Bloomberg data showed. That indicates weak demand for
prompt supplies.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline gained $5.30, or 4.5 percent this
week to $123.15 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data.
Gasoline’s premium to naphtha rose to $16.40 a barrel from
$13.40 on June 3. The wider reforming margin indicates it is
more profitable to turn naphtha into gasoline compared with a
week earlier.  Shutdowns at petrochemical plants for maintenance are
combining with closures in Japan after the March 11 earthquake
to sap Asian demand for naphtha, an oil product used for making
ethylene and blending into gasoline. About 200,000 tons of the
fuel loaded from  Europe  was shipped to  Asia  last month, compared
with 300,000 tons in April, a Bloomberg News survey of six
traders showed June 2.  Vitol Group bought two 50,000-barrel cargoes of 92-RON
gasoline for loading June 30 to July 4 at $123.10 a barrel,
traders said. Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. sold one of the cargoes
while Trafigura Beheer BV was the seller of the second.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur rose $4 this
week, or 3.1 percent, to $131.85 a barrel, according to
Bloomberg data. Jet fuel climbed $4.05, or 3.1 percent, from
last week to $132.85. Each product gained for a third week.  In Singapore, Hin Leong bought three 150,000-barrel cargoes
of 0.5 percent sulfur gasoil, bringing its purchases so far this
month to 2.35 million barrels, traders said. The  Singapore 
trader received a discount of 50 cents a barrel to benchmark
quotes from Trafigura Beheer and Barclays Plc, and a discount of
45 cents from Glencore International AG.  PetroChina Co. sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 10
parts-per-million of sulfur to BP Plc at $2.20 a barrel over
quotes, traders said. That’s the same premium as the two most
recent transactions for this grade, known as ultra-low-sulfur
diesel.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude advanced 76
cents this week to $21.29 a barrel at 6:27 p.m. Singapore time,
based on data from PVM Oil Associates, a broker.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil added 5 cents to 80 cents a
barrel, PVM said. This regrade rebounded 6.7 percent this week
after three weeks of losses, indicating it’s profitable to
produce  aviation fuel .  Hin Leong sold 150,000 barrels of jet fuel to BP at 30
cents a barrel below benchmark quotes, the smallest discount in
two weeks, traders said. The Singapore trader also sold 250,000
barrels to Vitol Group at 30 cents below average quotes for
June.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil climbed $18.75, or 2.8
percent, this week to $684.50 a ton, according to Bloomberg
data. The price of 380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as
marine fuel, rose $18, or 2.8 percent, from last week to
$673.50. Each variety gained for a third week.  In Singapore, PetroChina sold 20,000 tons of 380-centistoke
fuel oil to Vitol at $4.50 a ton over benchmark quotes, traders
said. That’s down from a $4.75 premium in yesterday’s
transactions.  Fuel oil ’s discount to Dubai crude was at $5.93 a barrel,
widening from $5.39 a week earlier, based on Bloomberg data.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was up $1 today at $11 a ton, Bloomberg data showed. This
viscosity spread rebounded 7.3 percent this week after two weeks
of losses, meaning bunkers have risen less than higher-quality
fuel oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
