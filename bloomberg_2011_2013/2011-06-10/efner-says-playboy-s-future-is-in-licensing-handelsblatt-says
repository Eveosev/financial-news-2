Hugh Hefner  said the future of
 Playboy Enterprises Inc. (PLA)  will be in licensing the brand and in
partnerships, according to an interview in  Handelsblatt .  Hefner said he wants to increase revenue from licensing to
clubs and casinos, for perfumes and movies, the newspaper said,
citing Hefner. He also plans to market his own wedding to
Crystal Harris and to target emerging markets like China,
according to the newspaper.  Hefner said that de-listing the company has provided more
flexibility and “more opportunities to bring a partner on
board,” without going into detail, Handelsblatt said.  Playboy Magazine is the “heart of the company,” and will
stay “for some time,” the newspaper quoted Hefner as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
