Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd., a Kenyan
retailer that resumed trading last week after a five-year
suspension due to bankruptcy, rose for the fourth day on
speculation it is undervalued relative to its peers on the
 Nairobi Stock Exchange .  The shares climbed 9.8 percent to 12.35 shillings by 12:50
p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, bringing its increase in the past
four days to 25 percent. Uchumi trades on a multiple of about 10
times reported earnings compared with a Kenyan market average of
13, Eric Musau, an analyst at Nairobi-based African Alliance
Securities Kenya Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  “We are seeing demand is higher than supply,” he said.
“People are seeing that it is good value to buy Uchumi.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
