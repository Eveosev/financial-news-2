Somalia’s interior minister,
Abdishakur Sheikh Hassan Farah, died after an attack in his home
in Mogadishu, the capital, by a female suicide bomber that a
police spokesman said was his niece.  The woman was at Farah’s house to discuss her education
when the bomb exploded, police Captain Hassan Mohamed said by
phone.  Al-Shabaab, a group the U.S. accuses of having links to al-
Qaeda, “successfully implemented” its mission to kill the
minister, Sheikh Abdikarim Abdullahi Yusuf, a commander with the
group, in, said in a telephone interview.  Farah was killed by an “anti-peace group,” said Information
Minister Abdikarim Jama, by phone today.  Somalia’s government has been battling Islamic insurgents,
including al-Shabaab, since 2007. The incident today is at least
the second apparent suicide bombing in two days, following an
attack on the port at Mogadishu that killed one civilian and
injured three African Union Mission for Somalia soldiers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
