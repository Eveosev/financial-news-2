European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  is “confident” a second financial aid package for
Greece will be ready by the end of June.  “We are working on additional European financial means for
Greece,” Van Rompuy told journalists today at the Russia-EU
summit in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. “We will reach an agreement
by the end of the month.”  Greece needs additional financing after EU leaders and
Prime Minister George Papandreou acknowledged the nation would
be unable to fulfill an original plan to return to markets in
2012. The latest aid package will include a “voluntary” role for
investors, Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said
June 3.  “We are also working on some form of private-sector
involvement,” Van Rompuy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
