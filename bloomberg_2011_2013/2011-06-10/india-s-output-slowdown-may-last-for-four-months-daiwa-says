 N. Sethuraman Iyer, chief
investment officer of Daiwa Asset Management  India  Pvt., which
manages about $179 million in assets, comments on Indian stocks
after the government released April industrial output numbers.  Output at factories, utilities and mines rose 6.3 percent
from a year earlier after an 8.8 percent gain in March, the
 Central Statistical Office  said in a statement in  New Delhi 
today.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
fell 0.4 percent to 18,310.49 at 12:10 p.m. in Mumbai.  “The slowdown may continue for another three to four
months, during which interest rates will likely peak. By the
second half, things should start looking up.  ‘‘Defensive stocks such as consumer staples and
pharmaceuticals are the best ones to be invested in. The
automobile sector will see pressure as the interest rate trims
demand and fuel prices are likely to rise further.  ‘‘It’s not degrowth. India is still in a growth phase, but
it is slowing down and it’s not a panic situation where
investors will exit any particular sector. Investors will look
at gradually trimming their holdings in sectors they are bearish
on.  ‘‘I don’t see interest rates cooling down very rapidly, as
inflation is likely to stay above the level the central bank is
comfortable with.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
