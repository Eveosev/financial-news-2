Bahrain  canceled a rescheduled
Formula One race after teams complained, citing travel
disruption and problems getting insurance.  The teams said the Oct. 30 event would cause an
“unacceptable degree of disruption and cost,” according to a
June 7 letter they sent to series ruling body  Federation
Internationale de l’Automobile . Bahrain also suspended the race
in March because of civil unrest in the Gulf state.  “It has been made clear that this fixture cannot progress
and we fully respect that decision,” Bahrain International
Circuit chairman Zayed Alzayani said on the racetrack website.
“We look forward to welcoming teams, their drivers and
supporters back to Bahrain next year.”  The Paris-based FIA had reinstated the race in the slot of
the Indian Grand Prix last week after a 36-hour fact-finding
mission found protests in Bahrain had subsided.  Human Rights Watch spokesman  Joe Stork  called the fact-
finders’ recommendation to hold the race “highly questionable”
because there remains evidence of repression in the country.
Avaaz, a New York-based online campaign group, collected more
than 450,000 signatures backing the cancellation of the race.  Bahrain is scheduled to host the first race of next season
in March at the $150 million circuit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
