Bellway Plc (BWY)  gained the most in more
than two months after the U.K. homebuilder said sales and
visitor numbers rose as demand increased in and around London.  The shares climbed 2.7 percent in London trading, the most
since April 1. Weekly sales in the four months through May
advanced 9 percent from a year earlier to 111 units, the
Newcastle, England-based company said today in a statement.
Average prices gained 4 percent to 182,000 pounds ($297,000).  “The way that sales are going at the moment reflects a
typical housing year as far as we’re concerned,” Finance
Director Alistair Leitch said in an interview. “We’ve had a
good spring selling season and then it quietens off during the
summer. We look forward to the autumn and hopefully it’ll
rebound again.”  The U.K.’s coalition government plans to help homebuilders
like Bellway increase the number of properties they build by
releasing enough state-owned land to develop as many as 100,000
unit. Britain faces a shortfall of about 1 million homes within
four years, with  London  worst affected, according to Savills
Plc.  Bellway advanced 19 pence to 716 pence, raising the
company’s market value to 865 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
