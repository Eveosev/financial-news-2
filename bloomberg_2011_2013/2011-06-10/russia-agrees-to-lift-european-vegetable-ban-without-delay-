Russia will lift its ban on imports
of fresh vegetables from the European Union after a deadly
outbreak of E. coli, President  Dmitry Medvedev  said after talks
with his EU counterparts.  The two sides agreed the ban will be lifted “without
delay” and as soon as they put in place a certification system,
EU Commission President  Jose Barroso  told reporters in the Volga
River city of Nizhny Novgorod today.  Russia suspended imports of German and Spanish tomatoes,
lettuce and cucumbers on May 30 after an E. coli outbreak led to
the deaths of at least 27 people. The ban was extended to all
fresh vegetables from the EU on June 2. Agriculture Minister
 Yelena Skrynnik  said June 8 the ban would remain in force until
the EU gave complete information about the outbreak’s origin.  The German O104 E. coli strain produces a toxin that
attacks the kidneys and blood vessels. Since May 2, 674 people
have developed the life-threatening complication in the EU, and
an additional 1,755 have been stricken with diarrhea, the
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said June 7.  As much as 80 percent of vegetables are being destroyed in
some areas because there is no market for them, Copa-Cogeca, a
farm lobby group based in Brussels, said June 7 in a report. EU
food producers are losing as much as 400 million euros a week
from the drop in demand, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
