CafePress Inc. , an e-commerce
service that lets users customize T-Shirts and tote bags, is
seeking to raise $80 million in an initial public offering amid
a surge in Internet IPOs.  The offering will be handled by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,
Jefferies Group Inc. and Cowen & Co., according to a regulatory
filing today by  San Mateo , California-based CafePress, founded
in 1999.  The company enables customers to print slogans and other
messages on products such as water bottles, posters and
stickers. CafePress is following Internet companies such as
LinkedIn Corp., the largest professional-networking site, in
raising money from public markets. Groupon Inc., the biggest
online coupon site, is also planning an IPO.  CafePress sales rose 46 percent to $32 million in the
quarter ended March 31, according to the filing. The net loss
widened to $831,000 from $40,000.  The company earned $2.7 million in 2010 as sales grew 24
percent to $127.9 million, following a revenue decline in 2009.
The drop was caused by “macro-economic conditions” that
reduced discretionary spending coupled with the absence of an
election year, according to the filing.  Investors in the company include co-founders Fred Durham
and Maheesh Jain, and  Sequoia Capital , a venture-capital firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
