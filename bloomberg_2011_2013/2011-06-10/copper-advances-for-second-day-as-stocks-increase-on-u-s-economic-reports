Copper declined and headed for a
second weekly loss after  China , the world’s largest user,
reported lower imports from last month and a year ago.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange lost as
much as 0.7 percent to 8,988 a metric ton and traded at
$9,029.75 a ton by 2:51 p.m. Singapore time, reversing an
earlier gain of as much as 0.4 percent.  China imported 254,738 tons of copper and copper products
in May, 3 percent less than the 262,676 tons in April, according
to customs. The May imports were 36 percent below the 396,712
tons in the year-ago month, according to Bloomberg data.  The numbers “are quite soft,” said Nicholas Zhu, head of
macro-commodity research for  Asia  at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group in Shanghai. “I don’t expect a big price decline
in copper as a result of lower imports. Manufacturing in China
overall is still expanding,” he said by phone.  Copper has dropped for three consecutive months, losing 6
percent this year on the LME as China’s attempts to rein in
above-target inflation reduced credit, curbing production that
typically fuels usage of raw materials. Manufacturing advanced
in May at the slowest pace in nine months, one report shows,
while a second indicated the weakest growth in 10 months.  July-delivery copper in  New York  fell 0.5 percent to
$4.0885 per pound, reversing an earlier gain. August-delivery
metal advanced for the first time in four days on the  Shanghai 
Futures Exchange, gaining as much as 1.1 percent to 68,090 yuan
($10,511) a ton and last traded at 67,490 yuan a ton.  China Stockpiles  Stockpiles at Chinese bonded warehouses dropped by half
from 600,000 tons to 700,000 tons in March as inventories in
warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 50
percent, according to Barclays Capital analyst  Gayle Berry .  Open interest on LME copper futures fell to 436,855
contracts as of June 7, according to the latest LME report, 12
percent below this year’s peak of 496,945 contracts on Jan. 13.  Aluminum lost 0.3 percent to $2,651.25 a ton. The metal is
the best performer among the six major base metals on the LME,
having risen 7 percent this year.  Nickel dropped 0.7 percent to $23,042 a ton and lead fell 1
percent at $2,584. Tin was the only gainer, advancing 0.4
percent to $25,800. Zinc was unchanged at $2,285.  -- With assistance from Helen Sun in Shanghai. Editors:
