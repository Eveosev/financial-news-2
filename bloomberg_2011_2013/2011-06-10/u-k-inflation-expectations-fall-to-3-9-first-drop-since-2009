Britons’ inflation expectations fell
last month for the first time since February 2009, easing
pressure on the  Bank of England  to increase  interest rates .  U.K. consumers questioned in May expected prices to
increase 3.9 percent over the coming year, the Bank of England
said in a quarterly survey published in London today. That’s
down from a reading of 4 percent in February.  The central bank kept its key interest rate at a record low
yesterday as a majority of policy makers chose to support the
recovery over tackling an inflation rate that hit 4.5 percent in
April, more than double the bank’s target. Those calling for
higher rates in recent months argued that expectations of faster
inflation might become entrenched in wage and price-setting.  Fifty-five percent of respondents expected the bank to
raise its benchmark interest rate over the following 12 months,
down from 62 percent in February. Pollster GfK NOP questioned
2,045 people aged 16 and over between May 12 and May 17.  Asked about inflation in about five years’ time, the median
answer was 3.3 percent compared with 3.5 percent in February.
Expectations for inflation in the 12 months from May 2012
slipped to 3.2 to 3.4 percent.  Asked to give the current rate of inflation, respondents
gave a median answer of 4.5 percent, up from 4.4 percent in
February.  Recent data suggest the recovery is losing momentum and
investors are betting on a quarter-point rate increase in April,
according to forward contracts on the sterling overnight
interbank average, or Sonia, compiled by Tullett Prebon Plc.
Less than a month ago, they were betting on November 2011.  Growth has stagnated since September and investment and
consumer spending slumped the most in almost two years in the
first quarter. Manufacturing expanded at the slowest pace in 20
months in May and services grew the least since February,
according to Markit Economics Ltd., which said the data indicate
economic growth this quarter may not exceed 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
