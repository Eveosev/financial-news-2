Venezuela  may sell private banks
certificates of deposit to help finance the governmentâ€™s housing
program,  El Universal  reported, without saying where it obtained
the information.  Private banks, which have an extra 10 billion bolivars
($2.33 billion) of cash available following a three-percentage-
point reduction in  reserve requirements  last month, would
purchase the certificates from the state-run National
Development Bank through the central bank, the Caracas-based
newspaper said.  The certificates, which would probably have a three- to
four-year maturity, may receive annual interest of 1 percent to
5 percent, El Universal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
