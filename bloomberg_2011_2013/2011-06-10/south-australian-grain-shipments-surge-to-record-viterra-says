Grain exports from  South Australia ,
the country’s second-largest wheat-producing state, doubled to a
record in the second quarter and may remain strong as there are
further supplies in storage, according to  Viterra Inc. (VT)   Shipments through South Australian ports were 2.4 million
metric tons in the three months to April 30, the Regina,
Saskatchewan-based company said in a statement yesterday. That
compares with 1.2 million tons a year earlier, it said.  Wheat has surged 73 percent in Chicago over the past year
as droughts in  China , Europe and the U.S. cut output, helping to
push global food prices to an all-time high in February.
Australia’s wheat exports may jump 11.3 percent to 16.5 million
tons in 2011, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said yesterday.  “The company expects shipments to remain strong given the
significant crop in storage, the favorable commodity-pricing
environment and strong demand,” the statement said. Viterra
owns and operates about 95 percent of South Australia’s storage
and all of its port-terminal capacity.  Wheat plantings in the state may rise 7 percent to 5.8
million acres (2.3 million hectares) and canola plantings may be
600,000 acres, the statement said. The area planted to barley
may fall 4 percent to 2.2 million acres, it said.  South Australia’s winter-crop production may be a record
9.8 million tons in the 2010-2011, the  Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences  said Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter for this story:
