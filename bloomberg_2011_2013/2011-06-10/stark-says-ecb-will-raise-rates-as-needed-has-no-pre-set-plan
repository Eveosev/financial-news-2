European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said the bank will adjust interest
rates “whenever necessary” and has no pre-set tightening plan.  “There is no pre-defined sequence as regards interest-rate
decisions and the decisions on the phasing-out of non-standard
Measures,” Stark said in a speech in  Frankfurt  today.
Currently, “we see risks to  price stability  on the upside,” he
said. “This calls for strong vigilance. In this respect, we
stand ready to further adjust our still very accommodative
monetary policy stance.”  ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet yesterday signaled the
bank is ready to raise its benchmark rate again in July after
lifting it to 1.25 percent in April. The ECB also increased its
growth and inflation forecasts for this year. It now expects the
euro-area economy to expand 1.9 percent, up from the previous
1.7 percent projection, and inflation to average 2.6 percent
rather than 2.3 percent.  “Economic recovery in the euro area is on a more self-
sustained path,” Stark said. “Looking ahead, we expect the
economy to further benefit from ongoing global growth and the
still accommodative monetary policy stance.”  For next year, the ECB forecasts growth and inflation will
both average 1.7 percent. Stark said earlier today that the
inflation forecast for 2012 assumes “higher short-term  interest
rates ,” suggesting he may favor tightening policy beyond July.  Stark also said the ECB will “act in a timely manner as
regards further steps to phase out our non-standard measures.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
