China ’s daily net crude imports fell
2 percent in May from a month earlier as higher prices cut
purchases by domestic refineries that turned to stockpiles to
process oil into fuels.  Net imports last month dropped to 21.5 million metric tons,
or 5.1 million barrels a day, compared with April, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on  data posted  today on the website
of the Beijing-based General Administration of Customs.  Oil processors including  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) 
and PetroChina Co. are facing their biggest refining losses
since October 2008 because of higher crude costs and government-
capped fuel prices, data from HSBC Plc show. China paid an
average $115 for each barrel of crude bought in May compared
with $109 in April, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
the customs data.  “Crude is still very expensive, so the loss-making
refiners would have turned to stockpiles to avoid importing,”
Gong Manying, a market research director at PetroChina, said by
telephone in Beijing. “They would also have cleared inventories
so that they can import when crude prices get lower.”  Net imports of fuel, including gasoline and diesel, fell to
930,000 tons last month from 1.2 million tons in April,
according to the customs data. Net purchases reached a 29-month
high of 2.07 million tons in December.  China exported 880,000 tons of coal in May. The government
didn’t provide data on coal imports for May today.  Coal imports in the first five months dropped 17 percent to
56.88 million tons, according to a separate report posted on the
customs department’s website.  --Chua Baizhen. Editors: Ryan Woo,  Jane Lee .  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
