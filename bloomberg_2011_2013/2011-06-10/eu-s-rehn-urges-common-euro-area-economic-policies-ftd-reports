European Union Economics and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  urged euro-area
countries to consider increasing their coordination of economic
policies, the Financial Times Deutschland said, citing remarks
by Rehn at a banking conference.  European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet’s call
last week for a joint euro-area finance ministry was a valuable
contribution, the newspaper quoted Rehn as saying at the June 8
event in Koenigstein,  Germany .  To contact the reporter on this story:
