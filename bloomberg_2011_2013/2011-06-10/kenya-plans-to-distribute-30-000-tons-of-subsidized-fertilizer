Kenya  will distribute 30,000 metric
tons of fertilizer to grain farmers at subsidized prices to help
boost production, the National Cereals and Produce Board said.  The East African nation yesterday took delivery of a
consignment of 600,000 50-kilogram (110-pound) bags of the
chemicals at Mombasa Port. The calcium ammonium nitrate will be
used mainly by wheat and corn farmers, Evans Wasike, a spokesman
for the board, said in a phone interview from Nairobi, the
capital.  The fertilizer will be sold by the board to farmers at
1,700 shillings ($19.38) per bag, compared with the 2,500
shillings it sells for in the open market, Wasike said.  “The cost is subsidized by the government to encourage use
and improve productivity,” he said. “The bulk of the CAN
fertilizer is expected to be bought by maize farmers.”  Kenya plans to boost  food production  over the next two
decades by using 1 million hectares of currently uncultivated
land and new cultivating as much as 1.2 million hectares of
newly opened land, according to the  Kenya Vision 2030  plan.  Kenya’s government earlier this year set aside 4.3 billion
shillings to buy fertilizer for small-scale farmers, Business
Daily, a Nairobi-based newspaper, reported in March, citing
Agriculture Minister Sally Kosgei. Over the past year, the
country almost tripled fertilizer imports to 22 percent of total
supplies from 8 percent previously, it said. Domestic demand is
about 500,000 metric tons a year, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
