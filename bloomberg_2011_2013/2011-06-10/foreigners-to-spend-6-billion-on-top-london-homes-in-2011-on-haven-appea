Overseas spending on  London  luxury
homes will total 3.7 billion pounds ($6 billion) this year as a
weak pound and the city’s reputation as a financial haven
attract buyers,  Savills Plc (SVS)  said.  Buyers based outside the U.K. will probably spend 16.5
billion pounds in the five years through 2011, or 26 percent of
the total, the London-based broker estimated.  “London is a funnel for international wealth and equity
coming into the U.K.,” Yolande Barnes, Savills’s head of
residential research, said at a presentation today.  The pound’s 18 percent slide against a basket of currencies
since the end of 2007 has attracted overseas buyers to
residential properties worth at least 1 million pounds in the
British capital. The perception of London real estate as a
secure asset has persuaded overseas investors to buy in the city
when faced by financial and political instability in their home
markets, Savills said.  The largest group of foreign buyers is from western  Europe ,
while the biggest individual purchases were made by investors
from Eastern Europe, Russia and the former Soviet Union
countries. The average purchase price from that group was
6.2 million pounds, Savills said.  Ukraine’s wealthiest individual,  Rinat Akhmetov , paid 136.6
million pounds for a penthouse at  One Hyde Park , the Financial
Times reported, citing title deeds documents filed in April with
the  Land Registry .  The inflow of overseas money has led British owners in the
prime central London market to sell more properties than they
buy, investing most of the proceeds in southwest London
neighborhoods such as Fulham and Wandsworth, Barnes said.
