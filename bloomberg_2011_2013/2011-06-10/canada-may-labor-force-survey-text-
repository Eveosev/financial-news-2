Following is the text of
 Canada 's labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Employment rose by 22,000 in May, bringing gains over
the previous 12 months to 273,000 (+1.6%). The employment
increase in May, combined with a decline in the number of
people looking for work, pushed the unemployment rate down
0.2 percentage points to 7.4%.  Employment increased in Quebec,  Alberta  and
Saskatchewan in May. At the same time, employment declined
in Newfoundland and Labrador, while there was little
change in the remaining provinces.  Employment gains were in retail and wholesale trade as
well as in information, culture and recreation, while
there were declines in educational services and
manufacturing.  The number of private sector employees and self-
employed workers rose in May. At the same time, there were
declines among public sector employees.  Full-time employment increased by 33,000 in May. Over
the past 12 months, full-time employment rose by 224,000
(+1.6%) while part time was up 50,000 (+1.5%).  Employment was up mainly among men aged 25 to 54, while
it changed little among the other demographic groups.  The  unemployment rate  for students aged 20 to 24, at
15.0%, was lower in May compared with May 2010.  Gains driven by retail and wholesale trade  Employment in trade increased by 34,000 in May,
offsetting declines in the previous two months. Compared
with 12 months earlier, employment in this industry was
down 0.7% or 19,000.  There were also employment gains in information,
culture and recreation (+15,000). Employment in this
industry has risen by 41,000 (+5.5%) in the past 12
months.  Following steady increases in the first four months of
the year, employment in educational services declined by
27,000 in May. Most of the declines occurred in post-
secondary institutions.  Manufacturing employment was down by 23,000, following
little change in the previous four months. Despite this
decline, employment in this industry has risen by 25,000
or 1.4% since May 2010.  Employment in construction was little changed, although
it has increased by 3.3% (+41,000) over the past 12
months.  Despite little change in public administration in May,
this industry was up 1.8% over the previous 12 months.
Employment gains from 2011 Census activities in May were
offset by slight declines in other sectors of the federal
administration.  There were employment gains of 37,000 among private
sector employees and 30,000 among self-employed workers in
May. At the same time, employment fell by 44,000 among
public sector employees.  Over the past 12 months, employment in the private
sector has grown by 178,000 (+1.6%), compared with 48,000
(+1.4%) in the public sector and 48,000 (+1.8%) among the
self-employed.  Increases in  Quebec , Alberta and Saskatchewan  Employment in Quebec rose by 25,000 in May, bringing
total gains over the past 12 months to 74,000 (+1.9%). The
unemployment rate fell 0.5 percentage points to 7.3%, the
lowest since October 2008.  Employment increased by 8,500 in Alberta. The
unemployment rate fell to 5.4%, down 0.5 percentage points
from the previous month. Over the previous 12 months,
employment grew by 2.8%, the fastest growth rate in the
country.  In Saskatchewan, employment increased by 2,500, yet was
little changed compared with May 2010 (+0.2%). The
unemployment rate, at 5.0%, was unchanged from the
previous month and was the lowest in the country.  Following an increase in April, employment declined by
2,700 in Newfoundland and Labrador in May. At the same
time, the unemployment rate rose to 11.9% (+0.8 percentage
points). This province has the second fastest employment
growth rate over the previous 12 months, up 2.1% (+4,700).  Employment edged down in Ontario in May (-16,000). Over
the past 12 months, employment growth at 1.7% (+116,000)
was slightly above the national average, and all in full-
time work. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at
7.9% in May.  Employment growth primarily among core-aged men  Employment rose by 21,000 among core-aged men (25 to 54
years) in May, while it held steady among the other
demographic groups.  Compared with 12 months earlier, employment increased
at the fastest pace among workers aged 55 and over, with
growth of 6.6% (+86,000) among women and 4.1% (+67,000)
among men. Over the same period, employment among core-
aged men increased by 2.0% (+118,000), while it was little
changed for core-aged women and youths.  Student summer employment  From May to August, the Labour Force Survey collects
labour market information about young people aged 15 to 24
who were attending school full time in March and who
intend to return to school in the fall. The May survey
results provide the first indicators of the summer job
market, especially for students aged 20 to 24, as students
aged 15 to 19 are not yet out of school for the summer.
The data for June, July and August will provide further
insight into the summer job market. The published
estimates are not seasonally adjusted, and therefore
comparisons can only be made from one year to another.  The employment rate or the proportion of students aged
20 to 24 who were employed in May was 60.8%, higher than
the May 2010 rate of 58.9%. It was also 4.5 percentage
points higher than in May 2009 (56.3%), when students were
especially affected by the labour market downturn.  The unemployment rate for the students aged 20 to 24
was 15.0% in May, down from 16.5% in May 2010.  Note to readers  Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample, and are therefore subject to sampling variability.
Estimates for smaller geographic areas or industries will
have more variability. For an explanation of sampling
variability of estimates, and how to use standard errors
to assess this variability, consult the "Data quality"
section of the publication Labour Force Information (71-
001-X, free).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents
seasonally adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by
removing the effects of seasonal variations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
