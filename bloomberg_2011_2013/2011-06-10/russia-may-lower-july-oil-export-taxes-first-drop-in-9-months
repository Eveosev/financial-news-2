Russia  may lower its export duty on
most crude shipments as much as 4.1 percent on July 1, the first
decrease since October, after  oil prices  fell.  The standard duty will probably decline to between $443.20
and $445.30 a metric ton ($60.46-$60.75 a barrel), according to
Bloomberg calculations based on Finance Ministry data. That
compares with $462.10 a ton in June, the highest level since a
record $495.90 a ton in August and September 2008.  The discounted rate on some oil pumped via Russia’s East
Siberian-Pacific Ocean pipeline to  Asia  and from the  Caspian Sea 
may fall within a range of $204.50 to $205.90 a ton from $217.50
in June.  Brent and Urals, Russia’s benchmark export blend, have
fallen in the past month on speculation fuel demand may slow
with economic growth. Russia sets its export duties based on the
average Urals price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th
day of the next. Urals will probably be $112.27 to $112.70
during this monitoring period,  Alexander Sakovich , a Finance
Ministry adviser, said by phone today.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  must sign the draft for the
rates to come into effect.  A special gasoline tax that Putin imposed starting May 1 to
fight domestic shortages may be continued at a level of $398.90
to $400.80 a ton, Sakovich said. That is 90 percent of the crude
duty.  The export tax on light oil products may be reduced to $297
to $298.30 a ton. The duty on heavy products may be set at $207
to $207.90 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
