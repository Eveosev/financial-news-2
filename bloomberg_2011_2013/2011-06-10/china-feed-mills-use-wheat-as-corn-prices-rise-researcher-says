Feed mills in China, the biggest
grain user, are using more wheat as a raw material to cope with
rising costs of corn, the China National Grain & Oils
Information Center said.  Wheat is now about 5 percent cheaper in southern  Guangdong
province , the state-backed researcher said in a report sent by
e-mail. The price advantage of wheat will gain as more supply
becomes available following the harvest, it said. The price of
new-crop wheat is 100 yuan ($15) less than old crops, it said.  The price of corn in Guangdong province rose 8.7 percent
this year to a record 2,370 yuan a ton, while the price of wheat
is little changed at 2,250 yuan a ton, according to Bloomberg
data supplied by  Shanghai  JC Intelligence Co.  Between 30 percent and 40 percent of corn in animal feed
formulas can be substituted with wheat, the center said. As of
June 7, more than 42 percent of  China â€™s wheat had been
harvested, it said.  --William Bi. Editors:  Richard Dobson , Jake Lloyd-Smith  To contact the reporter on this story:
