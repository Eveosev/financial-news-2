Mexico  qualified for the
quarterfinals of the  Gold Cup  hours after suspending five
national soccer team players for testing positive for the
banned stimulant clenbuterol.  Antonio Naelson, Christian Bermudez, Edgar Duenas,
Francisco Javier Rodriguez and goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa
tested positive during a training camp in Mexico before the
Gold Cup, tournament organizer  Concacaf said on its website 
last night, citing Mexico team press officer Juan Jose Kotchen.  Concacaf, the Confederation of North, Central America and
Caribbean Association Football, will hold a meeting today to
discuss the issue and decide whether Mexico can replace the
suspended players.  The five may have inadvertently ingested the substance,
Concacaf said. Clenbuterol is used to treat respiratory
disorders such as asthma and can increase aerobic capacity by
improving the flow of oxygen in the bloodstream. Farmers
sometimes use it illegally to bulk up cattle more quickly.  Germany ’s anti-doping agency in April  advised soccer
players  attending this month’s FIFA Under-17 World Cup in
Mexico to avoid eating meat because of the widespread use of
clenbuterol by farmers.  “As far as possible the consumption of meat products
should be omitted,” the German agency said at the time.  Mexico followed a 5-0 victory against El Salvador on June
5 with a win by the same score line over Cuba last night to
advance to the quarterfinals of the Gold Cup.  Mexico will face Cost Rica on June 12 at Soldier Field in
 Chicago  after games at  Cowboys Stadium  in Arlington, Texas, and
at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte,  North Carolina .  Cycling’s ruling body is challenging a decision not to ban
three-time Tour de France champion Alberto Contador after he
failed a test for clenbuterol at last year’s race. The Union
Cycliste Internationale is appealing to the Court of
Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne,  Switzerland , sport’s highest
tribunal.  Contador blames eating contaminated beef for the positive
test.  To contact the reporter on this story:
