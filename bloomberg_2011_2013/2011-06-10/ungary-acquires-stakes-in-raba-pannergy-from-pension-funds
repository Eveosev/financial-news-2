Hungary’s government acquired stakes
in Raba Nyrt., a maker of vehicles and auto parts, and  PannErgy (PANNERGY) 
Nyrt., a company that invests in geothermal projects, as part of
a takeover of assets from private pension funds.  The state gained an 11.7 percent stake in Raba, the company
said in a statement today on the website of the Budapest Stock
Exchange. The government took over the 5.5 percent stake in
PannErgy, according to a separate filing to the bourse late
yesterday.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s government gave the holders
of mandatory private pension funds an ultimatum last year;
either turn the holdings over to the state or lose 70 percent of
future pension claims. Faced with the possibility of losing the
government portion of their social-security contributions, most
opted not to block the transfers.  Hungary’s government may acquire 2.8 trillion forint ($15.3
billion) of assets managed by private pension funds, including
shares and  government bonds , pension lobby group Stabilitas
Penztarszovetseg said on June 2, based on preliminary data.  Raba gained 0.9 percent to 795 forint by 10:36 a.m. in
Budapest. PannErgy rose 1.2 percent to 875 forint.  To contact the reporter on this story:
