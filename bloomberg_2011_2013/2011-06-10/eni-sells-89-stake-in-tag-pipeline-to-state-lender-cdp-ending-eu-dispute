Eni SpA (ENI)  agreed to sell its 89
percent stake in the Trans-Austria Gas pipeline, known as TAG,
to Italian state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA, settling
a dispute with European regulators.  CDP will pay 483 million euros ($700 million), plus the
reimbursement of a loan for 192 million euros, according to a
statement from the two companies.  Eni,  Italy ’s largest energy company, last year averted
possible European Union antitrust fines after regulators
accepted its offer to settle a competition case by selling
stakes in natural-gas pipelines including TAG, which crosses
Austria from the Slovak border to the Italian frontier, bringing
gas from  Russia .  Under the settlement with the EU, Eni was able to avoid the
risk of fines for restricting access to its transmission
network. The Brussels-based European Commission, the EU’s
executive body, said in 2009 that Eni may have abused its
dominant position by limiting its investment in a network that
brings Russian gas into the country via Germany and  Austria .  Eni’s so-called ship-or-pay contract with TAG will remain
in effect after the deal’s conclusion, according to the
statement. Under such contracts, a buyer agrees to pay for
contracted transportation capacity regardless of actual volume.  TAG is managed by Trans Austria Gasleitung GmbH, a
partnership of Eni and Austria’s OMV AG, which owns the
remaining stake in the pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
