Google Inc. (GOOG) , the world’s largest
Internet-search company, is close to buying advertising-
technology company  Admeld Inc.  for about $400 million, according
to a person with knowledge of the discussions.  The person declined to be identified because the matter
isn’t public. Katelin Todhunter-Gerberg, a spokeswoman for
 Mountain View , California-based Google, declined to comment, as
did New York-based Admeld.  AdMeld gives Web publishers access to advertising from
hundreds of sources, such as ad networks. The New York-based
company, founded in 2007, has customers that include News
Corp.’s Fox News and the Weather Channel.  Google, which has come under regulatory scrutiny for some
of its acquisitions, has been buying companies in the
advertising market to compete better against rivals such as
Facebook Inc. and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  Google bought mobile ad service
AdMob Inc. last year for about $700 million and online
advertising provider DoubleClick Inc. in 2008 for $3.2 billion.  The AdMeld acquisition was reported earlier today by the
TechCrunch blog.  Google fell $2.44 to $516.73 at 4 p.m. New York time on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have fallen 13 percent this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
