Spie Batignolles SA, the French
construction company being bought by a group led by Clayton
Dubilier & Rice LLC, will get about 1.7 billion euros ($2.5
billion) of senior debt to fund its buyout, according to a
person with knowledge of the deal.  The financing will include a 375 million-euro high-yield
bond and about 1.3 billion euros of secured loans from banks and
funds, said the person, who declined to be identified because
the transaction is private.  HSBC Holdings Plc, Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale SA
are arranging the financing, the person said. Credit Agricole
CIB and Deutsche Bank AG joined the loan portion as arrangers,
Bloomberg data show.  PAI Partners is selling Spie, based near Paris, which it
bought for 980 million euros in 2006. Clayton Dubilier, Axa
Private Equity and Canadian pension-fund manager Caisse de Depot
et Placement du  Quebec  said May 31 they are in exclusive talks
to acquire Spie from PAI, a buyout firm in Paris.  Philip Gawith, a spokesman for Clayton Dubilier and
Stephanie Grace, a spokeswoman for Axa, didn’t immediately
respond to e-mails and phone calls seeking comment. Alexandra
Nicoli, a spokeswoman for Caisse de Depot et Placement du
Quebec, also didn’t respond to a phone call and e-mail seeking
comment.  Leveraged buyout firms borrow as much as two-third of the
purchase price to fund takeovers. The debt is taken in the
target’s name and typically graded below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
