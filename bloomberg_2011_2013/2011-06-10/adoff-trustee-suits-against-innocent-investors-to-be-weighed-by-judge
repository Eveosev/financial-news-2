A federal judge will consider
whether he needs to review lawsuits brought by the trustee
liquidating Bernard L. Madoff’s firm to recover funds from
investors who didn’t know of Madoff’s fraud when they took their
money out.  Helen Chaitman, a lawyer for some Madoff investors, on June
2 asked U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in  Manhattan  to review
108 so-called clawback actions against 313 parties. The suits
violate investor protection and securities laws, she said.
Rakoff accepted the case June 8, a court filing showed.  Trustee Irving Picard has sued about 5,000 investors whom
he conceded were innocent, according to Chaitman. He did so on
the “theory” that because they took more money out of Madoff’s
firm than they put in, they have a legal obligation to return
the difference, Chaitman said.  Picard “caused untold devastation to thousands of innocent
investors whose lives were decimated by Madoff’s fraud,”
Chaitman said in her June 2 filing. At the same time, “he is
holding sufficient money in the fund of customer property to pay
all allowed customer claims,” she said.  Amanda Remus, a Picard spokeswoman, declined to comment.  The case is Picard v. Greiff, 11-cv-3775, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
