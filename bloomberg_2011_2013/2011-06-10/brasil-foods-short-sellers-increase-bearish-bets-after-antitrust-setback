(Corrects third paragraph of story originally published
June 10 to show that two commissioners raised objections to the
 Brasil Foods  merger.)  Bearish bets against  BRF - Brasil
Foods SA (BRFS3) , the world’s largest poultry exporter, rose the most in
a month on the Bovespa stock exchange after two of Brazil’s
antitrust commissioners said the acquisition of Sadia SA should
be blocked.  The value of Brasil Foods shares on loan in Sao Paulo
increased to 318.99 million reais ($200 million) yesterday, the
highest since April 28, when Russia announced a ban on meat
imports from Brazil, according to the latest data from
BM&FBovespa SA’s clearing and depositary house  website .  Brasil Foods shares rose 0.8 percent to 25.50 reais at
11:42 a.m. New York time. The stock fell to the lowest in more
than six months yesterday after Carlos Ragazzo, one of five
commissioners with Cade, as  Brazil ’s antitrust agency is known,
said the $3.8 billion acquisition of Sadia should be blocked as
it doesn’t benefit consumers. Ragazzo said June 8 that Brasil
Foods has too much market share. A second commissioner also
voiced objections to the deal before the session was postponed
for June 15.  The amount of shares on loan show that traders have
increased bets that the stock will fall. In a short sale, a
trader borrows shares and sells them. If the price drops, the
trader profits by buying back the stock at a lower price,
repaying the loan and pocketing the difference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
