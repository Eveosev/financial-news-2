Gold may advance, set for the fourth
weekly gain, as concern about  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis and
slowing economic growth spur demand for the precious metal as an
alternative investment. Platinum rose to a one-month high.  Immediate-delivery bullion was little changed at $1,542.45
an ounce at 4:15 p.m. Seoul time, climbing 0.1 percent for the
week. Futures for August delivery were also little changed at
$1,544.40 an ounce on the Comex in  New York .  “It looks like there’s really no way out,” Bruce Ikemizu,
head of commodity trading at Standard Bank Plc, said by phone
from  Tokyo , referring to the European debt crisis. “That’s
still bullish for gold.”  The  European Central Bank  signaled a July interest rate
increase even as higher borrowing costs may exacerbate the
crisis that’s threatening to push  Greece  toward a default. The
U.S. Federal Reserve this week said the economy expanded at a
“steady pace” in most of the country while slowing in four of
12 regions, underscoring Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s statement
that record stimulus should be maintained to bolster a
“frustratingly slow” recovery.  Still, the price of gold is likely to trade between $1,530
an ounce and $1,550 an ounce next week as physical buyers wait
for prices to drop below $1,530, Ikemizu said.  Bullion has advanced 27 percent in the past year, reaching
a record $1,577.57 an ounce on May 2. The U.S. central bank has
kept its benchmark interest rate at zero percent to 0.25 percent
since December 2008.  Silver for immediate delivery declined 0.3 percent to
$37.44 an ounce. The price is up about 3.3 percent this week,
rebounding from a 4.6 percent loss last week.  Cash platinum rose as much as 0.5 percent to $1,849.25 an
ounce, the highest level since May 4, and last traded at
$1,839.50 an ounce. Palladium for immediate delivery traded
little changed at $817 an ounce, holding onto this week’s gains
of 4.2 percent. The metal yesterday rose to $819.38, the highest
price since March 7. Both metals are set to climb for the fourth
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
