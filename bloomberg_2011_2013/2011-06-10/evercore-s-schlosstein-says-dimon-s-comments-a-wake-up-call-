Ralph Schlosstein, chief executive
officer of  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , said  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  CEO
Jamie Dimon’s questioning of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke on bank regulatory costs was “a wake-up call.”  “When we have these cataclysmic events, we tend to over-
correct in the other direction,” Schlosstein said today in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop” with Betty Liu. “He is carefully pointing out that we want to make sure
that we do not stunt economic activity or harm the financial
businesses.”  Dimon, head of the most profitable  U.S. bank , pressed
Bernanke in a public forum on June 7 on whether regulators have
gone too far in pulling back the banking system and have stunted
economic growth. Regulators are drafting rules as part of the
Dodd-Frank Act overhaul of financial-industry oversight, seeking
to prevent a recurrence of the 2008 credit freeze that prompted
a taxpayer bailout of the banking system.  Higher capital standards and lower levels of trading
activities are driving down share prices of some of the biggest
banks, Schlosstein said. New York-based Evercore, whose shares
are up 4.3 percent this year through yesterday, is largely
unaffected by these trends, he said.  “There is justification for added capital for these larger
institutions,” Schlosstein said. Bigger banks are
systematically more important to the financial system, and risky
activities require a capital cushion, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
