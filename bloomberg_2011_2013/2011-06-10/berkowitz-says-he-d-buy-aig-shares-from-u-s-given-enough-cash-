Bruce Berkowitz , chief investment
officer at Fairholme Capital Management LLC, said he would help
buy the  U.S. Treasury ’s stake in  American International Group
Inc. (AIG)  if he had the money.  The gradual divestment by Treasury of its 77 percent
holding in AIG is “the No. 1 worry” among investors
considering a purchase of the New York-based insurer’s stock,
Berkowitz said yesterday in an interview from the  Morningstar
Inc.  investor conference in Chicago. The interview is scheduled
to air today on Bloomberg Television.  “People want to stay away until the United States Treasury
is out, which has pushed the price down dramatically,” said
Berkowitz, who controlled 2.3 percent of AIG through Fairholme
as of March 31. “If I had enough cash, it wouldn’t take long at
all” for Treasury to reduce its stake below 50 percent, he
said.  AIG is the second-worst-performing stock in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index this year. The insurer, once the world’s
biggest, is down 42 percent from Dec. 31 through yesterday,
compared with the 2.5 percent advance in the  S&P 500 . AIG posted
its first annual profit in three years in 2010. Berkowitz said
he increased his AIG stake in May by buying stock in a Treasury
offering.  “I think a bunch of people should get together who really
do recognize the value of AIG, and just take the U.S. Treasury
out tomorrow,” Berkowitz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
