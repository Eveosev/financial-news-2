Cotton gained for a third straight
day on concern supply may trail demand as drought reduces crops
in the U.S., the world’s largest shipper. Orange juice rose.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  cut its outlook for
domestic cotton production yesterday. It was the first time the
government lowered its June forecast from May since 1998. Crops
in Texas, the biggest producing state, are suffering after the
driest May since 1956, according to an agricultural program at
Texas A&M University in  College Station . Prices are up 69
percent in the past year.  “I think more and more the focus is going to be on how
much of the U.S. crop is going to be available,” said Louis Barbera, a broker with VIP Commodities in  New York . “The big
thing about cotton is the consumption. That’s going to be the
thing that drives it.”  Cotton for December delivery gained 0.66 cent, or 0.5
percent, to $1.3365 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. The price fell
3.6 percent this week.  Orange-juice  futures for July delivery increased 1.2 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $1.849 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
