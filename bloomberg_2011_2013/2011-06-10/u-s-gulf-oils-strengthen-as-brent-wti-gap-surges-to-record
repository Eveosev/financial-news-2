U.S. Gulf crude grades strengthened
as the spread between the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
and Brent surged to the largest ever.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for June
delivery increased $1.56 to $19.20 a barrel as of 1:16 p.m. in
 New York . When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 85 cents to $17.60
over WTI as of 1:08 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet added 95 cents to $17.20 a
barrel over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend widened $1.30 to $13.75 a barrel. Poseidon gained $1.75 to
$13 over WTI.  Thunder Horse’s premium widened $1.05 to $16.80 a barrel.
Southern Green Canyon increased 25 cents to $10.50 a barrel over
WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount widened 10 cents to $1.90 a
barrel.  The premium for Syncrude gained 10 cents to $9.85 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed $1 to $18 a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
