Auburn University  extended football
coach Gene Chizik’s contract through 2015 and increased his
salary to $3.5 million after he led the Tigers to their first
national championship since 1957, the school said in a
 statement .  Chizik’s salary is a $1.4 million raise from last season at
the Auburn, Alabama-based school and would have put him eighth
among college coaches in 2010, according to USA Today’s  salary
database .  It also leaves him as the second-highest-paid college
football coach in the state. University of  Alabama  coach Nick Saban’s $5.2 million salary made him the highest-paid coach in
college football last season, followed by Texas’s Mack Brown
($5.1 million) and Oklahoma’s Bob Stoops ($4.3 million),
according to  USA Today .  Chizik, 49, guided the Tigers to a 22-5 record in two
seasons and made $2.1 million in base salary last season. He
earned another $1.3 million in bonuses after Auburn beat the
University of Oregon 22-19 in the Bowl Championship Series title
game, the  Associated Press  reported.  If he reaches his incentives, Chizik could earn as much as
$4.5 million a year, according to the statement from the school.  “We believe that we have the best coach in college
football,” Auburn Athletic Director Jay Jacobs said in a
statement.  Chizik joined Auburn in December 2008 after coaching at
Iowa State.  Auburn opens the season at home Sept. 3 against Utah State.  To contact the reporter on this story:
