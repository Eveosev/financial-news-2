Hungary plans to oblige fast-food
restaurants to cut the calorie and salt content of their food
and drink offerings and may make them pay for public health
programs, state-run news service  MTI  reported today.  The government plans to target  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the
world’s largest restaurant chain and Burger King Holdings Inc.,
the second-largest hamburger restaurant chain, with regulations
also focusing on sugar and fat content, MTI said, citing Janos Lazar, leader of the ruling Fidesz party’s parliamentary group.  The government wants to ban discounts and presents to
children on meals which don’t meet health standards, Lazar said,
according to MTI. Hodmezovasarhely, a town where Lazar is mayor,
will only allow the opening of a new McDonald’s restaurant if
the company pays at least 8 million forint ($44,000) into a
public health program informing children about the health risks
of eating fast food, MTI added.  MCD US <Equity>
