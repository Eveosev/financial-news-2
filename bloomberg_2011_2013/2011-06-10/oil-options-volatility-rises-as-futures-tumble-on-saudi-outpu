Oil options volatility rose as the
underlying futures plunged the most in four weeks after the al-
Hayat newspaper reported  Saudi Arabia  will boost oil production
to 10 million barrels a day next month.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 29.9 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New

July $95 puts, with 2,421 lots changing hands. They rose 19
cents to 37 cents a barrel. August $90 puts, the next-most
active option, gained 34 cents to 94 cents a barrel with 2,112
lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
