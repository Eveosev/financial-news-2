OPEC crude production rose in May as
 Saudi Arabia , the group’s biggest exporter, pumped the most
since 2008, according to the group’s Vienna-based secretariat.  Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,  Qatar  and the  United Arab Emirates 
proposed a 1.5 million barrel-a-day increase in output targets
at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries June 8
meeting in Vienna. The group failed to reach an accord after the
plan was opposed by  Libya , Angola, Ecuador, Algeria, Iran and
Venezuela, Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi said.  Daily production from the 11 OPEC members that are bound by
quotas was 26.32 million barrels a day last month, the group
said today in its monthly oil market report. That’s up from
26.17 million in April, OPEC said. The group OPEC cites
secondary sources for its data.  Output from Saudi Arabia rose to 8.86 million last month,
compared with 8.8 million in April. The group’s total supply,
including Iraq, was at 28.97 million barrels a day in May versus
28.8 million the previous month, OPEC said.  “The increase came mainly from Saudi Arabia,  Nigeria ,
 Angola , Venezuela and Iraq while crude production from Libya
experienced a decline,” OPEC said.  OPEC’s compliance with record production cuts fell to 65
percent last month compared with 68 percent in April, according
to Bloomberg calculations. Compliance percentages are based on
combined output from the 11 members that committed to reduce
from a base rate in September 2008 of 29.045 million barrels.  Libyan supplies fell to 169,000 barrels a day last month as
clashes between forces loyal to Muammar Qaddafi and anti-
government rebels halted output. That compares with an average
1.56 million last year, according to the report.  The producer group, provider of about 40 percent of the
world’s crude, announced its biggest-ever supply cuts in late
2008 amid a collapse in global demand. The decision capped
production at 24.845 million barrels a day for all members
except Iraq, which is exempt from the quota system.  OPEC’s members are  Algeria , Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
