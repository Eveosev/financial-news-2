Hempel AS, a Danish supplier of
coatings, agreed to buy Crown Paints to expand in the U.K.
market for household paint that’s dominated by  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA) ’s
Dulux brand.  Endless LLP, which bought the unprofitable brand in 2008,
sold the business after returning it around, the companies said
in an e-mailed statement today. Hempel paid more than 100
million pounds ($162 million) for Crown Paints, said a person
with knowledge of the transaction, who declined to be identified
because terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.  The 230 year-old paint business, once part of Imperial
Chemical Industries, attracted interest from several potential
bidders, Crown Paints Chief Executive Officer Brian Davidson
said in an interview last month. Akzo sold the business
following European antitrust rulings over its $15.9 billion ICI
purchase.  “The business has outperformed just about every key
metric, which is an outstanding achievement given recent
economic turmoil,” Endless partner Warwick Ley said in a
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story: Andrew Noel in  London  at
