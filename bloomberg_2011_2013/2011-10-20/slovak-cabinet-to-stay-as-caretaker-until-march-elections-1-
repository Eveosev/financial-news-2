Slovak Prime Minister  Iveta Radicova ’s Cabinet, which lost a no-confidence vote on Oct. 11,
will stay on in a caretaker role until early elections scheduled
for March, President Ivan Gasparovic said.  Radicova’s four-party coalition agreed with the opposition
on changing the constitution to allow the president to keep the
premier in place, Gasparovic told journalists today in the
capital, Bratislava.  Radicova lost the confidence of lawmakers in a motion that
was tied to a vote on enhancing the euro region’s bailout fund.
The main opposition party Smer then agreed to back the European
Financial Stability Facility in a second vote held on Oct 13 in
exchange for holding elections on March 10.  The agreement allows the premier, who has been in power
since July 2010, to attend a meeting of EU leaders on Oct. 23,
where they will discuss how to prevent contagion from the
region’s debt crisis that began almost two years ago in  Greece .  The governing parties led by Radicova’s SDKU group, also
agreed on supporting in parliament the 2012 budget, which seeks
to cut the  budget deficit  to 3.8 percent of gross domestic
product from an estimated 4.9 percent this year, said Richard
Sulik, the chairman of the coalition’s Freedom and Solidarity
party that refused to back changes to the bailout fund, toppling
the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
