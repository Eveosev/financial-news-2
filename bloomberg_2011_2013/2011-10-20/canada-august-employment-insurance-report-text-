The following is the text of
 Canada 's employment insurance report for Aug. released
by Statistics Canada.  The number of people receiving regular Employment
Insurance (EI) benefits increased by 35,200 (+6.6%) to
568,600 in August, following a decline of similar
magnitude in July.  The number of beneficiaries rose in every province,
with the largest percentage increases occurring in
Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan.  More Employment Insurance beneficiaries in August  Claims up in August  To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a
claim. The number of claims provides an indication of the
number of people who could become beneficiaries.  The number of initial and renewal claims rose for the
second consecutive month, up 10,700 (+4.4%) to 255,600 in
August. The largest percentage increase occurred in  Quebec 
(+23.6%) as well as Newfoundland and Labrador (+19.8%).
This contrasts with Ontario and Alberta, where the number
of claims fell by 6.5% and 4.2%, respectively.  Number of claims up for the second consecutive month  More beneficiaries in all provinces  The number of regular beneficiaries was up in all
provinces, with the largest percentage increase in
Manitoba (+14.1%). There were also marked increases in the
number of beneficiaries in Ontario (+8.2%) and Quebec
(+6.4%).  The increases in Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec,
Saskatchewan and Alberta follow a period of continuous
decline that began nearly a year ago.  Sub-provincial and demographic overview  Employment Insurance data by sub-provincial region, sex
and age are not seasonally adjusted and are therefore
compared on a year-over-year basis.  Most large centres show year-over-year declines  Between August 2010 and August 2011, the number of
people receiving regular benefits nationally fell by
109,700 (-16.0%). Declines occurred in 131 of the 143
large centres (see map). Large centres are those with a
population of 10,000 or more.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, there were fewer
beneficiaries in all five large centres. In  St. John's ,
the number fell by 16.2%, extending the trend of monthly
year-over-year decreases that began in April 2010. In
Grand Falls-Windsor, the number declined 14.4%.  In Nova Scotia, four of the five large centres had
fewer beneficiaries in August 2011 compared with August
2010. The most notable percentage decrease was in Halifax,
where the number fell 9.4% to 5,800, extending the
downward trend that began in March 2010.  In  New Brunswick , three of the six large centres had
fewer beneficiaries in the 12 months to August, with the
fastest pace of decline in Saint John (-13.3%) and Moncton
(-12.8%).  The number of beneficiaries fell in 30 of the 33 large
centres in Quebec. The largest percentage decrease
occurred in the census metropolitan area of Quebec 
(-23.3%). There were similar year-over-year percentage
declines in Rouyn-Noranda and Saint-Hyacinthe. In
 Montreal , there were 19.7% fewer beneficiaries in August
2011 compared with August 2010, continuing the downward
trend that began in March 2010.  In Ontario, 38 of the 41 large centres had fewer
beneficiaries compared with 12 months earlier, with the
largest percentage decrease occurring in Tillsonburg.
Other large centres with marked percentage declines in
August include Guelph, Chatham-Kent and Thunder Bay. In
Toronto, the number fell by 20.0% to 74,100, extending the
trend of year-over-year declines that began in March 2010.  In Manitoba, the number of people receiving regular
benefits fell in three of the four large centres in the 12
months to August. In Winnipeg, the number of beneficiaries
declined by 18.6% to 8,800, the 12th consecutive decrease.  In Saskatchewan, all eight large centres recorded year-
over-year declines, with the fastest decrease occurring in
Moose Jaw. In Regina, 1,400 people received benefits, down
24.9% from August 2010, extending the trend of monthly
year-over-year decreases which started just over a year
ago. In Saskatoon, the number of beneficiaries fell 20.2%
to 2,600, the ninth consecutive decline.  In  Alberta , all 12 large centres had fewer
beneficiaries compared with August 2010. In Calgary, the
number fell 32.7% to 10,600, while it fell 29.5% to 11,200
in Edmonton. Other large centres with year-over-year
declines include  Grande Prairie , Red Deer, Medicine Hat
and Cold Lake.  The number of beneficiaries fell in all 25 large
centres of British Columbia, with the largest percentage
declines occurring in Campbell River, Kamloops, and Powell
River. The number of people receiving benefits also fell
in  Vancouver  (-27.5% to 26,400) and in Victoria (-18.4% to
3,300).  Demographic groups  In August, the number of men receiving regular benefits
fell by 20.7% from 12 months earlier to 268,700. There
were declines of 23.2% among men aged under 25 and 22.6%
among those aged 25 to 54. The number of male
beneficiaries aged 55 and over decreased 13.5%.  The number of women receiving benefits in August
totalled 307,600, down 11.4% from August 2010. The number
of beneficiaries decreased 20.1% among women under 25, and
fell by 12.4% among those aged 25 to 54. The pace of
decline for women 55 and over was slower, at 4.6%.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  Each month,  Statistics Canada  provides analysis of the
current labour market situation, using Employment
Insurance (EI) statistics and other sources. Earlier this
month, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) provided a picture of
overall labour market conditions, including unemployment,
total employment and characteristics of those affected by
changes in the labour market.  In this release, Statistics Canada provides additional
sub-provincial detail through the EI statistics. Details
by industry will follow with data from the Survey of
Employment, Payrolls and Hours.  EI statistics are produced from administrative data
sources provided by Service Canada and Human Resources and
Skills Development Canada. These statistics may, from time
to time, be affected by changes to the Employment
Insurance Act or administrative procedures. The number of
regular beneficiaries and the number of claims received
for July and August are preliminary. In this release,
large centres correspond to those with a population of
10,000 or more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all persons
who received EI benefits from August 14 to 20. This period
coincides with the reference week of the LFS.  EI statistics indicate the number of people who
received EI benefits, and should not be confused with data
coming from the LFS, which provides information on the
total number of unemployed people.  There is always a certain proportion of unemployed
people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed
people have not contributed to the program because they
have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment
is not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed
to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria,
such as workers who left their job voluntarily or those
who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive
benefits.  The change in the number of regular EI beneficiaries
reflects various situations, including people becoming
beneficiaries, people going back to work, and people
exhausting their regular benefits.
