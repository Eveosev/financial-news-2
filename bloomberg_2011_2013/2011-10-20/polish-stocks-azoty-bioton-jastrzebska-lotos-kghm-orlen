Poland ’s WIG20 Index declined 73.13,
or 3.2 percent, to 2,222.09 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw,
the steepest drop in almost a month.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Azoty Tarnow (ATT PW) fell for a second day, retreating 3.3
percent to 30.2 zloty as the state-controlled chemical producer
was cut to “hold” from “buy” at ING Groep NV.  Bioton SA (BIO)   sank 11 percent to 0.08 zloty as owners
of Poland’s largest biotechnology company approved a capital
increase of as much as 319.1 million zloty ($101 million)
through the issue of as many as 1.6 billion warrants for Bioton
shares to Troqueera Enterprises Ltd.  Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA (JSW PW), the producer of
coking coal for the  steel industry , sank for a fourth day,
sliding 4.4 percent to 87.4 zloty. ArcelorMittal, the world’s
largest steelmaker, may temporarily shut one of two blast
furnaces at its plant in southern Poland,  Gazeta Wyborcza 
reported, citing Sylwia Winiarek, the Polish unit’s spokeswoman.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, tumbled 6.9 percent to 134 zloty,
the steepest drop in four weeks. Copper fell on concern demand
may wane as  Europe ’s debt crisis lingers and companies question
the strength of the U.S. economic rebound.  Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA (PGN)  ,
Poland’s biggest gas distributor, fell 3.6 percent to 3.72
zloty, the lowest close in more than two months, as Societe
Generale SA cut its share-price estimate to 3.5 zloty from 4.05
zloty.  Zaklady Azotowe Pulawy SA (ZAP)   had its biggest drop in
more than two weeks, sliding 3.2 percent to 86 zloty, as ING cut
its price estimate for the fertilizer producer to 77.8 zloty
from 95.1 zloty and maintained its “sell” recommendation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
