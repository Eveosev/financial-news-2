Chile ’s peso weakened for a fourth
day as copper’s slide to a two-week low signaled a diminished
 trade surplus  for the world’s biggest producer of the metal.  The peso depreciated 0.5 percent to 514.14 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:51 a.m. Santiago time, from 511.51 yesterday. The currency
has weakened 2.8 percent since Oct. 14. The Bloomberg JPMorgan
Latin American Currency Index dropped 0.4 percent today.  Copper for December delivery fell as much as 4.1 percent to
$3.125 a pound on the Comex in  New York , sliding for a fourth
day after data showed Chinese growth slowed in the third
quarter. The euro fluctuated between gains and losses after
European Commission President  Jose Barroso  expressed optimism
the region’s leaders would reach an agreement on changes to
their debt bailout fund.  “There’s no trend here: each day has its own logic,” said
Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile in Santiago. “Taking a
position overnight is criminal. Today the drivers are the euro
and copper in New York.”  Copper accounts for more than half of Chile’s exports.  Foreign investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
trimmed long positions in the U.S. dollar for a third day to
$5.2 billion on Oct. 18, the lowest since Sept. 29, according to
central bank data.  The one-year interest-rate swap rate fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.51 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
