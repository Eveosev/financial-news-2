Greece ’s debt ratio, which exceeded
140 percent of GDP at the end of 2010, will remain “at very
high levels for many years,” leaving it “vulnerable to adverse
shocks,” according to a draft report by the European
Commission, the European Central Bank and the  International
Monetary Fund , a group known as the troika.  “Greek debt dynamics remain extremely worrying,” the
troika said. “If fiscal consolidation and privatization targets
are respected, and growth responds to structural reforms, the
debt ratio may start declining from 2013 onwards.”  “When compared with the outlook of a few months ago, the
debt sustainability has effectively deteriorated, given delays
in the recovery, in fiscal consolidation and in the
privatization plan, as well as the perspective of bank
recapitalizations.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
