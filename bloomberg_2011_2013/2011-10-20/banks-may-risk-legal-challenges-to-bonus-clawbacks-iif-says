Banks may risk legal challenges when
they attempt to apply rules to claw back bonus payments from
staff following poor performance, according to a survey by an
association representing global lenders.  The finding is part of a survey of banks’ practices
conducted by the  Institute of International Finance  in
collaboration with consulting firm  Oliver Wyman . The study
found that lenders have made “significant progress” in
implementing global standards.  Possible “legal and practical challenges” may apply to
both clawbacks of money already paid out and performance-linked
reductions in bonuses that have yet to be handed over, the study
said. “Performance-linked deferrals” in pay awards “are
cumbersome to introduce,” it said.  The introduction of rules requiring lenders to lower pay
awards if a firm or individual’s performance is weaker than
anticipated was one of several pay principles agreed on by
global regulators in April 2009.  The Financial Stability Board said this month that the U.S,
 Australia ,  Canada ,  Hong Kong  and  Japan  allow banks “more
flexibility” than European Union countries when implementing
the rules. National regulators should address the “level-
playing-field” issues, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
