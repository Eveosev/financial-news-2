Indian stocks dropped for the third
day this week amid concern persistent inflation may force the
central bank to continue next week with its record series of
rate increases, threatening the outlook for corporate earnings.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the nation’s biggest
mortgage lender, plunged the most in a month. DLF Ltd., the
largest developer, declined the most in two weeks.  Bajaj Auto
Ltd. (BJAUT) , the second-largest motorcycle maker, slid 1.4 percent
after second quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates.  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell 141.45, or
0.9 percent, to 16,936.89 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The
S&P CNX Nifty Index on National Stock Exchange of India slid 0.9
percent to 5,091.90. The BSE-200 Index lost 0.9 percent.  India’s inflation may be “under pressure” until December
and the central bank needn’t follow the policy of cutting rates
being pursued by some other nations, Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said yesterday. Food inflation reached the highest
level in almost six months, the trade ministry said today.  “High inflation, interest rates and global economic
uncertainties are not giving investors the confidence to put
their money on the table,” said  Arun Kejriwal , a director at
Kejriwal Research & Investment Services Pvt. in Mumbai. “The
central bank has no option but to increase rates.” He expects
the  Reserve Bank  of India to boost borrowing costs by 25 basis
points at its policy meeting on Oct. 25.  The RBI last month raised its repurchase rate for a 12th
time since the start of 2010 to tame inflation that has stayed
above 9 percent since the start of December.  Earnings Erosion  Record increases in borrowing costs have eroded company
earnings and prompted overseas investors to pull out a net $2.4
billion in August, the most since October 2008. The withdrawals
have caused the Sensex to drop 18 percent this year. Companies
in the gauge are valued at 14.3 times future profits, down from
21.5 times in March last year. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index
trades at 9.7 times.  Earnings reported by two out of seven Sensex companies for
the September quarter have trailed estimates, compared with 47
percent in the three months ended June, and 33 percent in the
previous quarter, Bloomberg data show.  “India’s policy mix is worsening with a much tighter-than-
expected monetary policy and looser-than expected fiscal
policy,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists led by  Tushar Poddar  wrote in a report today. “Hawkish commentary from the
RBI highlighting headline inflation as still too high for
comfort, elevated inflationary expectations, and no change in
the policy stance suggests to us that the RBI may not be ready
for a pause in its aggressive rate tightening cycle.”  The central bank may raise rates by 25 basis points, the
analysts wrote.  ‘Policy Role’  A top economic adviser to Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh 
signaled the need for higher  interest rates  before next week’s
monetary policy decision.  “The fact that inflation is triggered by food inflation or
supply side constraints doesn’t mean that the monetary policy
doesn’t have a role to play,” Chakravarthy Rangarajan, chairman
of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, said today.  Inflation is a political issue in the South Asian nation as
it erodes spending power in a nation where the  World Bank 
estimates more than three-quarters of the people live on less
than $2 a day.  “Given the inflation and that it impacts the poor quite
dramatically, another 25-basis point increase makes sense,”
Naval Bir Kumar, Chief Executive Officer of Mumbai-based IDFC
Asset Management Co. that manages $5.9 billion, said in an
interview with Bloomberg UTV. “Growth has not slowed down
much” despite the increases in borrowing costs, he said.  IMF Forecast  The  International Monetary Fund  last month reduced its
forecast for India’s economic growth. The South Asian economy
will expand 7.8 percent in 2011, the Washington-based lender
said, slower than the 8.2 percent projected in June. For 2012,
it lowered its estimate to 7.5 percent from 7.8 percent.  Housing Development Finance tumbled 4.3 percent to 644.95
rupees, its steepest plunge since Sept. 22.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the
second-biggest lender, declined 2.9 percent to 878.05 rupees.
 HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the third-biggest, lost 0.5 percent to 489.55
rupees, halting a nine-day 12 percent rally.  Bajaj Auto shed 1.4 percent to 1,613.55 rupees Ltd. Net
income rose 6 percent to 7.26 billion rupees ($146 million) in
the three months ended Sept. 30 from 6.82 billion rupees a year
earlier. That compares with the 7.65 billion-rupee median of 38
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Raw-material costs
increased 22 percent, the company said.  Battery maker Exide Industries Ltd. sank 7.7 percent to
121.3 rupees, after its net income for the quarter ended Sept.
30 missed estimates for the second straight quarter.  DLF dropped 3.6 percent to 230.6 rupees.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) ,
the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, shed 2.1 percent to 183.1
rupees, extending this year’s decline to 30 percent.  Overseas funds sold a net 2.49 billion rupees of local
equities on Oct. 18, paring their total investment this year to
9.84 billion rupees, according to the  website  of the regulator.
They withdrew a net $2.4 billion in August, the most since
October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
