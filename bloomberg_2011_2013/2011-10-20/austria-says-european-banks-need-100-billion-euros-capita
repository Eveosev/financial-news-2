Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said the European Banking Authority is estimating
European banks will need about 100 billion euros ($137 billion)
in additional capital, less than some media had reported.  “We let the European financial supervisor estimate the
capital needs for the banks to be on a sound footing,” Fekter
told retail investors at a convention in Vienna. The result
“isn’t as high as some media have reported, it’s about roughly
100 billion euros that would be needed,” she said.  European leaders are meeting on Oct. 23 to agree on a plan
to boost the region’s bailout fund and decide how to strengthen
bank capital. European recapitalization plans may amount to 70
billion euros to 90 billion euros, short of market expectations,
the Financial Times reported earlier today, citing people
familiar with the talks.  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  may be
among banks that can avoid recapitalization altogether, while
lenders may be allowed to offset gains on sovereign debt against
losses and thereby reduce the amount of additional capital
required, MF Global Ltd. said today.  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,  Italy ’s biggest bank, may have to raise 8.8
billion euros and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  may need 2.7 billion euros,
according to a note by  Simon Maughan , head of sales and
distribution at MF Global in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
