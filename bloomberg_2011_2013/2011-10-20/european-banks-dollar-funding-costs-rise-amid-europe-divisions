The cost for European banks to fund
in dollars rose as European leaders prepare for a summit to
resolve the region’s debt crisis.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro payments into dollars, was 92 basis points
below the euro interbank offered rate as of 4:15 a.m. in London,
from 90.5 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Draft documents detailing plans to enhance Europe’s bailout
fund prompted criticism from some German lawmakers who have
opposed bailout aid. The guidelines for a revamped euro-area
bailout fund showed it may provide credit lines for indebted
countries. Finance ministers gather in Brussels tomorrow to set
a common strategy, with leaders scheduled to meet Oct. 23.  The one-year basis swap was 67 basis points under Euribor
from 66 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  was little changed. The Euribor-OIS spread, the
difference between the borrowing benchmark and overnight index
swaps, held at 75 basis points. The rate reached 89 basis points
on Sept. 23, the widest since March 2009.  Overnight Deposits  Overnight deposits at the  European Central Bank  rose. Banks
parked 182 billion euros ($249 billion) at the Frankfurt-based
ECB yesterday, up from 172 billion euros on Oct. 18. That
compares with a year-to-date average of 61 billion euros.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- rose to 1.584 percent from 1.582
percent yesterday. One-week Euribor fell to 1.158 percent from
1.161 percent.  The three-month dollar  London  interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for the 30th day to 0.416 percent from 0.412
percent, according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s
the highest since Aug. 5, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, rose to 40
basis points from 39 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
