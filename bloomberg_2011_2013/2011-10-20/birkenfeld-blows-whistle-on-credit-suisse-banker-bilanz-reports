Bradley Birkenfeld, a former  UBS AG (UBSN) 
banker who has pleaded guilty to helping wealthy Americans evade
taxes, said he also shared information on a banker at  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Bilanz reported, citing information Birkenfeld
posted on the magazine’s Facebook page.  “I also blew the whistle on Credit Suisse way back in
2007,” the Zurich-based magazine cited Birkenfeld, who in the
same year informed U.S. investigators about UBS’s business
practices. “Go ask Marco Adami,” he told Bilanz via the social
networking website, the magazine said in a preview of an article
to be published on Friday.  Adami is one of the Credit Suisse bankers indicted by the
U.S. earlier this year, Bilanz said. Adami worked in Credit
Suisse’s Geneva office “until recently,” the magazine said.
Birkenfeld worked for Credit Suisse in the same town before
starting at UBS, Bilanz said. Credit Suisse spokesman  Marc Dosch 
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
