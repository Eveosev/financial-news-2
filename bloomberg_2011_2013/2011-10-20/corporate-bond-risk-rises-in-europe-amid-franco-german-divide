The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt rose as a split emerged between
 France  and Germany over how to end the region’s debt crisis.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-
default swaps on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit
ratings increased 22.5 basis points to 756.5 basis points,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 4 p.m. in  London . An
increase signals worsening perceptions of  credit quality .  France and Germany are divided over the role of the
 European Central Bank  in bolstering the 440 billion-euro ($604
billion) European Financial Stability Facility. Die Welt
reported that the German government hasn’t ruled out postponing
the debt-crisis summit scheduled for Oct. 23 in Brussels due to
stalling negotiations.  France wants “the ECB to use its balance sheet to boost
EFSF funds and for the EFSF to have a banking license.  Germany 
seems to favor the EFSF providing first loss guarantees to boost
the funds,”  Gary Jenkins , head of fixed income at Evolution
Securities in London, said in a note to clients. “Time is
running out though and the market will expect some agreement
over the weekend.”  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was up 7 at 182.75 basis points. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks
and insurers added 8.5 basis points to 250.5 and the
subordinated gauge was seven higher at 485.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments increased six basis points to 331 basis points.  Credit-default swaps protecting French debt rose 5.5 basis
points to 189.5, contracts on Germany rose three basis points to
90, Italy widened five basis points to 447, and Portugal was 33
basis points higher at 1099, according to CMA.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
