Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  has promised to
examine its agricultural commodity trading business to ensure
 Germany ’s largest bank doesn’t exacerbate hunger or poverty,
according to Foodwatch, which studies food-related issues.  The Berlin-based organization said in an Oct. 18  statement 
on its website that investment banks such as Deutsche Bank,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other financial companies are
partly responsible for famine in some of the poorest countries
as agricultural commodity “speculation” raises food prices.  “I share your sadness that many people in the world still
live in poverty and suffer hunger,” Deutsche Bank Chief
Executive OfficerJosef Ackermann said in a letter to the
organization yesterday. The lender will examine a Foodwatch
study and should sufficient evidence be found of “activities of
Deutsche Bank that could have the consequences you describe, we
will take the appropriate action,” he wrote. Company spokesman
Armin Niedermeier confirmed his comments.  Foodwatch published Ackermann’s comments in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
