Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd., an
Indian steelmaker, plans to raise a total of $1.2 billion in
rupees and dollars, according to a person familiar with the
matter.  The company will borrow $410 million for eight years, and
seek 39 billion rupees ($786 million) of 12-year loans, the
person said, declining to be identified because the matter is
private.  Twenty-two lenders are participating in the rupee facility,
and nine in the dollar borrowing, the person said. The loans
will fund expansion of a steel plant in the south-eastern Indian
state of Orissa, according to the person.  Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB)  is arranging the lending, the person said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
