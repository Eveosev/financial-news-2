KeyCorp (KEY) , Ohio’s second-biggest bank,
said third-quarter profit fell 1 percent, beating analysts’
estimates as bad loans declined.  Net income fell to $217 million, or 22 cents a diluted
share, from $219 million, or 20 cents, in the same period a year
earlier, the Cleveland-based company said today in a statement.
The average estimate of 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for earnings per share of 21 cents.  KeyCorp, led by Chief Executive Officer Beth Mooney, has
declined 25 percent this year as regional banks contend with
lagging loan demand with economic growth stagnates and U.S.
unemployment remaining above 9 percent.  We continue “executing our relationship strategy,
improving  credit quality  and maintaining disciplined expense
control,” Mooney said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
