Holding Tonicorp SA, an Ecuadorean
dairy producer and distributor, seeks to raise $74 million in
the country’s biggest initial public offering in five years,
said Denisse Nankervis, head of the brokerage handling the sale.  Tonicorp, based in Guayaquil, plans to sell a 30 percent
stake for $6 a share on exchanges in Quito and Guayaquil,
Nankervis, the chief executive officer of Inmovalor Casa de
Valores SA, said today in a telephone interview. The milk
producer will begin the sale on Oct. 26 and may increase the
offering to 49 percent of shares, she said.  The company, controlled by the Alarcon family, began
producing plastics in 1967 and added dairy products and a
distribution arm in the 1970s, according to its  website . The
Alarcons are now selling shares in a bid to transform the
company from a family-owned enterprise into a larger business
capable of outliving its founders, Nankervis said.  “The market for dairy products is strong and Toni is known
as one of the principal dairy providers” in  Ecuador , Nankervis
said. “We’ve had quite a bit of appetite for the shares because
there aren’t many new equities trading on the exchange.”  Ecuadorean companies sold $200,000 worth of stock on local
exchanges this year as of June, according to the most recent
data from the nation’s Superintendent of Companies. A $74
million sale would be the biggest since at least 2006, when the
agency began recording comparable data.  Tonicorp owns Plasticos Ecuatorianos SA, Industrias Lacteas
Toni SA and Dipor SA, which produce, package and distribute the
company’s dairy products. Growing demand and “strong”  brand
recognition  in the South American country should boost sales by
51 percent by 2016, Nankervis said.  Tonicorp’s three companies are forecast to have combined
sales of $380 million in 2016, up from a projected $252 million
this year, she said. Net profit is expected to be $18.3 million
in 2011 and $18.7 million next year, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
