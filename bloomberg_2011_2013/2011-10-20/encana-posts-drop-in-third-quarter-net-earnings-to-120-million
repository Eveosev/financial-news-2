Encana Corp. (ECA) ,  Canada ’s biggest
natural-gas producer, said third-quarter profit declined 80
percent as the decline in the Canadian dollar resulted in
currency losses.  Net income slumped to $120 million, or 16 cents a share,
from $606 million, or 80 cents, a year earlier, Calgary-based
Encana said today in a statement. Excluding currency losses and
gains from contracts used to lock in commodity prices, the
company earned 23 cents a share, more than double the 11-cent
average of 16 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The Canadian dollar declined 7.8 percent against the U.S.
currency in the third quarter. The company had $310 million in
cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter, down from
$1.4 billion a year ago. Sales fell 3 percent to $2.35 billion.  “Encana is going to have to have more joint ventures or
asset sales next year if they don’t want to take on more debt,”
said  John Malone , an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities LLC in
New York who has a neutral rating and doesn’t own the stock. The
company needs to raise about $1 billion from such transactions
next year, he said.  Encana fell 0.5 percent to C$20.44 at the close in Toronto.
The stock, which has eight buy, two sell and 16 hold ratings
from analysts, has dropped 30 percent this year.  The company is selling assets to fund more profitable
operations. It announced agreements this month to sell a portion
of its Piceance pipeline system and a stake in the Cabin Gas
Plant in British Columbia for about $800 million.  Joint Ventures  It has also agreed to joint ventures to help fund
development. The company expanded an agreement with Korea Gas
Corp. for drilling in the Horn River gas area in July. A
proposed C$5.4 billion ($5.3 billion) agreement with PetroChina
Co. fell apart in June.  Gas output rose 5.8 percent to 3.37 billion cubic feet a
day in the third quarter from 3.18 billion cubic feet a year
earlier. Production of gas liquids, which include ethane, butane
and propane, rose 4.2 percent to 24,377 barrels a day and the
company said it plans to triple production to about 80,000
barrels by 2015.  “We are planning to direct an increasing portion of our
investment to grow our oil and natural-gas liquids production,”
Chief Executive Officer Randy Eresman said in the statement
today.  Industry Costs Rise  Encana expects industry costs to rise as much as 12 percent
this year as competition for drilling and pumping service crews
increases, Eresman said in July. The company has been reducing
expenses and using financial contracts to fix commodity prices
to guard against fluctuations.  Gas futures have sold at an average of $4.168 per million
British thermal units this year in  New York , down from a high of
$13.577 in July 2008.  Encana and its partners are discussing possible sales
agreements with customers in  Asia  for their liquefied natural
gas project in Kitimat, British Columbia. The plant won an
export license from Canada’s energy regulator on Oct. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
