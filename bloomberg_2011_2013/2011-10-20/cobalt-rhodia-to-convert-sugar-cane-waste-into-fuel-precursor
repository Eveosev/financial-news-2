Cobalt Technologies Inc., a closely
held developer of biobutanol fermentation technology, will work
with Rhodia SA to convert sugar-cane waste in  Latin America  into
a chemical that can be processed into fuel.  The companies plan to test Cobalt’s technology at an
existing sugar-cane mill in Brazil and then build refineries
alongside mills in other parts of the region, Mountain View,
California-based Cobalt said yesterday in a statement. Cobalt’s
process converts bagasse, the stems and stalks that remain after
cane is crushed, into bio n-butanol, which can be used in
paints, lacquers and other surface coatings or converted into
jet fuel, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
