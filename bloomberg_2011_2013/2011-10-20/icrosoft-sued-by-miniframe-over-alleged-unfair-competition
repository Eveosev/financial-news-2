Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the world’s largest
software maker, was sued by Israel-based MiniFrame Ltd. for
allegedly offering anticompetitive terms for multiserver
operating systems.  MiniFrame said Microsoft uses its monopoly on the client
operating-system market to interfere with potential partners and
customers. Before 2007, Microsoft didn’t include any
restrictions in its licenses that would prevent multiple users,
MiniFrame said in a complaint filed today in  Manhattan  federal
court.  MiniFrame alleges that Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
is attempting to retain its monopoly on the server operating-
system market and the client operating-system market and is
attempting to monopolize the personal-computer sharing software
market and the multi-user software market.  “Microsoft recognized the competitive threat which shared
PC systems posed and engaged in several anticompetitive
strategies in order to ensure that it will maintain or otherwise
have a monopoly for any multi-user market, whether it be the
server operating system market, the PC sharing software market,
or the combination of the two markets,” MiniFrame said.  MiniFrame said there no technological reason multiple users
can’t access or use the same Windows Client Operating System at
the same time.  A Microsoft representative didn’t immediately return a
voice-mail message seeking comment about the complaint.  The case is MiniFrame v. Microsoft Corp. 11-CV-7419, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
