Volvo Car Corp., the Swedish
automaker owned by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., said it
swung to a loss in the third quarter because of spending on
new technology and negative currency effects.  Volvo had an operating loss of 763 million kronor ($116
million) in the period, compared with 748 million kronor in
earnings before interest and taxes a year ago, the Gothenburg,
Sweden-based company said today in a statement. Volvo was
profitable in the first nine months and expects to report a
positive result for the full year, it said.  “There are concerns about  consumer confidence  given the
turbulence of financial markets,” Chief Executive Officer
 Stefan Jacoby  said in the statement. “At the same time I’m very
pleased about the positive sales developments and the strength
of our brand, and the outlook for 2011 remains positive.”  Volvo aims to more than double annual sales to 800,000
vehicles by 2020 and challenge luxury-car leaders Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG, Volkswagen AG’s Audi and Daimler AG’s
Mercedes. It plans to invest as much as $11 billion over the
next five years to tap demand in markets including  China , where
it’s building a factory in Chengdu and a research and
development center.  Revenue rose 5.9 percent to 26.9 billion kronor in the
quarter, while car sales gained almost 28 percent to 103,119
vehicles. Volvo increased its market share in all regions
compared with a year earlier.  Volvo warned on Aug. 17 that economic instability could hit
auto demand in the second half. Ford Motor Co. sold Volvo to
Geely last year for about $1.5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
