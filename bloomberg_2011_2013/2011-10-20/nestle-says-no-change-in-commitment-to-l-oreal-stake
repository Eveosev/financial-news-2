Nestle SA (NESN)  said a legal ruling on
 L’Oreal SA (OR)  heiress Liliane Bettencourt doesn’t change an
agreement the Swiss company has regarding its stake in the
business, Nestle Chief Executive Officer Paul Bulcke said at a
press conference today. The Swiss company doesn’t need to make a
decision on its holding before 2014 and remains committed to the
stake, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
