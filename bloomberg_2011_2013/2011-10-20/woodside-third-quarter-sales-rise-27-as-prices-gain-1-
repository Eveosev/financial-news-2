Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) ,  Australia ’s
second-largest oil and gas producer, said third-quarter sales
rose 27 percent driven by higher prices.  Sales gained to $1.31 billion in the three months ended
Sept. 30, from $1.03 billion a year earlier, Perth-based
Woodside said today in a statement. Production fell 12 percent
to 16.1 million barrels of oil equivalent, it said  Woodside, led by Chief Executive Officer Peter Coleman who
took control in May, plans to develop an estimated $75 billion
($78 billion) in Australian liquefied natural gas projects with
partners including BP Plc. Output in the quarter dropped, partly
because of shutdowns at the North West Shelf project and lower
volumes at the Enfield and Laminaria-Corallina fields, it said.  “Woodside’s 2011 production target remains between 62 and
64 million barrels of oil equivalent,” the company said.  Woodside rose 2 percent to A$34.28 in Sydney trading. It
has dropped 20 percent this year.  The first cargo from the Pluto liquefied natural gas
project is scheduled for March next year and talks continue for
its expansion, Woodside said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
