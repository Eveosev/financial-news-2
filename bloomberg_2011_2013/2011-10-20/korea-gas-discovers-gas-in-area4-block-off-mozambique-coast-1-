Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the world’s biggest
importer of liquefied natural gas, found gas off the coast of
Mozambique, the South Korean government said.  The state-run utility known as Kogas made the discovery at
one of four deepwater wells in the Area4 block operated by
Italy’s  Eni SpA (ENI) , the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The block may hold at least 15 trillion cubic feet of gas,
equivalent to about 340 million metric tons of the fuel,
according to the statement. Eni owns 70 percent of the area,
while Kogas holds a 10 percent stake, the ministry said.  Kogas gained 1.1 percent to close at 35,700 won in Seoul
trading, outperforming a 2.7 percent slump in the benchmark
 Kospi index. (KOSPI)  The ministry announced the Mozambique discovery
after the stock market shut.  South Korea consumes about 34 million tons of natural gas a
year, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
