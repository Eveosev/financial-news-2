Diesel fuel in the Midwest
strengthened amid speculation that refinery maintenance may
curtail production as farmers use more fuel to harvest crops.  CVR Energy Inc. (CVI)  planned to shut a crude unit and catalytic
cracker starting early this month at the Coffeyville, Kansas,
refinery, Steve Eames, a company spokesman, said in a Sept. 20
e-mail.  “There’s not lot of product coming off the  Gulf Coast  and
it’s agriculture season,” said Steve Mosby, vice president of
ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in Kansas City, Missouri.
“Diesel in the group is just tight.”  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Midwest, or
Group 3, gained 1.38 cents to 7.13 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 4:08 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
6.27 cents to $3.1014 a gallon.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
same region gained 0.87 cent to 5.25 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
