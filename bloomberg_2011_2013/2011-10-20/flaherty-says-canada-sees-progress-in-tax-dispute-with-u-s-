Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  said his government is trying to negotiate “leniency”
on potential penalties that U.S. citizens living in Canada may
be asked to pay for not filing tax returns in the U.S.  Flaherty, speaking to lawmakers in Ottawa, said he is
seeing some “progress” on the issue with U.S. officials.  Dual citizens must file annual U.S. tax returns and
complete a separate yearly IRS filing if they have Canadian or
other non-U.S. financial accounts of more than $10,000, under
Internal Revenue Service rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
