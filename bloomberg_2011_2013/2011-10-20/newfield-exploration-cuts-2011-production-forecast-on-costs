Newfield Exploration Co. (NFX) , the
petroleum producer with properties from the U.S. Rocky Mountains
to  China , cut its 2011 production forecast as it reported third-
quarter earnings 12 cents below analysts’ estimates.  Production was affected by increasing service costs that
prompted the company to cut back its activities in  North
Dakota ’s Williston Basin. Newfield, based in The Woodlands,
 Texas , has reduced its rig count in the basin and is delaying
the completion of 13 wells until early 2012.  Asset sales, adverse weather in the  Gulf of Mexico  and
reduced spending in some areas also contributed to the lower
production forecast, the company said.  Newfield now sees production this year at the equivalent of
300 billion cubic feet of gas to 304 billion cubic feet, down
from a previous range of 312 billion cubic feet to 316 billion
cubic feet, the company said in a statement.  Third-quarter net income rose 67 percent to $269 million,
or $1.99 a share, compared with $161 million, or $1.20 a share,
from the same period a year ago. Profit included a $129 million
after-tax gain related to energy contract gains that boosted
earnings by 95 cents a share in the quarter.  Excluding the one-time gain, Newfield’s profit was $1.04 a
share, 12 cents less than the $1.16 a share average of 26
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company said sales of “non-strategic assets” totaled
$200 million so far this year, and it plans additional sales for
total proceeds of $400 million to $550 million by the end of the
year.  Newfield fell 1.3 percent to $41.50 at 7:35 p.m. in after-
hours trading in New York  To contact the reporter on this story:
