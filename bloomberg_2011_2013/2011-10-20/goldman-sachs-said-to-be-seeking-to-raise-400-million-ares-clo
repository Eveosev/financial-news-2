Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  is seeking
to raise a collateralized loan obligation with a target size of
$400 million to be managed by Ares Management LLC, according to
three people with knowledge of the deal.  The CLO may include a $254 million piece rated AAA by
 Standard & Poorâ€™s , said the people, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private. Bank of America Corp.
priced a $410 million CLO for the Los Angeles-based investment
manager in January.  There have been more than $7.6 billion of CLOs backed by
widely syndicated loans raised in the U.S. this year, more than
double the $3.4 billion raised in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. At the peak of the market in 2007, $91.1
billion of that type of CLO was issued in the U.S., Morgan
Stanley data show.  The Ares fund may also consist of a $23 million slice rated
AA, a $40 million piece ranked A, a $21 million portion graded
BBB and an $18 million BB piece. There may also be $44 million
of equity, the people said.  Michael DuVally , a Goldman Sachs
spokesman, and Bill Mendel, an Ares spokesman, both declined to
comment.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return. The S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100
Index, which tracks the 100 largest dollar- denominated first-
lien leveraged loans, has climbed 1.5 cents since September to
90.06 cents on the dollar, the highest level since Aug. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
