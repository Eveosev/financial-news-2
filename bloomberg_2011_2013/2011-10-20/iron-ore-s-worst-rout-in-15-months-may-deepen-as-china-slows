Iron ore’s biggest decline in 15
months may worsen as the economy slows in China, the largest
importer, the European debt crisis persists and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) 
and  Rio Tinto  Group increase production, analysts said.  Ore for immediate delivery may drop to $140 a metric ton by
year-end, according to Macquarie Group Ltd. analyst Bonnie Liu
in Shanghai. That’s down 5.2 percent from $147.70 yesterday,
data from The Steel Index Ltd. show. The price may fall to the
mid to low $140s, said Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.  China, the world’s biggest steelmaker, grew at the slowest
pace since 2009 in the third quarter on weaker export demand and
monetary tightening as steel prices dropped to a 10-month low
and port ore inventories held near a record. Cheaper ore -- also
sold through quarterly contracts -- may limit profit growth at
 Vale SA (VALE3) , Rio Tinto and  BHP Billiton , the largest producers.  “I’m leaning toward lower prices than they are now for the
rest of this year,” Daniel Hynes, a Sydney-based analyst at
Citigroup Inc., said by phone, without giving a forecast. “The
marginal buyers, who have been pretty active in the market this
year, have pulled away.”  Prices of fines with 62 percent iron content delivered to
the port of Tianjin plunged 18 percent in the past six weeks
after reaching $191.90 on Feb. 16, the highest since at least
2008,  The Steel Index  data show. The cash price hasn’t traded at
less than $140 per ton since September 2010. Swaps for December
are at $126.87 per ton, according to Singapore Exchange Ltd.  Commodities Tumble  Industrial metals from copper to zinc and lead tumbled 17
percent in the past six weeks, according the London Metal
Exchange index, on concern the European debt crisis would erode
demand and after  China  tightened monetary policy to cool prices.
The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities retreated 12
percent in September, the most in almost three years.  Crude-steel production in China fell in September to 56.7
million tons, the lowest level in seven months, according to
data from the National Bureau of Statistics and compiled by
Bloomberg. Output reached a record 60.3 million tons in May.  Angang Steel Co., the largest Hong Kong-listed steelmaker,
plans to halt a blast furnace for one-and-half months because of
weakening demand, board secretary Fu Jihui said Oct. 18. The
company said Oct. 14 that its net income in the first nine
months of the year may have fallen 91 percent.  Buying Delay  “In the next month, there are no triggers for me to say
prices should rebound strongly,”  Mark Pervan , Melbourne-based
head of commodity research at ANZ, said by phone yesterday.
“Prices could have another $10 a ton drop toward the mid- to
low $140s, which would be the floor. Then you could see a 5
percent to 10 percent rebound at the end of December back up to
$160 when seasonal factors kick in.”  Jiangsu Shagang Group Co., China’s biggest non-state-owned
steelmaker, may delay ore purchases should steel output need to
be cut, Vice President Shen Wenming said in an Oct. 17 interview.
Shen described China’s steel market as “very bad.”  Steel prices in China have dropped to a 10-month low as the
economy expanded 9.1 percent in the third quarter, the slowest
pace in two years, demand from construction moderated. The price
of Chinese rolled coil steel has fallen 10 percent since Sept. 2
and was trading at 4,357 yuan ($683) a ton yesterday.  Iron-ore inventories held at China’s ports reached a record
98.7 million tons in August, according to researcher  Shanghai 
Steelhome Information. The holdings totaled 96.3 million tons on
the week of Oct. 14.  More Exports  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , who chairs
the group of euro-area finance ministers, indicated a meeting of
European leaders in Frankfurt yesterday failed to resolve
differences ahead of a summit this weekend.  Europe ’s leaders are
looking to maximize the firepower of the 440 billion-euro
($605.5 billion) fund to contain the region’s debt crisis.  There’s no shortage of supply.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) 
saw shipments rise 21 percent in the three months to Sept. 30.
Australia’s third-biggest producer is spending $8.4 billion to
almost triple export capacity to 155 million tons a year.  BHP, the world’s largest mining company, said yesterday
that iron-ore production was a record 39.57 million tons in the
three months to Sept. 30. Rio, the second-largest miner, said
Oct. 13 that output rose 5 percent to 49.8 million tons in the
third quarter. Anglo American Plc said today that production
increased 3 percent to 12.2 million tons.  Melbourne-based BHP is spending $7.4 billion on operations
in Western  Australia ’s Pilbara region to increase output to 220
million tons by 2014. Rio may spend about $15 billion on
expanding capacity in the region by about 50 percent by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
