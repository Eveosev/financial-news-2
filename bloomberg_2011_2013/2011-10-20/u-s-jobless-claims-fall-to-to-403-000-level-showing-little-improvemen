The number of Americans filing
applications for  unemployment benefits  declined last week to a
level that shows little improvement in the labor market since
the start of the year.  Jobless claims dropped by 6,000 to 403,000 in the week
ended Oct. 15, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
called for a drop to 400,000 applications. The four-week average
fell to the lowest level since April.  Some companies are still paring their workforces at the
same time demand has fallen short of the level that may spur
businesses to expand staff. The lack of employment growth, which
is limiting  consumer spending  and restraining the recovery,
underscores the challenge for President Barack Obama, who is
trying to push Congress to pass parts of his jobs initiative.  “We’re running in place,” said  Scott Brown , chief
economist at Raymond James & Associates Inc. in  St. Petersburg ,
 Florida , who projected 405,000 claims. The data are “consistent
with lackluster to moderate growth in the job market and the
economy,” he said.  The number of people on unemployment benefit rolls rose,
while those receiving extended payments fell, today’s report
showed.  Jobless benefits applications were projected to decline
from 404,000 initially reported for the prior week, according to
the median forecast of 46 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Claims at the end of 2010 stood at 418,000. Estimates ranged
from 390,000 to 420,000. The Labor Department revised the prior
week’s figure up to 409,000.  Stock-Index Futures  Stock-index futures held earlier gains after the report.
The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December climbed 0.5 percent to 1,212.6 at 8:41 a.m. in  New
York .  Today’s data showed the four-week moving average, a less
volatile measure than the weekly figures, dropped to 403,000
last week, the lowest since the period ended April 16.  The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits
rose 25,000 in the week ended Oct. 8 to 3.72 million. They were
forecast to increase to 3.69 million.  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments fell by about 68,000
to 3.48 million in the week ended Oct. 1.  Unemployment Rate  The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, held at 2.9 percent,
today’s report showed.  Forty-nine states and territories reported an increase in
claims, while four reported a decrease. These data are reported
with a one-week lag.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Businesses slashing staff include  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,
this year’s worst performer in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average .
The  Charlotte , North Carolina-based lender is cutting 30,000
jobs, including at its unit servicing mortgages.  The legacy asset servicing business is “at its peak
staffing level,” Chief Financial Officer  Bruce Thompson  said in
a conference call on Oct. 18. “So more of that overall staffing
reduction should come through the bottom line.”  Some companies may see more employment over time.  Ford
Motor Co. (F) ’s U.S. hourly workers yesterday voted 63 percent in
favor of a four-year contract that creates 12,000 new jobs and
gives each as much as $10,000 in payments this year, according
to the United Auto Workers.  Obama is seeking to get lawmakers to pass individual
provisions of his jobs proposal, after the Senate voted Oct. 10
to block the package of tax cuts and spending aimed to spur
employment and economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
