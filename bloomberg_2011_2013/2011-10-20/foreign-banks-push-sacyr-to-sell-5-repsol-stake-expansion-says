Foreign banks that represent 20
percent of the loan  Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  used to finance its
stake in  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  are pressing the Spanish builder to sell
a 5 percent stake in the oil company,  Expansion  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Sacyr is trying to find replacements for the foreign banks
as it seeks to refinance the loan, Expansion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
