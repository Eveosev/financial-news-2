Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard  urged economists to bridge the gap
between research on theoretical and policy issues.  “Advanced economic theory has to be made more relevant for
actual policy, and actual policy has to understand and embrace
the difficult ideas advanced in the theoretical world,” Bullard
said today at a conference at the bank. The St. Louis Fed “has
long been a leader in supporting basic research at the
intersection of economic theory and economic policy.”  Bullard didn’t discuss the economy or monetary policy in
his prepared remarks. He yesterday said monetary policy was
“appropriately easy” and the U.S. is likely to avoid a second
recession following the decline that ended two years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
