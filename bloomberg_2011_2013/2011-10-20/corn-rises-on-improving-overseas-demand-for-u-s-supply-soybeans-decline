Corn futures posted their biggest
gain in more than a week on signs that last month’s price drop
revived demand for supplies from the U.S., the world’s biggest
exporter. Soybeans fell for a fourth straight day.  U.S. exporters sold 1.763 million metric tons of corn in
the week ended Oct. 13, the most since March, the Department of
Agriculture said today in a report. Total  sales  for delivery
before Aug. 31 are 5 percent higher than at the same time last
year and are at the highest level in four years. Last week, the
USDA forecast a 13 percent drop in this season’s shipments.  The “USDA looks a little too pessimistic on U.S. export
sales this year,” Marty Foreman, an economist at Doane Advisory
Services Co. in  St. Louis , said in a telephone interview.
“Export demand is a little stronger than the government
expected.”  Corn futures for December delivery rose 1.7 percent to
close at $6.495 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest gain since Oct. 11. Prices fell 23 percent in
September on concern that the European debt crisis would slow
demand for food,  animal feed  and fuel.  China, the second-biggest consumer after the U.S., was the
top  buyer  of corn last week, taking more than 51 percent of the
total, USDA data showed. The sale, which was previously
announced by the department last week, pushed China’s cumulative
total to 1.923 million tons, up from 313,700 purchased at the
same time a year earlier. An additional 4.81 million tons have
been sold for delivery before Aug. 31 to unknown destinations.  “The Chinese sales alone argue export sales this year will
be higher than the USDA is forecasting,” Foreman said. “There
are a lot of unknown sales that may end up shipped to  China .”  Soybeans Drop  Soybeans fell after the USDA said U.S. export sales dropped
12 percent to 594,743 tons in the week ended Oct. 13 from a week
earlier. Shipments were down 71 percent from a year earlier.
Total sales for delivery before Aug. 31 are 29 percent below the
pace of last season and are at the lowest level in three years,
USDA  data  show.  Soybean futures for January delivery fell less than 0.1
percent to $12.305 a bushel on the CBOT. The price surged 9.6
percent last week on speculation that China, the largest
importer, may boost purchases from the U.S.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
