Audi,  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s luxury-car
unit, may more than double production in the world’s largest
automobile market in four years to meet rising demand for high-
end passenger cars, its  China  chief said yesterday.  The company plans to expand annual manufacturing capacity
in China to as high as 700,000 vehicles by 2015 depending on
market demand, from 300,000 units now, said Dietmar Voggenreiter, Audi’s China president. The automaker is
considering building a second plant in addition to the one in
Changchun, he said, declining to specify the investment amount
or the plant’s location.  “You see a lot of young customers and young families now
buying premium cars,” Voggenreiter said in an interview in
Changchun city in northeast China yesterday. “Nowadays, the
upper middle-management customers are growing and this is our
main customer focus.”  The automaker, whose headquarters are in Ingolstadt,
 Germany , is counting on China, its largest market, to help it
overtake Munich-based  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  in global
luxury-car sales by 2015. Audi accounts for about one-third of
the luxury-car market in China, outselling BMW and  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s
Mercedes-Benz, according to J.D. Power & Associates.  Audi, BMW and Mercedes are targeting record sales this
year, helped by China. The world’s second-largest economy will
grow 9.5 percent this year, six times the pace of the U.S. and
euro area, according to International Monetary Fund estimates
released last month.  Vibrant Lineup  Audi may produce an electric car in China, said
Voggenreiter, who has headed the carmaker in China since
November 2006. The company makes the A4L, A6L sedans and Q5
sport-utility vehicles with its partner China FAW Group Corp.  “While Audi has a strong reputation amongst Chinese
consumers, it needs a more vibrant lineup,” said Namrita Chow,
a senior analyst at IHS Automotive in  Shanghai . “Wealthy
Chinese consumers are increasingly aware of luxury brands, and
younger consumers are looking for different variants.”  Audi, headed by Chief Executive Officer Rupert Stadler,
said last month it expects China deliveries in 2011 to exceed
300,000 vehicles for the first time. Audi sold 223,631 cars in
China during the first nine months of the year, an increase of
29 percent from 2010, the company said in an e-mail. The German
carmaker aims to sell 360,000 next year, IHS’s Chow said.  Losing Share  Voggenreiter declined to comment on 2012 sales, saying only
that he was “optimistic” about the market. Audi will introduce
its full range of products in China to boost import sales, he
said.  Audi, maker of the 355,000-yuan ($55,650) A6L, China’s top-
selling car since 1999, was the first luxury automaker in the
country when it entered the market 23 years ago. Its share of
the high-end market has fallen to about 30 percent in the first
half of 2011 from 40 percent in 2009 as BMW and Mercedes boosted
production and introduced new models, according to  J.D. Power .  BMW’s market share has risen to 25 percent from 21 percent
in 2009, while Mercedes has 22 percent, up from 16 percent, data
from J.D. Power show. Audi’s sales will rise 24 percent in 2011,
trailing BMW’s 60 percent growth and Mercedes’s 42 percent,
according to the researcher.  Audi sales were affected by a temporary stoppage at its
Changchun factory in the first quarter after the automaker
upgraded its facilities to boost capacity, Voggenreiter said.  “We are back on track now,” he said. “We had to have a
pit stop. After the pit stop, with new tires, we will make new
time records.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
