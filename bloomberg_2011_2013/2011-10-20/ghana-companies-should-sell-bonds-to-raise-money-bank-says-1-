Ghanaian companies should sell bonds
to raise money and reduce their dependence on loans, said Kwesi Amissah-Arthur, governor of the central bank of West Africa’s
second-biggest economy.  Market conditions and the economic environment in the West
African nation “are ripe” for companies to sell bonds, he told
a conference in Accra, the capital, today.  Changes made by the  Bank of Ghana  to the primary-dealership
bond market and extension of maturities on offer to five years
from three years was in part to create an environment for a
“corporate-bonds market to thrive,” he said.  The central bank in April introduced a minimum capital
requirement of 5 million cedis ($3.1 million) for primary bond
dealers, slashing the number of participating banks to 15 from
more than 25 banks, Amissah-Arthur said.  Companies can sell bonds at lower costs as  Ghana ’s Treasury
bill rate, which may be used as a benchmark indicator for
corporate debt, has declined, he said.  Ghana’s  three-month borrowing costs  at the most recent
auction, held on Oct. 14, dropped to 9.25 percent from 9.32
percent a week earlier, the third-straight decline, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Volta River Authority , a state-owned electricity
utility, plans to raise $400 million in bond offers over the
next two years to fund power generation, Chief Executive Officer
Kweku Awotwi said at the conference. The company needs double
that amount to improve efficiency and boost electricity output,
he said. “We will issue equity to investors in some few years
to come.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
