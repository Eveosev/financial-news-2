Talks between  Georgia  and Russia on
the Russian bid to join the  World Trade Organization  made no
progress at the latest meeting in Geneva, Georgian Deputy
Foreign Minister Sergi Kapanadze said.  Negotiations will continue early next week, Kapanadze said
today by phone.  Switzerland in March started mediating negotiations between
the two countries, which fought a five-day war in 2008 over the
breakaway Georgian region of  South Ossetia . Georgia has cited
disputes over customs checkpoints in South Ossetia and another
breakaway region, Abkhazia, as reasons to withhold its approval
for Russian WTO membership.  Russia, the largest economy outside the WTO, has been
seeking to join the Geneva-based trade arbiter since June 1993,
surpassing the 15 years  China  had to wait before becoming a
member. While talks with the U.S. and the European Union on
Russiaâ€™s entry are close to finalization, its southern neighbor
Georgia, already a member, has blocked its accession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
