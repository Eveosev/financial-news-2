Actelion Ltd. (ATLN) , Europe’s largest
biotechnology company, said it expects drug sales to fall next
year as it faces pricing pressure and increased competition in
the U.S.  Product sales may decline in the low- to mid-single-digit
range in local currencies, the Allschwil, Switzerland-based
company said in a statement.  Third-quarter revenue fell to 401.8 million Swiss francs
($443 million) from 445.7 million francs a year earlier,
Actelion said today. That missed the average of 415.8 million
francs of 12 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “We are evaluating all possible options to mitigate the
effect of currency on our reported results,” Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Oakley said in the statement. “Over the next
twelve months we will also make appropriate capital allocation
decisions based on operating performance as well as the outcome
of upcoming clinical studies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
