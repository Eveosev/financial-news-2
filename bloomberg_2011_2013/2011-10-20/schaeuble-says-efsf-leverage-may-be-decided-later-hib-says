German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  told budget committee lawmakers today that a decision
on leveraging the European Financial Stability Facility to
increase its firepower could be taken “later” because there is
still a need to iron out differences over issues including the
EFSF’s bond buying in the primary and secondary markets,
parliament’s HIB newsletter said in Berlin by e-mail.  The newsletter didn’t specify any timetable envisaged by
Schaeuble for the decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
