OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-largest
oil producer, may sell its Odessa oil refinery in Ukraine after
shutting it last year because of poor market conditions.  The Moscow-based oil producer is looking at options for the
refinery, including “studying a possible sale” if the
Ukrainian market for oil products doesn’t improve, Gennady
Fedotov, vice president for economics and planning, told
reporters today in Moscow.  Ukrainian plants have faced competition from product
imports made in neighboring countries, like Belarus, that have
access to cheaper crude oil, the  International Energy Agency 
said earlier this year. Additionally, Ukraine has changed
direction of oil flows on a pipe that previously fed the plant.  Lukoil closed the plant for maintenance in October 2010 and
has yet to open it as it can’t get crude supplies at an
acceptable price, Lukoil’s press service said by telephone
today. Fedotov didn’t name any potential buyers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
