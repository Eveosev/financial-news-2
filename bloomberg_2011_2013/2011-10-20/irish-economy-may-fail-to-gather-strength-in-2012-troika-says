Ireland’s economy may fail to gather
strength next year as a global slowdown hurts exports and
consumers hold back spending, the latest report by the country’s
bailout partners showed.   “Growth in the first half of 2011 was stronger than
expected,” the so-called troika of officials from the  European
Central Bank , the European Commission and the  International
Monetary Fund  said in an e-mailed report today. “But the
slowdown in key trading partners is likely to cool Ireland’s
export growth,” while “domestic demand is expected to contract
slightly faster than was projected” previously. “These factors
will dampen the economic recovery with real GDP growth rate
expected to be about 1 percent in both 2011 and 2012.”  Ireland’s implementation of its bailout program “continues
to be strong” and the government is expected to meet its budget
deficit target for this year of 10.5 percent, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
