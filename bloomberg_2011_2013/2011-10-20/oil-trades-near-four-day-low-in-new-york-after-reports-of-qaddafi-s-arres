Oil traded near its lowest in four
days in  New York , giving up gains following reports that deposed
Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi was arrested by rebel forces.  West Texas Intermediate crude was little changed on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, erasing an earlier gain of 1 percent.
Prices had risen on speculation European Union leaders will
reach agreement on enhancing their rescue fund. Libyan ruling
council fighters captured Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte, Al
Jazeera television reported, citing unidentified people.  “These are political markets right now,” said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst in Frankfurt at Commerzbank AG. The bank was
the fourth most-accurate forecaster of Brent prices in the third
quarter. “Risk aversion is back.”  Crude for December delivery on Nymex, the most-actively
traded contract, was down 10 cents at $86.19 a barrel as of
12:38 p.m.  London  time. The contract earlier rose 1 percent to
$87.12. Brent crude for December settlement was up 0.4 percent
at $108.85 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London, paring an earlier 1.2 percent gain.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
