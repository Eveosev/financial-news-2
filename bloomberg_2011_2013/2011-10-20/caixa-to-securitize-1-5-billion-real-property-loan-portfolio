Brazil ’s Caixa Economica Federal
said it signed a contract to sell 1.5 billion reais ($834
million) of mortgage-backed certificates to the workers’
compensation fund it manages, known as FGTS.  Caixa will use the proceeds to generate new real-estate
loans, the state-controlled bank said in an e-mailed statement.  FGTS may spend as much as 2.84 billion reais on buying so-
called CRI certificates in 2011, according to the statement.  The fund also plans to buy 700 million reais of the
securities from Banco Santander SA and 578 million reais from
Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Sao Paulo-based Valor Economico
