Chairman  Jim O’Neill  said it’s unlikely that the  U.S. economy 
will slip back into recession.   “There appears to be this mood around of inevitability
about the next quarter that we’re back into recession or close
to it,” O’Neill said in an interview on CNBC today. “I don’t
really buy. Most of the ongoing reliable data is quite strong.
There’s no momentum for a recession.”  “It certainly seems that the U.S. is struggling with trend
growth, but something” about 2 percent “strikes me as the
cruising speed the U.S. is at now,” the economist told CNBC.
There will need to be “a lot of negative shocks going on to
drag the U.S. down,” he said.  O’Neill also said that “people seem to be convinced that
 Europe  going wrong is going to drag the U.S. down. That’s might
happen, but there’s a strong likelihood it won’t.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
