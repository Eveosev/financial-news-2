More migrants left  New Zealand  than
arrived for the sixth month in the past seven, extending the
biggest exodus in a decade, after residents were uprooted by an
earthquake in the South Island city of Christchurch.  Permanent migrant departures exceeded arrivals by 660 in
September, the most since February 2001,  Statistics New Zealand 
said in Wellington today. In the year to Sept. 30, net arrivals
declined to 773, also the lowest in a decade, from 2,257 in the
12 months through August.  Slower immigration may weigh on consumption and housing in
New Zealand, giving central bank Governor Alan Bollard reason to
maintain a record-low benchmark interest rate of 2.5 percent
until rebuilding accelerates. Earlier this week, he said
reconstruction should provide “significant stimulus” in the
medium term.  “The weakness in net migration highlights ongoing weakness
in total domestic consumer demand, and the lack of urgency to
increase the official cash rate,”  Jane Turner , economist at ASB
Bank Ltd. in Auckland, said in an e-mailed note.  The Feb. 22 temblor killed 181 people, wrecked houses,
split roads and shut businesses. The rebuild is likely to cost
about NZ$20 billion ($15.9 billion), equivalent of 10 percent of
gross domestic product, Bollard said Oct. 18.  Christchurch residents departing permanently overseas rose
to 5,500 in from March through September from 3,300 in the same
period last year, the statistics agency said.  Australia Beckons  Many of those departing go without migration restrictions
to Australia, a country with five times New Zealand’s population
of 4.4 million people that is little more than three hours away
by aircraft and offers higher average wages.  The number of New Zealanders leaving for  Australia  rose 49
percent to 43,766 persons in the year ended Sept. 30 from 29,392
in the year through September 2010.  Short-term visitor arrivals surged 26 percent from
September last year, boosted by fans attending the Rugby  World
Cup , which began last month and ends Oct. 23, the report showed.  About 74,400 visitors in September said they came for the
tournament, the agency said. About 95,000 foreign fans are
forecast to attend the tournament, bolstering the  tourism
industry , which makes up about 9 percent of the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
