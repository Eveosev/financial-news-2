Spanish 10-year bonds fell for a
ninth day, leading the securities of  Europe ’s highly indebted
nations lower, as demand dropped at its first debt sale since
Moody’s Investors Service cut the country’s credit ranking.  Yields on 10-year Italian debt reached 6 percent for the
first time since Aug. 5 even as two people with knowledge of the
transactions said the  European Central Bank  bought the
securities. French two-year notes fell for a third day as the
government sold 9.29 billion euros ($12.7 billion) of debt.
German bunds fell earlier as draft guidelines for a revamped
euro-area bailout fund showed credit lines may be provided for
indebted countries.  “The market is going back to risk-off again,” said Thomas Meissner, head of fixed-income research at DZ Bank AG in
 Frankfurt . “There are also worries about the additional burden
of the expanded rescue package.”  Spanish 10-year yields rose 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 5.53 percent at 4:40 p.m. London time. The
5.5 percent bond due April 2021 dropped 0.95, or 9.50 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 99.72. Italy’s 10-year yield climbed
12 basis points to 6.02 percent.  The yield difference, or spread, between 10-year debt in
 Spain  and Germany expanded 18 basis points to 353 basis points,
the widest since Sept. 26.  Investors submitted bids for 1.76 times the amount of 2021
debt Spain sold today, compared with 1.9 times at the previous
sale of the securities in July. The bid-to-cover ratio for the
2019 notes fell to 2.09 from 2.17 on Sept. 15, data from the
Madrid-based Treasury showed today.  ‘Not Encouraging’  “Not an encouraging Spanish auction,”  Michael Leister , a
fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG in London, wrote today in a
note to clients. The auctions attracted a “lukewarm take-down”
because of “negative Spain-specific news flow ahead of the
auction,” he wrote.  France’s sale of 2 percent notes due September 2013 drew
demand for 2.05 times the amount on offer, versus 2.66 times the
previous time the debt was auctioned on Sept. 15. The government
also sold debt maturing in 2014, 2015 and 2016, and issued
index-linked securities due in 2016, 2022 and 2027.  France’s 10-year yield was four basis points lower at 3.17
percent, while the German bund yield was five basis points lower
at 2.01 percent. The yield difference widened to 119 basis
points today, the most since 1992, according to Bloomberg data.  Under Pressure  France ’s Aaa credit rating is under pressure from
deterioration in debt metrics and the potential for additional
liabilities from Europe’s crisis, Moody’s said Oct. 17. The
nation’s financial strength has weakened because of the global
financial and economic turmoil, making its debt measures the
weakest among its Aaa rated peers, Moody’s said.  Moody’s cut Spain’s credit rating two levels to A1 from Aa2
on Oct. 19, the third reduction in 13 months.  The enhanced rescue fund, called the European Financial
Stability Facility, may be able to offer loans worth up to 10
percent of a member states’ gross domestic product in
precautionary aid, the draft guidelines obtained by Bloomberg
News show. The step, if approved at this weekend’s summit, may
shift intolerable burdens to German taxpayers, said lawmakers
from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition.  ‘No Agreement’  Germany ’s government doesn’t rule out postponing the Oct.
23 summit due to stalling negotiations about the so-called
leveraging of the EFSF, Die Welt reported, citing unidentified
people close to the country’s governing coalition.  Reports of French-German differences over leveraging the
euro area’s rescue fund are exaggerated, a European Union
official told reporters in Brussels today on condition of
anonymity. EU leaders also plan to discuss bank recapitalization
during lunch at the weekend meeting, according to an official.  Fitch Ratings  affirmed  Belgium ’s AA+ rating, with a
negative outlook, saying risks continue to be skewed to the
downside. Yields on 10-year Belgian debt declined three basis
points to 4.42 percent.  German bonds have returned 6.7 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. French debt gained 2.6 percent,
and Italian bonds lost 4.2 percent.  Volatility on Austrian sovereign debt was the highest among
euro-area markets today, according to measures of 10-year bonds,
two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps. The
yield change in the nation’s 10-year bonds was 1.3 times the 90-
day average, the Bloomberg gauge showed.  Austria ’s 10-year yield
dropped six basis points to 3.03 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
