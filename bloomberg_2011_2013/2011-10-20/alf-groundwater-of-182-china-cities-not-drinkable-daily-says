More than half of the groundwater
monitored in 182 Chinese cities by the Ministry of Land and
Resources was classified as bad, meaning the health of
individuals could be harmed, the  China Daily  reported, citing a
report by the ministry.  Groundwater at 57.2 percent of the 4,110 monitoring
stations in 182 cities was classified as bad last year, the
newspaper reported. The quality of groundwater in most northern
and eastern parts of  China  was worse last year than it was in
2009, according to the report. The ministry’s report didn’t
identify locations, according to the newspaper.  Household sewage, industrial pollution, and the overuse of
fertilizers and pesticides has caused further deterioration of
groundwater, the newspaper reported, citing Ma Chaode, former
director of the World Wide Fund for Nature’s fresh-water program
in China.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
