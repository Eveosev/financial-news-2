Home sales in  Brooklyn , New York’s
most populous borough, climbed 18 percent in the third quarter
as rising apartment rents and low  mortgage rates  drove demand
for condominiums in new developments.  Purchases of condos, co-ops, and one- to three-family homes
totaled 2,219, up from 1,879 a year earlier, New York appraiser
 Miller Samuel Inc.  and broker  Prudential Douglas Elliman Real
Estate  said today in a joint report. Sales of newly built condos
surged 65 percent. The median price of all homes sold in the
period rose 5 percent from a year earlier to $510,000.  New condos across the  East River  from  Manhattan  are luring
international buyers and renters who see the properties as
relative bargains, according to  Jonathan Miller , president and
chief executive officer of Miller Samuel. Manhattan apartment
rents rose 4.9 percent in the third quarter, to an average
$2,970 a month after landlord-sponsored concessions, the
companies said in a report last week. Low borrowing costs were
also an incentive for purchases, Miller said.  “Where I see a lot of the kick is on the condo side,” he
said. “I look at the market as gaining firmer footing, and
continuing to improve gradually.”  While home sales have increased, they’re less than half the
peak reached in the third quarter of 2005, according to Miller.  “We’re doing a little better than moving sideways in
Brooklyn, but just barely,” he said.  Sales of all condos jumped 53 percent in the third quarter
from a year earlier to 839 units. The median price was $549,753,
up 6.7 percent from a year earlier. New condo sales, which
totaled 385, had a median price of $590,585, a 7.8 percent jump.  Williamsburg Deals  In the Williamsburg and Greenpoint neighborhoods, where 87
percent of transactions were in new condo developments, 307
homes changed hands, a gain of 68 percent from a year earlier,
according to  Miller Samuel  and Prudential.  About 60 percent of buyers in the Edge, a 565-unit complex
on Williamsburg’s waterfront, came from Manhattan and about half
of those moved from rentals, said Highlyann Krasnow, a partner
with  MNS , the project’s marketing and sales broker.  Sales in the Edge’s two towers have accelerated this year
after a lull that began with the September 2008 bankruptcy of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., according to Krasnow. Buyers
closed on purchases of 184  condos  from May 2008 through the end
of 2010. Since then, 155 deals were completed and another 55 are
under contract, she said.  ‘Good Opportunity’  First-time buyer Andrew Chen moved in July to a 1,600
square-foot (149,000-square-meter), two-bedroom condo in
Williamsburg’s 80 Metropolitan. Chen, 30, had been renting in
Manhattan’s Hell’s Kitchen when he decided to settle down with
his fiancée in an area with more of a neighborhood feel.  The couple started surveying the market in February and saw
two apartments they liked. When they came back ready to buy
about a month later, both units had sold.  “That definitely made an impression on me in realizing if
we don’t move now, we’re going to lose all the good spaces,”
said Chen, who works with technology and media start-ups at the
 New York  City Economic Development Corp. “It worked with our
timing, but it did make me feel much more rushed in wanting to
move fast before we lost a really good opportunity.”  Mark Grossmann, 34, said low mortgage rates and housing
affordability influenced his decision to buy an apartment in the
Edge after he and his wife rented in Williamsburg for two years.
The couple went into contract on a two-bedroom duplex in July
and the deal was completed this week. The price was $1.34
million.  ‘Less to Own’  “We’re paying less to own than we did to rent,” said
Grossmann, a financial planner. “It’s a great environment out
there. If someone is a qualified buyer with good credit and they
have 20 percent to put down, banks are lending.”  Rates for 30-year fixed mortgages declined from 4.6 percent
at the beginning of the third quarter to 4.01 percent in the
week ending Sept. 29, according to  Freddie Mac . Earlier this
month, rates dropped below 4 percent for the first time in the
McLean, Virginia-based mortgage financier’s records.  Deals for co-ops in Brooklyn climbed 0.8 percent from a
year earlier and the median price rose 5 percent, to $315,000,
according to Miller Samuel and Prudential. Sales of one- to
three-family homes climbed 5 percent and the median price was
$539,500, a 3.8 percent increase.  Purchases of luxury properties, defined by Miller Samuel
and Prudential as the top 10 percent of all transactions by
price, rose 19 percent, to 222. The median price was $1.44
million, a 10 percent gain from the third quarter of 2010.  Brooklyn homes stayed on the market an average of 149 days
in the third quarter, up from 109 days a year earlier.  In Queens, the city’s second-most-populous borough, sales
fell 12 percent in the third quarter to 2,743, according to the
joint report. The median price jumped 8.5 percent to $385,000.
Homes stayed on the market an average of 108 days, an 8 percent
increase from a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
