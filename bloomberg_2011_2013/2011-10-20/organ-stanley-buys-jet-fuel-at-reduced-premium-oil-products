Morgan Stanley bought jet-fuel
cargoes at a reduced premium in  Singapore ,  Asia ’s biggest oil-
trading and refining center. Hin Leong Trading Pte extended its
purchases of fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Vitol Group bought two 50,000-barrel cargoes of 92-RON
gasoline from BP Plc in Singapore, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders monitoring transactions on the Platts window.
The Geneva-based trader paid $118.50 a barrel to load between
Nov. 6 and Nov. 10.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought a 25,000 metric-ton, open-
specification naphtha contract for second-half December from
Mabanaft BV at $884 a ton, the survey showed.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
dropped $29.74 to $59.90 a ton at 5:45 p.m. Singapore time,
based on data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, is the narrowest so far this week.  Middle Distillates  Morgan Stanley bought two jet-fuel cargoes in Singapore,
according to the Bloomberg survey. Hin Leong and BP each sold
100,000 barrels at 10 cents a barrel over benchmark quotes, the
smallest premium in a week. The cargoes are for Nov. 4 to Nov.
8, the earliest loading period.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or diesel, fell 5 cents to
$2.80 a barrel at 3:21 p.m. Singapore time, based on data from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based broker. This regrade is
the narrowest so far this week, signaling it is less profitable
to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude rose 42 cents
to $16.71 a barrel, PVM said. This crack spread is the widest
since Oct. 7.  Fuel Oil  Hin Leong bought two 20,000-ton cargoes of 380-centistoke
fuel oil in Singapore, bringing its purchases so far this month
to at least 240,000 tons, according to the Bloomberg survey. The
closely held trader paid $9 a ton over quotes for first-half
November to Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Vitol, for loading from
Nov. 15 to Nov. 19.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 43 cents to
$4.18 a barrel at 3:21 p.m. Singapore time, based on PVM data.
That’s the smallest gap in a week, indicating reduced losses for
refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke  fuel oil  to 380-centistoke
grade decreased 50 cents to $7 a ton, the lowest in a week, PVM
said. A narrowing viscosity spread shows bunker, or marine fuel,
has declined less than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
