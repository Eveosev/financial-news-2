China  plans to turn  Tibet  into an
“important global tourist destination” by opening foreign and
local direct flights and train links, the official Xinhua News
Agency  reported .  An agreement between the  China National Tourism
Administration  and Tibet’s local government aims to speed
public-facility construction and promote the region’s tourism
image, according to the Xinhua report, posted on the State
Council’s website. The report didn’t say when the accord was
signed.  Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Jiang Yu said earlier
today that Tibet-related issues are internal matters, following
a U.S. State Department’s call for China to respect the rights
of Tibetans after a ninth young Tibetan set herself on fire to
protest Chinese rule.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
