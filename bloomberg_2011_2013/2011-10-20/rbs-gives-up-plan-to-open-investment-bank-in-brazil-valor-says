Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. gave up
a plan to start an investment bank business in  Brazil , Valor
Economico reported, citing a statement from the bank.  RBS concluded it isn’t prudent to commit itself with the
necessary investment to establish a successful operation in
Brazil, the newspaper reported on its website.  Brazil’s National Monetary Council has approved RBS’s
application to open an investment bank in the South American
country in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
