Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISCTR)  AS, Turkey’s
largest listed bank by assets, was added to the “focus sell”
list of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which said the bank is exposed
to “increasing macro headwinds” that are likely to “weigh on
price performance.”  “Asset growth will likely remain capped by lack of
abundant resources in local currency and unattractively priced
wholesale funding,” analysts including Waleed Mohsin in  London 
said in an e-mailed report today. “Macro headwinds and below-
sector returns would drive share price underperformance.”  Goldman’s 12-month price estimate for Isbank is 4.33 liras.
Isbank fell 1.1 percent to 4.55 liras at 10:04 a.m. in Istanbul.  Isbank joins  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , Turkey’s largest
bank by market value, on Goldman’s “focus sell list.” Garanti
was added on Oct. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
