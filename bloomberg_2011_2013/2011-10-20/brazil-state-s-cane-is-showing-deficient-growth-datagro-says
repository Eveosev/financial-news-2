Sugar-cane growers in Brazil’s  Sao
Paulo  state, which accounts for more than half the country’s
output, are seeing “very deficient growth” in the newly
planted crop, industry researcher Datagro Ltd. said.  “Significant failures in sprouting” of the cane crop is
evident, Datagro said today in an e-mailed report.  Brazil is the world’s biggest producer and exporter of
sugar. Latin America’s largest economy accounts for about 54
percent of global exports, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture .  To contact the reporter on this story:
