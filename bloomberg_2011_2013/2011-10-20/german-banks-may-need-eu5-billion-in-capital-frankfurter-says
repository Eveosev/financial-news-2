German banks expect a 5 billion-euro
($6.9 billion) capital shortfall in stress tests conducted by
the European Banking Authority,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The 13 banks that took part in the tests should be able to
close the gap by mid-2012 by reducing risk or retaining profits,
the newspaper said in an article on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
