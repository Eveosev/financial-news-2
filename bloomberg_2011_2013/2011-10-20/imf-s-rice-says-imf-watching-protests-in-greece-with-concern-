The  International Monetary Fund  is
concerned about demonstrations in  Greece  as protesters clashed
with police in Athens, an IMF spokesman said.  “We’re watching it closely,” Gerry Rice, the Fund’s
acting director for external relations, told reporters in
 Washington  today. “And with concern. We understand that this is
a very difficult time for the people of Greece, and times of
crisis are always difficult, especially if people perceive that
changes that need to be made are unfair.”  Tear gas was fired in central Athens as protesters clashed
with police for a second day outside the parliament building
where lawmakers debated an austerity bill, the second in four
months. Prime Minister  George Papandreou  convened a meeting of
his Cabinet as he prepared to test his party’s unity with a
final vote on the legislation later today.  Rice said the IMF is working “very closely” with the
European Commission and  European Central Bank  on Greece and
there is “no divergence” among the three.  Greece’s debt ratio, which exceeded 140 percent of gross
domestic product at the end of 2010, will remain “at very high
levels for many years,” leaving it “vulnerable to adverse
shocks,” according to a draft report by the IMF, EC and ECB, a
group known as the troika.  “Greek debt dynamics remain extremely worrying,” the
troika said. “If fiscal consolidation and privatization targets
are respected, and growth responds to structural reforms, the
debt ratio may start declining from 2013 onwards.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
