Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , the Austrian
lender that warned it would lose up to 800 million euros this
year, drew criticism from the country’s corporate governance
head, Vienna’s WirtschaftsBlatt reported.  The criticism from  Austria ’s Corporate Governance Working
Group stems from statements made by Erste Chief Executive
Officer Andreas Treichl 10 days before the Oct. 10 warning, the
newspaper said. The CEO said Sept. 29 that the bank expected a
profit.  “The bank needs a strong case because this isn’t normal,”
said the head of the governance group, Richard Schenz, in an
interview with Wirtschaftsblatt. “The Financial Market
Authority has to look very closely why something that is first
white becomes black. The suddenness is unusual.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
