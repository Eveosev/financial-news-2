Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said support of an austerity bill in a Parliament
vote today will strengthen the country’s negotiating position at
a European Union summit on Oct. 23.  “Voting for this bill will not only ensure the payment of
a sixth loan installment but also put us in a better negotiating
position at perhaps the most critical, and we hope final,
European Union negotiation, at least on the big issue of the
debt,” Papandreou said at a Cabinet meeting today, according to
an e-mailed transcript from his Athens-based office today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
