Brazil ’s inflation rate fell in mid-
October for the first time in 14 months, cementing expectations
that the central bank will continue to cut interest rates.  Consumer prices, as measured by the IPCA-15 index, rose
7.12 percent in mid-October from a year earlier, the national
 statistics agency  said today, down from 7.33 percent the
previous month. Prices rose 0.42 percent in the month through
mid-October, less than the 0.45 percent median estimate of 45
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “This goes in line with what the central bank had been
saying, that they are going to see the annual number start to
fall to levels closer to the center of the target,” said  Newton Rosa , chief economist at SulAmerica Investimentos in  Sao Paulo .
“As long as the international economy remains weak, and
continues to be deflationary, they are going to continue to cut
interest rates.”  The central bank yesterday cut its benchmark Selic rate to
11.5 percent from 12 percent, saying this would protect Brazil
from a more “restrictive” global economy without compromising
the inflation target. Traders are betting the bank will reduce
borrowing costs an additional 1.25 percentage points by April,
according to Bloomberg estimates based on interest rate futures.  The yields on the interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2013 rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point,
to 10.51 percent at 7.45 a.m. New York time. The real
strengthened 0.5 percent to 1.7661 per  U.S. dollar .  Food and Drink  The fall in the monthly rate was mainly caused by slower
increases in food, drink and clothing prices, the statistics
agency said in its report. Food and beverage prices rose 0.52
percent, compared with 0.72 percent a month earlier, while
clothing price increases slowed to 0.38 percent from 1 percent.  Even as annual inflation starts to fall, economists still
expect Brazil to miss its target of 4.5 percent, plus or minus
two percentage points, this year for the first time since 2003,
according to an Oct. 14  central bank survey .  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini has repeatedly
pledged to slow inflation to 4.5 percent by the end of 2012.
Economists surveyed by the central bank don’t expect price
increases to slow to the midpoint of the target range until
2014.  Inflation expectations for 2012 and 2013 have jumped since
policy makers began cutting  interest rates  on Aug. 31.
Economists in the central bank’s weekly surveys now forecast
consumer prices will rise 5.61 percent next year and 4.9 percent
in 2013, up from forecasts of 5.2 percent and 4.5 percent at the
end of August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
