Citadel Capital SAE fell for the
second time this week after the chairman of the Egyptian private
equity firm said the company plans to take on more debt to
strengthen the balance sheet.  The shares of the Cairo-based company retreated 1.2 percent
to 3.44 Egyptian pounds at 12:06 p.m. in Cairo, paring its gain
this week to 6.2 percent. The benchmark EGX 30 Index declined
0.2 percent today.  Citadel plans to increase its debt by $150 million and sell
some assets to raise as much as $60 million, Chairman Ahmed
Heikal said in an interview with Bloomberg television yesterday
after the end of trading in Cairo.  The shares surged 5.5 percent yesterday after Citadel said
it met its target of raising 1.05 billion pounds ($176 million)
through a rights offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
