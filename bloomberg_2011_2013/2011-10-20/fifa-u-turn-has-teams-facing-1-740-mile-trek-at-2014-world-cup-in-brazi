FIFA backtracked on plans to limit
distances teams and fans travel during the 2014 soccer  World Cup 
in  Brazil  after unveiling a schedule that may leave some moving
as much as 2,800 kilometers (1,740 miles) between games.  FIFA General Secretary  Jerome Valcke  said teams will play
in any of the 12 cities after the governing body earlier
indicated opening-round matches would be staged in four regional
clusters to limit travel in the world’s fifth-largest country.  “The host cities will have all the teams, and you can have
the best teams, the seeded teams, in all the cities,” Valcke
said at a press conference yesterday in Zurich.  The opening match on June 12, 2014 in Sao Paulo will
feature record five-time champion Brazil, with the final
scheduled for the Maracana Stadium in  Rio de Janeiro  on July 13.  FIFA  has spent 14 months devising the list of  64 matches .
The schedule was rewritten 57 times and required input from
physicians, who were asked to study the impact on players of
moving between different climates. Temperatures can fall to
around 5 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit) in the southern
city of  Porto Alegre  and hit 40 degrees Celsius in Manaus, the
capital of the Amazonian region.  Group-stage matches will begin at 1 p.m., 4 p.m, 7 p.m. and
10 p.m. local time. Round of 16 and quarterfinal matches will
start at 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., with both semifinals kicking off at
5 p.m. The final at the Maracana will start at 4 p.m.  Most Traveled  The tournament field will be split into eight groups of
four teams, with the No. 2 seed in Group A having to travel the
most. After playing the opener in  Sao Paulo , its second match is
2,700 kilometers away in Manaus and its third in Recife, a
three-and-a-half hour flight covering 2,800 kilometers.  Last year, Valcke said FIFA would consider splitting Brazil
into four regions rather than having teams travel around the
entire country.  “Brazil is a continent not just a country, so we may
divide it into four pieces, to make sure that fans do not have
to travel more than one or two hours from one stadium to the
other,” he said at the time.  Ricardo Trade, head of operations for the 2014 World Cup,
yesterday defended the decision to move teams cross country.  “The climate is so different you do not want to give an
advantage to one country over another,” he said in Zurich.  To contact the reporter on this story:
