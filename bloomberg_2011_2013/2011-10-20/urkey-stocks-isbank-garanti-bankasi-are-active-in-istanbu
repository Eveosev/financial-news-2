Turkey ’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  slumped to its lowest in five weeks, losing 3.3 percent to
55,904.51 at the close in Istanbul. Of 100 shares on the index,
85 fell, 10 rose and five were unchanged.  The following stocks were active.  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  , the Turkish lender part-owned by
Citigroup Inc., fell 5.5 percent to 6.48 liras, the lowest since
Sept. 6.  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB)  , a state-run bank,
dropped the most since Aug. 10, slumping 7 percent to 11.35
liras.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN)  , the biggest listed
bank by market value, slid 6 percent to 6.28 liras.  Turkey’s banking index dropped 5.6 percent, the most in a
month, after policy makers raised the overnight lending rate and
dropped language that suggested it may further ease monetary
policy.  Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR)  AS, Turkey’s biggest listed
lender by assets, fell for a second day, losing 6.1 percent to
4.32 liras. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. added the bank to its
“focus sell” list for the region, saying it’s exposed to
“increasing macro headwinds” that are likely to “weigh on
price performance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
