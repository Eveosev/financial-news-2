The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission unanimously approved a rule that may increase
payments from electric-grid operators to companies that help
to keep  energy supply  and demand in balance on the grid.  “This is a very important rule” that may increase the
efficiency of the grid, FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff said today
at the commission’s monthly public meeting in Washington.  The rule, which will increase payments to energy-storage
providers, may benefit companies including  Beacon Power Corp. (BCON) ,
which makes flywheels to store power.  Beacon Power rose as much as 14 percent to 44 cents in New
York trading after the agency’s action.  To contact the reporter on this story:
