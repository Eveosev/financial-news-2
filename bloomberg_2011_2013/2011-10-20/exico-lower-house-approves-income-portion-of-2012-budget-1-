Mexico ’s lower house of congress
passed the income portion of the 2012 budget, approving a wider
deficit than President Felipe Calderon originally proposed.  In a 328-68 vote and 9 abstentions, lawmakers passed the
2012 budget with a deficit equal to 0.4 percent of gross
domestic product while maintaining an estimated oil price of
$84.9 a barrel.  Calderon had proposed a budget deficit of 36.7 billion
pesos, or 0.2 percent of the country’s GDP, excluding
investments in state oil company  Petroleos Mexicanos .  The bill, which will now go to the Senate, would decrease
the official forecast for economic growth to 3.3 percent from
3.5 percent and change the forecast for the peso’s exchange rate
to 12.8 per  U.S. dollar  from 12.2.  The initiative also raises Mexico’s estimated oil
production to 2.56 million barrels a day from a previous
estimate of 2.55 million barrels a day.  The legislation postpones the cancellation of a federal tax
on gasoline sales, a portion of which is channeled to state
governments.  The changes approved by the lower house would give the
government more than 80 billion pesos ($5.84 billion) of
additional revenue next year, which would go toward education
and farming programs, Sebastian Lerdo, a lawmaker from the
 Institutional Revolutionary Party , said yesterday in statements
to reporters in Mexico City.  Calderon on Sept. 8 proposed total spending of 3.62
trillion pesos for next year, an increase of 2.5 percent in real
terms from 2011.  The Senate must approve the income portion of the budget by
Oct. 31 and the lower house must pass the spending portion by
Nov. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
