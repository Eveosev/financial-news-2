The German government cut its
economic growth forecast for next year to 1 percent, saying
uncertainties related to the debt crises in many countries have
increased.  “The pace of global economic growth has noticeably cooled
in step with increasing uncertainty because of the debt crises
in many countries,” the ministry said in a report. “The reason
for the somewhat more subdued growth path is that risks from the
international environment have increased.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
