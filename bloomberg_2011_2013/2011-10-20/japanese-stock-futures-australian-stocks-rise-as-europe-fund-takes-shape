Japanese stock futures and
Australian stocks advanced as European governments considered
deploying $1.3 trillion to fight the region’s debt crisis,
boosting the earnings outlook for Asian exporters.  American depositary receipts of Sony Corp.,  Japan ’s biggest
consumer electronics exporter, rose 0.7 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Those of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-biggest lender by market value, rose 0.2

percent in Wellington.  “It looks like Europe is gradually getting its act
together on a rescue plan for the debt crisis,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc.
“Still, investors are going to keep sitting on the fence and
trading is going to be light.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. In  New York , the index rose 0.5 percent yesterday.
Stock rose on a report that  Europe  may combine temporary and
permanent rescue funds to unleash as much as 940 billion euros
($1.3 trillion) to fight the crisis, according to two people
familiar with the matter  Better-than-expected earnings at Microsoft Corp. and a
report showing that manufacturing in the Philadelphia area
unexpectedly expanded also lifted stocks.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 16 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 3.4 percent loss by the S&P
500 and a 16 percent drop by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
