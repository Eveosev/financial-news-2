U.S. stocks were little changed
while European shares and the euro fell as investors watched
developments in talks to boost the euro-region’s bailout fund.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.1 percent at 9:34
a.m. in  New York . The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index dropped 0.7
percent. The euro lost 0.1 percent to $1.3749 after climbing as
much as 0.6 percent earlier.  European stocks extended losses and the euro reversed gains
as Die Welt reported that the German government hasn’t ruled out
postponing the debt-crisis summit scheduled for Oct. 23 in
Brussels due to stalling negotiations. Die Welt cited
unidentified people close to the ruling coalition. U.S. futures
and the euro rallied earlier, and European shares pared losses,
as draft guidelines for changes to the euro-region bailout fund
showed that credit lines for some of the most-indebted nations
may be boosted.  “ Germany  is the key to Europe’s success or not,”  Richard
Sichel , who oversees $1.6 billion as chief investment officer at
Philadelphia Trust Co., said in a telephone interview. “We
don’t know what a delay of the talks could mean. The whole hope
is to see how they are going to tackle their crisis so that
uncertainty is removed.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
