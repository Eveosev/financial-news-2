Federal Reserve Bank of  Minneapolis 
President Narayana Kocherlakota said effective central bank
policy requires “clear communication” with the public.  “The Federal Open Market Committee, under the leadership
of Chairman Ben Bernanke, has made communication a top goal,”
Kocherlakota said today in a speech in Minneapolis. “I am on
record as strongly supporting this initiative.”  Fed officials are considering ways to give more information
about the central bank’s long-run economic goals and the
circumstances under which  interest rates  will remain close to
zero, minutes of their September meeting showed. Kocherlakota,
who has dissented from each of the past two FOMC decisions, did
not comment on the outlook for monetary policy or the economy in
his prepared remarks.  “Effective policy implementation requires public support
and, therefore, public understanding,” Kocherlakota, 48, said
in the text of his speech to the Minnesota Council on Economic
Education. “Public understanding of policy decisions, in turn,
requires clear communication between policy makers and the
public.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
