U.S. stock futures climbed,
indicating the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will pare yesterday’s
decline.  EBay Inc. dropped 3.9 percent in German trading after the
largest online marketplace forecast sales and profit that missed
some analysts’ estimates. American Express Co. may be active
after reporting better-than-estimated results.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December rose 0.5 percent to 1,212.4 at 5:33 a.m. in  New York 
after the benchmark measure lost 1.3 percent yesterday. Dow
Jones Industrial Average futures expiring the same month climbed
52 points, or 0.5 percent, to 11,496.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
