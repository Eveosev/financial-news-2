Swiss exports rebounded in September
from a slump in the previous month amid signs the francâ€™s
strength is curbing economic growth.  Exports, adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, jumped
3.4 percent from August, when they fell a revised 6.9 percent,
the Federal Customs Office in Bern said in an e-mailed statement
today. Imports rose 1.3 percent from August, when they slipped a
revised 0.3 percent, and the  trade surplus  widened to 1.85
billion francs ($2 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
