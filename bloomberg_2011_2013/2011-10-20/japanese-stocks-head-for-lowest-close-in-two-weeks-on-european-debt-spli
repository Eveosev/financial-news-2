Japanese stocks fell, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average closing at its lowest level in two
weeks, as an impasse over European bailout talks sparked
concerns the global economic recovery may weaken.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co., which counts Europe as its biggest
market, fell 2.3 percent.  Advantest Corp. (6857) , a maker of memory
chip testers, declined 2.4 percent after a report showed
industry orders fell.  Olympus Corp. (7733)  extended its slump to a
fifth straight day after a shareholder urged investigation of
acquisitions in 2008 by the maker of endoscopes and cameras.  The Nikkei 225 slid 1 percent to 8,682.15, the lowest since
Oct. 7, at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index
fell 0.7 percent to 746.02, with about three stocks falling for
each that rose. The gauge tumbled 15 percent this year amid
concern the U.S. may fall into recession and that  Europe ’s debt
crisis will spread to the banking system.  “We remain pretty nervous about Europe’s crisis because we
have yet to see a concrete safety-net being established for the
financial system,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about
$600 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.
“Pessimism about Europe sets the tone for the market’s
sentiment.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.5 percent
today. In  New York , the index declined 1.3 percent yesterday as
France and Germany split on the role of the  European Central
Bank  in leveraging a rescue fund, while banks lobbied against
forced recapitalizations and larger writedowns of Greek debt.  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  flew to  Germany  to join
the talks as leaders assembled in  Frankfurt  in an effort to
narrow divisions before an Oct. 23 summit.  More Pessimistic  While German Chancellor Angela Merkel this week sought to
lower expectations that the crisis effort would climax at the
summit in Brussels, Group of 20 finance chiefs last week set the
meeting as a deadline for action. Failure risks a global
economic slump, they said.  U.S. companies grew more pessimistic about the strength of
a recovery even as the world’s biggest economy continued to
expand last month, according to the  Federal Reserve ’s Beige Book
survey released yesterday.  Exporters Slump  Exporters dropped. Nippon Sheet Glass slid 2.3 percent to
167 yen. Nissan Motor Co., a carmaker that gets about 15 percent
of its sales in Europe, fell 1.7 percent to 697 yen. Toyota
Motor Corp., the world’s largest automaker by market value, lost
1 percent to 2,555 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s biggest exporter of
consumer electronics, declined 1.6 percent to 1,544 yen.  Makers of semiconductor equipment fell after a report
showed orders declined 38 percent from a year earlier in
September to 79.5 billion yen ($1 billion). Advantest slipped
2.4 percent to 857 yen. Dainippon Screen Manufacturing Co.,
Japan’s second-biggest supplier of chipmaking equipment by sales,
dropped 2.6 percent to 553 yen.  Tokyo Electron Ltd. (8035) , the world’s
No. 2 maker of semiconductor gear, slid 2.3 percent to 3,885 yen.  Olympus dropped 4.9 percent to 1,321 yen, extending its
slump to a fifth day after Harris Associate LP, the seventh-
largest shareholder, called for an independent investigation of
acquisitions made in 2008. Harris sent a letter to the company’s
board and the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange, said David Herro, chief
investment officer of the U.S.-based investment firm.  ‘Serious Issues’  “There are serious issues surrounding the massive
destruction of stakeholder value and there needs to be
accountability,” Herro said in an e-mail. “I stress
stakeholders because the damage is not just to the shareholders,
but the employees, suppliers and customers whom also deserve
answers.”  The Tokyo-based company lost almost $4 billion of market
value in the past four trading days after Michael C. Woodford
was fired as president and a PricewaterhouseCoopers report that
he commissioned said the company may face regulatory and legal
scrutiny because of payments made to advisers in the acquisition
of Gyrus Group Plc in 2008.  Showa Denko KK (4004) , a chemicals producer, led declines among
Japanese companies affected by Thailand’s worst floods in 50
years. Showa Denko slumped 5.4 percent to 139 yen.  TDK Corp. (6762) , an
electronics manufacturer which shut at least four factories in
the Asian country, sank 3.8 percent to 2,713 yen.  Kubota Corp. (6326) ,
Asia’s biggest maker of  farm equipment  by sales, lost 2 percent
to 604 yen after saying yesterday it closed three Thai plants.  Materials Makers  Raw materials producers dropped after industrial metals and
crude oil futures extended losses. Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.,
Japan’s second-largest copper smelter, sank 3.4 percent to 1,022
yen. Mitsui & Co., which gets about 40 percent of its revenue
from commodities, lost 0.7 percent to 1,093 yen. Inpex Corp.,
the nation’s biggest energy explorer, slid 1.4 percent to
504,000 yen.  Among stocks that rose, Tokyo Electric Power Co., the
utility in the middle of the worst nuclear disaster in 25 years,
surged 36 percent to 292 yen. The shares have fallen 86 percent
since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami caused meltdowns at
the utility’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant.  To contact the reporters on this story:
