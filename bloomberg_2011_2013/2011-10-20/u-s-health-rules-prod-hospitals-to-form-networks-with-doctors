Hospital chains such as  Community
Health Systems Inc. (CYH)  will get a shot at bigger financial rewards

under regulations released by the Obama administration.  The  U.S. Department of Health  and Human Services issued
streamlined rules today for so-called accountable care

next three years. Savings would be shared between providers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
