Greek Finance Minister Evangelos
Venizelos said the International Monetary Fund’s decision to pay
its part of the sixth loan to  Greece  depends both on an

prospect of future financing for the country for the next 12
months. He spoke in Parliament in  Athens  today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
