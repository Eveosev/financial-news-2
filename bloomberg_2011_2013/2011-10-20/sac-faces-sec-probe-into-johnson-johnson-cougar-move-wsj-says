SAC Capital Investors LLP is being
investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to
see if it profited from inside information on  Johnson &
Johnson (JNJ) ’s takeover of Cougar Biotechnology Inc., the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  In 2008 SAC held 7,800 Cougar shares but by March 2009 the
hedge fund had accumulated 632,291 shares; Johnson & Johnson
announced its Cougar takeover on May 21, the newspaper said.  SAC is facing a criminal probe by federal prosecutors in
New York into trades made by an account overseen by SAC’s
founder, Steven Cohen; the U.S. regulator is also checking
Leerink Swann LLP, a Boston investment bank that runs a so-
called expert network, the WSJ said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
