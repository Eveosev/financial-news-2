Zimbabwe  will reopen a contract for
an aerial assessment of the geology of the Marange diamond
fields by the end of the year, Deputy Mines Minister Gift Chimanikire said.  The tender was suspended last year because of
“administrative problems,” Chimanikire said today in an
interview in the capital, Harare.  The Marange diamond fields are in the east of Zimbabwe,
about 90 kilometers (56 miles) south-west Mutare.  Human Rights
Watch  has accused Zimbabwean authorities of killing local
villagers and illegal miners at the site. In 2008, more than 200
people were killed when security forces seized the Marange
fields, according to the New York-based group. Zimbabwe’s
government has rejected the accusations.  Anjin Investments Ltd., a Chinese company, is the top
producer of diamonds in Zimbabwe, Chimanikire said.  Anjin, a unit of  China ’s state-owned Anhui Foreign Economic
Construction Group Ltd., produces about 234,750 carats of
diamonds a month from the Marange field, Chimanikire said. Mbada
Mining Ltd. produces about 164,490 carats a month, followed by
Marange Mineral Resources Ltd. with about 104,710 carats, he
said. A carat is a fifth of a gram.  To contact the reporter on this story:
