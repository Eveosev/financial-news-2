Ethanol futures sank to the lowest
price in more than a week as production rose to the highest
level in two months.  Futures fell a third day a day after the Energy Department
reported production of ethanol swelled to 908,000 barrels a day
last week, the highest level since Aug. 5 and supply climbed to
17.1 million barrels, rebounding from the lowest amount since
December.  “It’s been so strong, really for the last month and a
half, so maybe it’s taking a little bit of a breather here,”
said Will Babler, a broker at First Capitol Risk Management in
Galena,  Illinois . “Everyone’s, seasonally, trying to get back
up to full production or are at full production.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery fell 5 cents, or
1.9 percent, to $2.632 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the biggest decline since Sept. 30 and the lowest price since
Oct. 12. Futures have gained 11 percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.70 a gallon and in  New York  the additive increased
0.5 cent to $2.855, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast added 1.5 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $2.98 a gallon and in Chicago the alternative fuel decreased
1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.74.  To contact the reporter on this story:
