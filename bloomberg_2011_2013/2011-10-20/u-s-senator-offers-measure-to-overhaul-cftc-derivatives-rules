The  U.S. Senate  may vote on a
measure to overhaul the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act’s
derivatives regulations, giving the chamber’s Republicans a rare
opportunity to strike at a law the majority of them opposed.  Senator  Mike Crapo , an Idaho Republican, offered the
measure as an amendment yesterday that would restrict funding
for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s implementation of
the law until the agency provides quantitative analyses and
assessments of the impact of the new rules on the economy, the
$601 trillion derivatives market and its liquidity, as well as
an analysis of the international harmonization efforts.  “I focus on the CFTC to send a strong message to all
regulators involved in the rulemaking process that we cannot
afford regulations that unnecessarily burden our businesses, our
economy, and our competitive position in the global
marketplace,” Crapo, a senior member of the Banking Committee,
said yesterday on the Senate floor.  Crapo’s measure would require the agency to limit its
regulatory reach into foreign subsidiaries -- an issue that has
drawn bipartisan support on  Capitol Hill . The amendment also
aims to restrict the agency’s ability to require corporate end-
users to post margin on swaps trades.  Crapo’s measure is a pending amendment to a spending bill
on the Senate floor. A vote on the amendment hasn’t been
scheduled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
