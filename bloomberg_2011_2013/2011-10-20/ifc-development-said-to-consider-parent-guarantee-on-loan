Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16) ,
 Henderson Land  Development Co. and  Hong Kong  & China Gas Co.,
who jointly own IFC Development Ltd., may guarantee the unit’s
HK$5 billion ($643 million) loan, according to a person familiar
with the matter.  IFC Development is seeking the loan to partly refinance a
HK$17.4 billion facility signed in 2007 and maturing in March
2012, the person said, declining to be identified because the
details are private. The loan amount was reduced to HK$5
billion, from HK$17 billion the developer sought earlier this
year, as market conditions deteriorated, a second person
familiar with the matter said today.  A guarantee from the companies which own IFC would make the
facility more attractive to lenders that are facing rising
funding costs, the second person said.  Some terms of the deal including final size and the
potential guarantee are still under negotiation, both people,
who have direct knowledge of the transaction, said.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Mizuho Financial Group
Inc., Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc. and United Overseas Bank Ltd. will likely lend at
least HK$1 billion each, another person familiar with the matter
said on Oct. 18.  The new loan pays an all-in rate, which includes margin and
fees, of about 150 basis points more than the London interbank
offered rate, the person said at the time.  Henderson Land and Sun Hung Kai Properties corporate
communications officials didn’t respond to e-mails seeking
comment on the loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
