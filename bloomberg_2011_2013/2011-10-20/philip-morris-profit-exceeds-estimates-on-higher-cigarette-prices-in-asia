Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) ,
the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company, reported
third-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates, helped by
higher shipments and increased cigarette prices in Asia.  Net income rose 30 percent to $2.38 billion, or $1.35 a
share, from $1.82 billion, or 99 cents, a year earlier, the New
York-based maker of Marlboro cigarettes said in a statement.
Excluding some items, profit was $1.37 a share, beating the
$1.24 average of 14 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Louis Camilleri raised prices in
Japan, Australia and Indonesia, where demand pushed total
shipments higher by 4.4 percent. Excluding excise taxes, total
sales at  Philip Morris , which generates all of its revenue
outside the U.S., advanced 26 percent to $8.36 billion.  “Aided by  Asia  and the emerging markets, shipments were
good, and they’re not having any problem getting price
increases,” Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. in St.
Louis, said today in an interview. He rates the shares as
“buy.” “They blew by the consensus pretty easily.”  The company raised the low end of its 2011 profit forecast
by 5 cents to $4.75 a share, and left unchanged the high end of
$4.80. Analysts projected $4.74, the average of 16 estimates.  Philip Morris rose 3.3 percent to $68.19 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The shares have climbed 17 percent this year.  Most Profitable  Lorillard Inc. (LO) , the third-largest U.S. cigarette maker, is
scheduled to release its results on Oct. 24, followed by
 Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) , the second-biggest, on Oct. 25 and
 Altria Group Inc. (MO) , the largest, on Oct. 27.  Philip Morris is the second most profitable company in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, after  Linear Technology Corp. (LLTC) ,
according to earnings rankings compiled by Bloomberg through
Oct. 18. The analysis gave equal weight to five variables,
including profit margin and return on invested capital.
Lorillard, based in Greensboro, North Carolina, ranked 10th.  To contact the reporter on this story:
