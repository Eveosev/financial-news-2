Zijin Mining Group Co.,  China ’s
biggest gold producer by market value, fell the most in more
than two weeks in Hong Kong trading as bullion prices dropped.  The shares declined as much as 9.5 percent to HK$2.76, the
most since Oct. 4, and were at HK$2.83 at 2:06 p.m. local time,
down 7.2 percent. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  fell 2.7 percent.  Gold has slumped 16 percent since rising to a record
$1,921.15 an ounce on Sept. 6 as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis
and falling global equities spurred demand for the metal.
Bullion for immediate delivery fell 1.5 percent to $1,616.98 an
ounce at 1:15 p.m. Hong Kong time.  “Gold’s rally this year has really been over the euro-zone
crisis, and a lot of money has left the euro,” Cameron Peacock,
a market analyst with IG Markets Ltd. in  Melbourne , said by
telephone. “During the last two days we’ve seen some strength
in the dollar, which has weighed on gold.”  Zijin said yesterday it plans to borrow bullion from banks
to sell in the market as the company is betting prices will rise.
The company also sold bonds convertible into shares of Glencore
International Plc, the world’s largest publicly traded
commodities supplier, according to three people familiar with
the matter yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
