President  Barack Obama  told  Norway ’s
Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg that the strength of the NATO
alliance made the mission against Muammar Qaddafi’s regime in
 Libya  successful.  The U.S. president said he appreciates NATO-member Norway
“helping to give Libya an opportunity to become a democracy.”  Asked whether Qaddafi’s death today vindicated U.S.
strategy, Obama said, “We did exactly what we said we were
going to do.” Qaddafi died after being captured in his hometown
of Sirte, ending a search for the deposed leader that began when
he fled Tripoli in August.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization “accomplished our
aim in Libya,” Stoltenberg said.  Obama and Stoltenberg met in the Oval Office today with an
agenda that also included the debt crisis in  Europe , the war in
Afghanistan, the battle against terrorism and the stalled Middle
East peace process.  The two leaders also discussed the “heartbreaking” mass
shooting in Stoltenberg’s country, Obama said. The tragedy
underscores the need for cooperation in combating extremism, he
said.  Norway was rocked by a July 22 shooting rampage by Anders Behring Breivik at a Labor Party youth camp on Utoeya Island
that killed 69, including some as young as 14, and a car bomb in
Oslo’s government district that took eight lives.  To contact the reporters on this story:
