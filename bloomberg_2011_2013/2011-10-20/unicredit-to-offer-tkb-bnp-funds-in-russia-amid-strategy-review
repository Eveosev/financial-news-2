UniCredit SpA (UCG)  will distribute mutual
funds from  Russia ’s TKB BNP Investment Partners, two months
after the Italian bank said it was reviewing the future of its
own Russian funds unit.  UniCredit, eastern  Europe ’s biggest bank, will start
offering TKB BNP’s 18 mutual funds in its Russian branches this
month, the Russian  fund manager  said in an e-mailed statement
today. UniCredit will be “actively cooperating” with both its
own Pioneer Global Asset Management and TKB BNP, according to an
e-mailed statement from the Italian lender’s Russian office.  UniCredit said on Aug. 22 that it was “reviewing strategic
options” for Pioneer Global, which was set up in March 2007 to
sell mutual funds in Russia. Elena Loginova, the chief executive
officer of Pioneer in Moscow from its inception, left the firm
in June to rejoin Deutsche Bank AG.  TKB BNP is owned jointly by Russian Railways and France’s
 BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, and says it manages about $4.3 billion for
domestic and international investors.  UniCredit plans to combine its Russian brokerage, formerly
known as Aton, and UniCredit Bank Russia, previously called
International Moscow Bank, two people with knowledge of the
matter said in August. It wrote down the broker’s remaining
goodwill in the second quarter after profit for the first half
of 2011 was “about zero,” according to Francesco Giordano,
chief financial officer of Bank Austria, UniCredit’s eastern
European arm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
