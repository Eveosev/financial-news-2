The number of short positions in the
U.S. stock market is “so high that, if we get some good news,
we  could get a stock melt-up,” said  Michael Holland , chairman
and founder of Holland and Co.  “For traders it’s a treacherous environment,” Holland
said this morning in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance’ with Ken Prewitt and  Carol Massar .  Traders are anticipating ‘‘clogged arteries’’ from European
policy makers as they meet this weekend to try to resolve the
region’s debt crisis. ‘‘Surprise good news would force investors
to buy securities to close out all those shorts,’’ Holland said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
