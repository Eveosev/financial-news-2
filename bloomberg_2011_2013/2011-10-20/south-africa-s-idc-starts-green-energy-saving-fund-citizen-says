South Africa ’s Industrial
Development Corp. started a 500 million-rand ($62 million) fund
to support energy-saving at small and medium sized businesses,
the Citizen reported, citing the state-owned lender’s Green
Industries head Rentia van Tonder.  The fund, which is supported by the German development bank
KfW, will provide loans at 2 percent less than the prime lending
rate for energy saving investments, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
