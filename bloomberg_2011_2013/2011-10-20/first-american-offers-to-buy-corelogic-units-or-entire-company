(Corrects first paragraph to show that CoreLogic was spun
off from First American Financial.)  First American Financial Corp. (FAF) , the
title insurer that spun off CoreLogic Inc. last year, urged the
provider of mortgage data not to sell itself and instead
consider divesting units.  First American, which holds the largest stake in CoreLogic,
has offered to buy units or the entire company if it proceeds
with a sale, the  Santa Ana , California-based insurer said today
in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
