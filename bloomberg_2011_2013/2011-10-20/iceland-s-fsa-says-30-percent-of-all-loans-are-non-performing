More than 30 percent of all
Icelandic corporate and household loans are non-performing,
according to a statement from the island’s  Financials
Supervisory Authority .  It will take the Icelandic financial market about three to
five years to work its way out of difficulties following the
economic collapse in 2008, the financial watchdog said. It
estimates that non-performing loans amount to 15 percent of the
island’s lenders’ book value, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
