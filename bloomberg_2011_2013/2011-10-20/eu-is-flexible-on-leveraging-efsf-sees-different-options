The European Commission said it’s
“flexible” on how the European Financial Stability Facility is
leveraged, saying there are different options available.  “Theoretically, there are different options to leverage
the EFSF,” commission economics spokesman  Amadeu Altafaj  told
reporters in Brussels today. “What counts now is the political
will and the discussions have to take place.”  “What the commission wants to achieve is clear, on the
means we are flexibile, but they have to be acceptable to all
stakeholders of the EFSF,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
