Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won the backing of a majority of lawmakers in a
second test of support for a new austerity package.  Papandreou secured the support of at least 151 lawmakers in
the 300-seat chamber, an initial tally of votes in parliament in
Athens today showed. The result, if confirmed, would be enough
for him to pass the bill. The roll-call vote on each article of
the bill is ongoing.  The ballot sets the stage for additional pension and wage
cuts that would bolster the governmentâ€™s chances of meeting 2011
and 2012 budget targets and securing further international
financial aid for  Greece .  It is being televised live on state-run Vouli TV.   To contact the reporter on this story:
