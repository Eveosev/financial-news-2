The European Medicines Agency said
it agreed to a precautionary recall of some batches of  Astellas
Pharma Inc. (4503) ’s Advagraf after detection of more active substance
than expected being released from the capsules.  The batches of 0.5-milligram capsules will be recalled from
pharmacies and wholesalers across the European Union, the agency
said today in a statement on its website. There is nothing to
suggest that the defect in the capsules is linked to adverse
effects in patients, the EMA said.  Advagraf is used to prevent  organ rejection  in adults who
have had a kidney or liver transplant, the agency said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
