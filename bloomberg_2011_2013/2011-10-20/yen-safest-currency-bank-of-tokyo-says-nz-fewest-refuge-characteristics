The yen is a better bet than the
dollar or Swiss franc in times of market turmoil, according to
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.  The yen topped the bank’s haven list, followed by the
franc, the  U.S. dollar  and the Canadian dollar. New Zealand’s
currency had the fewest refuge characteristics, the bank said.  “Historically, the yen has the strongest positive
correlation with rising risk aversion, while the Japanese
economy is surprisingly closed, leaving it less exposed to
swings in external demand,” said  Lee Hardman , a strategist in
 London  at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in a note to clients
today. “Japan has the third largest asset market after the U.S.
and euro-zone, with ample liquidity, an attractive proposition
during periods of heightened financial market instability.”  The Tokyo-based bank ranked the currencies of the Group-of-
10 nations on the liquidity of the domestic financial market,
the quality of its domestic government balance, domestic
economic and political stability and the domestic economy’s and
currency’s resilience to external shocks, according to the
report.  The yen can gain support as Japanese investors repatriate
funds and from the nation’s international investment surplus
equaling about 55 percent of gross domestic product.  The yen fell 0.1 percent today to 76.89 per dollar and
gained 0.1 percent to 105.57 per euro in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
