Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev ’s
special envoy warned of persistent conflict in Libya even if the
news of Muammar Qaddafi’s death is confirmed, RIA Novosti
reported.  “A guerrilla war against the National Transitional Council
is possible even without the involvement of the colonel, and
NATO can’t continue bombing endlessly,” the state news service
cited  Mikhail Margelov  as saying.  Before Qaddafi’s overthrow, Margelov led talks with rebel
Libyan authorities who now hold power in the North African
country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
