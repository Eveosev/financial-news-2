Canadian natural gas fell as ample
supplies and higher U.S. production offset increased furnace use
brought on by lower-than-normal temperatures, reducing demand
for the nation’s gas exports.  Alberta  gas fell 1.9 percent after the Energy Department
reported U.S. stockpiles rose 103 billion cubic feet last week,
above the five-year average gain of 58 billion. The number of
rigs drilling for gas in the U.S. was 936 as of Oct. 14, the
most this year, according to data compiled by Baker Hughes Inc.  “The rig count and production are high and there is no
real weather demand yet,” said Carl Neill, an energy consultant
with Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta. “There’s just no
underlying strength in the market.”  Alberta gas for November delivery fell 6 cents to C$3.14
per gigajoule ($2.95 per million British thermal units) as of
10:45 a.m. New York time, according to  NGX , a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and is priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta
system.  Gas for November delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 2.2 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $3.608 per million
Btu as of 10:53 a.m.  Gas Flows  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.2 billion cubic
feet, 374 million below the target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.69 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.85 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.34 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.42 billion cubic feet today, about 51
percent of its capacity of 2.76 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.98
billion cubic feet at 9:35 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
