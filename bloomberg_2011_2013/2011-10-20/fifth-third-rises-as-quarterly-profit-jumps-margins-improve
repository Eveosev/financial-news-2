Fifth Third Bancorp. (FITB) ,  Ohio ’s biggest
lender, climbed the most in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials
Index after quarterly net income more than doubled and the
profitability of loans improved.  The stock jumped 9.1 percent, the biggest gain in the 81-
company S&P index, to $11.63 at the close of trading in New
York. The index gained 1.8 percent.  Net income surged to $373 million, or 40 cents a share,
from $175 million, or 22 cents, in the same period a year
earlier, the company said today in a statement. The average per-
share profit estimate of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
33 cents. The net interest margin, the difference between what a
bank pays in deposits and charges for loans, rose to 3.65
percent from 3.62 percent in the second quarter.  “They had a bigger benefit from their funding costs going
down than many other banks,” Kenneth Usdin, a senior analyst
for Jefferies & Co. in  New York , said by phone.  Provisions for souring loans fell 81 percent to $87
million, and charge-offs for bad debts fell to the lowest level
since the fourth quarter of 2007, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
