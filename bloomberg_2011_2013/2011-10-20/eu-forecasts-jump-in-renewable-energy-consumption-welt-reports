The European Union forecasts that
renewable energy will account for 55 percent of consumption in
the region by 2050, compared with 10 percent today,  Die Welt 
reported, citing a draft European Commission document.  Nuclear energy will be one of the most important energy
sources to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reach the
European Unionâ€™s climate targets, according to the document,
Welt said. Its share of energy production in  Europe  will be
almost unchanged from today by 2050, at 18 percent, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
