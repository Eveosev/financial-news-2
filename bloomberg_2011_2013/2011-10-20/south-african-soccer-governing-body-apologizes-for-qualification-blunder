The South African Football
Association apologized that its national soccer team failed to
qualify for next year’s African Cup of Nations, after playing
its deciding match for a draw.  South Africa ’s Bafana Bafana celebrated their
qualification, after believing their goalless draw against
 Sierra Leone  on Oct. 1 would guarantee them a berth at the
continental championship in  Equatorial Guinea  and Gabon. They
later discovered the rules favored head-to-head records over
goal difference in the event of a deadlock, securing Niger’s
qualification instead of them.  “Events in Nelspruit, in which Bafana players celebrated,
thinking they had qualified for the finals, have left the entire
nation devastated and in mourning,” SAFA President Kirsten Nematandani said in a  statement  on the Johannesburg-based body’s
website yesterday. “The failure by members of our technical
team to acquaint themselves with some of the Confederation of
African Football rules is unacceptable.”  The mistake was a “glaring error”, he said.  South Africa has failed to qualify for the tournament the
last two times, despite being the eighth best team on the
continent, according to rankings by FIFA, the world governing
body for the sport. The team also last year became the first
World Cup host not to progress beyond the group stages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
