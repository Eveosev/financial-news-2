Bradley Horowitz, vice president and
product manager of  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Google+ service, talks about
changes and leadership at Yahoo Inc.  Horowitz previously worked at Yahoo as vice president of
advanced development. He spoke at the All Things D conference in
 Hong Kong  today.  On Yahoo’s business:  “The company is actually quite healthy. It’s not on the
ropes, it’s not as if they don’t have traffic. They have number
one sites in many categories.”  On personnel:  “What’s missing is relevance. Why would the most talented
people in the world go to Yahoo right now given the churn and
challenges they have?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
