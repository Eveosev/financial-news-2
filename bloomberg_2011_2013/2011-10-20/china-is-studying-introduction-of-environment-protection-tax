China ’s State Council is studying
the introduction of an environmental protection tax, and the
nation plans to increase environmental spending, including it in
the annual budgets of all levels of government.  The government will also support bond issues for companies
undertaking environmental projects and provide tax breaks,
according to a  statement  posted on the government’s website
yesterday after a Cabinet meeting headed by Premier  Wen Jiabao .  The world’s biggest polluter is pushing local authorities
to deal with damage to the environment caused by two decades of
expansion averaging more than 10 percent a year. Wen last month
called for increased efforts to conserve energy and reduce
emissions, describing the situation as “rather severe.”  China emits more  greenhouse gases  than any other country.
It vowed to reduce  carbon emissions  per unit of gross domestic
product by as much as 45 percent in 2020 from 2005 levels. The
government missed a target of reducing energy consumption by 20
percent between 2006 and 2010, even after shutting at least
7,000 factories and banning power-price discounts for some
industries.  The government will also provide tax breaks for some auto-
fuel businesses, and may adjust import and export tariffs on
“high polluting” products, according to the statement, dated
Oct. 17.  The Ministry of Environmental Protection said last month
China’s thermal power plants may need upgrading at a cost of 260
billion yuan ($41 billion) to meet new emissions rules.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
