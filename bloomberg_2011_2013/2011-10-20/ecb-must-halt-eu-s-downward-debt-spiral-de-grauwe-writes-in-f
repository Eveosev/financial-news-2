The  European Central Bank  must act
to stop the downward spiral that would occur with the
recapitalizing of European Union banks and the resulting
downgrades and fears of sovereign default, Paul De Grauwe writes
in the Financial Times.  The ECB should announce that it is prepared to intervene in
the market; it is the only institution capable of doing so
because it can create money without limit, the University of
Leuven, Belgium, economics professor writes.  Investors, convinced of the resolve of the ECB to
intervene, would stop selling sovereign bonds in the knowledge
that a floor had been placed on their prices, De Grauwe writes.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
