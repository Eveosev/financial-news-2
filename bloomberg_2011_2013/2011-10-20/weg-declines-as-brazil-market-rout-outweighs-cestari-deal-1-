Industrial-machinery maker  Weg SA (WEGE3) 
declined as the outlook for fewer interest-rate cuts dragged
down Brazilian equities and overshadowed an agreement to form a
joint venture with Cestari Industrial e Comercial SA.  Weg slipped 1.7 percent to 18.87 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, after gaining as much as 2.3 percent
earlier. The benchmark Bovespa index slumped 1.7 percent today
as yields on interest-rate futures rose after the central bank
lowered borrowing costs by half a point. Weg is down 13 percent
this year, compared to 22 percent for the Bovespa.  The company, in a filing yesterday after the market closed,
said it would join with Cestari to develop, produce and sell
electrical equipment known as velocity reducers. Cestari assets
included in the venture should generate 70 million reais ($39.2
million) in revenue in 2011, according to the filing.  While the deal is “positive,” it “will likely have a
limited impact on Weg’s revenue,” which is projected at 5.1
billion reais this year, according to a note to clients today
from Daniel Gewehr, an analyst at Banco Santander SA.  “This acquisition is strategically positive, as it enables
Weg to enter the power transmission business, and is in line
with the company’s growth strategy,” Gewehr wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
