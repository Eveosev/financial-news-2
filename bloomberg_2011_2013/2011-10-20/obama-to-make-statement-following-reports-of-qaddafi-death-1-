President Barack Obama will make a
statement at 2 p.m. Washington time from the White House Rose
Garden about the death of deposed Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ,
the White House announced.  The U.S. has gotten reports through diplomatic channels
that Qaddafi was killed, according to an administration
official, who wasn’t authorized to speak on the record about the
president’s remarks. While declining to say whether the U.S. has
independently confirmed Qaddafi’s death, the official said the
administration was confident in the information it’s received.  Leaders of the National Transitional Council in  Libya 
announced that Qaddafi died after being captured in his hometown
of Sirte earlier today. In Paris, French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said Qaddafi died in fighting as a convoy trying to
escape Sirte was stopped.  Qaddafi’s death comes six months after President Obama
committed U.S. assistance to a NATO-led military campaign
against Qaddafi’s forces.  To contact the reporters on this story:
