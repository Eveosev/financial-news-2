Greek Finance Minister Evangelos
Venizelos told lawmakers in  Athens  today that the government’s
austerity bill must be approved in its entirety for the
government to be able to negotiate with its European Union
partners.  If the bill and all its articles aren’t approved then
 Greece  has no reason to go to a meeting of Euro area finance
ministers tomorrow or to the EU summit on Oct. 23, Venizelos
said in statements carried live on state-run Vouli TV.  “We must tell Greeks the truth,” he said. “There are no
miracles. The country won’t be saved by some miracle. The
miracle will be the result of hard work.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
