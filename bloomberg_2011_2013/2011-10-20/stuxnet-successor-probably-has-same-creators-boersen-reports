A newly found harmful software
called Duqu, a trojan that can prepare targeted computers for
industrial sabotage, probably stems from the same creators as
the Stuxnet virus discovered last year,  Boersen-Zeitung  said,
citing Lars Kroll, a security manager at  Symantec Corp. (SYMC)   Duqu isnâ€™t capable of physical destruction as Stuxnet was,
the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
