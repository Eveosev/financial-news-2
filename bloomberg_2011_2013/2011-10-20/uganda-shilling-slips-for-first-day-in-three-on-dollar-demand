Uganda ’s shilling weakened for the
first time in three days against the dollar.  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy
depreciated 0.2 percent to 2,840 per dollar at 3:59 p.m. in
Kampala, the capital according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
closed at 2,835 yesterday.  “The market was driven by interbank buying of the dollar;
otherwise there is no appetite for the dollar from customers
because of shortage of shillings,” Taiub Lubega, a currency
trader at Stanbic Bank Uganda Ltd., said by phone from Kampala
today. The “lack of shillings is caused by tight monetary
policy by the central bank.”  Uganda’s central bank will take “appropriate” steps to
support the shilling, though it hasn’t decided on whether to
follow neighboring  Kenya  in limiting the foreign exchange
exposure of commercial banks, spokesman Elliot Mwebya said
yesterday. The shilling reached 2,897.50 against the dollar on
Sept. 23, the weakest since June 1993, as inflation increased
and as  Europe ’s debt crisis cut demand for riskier assets.  The currency has slipped almost 19 percent this year to the
dollar, making it the second-worst performer in the period after
the Kenyan shilling, which has fallen 19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
