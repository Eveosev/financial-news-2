Nucor Corp. (NUE) , the largest U.S.
steelmaker by market value, posted third-quarter earnings and
sales that beat analysts’ estimates after it shipped more metal
to customers.  Net income rose to 57 cents a share in the three months
ended Oct. 1 from 7 cents a year earlier, the Charlotte, North
Carolina-based company said in a statement today. The average of
16 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for 52 cents a
share while Nucor last month forecast 45 to 55 cents. Sales
gained 27 percent to $5.25 billion topping the $4.85 billion
average of 12 estimates.  Nucor said total shipments to external customers rose 3
percent to 5.79 million tons and operating rates at its mills
climbed to 74 percent from 68 percent.  U.S. steelmakers are recovering from the collapse in orders
from automotive and construction industries that followed the
economic crisis in 2008. They used 76 percent of their capacity
at the end of the third quarter, up from 71 percent a year
earlier, according to data from the  American Iron and Steel
Institute .  “Look at capital goods: It’s in an expansion phase in the
 United States ,”  Mark Parr , an analyst with KeyBanc Capital
Markets Inc. in  Cleveland , said in a telephone interview
yesterday. “It’s fully recovered from the recession and order
momentum is higher than it was in 2008.”  Shrinking Margins  Nucor rose 2.7 percent to $35.83 at 10:18 a.m. in  New York .  Net income advanced more than sevenfold to $181.5 million
from $23.5 million in the third quarter. Nucor said the current
quarter will be less profitable as margins for steel sheet and
plate shrink.  “End markets such as automotive, heavy equipment, energy
and general manufacturing have continued to show the most
strength compared to 2010 but have shown very little improvement
compared to the first half of 2011,” Nucor said in the
statement.  David Martin , a New York-based analyst with Deutsche Bank
AG, said for U.S. steel producers to be “operating on all
cylinders,” will require capacity utilization to increase to
the mid-80 percent range.  Growth “is not going to be coming from the end markets
that have been driving the business the last couple years,” he
said yesterday in an interview. “It’s going to have to come
from a pretty significant improvement in the  construction
industry .”  Nucor said it’s on schedule to complete construction and
start production at its direct reduced iron plant in Louisiana
in mid-2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
