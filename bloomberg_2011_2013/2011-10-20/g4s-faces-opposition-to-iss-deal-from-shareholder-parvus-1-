G4S Plc (GFS) ’s planned purchase of Danish
cleaning-services company ISS for $8.2 billion in equity and
debt is meeting resistance from Parvus Asset Management, among
its largest investor, which said the deal is too risky.  Some of the other 20 top shareholders in the security
services company are also inclined to vote against the move at a
Nov. 2 shareholders’ meeting, Parvus fund manager Edoardo Mercadante said in a phone interview.  G4S is targeting ISS to expand in cleaning services as it
seeks to bundle office-upkeep and security into a single
contract. For Parvus, there is a risk that such an integrated
services approach won’t work outside the U.K. market and
absorbing a company with about 1.2 million employees may disrupt
operations, Mercadante said. G4S dropped 22 percent on the day
of the announcement, a record.  “It is just too big a step to take on an unproven
vision,” said Mercadante. Parvus has a 3.7 percent stake in the
company, he said. “They are also taking a huge financial
risk.”  The Crawley, England-based company plans a 2 billion-pound
rights offer to fund the purchase. G4S is buying ISS from EQT
Partners and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners for a total value of
5.2 billion pounds, of which 3.7 billion pounds is assumed debt.  G4S rose 8.3 pence, or 3.6 percent, to 241.9 pence at 11:24
a.m. in London trading, giving the company a market value of
3.41 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
