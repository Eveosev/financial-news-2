Brazilian senators approved a rule
that modifies the way revenue from oil exploration is divided
among states and municipalities, reducing the amount of money
that goes to the federal government.  The  Senate  voted yesterday to reduce oil royalties received
by the federal government to 20 percent of revenue collected
from 30 percent. Oil producing states will have their revenue
reduced from 26.25 percent to 20 percent. Non-producing states
and municipalities will start getting a bigger share of taxes
charged on oil exploration.  Under the new legislation, states like Rio de Janeiro and
Espirito Santo, which have oil exploration and production units,
will get 7.43 billion reais ($4.19 billion) from oil contracts
next year, compared with 8.22 billion reais this year, according
to calculations distributed in a statement by Senator Francisco Dornelles to reporters in Brasilia yesterday.  The new rules are valid for  oil fields  that have already
been auctioned and donâ€™t alter royalties paid by companies such
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , said the leader of the government
coalition in the senate, Romero Juca.  The bill goes to a Lower House vote.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
