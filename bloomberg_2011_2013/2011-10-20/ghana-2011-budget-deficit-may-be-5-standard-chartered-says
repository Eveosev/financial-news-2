Ghana’s  budget deficit  may be about
5 percent of gross domestic product this year as a growing
economy helps contain rising debt, said Razia Khan, head of
Africa economy research at  Standard Chartered Plc. (STAN)   The government should aim for a lower budget deficit in
2012 to send a “positive signal” to investors, especially given
that the West African nation is entering a presidential and
parliamentary election year, which raises the possibility of
higher spending, she said in an interview after a giving a
speech at a conference in Accra, the capital.  “It is encouraging that the West African nation’s rising
growth is absorbing increasing public debt, but the government
should aim for lower debt ratios,” she said.  Ghana’s tax revenue as a ratio of GDP dropped to 14 percent
from 23 percent after the country resized its economy last year
saying it was bigger than previously thought, Khan said.  “The average for sub-Saharan African economies is 18
percent,” she said. “ Ghana  should look at the new economic
activities that helped to boost GDP during the rebasing for new
tax resources.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
