Dogan Online, the online unit of
 Dogan Sirketler Grubu Holdings (DOHOL)  AS, is seeking to grow through
acquisitions and may sell shares to the public, Hurriyet
reported, quoting chairwoman Hanzade Dogan Boyner.  The unit has achieved 700 million liras in revenue ($375
million) through organic growth and is now looking to expand
through acquisitions, possibly in advertising technology or e-
commerce, Boyner was quoted as saying by the newspaper at the
Webrazzi Summit in Istanbul.  Dogan Online’s bid for shopping site Grupfoni was
unsuccessful after the two sides couldn’t agree, Hurriyet cited
her as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
