A record number of sub-Saharan
African nations made changes to make it easier to open and
operate businesses, a  World Bank  report showed.  About four out of five, or 78 percent, of governments in
the world’s poorest region improved procedures to run a company,
according to the Washington-based organization’s 2012 Doing
Business report, which measures the ease of conducting business
in 183 nations.  “This is good news for entrepreneurs in the region, where
starting and running a business is still costlier and more
complex than in any other region of the world,” it said. “In a
region where relatively little attention was paid to the
regulatory environment only eight years ago, regulatory reforms
making it easier to do business were implemented in 36 of 46
economies.”  Cape Verde ’s ranking improved the most among sub-Saharan
African nations, jumping 10 spots to 119th. Mauritius was the
highest-ranked country in the region at 23rd, followed by  South
Africa  at 35th. Rwanda, which climbed to 67th from 143rd in the
2010 report, rose to 45.  The number of changes made by governments worldwide rose 13
percent to 245, below the record of 287 set in the 2010 report.  Singapore was ranked at No. 1, followed by  Hong Kong ,  New
Zealand , the U.S. and Denmark. The U.K. dropped to 7th place
from 6th and Norway advanced to 6th.  South Korea  made it into
the top 10 nations for the first time at No. 8.  Morocco, Moldova and Macedonia improved the most among
nations that implemented changes in three or more categories,
the report said. Cape Verde,  Sierra Leone  and Burundi were in
the top 10 nations that implemented the most changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
