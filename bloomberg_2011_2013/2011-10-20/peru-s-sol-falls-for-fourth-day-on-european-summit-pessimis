Peru’s sol fell to the lowest in a
week as concern European leaders will struggle to agree on a
solution to the region’s debt crisis at a summit this weekend
hurt demand for higher-yielding emerging-market assets.  The sol earlier fell to 2.7285 per  U.S. dollar , its lowest
level since Oct. 13. It closed little changed at 2.7245, from
2.7235 yesterday.  “Uncertainty regarding Europe is the common driver in
Latin American currencies today,” said  Hugo Perea , chief
economist at BBVA Banco Continental in Lima.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  canceled a planned speech
to parliament tomorrow because of a deadlock over proposals to
leverage the European Financial Stability Facility, three German
lawmakers said.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.74 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The bond’s price fell 0.06 centimo to 114.30
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
