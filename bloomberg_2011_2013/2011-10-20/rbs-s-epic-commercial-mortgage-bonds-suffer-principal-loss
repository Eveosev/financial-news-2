Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ’s
Epic (Industrious) Plc commercial mortgage-backed securitization
suffered a 79 million-pound ($125 million) principal loss on its
senior bonds, the first such loss in  Europe .  Investors in Epic’s 299.7 million pounds of top-rated class
A notes were repaid 221.02 million pounds, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Mezzanine and junior notes totaling 173
million pounds were fully written off.  It’s the first European CMBS issue to suffer a loss on its
senior notes, according to  Barclays Capital  and SG Cross Asset
Research.  “To our knowledge, this is the first European senior class
formerly rated AAA that suffered a principal loss,” said
Christian Aufsatz, a CMBS analyst at Barclays in  London . “The
deal suffered from a portfolio fire sale at the bottom of the
market.”  RBS issued total 487.5 million pounds of bonds on September
2006, according to Bloomberg data. The synthetic transaction was
secured on 120 industrial properties in the U.K., according to
Moody’s Investors Service, which gave the senior rated notes at
its top investment grade.  In a synthetic transaction, the risk of owning the
underlying debt is transferred to investors through credit-
default swaps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
