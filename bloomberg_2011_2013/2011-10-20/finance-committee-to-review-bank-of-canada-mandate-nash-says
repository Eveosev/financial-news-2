Canadian lawmakers voted to study
whether the  Bank of Canada ’s monetary policy mandate should be
broadened to include other targets such as full employment.  The House of Commons  Finance Committee  voted today to hold
at least one meeting before the end of November on the matter.
The current Bank of  Canada  mandate, which calls for the central
bank to target 2 percent annual inflation, expires at the end of
the year.  The committee will “hear from witnesses on whether or not
the government of Canada and the Bank of Canada should consider
other targets such as, but not limited to, nominal GDP or full
employment,” according to the motion that passed today.  The motion also says Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  is
scheduled to speak in front of the committee on Nov. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
