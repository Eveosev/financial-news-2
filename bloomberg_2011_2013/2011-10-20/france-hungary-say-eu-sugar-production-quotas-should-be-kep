France  and  Hungary  agreed on the
need for a “strong” European Union Common Agricultural Policy,
including a budget that is maintained at least at the existing
level, the French Agriculture Ministry said.  France’s Agriculture Minister Bruno Le Maire met with
Hungary’s Rural Development Minister Sandor Fazekas today, and
they agreed that production controls including sugar quotas and
vine-planting rights should be maintained, the French ministry
said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
