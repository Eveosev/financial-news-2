Inter Ikea Holding SA, the closely
held owner of the Ikea retail franchise, said it plans to build
1,200 homes plus commercial buildings on a site near  London ’s
Olympic Park.  LandProp, Inter Ikea’s non-retail development arm,
purchased 9.34 acres (3.78 hectares) from Olympic Park Legacy
Co. for an unspecified sum, according to a statement today from
its Luxembourg-registered parent company. Combined with land it
already owns, the purchase forms a 26-acre development site.  LandProp today presented its plans to redevelop the
derelict area, which lies half a mile south of where London will
host the  2012 Olympic Games . It will apply early next year for
consent to build the homes, 480,000 square feet (44,600 square
meters) of offices as well as shops, restaurants and a 350-
bedroom hotel.  The “Strand East” project “marks the first major
investment for LandProp into the U.K.,” LandProp Managing
Director Harald Mueller said in the statement. “We are
continuing to look for other opportunities within London and the
U.K.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
