Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) , operator of the
Wynn and Encore casinos, fell 5.3 percent after disappointing
investors who expected a special dividend and reporting profit
that missed analysts’ estimates.  The company’s failure to declare a special payout
“likely” caused the drop,  Joseph Greff , a JPMorgan Chase & Co.
analyst, said yesterday in a note. Wynn, based in  Las Vegas , has
paid a special dividend in four of the last five years.  Wynn closed at $123.37 in New York. The shares were up 25
percent this year before today.  Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Wynn  said on a conference
call yesterday the board is also weighing the company’s
investment opportunities in Macau.  “Special dividends are in fact special and there’s no
certainty about what the board will decide to do about that
going forward,” said Wynn, who is also the company’s founder
and chairman. Shareholders can still “count on” the 50-cent a
share quarterly dividend, he said.  Third-quarter profit excluding some items was $1.05 a
share, missing the $1.19 average of 24 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The company said an 8.3 percent decline
in net-casino revenue was driven by the annual difference in
baccarat winnings.  The issue of a special dividend remains a possibility early
next year after Wynn secures final government approval and
financing for the Cotai property, Greff said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
