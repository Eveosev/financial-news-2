The zloty slid to the lowest in two
weeks against the euro on concern European leaders will struggle
to agree on a solution to the regionâ€™s debt crisis at a summit
this weekend.  The zloty lost 1.1 percent to 4.3894 against the euro as of
4:37 p.m. in Warsaw, its weakest intraday level since Oct. 6. It
weakened the most among more than 20 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
