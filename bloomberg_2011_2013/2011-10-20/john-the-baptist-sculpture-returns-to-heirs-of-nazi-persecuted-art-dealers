A limewood sculpture of John the
Baptist dating from 1510 will be returned to the U.S.-based
heirs of a Jewish art-dealer couple persecuted by the Nazis, the
state of Baden-Wuerttemberg said.  The sculpture, housed in the  Landesmuseum Wuerttemberg  in
Stuttgart, was auctioned without the owners’ permission in 1937,
said an e-mailed statement from Baden-Wuerttemberg’s  Ministry
for Science, Research and Art . The couple, Jacob and Rosa
Oppenheimer, had fled Berlin in 1933. Their art was impounded in
1935, according to ministry spokesman Jochen Laun.  “The state has a historical and moral responsibility to
investigate and give back cultural goods seized from those who
were persecuted by the Nazi regime,” Baden-Wuerttemberg Art
Minister Theresia Bauer said in the statement.  Germany  is one of 44 countries which endorsed the non-
binding Washington Principles in 1998. Countries pledged to
restitute or reach a settlement with the heirs on art in public
collections that was looted by the Nazis.  Jacob Oppenheimer died in exile in Nice in 1941. His wife
was imprisoned in a French camp before being deported to
Auschwitz in 1943 and murdered that same year.  The sculpture, showing a curly-bearded John the Baptist
cradling a lamb, was carved in Bavarian Swabia by an artist
whose identity remains unknown. The museum acquired the
sculpture in 1985 from a private Swiss collector.  To contact the writer on the story:
