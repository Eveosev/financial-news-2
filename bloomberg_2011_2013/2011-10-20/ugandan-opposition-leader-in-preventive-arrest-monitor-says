Uganda opposition leader Kizza
Besigye is under “preventive arrest” which means he isn’t
allowed to leave the inner compound of his home to block him
from so-called walk-to-work protests, Daily Monitor said, citing
Ibin Senkumbi, a spokesman for the Kampala Metropolitan Police.  The police will continue deployment at his home, where he
isn’t allowed to access his surrounding farm, until they are
sure he is no longer a “threat,” the Kampala-based newspaper
reported, citing Senkumbi.  The opposition restarted walk-to-work protests on Oct. 17
over rising living costs as inflation in the East African nation
surged to an 18-year high. At least 11 people died and more than
480 injured during protests in April and May, according to the
Uganda Red Cross.  For Web Site See:  http:///www.monitor.co.ug   To contact the reporter on this story:
