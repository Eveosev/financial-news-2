BB&T Corp. (BBT) , the ninth-largest U.S.
bank by deposits, reported a 74 percent increase in third-
quarter profit as provisions for bad loans declined.  Net income rose to $366 million, or 52 cents a share, from
$210 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier, the Winston-Salem,
North Carolina-based bank said today in a statement. The average
estimate of 34 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for 50 cents.
Provisions for credit losses fell 68 percent to $250 million.  BB&T, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kelly King, 63, slashed the amount set aside for credit losses in the
first and second quarters to about half of last year’s level.
King said in September that the bank will focus on expenses as a
result of lower revenue caused by new U.S. rules, including the
 Federal Reserve ’s capping of so-called debit-card swipe fees at
21 cents from an average of 44 cents.  “The increase was driven by significantly improved  credit
quality  and improved net interest income,” King said in today’s
statement. “All our leading indicators for loan growth are
positive, with robust pipelines and solid momentum as we enter
the fourth quarter.”  Total revenue fell $313 million to $2.1 billion from the
year earlier. The decline was led by a 38 percent drop in  non-
interest income  from last year. The bank reported a $39 million
securities loss, compared with a $239 million gain in the year-
earlier period. Mortgage-banking income declined 33 percent to
$123 million.  Debit-Card Revenue  Net interest income rose to $1.42 billion in the third
quarter from $1.31 billion a year earlier. The net interest
margin, the difference between what a bank pays in deposits and
charges for loans, remained flat at 4.09 percent from last year.
It fell from 4.15 percent in the second quarter.  BB&T is “totally committed” to recapturing revenue lost
from the cap on swipe-fees, King said on a conference call after
results were announced. Chief Financial Officer Daryl Bible said
fourth-quarter fee income will be “stronger” even with an
estimated $35 million in lower revenue from debit-card fees.  Total loans and leases at Sept. 30 was $107.4 billion, up
from $106 billion last year.  Net charge-offs fell 52 percent to $419 million in the
third quarter from a year earlier. The allowance for credit
losses decreased to $2.41 billion from $2.65 billion.  Tier 1 common equity ratio rose to 9.8 percent from 9
percent a year earlier.  BB&T rose 23 cents, or 1 percent, to $22.53 at 4:15 p.m. in
 New York . The shares have declined 14 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
