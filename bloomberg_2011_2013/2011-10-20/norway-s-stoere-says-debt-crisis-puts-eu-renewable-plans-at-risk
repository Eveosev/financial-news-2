Norway ’s Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr
Stoere said  Europe ’s debt crisis puts the region’s plans to
boost renewable energy use at risk and creates “uncertainty”
for Norway’s natural-gas exports.  “For us the picture is that there’s more uncertainty,”
Stoere said in an interview today in Oslo. “We’re still the
supplier of an important energy resource to Europe, but it’s
important to understand those changes in Europe so we can still
play the role that we play today.”  Norway needs “to make gas even more of an attractive
environmental alternative and it needs to fit into the
infrastructure decisions Europe now takes on its road to
renewable,” he said.  Norway is the second-largest supplier of natural gas to
Europe after  Russia .  The country also has the “possibility” to increase sales
of liquefied natural gas to Asia, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
