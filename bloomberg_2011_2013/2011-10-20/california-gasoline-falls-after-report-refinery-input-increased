California-blend gasoline in  Los
Angeles  fell for a fourth straight day after the state reported
an increase in throughput at refineries last week.  The premium for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
Los Angeles fell 4.88 cents to 17 cents a gallon above gasoline
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:57 p.m.
East Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
the lowest premium for the fuel since Sept 21.  California’s Energy Department said yesterday that crude
oil input at state refineries rose 2.2 percent to 11.2 million
barrels in the week ended Oct. 14.  “The outlook for California gasoline is very bearish,”
said Bob Van Der Valk, an independent fuel pricing analyst in
Terry,  Montana . Increased oil supplies from Libya and Canada
will probably keep pressure on prices, he said.  San Francisco Carbob slipped 1.88 cents to a premium of 14
cents over gasoline futures.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Portland , Oregon, rose 3.88 cents to 29.88 cents versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
