Phil Flynn , vice president of
research at PBFBest in  Chicago , talks about the death of Libya’s
Muammar Qaddafi and the impact that will have on oil output from
the African nation.  Flynn spoke in a telephone interview today with Bloomberg
News.  Qaddafi, whose dictatorship lasted 42 years, died after
being captured by forces led by the Misrata Military Council,
the group said.  On resumption of oil output:  “Qaddafi has been a dead man walking for weeks. It reduces
some of the concern that Libya is going to become another Iraq
for getting the oil production back on.”  “It increases the odds that oil production will come back
sooner rather than later and it will come back smoothly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
