A group led by Autostrade per
l’Italia SpA, has won a 2.8 billion euro ($3.8 billion) contract
to for a truck tolling system for French roads.  The system will use satellite tracking to charge trucks
using 15,000 kilometers (8,800 miles) of non-toll national
roads. Trucks already pay tolls on French highways, and the so-
called “eco-tax” for national roads was decided by the French
government in 2008.  The system should be running by mid-2013, Giovanni Castellucci, chief executive officer for Autostrade’s parent
company  Atlantia SpA (ATL) , told reporters in Paris last week. The
French government, which is expecting revenue of about 1 billion
euros a year from the project, will pay Autostrade’s group 2.8
billion euros, he said.  Autostrade will have 70 percent of the consortium. French
electronics company  Thales SA (HO)  will have 11 percent, national
railroad operator SNCF 10 percent, SFR, the cell phone unit of
 Vivendi SA (VIV) , 6 percent, and software company  Groupe Steria SCA (RIA)  3
percent.  Financing is being provided by a syndicate of banks
including Deutsche Bank AG, Banca IMI SpA,  Mediobanca SpA (MB) ,
 UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) ’s Calyon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
