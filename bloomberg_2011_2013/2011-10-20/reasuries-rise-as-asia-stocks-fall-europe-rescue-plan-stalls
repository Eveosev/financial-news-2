Treasuries rose for a second day as
stocks slid amid concern France and  Germany  are in disagreement
over how to resolve the region’s debt crisis, spurring demand
for safer assets.  Benchmark 10-year yields approached the lowest in two weeks
as a split between the two nations emerged over Europe’s rescue
strategy before a summit in Brussels this weekend. The extra
yield investors demand to buy benchmark 10-year Treasuries
instead of two-year notes narrowed for a second day.  “Since late yesterday, the tone of the headlines has been
more disappointing, casting doubt on whether a comprehensive
solution can be reached at the weekend,” said  Christoph Rieger ,
head of fixed-income strategy at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt .
“Treasuries are outperforming and should continue to outperform
given what’s going on here in  Europe .”  The 10-year yield fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 2.14 percent at 9:11 a.m. London time, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.125 percent security
maturing in August 2021 gained 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 27/32.  The difference in yield, or spread, between two- and 10-
year notes shrank two basis points to 187 basis points.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares slid 0.9 percent and
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 1.8 percent, erasing gains
from yesterday.  Europe’s leaders are searching for ways to maximize the
firepower of the 440 billion-euro ($603 billion) European
Financial Stability Facility as the debt crisis threatens to
spread to the region’s larger economies. A proposal to use the
fund to guarantee some bond sales may violate the European
Union’s restrictions on bailouts, the Wall Street Journal
reported yesterday.  Euro, Bunds  The euro slid 0.4 percent to $1.3710 and the yield on 10-
year German bunds, Europe’s benchmark government debt
securities, dropped three basis points to 2.03 percent.  “There is still a flight to quality,” said Zeal Yin, a
 money manager  at Taipei-based Shin Kong Life Insurance Co.,
 Taiwan ’s second-largest life insurer with the equivalent of
$39.7 billion in assets. “The problem is not solved” in
Europe, he said. Shin Kong Life increased its Treasury holdings
this month, favoring 10- and 30-year maturities, Yin said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
