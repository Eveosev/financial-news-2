Waking up early may increase your
risk of heart attack and stroke, a study in  Japan  shows.  A one-hour advance in the wake-up time of study
participants increased the risk of hardening of the arteries by
1.2 times even without a change in sleep duration, according to
the results reported by Mayuko Kadono at Kyoto Prefectural
University. The study, which analyzed 3,066 healthy adults
averaging 57.2 years old, also found people who had difficulty
falling or maintaining sleep at night had a higher prevalence of
hypertension.  The analysis underscores Kadono’s previous study that
showed links between vascular dysfunction and waking up before 5
a.m. Cardiovascular disease, which includes heart attack, stroke,
and high  blood pressure , may kill 23.6 million people by 2030,
rising from 17.3 million in 2008, according to the  World Health
Organization .  Earlier bedtimes and earlier wake-up times “had a larger
influence on vascular condition than sleep duration,” Kadono,
an endocrinologist, said in an interview yesterday. “People
generally go to bed earlier and get up earlier as they age. Age-
associated changes of rhythm and sleep forms might influence
vascular condition.”  The summary of the study didn’t specify participants’
sleeping times and duration. The results were presented at the
6th World Congress of the World Sleep Federation, which opened
in Kyoto, Japan, on Oct. 16 and ends today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
