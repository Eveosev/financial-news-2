The European Union called on the
National Transition Council in  Libya  to “pursue a broad-based
reconciliation” following reports of the death of Muammar Qaddafi.  “The reported death of Muammar Qaddafi marks the end of an
era of despotism and repression from which the Libyan people
have suffered for too long,” EU President Herman Van Rompuy and
European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said today in a joint
statement. “Today Libya can turn a page in its history and
embrace a new democratic future,” they said.  “We call on the National Transitional Council to pursue a
broad-based reconciliation process which reaches out to all
Libyans and enables a democratic, peaceful and transparent
transition in the country,” according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
