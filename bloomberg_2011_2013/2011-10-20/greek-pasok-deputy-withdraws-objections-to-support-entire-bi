Greek ruling party lawmaker Vasso
Papandreou said today that she will support all articles in the
government’s austerity bill to ensure  Greece  receives a sixth
loan payment under an EU-led bailout.  “I had decided to vote against Article 37 as a symbolic
act that the Greek parliament still has a role to play, to send
a message,” Papandreou told Parliament in  Athens  today. “I met
with the Prime Minister who assured me that if even one article
isn’t passed the sixth tranche won’t be paid. I can’t take this
responsibility that we won’t be paid the 6th tranche.”  Papandreou said she will support the bill in its entirety,
adding “but it is the last time.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
