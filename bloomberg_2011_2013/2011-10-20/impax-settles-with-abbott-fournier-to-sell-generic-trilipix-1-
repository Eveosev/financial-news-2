Impax Laboratories Inc. (IPXL)  said it
settled patent litigation with  Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  and its
Fournier Laboratories Ireland Ltd. unit, permitting Impax to
sell a generic version of the cholesterol drug TriLipix as early
as 2013.  Impax, based in Hayward, California, may sell delayed-
release capsules of TriLipix starting July 15, 2013, “under
certain circumstances in the settlement agreement” that weren’t
spelled out in a regulatory filing today. Otherwise, Impax may
offer generic versions in 45-milligram or 135-milligram doses on
Jan. 1, 2014, the filing said.  TriLipix  reduces cholesterol and fatty acids called
triglycerides in the blood. The drug, whose chemical name is
choline fenofibrate, is a delayed-release version of Abbott’s
 TriCor  medicine. Sales of Trilipix and TriCor were $963 million
in the U.S. in the first nine months of the year, Abbott said in
an earnings statement yesterday.  The agreement “allows Abbott to obtain certainty for our
product and avoid costly litigation around our patent,” said
Scott Stoffel, a spokesman for Abbott Park, Illinois-based
Abbott.  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , the world’s biggest
generic-drug maker, plans to begin selling a generic version of
TriCor in July under an earlier lawsuit settlement with Abbott.  The case is Abbott Laboratories v. Impax Laboratories, 10-
cv-1322, U.S. District Court, District of  New Jersey  (Newark).  To contact the reporters on this story:
