The  life-expectancy  gap between the
Scots and the English has widened even as people in both nations
are living for longer, the Scotsman said, citing data from the
Office for  National Statistics and the Registers of  Scotland .  A boy born in Glasgow in 2010 can expect to live 13.5 years
less than a boy born in the municipality of Kensington and
Chelsea in  London , the Edinburgh-based newspaper said. The gap
is a year more than it was four years previously. The gap for
girls widened by 1.7 years in the period.  The average life expectancy for Scottish males is 75.8
years, compared with a U.K. average of 78.2 years. For Scottish
women, the average is 80.4 years against a U.K. figure of 82.3
years, the Scotsman said.  Scots are likely to have shorter lives than the Welsh or
the Northern Irish, as well as the English, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
