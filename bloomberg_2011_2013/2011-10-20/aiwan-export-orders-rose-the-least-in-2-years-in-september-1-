Taiwan ’s export orders increased by
the least in two years in September, indicating the export-led
economy remains under pressure from a faltering global recovery.  Orders, an indication of shipments in the next one to three
months, climbed 2.72 percent from a year earlier, after a 5.26
percent gain in August, the  Ministry of Economic Affairs  said in
Taipei today. The median of 11 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a 3.46 percent advance.  Asia’s expansion is easing as faltering recoveries in the
U.S. and  Europe  weigh on the region.  China ’s economy grew at the
slowest pace since 2009 last quarter, Bank Indonesia cut rates
this month and the Bank of  Thailand  yesterday kept its benchmark
one-day bond repurchase rate at 3.5 percent, ending its longest
series of increases since 2006.  “Weakening global demand” prompted last month’s slowdown
in orders, Cheng Cheng-mount, a Taipei-based economist at
Citigroup Inc., said before the report.  The monetary authority will probably keep borrowing costs
unchanged at 1.875 percent through the end of next year, he
said.  The Taiex stock index fell 1.5 percent today before the
release. The Taiwan dollar declined 0.6 percent to NT$30.269
against its U.S. counterpart at the 4 p.m. close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc.  Overseas Demand  Overseas shipments account for about two-thirds of Taiwan’s
$355 billion economy, with China its largest trading partner.  The government in August cut its forecast for 2011 growth
to 4.81 percent from 5.01 percent and said the expansion will
slow to 4.58 percent in 2012. That’s less than half the 2010
pace of 10.9 percent, which was the fastest expansion in  Asia 
behind Singapore’s, according to International Monetary Fund
data.  The central bank last month refrained from raising  interest
rates , ending five straight quarters of increases as Asian
policy makers seek to protect their economies.  The value of export orders advanced to $36.96 billion last
month from $36.71 billion in August, today’s report showed.  Orders from  Japan  fell 13.19 percent in September from a
year earlier, after declining 9.52 percent in August. Demand
from China and  Hong Kong  combined increased 5.67 percent, after
rising 3.44 percent. Purchases from the U.S. climbed 9.33
percent, compared with a 9.05 percent gain in August. Orders
from Europe were down 2.22 percent, after gaining 8.08 percent
in August.  Orders for electronics fell 3.2 percent in September from a
year earlier, following a 0.74 percent decline the previous
month. Demand for information technology and communications
products climbed 2.89 percent, after rising 9.88 percent in
August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
