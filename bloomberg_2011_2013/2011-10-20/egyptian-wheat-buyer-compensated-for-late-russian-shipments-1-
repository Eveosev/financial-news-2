Egypt ’s main state wheat buyer, the
 General Authority  for Supply Commodities, is being compensated
for Russian wheat purchases which were delayed due to railroad
congestion, said Nomani Nomani, GASC’s vice chairman.  The authority, which has purchased mostly Russian wheat
this year, has had shipment delays of up to a week, Nomani told
reporters at a Russian grains conference in Sharm el-Sheikh,
Egypt today. The wheat remains “competitive,” he said.  “There were delays as all my wheat shipments come mostly
from Novorossiysk,” Nomani said. “The suppliers are paying the
penalties, not me.”  Russia’s monopoly rail operator lifted a ban on shipments
of grains to OAO Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port on Sept. 7,
while restrictions at a terminal owned by state grain trade
United Grain Co. remain in place. OAO Russian Railways imposed
the ban on Aug. 27 because of a backlog of freight cars near the
ports.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
