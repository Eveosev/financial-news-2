Pernod Ricard SA raised $1.5 billion
selling bonds to repay loans after the maker of Chivas Regal
whisky had its  credit rating  lifted to investment grade by
 Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service.  Pernod is paying its lowest coupon on record for debt
maturing in more than 10 years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Its 4.45 percent senior unsecured notes due in
January 2022 yield 230 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries. That compares with a spread of 245 basis points on
its first U.S. dollar bond sale in April, when the Paris-based
company issued $1 billion of 5.75 percent notes maturing in
April 2021.  S&P boosted Pernod’s credit rating one step this month,
following a similar move from Moody’s in September, as  Europe ’s
second-largest distiller seeks to reduce borrowings to around 4
times adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization by June 2012. The company is working to refinance a
syndicated  bank loan  maturing in July 2013, which had 4.3
billion euros ($5.9 billion) outstanding at the end of June from
6.9 billion euros a year earlier, according to S&P.  “The upgrade primarily reflects our view of Pernod’s
progress in reducing its debt leverage, in line with its
recently revised financial policy,” S&P analysts Florence
Devevey and Nicolas Baudouin wrote in a note on Oct. 3. “Pernod
should be able to successfully refinance its bank facility
maturing in 2013 within the next 12 months.”  Pernod reiterated its debt to EBITDA goal today as it
reported first-quarter “organic” revenue growth of 11 percent
today after a gain of 8 percent last year.  The company reported debt of 9 billion euros as of June 30,
or 4.4 times adjusted Ebitda.  The company got a lower borrowing cost than similarly rated
companies, as the average BBB bond yields 4.58 percent,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  Sonoco Products Co., the maker of packaging products, sold
$500 million of debt to fund its acquisition of Tegrant Corp.
today, Bloomberg data show. Lab instrument-maker PerkinElmer
Inc. issued $500 million of 5 percent, 10-year notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
