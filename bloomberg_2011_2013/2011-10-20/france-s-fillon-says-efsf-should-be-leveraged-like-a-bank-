French Prime Minister  Francois
Fillon  said European governments should agree to use leverage to
make the region’s financial support fund “massive.”  The European Financial Stability Facility “needs to be
massive,” Fillon told an audience of entrepreneurs in Paris.
“The 440 billion euros need to be used with a leverage effect,
a bit like a bank.”  Fillon also said that the euro area needs to do everything
it can to avoid a Greek default.  “Nothing would be worse than this solution,” Fillon said.
“If you accept the bankruptcy of  Greece , you accept that of
Greek banks. Then you bring down European financial system and
allow eurozone to explode.”  Fillon said the  International Monetary Fund  and the
European Union need to agree on a level of write-downs on Greek
debt “once and for all.” He said European leaders meeting in
Brussels Oct. 23 will set out a plan to re-capitalize banks that
starts with pressing them to find funds without government help.  To contact the reporter on this story:
