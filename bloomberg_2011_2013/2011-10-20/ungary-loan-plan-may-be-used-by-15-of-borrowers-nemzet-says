Some 15 percent of Hungarian
borrowers holding foreign-currency mortgages would repay the
loans in a lump sum at below-market exchange rates set by the
government,  Magyar Nemzet  reported, citing a poll by Szazadveg.  Some 3 percent of borrowers would opt for a different plan
that allows the repayment of foreign-currency loans at set
exchange rates for three years, the newspaper said, adding that
25 percent of eligible borrowers were undecided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
