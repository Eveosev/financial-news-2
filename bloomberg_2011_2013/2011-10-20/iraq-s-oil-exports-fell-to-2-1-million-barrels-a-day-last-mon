Iraq ’s crude oil exports fell 4
percent to 2.1 million barrels a day in September, according to
Oil Ministry data.  OPEC’s third-largest producer shipped 53 million barrels
from the port of Basra and 10.1 from the oil hub of Kirkuk in
the north, according to data on the ministry’s  website . That
compares with 53.6 million barrels and 14.3 million from the two
hubs, respectively, in August.  Iraq, holder of the world’s fifth-largest oil reserves,
depends on crude for most state revenue. Income from oil exports
was $6.62 billion in September, down from $7.12 billion a month
earlier, the data show. The government is struggling to raise
exports and is seeking foreign investors to boost output after
decades of conflict and sanctions destroyed its infrastructure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
