The Bloomberg consumer survey 
of U.S. economic expectations fell this month.   Consumers were asked ‘Do you think the nation’s economy
is getting better, getting worse or staying the same?’  NOTE: Economic expectations are tracked in the ongoing Bloomberg Consumer
Comfort survey via random-sample telephone interviews with 500 Americans in
the first two weeks of each month. The survey is produced by Langer Research
Associates of  New York , with field work by SSRS/Social Science Research
Solutions of Media., Pa. Results to this question have a 4.5-point margin of
sampling error.    SOURCE: Bloomberg News  To contact the reporter on this story:
