The lira weakened for a second day
as  Europe ’s debt worries dented appetite for riskier emerging
market assets and before the central bank’s meeting on interest
rates.  The lira slid 0.2 percent 1.8726 per dollar at 9:09 a.m.,
extending its losses this year to 17.6 percent, making the
currency the second worst-performer among emerging currencies
after South African rand.  A French-German split over Europe’s rescue strategy emerged
as finance ministers prepare to meet in Brussels tomorrow under
pressure to craft a solution to the region’s debt crisis.
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , who chairs the
group of euro-area finance ministers, indicated an impromptu
meeting of European leaders in  Frankfurt  last night failed to
resolve differences. “We are still meeting,” he said as he
departed.  “It is likely that continued delays to progress in the
Eurozone will see further upside for the dollar against the lira
although a less dovish statement from the central bank today
could generate a relief rally in the lira,” Johannesburg-based
Tradition Analytics said in an e-mailed report to clients.  The central bank will probably hold the one-week repo rate
at a historic low of 5.75 percent, according to all 14
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank will announce its
decision at 2 p.m. in Ankara today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
