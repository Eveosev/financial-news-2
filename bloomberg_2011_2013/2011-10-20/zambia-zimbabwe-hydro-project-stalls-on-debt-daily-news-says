The proposed 800-megawatt Batoka
hydroelectric plant near Victoria Falls won’t be built until
 Zimbabwe  pays  Zambia  for debts incurred more than 50 years ago,
the  Daily News  reported, citing Tapiwa Mashakada, Zimbabwe’s
investment minister.  Zambia says it’s owed money from when Britain, then the
colonial ruler, created the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland
in 1953, the Daily News reported. Mashakada declined to comment
on the size of the debt, saying only that Zimbabwe had agreed to
pay it, according to the newspaper.  Zambia was named Northern Rhodesia until it gained
independence from Britain in 1964, a year after the federation
was dissolved and a year before Southern Rhodesia’s Unilateral
Declaration of Independence. Nyasaland also gained independence
in 1964, when it became Malawi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
