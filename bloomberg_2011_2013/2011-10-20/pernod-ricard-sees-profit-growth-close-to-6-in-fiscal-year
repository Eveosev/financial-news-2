Pernod-Ricard SA (RI)  forecast profit
growth of close to 6 percent this fiscal year on “strong
dynamism in emerging markets” and slower growth in developed
markets.  Profit from recurring operations will increase close to 6
percent on a like-for-like basis, the Paris-based company said
today. Pernod will reduce debt, lowering the ratio of net debt
to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
to close to 4 on June 30, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
