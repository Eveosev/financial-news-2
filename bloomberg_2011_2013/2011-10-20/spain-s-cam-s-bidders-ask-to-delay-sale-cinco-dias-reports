The sale of savings bank  Caja de
Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM)  will be delayed until after  Spain ’s
general elections on Nov. 20 on potential bidders’ request,
 Cinco Dias  reported citing unidentified people in the banking
sector.  Banks interested in buying Alicante-based CAM are seeking a
larger  credit line  from the Bank of Spain as part of the savings
bank’s rescue operation, the newspaper reports.  Banco Santander SA (SAN) ,  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
Banco Sabadell SA and Barcelona-based CaixaBank are among the
possible bidders, some of which have requested more time to
consider a takeover, Cinco Dias said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
