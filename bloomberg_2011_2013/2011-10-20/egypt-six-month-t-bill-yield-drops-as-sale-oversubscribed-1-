The average yield on Egyptian six-
month treasury bills sold at an auction today fell and  demand
for the securities was more than twice the amount offered. The
yield on one-year notes rose.  The average yield on six-month notes declined three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 13.071 percent compared
with the sale of similar maturity bills last week, according to
Finance Ministry data. The rate on one-year securities advanced
six basis points to 13.777 percent.  Egypt  has asked Persian Gulf governments to invest in its
 government securities  to help lower borrowing costs, which are
near their highest levels in three years.  Saudi Arabia  plans to
invest $500 million in Egypt’s T-bills and will give the Arab
country another $500 million to finance its  budget deficit , the
kingdom’s ambassador to Egypt Ahmed al-Qattan said Oct. 16. The
announcement came after Qatar provided Egypt with $500 million
in budgetary support earlier this month.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due
April 2020 advanced two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 5.83 percent at 1:44 p.m. in Cairo. Twelve-month non-
deliverable forwards for the pound retreated 0.3 percent to 6.7
per dollar, reflecting an expectation for the currency to weaken
12 percent over the life of the contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
