Turkey  is likely to increase costs
for passports and exit stamps significantly,  Aksam  reported,
citing its analysis of the government’s projected income.  The cost of an exit stamp for Turkish citizens to travel
abroad is expected to rise after the government budget showed a
76 percent increase in income from the stamps next year to 111.6
million ($59.7 million) liras from 63.3 million liras this year,
the Istanbul-based newspaper said.  Passport fees are also seen rising after the government
budget indicated a 14.4 percent increase in income from
passports to 864 million liras.  Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek is signaling a “wave of tax
increases” that may come in the form of increased fees after
the government raised the special  consumption tax  on cars,
mobile phones, alcohol and cigarettes last week, Aksam said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
