Jas Infrastructure & Power Ltd.
expects to close a project finance facility for 60 billion
rupees ($1.2 billion) by the end of the year after attracting
about nine lenders, in addition to the three banks hired to
arrange the loan, in syndication, according to a person familiar
with the matter.  Jas Infrastructure hired  Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB) , Punjab National
Bank and  Uco Bank (UCO)  in April to help arrange the 14-year,
floating-rate loan, proceeds of which will be used to build a
1,320 megawatt coal-based thermal power plant in the eastern
Indian state of Bihar, the person said, asking not to be
identified as details are private.  About 90 percent of the funds have been committed and Axis
expects another two to three lenders to join the bank group
before the loan is signed, the person said. The power plant is
expected to be complete by December 2014, the person said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
