Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  Chairman Luis
Del Rivero agreed with two other shareholders to jointly vote
their stock in the Spanish construction company, forming a block
that controls 26.95 percent of the shares.  Del Rivero, who owns 12.59 percent of Sacyr, Jose Manuel
Loureda with 12.65 percent and Francisco Gayo with 1.71 percent
also agreed to press for more representation on the company’s
board, they said in the text of agreement filed with regulators.  Del Rivero is looking to shore up his position at Sacyr
after facing criticism from investors over his clash with  Repsol
YPF SA (REP)  Chairman Antonio Brufau. Novacaixagalicia, the Spanish
savings bank that owns 8.75 percent of Sacyr, this month urged
Del Rivero to resolve the dispute, arguing that it would
increase his chances of boosting dividend income.  Sacyr, Repsol’s largest shareholder, is pushing Brufau to
boost shareholder payouts as it negotiates the refinancing of a
4.9 billion-euro ($6.7 billion) loan that is due for repayment
in December. Del Rivero signed a deal with  Petroleos Mexicanos ,
Repsol’s third-biggest shareholder, in August in which they
agreed to press Brufau, who is also CEO, to appoint a separate
chief executive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
