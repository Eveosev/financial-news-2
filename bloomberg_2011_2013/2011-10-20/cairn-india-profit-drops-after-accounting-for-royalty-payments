Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) , the energy
explorer being acquired by  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , posted a
worse-than-expected drop in fiscal second-quarter profit after
accounting for royalty payments for the first time.  Net income, including that of units, fell 52 percent to
7.63 billion rupees ($154 million), or 4 rupees a share, in the
three months ended Sept. 30, the explorer based in Gurgaon near
New Delhi said in a statement yesterday. The median estimate of
23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a profit of 8.5 billion
rupees. Sales declined 1.5 percent to 26.5 billion rupees.  The government approved Vedanta’s $8.7 billion acquisition
of Cairn India on condition that it pay its share of royalties
from the Rajasthan block. Accounting for the royalty paid by
partner Oil & Natural Gas Corp. on its behalf since production
started in the block in August 2009 reduced revenue and profit
in the quarter, Cairn  India  said.  “The royalty payment that they need to reimburse ONGC with
has been the big drag,” said Deepak Darisi, a Mumbai-based
analyst with LKP Shares & Securities Ltd. “That will continue
to be a burden. From the next quarter on, there will be no
pending payments and the burden would be much lower.”  Cairn India fell 2.1 percent to 293.55 rupees in Mumbai
before the earnings announcement, the most since Sept. 26. The
stock has fallen 12 percent this year, compared with a 17
percent drop in the benchmark Sensitive Index.  Royalty deductions will be at about 15 percent from future
Rajasthan crude sales, R. Ranganath, head of finance at Cairn
India, said on a conference call with analysts yesterday.  Vedanta’s Stake  Vedanta, a metals and mining company based in  London  with
no experience in oil and gas, received approval for the takeover
from India’s cabinet on June 30 on condition royalty is included
in the field development cost, which can be recovered from
sales. ONGC approved the acquisition last month after the
conditions were accepted.  Vedanta and its units own 28.5 percent in Cairn India,
while Edinburgh-based  Cairn Energy Plc (CNE)  holds 52 percent, Cairn
Energy said in a July 12 statement. Vedanta will buy an
additional 30 percent in the explorer from Cairn Energy. The
deal was announced in August last year.  Crude output at the Mangala field in Rajasthan climbed 8
percent to 125,251 barrels a day, with Cairn India’s share at
87,676 barrels a day, according to yesterday’s statement. The
share may reduce to about 60 percent from the current 70 percent
because royalty payments would become recoverable, Ranganath
said.  Net oil output, including other fields, rose 5.2 percent to
99,220 barrels of oil equivalent a day, Cairn India said.  The Rajasthan block has three fields that may produce a
combined 240,000 barrels a day, which is about 30 percent of
India’s current crude output, according to the company’s annual
report for the year ended March 31. Production may rise to
175,000 barrels a day by March 31.  Cairn India sells oil at market-linked rates, benchmarked
to Brent crude oil prices. The company sold oil at $102.80 a
barrel compared with $69.50 a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
