Tribune Co., the biggest media
company in bankruptcy, won a judge’s approval to pay the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service $7 million to settle claims it violated
U.S. tax law.  The IRS originally sought $37.5 million in unpaid taxes
related to its almost $13 billion leveraged buyout in 2007,
according to court papers.  The agreement appears to be “in the best interests” of
Tribune and its creditors, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin J. Carey
wrote in an order signed yesterday in Wilmington, Delaware.  Chicago-based Tribune filed for bankruptcy in 2008, one
year after billionaire  Sam Zell  led a buyout that added more
than $8 billion in debt to the company. Tribune owns the Los
Angeles Times, the  Chicago Tribune , and TV and radio stations.  The bankruptcy case is In re Tribune Co., 08-bk-13141,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
