S-Oil Corp. (010950) ,  South Korea ’s third-
biggest oil refiner, completed the expansion of its paraxylene
plant, the first investment since Hanjin Group bought a stake in
the company.  The refiner spent 1.3 trillion won ($1.1 billion) on
building a second complex to increase paraxylene and benzene
output at its Onsan refinery in Ulsan, South Korea, S-Oil said
in an  e-mailed  statement today.  Output at the plant will more than double, enabling the
refiner to generate more than $2 billion of sales a year,
according to the statement. The refinery will produce 1.7
million metric tons of paraxylene, 560,000 tons of benzene and
200,000 tons of propylene a year as well as refine 669,000
barrels of crude a day, according to the statement.  It’s the company’s first project since Hanjin, a South
Korean industrial group, acquired 28.4 percent of S-Oil in April
2007, becoming its second-biggest shareholder. Saudi Arabian Oil
Co. has 35 percent.  Ali Al-Naimi,  Saudi Arabia ’s minister of petroleum,
attended a completion ceremony at the plant, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
