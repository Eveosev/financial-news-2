Polandâ€™s core inflation slowed
to 2.6 percent in September from 2.7 percent in the previous
month, the Warsaw-based Narodowy Bank Polski said in an e-mail.
That figure was below the 2.7 percent median estimate of 22
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The core inflation rate held steady at 0.2 percent on the
month, matching the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 15
economists.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
