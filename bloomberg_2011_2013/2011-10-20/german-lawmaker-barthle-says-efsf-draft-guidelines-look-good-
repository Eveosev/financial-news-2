Draft guidelines for enhancing the
European Financial Stability Facility sent to German lawmakers
overnight “look good,”  Norbert Barthle , budget spokesman for
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, told
reporters today in Berlin.  Barthle and his Free Democratic Party counterpart  Otto Fricke , said in joint statement that the lower house’s budget
committee, which has to approve the guidelines, won’t give its
stamp of approval before Merkel’s parliamentary groups have had
a chance to discuss the proposals.  The budget committee has to back any future changes to the
EFSF’s guidelines, the two spokesmen said in the statement e-
mailed to news organizations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
