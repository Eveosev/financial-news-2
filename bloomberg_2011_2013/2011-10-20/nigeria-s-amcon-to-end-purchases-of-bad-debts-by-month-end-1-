Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria , a
state-owned company that buys non-performing debt from lenders
in the West African nation, said it will complete its
acquisition of bad loans by Oct. 31.  Amcon, as the company, is known, will have bought 2.8
trillion naira ($18 billion) of non-performing loans from 21
banks at a cost of about 1.2 trillion naira by the end this
month, Chief Executive OfficerMustafa Chike-Obi told reporters
today in Lagos, the commercial capital.  Amcon also bought loans that, while performing, were
considered a “risk,” including 275 billion naira owed to lenders
by three Nigerian companies, he said.  Nigeria established Amcon last year as part of measures to
shore up the country’s banking industry after a debt crisis in
2008 and 2009 threatened to collapse some lenders. The central
bank fired the chief executives of eight of Nigeria’s 24 banks
for their role in the crisis and bailed the lenders out with 620
billion naira.  Afribank Nigeria Plc, Bank PHB Plc and Spring Bank Plc,
which were deemed unable to meet a Sept. 30 recapitalization
deadline, were nationalized on Aug. 5 and transferred to Amcon’s
control. Five others were acquired by investors before the
deadline.  Amcon renamed the nationalized lenders and injected 736
billion naira to allow them to meet capital-adequacy
requirements, Chike-Obi said. Another 1.4 trillion naira was
spent to bring the net-assets value of the five lenders that
were acquired by investors to zero, he said.  “Amcon will in the next 10 years focus on the recovery and
restructuring of the acquired assets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
