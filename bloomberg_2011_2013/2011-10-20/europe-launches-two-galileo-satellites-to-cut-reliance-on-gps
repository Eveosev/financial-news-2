Europe’s  Galileo  global navigation
system will launch its first two satellites tomorrow as part of
a project that will require an extra 7 billion euros ($9.6
billion) to continue running until the end of the decade.  The satellites will ride a Russian rocket to be launched
from a space port in  Kourou, French Guiana  to an altitude of
23,600 kilometers (14,667 miles), according to the European
Commission. While 4.5 billion euros have been  allocated  to
develop and build the system for the period ending in 2013,
another 7 billion euros will be needed for the budget cycle
through 2020 to finish building the system and keep it
operating, said Ingrid Godkin, an official at the commission.  Satellite technology is used for applications including in-
car navigation, time-stamping transactions at banks and powering
telecommunications. Unlike the Global Positioning System,
developed by the U.S. military, Galileo is designed for civil
purposes and aims to end  Europe ’s reliance on GPS.  Galileo “will provide a guaranteed system that won’t be
vulnerable to being shut off for political or military
reasons,” Godkin said.  The launch, first scheduled for today, was delayed by 24
hours for technical reasons, the commission said in a statement.  Successive launches are scheduled to complete the
constellation of 30 satellites by 2019. The additional number of
satellites Galileo provides, combined with GPS, will also
improve the availability of signals in cities and offer better
coverage at high latitudes, particularly in northern Europe,
according to Godkin.  Free Service  The satellites launched today are the program’s first two
to be operational and will test the navigation system in space
and on the ground, said Pal Hvistendahl, a spokesman at the
 European Space Agency , which shared development costs with the
commission. The deployment phase has been funded entirely by the
commission, the executive arm of the 27-nation European Union.  Germany ’s OHB System AG will build the first 14 satellites,
and  France ’s Arianespace made the launchers. The system will
start operating in 2014 and will be available free of charge.  “We are following it closely,” said Kristina Nilsson, a
spokeswoman for TomTom NV, Europe’s biggest maker of portable
navigation devices. “GPS is accurate, but we always track all
new technical developments.”  Unlike GPS, Galileo will also have a commercial, fee-based
service for high-precision, guaranteed signals for use in areas
including mining, surveying and mapping, according to the
commission.  Bad Timing  The commission will finalize a proposal for the 7 billion
euros in funding by the end of the year to be presented to EU
governments for approval, Godkin said.  Governments will probably scrutinize the proposed budget
more carefully than when Galileo was first conceived over a
decade ago because of concern over the economy, said Tomas Valasek, director of foreign policy and defense at the Centre
for European Reform in  London .  Still, the project probably won’t be shut down, and enough
funding will be approved to keep staff employed and provide a
minimal return for the manufacturers, he said.  “They’ve already poured so much money into it,” Valasek
said. “Galileo has already benefited from previously unplanned
allocations from the European Commission budget.”  It may be too early to tell how widely Galileo’s signals
will be made available to the general public.  “We appreciate the Galileo efforts and are looking forward
to seeing the first results,”  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  spokesman  Doug Dawson 
said by e-mail. “We will include Galileo satellites into our
system if it will enhance our systems and the user experience.”  Nokia is working with Russia’s version of GPS,  Glonass ,
which was revived last year after funding collapsed along with
communism in 1991.  To contact the reporters on this story:
