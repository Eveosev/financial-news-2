Electricite de France SA
contradicted the account of former Baden-Wuerttemberg premier
Stefan Mappus over last year’s sale of a 45 percent stake in
 EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK)  to the German state,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing an unidentified company spokesman.  Mappus told EDF it wouldn’t be necessary to consult
parliament on the deal, the newspaper said, adding that the
state leader had justified the exclusion in December by saying
EDF didn’t wish the involvement of legislators.  EDF sold its shares because the offered price was
attractive but otherwise would have kept them, Handelsblatt
said, adding that Mappus had explained the utility had been
seeking an exit from the asset.  To contact the reporter on this story:
