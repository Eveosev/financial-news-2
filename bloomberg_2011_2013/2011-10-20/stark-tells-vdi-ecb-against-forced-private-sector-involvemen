European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said the ECB opposes forcing banks to
participate in a Greek bailout,  Germany ’s VDI website reported,
citing an interview.  “The ECB has warned against a haircut,” Stark was cited
as saying. “We warn against a default and we warn against a
compulsory private-sector involvement.”  Stark also said it’s vital to prevent a spillover into the
banking sector and that  Europe  should learn lessons from the
“lost decade” in Japan where the government was too slow to
restructure its banks, VDI reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
