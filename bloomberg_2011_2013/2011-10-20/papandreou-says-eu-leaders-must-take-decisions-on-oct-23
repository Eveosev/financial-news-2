Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said European Union leaders needed to take
“definitive” decisions on Oct. 23 when they meet on the debt
crisis.  “There are serious doubts as to how much we’ll settle on
decisions on Sunday,” Papandreou told his ministers today in
 Athens , according to an e-mailed transcript of his statements.
“We believe however that these decisions are necessary and
definitive. And we are ringing the alarm bell on any new
delays.”  He repeated his government’s aim to remain in the euro and
to press to alleviate the debt burden for Greeks.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
