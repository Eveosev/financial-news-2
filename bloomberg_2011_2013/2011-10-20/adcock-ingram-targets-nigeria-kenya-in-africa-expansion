Adcock Ingram Holdings Ltd. (AIP)  is
targeting expansion in  Nigeria  and  Kenya  to boost earnings from
 Africa , Kofi Amegashie, head of the drug-maker’s African
operations, said.  “One cannot win in Africa without conquering Nigeria,”
Amegashie said in an e-mailed statement today. “With over 100
million people in Kenya, Uganda and  Tanzania  alone, we must have
significant regional businesses in East, West and North
Africa.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
