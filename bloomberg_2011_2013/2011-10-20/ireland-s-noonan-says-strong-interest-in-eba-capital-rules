Ireland’s Finance Minister  Michael
Noonan  said the government has a  “very strong interest” in
what capital instruments will count as capital reserves by the
European Banking Authority.   He said that while Irish banks should have “headroom” in
terms of capital, it depends on what instruments are acceptable
to European authorities, which are considering bank capital
across the euro area. Speaking to reporters in Dublin today, he
said the EBA tests in July allowed instruments, such as “tax
instruments,” that are not envisaged for inclusion under Basel
III rules.   To contact the reporter on this story:
