Nuri Berruien, chairman of  Libya ’s
National Oil Corp., comments on the death of former leader
 Muammar Qaddafi  and what it means for oil and gas production in
the North African country.  Qaddafi died in his hometown of Sirte today two months
after a NATO-backed uprising forced him from power. Berruien
spoke today by phone from Libya today.  On infrastructure:  “Sirte is in the middle and the  air travel  is a bit
restricted,” he said. “Now that Sirte is liberated, people can
move quickly. People can go to the fields that are in the
west.”  “This will help in getting a lot of fields back into
production as soon as possible,” he said.  On overseas companies returning to Libya:  Companies including Halliburton Co., Schlumberger Ltd. and
Baker Hughes Inc. are considering a return to Libya, he said.
“They are making trips to check on security,” he said. “Very
soon they will be in full force.”  “Technically, you could say Libya is in a state of war,”
he said. “Today, you could say it’s finished. Now we will pay
attention to clean up. We are going to normality. Things will be
safer.”  “More workers will go to certain fields, get back with the
service companies,” he said. “Things are happening better than
everybody’s expectations.”  -Editors: Rachel Graham,  John Buckley   To contact the reporter on this story:
