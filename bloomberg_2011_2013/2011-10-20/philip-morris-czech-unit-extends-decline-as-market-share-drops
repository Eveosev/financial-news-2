Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) â€™s
Czech unit extended declines, headed for its worst day in six
months after the tobacco company said its share of the cigarette
market in the  Czech Republic  shrank.  Philip Morris Czech Republic AS slid 3.5 percent to 11,000
koruna by 1:45 p.m. in Prague. A close at that level would mark
its biggest one-day drop since April 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
