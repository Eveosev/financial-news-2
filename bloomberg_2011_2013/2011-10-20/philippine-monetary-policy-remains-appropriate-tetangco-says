Philippine monetary policy remains
appropriate, central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said in a
speech in  Manila  today before meeting with other board members
to decide on the 4.5 percent benchmark interest rate.  Policy makers will consider the impact of storms on prices,
policy easing overseas and commodities, Tetangco said.   The central bank may decide on rules on non-deliverable
currency forwards this month, he said.  With assistance from Cecilia Yap in Manila.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
