The world economy is facing the
“threat of profound and traumatic disruption,” said  Norman Chan , chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.  “The breakdown of monetary, fiscal and market disciplines
has contributed to the deepness and severity of the latest
crisis in the advanced economies,” Chan said in a  speech posted 
on the de facto central bank’s website.  Chan’s comments echoed those of  Donald Tsang , the top
government leader in Hong Kong, who said he sees a high chance
of a world recession, according to his spokeswoman Suzanne Lee.
Asian stocks fell today amid uncertainty about European bailout-
fund talks and as U.S. companies grew more pessimistic about the
outlook for the world’s largest economy.  The city’s Financial Secretary  John Tsang  said this week
the prospect of weaker growth in the U.S. and the European debt
crisis have already hurt  Hong Kong ’s economy by weakening export
demand.  Morgan Stanley and Daiwa Capital Markets say Hong Kong may
have fallen into a recession in the third quarter, after the
economy shrank 0.5 percent in the April-to-June period from the
previous quarter.  Financial instability will likely slow the Chinese yuan’s
pace of appreciation, Donald Tsang said. His comments were
earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
