France  sold 4.26 billion euros
($5.87 billion) of two- and five-year notes amid concern euro-
area leaders are struggling to find common ground on expanding a
bailout fund for indebted nations in the currency bloc.  The euro-region’s second-largest economy auctioned 2.775
billion euros of 2 percent securities maturing in September
2013, at a yield of 1.31 percent. Investors bid for 2.05 times
the amount on offer, versus a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of
2.66 the previous time the debt was auctioned on Sept. 15.  France sold a further 1.485 billion euros of notes due July
2016 at a yield of 2.31 percent, attracting bids for 3.63 times
the amount offered, compared with 1.54 times at the previous
auction on Sept. 15.  “In particular, the September 2013 looks cheap,” Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income strategist at broker Newedge Group in
London, wrote in a research note today.  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , who chairs
the group of euro-area finance ministers, indicated that leaders
failed to resolve differences at an impromptu meeting in
 Frankfurt  last night ahead of a summit this weekend.  French bonds fell for a third day, with 10-year yields
rising two basis points to 3.22 percent at 10:36 a.m. in London.
The spread or yield difference over similar-maturity bunds
widened to as much as 119 basis points, a euro-era record.  “The widening is explained by worries about the possible
contagion effects from the EMU debt crisis that could undermine
the country’s fiscal position,” Piazza wrote. “Demand at
today’s auction should be supported.”  France also sold 1.215 billion euros of three percent notes
due July 2014, at a yield of 1.58 percent. Investors bought 2.98
times the amount offered, versus 1.85 times at the prior auction
on July 21. An additional 2.105 billion euros of 2 percent notes
maturing July 2015 were sold at a yield of 1.96 percent,
attracting 1.97 times more bids than offers.  A sale of inflation-linked debt maturing 2016, 2027 and
2022 is also scheduled for today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
