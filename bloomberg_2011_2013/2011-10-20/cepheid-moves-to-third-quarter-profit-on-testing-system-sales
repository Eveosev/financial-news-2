Cepheid Inc. (CPHD) , the maker of a rapid
test for a drug-resistant staph infection known as MRSA, said it
had a third-quarter profit of $1.9 million, compared with a
year-earlier loss, on greater use of its diagnostic systems.  Net income was 3 cents a share, from a loss of $1.12
million, or 2 cents, a year earlier, Sunnyvale, California-based
Cepheid said today in a statement. Earnings excluding some items
were 11 cents a share, beating by 4 cents the average estimate
of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Revenue jumped 25 percent to $70.2 million on demand for
its Xpert tests, 11 of which are available in the U.S. and 12
that are available elsewhere. Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is primarily a hospital-acquired
infection that sickens about 90,000 Americans annually, killing
about 15,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.  “Our family of Xpert molecular diagnostic systems and
tests is impacting the treatment decisions of more patients than
ever before,” said John Bishop, Cepheid’s chief executive
officer, in a statement.  Cepheid said the company is terminating a DNA test license
with  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  because the patents under the agreement
aren’t “pertinent to Cepheid’s future business plans.” The
company expects to have a one-time charge of $5.4 million, or 8
cents a share, in the fourth quarter.  The company also raised its full-year revenue forecast to
$269 million to $272 million from $265 million to $270 million
announced on July 21. Earnings excluding certain items are
expected to be 41 cents to 44 cents a share, the company said.  Cepheid rose 1.2 percent in extended trading after gaining
17 cents to $38.55 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
