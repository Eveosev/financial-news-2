Florida  Governor  Rick Scott  was
criticized by a state lawmaker for backing off his promise to
create 700,000 jobs over seven years in addition to those
produced by economic growth.  Scott, a first-term Republican who made the pledge during
his campaign last year, now says he promised the state would add
only 700,000 total. State economists said in  July  that Florida
can expect more than 1 million new jobs over of seven years.  “I just want to confirm that we’re backtracking,”
Representative James Waldman, a Democrat from Coconut Creek,
told Jon Costello, Scott’s legislative affairs director, in a
Tallahassee committee meeting yesterday.  “If what we’re talking about now is only 700,000 jobs, I’m
looking at a 300,000 to 400,000 jobs loss” from what state
economists forecast, he said. “I want to make sure that what
we’re trying to really do is create more new jobs, not the ones
that would have just automatically been created.”  Costello responded that any employment gains from the
recovery would be included in Scott’s 700,000 pledge.  “It’s impossible to isolate” the impact of policies from
normal growth, he said. In the event of another recession, the
governor is still committed to creating 700,000 jobs, he said.  Florida lost more than 900,000 jobs from its employment
peak in March 2007 to its low in December 2009, according to
U.S. Labor Department data, as the U.S. experienced its longest
recession since World War II. It has since gained more than
82,000 posts. The  unemployment rate  was 10.7 percent in August,
1.6 percentage points above the national average.  Determining the Cause  Scott, 58, said he would create the jobs in addition to
natural growth in a January interview in  Washington ,
acknowledging the difficulty of determining the cause.  “It’ll be the 700,000 plus what would be normal,” Scott
said on Jan. 29. “It’ll be hard to figure out which is which.”  He also made his promise in an October 2010 gubernatorial
debate aired on an ABC news affiliate in Tampa and in a July
2010 interview on his campaign bus posted by the Miami Herald
and St. Petersburg Times.  Scott has since reversed course,  telling reporters  earlier
this month that his initial promise was not for an increase on
top of projected growth.  Scott unveiled a  Job Creation and Economic Growth Agenda  on
Oct. 12. The plan calls for streamlining permitting and
decreasing regulation for companies, business-tax cuts, job
retraining for the unemployed, investing in transportation and
emphasizing science, engineering and mathematics in schools.  “Governor Scott remains focused on continuously improving
programs for both  job creation  and for workforce development to
reach 100,000 new jobs this year and 700,000 jobs in seven
years,” a statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
