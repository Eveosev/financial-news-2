Indonesian lawmakers and the
government broke an impasse over a planned financial regulator,
the Jakarta Globe reported today, citing Harry Azhar Aziz,
deputy chairman the parliament’s finance and banking committee.  The Financial Services Supervisory Authority, or OJK as it
is known by its Indonesian-language initials, will begin work
Jan. 1, 2013, the Globe cited Aziz as saying. The authority will
assume the supervisory roles of the country’s central bank and
Bapepam,  Indonesia ’s Capital Market and Financial Institution
Supervisory Agency, Aziz said, according to the report.  The composition of the body may be decided by Oct. 25,
Nusron Wahid, chairman of the parliament’s Financial Services
Authority working committee, said by phone Oct. 5.  Lawmakers and the government failed to agree on the body’s
makeup in July and extended a deadline for parliament and
government to choose the board of commissioners.  The parliament wants two of its members on the financial
supervisory authority’s board, alongside five government
nominees proposed by the president and two former officials from
the  finance ministry  and the central bank. The government’s
proposal is two former finance ministry and central bank members
and seven presidential picks vetted by parliament.  The Jakarta Globe article didn’t say whether those issues
had been resolved.  To contact the reporters on this story:
