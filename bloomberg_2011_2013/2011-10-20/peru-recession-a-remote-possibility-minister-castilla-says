Peru’s economy is unlikely to enter
a recession as  China , its main trading partner, buys more of the
Andean country’s metals and fishmeal, Finance Minister Miguel
Castilla said.  Peru’s economy may expand as much as 6.5 percent this year
as investor confidence improves and the government invests a 1.6
billion soles ($588 million) stimulus package in construction of
infrastructure, Castilla told Lima-based Radioprogramas today.
The plan may add 1 percentage point to annual gross domestic
product, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
