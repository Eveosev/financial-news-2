The  Czech Republic  is unlikely to
adopt the  euro  before 2015 and any “serious” debate about the
move should take place only after the current debt crisis ends,
 E15  reported, citing central bank Governor Miroslav Singer.  The euro area needs to change the way it functions and it’s
unclear what the monetary union will look like after the
sovereign-debt crisis, the newspaper quoted Singer as saying in
an interview. Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas has repeatedly
said his government won’t set a target date for euro adoption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
