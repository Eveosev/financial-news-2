Reports of French-German differences
over leveraging the euro area’s rescue fund are exaggerated, a
European Union official said.  EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  is sticking with a plan to
hold an Oct. 23 summit to stem the euro-area debt crisis, the
official told reporters today in Brussels on the condition of
anonomity.  Newspaper Die Welt reported today that the German
government doesn’t rule out a delay of the leaders’ meeting as a
result of divisions over leveraging the bailout fund, the
European Financial Stability Facility. The German paper cited
unidentified people close to the country’s governing coalition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
