Treasuries erased a decline as Asian
stocks fell after  France  and Germany failed to resolve a dispute
over how to end the region’s debt crisis.  U.S. 10-year yields were about half a percentage point away
from a record low as European policy makers disagreed over how
heavily they can rely on their central bank to support a bailout
fund for countries. The extra yield investors demand to buy 10-
year Treasuries instead of two-year notes has narrowed to 1.88
percentage points from this year’s high of 2.91 percentage
points in February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is still a flight to quality, very clearly,” said
Zeal Yin, a  money manager  at Taipei-based Shin Kong Life
Insurance Co.,  Taiwan ’s second-largest life insurer with the
equivalent of $39.7 billion in assets. “The problem is not
solved” in  Europe , he said.  Benchmark 10-year rates declined one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.15 percent as of 6:34 a.m. in  Tokyo ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.125 percent
security due in August 2021 changed hands at 99 25/32.  The record low was 1.67 percent on Sept. 23.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares slid 1.9 percent,
erasing a gain from yesterday.  Shin Kong Life increased its Treasury holdings this month,
favoring 10- and 30-year maturities, Yin said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
