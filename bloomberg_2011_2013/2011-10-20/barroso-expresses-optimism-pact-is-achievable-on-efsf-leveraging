European Commission PresidentJose Barroso expressed optimism that euro-area leaders will reach
agreement this weekend on leveraging their temporary rescue fund
to help fight the debt crisis.  Government heads from the 17-nation euro area are due to
meet in Brussels on Oct. 23 to seek ways to enhance the
effectiveness of the 440 billion-euro ($604 billion) European
Financial Stability Facility. The AAA rated EFSF was established
last year to sell bonds to finance rescue loans for distressed
euro nations.  The leaders decided earlier this year to expand the role of
the EFSF by giving it the power to buy sovereign bonds on the
primary and secondary markets, offer credit lines to governments
and recapitalize banks. As the Greece-triggered debt crisis has
continued to spread, the focus has shifted to how to get the
most out of the EFSF’s resources.  “We have been proposing the leveraging of the EFSF,”
Barroso told a conference today in Brussels. “I hope this will
be agreed on Sunday. I am encouraged by the work going on. I
think a very positive outcome on Sunday is possible provided
there is political will and a sense of compromise from all
participants.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
