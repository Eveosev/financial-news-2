Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  briefed Senate Democrats today about the European debt
crisis and said it could have an impact on the  U.S. economy ,
said Senators  Dick Durbin  and  Barbara Boxer .  “He gave us an analysis of what’s going on in Europe, and
there are some critical decisions being made over there that
could have an impact on the United States,” Durbin, of
Illinois, said in Washington.  European stocks declined the most in two weeks amid concern
the euro area’s leaders are far from agreeing on a plan to end
the region’s debt crisis. European governments may unleash as
much as 940 billion euros ($1.3 trillion) to fight the debt
crisis by combining the temporary and planned permanent rescue
funds, two people familiar with the discussions said.  Bernanke told senators that the crisis is “worrisome and
it impacts our economy,” Durbin told reporters. “He has urged
the leaders of  Europe  to take it very seriously, but he’s not
alone. Other countries from around the world have joined him in
that chorus. This is not confined to any specific countries in
Europe or the euro zone. It really has a reach beyond that.”  Bernanke was asked to a luncheon held by Senate Democrats
on Thursdays.  “We invited him to be a professor,” Boxer, of California,
said. “We invited him to come to us and teach us about this
crisis.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
