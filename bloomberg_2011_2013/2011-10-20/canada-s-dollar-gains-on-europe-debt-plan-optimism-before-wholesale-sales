Canada’s dollar weakened against its
U.S. counterpart after a report that  Germany  would seek to
postpone this weekend’s summit on  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis
curtailed demand for riskier assets.  Canada’s currency declined as stocks and crude oil, the
nation’s largest export, traded lower. The loonie, as the
currency is nicknamed, rose earlier amid speculation European
leaders will agree to increase the effectiveness of the bailout
fund for the region’s crisis. It remained higher versus 13 of
its 16 most-traded peers.  “The main action that has caused the market to turn around
were the headlines that the summit this weekend may actually be
postponed and that soured things,” said  George Davis , chief
technical analyst for fixed income and currency strategy in
Toronto at Royal Bank of  Canada . “The equity market has also
come under some selling pressure that combined with lower
commodity prices have pushed risk aversion levels higher and
that is positive for the  U.S. dollar .”  Canada’s currency fell 0.2 percent to C$1.0220 per U.S.
dollar at 11:33 a.m. in Toronto, after rising as much as 0.7
percent. One Canadian dollar buys 97.94 U.S. cents.  “Europe is completely driving the bus right now,” said
 Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign exchange at National
Bank of Canada in Toronto, in a telephone interview.  Bond Trade  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.3 percent after
gaining as much 0.3 percent. Crude oil futures lost 1 percent to
$85.20 a barrel in New York after gaining has much as 1.1
percent.  Government bonds  rose, with the 10-year note’s yield down
three basis points to 2.30 percent. The price of the 3.25
percent security maturing in June 2021 rose 24 cents to
C$108.10.  Canada’s government bonds have returned 6.8 percent this
year, compared with 6.2 percent for all of 2010, according to a
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  Wholesale sales rose 0.2 percent in August to C$48.4
billion ($47.5 billion), Ottawa-based  Statistics Canada  said.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a 0.5 percent
increase, the median of 15 estimates.  The gain reflected higher prices for imported goods.
Excluding the impact of prices, wholesalers recorded their
biggest decline since May 2010.  Economic data reports are “overwhelmed by the momentum and
influence that’s created by these headline bombs that keep
hitting the market on a daily basis,” said National Bank’s
Spitz. “There’s tremendous sensitivity because it’s
unprecedented event risk.”  The currency will trade at about C$1.02 by year-end before
strengthening to 98 cents by the end of next year, according to
the median of 34 analyst and economist forecasts compiled by
Bloomberg News. The median forecast a month earlier called for
the loonie to end this year and 2012 at 98 cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
