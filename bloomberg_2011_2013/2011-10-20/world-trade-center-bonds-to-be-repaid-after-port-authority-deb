Investors in a planned $1.3 billion
bond deal to help rebuild the World Trade Center will be paid
only after the  Port Authority  of New York and  New Jersey , which
oversees the project, pays off other debts in an agreement to
let the sale proceed.  The New York Liberty Development Corp., created to help
finance construction of the Lower Manhattan complex, plans to
sell the tax-exempt revenue bonds as soon as next month. The
securities to finance 4 World Trade Center may yield about 5.25
percent, according to a resolution that the authority’s board
approved today.  While rent from the Port Authority will help repay the
corporation’s so-called Liberty bonds, the agency must first pay
principal and interest on its own debt, according to the
resolution.  Holders of $1.2 billion in Port Authority bonds said this
year that their contracts keep the agency from paying other
bondholders before them.  Liberty, an arm of the state-created Empire State
Development Corp., in April delayed a $900 million bond deal for
the tower, citing market considerations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
