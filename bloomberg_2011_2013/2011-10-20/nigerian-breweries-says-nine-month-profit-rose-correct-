Nigerian Breweries Plc (NB) , the
country’s biggest beer-maker by market value, said nine-month
profit through September climbed 18 percent as sales increased.  Net income rose to 24.83 billion naira ($159 million),
compared with 21.14 billion naira a year earlier, the Lagos-
based company said in a statement published today on the website
of the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Sales jumped 22 percent to
159.96 billion naira.  The Heineken NV unit, which acquired two brewing companies,
Sona Systems Associates Business Management Ltd. and Life
Breweries Co. Ltd. last month, said the “overall impact of the
consolidation will be reflected” in its full-year result. The
company expects “overall positive trend recorded so far to
continue in the last quarter of the year.”  Nigerian Breweries advanced 48 kobo, or 0.6 percent, to
88.53 naira at the close of trading in Lagos. The stock has
gained 15 percent this year compared with the 19 percent decline
of the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
