Lenny Dykstra, a former player for
 Major League Baseball ’s New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies,
was convicted of three counts of grand theft auto and filing a
false financial statement after declining to challenge the
charges.  Dykstra, 48, pleaded “no contest” in court yesterday and
faces as long as four years in state prison, according to a
statement on the website of the  Los Angeles  County District
Attorney. He was released pending his sentencing on Jan. 20,
according to the statement.  Dykstra was charged in June for allegedly trying to lease
cars using phony business cards and credit information and with
drug possession. The previous month, Dykstra had been charged by
federal prosecutors of looting his mansion in Thousand Oaks,
 California , and selling items belonging to the bankruptcy
estate.  Ted Flier, Dykstra’s lawyer, didn’t immediately return a
call to his office seeking comment on the plea after regular
business hours yesterday.  The case is People v. Dykstra, PA070678, California
Superior Court (Los Angeles County).  To contact the reporter on this story:
