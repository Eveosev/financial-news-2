Nigeria ’s planned government
spending cuts will be difficult to achieve initially because it
will require a reduction in wages, Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said.  While debt levels are “relatively good” at 20 percent of
gross domestic product, the government aims to lower that, the
minister said at a conference hosted by the Economist magazine
in the capital, Abuja, today.  Okonjo-Iweala, who took office on Aug. 17, has vowed to cut
government wages to reduce recurrent spending, which accounted
for about 74 percent of this year’s budget, to 70 percent within
four years. The government of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer may
lift spending by 7 percent to 4.8 trillion naira ($30 billion)
in the 2012 budget, according to the Budget Office.  Lowering spending is “going to be very hard in the short-
term because you are talking about people and salaries,”
Okonjo-Iweala said. “This administration is determined to move
this economy forward, but it’s going to be a tough fight.”  Nigeria is facing fiscal liquidity pressures as oil prices
drop and spending increases, central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi
said yesterday. Crude oil has slumped 22 percent in  New York  in
the past six months, reaching as low as $85.27 a barrel today.  “We see a lot of volatility in the horizon” because of
“uncertainties in the global environment,” Okonjo-Iweala said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
