OAO Russian Railways will issue a
600 million-euro tender later this year for work on a new high-
speed line between Moscow and  St. Petersburg  thatâ€™s scheduled to
open in time for the 2018 soccer  World Cup , it said today.  The tender will include the installation of electricty
supplies and the rerouting of roads and will be followed next
August by a request for bids to build the line, project chief
Denis Muratov said at a press briefing in  London .  Russian Railways may issue so-called infrastructure bonds
to help fund the project, Muratov said. The company is also
planning an international roadshow next month to encourage
interest from the global financial community.  To contact the reporter on this story:
