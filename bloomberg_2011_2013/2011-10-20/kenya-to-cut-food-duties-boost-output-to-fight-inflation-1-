Kenya ,  East Africa ’s biggest economy,
plans to slash duties on imported staple food and to subsidize
fertilizers for farmers in a bid to fight inflation, President
Mwai Kibaki said.  “I wish to assure Kenyans that the government is taking
both long and short-term interventions to make life affordable,
especially to the low income group in our country,” Kibaki said
today in a speech marking Heroes Day.  Inflation accelerated to 17.3 percent last month, more than
triple the government’s 5 percent target. Kenya’s central bank
on Oct. 5 raised its benchmark  interest rate  by 4 percentage
points to a record 11 percent to bolster the shilling, one of
the world’s worst-performing currency this year.  The government will give farmers 700 million shillings ($7
million) to grow drought-resistant crops such as sorghum, millet
and cassava and will invest 4.8 billion shillings to ensure
availability of fertilizer, Kibaki said.  “We will also be establishing a permanent fertilizer and
seed fund to address concerns of farmers in the long term,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
