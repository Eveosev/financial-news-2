Coffee exports from  Uganda ,  Africa ’s
second-biggest producer of the commodity, may climb 6.4 percent
this month from a year earlier on a bigger harvest, the
country’s Coffee Development Authority said.  Shipments in October may rise to 200,000 60-kilogram (132-
pound) bags, from 188,012 bags, the agency said by e-mail
yesterday from the capital, Kampala. Exports may be 41 percent
lower than the 340,378 bags shipped in September after
harvesting was completed in the southern and southwestern
regions, the authority said.  The country’s coffee exports in the 12 months from Oct. 1
through September next year may rise to 3.3 million bags, from
3.15 million bags in 2010-11, because of a bigger crop,
according to the authority, which didn’t provide production
forecasts. Exports in 2010-11 were worth $448.89 million, the
authority said.  Uganda ranks behind Ethiopia as the continent’s largest
exporter of coffee, according to the London-based International
Coffee Organization. Robusta beans, used in espressos and
instant drinks, account for about 85 percent of the nation’s
annual production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
