What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade after a government report
today showed that there were no additional sales to  China  in the
week ended Oct. 13 above the quantities previously announced,
 Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des
Moines ,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said export
sales of the oilseed last week dropped 12 percent from a week
earlier and fell 71 percent from a year earlier, according to
Roose.  Soybean-oil  futures are expected to open 0.05 cent to 0.1
cent lower, and soybean-meal futures may open down 30 cents to
50 cents for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 1 cent a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as more of the grain may be used in livestock
feed, Roose said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
