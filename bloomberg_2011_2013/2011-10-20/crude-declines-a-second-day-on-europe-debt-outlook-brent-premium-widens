Oil dropped a second day as splits
between Germany and  France  threatened to derail European rescue
measures, undermining the outlook for fuel consumption.  December futures fell as much as 1.1 percent, extending
yesterday’s 2.5 percent slump. U.S. fuel use declined 2.2
percent to the lowest since May last week while crude stockpiles
shrank, the Energy Department said yesterday. Divisions emerged
over  Europe ’s rescue strategy as finance ministers prepared to
meet this weekend. The  Federal Reserve  said yesterday that U.S.
companies reported more doubt about the strength of the recovery.  “Global confidence in the political will and ability of
policymakers has been severely undermined,” Amrita Sen, an 
analyst at Barclays Plc in London, said in a report today.
Still, “even in the worst-case scenario, the downside to  oil
prices  is unlikely to be anything as severe as during the 
2008-to-2009 cycle.”  Crude oil for December delivery, the most actively traded
contract on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , slipped as much 98
cents to $85.27 a barrel and was at $85.94 as of 8:51 a.m. in
London. The contract yesterday fell $2.24 to $86.29, the lowest
since Oct. 13. November futures, expiring today, were at $85.79.  Brent oil for December settlement was at $108.34 a barrel,
down 5 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
That pushed the spread between the December Brent and Nymex
crude contracts to $22.53, compared with $22.10 yesterday and a
record high of $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Fuel Demand  U.S. fuel use fell 2.2 percent to 18.3 million barrels a
day last week, the least since May, the Energy Department said
yesterday in its weekly report. Crude stockpiles dropped 4.73
million barrels to 332.9 million. They were forecast to rise 2
million, according to the median of 13 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline inventories declined 3.32 million to 206.3
million. They were forecast to slide 1.5 million, according to
the survey. Supplies of distillate fuel, a category that
includes oil and diesel, decreased 4.27 million barrels compared
with an estimate for a 1.5 million decline.  Oil prices have dropped 6.2 percent in  New York  this year
amid concern that the faltering U.S. economy and Europe’s debt
crisis will curb raw material demand. Luxembourg Prime Minister
 Jean-Claude Juncker , who chairs a group of euro-area finance
ministers, indicated an impromptu meeting of European leaders in
Frankfurt last night failed to resolve differences over the
region’s rescue plan.  “The market rejected the sizable draw in inventories and
decided to focus on what’s happening with Germany and France,”
said  Jonathan Barratt , a managing director of Commodity Broking
Services Pty in Sydney. “The disagreement put the cat among the
pigeons. Economic growth will be hurt even further because
there’s no resolution out of Europe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
