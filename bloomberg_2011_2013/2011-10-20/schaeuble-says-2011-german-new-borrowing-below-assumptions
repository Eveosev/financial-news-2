German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said federal new borrowing this year will be
“clearly” below previous assumptions, coming in at below 30

governement economic forecasts in Berlin, Schaeuble said he may
not be able to maintain the pace of reducing net credit amid
slower economic growth next year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
