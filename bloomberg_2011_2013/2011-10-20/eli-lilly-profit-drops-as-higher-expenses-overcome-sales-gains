Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) , whose top-selling
schizophrenia drug Zyprexa loses U.S. patent protection this
month, said third-quarter profit dropped 5 percent on higher
marketing expenses.  Net income fell to $1.24 billion, or $1.11 a share, from
$1.3 billion, or $1.18, a year earlier, the Indianapolis-based
company said today in a statement. Earnings excluding one-time
items were $1.13 a share, beating the $1.12 average estimate of
14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Lilly is aiming to overcome the loss of patents on Zyprexa,
on Oct. 23, and other medicines without a major merger by
investing in research. The drugmaker has treatments for
Alzheimer’s, diabetes and cancer in final-stage trials. As Lilly
awaits these results, the company is focusing effort on growth
areas such as emerging markets and animal health.  “It looks all in all like a pretty clean quarter, with no
big surprises,” said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar
Inc. in  Chicago , in a phone interview. “It is going to be tough
going forward,” because of the Zyprexa patent expiration.  Revenue increased 9 percent to $6.15 billion, higher than
the $6.05 billion estimated by analysts. Sales of Humalog for
diabetes rose 20 percent to $593.2 million, while sales of
Cymbalta rose 29 percent to $1.07 billion.  Full-Year Forecast  Lilly raised the lower end its forecast for full-year
adjusted earnings to $4.30 a share from $4.25 a share. The
company also narrowed its guidance for full-year earnings to
$3.89 to $3.94 a share from $3.85 to $3.95 a share.  Lilly shares dropped less than 1 percent to $38.61 at the
close of trading in  New York . They have gained 10 percent this
year.  The drugmaker said it expects “rapid and severe erosion”
of Zyprexa sales when the patent expires later this month. It
still projects 2011 revenue growth in the mid-single digits. The
impact of the U.S. health-care overhaul will lower 2011 revenue
by $400 million to $500 million, the company said, matching
previous estimates.  “The real key is about the pipeline and much of Lilly’s
pipeline is yet to come,” said  Tony Butler , an analyst at
 Barclays Capital  in New York, in a telephone interview before
the earnings. Final-stage trial results for Lilly’s Alzheimer’s
drug solanezumab are expected next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
