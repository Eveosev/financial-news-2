Petropavlovsk Plc (POG) , a Russian gold
mining company, said third-quarter output rose 65 percent after
production increased at its Pioneer site.  So-called attributable gold output climbed to 228,100
ounces from 138,300 ounces a year earlier, the London-based
company said today in a statement. Petropavlovsk reaffirmed its
600,000-ounce full-year forecast.  Gold producers are seeking to expand to meet rising demand
that has driven up prices as investors seek a haven from
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt woes and weakening currencies. Gold for
immediate delivery averaged a record $1,706.38 an ounce in the
third quarter, compared with $1,227.73 a year earlier.  “Good performance at Pioneer, Malomir and Pokrovskiy
continues through October with all mines on schedule, and
accordingly the Group is confident of meeting its full-year
production target of 600,000 ounces,” the company said in the
statement.  Production in the first 9 months of the year was 447,200
ounces, Petropavlovsk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
