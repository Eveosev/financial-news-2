China ’s Citic Group, the biggest
shareholder in  Macarthur Coal Ltd. (MCC) , agreed to accept  Peabody
Energy Corp. (BTU)  and  ArcelorMittal (MT) ’s takeover offer for the
Australian producer.  Citic’s acceptance of the A$16 ($16.37) a share offer will
take Peabody and ArcelorMittal’s stake in the Brisbane-based
company to more than 49 percent, the two companies said today in
a statement. They will raise the bid to A$16.25 a share should
they gain a stake of at least 90 percent, Citic said in a
separate statement.  The higher bid values Macarthur at about A$4.9 billion and
has been extended to Nov. 11. Buying Macarthur will give Peabody
and ArcelorMittal ownership of steelmaking coal mines in
Queensland, the world’s biggest exporter of the fuel.  “We are pleased that these shareholders have decided to
accept our offer,” Gregory Boyce, Peabody chief executive
officer said in the statement. “We look forward to
transitioning to the next phase of Macarthur’s future.”  Macarthur shares closed yesterday in Sydney at A$16.08.  To contact the reporter on this story:
