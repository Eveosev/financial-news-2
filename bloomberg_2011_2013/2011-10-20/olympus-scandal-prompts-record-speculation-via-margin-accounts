(Corrects date of Woodford’s dismissal in the second
paragraph in a story published on Oct. 21.)  A record number of shares in  Olympus
Corp. (7733)  are being bought and sold through Japanese margin-trading
accounts as investors seek to capitalize on volatility amid a
scandal over payments to advisers.  The number of Olympus shares being held through margin
accounts has surged to the highest since at least 1997,
according to data from Japan Securities Finance Co., a provider
of loans and lending services. Olympus has lost half of its
market value since Michael C. Woodford was fired as president on
Oct. 14 after calling for a probe of $687 million in payments
during a $2 billion takeover in 2008.  “Investors see this as a rare opportunity to gain big
profits in the short term,” said  Kenichi Hirano , a general
manager and strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo.
“The volatility of Olympus is rising and the share price is
likely to swing wildly in both directions.”  The Tokyo-based maker of endoscopes and cameras dropped 6.8
percent to 1,231 yen at close of Tokyo trading, extending a six
day slide that has erased more than $4.4 billion from the
company’s market value. The benchmark  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
was little changed today.  PwC Audit  A PricewaterhouseCoopers audit commissioned by Woodford
before he was fired said the company may face regulatory and
legal scrutiny over payments made to advisers in the 2008
purchase of Gyrus Group Plc. Olympus, which confirmed the
magnitude of the payments, said the report was misleading and
speculative.  Holdings in margin accounts that profit when the stock
gains, known as long positions, surged as much as 94 times to
8.68 million shares since Oct. 13, the Japan Securities Finance
data show. Short positions, which bet on declines, soared 10
times in the period.  The average ratio of long positions to short positions over
the past five days jumped to 1.3, the highest since December
2010, the data show. That compares with an average ratio for the
three months to Oct. 13 of 0.1 times, meaning 10 times as many
shares were being sold short as long.  “For speculators who see the market as just a place to
play money games, Olympus provides a great opportunity for huge
profits,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600
million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “They
are playing it the same way they did with Tokyo Electric Power
Co., which plummeted after the devastating earthquake and
nuclear power accidents.”  Long positions over shares of Tepco, as the utility at the
center of the worst nuclear crisis in 25 years is known, surged
as much as 20 times and short positions soared 18 times in the
five business days following the March 11 temblor. Tepco’s share
price has fallen 86 percent since the day before the disaster,
while its 30-day historical implied volatility is still almost
10 times higher than it was on March 10. Tepco shares jumped 36
percent yesterday, the most since the earthquake, and retreated
9.9 percent today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
