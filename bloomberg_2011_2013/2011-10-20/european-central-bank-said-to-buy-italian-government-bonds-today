The  European Central Bank  bought
Italian government debt today, according to two people with
direct knowledge of the transactions.  The Frankfurt-based central bank purchased a small amount
of the securities, said one of the people, who asked not to be
identified because the transactions are confidential. An ECB
spokeswoman declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
