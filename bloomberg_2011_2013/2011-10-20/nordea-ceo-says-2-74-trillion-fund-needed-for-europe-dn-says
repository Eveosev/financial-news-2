A rescue fund of 2 trillion euros
($2.74 trillion) to support banks is what is needed to restore
confidence in European credit markets, Dagens Naeringsliv
reported, citing  Nordea Bank AB (NDA) ’s Chief Executive Officer
Christian Clausen.  Such a ‘strong message’ would lower interest rates to a
level that is manageable for Italy, Spain and  France , the
executive told the Oslo-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
