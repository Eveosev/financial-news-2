Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor
Orban ’s Cabinet approved a plan to overhaul the judiciary, the
government spokesman’s office said, which may open the way for
the ouster of  Supreme Court  Chief Justice Andras Baka.  The reorganization of the judiciary will see the creation
of the National Judicial Agency, whose head will be elected by
lawmakers for a nine-year mandate, according to an e-mailed
statement today. This person will oversee the judiciary,
according to the statement. The “Kuria” will take the place of
the Supreme Court as the country’s top court.  The changes are part of the government’s overhaul of the
country’s institutions after Parliament, where ruling party
lawmakers have a constitutional majority, approved a new
Constitution from next year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
