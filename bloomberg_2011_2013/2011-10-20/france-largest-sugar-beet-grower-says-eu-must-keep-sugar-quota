France , the world’s largest sugar-
beet grower, called for the European Union to maintain limits on
sugar production that the bloc has proposed abolishing in 2015.  French Agriculture Minister Bruno Le Maire and Hungarian
Minister of Rural Development Sandor Fazekas agreed at a meeting
today that the EU must keep mechanisms to control production in
the face of “growing volatility” of agricultural prices, the
French Agriculture Ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s regulatory
arm, on Oct. 12 proposed to end limits on domestic sugar output
as part of the EU’s future agriculture policy. The EU now caps
how much sugar can be produced for its domestic market, and sets
a minimum price that refiners must pay farmers for beets.  “The existing regulatory mechanisms for production
volumes, such as planting rights for the wine sector or sugar
quotas, having proven their effectiveness, should be
maintained,” the ministry said in a statement that it said
reflects a joint position by France and  Hungary .  The countries also called for a “stronger” Common
Agricultural Policy, with a budget that is maintained “at
least” at the existing level, according to the statement.  France’s sugar production is forecast to climb to 4.73
million metric tons in the year through September 2012 from
4.26 million tons the previous year, the EU estimates. France is
the largest sugar beet grower, according to the  United Nations ’
 Food and Agriculture Organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
