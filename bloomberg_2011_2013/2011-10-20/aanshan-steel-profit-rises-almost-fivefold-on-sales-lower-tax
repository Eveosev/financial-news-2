Maanshan Iron and Steel Co., the
second-biggest Hong Kong-traded steelmaker, said third-quarter
profit surged almost fivefold as production rose and taxes fell.  Net income climbed to 14.6 million yuan ($2.3 million), or
0.19 yuan a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from 3.04
million yuan, or 0.04 yuan a share, a year ago, according to a
 statement  on the  Shanghai Stock Exchange  today. Sales increased
36 percent to 23.2 billion yuan.  China ’s steel prices have fallen since reaching 4,839 yuan
a metric ton on Aug. 16, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co., amid concerns of a slowing global
economy and moderating construction demand. The prices of hot-
rolled coil, a benchmark product, fell 2.8 percent, the biggest
drop since Dec. 2009, today to 4,236 yuan.  Maanshan advanced 0.5 percent to close at HK$1.92 today in
Hong Kong trading, compared with a 1.8 percent drop in the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index . The stock has shed 60 percent in the
past year.  The company said it raised production of crude steel by 8.4
percent to 4.41 million tons and output of steel products by 13
percent to 4.3 million tons in the third quarter from a year ago.  While steel production capacity remained at a “high
level,” demand was “weak” and overall steel prices were “low
and fluctuating” in the third quarter, the company said. It
will continue to cut costs and improve efficiency, according to
the statement.  Contract iron ore prices the Chinese steelmakers paid Vale
SA, Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd. stayed near record
levels in the quarter.  Lower steel prices may force mills to cut production in the
fourth quarter, trimming consumption for the raw material iron
ore, analysts including Custeel.com’s Hu Yanping has said.  Maanshan’s short term borrowings at the end of September
were 6.8 billion yuan, almost 600 percent higher than at the end
of December, due to increases in loans for working capital
resulting from higher steel product sales and commercial trading,
according a statement made to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.  Taxes and surcharges in the third quarter dropped to 52
million yuan from 73 million yuan a year ago, the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
