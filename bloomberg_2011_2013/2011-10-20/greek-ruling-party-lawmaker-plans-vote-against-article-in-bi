Greek ruling party lawmaker Louka Katseli said that she plans to vote against an article in the
government’s austerity bill, breaking ranks with Prime Minister
 George Papandreou ’s government.  “I voted in support of the legislation in the in-principle
vote” that took place yesterday, Katseli, a former labor
minister in Papandreou’s government, said in parliament in
Athens today. “I cannot vote for article 37 unless it is
changed.”  Article 37, which has drawn particular fire from labor
unions as well as members of the ruling Pasok party, suspends
the power of unions to impose wages and work rules through
collective labor agreements.  Greek lawmakers will vote later today on the second
austerity bill in four months as the government seeks to secure
continued financing from its European Union partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
