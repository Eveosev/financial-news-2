The  Bank of England  said bank
funding markets were “very difficult” last month though the
strains hadn’t yet affected borrowing costs for companies and
households.  “In recent discussions, some major U.K. lenders reported
that higher wholesale bank funding costs were starting to feed
through to their internal transfer prices,” the bank said,
citing a survey of lenders in its Trends in Lending report
published today. “As yet, the effect on loan pricing for
corporates and households was muted.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
