Almost all U.S. citizens, including
children, exceed the dietary guidelines for salt, putting them
at risk for hypertension and heart disease, according to a
report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  About half of Americans -- those with high  blood pressure 
or other risk factors -- should consume less than 1,500
milligrams of sodium, and 99 percent of these people don’t,
according to a report from the Atlanta-based CDC in the
 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report . The other 52 percent
should consume less than 2,300 mg, the recommended daily limit,
and 88 percent exceeded that.  Table salt is about 40 percent sodium, which is known to
raise blood pressure, according to the  American Heart
Association . Three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt contains about
1,800 mg of sodium, or more than the recommended amount for half
the population. About 75 percent of sodium is added to
commercial foods during processing or in restaurant preparation,
the authors wrote.  “Because usual sodium intake for nearly all U.S. residents
exceeds 2010 dietary guidelines, increased efforts involving the
public and private sectors -- voluntary reductions in processed
and restaurant food -- will be needed,” the authors wrote.  The data was obtained using  a survey  of the U.S.’s non-
institutionalized population from 2005 through 2008. About
18,823 people over the age of two were interviewed and examined.
The scientists measured the blood pressure of participants,
tested blood and urine, and asked what they ate in the last 24
hours. Three to 10 days later, they were again asked what they
ate that day.  After certain exclusions, researchers analyzed a sample of
9,468 participants, including 5,188 patients age 2 to 17 and
4,280 age 18 and older.  People with the lowered recommended intake were mostly over
51 years old, black or had high blood pressure, diabetes, or
chronic  kidney disease , the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
