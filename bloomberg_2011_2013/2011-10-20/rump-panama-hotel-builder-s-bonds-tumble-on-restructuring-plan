Newland International Properties
Corp. bonds issued to finance construction of  Panama ’s Trump
Ocean Club tumbled a day after the property’s chief financial
officer said the bonds may be restructured before a Nov. 15
payment.  Yields on the bonds that mature in 2014 rose 12 percentage
points to 33 percent, a record high, according to data from
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The securities’ price fell 17.95 cents to
56.6 cents on the dollar.  Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the bonds today to
Caa3, nine levels below investment grade, from B3, citing the
restructuring plan, which it said “would constitute a
distressed exchange under Moody’s definition of default.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
