Facebook Inc., the world’s largest
social network, and the U.S. Labor Department will start an
effort today aimed at helping the unemployed find jobs.  The initiative, called the Social Jobs Partnership, will
feature a Facebook page with resources for job seekers and
employers at www.facebook.com/socialjobs. The company also will
study how job seekers and recruiters use social media, and
develop a way for job postings to be delivered free using
Facebook.  “Facebook is about connecting people so that they can
share what’s important to them, and that is the driving force
behind the Social Jobs Partnership,” Marne Levine, vice
president of global public policy at Facebook, said in a
statement distributed ahead of the announcement in  Washington .  The Labor Department partnership with Facebook seeks to
help lower U.S. unemployment, which has remained at 9 percent or
higher since April. President  Barack Obama ’s administration has
been struggling to create jobs and cut unemployment.  “By leveraging the power of the social web, this
initiative will provide immediate, meaningful and ready-to-use
information for job seekers and employers, and a modern platform
to better connect them,” Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis said in
the statement.  Facebook last month said the social network would work with
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s biggest business
lobbying group, and the  National Federation of Independent
Business  to help small companies expand and advertise more
effectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
