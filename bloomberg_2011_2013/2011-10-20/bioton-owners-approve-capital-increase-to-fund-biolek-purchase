Shareholders of  Bioton SA (BIO) , Poland’s
largest biotechnology company, yesterday approved a capital
increase of as much as 319.1 million zloty ($100.5 million)
through the issue of up to 1.6 billion warrants for Bioton
shares to Troqueera Enterprises Limited, the company said in a
disclosure statement.  The capital increase will be used to finance acquisition
from Troqueera of a 50.1 percent stake in Biolek Sp. z o.o., a
maker of veterinary and pharmaceutical products, Bioton’s
management board said in a statement. The main reason for the
acquisition is a $1.2 billion contract held by Biolek to
distribute veterinary products in  China  from 2012 to 2021, the
board said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
