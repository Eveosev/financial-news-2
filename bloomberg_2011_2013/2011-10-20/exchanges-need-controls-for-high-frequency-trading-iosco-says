Trading venues should take steps to
curb “risks posed to the financial system” by high-frequency
and algorithmic trading, the  International Organization of
Securities Commissions  said.  Exchanges and other venues should be able to impose
emergency stops to automatic trading when market volatility
surpasses a certain threshold, IOSCO said in a statement on its
website today.  “All order flow of trading participants, irrespective of
whether they are direct venue members or otherwise, must be
subject to appropriate controls,” IOSCO said.  Such measures would “take speed out of the market to be
able to determine if orders which could move the market
dramatically are legitimate (e.g. no error trades) ensuring that
the price formation process is orderly,” IOSCO said.  Madrid-based IOSCO brings together national market
regulators from more than 100 countries to coordinate rules and
share information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
