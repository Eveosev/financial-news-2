Oil climbed in  New York , trimming
the first weekly decline in three, as investors bet signs of an
economic recovery in the U.S. and  Europe ’s steps to contain in
its debt crisis mean demand for raw materials may increase.  Futures gained as much as 0.5 percent after a U.S.
manufacturing gauge unexpectedly expanded and European
governments discussed deploying $1.3 trillion in funds to tackle
the sovereign debt crisis. The death of former Libyan leader
 Muammar Qaddafi  will expedite efforts to revive crude output to
normal levels, the state-run National Oil Corp. said.  Crude oil for December delivery rose as much as 43 cents to
$86.50 a barrel and was at $86.36, in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 9:41 a.m. Sydney time. The
contract yesterday fell 0.3 percent to $86.07. Front-month
futures are down 0.5 percent this week and 5.5 percent lower
this year.  Brent oil for December settlement advanced $1.37, or 1.3
percent, to $109.76 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract closed at a
premium of $23.69 to New York crude, compared with a record of
$27.88 on Oct. 14.  U.S. crude inventories fell to their five-year seasonal
average for the first time in more than a year, signaling the
end of a glut in the world’s largest oil consumer. Stockpiles
dropped to 332.9 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 14, the
Energy Department said in an Oct. 19 report, just above a five-
year rolling mean of 332.2 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
