Indonesia ’s foreign and domestic
investments increased last quarter as companies from Singapore
and the U.S. boosted spending.  Investment  rose 15.3 percent to 65.4 trillion rupiah ($7.3
billion) in the three months ended Sept. 30 from a year earlier,
Azhar Lubis, deputy chairman of the Investment Coordinating
Board, said in Jakarta today. The country attracted 181 trillion
rupiah in the nine months through September, a 21 percent
increase from a year earlier, he said.  President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono aims to expand  Southeast
Asia ’s largest economy at an annual average rate of 6.6 percent
through the remainder of his term ending in 2014 by creating
jobs and developing the country’s infrastructure. The central
bank this month lowered its benchmark  interest rate  for the
first time in more than two years to spur domestic demand as the
global recovery weakens.  “Amid a volatile global economy, full of uncertainties in
the U.S. and  Europe , we still manage to post growth in
investment realization,” Lubis said. “We are optimistic we can
reach total investments of 240 trillion rupiah this year and
it’s possible we can reach more than that.”  The investment board expects total investments to grow 15
percent in 2012, he said.  Domestic investment rose 14.5 percent to 19 trillion rupiah
during the July to September period, led by foodstuff and
plantation projects and spending on electricity, gas and water,
the agency said. Foreign direct investment climbed 15.7 percent
to 46.4 trillion rupiah in the same period, aided by
transportation, telecommunication and mining.  Singapore  was the biggest contributor to third-quarter
foreign investment, accounting for $1.3 billion. Investment from
the U.S. totaled $0.5 billion.  The $707 billion economy is forecast to expand 6.6 percent
this year, with growth easing to 6.5 percent in 2012, Bank
Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution said Oct. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
