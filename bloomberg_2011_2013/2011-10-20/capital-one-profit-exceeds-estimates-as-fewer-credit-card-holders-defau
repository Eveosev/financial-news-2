Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the
credit-card issuer seeking approval to purchase  ING Groep NV (INGA) ’s
U.S. online bank, rose the most among financial stocks in  New
York  trading after announcing a 1.3 percent profit gain.  Shares of the company climbed $2.80, or 6.9 percent, to
$43.29 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The increase was the biggest among the 81 firms in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index, which advanced 2.4
percent.  Capital One, led by Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank, yesterday reported third-quarter net income of $813
million, or $1.77 a share, compared with $803 million, or $1.76,
in the same period a year earlier. Earnings from continuing
operations at the McLean, Virginia-based company were $1.88 a
share, beating the $1.68 estimate of 28 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Lending increased and fewer borrowers defaulted.  “We believe the period of shrinking loans through the
great recession has come to an end,” Fairbank said on a
conference call with analysts yesterday after the close on the
NYSE, when results were announced. Total loans increased $987
million to $130 billion, driven by growth in auto and commercial
banking.  Hiring Workers  Capital One, which gets more than half its revenue from
credit cards, aims to expand through acquisitions and is hiring
workers as other U.S. lenders retrench. Fairbank, 61, is seeking
Federal Reserve approval for the ING purchase, which would add
more than 7 million customers and $80 billion in deposits. In
addition to ING, Capital One agreed earlier this year to
purchase  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s U.S. credit-card portfolio.  “We expect that credit and revenue trends will remain in
recovery mode and that the two previously announced acquisitions
will be substantially accretive in 2012,” Chris Kotowski, an
Oppenheimer & Co. analyst in New York, wrote in an Oct. 9 note
to clients.  The Fed held three hearings to allow public input on the
ING acquisition and extended the comment period until Oct. 12
amid opposition to the purchase from groups that advocate for
consumer rights and affordable housing, including the National
Community Reinvestment Coalition. The deal is scheduled to be
completed later this year or in early 2012. The HSBC transaction
is set to close in the second quarter of 2012.  Net Interest Margin  Revenue climbed 4 percent from the second quarter to $4.15
billion. Net interest margin, the difference between what banks
pay to borrow money and what they get for loans and on
securities, expanded to 7.39 percent in the third quarter from
7.2 percent in the preceding three-month period.  Provisions for loan and lease losses rose to $622 million
from $343 million, the first increase since last year’s third
quarter, while net write-offs fell 13 percent to $812 million
from $931 million in the second quarter.  Credit-card write-offs dropped to 4.23 percent from 5.06
percent in the prior three-month period, while the defaults on
auto loans climbed to 1.69 percent from 1.11 percent.  The lender also reported a $266 million loss tied to
derivatives with a notional amount of $23.8 billion intended to
reduce the amount of capital needed for the ING deal if  interest
rates  rise. The loss was mitigated by a $239 million gain on the
sale of $6.4 billion in mostly agency mortgage-backed
securities, the company said.  1,000 Branches  Capital One, which employed 27,800 people at the end of
2010, plans to end 2011 with at least 3,600 more workers,
Tatiana Stead, a spokeswoman, said last month. The company is
hiring bankers, financial analysts and call-center employees,
among others, she said. The firm has about 1,000 branches in New
York,  New Jersey , Connecticut, Delaware, Virginia, Maryland,
Texas, Louisiana and Washington, D.C.  Write-offs for credit-card loans that Capital One deemed
uncollectible fell to 3.9 percent last month, from 4.1 percent
in August and 8.38 percent in September 2010, according to
company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Stagnating economic growth and slumping wages may begin to
reverse those declines. Loans at least 30 days overdue, a signal
of future write-offs, climbed to 3.65 percent in September, the
fourth consecutive monthly increase. That’s the second-highest
delinquency rate among the six-biggest U.S. credit-card issuers
after  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America Corp.
Lenders typically write-off soured card loans after 180 days.  Poverty Rate  Take-home pay in the U.S., adjusted for prices, fell 0.3
percent in August, the third decrease in five months, and
personal income dropped for the first time in two years, the
Commerce Department reported last month. The declines followed
news from the Census Bureau that median  household income  in 2010
fell to $49,445, the lowest in more than a decade, and the
poverty rate jumped to 15.1 percent, a 17-year high.  American Express Co., the biggest credit-card issuer by
purchases, posted a third-quarter profit of $1.24 billion,
beating analysts’ estimates, as customer spending climbed and
fewer borrowers defaulted. U.S. card income rose 23 percent
year-over-year to $733 million, while international card income
climbed 53 percent to $221 million, AmEx said Oct. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
