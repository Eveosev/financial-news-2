Jerome Harrison underwent a physical
with the  Philadelphia Eagles  that found a brain tumor, voiding a
trade with the Detroit Lions,  ESPN reports .  The Eagles agreed two days ago to send Ronnie Brown to the
Lions for Harrison in a swap of backup running backs. The trade
was contingent on a medical exam, which detected the tumor, ESPN
said, citing two unidentified people in the  National Football
League .  Harrison, 28, is now undergoing treatment and probably
wonâ€™t play again this season, ESPN said. His long-term prognosis
is good, the sports network said.  Eagles spokesman Derek Boyko declined comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
