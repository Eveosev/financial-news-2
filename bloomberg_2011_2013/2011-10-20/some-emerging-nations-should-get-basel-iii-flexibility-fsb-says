Global regulators said some
governments in emerging markets and developing economies should
be given the flexibility to adopt international rules on bank
capital “at a pace tailored to their circumstances.”  While parts of the rules, drawn up by the  Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision , “are very relevant and may be useful to
implement quickly, the full-scale adoption of the framework may
distract” countries “from more basic and urgent reform
priorities,” the Financial Stability Board,  International
Monetary Fund  and  World Bank  said in a report published on the
FSB’s website today.  The flexibility on the rules, known as  Basel II  and Basel
III, shouldn’t apply to countries that are members of the Group
of 20 nations or the FSB, according to the report. These
countries should implement the measures in line with the
international timetable, which foresees full adoption of Basel
III on Jan. 1, 2019.  To contact the reporters on this story:
