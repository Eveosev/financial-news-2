Indonesia ’s rupiah fell for the
first time this week as divisions among European leaders over
how to resolve the region’s debt crisis damped demand for
higher-yielding emerging-market assets. Bonds rose.  French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  said yesterday that
Europe’s bailout fund would be best enhanced with help from the
 European Central Bank , a position the ECB and German government
oppose. The rupiah recouped losses toward the close of trading
in the past two days on speculation the central bank intervened.
Bank Indonesia is selling the dollar when needed to ease
volatility, Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono said on Oct. 7.  “Europe’s debt issues are influencing the regional markets
including the rupiah,” said Wiling Bolung, head of treasury at
ANZ Panin Bank in Jakarta. The declines in the currency “may be
limited as the central bank is looking to reduce volatility,”
he said.  The rupiah dropped 0.3 percent to 8,825 per dollar as of
4:15 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency slipped as much as 0.7
percent earlier.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds
dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.31
percent today, according to the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
