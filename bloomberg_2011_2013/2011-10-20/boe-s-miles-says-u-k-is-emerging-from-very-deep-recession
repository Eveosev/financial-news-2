Bank of England policy maker  David
Miles  said the U.K. is emerging from a very deep recession and
that the bank is working to support the recovery.  “We’re emerging from a very deep recession and are to
trying keep demand going” with a record-low interest rate and
so-called quantitative easing, he said in an interview today on
BBC Radio Cumbria.  He said “very few” people say they need higher  interest
rates , and that “most households see they’ve been squeezed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
