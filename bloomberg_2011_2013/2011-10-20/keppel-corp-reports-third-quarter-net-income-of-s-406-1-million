Keppel Corp., the world’s largest
oil-rig maker, posted a 33 percent jump in third-quarter profit
as higher crude prices stoked demand for drilling equipment.  Net income climbed to S$406.1 million ($320 million) from a
restated S$304.6 million a year earlier, the company said in a
statement to the Singapore stock exchange today. Sales gained 18
percent to S$2.7 billion.  Keppel has won a record S$8.7 billion of new orders so far
this year as energy companies boost spending on offshore and
deepwater drilling equipment to benefit from an increase in  oil
prices . Royal Dutch Shell Plc has said it plans to spend $100
billion on projects in four years through 2014.  The offshore and marine business “sees good prospects for
its deepwater solutions with the projected increase in deepwater
capital expenditure for the next few years,” the company said
in the statement. “Drilling in the  North Sea  has been
revitalized by new major oil finds and the  Gulf of Mexico  is
returning gradually to normalcy with the issue of permits.”  Keppel fell 0.8 percent to close at S$8.78 in Singapore
trading before the earnings announcement. The shares have
dropped 15 percent this year, compared with the 30-stock Straits
Times Index’s 16 percent decline.  Order Book  New orders this year boosted the company’s order book to
S$9 billion, with deliveries stretching into 2014, according to
the statement.  Keppel’s offshore arm, which makes products including
jackup rigs and deepwater equipment, reported a 38 percent
increase in third-quarter profit to S$340 million, while sales
rose 12 percent to S$1.64 billion. Operating profit gained 54
percent to S$426 million, widening the margin to sales to 26
percent from 19 percent a year earlier.  The company doesn’t expect to maintain margins of more than
20 percent as the value of orders it won recently are at lower
prices than those won before the credit crisis, Chief Executive
Officer Choo Chiau Beng said today.  Keppel’s property unit,  Keppel Land Ltd. (KPLD) , said yesterday
third-quarter net income gained 6.6 percent to S$58 million.
Sales fell 14 percent to S$111.7 million. Keppel also has a
utilities arm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
