Venezuela’s government will boost
spending by 46 percent in 2012 as President  Hugo Chavez  seeks
resources to fund housing, agriculture and job creation plans
that are pillars of his re-election bid next October.  Expenditures will jump to 297.8 billion bolivars ($69.34
billion) while estimates see the economy expanding 5 percent and
the Western Hemisphere’s highest inflation rate falling to
between 20 percent to 22 percent, Finance Minister  Jorge Giordani  said today during a presentation of the budget proposal
to the National Assembly. Consumer prices rose 26.7 percent from
a year earlier in September.  “The budget will help our plans for growth,” Giordani
said in comments broadcast on state television. “We are already
in a phase of growth, and it will be possible to grow 5 percent
in 2012 thanks to our investments in oil projects and social
programs.”  The bolivar won’t be devalued next year, Giordani said.  Chavez is looking to ramp up spending as he campaigns to
win a third consecutive six-year term in the Oct. 7, 2012,
elections. The economy, which grew 3.6 percent in the first half
of 2011, is lagging others in the region, even as the average
price of Venezuelan crude oil exports has averaged a record
$99.58 a barrel this year.  ‘Technically Correct’  The government will set a ceiling for new debt of 81.7
billion bolivars in 2012, of which 25.8 billion bolivars will be
used to service outstanding borrowing, Giordani said. The
country’s debt servicing costs will rise 141 percent next year
after the government issued $7.2 billion of bonds this year with
interest rates of 11.95 percent and 11.75 percent.  Venezuela  expects to finance 55 percent of government
spending with non-oil sources of income, according to Giordani.  “The projections for inflation in 2012 are technically
correct and achievable,” central bank President Nelson Merentes
said in comments carried on state television. “We will
concentrate a great deal more on reducing inflation.”  Venezuela, the largest oil producer in  South America ,
depends on oil for 95 percent of export revenue and almost half
of government spending. The budget was calculated using an
average oil export price of $50 a barrel, Giordani said.
 Mexico ’s finance committee in the lower house of Congress
approved an estimated oil price of $84.9 a barrel for next
year’s budget.  Deficit, Protection  Venezuela often sets a conservative oil export prices in
the budget in order to protect against volatility in the energy
markets. The budget is considered a floor on spending with
expenditures rising during the year through “additional
credits” awarded discretionally by Chavez to ministries.  So far in 2011, the National Assembly has approved 128.6
billion bolivars in additional credits beyond the 2011 budget of
204.2 billion bolivars.  Venezuela expects a deficit of 3.6 percent of gross
domestic product in 2012, a wider deficit than the 3.4 percent
posted in 2010. Venezuela’s proposed budget represents 19
percent of the 1.58 trillion bolivars GDP expected next year,
according to the proposal.  “ Government spending  in Venezuela is a tool to stimulate
economic growth,” Giordani said today. “We’re dedicated to
protecting the Venezuelan economy from the structural
international crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
