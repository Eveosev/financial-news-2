Germany  plans to reduce income tax
by as much as 7 billion euros next year, Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  said today in Berlin.  The step is aimed at ironing out an inconstistency in the
tax burden when employed people move between tax categories,
known as “cold progression,” Schaeuble told reporters during a
presentation of new economic forecasts. Schaeuble said the
government doesn’t plan automatic tax adjustments but will
review the tax burden every two years.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
