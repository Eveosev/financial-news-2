Outokumpu Oyj (OUT1V) , a Finnish maker of
stainless steel, plans to cut 1,300 jobs as excess capacity and
weaker demand hurt profits. The shares jumped.  Outokumpu is targeting 100 million euros ($137 million) of
cost cuts by the end of 2012 and a reduction in working capital
of 250 million euros by the summer of 2013, the Espoo, Finland-
based company said today in a statement.  “To compete successfully in the global market, we need to
reduce costs drastically and simplify the way we manage the
company,” Chief Executive Officer Mika Seitovirta said in the
statement. “European market fundamentals have changed
substantially in recent years.”  Outokumpu rose as much as 11 percent to 5.70 euros, the
most since May last year. The shares traded 8.2 percent higher
at 10:06 a.m. in Helsinki.  Outokumpu’s third-quarter net loss widened to 134 million
euros from 56 million euros in the same period last year. The
mean estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a net
loss of 92.1 million euros.  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis and lower metal prices hurt
demand for stainless steel, leading expected delivery volumes to
fall this quarter below  third-quarter levels, Outokumpu said.
As many as 600 job cuts will be in  Sweden  and 300 in  Finland ,
Outokumpu said.  “Demand has not yet fully recovered following the previous
financial crisis,” Seitovirta said. “The stainless industry is
facing significant overcapacity, and imports into Europe have
increased.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
