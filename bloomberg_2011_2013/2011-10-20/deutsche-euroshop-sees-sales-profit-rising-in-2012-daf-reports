Deutsche EuroShop AG (DEQ)  expects a
“considerable” increase in sales and profit next year,  DAF
Deutsches Anleger Fernsehen  reported, citing an interview with
Chief Financial Officer Olaf Borkers.  The company expects sales of more than 200 million euros
($274 million) and a double-digit percent increase in earnings
before interest and taxes and in net income, the broadcaster
said in an e-mailed synopsis of the interview.  Sales will be “slightly higher” this year than the
previously forecast 188 million euros, the broadcaster quoted
Borkers as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
