Thailand’s baht fell the most since
January after central bank Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul
signaled the bank is willing to consider cutting  interest rates 
as the nation’s worst flood in 50 years threatens to slow growth.  The Bank of Thailand left the benchmark one-day bond
repurchase rate unchanged yesterday at 3.50 percent, halting its
longest stretch of rate increases in five years, and warned that
the floods will crimp economic growth. The waters have affected
14,254 factories and businesses in 20 provinces, according to
the Labor Ministry. The government’s three-year bonds have
rallied this month as official data on Oct. 3 showed consumer
prices rose 4.03 percent in September from a year earlier, the
least since March.  “The floods will hurt tourism, production, distribution
and supply chains and reduce exports, hurting the baht,” said
Minori Uchida, a senior analyst in  Tokyo  at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. “It is even possible the central bank will
cut rates should inflation stabilize and that would also be
negative for the baht.”  The baht lost 0.9 percent, the most since Jan. 10, to 30.98
per dollar as of 3:26 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency may weaken to about 31.50
before the year-end, Uchida said.  The yield on the 5.25 percent bonds due May 2014 increased
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.33 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate has dropped 21
basis points this month.  The central bank will cut its forecast for economic growth
this year by more than 1 percent, from a current target of 4.1
percent, because of the floods, Prasarn said today. The Bank of
 Thailand  would be willing to hold a special meeting to discuss
further easing of monetary policy “if needed,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
