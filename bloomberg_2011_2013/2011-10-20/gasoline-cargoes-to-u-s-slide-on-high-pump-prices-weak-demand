Gasoline shipments from  Europe 
across the Atlantic Ocean will decline during the next two weeks
because of rising fuel prices and weaker demand in the U.S.  Twenty-seven tankers were booked or due to be chartered for
loading in the two-week period, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey of five shipbrokers, one owner and
two traders yesterday. That’s a decline of 6.9 percent from last
week.  “U.S. refineries have cut production, gasoline prices are
still high, and demand for gasoline from Europe is weak because
of deteriorating economic activity,”  Eugen Weinberg , head of
commodities research at Commerzbank AG, said by phone from
 Frankfurt  today.  Bloomberg’s weekly Consumer Comfort Index’s monthly
expectations gauge dropped to minus 45, the worst reading since
February 2009. The weekly measure of current conditions was
minus 48.4 for the period ended Oct. 16, up from minus 50.8 the
prior week that was close to a record low.  Pump prices for regular gasoline increased 0.5 cent to
$3.474 a gallon on average nationwide on Oct. 18, according to
the American Automobile Association. That’s the highest level
since Sept. 26. Refined oil product imports fell to the lowest
level in 12 years, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.  Medium-Range Tankers  Of the 27 vessels in the survey, known in the industry as
medium-range tankers, 14 have been booked and 13 more will
probably be hired, according to the responses. They will be able
to carry about 8.5 million barrels of gasoline, or 607,000
barrels a day over the next two weeks. The daily rate is 74
percent of the 824,000 barrels the U.S. imported over the past
year, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.  There are 31 vessels likely to be available to carry trans-
Atlantic gasoline cargoes, three more than in last week’s
survey, and 11 more than a month earlier, the survey showed.  Daily rental income for tankers carrying the fuel across
the Atlantic Ocean fell 9.1 percent to $3,590 today, according
to the  Baltic Exchange  in London. That’s the lowest return since
Sept. 19, data from the exchange show.  The survey is based on so-called single-voyage, or spot,
charters and excludes loadings under longer-term contracts. It
assumes shipments to the U.S. East Coast from northwestern
Europe. Each tanker would normally haul about 37,000 tons of
cargo, or 315,000 barrels.  Charter rates on the route fell 1.1 percent to 135.42
industry-standard Worldscale points, according to the exchange.  The points are a percentage of a nominal rate, or flat
rate, for more than 320,000 specific routes. Flat rates for
every voyage, quoted in U.S. dollars a ton, are revised annually
by the Worldscale Association in London to reflect changing fuel
costs, port tariffs and exchange rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
