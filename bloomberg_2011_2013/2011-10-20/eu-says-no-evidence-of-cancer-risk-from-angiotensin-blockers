The European Medicines Agency said a
review of research doesn’t show any risk of cancer from a class
of heart drugs that includes  Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s Diovan, Boehringer
Ingelheim GmbH’s Micardis and Merck & Co.’s Cozaar.  The Italian Medicines Agency requested the review of the
medicines known as angiotensin receptor blockers after the
publication of an analysis that showed increased risk of new
cancers, particularly lung tumors, compared with placebo and
other heart medicines, the agency said today in a  statement .  “The evidence from the meta-analysis was weak, noting
several problems with the quality of the data,” the European
agency said in the statement.  Angiotensin receptor blockers, known as ARBs, relax blood
vessels by blocking the effects of a hormone that increases
blood pressure. Diovan, Novartis’s best-selling drug, generated
more than $6 billion in revenue in 2010.  Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  last year won U.S. regulatory approval for a
generic version of Cozaar.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
