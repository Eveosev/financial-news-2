The following is the text
of  Canada 's wholesale trade report for August from
 Statistics Canada .  Wholesale sales edged up 0.2% in August to $48.4
billion following a 0.9% advance in July.  Increases were reported in all of the subsectors,
except for the miscellaneous, and the building material
and supplies subsectors.  Wholesale sales edge up in August  In volume terms, wholesale sales fell 0.9% in August.  The difference between the growth rate expressed in
current and constant dollars reflects higher prices for
the imported products sold by wholesalers. This was partly
attributable to the depreciation of the Canadian dollar
relative to the American dollar during the month.  Increases in most subsectors  In August, five out of seven subsectors, representing
close to 75% of total sales, reported increases.  The largest increase in dollar terms came in the
machinery, equipment and supplies subsector. Sales rose
0.7% to $10.5 billion in August, the sixth monthly sales
increase since the beginning of the year. All of the gains
in this subsector came from the farm, lawn and garden
machinery and equipment industry (+10.6%).  The food, beverages and tobacco products subsector
(+0.5%) continued its upward trend that began in late
2009. The food products industry, which accounts for close
to 90% of the subsector, increased 0.3% in August.  Sales in the motor vehicle and parts subsector gained
0.4%, reflecting an increase of 1.7% in the motor vehicle
industry. Sales in this industry reached $6.1 billion in
August, their highest level since July 2008. The other
major industry in this subsector, new motor vehicle parts
and accessories, saw sales fall 4.0% following an increase
of 3.1% the previous month.  The largest decline in August occurred in the
miscellaneous subsector (-1.1%), which reflected a 13.7%
decrease in the agricultural supplies industry. Declines
in July and August in this industry offset large increases
in May and June.  The building material and supplies subsector fell 0.7%,
pushed down by the metal service centres (-1.9%) and the
lumber, millwork, hardware and other building supplies 
(-0.7%) industries.  Wholesale sales up in most provinces  Alberta  and Ontario posted the largest increases in
dollar terms in August.  In Alberta, sales grew by 1.1% in August following a
decrease of 0.1% the previous month. Higher sales in
several subsectors, including machinery, equipment and
supplies and food, beverage and tobacco products helped
fuel the growth.  Sales in Ontario edged up 0.2% in August, following a
1.8% increase in July.  Wholesalers in Saskatchewan posted the largest sales
decrease, (-4.8%). Weakness in the agricultural supplies
industry was a major factor contributing to this decline.  Wholesale sales in  Quebec  remained unchanged in August.  Three out of four Atlantic provinces advanced, with
Nova Scotia (+2.9%) recording the largest increase in
dollar terms.  New Brunswick  (-0.2%) posted the only loss.  Inventories continue to rise  Inventories rose 0.9% to $57.2 billion in August,
posting their eighth consecutive monthly increase.  Inventories were up in 19 of the 25 wholesale
industries. Wholesalers in the motor vehicle industry
(+5.7%), other machinery, equipment and supplies industry
(+2.1%), and the pharmaceuticals and pharmacy supplies
industry (+1.1%) reported the largest gains in dollar
terms.  The inventory-to-sales ratio increased from 1.17 in
July to 1.18 in August.  The inventory-to-sales ratio is a measure of the time
in months required to exhaust inventories if sales were to
remain at their current level.  Note to readers  All the data in this release are seasonally adjusted
and in current dollars, unless otherwise noted.  Wholesale sales expressed in volume are calculated by
deflating current dollar values using import and industry
product price indexes. Since many of the goods sold by
wholesalers are imported, fluctuations in the value of the
Canadian dollar can have an important influence on the
prices of goods bought and sold by wholesalers.  The wholesale sales series in chained (2002) dollars is
a chained Fisher volume index with 2002 as the reference
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
