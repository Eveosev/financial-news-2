Chairman  Jim O’Neill  said support from European leaders for
 Italy  is critical for resolving the euro-zone debt crisis.  “Italy is what it’s all about now,” O’Neill said in an
interview on CNBC today. “Whatever they do, they’ve got to
ensure Italy is funded.”  “There appears to be such a ingrained negative mood,”
O’Neill told CNBC. “People are convinced that the euro zone
going down will drag the U.S. down. That’s possible,” but it’s
also may not happen, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
