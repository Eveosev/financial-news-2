Ireland’s European Affairs Minister
Lucinda Creighton said European banks are “bending under the
weight of solvency doubts.”   “We want to see the EFSF utilised in the most flexible way
possible to raise its capacity and ensure fairness including
safeguarding the other programme countries  and  vulnerable
economies within the Eurozone,” she said in an e-mailed speech
today. “We wish to see a credible strategy for recapitalisation
of European banks, which are bending under the weight of
solvency doubts.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
