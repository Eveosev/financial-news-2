The pound may weaken 5 percent to
$1.50 within three months as it runs into levels of so-called
resistance, Commerzbank AG said, citing trading patterns.  The U.K. currency, which strengthened 1.7 percent against
the dollar last week, will seen its gains capped as it reaches
its 55-day moving average and the 50 percent Fibonacci
retracement of its decline from an April high, said  Karen Jones ,
a London-based technical strategist at the German bank. After
hitting this resistance, the pound will fall to its October low
of $1.5272 before dropping toward $1.50, Jones wrote in a note
to investors.  “The market faces tough resistance,” Jones wrote. Failure
to break these levels “should be enough to refocus attention on
the downside.”  The pound traded at $1.5794 at 12:51 p.m. in  London . It
reached this year’s high of $1.6747 on April 28 and then fell to
the 2012 low of $1.5272 on Oct. 6, Bloomberg data show. The 55-
day moving average was $1.5945 today.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that asset prices
tend to rise or fall by certain percentages after reaching a
high or low. Resistance refers to an area where selling orders
may be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
