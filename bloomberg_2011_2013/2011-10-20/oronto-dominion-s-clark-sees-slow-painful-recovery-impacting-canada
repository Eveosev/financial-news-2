The economic recovery in the U.S.
and  Europe  is likely to be “slow and painful” and will have a
“profound” effect on Canada,  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  Chief
Executive Officer  Edmund Clark  said.  “The prolonged period of slow growth expected will have a
profound effect on Canada’s recovery and economy,” Clark said
last night in Toronto after accepting the 2011 Ivey Business
Leader award, according to the text of his speech.  The economic slowdown will lead to a gap between government
revenue and expenses, putting more pressure on governments to
cut costs, Clark said.  “More importantly, it also risks increasing the structural
fiscal deficit as the prolonged period of low growth reduces the
growth potential of the economy,” Clark said in his speech at
the Four Seasons hotel.  While Canada’s reaction to market pressures was different
than the U.S., the country is unlikely to avoid a crisis of
“potential broken promises in the future,” Clark said.  “Canada has come though the financial crisis relatively
well, and we are rightly proud of this and past efforts that
have placed us in good standing,” said Clark. “But looking
forward we face many of the same challenges as the western
world.”  Toronto-Dominion is Canada’s second-largest bank by assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
