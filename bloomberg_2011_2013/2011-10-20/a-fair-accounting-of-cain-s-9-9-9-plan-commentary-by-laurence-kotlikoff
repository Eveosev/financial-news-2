Republican presidential candidate
 Herman Cain  has risen in the polls thanks, in large part, to his
 9-9-9 plan , which would replace most of the U.S. federal tax
system with a 9 percent personal-income tax, a 9 percent retail-
sales tax and a 9 percent value-added tax.  Cain’s supporters love 9-9-9’s simplicity and transparency
and think it would do wonders for the economy. His detractors
say it’s horribly regressive. As New York Times columnist
Timothy Egan put it: “Cain is proposing the largest shift in tax
burden from the wealthy to the poor and middle class in the
nation’s history.”  Neither side is completely right. It’s not as bad as its
detractors say, but it could be a lot better. To be clear, I
don’t support Cain, and I find some of his remarks outrageous,
particularly the disparaging ones about Occupy  Wall Street . But
we’re not going to find common ground in this country if the
left and the right distort each other’s proposals.  Evaluating Cain’s plan is difficult, even for a trained
economist.  To understand how different income groups would fare
under 9-9-9, one must recognize that tax reforms affect
households over people’s entire remaining lives, and do so
differently at different ages. To that end, I used financial-
planning  software  to compute households’ taxes for each future
year and determine their sustainable living standards -- the
amounts they can spend annually without running out of money.  The result: Commentators are mistaken when it comes to 9-9-
9’s treatment of those with lots of wealth and little or no
labor income, but they are correct in saying that it is highly
regressive with respect to working Americans.  Four Couples  Consider four 45-year-old married couples, who all live in
 Texas  and have two young children each. One is super-rich, one
is upper income, one is middle income, and one is very poor.  We’ll start with the Riches. They have $7.5 million in
investments on which they earn 3 percentage points above
inflation on average. They own two $2 million homes with
significant mortgages. Neither spouse works. Under today’s tax
system, the couple can spend $128,422 each year, measured in
today’s dollars, after meeting their housing costs, child care
and taxes. Under 9-9-9, the Riches would get to consume
$103,071, which is 20 percent less.  Why? Commentators miss the fact that rich folk spend money,
too. Indeed, any well-trained public-finance economist knows
that taxing spending is equivalent to taxing what’s used to pay
for consumption -- current wealth as well as current and future
wages. Hence, the 9 percent retail-sales tax and the 9 percent
value-added tax add up to an 18 percent tax on wealth.  Can’t Escape  As a result, instead of paying only 15 percent on the
dividends and  capital gains  they get from their investments, the
Riches will pay a 9 percent tax on their investment income
(excluding capital gains) and 18 percent on their spending.
Moreover, the Riches can’t escape the tax by leaving their money
to their children. Whatever the kids inherit will have 18
percent less purchasing power.  Now for the Uppers. Each spouse earns $250,000, each has
$750,000 in a 401(k) retirement account, each contributes
$10,000 annually to the 401(k), enjoys a $10,000 employer match,
and has a $25,000 checking account. Their $2 million house is
mortgaged to the tune of $1 million.  Under the current system,
the Uppers can spend $180,711 per year. Under 9-9-9, their
consumption rises to $204,040. That’s a 13 percent improvement.  Each of the Middles earns $40,000, has $100,000 in a 401(k)
account and contributes $1,500 annually, receives a $1,500
match, and has a $5,000 checking account. They owe $100,000 on
their $200,000 house. Today, the Middles can spend $42,074 per
year. Under 9-9-9, that falls by 5 percent to $40,031.  The Poors  Finally, the Poors earn $15,000 each. They have no
retirement or checking accounts, and pay $700 a month in rent.
Their sustainable discretionary expenditure is $12,387 a year.
Under 9-9-9, it’s $9,197. That’s 26 percent less.  In sum, 9-9-9 is highly progressive in some ways and highly
regressive in others. There are various ways Cain can revise his
proposal to remedy its flaws. Alternatively, he could simply
ditch 9-9-9 and adopt a proposal I have advanced, known as the
 Purple Tax Plan . It replaces the corporate-income, personal-
income, and estate and gift taxes with progressive levies on
payrolls, consumption and inheritances. The effective rate for
all three taxes is 15 percent.  The plan lowers the Riches’ living standard by 24 percent,
while raising the  living standards  of the Uppers and Middles by
5 percent and the Poors by 11 percent. It is designed to help
working Americans, make those with wealth pay more, improve
incentives to work and eliminate disincentives to save. Best
yet, it makes April 15 just another day, since neither
households nor firms need to file annual tax returns.  The Purple Tax Plan is simple, transparent, progressive and
efficient. My advice: Forget 9-9-9 and adopt 15-15-15, which
will really get everybody on board and the economy moving.  ( Laurence J. Kotlikoff , a professor of economics at  Boston
