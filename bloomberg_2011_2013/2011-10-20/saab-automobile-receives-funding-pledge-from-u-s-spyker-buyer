Saab Automobile  and parent company
Swedish Automobile NV said they will receive funding from North
Street Capital LP to help continue the reorganization of the
cash-strapped Swedish carmaker.  North Street Capital will lend $60 million to Saab, subject
to further documentation, Swedish Automobile said today in a
statement. The Greenwich, Connecticut-based private equity firm
will also buy 2.39 million new Swedish Automobile shares at
$4.19 per share.  “Immediate availability of funding is necessary to
continue the reorganization process of Saab Automobile,”
Zeewolde, Netherlands-based Swedish Automobile said in the
release.  Saab, which has produced few cars since it first halted
production in March because of a lack of money, staved off
bankruptcy after a Swedish court on Sept. 21 granted the
carmaker’s request for protection from creditors. A Swedish
district court will meet Oct. 31 to decide whether the
reorganization can continue.  North Street Capital on Sept. 29 agreed to buy Swedish
Automobile’s Spyker sports-car unit for 32 million euros ($44
million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
