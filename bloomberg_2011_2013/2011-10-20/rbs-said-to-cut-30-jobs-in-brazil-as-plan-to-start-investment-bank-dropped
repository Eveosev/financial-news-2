Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. (RBS) 
will cut about 30 jobs in  Brazil  as the lender abandons plans to
start an investment bank in the South American country, said two
people familiar with the matter.  Carlos Braga, who heads the unit, and senior economist
Zeina Latif are among the employees being fired, said one
person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the job cuts
haven’t been announced publicly. RBS won’t follow through with a
plan to open the unit, according to an e-mailed statement today
from  Michael Geller , a company spokesman.  “After careful consideration, we have concluded that it is
not prudent to commit the necessary investment that would be
required to successfully build an onshore presence in Brazil,”
Edinburgh-based RBS said in the statement. “We will continue to
work closely with our clients in an offshore capacity.”  Brazil’s National Monetary Council in June approved RBS’s
application to open an investment bank. The unit would have
begun operations with 140 million reais ($78 million) of
capital, Adalberto Gomes da Rocha, head of the central bank’s
department of financial system organization, said at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
