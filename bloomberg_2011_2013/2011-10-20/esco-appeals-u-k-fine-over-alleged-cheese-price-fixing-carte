Tesco Plc (TSCO) , Britain’s largest
supermarket chain, appealed a U.K. regulator’s 10.4 million
pound ($16.4 million) fine over an alleged conspiracy to fix the
price of cheese products nearly a decade ago.  The  Office of Fair Trading  was wrong to find Tesco colluded
with dairy producers to share prices with  J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY) , Wal-
Mart Stores Inc.’s Asda chain and other retailers in 2002 and
2003, according to an Oct. 17 outline of the case posted on the
website of the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London. Tesco has
said the alleged violations followed lobbying by British dairy
farmers for higher prices.  “The seven other parties facing a penalty have admitted
their involvement, have not appealed and are paying their
fine,” Kasia Reardon, a spokeswoman for the watchdog, said
today in a statement.  The OFT left the penalty against Cheshunt, England-based
Tesco unchanged when it reduced the total fines in the case for
the second time in August to 49.5 million pounds after other
companies sought to resolve the probe and cooperated. The levies
had totaled 116 million pounds when they were first issued in
2007. They were lowered to 70 million pounds last year after the
OFT dropped some claims because of insufficient evidence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
