The pound weakened against the
dollar and yen as signs of a split among the European leaders on
a plan to resolve the debt crisis drove investors to seek out
safer investments.  Sterling fell versus 12 of its 16 major counterparts as
Germany and  France  disagreed over the role of the  European
Central Bank  which has rejected using its balance sheet to
bolster the 440 billion-euro ($602 billion) European Financial
Stability Facility. The pound briefly reversed losses as a draft
document showed the bailout fund may be authorized to provide
additional funds to nations such as Italy and  Spain . Gilts were
little changed.  The pound move “is all euro-zone driven,” said  Chris Walker , a currency strategist at UBS AG in London. “Over the
next one-to-three months I could see sterling pushing to between
$1.55 and $1.50.”  The pound weakened 0.5 percent to $1.5692 at 4:174 p.m.
London time, after rising as much as 0.2 percent. Sterling
depreciated 0.4 percent to 120.63 yen, and was little changed at
87.17 pence per euro.  The pound has declined 0.8 percent in the past six months
and 2.9 percent in the past year, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which measure a basket of 10
developed-market currencies.  The German government doesn’t rule out postponing a summit
planned for Oct. 23 due to stalling negotiations about the so-
called leveraging of the EFSF, Die Welt reported, citing
unidentified people close to the country’s governing coalition.  ‘Spike Higher’  “It may be that we do see the euro attempting to spike
higher on any signs that progress is being made,” said  Ian Stannard , head of European currency strategy at Morgan Stanley
in London. “Any positive European news is going to see euro”
moving toward the top end of its trading range against the
pound, he said.  The pound may weaken to $1.50 within three months as it
runs into so-called resistance, Commerzbank AG said, citing
trading patterns.  The U.K. currency will seen its gains versus the greenback
capped as it reaches its 55-day moving average and the 50
percent Fibonacci retracement of its decline from an April high,
said  Karen Jones , a London-based technical strategist at the
German bank.  The 10-year gilt yielded 2.46 percent. The price of the
3.75 percent security maturing September 2021 was little changed
at 111.24.  The U.K. sold 4.75 billion pounds of 1.75 percent notes due
in January 2017 at an average yield of 1.547 percent, the Debt
Management Office said. That’s up from 1.394 percent at the
previous auction on Sept. 22. Demand rose to 1.7 times the
amount on offer, from 1.2 times.  U.K. government debt has handed investors a return of 12
percent this year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies,
surpassing the 6.7 percent gain for German bunds.  -- With assistance from Emma Charlton in  London . Editors:
