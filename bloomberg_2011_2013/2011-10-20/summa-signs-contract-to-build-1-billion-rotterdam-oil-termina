Summa Group, a Russian port operator
and construction company, signed a contract to build and operate
a $1 billion oil terminal in  Rotterdam , Chairman Ziyavudin Magomedov said.  Construction may begin in 2013 with the terminal scheduled
to start operating in 2015, First Vice President Alexander
Vinokurov said today in Moscow. Magomedov and Vinokurov spoke
after a signing ceremony attended by Dutch Prime Minister  Mark
Rutte  and Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  at the Kremlin.  The terminal is expected to become a European trading hub
for Urals, Russia’s benchmark export crude, the Kremlin said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Summa and its partner in the
project VTTI, a terminal operator half owned by energy trader
Vitol Group, plan to build about 3 million cubic meters of
capacity for Urals and oil products, according to a company
statement distributed to reporters today.  Most of the oil will be supplied via  Russia ’s Primorsk
port, accoring to the statement. The terminal will have an area
of 55 hectares.  Summa holds 75 percent of the Shtandart TT BV, the venture
formed for the project, and VTTI owns the rest.  To contact the reporters on this story:
