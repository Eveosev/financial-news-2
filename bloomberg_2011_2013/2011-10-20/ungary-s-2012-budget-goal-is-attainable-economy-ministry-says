Hungary’s 2012 budget-deficit target
of less than 2.5 percent of gross domestic product is
attainable, the Economy Ministry in Budapest said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The central bank, which expects the shortfall to reach 3.1
percent, disregarded -- because of its methodology -- the budget
effect of certain measures whose legal framework is being
constructed, the ministry said.  The government’s position on criticism about the
effectiveness of taxes, contributions and revenue collection
continues to be that the income and savings figures in the
budget draft submitted to lawmakers are adequately founded and
will help achieve the targeted budget deficit of less than 2.5
percent of GDP, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
