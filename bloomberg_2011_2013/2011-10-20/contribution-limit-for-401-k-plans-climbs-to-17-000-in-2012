Taxpayers will be able to set aside
an extra $500 in 401(k) plans and benefit from an additional
$120,000 estate tax exemption in 2012, under cost-of-living
adjustments announced by the  Internal Revenue Service .  The 401(k) contribution cap will be $17,000 in 2012, up
from $16,500 this year. The 401(k) limits also affect
contributions to similar accounts, including the 403(b) plans
for school employees and nonprofit workers and the Thrift
Savings Plan for federal employees.  The estate tax exemption for 2012 will be $5.12 million, up
from $5 million this year. The higher threshold is scheduled to
expire at the end of 2012, and the $1 million limit under
previous law is set to return. The annual exclusion for the gift
tax will be $13,000, unchanged from 2011.  The IRS announcement on cost-of-living adjustments for 2012
also affects the standard deduction, the personal exemption,
income thresholds for various tax benefits and the size of the
tax brackets.  The personal exemption will be $3,800, up from $3,700 this
year. The standard deduction for married couples will be
$11,900, up from $11,600 for 2011.  Top Tax Bracket  The top income tax bracket of 35 percent will apply to
taxable income exceeding $388,350 for married couples and
individual filers, up from $379,150 this year.  Inflation adjustments apply to provisions across the  tax
code . For example, the excise tax on some arrow shafts for
archery and hunting will be 46 cents each, up from 45 cents.
Also, married couples with modified adjusted gross income
exceeding $155,000 will receive no benefit from the tax
deduction for student loan interest, up from $150,000 in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
