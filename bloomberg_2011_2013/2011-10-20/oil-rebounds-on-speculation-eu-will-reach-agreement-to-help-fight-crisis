Oil rebounded on speculation that
European Union leaders will reach agreement on enhancing their
rescue fund and help fight the region’s debt crisis.  Futures rose as much as 1.2 percent in  London  as details on
the EU measures emerged. The new fund may be authorized to
provide credit lines amounting to as much as 10 percent of a
country’s economy, a draft document obtained by Bloomberg News
showed. Prices dipped briefly on reports that deposed Libyan
leader Muammar Qaddafi was arrested by rebel forces.  “If the EU manages to draw up the lines of a support
package large enough to rebuild the trust of the market we
expect  oil prices  to move up,” said Thina Saltvedt, an analyst
at Nordea Bank AB in Oslo, who expects Brent to average $110 a
barrel this quarter.  Brent oil for December settlement rose as much as $1.25 to
$109.64 a barrel and was at $109.29 at 1:03 p.m. on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in London. It earlier fell as much as
0.7 percent to $107.65 a barrel as divisions emerged between
France and  Germany  on the bail-out strategy.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , West Texas
Intermediate crude for December delivery, the most-actively
traded contract, gained 40 cents to $86.51 a barrel. Yesterday
it fell $2.24 to $86.29, the lowest settlement since Oct. 13.
November futures, which expire today, were at $86.51.  Brent Premium  Brent’s premium to WTI narrowed to $22.52 a barrel, having
reached a record of $28.08 on Oct. 14. That spread may narrow to
no less than $12 a barrel to the end of 2013 and possibly
through 2015 because of supply constraints, Bank of America
Corp. said in a report dated yesterday.  Libyan fighters hoisted national flags as they claimed
control of  Muammar Qaddafi ’s hometown of Sirte amid reports that
the deposed dictator had been captured and was injured.  U.S. fuel use fell 2.2 percent to 18.3 million barrels a
day last week, the least since May, the Energy Department said
yesterday in its weekly report. U.S. crude stockpiles dropped
4.73 million barrels to 332.9 million, according to the
department. They were forecast to rise 2 million, according to
the median of 13 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline inventories declined 3.32 million to 206.3
million. They were forecast to slide 1.5 million, according to
the survey. Supplies of distillate fuel, a category that
includes oil and diesel, decreased 4.27 million barrels compared
with an estimate for a 1.5 million decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
