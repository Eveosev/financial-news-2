OAO Sberbank Deputy Chief Executive
Officer Bella Zlatkis said  Russia ’s decision to postpone the
sale of a 7.6 percent stake in the lender wasn’t provoked by the
disclosure of bad loans at OAO Bank of Moscow.  “Rescheduling Sberbank’s privatization is not related to
problems of the Bank of Moscow,” Zlatkis said in an e-mailed
statement from Russia’s biggest lender today.  Sberbank said its statement aimed to “elaborate” on
previous reports. RIA Novosti news agency cited Zlatkis on Oct.
19 as saying that potential Sberbank investors were concerned
that Russian regulators had missed “holes” in Bank of Moscow’s
balance sheet, helping derail the Sberbank privatization.  “We don’t consider that banking control is insufficient or
of bad quality,” Zlatkis said in today’s statement. “We
welcome cleaning of Russian banking system, because it increases
trust to the banks. Nevertheless, I would like to note that any
problems of banks that operate in the public sector affect
Russia’s banking system and raise questions among investors.”  Bank of Moscow, the recipient of the nation’s largest-ever
bailout, and Sberbank are separate entities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
