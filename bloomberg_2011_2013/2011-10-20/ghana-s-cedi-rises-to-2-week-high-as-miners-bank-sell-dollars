Ghana ’s cedi gained for a fourth day
to the highest in almost two weeks as the central bank and
mining companies sold dollars in Africa’s second-biggest gold
producer.  The cedi appreciated as much as 0.6 percent to 1.6194 per
dollar, the highest since Oct. 7, before trading at 1.6212 by
3:35 p.m. in Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Dollar sales from mining companies and the central bank
provided enough liquidity to meet demand,” Kobla Nyaletey, a
currency trader at the local unit of Barclays Bank Plc said in a
telephone interview. “The central bank sold about twice the
normal sales size.”  The Bank of Ghana sold almost $50 million today to support
banks’ clients, including manufacturing, commerce and
telecommunication companies, Collins Antwi, an assistant
director at the treasury department of the bank, said by phone
today. “The central bank has provided adequate liquidity since
the beginning of this month.”  South Africa is the continent’s top gold miner. Companies
including  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  and  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) 
operate in Ghana.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
