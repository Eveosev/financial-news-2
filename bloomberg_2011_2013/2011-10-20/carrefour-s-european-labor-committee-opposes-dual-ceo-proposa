Carrefour SA (CA) ’s European labor
committee rejected a proposal by investor Knight Vinke Asset
Management LLC for two chief executive officers, saying it was
aimed at dismantling the world’s second-largest retailer.  Knight Vinke called yesterday for the French grocer to
split Lars Olofsson’s role of chairman and CEO and suggested it
consider a “twin-headed solution” with one CEO for  France  and
neighboring countries and another for emerging markets.  “Carrefour needs stability and purpose to carry through
its strategy,” Michel Enguelz, European labor committee
secretary, said today in an e-mailed statement. This sort of
proposal “is designed to destabilize the Carrefour group to
make it easier to break up.”  Florence Baranes-Cohen, a spokeswoman for Carrefour,
declined to comment yesterday on Knight Vinke’s open letter to
the grocer’s shareholders, employees and board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
