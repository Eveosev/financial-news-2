PetroChina Co., the country’s
biggest energy producer, fell the most in more than two months
in  Hong Kong  after the official Xinhua News Agency said the
company may post a full-year refining loss.  The shares dropped as much as 5.2 percent, the largest
decline since Aug. 9, and were at HK$9.23 at the midday break,
down 4.9 percent. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  fell 2 percent.  PetroChina may incur a refining loss of 50 billion yuan
($7.8 billion) this year and its annual resource tax payments
may rise to 29 billion yuan, Xinhua reported in headlines,
without saying where it got the information.  The Beijing-based company’s refining segment swung to a
loss of 23.4 billion yuan in the first six months from a profit
a year earlier, according to an Aug. 25 statement. The
government, which controls fuel prices to curb inflation, raised
tariffs by about 10 percent in the first half, while crude in
 New York  averaged 26 percent higher from a year earlier.  China said this month it will replace a volume-based oil
and natural gas tax paid by producers with a value-based tax of
5 percent to 10 percent starting in November.  To contact the reporters on this story:
