Mexico , the world’s sixth-largest
sugar producer, set an import quota for the sweetener of 150,000
metric tons because domestic production may not meet demand.  The quota will expire Jan. 31, 2012, the  Economy Ministry 
said today in the federal gazette. It includes 15,000 tons from
 Nicaragua .  The Economy Ministry approved the extra quota for the start
of the 2011-2012 crop season as record exports to the U.S.
arranged the prior year threatened domestic inventories. The
Mexican government had published another quota for 150,000 tons
in July, and 93,200 tons had been imported so far.  Mexico’s sugar chamber doesn’t expect more imports this
year as the pace of exports has slowed, Juan Cortina, trade
group president said in a Sept. 21 interview. The nation’s Sugar
and Alcohol Chamber of Commerce opposes the new quota.  Mexico, a net exporter of sugar, regulates the industry of
the sweetener by setting import quotas.  In August, there was surplus of sugar in Mexico of 1.2
million tons, according to a  preliminary report  by Conadesuca, a
committee that recommends sugar-import policies for Mexico.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery fell 0.5 percent to
26.83 cents a pound at 11:49 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York , heading for a second straight loss. The sweetener jumped
11 percent last week after floods delayed the harvest in
 Thailand , the world’s second-largest exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
