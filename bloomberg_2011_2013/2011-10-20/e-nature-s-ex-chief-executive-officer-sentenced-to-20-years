Former Le-Nature’s Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Gregory J. Podlucky was sentenced to 20 years
in prison for fraud,  tax evasion  and money-laundering related to
the 2006 collapse of the bottled-water company.  Podlucky was the mastermind behind a scheme that cost
lenders, shareholders and others, $684.5 million, Assistant U.S.
Attorney James Y. Garrett said in court papers filed today.
Podlucky was sentenced today in U.S. District Court in
Pittsburgh to the maximum allowed under a plea agreement,
Garrett said in an interview.  “Whether or not defendant’s conduct should be deplored as
evil, the ingenuity, industry and magnitude of his extraordinary
crimes are plain to see,” Garrett said in court papers.  Podlucky attacked the “Achilles’ heel” of the financial
system “with an elegant fabric of deceit woven of forged
documents and the connivance of a handful of accomplices.”  Podlucky’s brother Jonathan and at least three other Le-
Nature’s employees also pleaded guilty to charges related to the
fraud, according to court papers.  Alexander H. Lindsay Jr., Podlucky’s attorney, didn’t
immediately return a call for comment on the sentence.  Some of the money was used to buy gems, watches and toy
trains, which investigators found in a secret room at the
company’s Latrobe,  Pennsylvania , bottling plant, according to
court records.  Le-Nature’s filed for bankruptcy in 2006 and was
liquidated.  The case is U.S. v. Podlucky, 2:09-cr-00279, U.S. District
Court, Western District of Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh).  To contact the reporter on this story:
