Greek police used tear gas to
disperse protesters during the second day of a 48-hour strike in
central Athens today as hooded youths attacked demonstrators
encircling Parliament House.  The group of about 200 youths threw stones and fire bombs
at the Communist Party of Greece-backed PAME union demonstrators
who had formed a ring around the assembly early in the morning
to protest against Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s latest
austerity measures. The bill is being debated in the chamber,
with a vote due at some point later today.  Police estimated that 50,000 people gathered in the city
center in the second straight day of protests against
Papandreou’s pension and wage cuts. Papandreou says the measures
are necessary to secure an 8 billion-euro ($11 billion) loan
payment from international creditors and avert default.  To contact the reporters on this story:
