Swedish unemployment rose less than
estimated in September as the central bank kept its benchmark
rate unchanged as growth in the largest Nordic economy slows.  The non-seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, based on a
survey of about 29,500 people, rose to 6.8 percent from 6.6
percent the previous month, Stockholm-based  Statistics Sweden 
said today in a statement. The rate was 7.8 percent a year
earlier. The median estimate of fifteen economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for the rate to rise to 7 percent.  Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell to 7.2 percent in
September from 7.4 percent the previous month.  Swedenâ€™s central bank on Sept. 7 raised kept its key
 interest rate  at 2 percent after seven consecutive increases
from a record-low 0.25 percent in July last year. It raised its
2011 growth forecast to 4.5 percent and predicted the expansion
will slow to 1.7 percent next year, as exports will suffer from
the global economic slowdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
