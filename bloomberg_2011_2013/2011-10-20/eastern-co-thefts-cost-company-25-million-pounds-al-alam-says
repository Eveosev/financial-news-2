Eastern Co. (EAST) , Egypt’s monopoly
cigarette producer, has lost products valued at 25 million
Egyptian pounds ($4.2 million)  since January because its
delivery vehicles have been subjected to armed robberies, Al
 Alam Al Youm  reported.  The company is also losing market share because of the
increase in smuggling of foreign cigarettes that are sold at a
higher profit margin than their local counterparts, the Cairo-
based newspaper said, citing Eastern’s marketing manager,
Mohamed Othman.  -- Editor:  Chris Peterson   To contact the reporter on this story:
