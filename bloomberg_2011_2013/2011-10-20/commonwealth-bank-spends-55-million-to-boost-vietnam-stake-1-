Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the
nation’s biggest lender, will pay 1.15 trillion dong
($55 million) for an additional 5 percent stake in  Vietnam 
International Commercial Joint-Stock Bank.  The purchase, approved by regulators in July, will increase
Commonwealth’s stake to 20 percent, the maximum allowed for a
foreign investor, from 15 percent, the Vietnamese lender known
as VIB said in a statement published at a briefing in Hanoi
today.  “Despite the short-term difficulties, Vietnam’s banking
system is still very attractive to foreign investors from a
strategic point of view, on the long-term horizon,” said Attila Vajda, Ho Chi Minh City-based head of institutional clients at
ACB Securities Co.  VIB aims to use the investment to improve  customer service 
and risk management, Chairman Han Ngoc Vu said at the press
conference. In addition to Commonwealth, other lenders seeking
to tap credit demand in Vietnam include  Singapore ’s United
Overseas Bank Ltd., which last month increased its stake in
Southern Commercial Joint-Stock Bank to 19.99 percent.  “It’s also good for the banking sector when such
investment happens, as it adds very valuable know-how to the
local banks, especially in areas such as risk management,
product development, channel management and credit
assessments,” Vajda said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
