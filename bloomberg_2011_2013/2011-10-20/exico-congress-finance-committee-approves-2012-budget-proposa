The Finance Committee in  Mexico ’s
lower house of Congress approved an initiative for the 2012
budget that would raise the nation’s deficit to 0.4 percent of
gross domestic product from the government’s initial proposal of
0.2 percent.  The bill, which will now go to the floor of the lower
house, would lower the official forecast for Mexico’s 2012
economic growth to 3.3 percent from 3.5 percent while
maintaining an estimated price of $84.9 per barrel for oil
exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
