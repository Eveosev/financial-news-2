of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas  monetary policy  decisions.  The bank targets overnight borrowing rate which is the rate at
which it borrows overnight from commercial lenders.  Since Bloomberg started surveys for the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
in September 2005, there have been a total of 105 rate decisions by the
bank, of which 9 were unexpected, resulting in the survey matching the
actual rate decision 84.5% of the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
