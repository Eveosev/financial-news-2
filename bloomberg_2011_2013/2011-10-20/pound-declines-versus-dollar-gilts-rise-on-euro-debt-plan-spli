The pound fell against the euro and
gilts declined on optimism progress is being made in agreeing a
plan to end the European debt crisis.  Sterling weakened versus most of its 16 major peers tracked
by Bloomberg as draft guidelines showed changes to the euro
region’s revamped bailout fund that will be hammered out at a
summit this weekend may open the door to “massive” credit
lines for countries like Italy and  Spain . Gilts declined for a
second day after a report showed retail sales, including fuel,
unexpectedly rose the most in five months in September.  “Expectations have been lowered so much that any sign of
progress is seen as good news, so we’ve seen the euro
rebounding” against the pound, said  Ian Stannard , London-based
head of European currency strategy at Morgan Stanley. “Any
positive European news is going to see euro-sterling moving up
towards the top end of the range.”  The pound weakened 0.3 percent to 87.53 pence per euro at
11:47 a.m.  London  time. It erased declines against the U.S. and
Japanese currencies to trade little changed at $1.5790 and
121.31 yen.  The pound has slid 1 percent in the past six months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which
measure a basket of 10 developed-market currencies. It has
gained 3.1 percent against the euro since the start of the
second half as officials struggle to agree on a resolution to
the area’s debt crisis.  Precautionary Aid  The enhanced fund, called the European Financial Stability
Facility, may be able to offer loans worth up to 10 percent of a
member state’s gross domestic product in precautionary aid
“before they face difficulties raising funds” in bond markets,
the draft obtained by Bloomberg News shows.  The 10-year gilt yield rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.49 percent. The 3.75 percent security
maturing September 2021 declined 0.185, or 1.85 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 110.98. The two-year note yield was
little changed at 0.59 percent.  The U.K. sold 4.75 billion pounds of 1.75 percent
securities maturing in January 2017 at an average yield of 1.547
percent, the Debt Management Office said. That’s up from 1.394
percent at the previous auction on Sept. 22. Demand rose to 1.7
times the amount of securities on offer, from 1.2 times.  Retail sales including fuel rose 0.6 percent from August,
when they fell a revised 0.4 percent, the  Office for National
Statistics  said today in London. That’s the biggest gain since
April and compares with the median forecast of 23 economists in
a Bloomberg survey for no change.  U.K. government debt has handed investors 12 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies, surpassing
the 6.7 percent gain for German bunds and 8 percent return for
 U.S. Treasuries .  To contact the reporter on this story:
