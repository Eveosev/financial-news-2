Slovak lawmakers approved a new bank
tax from next year as the country seeks to cut the  budget
deficit  and build reserves against any future bank crisis.  Deputies in Bratislava,  Slovakia , today backed the bill
calling for a 0.4 percent levy on banks’ liabilities, excluding
insured deposits, according to parliament’s website.  The proceeds from the tax will be used to cover costs of
any future financial-market turbulence in the eastern European
country. Unlike some of its peers, banks in Slovakia, which are
mostly subsidiaries of foreign lenders such Austria’s  Erste
Group Bank AG (EBS) , didn’t need aid from the state during the global
financial crisis.  The tax is one of the measures to help trim the budget
deficit and may raise about 80 million euros ($111 million) a
year, according to a Finance Ministry projection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
