Ithaca Energy Inc. (IAE) , a  North Sea  oil
explorer and producer, acquired Challenger Minerals (North Sea)
Ltd. from Transocean Drilling U.K. Ltd. for $35 million.  The transaction increases Ithacaâ€™s stakes in the Stella and
Harrier fields and gives it a non-operated interest in the
producing Broom field, the Calgary-based company said today in a
statement.  Ithaca also said it agreed to divest a stake in the
Hurricane field to Dyas U.K. Ltd. It has signed a contract
letter of intent to secure a rig to drill an appraisal well at
Hurricane in early 2012, the company said in a separate
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
