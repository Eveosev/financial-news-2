Schneider Electric SA (SU)  Chief
Financial Officer Emmanuel Babeau expects raw material costs to
increase by about 400 million euros this year.  A recent decline in raw material costs will provide
“extremely limited” relief in 2011 because the company hedges
some of its purchases over three months on average, and there is
a time lag between purchases and sales, the CFO said on a
conference call today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
