U.S. stock-index futures trimmed
gains after claims remained at a level that shows little
improvement in the labor market.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December climbed 0.4 percent to 1,211.2 at 8:33 a.m. in  New York 
after rising as much as 0.8 percent earlier.  Jobless claims dropped by 6,000 to 403,000 in the week
ended Oct. 15, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
called for a drop to 400,000 applications. The four-week average
fell to the lowest level since April.       Earlier gains in futures followed better-than-estimated
earnings and new details about plans to enhance the European
bailout fund, including a potential boost to credit lines for
some of the region’s most-indebted nations.  U.S. stocks dropped yesterday after France and  Germany 
split on the role of the  European Central Bank  in leveraging the
European Financial Stability Facility, the region’s rescue fund.
The euro area’s finance ministers, under pressure to craft a
solution to their region’s debt crisis, meet in Brussels
tomorrow before a full summit two days later.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
