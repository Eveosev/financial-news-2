Efforts to resolve the euro region’s
sovereign debt crisis may have more influence on the direction
of U.S. stocks than the latest economic releases and corporate
earnings reports.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, the relationship between
daily swings in the euro and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is
the closest since the European currency was introduced in 1999.
That’s based on correlations for the previous 60 trading days.  “Investors have their eyes squarely focused on European
developments,” Myles Zyblock, chief institutional strategist at
 RBC Capital Markets , wrote yesterday in a report that included a
similar chart. “The economy is taking a back seat.”  The correlation coefficient between the euro and the  S&P
500  was 0.74 yesterday. Readings can be as high as 1 when two
values move in lockstep, or as low as minus 1 when they head in
opposite directions consistently.  Stocks are poised to fall unless European policy makers
“put something concrete and credible on the table” by Nov. 4,
according to Zyblock, based in Toronto. Euro-area leaders will
meet Oct. 23 in Brussels and global leaders are set to hold a
Group of 20 summit on Nov. 3-4 in Cannes,  France .  “We have very little faith that a solution to the
sovereign crisis will be found” any time soon, he wrote. He
recommended sticking with defensive stocks, or the shares of
companies least affected by the economy’s swings. Health-care
companies and makers of food, beverages and other consumer
staples are among his industry picks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
