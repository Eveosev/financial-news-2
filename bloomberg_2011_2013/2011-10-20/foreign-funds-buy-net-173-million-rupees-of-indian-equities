Overseas investors bought a net 173
million rupees ($3.5 million) of Indian equities yesterday,
paring their outflow from equities this year to 9.67 billion
rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners bought 17.76 billion rupees of shares and sold
17.59 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They bought a net 2.6 billion rupees of bonds,
taking total flows into debt this year to 195.8 billion rupees.  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index has dropped 17.4 percent this
year, on concern a slowdown in the U.S. and  Europe ’s debt crisis
may erode company profits already threatened by the most
aggressive interest-rate increases among major Asian economies.  Overseas funds withdrew a net $2.4 billion from Indian
stocks in August, the most since October 2008, the data show.
That caused the Sensex to drop 8.4 percent that month, making
the gauge’s worst August in at least a decade, according to
Bloomberg data.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fourth-biggest,
is influenced by foreign fund flows. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record $29.4 billion in 2010, making the Sensex the best
performer among the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever
outflow in 2008 led the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreign funds have placed 4.461 trillion rupees in stocks
and 982.4 billion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
