U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin said caps on debit-card “swipe” fees mandated by the
Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law don’t hurt the economy.  “There is no evidence” the rules have “any real effect
on the macroeconomy,” Wolin said in an interview with CNBC
today. “It is one provision among many.”  The Federal Reserve imposed rules Oct. 1 limiting the fees
card networks charge merchants to 21 cents per transaction,
about half what retailers had been paying. In response, lenders
including  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  have been
rolling out new charges for debit customers to make up some of
the $8 billion the largest banks may lose under the rules.  Some Republicans, including Alabama Representative  Spencer
Bachus , who leads the House Financial Services Committee, are
asking for an overhaul of Dodd-Frank, which they say hurts
businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
