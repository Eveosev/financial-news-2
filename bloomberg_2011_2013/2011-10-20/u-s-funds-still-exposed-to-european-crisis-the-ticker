The U.S. financial sector is gradually severing its links with an increasingly troubled  Europe , but the pace probably isn’t fast enough to prevent contagion if things go terribly wrong. The money-market funds that hold about $1.5 trillion in U.S. savings would be among the first to suffer if Europe's sovereign-debt problems bring down its banking system. That's because the funds have invested heavily in the debt of European banks -- a fact Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  has publicly noted in assessing the potential repercussions of a European meltdown. The managers of money-market funds recognize the risk, and have been paring their European exposure.  Fitch Ratings  estimates that as of September, 37.7 percent of all money-market assets were invested in European banks, down from 51.5 percent in May. Still, that leaves the funds' exposure to Europe at more than $500 billion. Even a small loss on such an amount could force a fund to "break the buck," bringing the share price below $1 as the Reserve Primary Fund did after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings in September 2008. That, in turn, could trigger a run on the funds by investors, crippling short-term lending markets on which companies rely for such everyday activities as buying supplies and paying their workers. In other words, the U.S. and other countries outside Europe still have a lot to lose if European leaders don’t resolve their crisis. (Mark Whitehouse is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board)
