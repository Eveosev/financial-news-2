Gafisa SA (GFSA3)  fell the most in more than
two weeks as homebuilders declined after traders pared bets for
lower borrowing costs in  Brazil  following the central bank’s
decision to cut the benchmark rate by a half percentage point.  Gafisa dropped 5.2 percent to 5.83 reais at the close of
trading, the most since Oct. 3. It had gained 9.2 percent in the
previous two sessions. The  BM&FBovespa Real Estate (IMOBBV)  index fell
2.6 percent.  Brazil’s central bank, led by President Alexandre Tombini,
voted unanimously yesterday to reduce the benchmark Selic rate
to 11.5 percent from 12 percent, quelling speculation it would
accelerate the pace of cuts.  “Homebuilders rose in the past few days because they were
pricing in a cut bigger than 0.5 point,” Fabio Cardoso, a
partner at Rio de Janeiro-based equity advisory firm Adinvest
Consultoria, said in a telephone interview today. “It didn’t
happen, so they erased part of those gains.”  Policy makers said in a statement yesterday that a
“moderate adjustment” in the Selic rate “is consistent” with
the goal of bringing inflation to target by 2012. The statement
signals the central bank won’t accelerate the pace of cuts,
Carlos Thadeu de Freitas Gomes Filho, chief economist at
Franklin Templeton Investments in  Sao Paulo , said in a telephone
interview.  Yields on most Brazilian interest-rate futures contracts
rose today. Yields on the contract due in January 2013 climbed
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 10.50 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
