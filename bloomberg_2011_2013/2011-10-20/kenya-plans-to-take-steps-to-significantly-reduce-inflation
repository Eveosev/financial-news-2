Kenya plans to take steps to
“significantly” reduce inflation, President Mwai Kibaki said.  The East African nation plans to remove duties on imported
staple foods, Kibaki said, according to an e-mailed copy of a
speech from his Nairobi-based office. The country also intends
to subsidize fertilizers and will establish a fertilizer and
seeds fund, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
