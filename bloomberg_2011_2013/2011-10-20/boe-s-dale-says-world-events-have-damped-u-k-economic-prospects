Bank of England Chief Economist
 Spencer Dale  said the economy hasn’t grown as fast as policy
makers expected and global events have damped the outlook, the
Oldham Chronicle reported, citing an interview.   The U.K. economy “had not been growing as quickly as we
wanted it to grow, but it had been growing,” Dale, a member of
the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, told the
newspaper. “Over the last few months what has been going on in
the rest of the world has started to dampen those prospects.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
