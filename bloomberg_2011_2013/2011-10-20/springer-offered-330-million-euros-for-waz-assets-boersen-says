Axel Springer AG (SPR)  offered 300 million
euros ($411 million) to 330 million euros for some WAZ Media

with the bid.  The offer compares with an internal valuation of less than
500 million euros at the beginning of the month, the newspaper
said.  The publisher doesnâ€™t plan to increase the offer, which
includes the Kronen-Zeitung and Kurier newspapers as well as
television guides and some online portals, Boersen-Zeitung said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
