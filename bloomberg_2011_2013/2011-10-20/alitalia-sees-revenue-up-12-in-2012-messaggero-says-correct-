(Corrects to add newspaper reference in headline.)  Alitalia  expects to increase revenue
by as much as 12 percent next year, Il Messaggero said, without
saying where it got the information.  Air-France KLM put off a plan to integrate Alitalia into a
common holding company, the Italian newspaper said, citing a
letter of the former Chief Executive Officer Pierre-Henri
Gourgeon to Air France managers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
