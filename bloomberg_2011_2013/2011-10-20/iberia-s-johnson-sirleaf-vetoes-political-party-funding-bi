Liberian President Ellen Johnson- Sirleaf vetoed a bill recently passed by lawmakers that sought
to give budget support for political parties in the country.  The policy discriminates against people who are not members
of political parties, Johnson-Sirleaf said in a  statement  on the
presidency’s website.  The funding plan, which called for about $4 million to be
distributed to political parties based on their election
results, would be difficult for the West African nation to
afford given its “scarce and limited financial resources,”
according to the statement dated yesterday.  Johnson-Sirleaf is vying for a second term in office and
will run against Winston Tubman in a second round election
scheduled for Nov. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
