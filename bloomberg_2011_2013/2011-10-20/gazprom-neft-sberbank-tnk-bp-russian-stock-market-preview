The following companies may be
active in Russian trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses and
share prices are from the previous close.  The 30-stock Micex Index fell 0.1 percent to 1,418.85. The
dollar-denominated RTS Index sank 1.1 percent to 1,423.03.  OAO Gazprom Neft (SIBN RX): The company’s board approved
plans to sell 60 billion rubles ($1.9 billion) of 10-year bonds,
according to regulatory filings. The Russian oil producer,
controlled by the country’s natural-gas export monopoly,
increased 2.2 percent to 125.75 rubles.  OAO Sberbank (SBER03 RX): The ruble depreciated against the
dollar for the third day this week as disagreements over
 Europe ’s rescue strategy curbed demand for riskier assets. A
weaker ruble encourages Russians to withdraw and convert ruble
deposits, Sberbank’s main source of funding. Sberbank gained 0.3
percent to 80.92 rubles.  OAO  TNK-BP Holding (TNBP)  : Deputy Chief Executive
Officer Maxim Barsky told colleagues that he will leave the
company, Interfax said, citing unidentified people. TNK-BP
declined to comment, the report said. The Russian oil and gas
producer, half owned by BP Plc, was little changed at 79 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
