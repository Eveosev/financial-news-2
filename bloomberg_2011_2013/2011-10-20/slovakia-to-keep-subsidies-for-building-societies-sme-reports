Slovak lawmakers rejected cutting
state subsidies for clients of building societies,  Sme  newspaper
reported, citing voting results from parliament.  Deputies yesterday rejected cutting the maximum annual
subsidy to 15 euros ($21) per client from the current 66 euros,
the newspaper said. The change was proposed by the  Finance
Ministry  and it was meant to cut budget expenditures by 33
million euros from 2013, Sme said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
