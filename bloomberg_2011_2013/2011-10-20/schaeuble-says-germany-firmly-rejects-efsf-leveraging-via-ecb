German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said there should be “no doubt” that  Chancellor
Angela Merkel ’s government rejects leveraging the European
Financial Stability Facility’s firepower by giving it access to
European Central Bank refinancing.  A working group of euro region finance ministries is in
“intensive negotiations” about leveraging the EFSF, Schaeuble
told reporters in Berlin.  Germany  will not increase its guarantees for the EFSF,
which amount to 211 billion euros, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
