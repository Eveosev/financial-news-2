U.S. feedlots probably bought fewer
cattle last month as a Texas drought reduced the number of
available animals, signaling tight beef supplies, record meat
prices and higher costs for restaurants such as  Sonic Corp. (SONC)   Purchases probably fell 3.2 percent to 2.385 million head
of cattle from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of 10 analysts. The government will report inventories at
3 p.m. in  Washington . In the 12 months ended Oct. 1, Texas, the
leading beef producer, had the driest period since records began
in 1895.  This week, cattle futures for December delivery rose to
$1.24475 a pound in Chicago, a record for the most-active
contract. Sonic, a drive-in hamburger chain, said that beef was
one of the “primary cost drivers” in the quarter ended Aug.
31. Ground beef jumped to $2.868 a pound in September, the
highest since at least 1984.  “Because of drought, we’re going to have fewer cattle for
the next several years,” Tim Petry, a livestock economist at
North Dakota State University in Fargo, said in a telephone
interview. Lower placements at feedlots last month “should be
the start of a trend that will ultimately go to lower beef
production,” he said.  Fed-steer prices next year may average $1.22 a pound, up
6.1 percent from a projection of $1.15 a pound in 2011, an all-
time high, Petry said. Record prices may extend into 2013,
averaging $1.27 a pound, he said.  Annual Rallies  Cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have
climbed 13 percent this year after surging 26 percent in 2010.
U.S. consumers may pay 9 percent more for beef in 2011, more
than any other food group, the government has forecast. The
December futures rose 0.3 percent to settle at $1.2215 a pound
today.  More than 72 percent of  Texas  is in “exceptional”
drought, according to the University of  Nebraska ’s U.S. Drought
 Monitor . In June and July, producers sent cattle to feedlots
earlier than normal and in larger numbers, government data show.  Feedlots in the U.S. buy year-old cattle that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. It takes
about four or five months on a diet of mostly corn before the
animals weigh about 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to
meatpackers.  Feeder-Cattle Record  Feeder-cattle futures, which reached a record $1.4875 a
pound today, have climbed 32 percent in the past 12 months.  The total feedlot herd on Oct. 1 probably totaled 11.229
million head, up 4.1 percent from a year earlier, according to
the Bloomberg survey. Producers sold about 1.811 million
fattened cattle to slaughterhouses in September, up 0.5 percent
from a year earlier, analysts said.  Stephen C. Vaughan, the chief financial officer of Oklahoma
City-based Sonic, said on a conference call on Oct. 18 that the
company plans to make a “small price increase this fall.” The
latest earnings trailed estimates by analysts, and the shares
have slumped 33 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
