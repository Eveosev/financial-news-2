Jonathan Trott  and Samit Patel
combined for 103 runs to push England to 298-4 at the end of its
innings in the third one-day international with  India .  Trott finished on 98 runs and Patel on 70 at the end of the
visitorsâ€™ 50 overs in Mohali, India.  Kevin Pietersen  scored 64
as England won the toss and elected to bat, recovering from the
loss of Captain Alastair Cook for 3.  India has won the first two one-day matches of the series
at home after a winless tour of England this summer. It was 
swept in a four-match Test series and also lost a one-day
series 3-0 and a Twenty20 match.  England  and India have two more
one-day games, in Mumbai and Kolkata, and one Twenty20 game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
