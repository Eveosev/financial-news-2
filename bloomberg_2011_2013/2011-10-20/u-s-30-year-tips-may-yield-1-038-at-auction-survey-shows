The government’s auction of $7
billion of 30-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities may
draw a record low yield of 1.038 percent, according to eight of
the  Federal Reserve ’s 22 primary dealers in a Bloomberg News
survey.  The sale is the fifth 30-year TIPS offering since auctions
of the security were resumed in February 2010 after the Treasury
stopped selling them in 2001. The bonds will mature in February
2041. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York time.  The securities yielded a record low 1.744 percent at the
last offering, on June 23. The sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 3.02, versus an average of 2.7 at the four auctions
since sales resumed.  Indirect bidders, a category of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 23.3 percent of the securities at
the June sale, compared with an average of 40 percent at the
past four auctions.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 26.1 percent of
the securities at the last sale, versus a 16 percent average at
the past four auctions.  Inflation-indexed notes pay interest at lower rates than
nominal Treasuries on a principal amount that’s linked to the
Labor Department’s consumer price index. TIPS overall have
returned 11 percent in 2011, compared with 7.9 percent for
conventional Treasuries, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
