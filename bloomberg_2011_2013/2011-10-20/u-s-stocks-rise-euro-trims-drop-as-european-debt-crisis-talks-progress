U.S. stocks rose, erasing earlier
losses, as the leaders of France and  Germany  said they asked
euro-region officials to agree on a plan to tame the region’s
debt crisis by Oct. 26 at the latest. The euro and commodities
trimmed declines and 10-year Treasuries reversed gains.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent to 1,212.4
at 1:29 p.m. in  New York  after tumbling as much as 1 percent.
The euro was down less than 0.2 percent at $1.3735, trimming a
0.8 percent slide, and 10-year Treasury yields rose two basis
points to 2.19 percent after decreasing as much as five basis
points. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities lost 0.6 percent,
recovering from a 1.9 percent decline.  Riskier assets rebounded from their lows of the session as
the joint statement by the French and German governments said
European leaders will hold a second summit next week after the
one scheduled for Oct. 23. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  agreed to ask euro-region
leaders to assess the "comprehensive and ambitious" package in
order to agree on the plans by Oct. 26 at the latest.  Earlier losses in stocks, commodities and the euro came
amid growing concern leaders were gridlocked on plans to
leverage the region’s bailout fund.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
