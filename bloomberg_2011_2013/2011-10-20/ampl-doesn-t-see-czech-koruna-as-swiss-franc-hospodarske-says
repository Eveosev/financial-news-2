The Czech koruna is unlikely to
become a global reserve currency in the “foreseeable future,”
 Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing central bank Vice-Governor
Mojmir Hampl.  Hampl says it’s hard to imagine that the  Czech Republic

a limit rate for the franc to cap its strength, the newspaper
cited him as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
