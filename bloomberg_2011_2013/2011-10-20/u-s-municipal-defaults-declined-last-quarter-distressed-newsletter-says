U.S. municipal defaults fell last
quarter as local governments reduced expenses instead of
forgoing payments on debt, bucking banking analyst  Meredith Whitney ’s forecast for a surge in failures.  There were 12 defaults in the period, totaling
$126 million, a decline from 18 in the same quarter last year
and 24 in the same three months of 2009, according to the
Distressed Debt Securities Newsletter.  For the first nine months of 2011, defaults totaled
$949 million, about a tenth of the amount of failures in
corporate debt, according to the newsletter, published by  Miami
Lakes , Florida-based Income Securities Advisor Inc.  Whitney’s prediction “was based on the premise that
municipalities will experience a budget crunch as tax receipts
declined and expenses increase,” the report said. “This is
happening, but instead of defaulting on bonds, municipalities
are cutting expenses.”  Municipalities nationwide are still dealing with fiscal
strains in the wake of the 18-month recession that ended in June
2009. Central Falls,  Rhode Island , sought Chapter 9 bankruptcy
protection on Aug. 1, and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, filed this
month.  Whitney said on the “60 Minutes” television show in
December that the next 12 months would see “hundreds of billions
of dollars” of defaults.  To contact the reporter on this story:
