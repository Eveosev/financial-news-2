Cyprus’s  finance ministry  drafted
two bills to shield the island’s banks from financial
instability, Stockwatch reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  The first will allow the government to extend loans or
guarantees to a bank or increase its capital to help avert
systemic risk, Web-based Stockwatch said today.  The second bill provides for the establishment and
operation of an independent financial stability fund, Stockwatch
said.  Click here for web link   To contact the reporter on this story:
