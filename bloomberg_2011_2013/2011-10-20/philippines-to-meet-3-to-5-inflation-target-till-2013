 The  Philippines  will meet its
inflation target of between 3 percent and 5 percent this year
till 2013, central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said in  Manila 
today.  Inflation this year will likely average 4.46 percent, 3.05
percent in 2012 and 3 percent in 2013, central bank Deputy
Governor Diwa Guinigundo said. Monthly inflation this year wonâ€™t
exceed 5 percent, Guinigundo said.  The central bank said inflation outlook is slightly tilted
on the downside as commodity prices ease.  To contact the reporter on this story:
