Ajinkya Rahane’s 91 runs and a 65-
run partnership from captain MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja gave
 India  a 5-wicket victory over England in the third one-day
international cricket match.  The win means India has an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the five-
match series. The visitors finished on 298-4, and looked in
control in Mohali, India, before Dhoni came in to bat. The
captain won the match with a four that pushed India to 300-5
with 4 balls remaining.  The hosts are looking to revenge a winless tour of England
earlier this year. They were swept in a four-match Test series
and also lost a one-day series 3-0 and a Twenty20 match. England
and India have two more one-day games, in Mumbai and Kolkata,
and one Twenty20 game.  India benefited from 17 extras and several miscues from
England wicketkeeper  Craig Kieswetter , who dropped Virat Kohli
and failed to run out Jadeja when he stepped on the stumps
before he could bring his gloves down.  England won the toss, and elected to bat.  Jonathan Trott ,
on 98 not out, and Samit Patel, 70 unbeaten, combined for 103
runs at the end of the visitors’ 50 overs.  Kevin Pietersen 
scored 64 to help England recover from the loss of Captain
Alastair Cook for 3.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
