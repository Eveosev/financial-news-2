Russia’s international currency and
gold reserves jumped $7.3 billion last week, the most since
April 2010, after the euro strengthened against the dollar.  The stockpile, the world’s third largest, reached $517.7
billion on Oct. 14, the first advance in six weeks, the Moscow-
based bank said in a statement today.  The increase was mostly caused by a strengthening euro,
which accounts for more than 40 percent of reserves, Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at Moscow-based Otkritie Capital,
said today in an e-mailed research note. Excluding revaluations,
reserves probably fell by $800 million, he said.  The revaluation of euro-denominated assets accounted for
$6.4 billion of last week’s gain, according to Tikhomirov. The
euro surged 3.8 percent against the dollar to 1.3882 from 1.3378
last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
