Ivan Nova and Freddy Garcia were
added as starters to complete the pitching rotation for the  New
York Yankees .  Nova and Garcia join CC Sabathia, A.J. Burnett and Phil Hughes in the rotation, Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  said
yesterday. Bartolo Colon was sent to the bullpen.  In 10 games, including seven starts, for the Yankees last
season, Nova went 1-2 with a 4.50 earned run average. Garcia had
a 12-6 record with a 4.64 ERA for the Chicago White Sox last
year.  Reliever Pedro Feliciano has a sore upper left arm and may
start the Major League Baseball season on the disabled list.
Girardi said a determination will be made March 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
