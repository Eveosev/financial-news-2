LTX-Credence Corp. (LTXCD)  terminated plans
to buy  Verigy Ltd. (VRGY)  after accepting a $15 million payment to end
the agreement.  The termination fee was received March 25, LTX-Credence
said today in a statement. The board of Verigy, which makes
chip-testing equipment, said last week that it preferred an
offer from rival  Advantest Corp. (6857)   Advantest’s December bid of $15 a share in cash was
“superior” to the all-stock agreement Verigy signed with LTX-
Credence in November, Verigy’s board said March 21.  LTX-Credence, based in Milpitas,  California , declined to
make a counteroffer for Singapore-based Verigy by a March 25
deadline.  Advantest, based in  Tokyo , makes testing equipment for
memory chips.  To contact the reporter on this story:
