The Australian dollar rose for a
seventh day versus the U.S. currency in the longest stretch of
advances this year as evidence of a global economic recovery
spurred demand for higher-yielding currencies.  The Aussie touched a record as the Australian opposition’s
victory in New South Wales state elections may signal a growing
backlash over Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s taxes on carbon
emissions and mining profits. New Zealand’s dollar fluctuated
after Prime Minister John Key said the nation may post a record
budget deficit because of costs arising from last month’s quake.  “In terms of the Australian dollar, investors prefer to
look at the glass half full,” said  Samarjit Shankar , a managing
director of the foreign-exchange group in Boston at Bank of  New
York  Mellon Corp., the world’s largest custodial bank, with more
than $20 trillion in assets under administration. “Economic
growth in general is not going to be derailed.”  Australia ’s dollar gained 0.1 percent to $1.0274 at 1:53
p.m. in New York, from $1.0260 on March 25. It touched $1.0315,
the highest level since the currency was freely floated in 1983.
The Aussie rose 0.6 percent to 83.99 yen.  New Zealand ’s dollar
was little changed at 75.35 U.S. cents and appreciated 0.5
percent to 61.58 yen.  The Liberal-National coalition and its leader in
Australia’s most populous state, Barry O’Farrell, joined those
elected in Western Australia and Victoria since 2008 who opposed
Gillard’s plans to price carbon emissions from next year and
place a 30 percent tax on  iron ore  and coal profits.  Commodities including iron ore and dairy products make up
more than half of exports for Australia and New Zealand.  New Zealand exports grew to NZ$3.50 billion
($2.64 billion), and imports increased to NZ$3.30 billion in
February, according to the median forecast of 12 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey before a report from  Statistics New
Zealand . Exports totaled NZ$3.29 billion and imports totaled
NZ$3.28 billion in the prior month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
