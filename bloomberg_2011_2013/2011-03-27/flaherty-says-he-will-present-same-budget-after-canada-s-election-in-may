Canadian Finance Minister James Flaherty said he will re-introduce the same fiscal plan he
tabled last week if his government wins the federal election on
May 2.  “We will present the same budget to Parliament,
certainly” Flaherty told reporters at the Inter-American
Development Bank annual meeting yesterday in Calgary.
“Depending on timing there might have to be an update of
economic data in the budget. Fundamentally it would be the same
document updated if necessary.”  Canada’s minority Conservative government was dissolved
after opposition parties voted to find it in contempt of
Parliament. No vote was held on the budget Flaherty tabled March
22.  Flaherty said he will leave the economic meeting, which had
been planned over a year ago, to begin campaigning in his
Ontario riding today. He predicted that opposition parties,
which have denied they will attempt to form a coalition
government if any party fails to get a majority, will reverse
their position after the election.  “They did it before unsuccessfully,” Flaherty said. “I
suspect they have to face the reality that they would probably
have to try to form some sort of formal or informal coalition if
they were able to do so following another election. That’s what
happened in 2008.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
