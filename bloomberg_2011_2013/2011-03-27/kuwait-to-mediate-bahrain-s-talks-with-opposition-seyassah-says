Officials from  Bahrain ’s largest
opposition party Al-Wefaq will discuss a Kuwaiti initiative to
mediate between the Bahraini government and its opponents,  Al-
Seyassah  reported, without saying where it got the information.  The delegates arrive in  Kuwait  today to discuss the
mediation talks, which would be headed by Kuwait’s Speaker of
the Parliament Jassim al-Kharafi, the newspaper reported.
Bahrain’s Shiite-led opposition has accepted Kharafi’s terms
that it not insist on the resignation of the Bahraini prime
minister or make any demands on the Persian Gulf nation’s Sunni
ruler King Hamad Bin Isa or his family, according to the Kuwait-
based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
