Israeli 10-year government bond
yields climbed to the highest level on record on bets the
central bank will increase interest rates for a third month
tomorrow to halt inflation.  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer , who last month
raised the interest rate to 2.5 percent, likely will lift the
rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.75 percent at the next
policy-setting meeting, according to 15 of 20 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. One expects an increase to 3 percent and four
predict the rate will remain at 2.5 percent. The bank will
announce its decision at 5:30 p.m. in Jerusalem tomorrow.  “There is room for yields to increase further as inflation
expectations in the  capital market  are still high and the
central bank may need to continue with a series of rate hikes,”
Shuki Arditi, a bond trader at Leader Capital Markets Ltd. in
 Tel Aviv , said by telephone.  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit due January 2020 fell,
pushing the yield up 3 basis points to 5.32 percent at 12:06
p.m. in Tel Aviv, the highest since the bond was issued in
November 2009.  Fischer has increased the benchmark rate for two
consecutive months to combat rising prices. Inflation, which
quickened to 4.2 percent in February, will increase 3.1 percent
in the next 12 months, according to the average forecast in a
Bank of Israel poll released March 22.  The shekel strengthened 0.1 percent to 3.5581 per dollar on
March 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
