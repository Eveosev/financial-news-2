Bankinter SA (BKT)  Chief Executive
Officer Maria Dolores Dancausa said she sees remote chances of
purchasing a savings bank or “caja” as it bets on organic
growth to achieve profit growth of 20 percent in 2011,  El Pais 
reported today.  “Chances are very small, remote,” Dancausa told the
newspaper in an interview. “I don’t see synergies with the
cajas.”  She reiterated the company’s goal of boosting net income by
20 percent this year, according to El Pais. Bankinter isn’t up
for sale, she also said, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
