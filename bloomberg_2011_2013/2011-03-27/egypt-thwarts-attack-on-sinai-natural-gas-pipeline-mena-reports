Egypt  thwarted an attack on a
natural-gas pipeline in the northern Sinai city of El Arish, the
  Middle East News Agency  reported today, citing Magdi Tawfik,
head of Egyptian Natural Gas Company,  The North African nation’s gas exports to Arab countries
and Israel haven’t been affected, the state-run agency, also
known as Mena, reported. Additional security staff has been
deployed around the control station in El Arish and the
pipeline, Mena said.  Egyptian natural-gas flows to Israel and Jordan resumed
March 16 after an almost six-week break following an explosion
at the facility in the Sinai.  Egypt has 77 trillion cubic feet (2.18 trillion cubic
meters) in gas reserves and is the main producer of the fuel in
the eastern Mediterranean, according to the U.S. Energy
Department. The country exported 650 billion cubic feet in 2009,
of which 30 percent by the Arab gas pipeline to Jordan, Syria
and Lebanon, or the El Arish-Ashkelon line to  Israel , according
to the department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
