Zimbabwean police may arrest
Lovemore Moyo, a former parliamentary speaker, for “contempt of
court,” the  Sunday Mail  said, citing unidentified officials in
the attorney general’s office.  The attorney general has drawn up a docket charging Moyo
with contempt, the Harare-based Sunday Mail said. The charge
follows the nullification of Moyo’s election as speaker after
President Robert Mugabe’s  Zimbabwe  African National Union-
Patriotic Front party challenged his appointment.  Zimbabwe’s Sunday Mail newspaper is controlled by Mugabe’s
 Zanu-PF  party. Moyo is national chairman of the  Movement for
Democratic Change , led by Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai .  To contact the reporter on this story:
