Alassane Ouattara, internationally
recognized as president of  Ivory Coast , rejected an African
Union envoy chosen to mediate in the country’s four-month-old
political crisis that has led to hundreds of deaths.  The AU yesterday appointed Jose Brito, a former foreign
minister of  Cape Verde , to negotiate a settlement establishing a
government. At least 462 people have been killed and up to 1
million people have fled the world’s biggest cocoa producer in
violence after incumbent Laurent Gbagbo disputed results of the
Nov. 28 general elections and refused to step down as president
of the country, according to United Nations figures.  “Ouattara’s office wishes to express its surprise at the
nomination of Mr. Jose Brito in this post, considering his
personal and political relations with outgoing president  Laurent
Gbagbo ,” according to an e-mailed statement today. “As a
result, the President of the Republic of Ivory Coast rejects Mr.
Jose Brito as the African Union’s High Representative.”  The AU has formally recognized Ouattara as president.  To contact the reporters on this story:
