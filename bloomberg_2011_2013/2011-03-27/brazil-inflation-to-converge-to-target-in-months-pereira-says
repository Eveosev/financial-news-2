Brazil ’s inflation should converge
to target within the next few months as rising agriculture and
food prices slow and policy measures reduce credit growth, said
Luiz Pereira da Silva, deputy governor of Brazil’s central bank.  “We have excessive capital flows contributing to a rapid
pace of domestic credit growth that creates inflationary
pressures,” he said in a speech today in Calgary. “We identified
the need to mitigate risk in some parts of the domestic
credit markets.”  Analysts covering the Brazilian economy raised their 2011
inflation outlook to a high of 5.88 percent, according to the
median estimate in a central bank survey published March 21.
Consumer prices in the 12 months through mid-March rose 6.13
percent, the biggest jump in more than two years.  The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or
minus two percentage points. Policy makers have raised  interest
rates  and tightened capital and reserve requirements for banks
to slow domestic credit growth.  Pereira spoke at a conference of the Institute of
International Finance, as part of the annual meeting of the
 Inter-American Development Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
