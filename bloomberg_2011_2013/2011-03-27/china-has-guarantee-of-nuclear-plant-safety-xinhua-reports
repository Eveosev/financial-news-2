China  guarantees the safety of its
nuclear power facilities and will continue to expand use of the
energy source, the official Xinhua News agency reported today,
citing a government nuclear-safety official.  “There is a guarantee for the safety of China’s nuclear
power facilities and China will not abandon its nuclear power
plan for fear of slight risks,” Tian Shujia, the director of
two safety centers under the Ministry of Environmental
Protection, was quoted as saying.  China’s seven operational nuclear plants have no notable
defects, the report cited Tian as saying. The country plans to
operate 66 plants by 2020 with a total generating capacity of 66
million kilowatts, accounting for 6 percent of China’s total
power capacity, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
