Libyan rebels moved into the
central city of Ajdabiya, recaptured Brega in the east and
advanced toward the strategic oil port of Ras Lanuf, after U.S.
and allied warplanes bombarded Muammar Qaddafi’s tanks,
artillery and soldiers along the coastline and near Tripoli.  Saudi  stocks  rose to the highest level in five weeks as
investors restore confidence in the Arab world’s largest economy
after King Abdullah ordered the creation of a housing ministry.  Egypt ’s Finance Minister Samir Radwan said the stock market
will stabilize this week as the government makes $250 million
available to buy shares, after the index dropped to the lowest
level in almost two years following a seven-week halt.  Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad’s security forces clashed
with protesters in several cities after his promises of freedoms
and pay increases failed to prevent dissent from spreading
across the country.  WHAT TO WATCH:
