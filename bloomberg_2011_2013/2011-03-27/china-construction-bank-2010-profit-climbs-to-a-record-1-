China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the
world’s second-largest lender by market value, said profit rose
26.3 percent to a record last year.  Net income climbed to 134.8 billion yuan ($20.6 billion),
or 0.56 yuan a share, from 106.76 billion yuan, or 0.45 yuan a
share a year earlier, the Beijing-based bank said in a statement
to the Hong Kong stock exchange. That was less than the 139
billion yuan average of 17 estimates compiled by Bloomberg News.  Construction Bank joined  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  in reporting
record annual earnings for a fourth year as demand for consumer
and corporate loans climbed in an economy that overtook  Japan  to
become the world’s second-largest. The earnings increase may
ease investors’ concerns about asset quality deteriorating as
policy makers tighten rules.  “Strong demand for loans and rising pricing power are
still the dominant factors driving banks’ profit growth,”  Wu Xiaoling , a Shenzhen-based analyst at Great Wall Securities Co.,
said. “A rebound in bad loans is a valid and long-term concern,
but that’s not likely to depress earnings anytime soon.”  Construction Bank’s Hong Kong-listed shares gained 1.95
percent to HK$7.32 on March 25, and have risen 5 percent this
year, compared with a 0.5 percent increase in the local
benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   The value of loans outstanding at the state-controlled
lender stood at 5.53 trillion yuan at the end of December, an
increase of 17.8 percent from the beginning of the year. That’s
slower than 2009’s expansion of 27 percent. Chairman Guo Shuqing
on March 11 forecast loan growth will drop below 15 percent this
year.  Interest Margins  Net interest income, or revenue from borrowers minus
interest paid to depositors, gained 18.7 percent to 251.5
billion yuan last year as net interest margin widened to 2.49
percent. Income from fee-based services gained 37.6 percent to
66.1 billion yuan.  Construction Bank, part-owned by  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , set
aside 29.3 billion yuan in provisions against bad debts in 2010,
compared with 25.5 billion yuan a year earlier.  --Luo Jun. Editors: James Gunsalus, Nerys Avery  To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
