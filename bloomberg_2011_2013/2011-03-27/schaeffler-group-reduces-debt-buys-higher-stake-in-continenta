Schaeffler Group, the world’s
second-biggest maker of roller bearings, has agreed with banks
on refinancing for its debt and will increase its stake in
 Continental AG (CON) , Europe’s second-largest tiremaker,  German lenders M.M. Warburg and Bankhaus Metzler will each
sell as many as 15 million shares in Continental through an
accelerated bookbuilt offering and use the proceeds to reduce
Schaeffler’s debt, Herzogenaurach, Bavaria-based Schaeffler said
in an e-mailed statement today.  The rebound in the  auto industry  last year has boosted
Continental’s sales and earnings. The company reported revenue
and profit that beat analyst estimates for the fourth quarter
and predicted rising sales from  Asia  this year will compensate
for additional costs from surging rubber prices.  M.M. Warburg and Bankhaus Metzler will also each sell 7.7
million Continental shares to Schaeffler, which will increase
its stake in the Hanover, Germany-based tiremaker to 49.9
percent from 42.2 percent, according to the statement.  The two banks won’t sell additional shares in the next 12
months, according to the company. The banks confirmed
Schaeffler’s announcement in e-mailed statements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
