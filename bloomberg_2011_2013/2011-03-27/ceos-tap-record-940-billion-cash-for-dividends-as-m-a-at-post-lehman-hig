U.S. executives are starting to
spend the record $940 billion in cash they built up after the
credit crisis, just in time for annual shareholder meetings.  Takeovers topped $260 billion this quarter, the most since
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Standard & Poor’s 500
Index companies authorized 38 percent more buybacks in 2011 than
a year earlier and dividends may increase to a record $31.07 a
share in 2013, data compiled by Birinyi Associates Inc. and
Bloomberg show.  Chief executive officers are looking for ways to increase
investor returns after posting the biggest gain in profits since
1988 by relying on near-zero Federal Reserve interest rates and
cost cuts that have kept the  unemployment rate  near a 26-year
high. More than 139 companies in the U.S. equity benchmark index
are preparing for shareholder meetings in the next two months
after the S&P 500 almost doubled in the past two years and as
profits approach a record.  “Shareholders have raised the bar,” said  Alan Gayle ,
senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in
Richmond, Virginia, which oversees $45 billion. “Companies are
going to have to find ways to generate more return,” he said.
“The idea of sitting on idle cash in a zero interest rate
environment is increasingly viewed as a nonviable option.”  AT&T, Schwab  More takeovers were announced last week than any time since
March 2010 after  AT&T Inc. (T)  in Dallas offered $39 billion for
Bonn-based  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s U.S. wireless unit and San
Francisco-based  Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW)  agreed to buy  OptionsXpress
Holdings Inc. (OXPS)  of  Chicago  for $1.11 billion in stock.  Cisco
Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the world’s largest maker of networking equipment,
said on March 18 that it will pay a quarterly dividend for the
first time of 6 cents.  Companies in the S&P 500 have been piling up money for two
years as per-share profit jumped 36 percent in 2010, the most in
more than two decades, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
world’s largest economy is forecast to expand 3.1 percent this
year, the fastest annual pace since 2005, based on the median
estimate from 68 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The rate of U.S. growth in the fourth quarter was revised
to 3.1 percent from 2.8 percent and consumer sentiment dropped
more than forecast in March, according to reports on March 25.
The Labor Department may say this week that U.S. unemployment
remained at 8.9 percent in March, according to the median
economist estimate tracked by Bloomberg.  Weekly Gain  The  S&P 500  gained 2.7 percent to 1,313.80 last week,
reducing its decline from a 32-month high of 1,343.01 on Feb. 18
to 2.2 percent. The benchmark gauge for American equities had
fallen 6.4 percent through March 16 as investors speculated
 Japan ’s earthquake would cripple its economy and uprisings in
Libya and Egypt spurred concern fuel costs will stoke inflation.
The  stock index  slipped 0.3 percent to 1,310.19 today.  Oil climbed above $106 a barrel in New York on March 24 as
allied warplanes continued strikes against Muammar Qaddafi’s
ground forces in Libya. In Japan, manufacturers started
production at idled plants even as authorities struggled to seal
radiation leaks caused by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.
European leaders met in Brussels after Portugal’s parliament
rejected budget cuts and two officials with direct knowledge of
the matter said the country may require a 70 billion euro ($98
billion) bailout.  Rewarding Shareholders  Companies including Limited Brands Inc., owner of the
Victoria’s Secret chain, are relying on debt to reward
shareholders. The drop in borrowing costs to a three-year low
has given executives the incentive to sell bonds and use the
proceeds to repurchase stock and pay dividends.  The extra yield investors demand to own investment-grade
corporate debt instead of Treasuries reached 148 basis points on
Feb. 17, the lowest since October 2007, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data.  At least nine borrowers had their credit ratings cut this
quarter because they favored shareholders over bondholders, the
most since the fourth quarter of 2007, according to Moody’s
Corp. S&P reduced its outlook for Limited Brands to “negative”
after the Columbus, Ohio-based company sold $1 billion of bonds
last week to help fund its stock buyback.  ‘Be Careful’  “You’ve got to be careful going down that road,” said
Brian Barish, president of Cambiar Investors LLC, which manages
about $5.6 billion in Denver. “Companies can do some long-term
damage to themselves by levering up to buy back stock just
because they’re bullish on their stock when the market isn’t.
Sometimes the market has it right and companies have it wrong.”  Companies increased cash balances in part by cutting
capital expenditures 26 percent in 2009, the biggest drop since
records began in 1998, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Cash levels may start falling as analysts’ estimates show S&P
500 companies will boost spending on plants, property and
equipment about 22 percent this year, the most ever.  “As the markets have recovered and access to credit has
become readily available, issuers are increasingly looking to
return capital to shareholders,” Greg Hall, a managing director
in debt capital markets at Barclays Plc in  New York , said in an
e-mail. “As the economy continues to improve and corporations
feel more confident in the future, we expect to see even more
activity.”  S&P 500 Valuation  Equity priced below historical valuations is helping fuel
mergers and repurchases. The S&P 500 trades at 15.4 times
reported earnings, compared with an average of 16.4 since 1954,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Based on analysts’ forecast for
2011 profits, the index’s price-earnings ratio is 13.6,
according to the data.  The value of takeovers increased 35 percent in the first
quarter from the same period in 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Acquisition prices exceeded market value by 23 percent on
average, the smallest premium since the third quarter of 2007.
That’s a sign to MFS Investment Management’s James Swanson that
deals haven’t reached speculative levels.  “There’s a lot more vigilance on the part of shareholders,
institutions and  hedge funds  about companies paying too much for
acquisitions,” said Swanson, chief investment strategist at
Boston-based MFS, which oversees about $230 billion. “Companies
don’t want to overpay.”  Trailing Peers  While the stock market return for buyers in about half of
the 100 biggest takeovers made between 2005 to 2008 trailed
industry peers two years later, acquirers are seeing gains this
year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  DuPont Co. has advanced 8.7 percent since Jan. 9, after it
offered 39.3 billion kroner ($7.41 billion) in cash for Danisco
A/S, a maker of enzymes used in biofuels. The deal would be the
biggest since 1999 for the third-largest U.S. chemical maker,
which had $6.8 billion in cash and short-term investments as of
Dec. 31, the largest end-of-year figure since at least 1991.  S&P 500 companies have approved $149.8 billion in share
repurchases in the past three months, exceeding the $125 billion
for all of 2009 and the $108.3 billion announced during the
first three months of 2010, data from Westport, Connecticut-
based Birinyi Associates show.  Companies reducing their shares outstanding are beating the
market. The Share BuyBack Achievers Index, which tracks U.S.
companies that have repurchased at least 5 percent of their
stock in the past 12 months, has climbed 6.3 percent this year,
exceeding the S&P 500’s 4.5 percent gain.  Dividend Increases  ConocoPhillips (COP)  has jumped 12 percent since Feb. 11, when
the third-largest U.S. oil company boosted its dividend and
added $10 billion to its stock buyback plan. The S&P 500 has
lost 1.2 percent. Chief Executive Officer  Jim Mulva  said last
week in a meeting with analysts that he plans to increase the
Houston-based company’s dividend at least 10 percent each year.  “P/Es are not very high right now, so it’s accretive to
earnings per share to buy back shares, and payout ratios are
very low by historic standards, so they’re probably going to get
those up higher,” Swanson said. “The level of cash coming back
to the shareholders is on its way up.”  S&P 500 companies offer a dividend yield, or stock price
divided by the annual payment, of 1.84 percent, data tracked by
Bloomberg show. That’s below the average of 2.30 percent since
1971. Cisco and  WellPoint Inc. (WLP) , an Indianapolis-based health
insurer, are among the 10 companies in the S&P 500 that said
they will start paying dividends this year, according to a March
22 report by S&P. That’s the most for the first quarter since at
least 2004.  Cisco, WellPoint  Cisco of  San Jose ,  California , posted the first weekly gain
in more than a month after announcing the payout, which equates
to a 1.39 percent yield. WellPoint has jumped 6.2 percent since
Feb. 23, when the company said it would begin a 25-cent
dividend, compared with the S&P 500’s 0.1 percent drop.  “Having this much cash on the balance sheet earning
essentially nothing is hurting companies’ numbers, it’s hurting
their return on equity, it’s hurting their ability to provide
income in the long run for investors,” said  David Kelly , who
helps oversee about $445 billion as chief market strategist for
JPMorgan Funds in New York. “If they can’t find something
better to do with it than leave it as cash, the best thing is to
return it to shareholders.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
