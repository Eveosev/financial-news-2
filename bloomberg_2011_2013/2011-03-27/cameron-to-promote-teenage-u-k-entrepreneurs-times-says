U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
will give his support to  “Tenner Tycoon,”  a program that gives
schoolchildren 10 pounds ($16) to start micro-enterprises, The
 Sunday Times said .  About 250,000 children will be involved in the project, the
newspaper said. It is part of an effort to promote private
sector growth in the U.K. through the government’s “Start Up
Britain” program,  which encourages people to start their own
businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
