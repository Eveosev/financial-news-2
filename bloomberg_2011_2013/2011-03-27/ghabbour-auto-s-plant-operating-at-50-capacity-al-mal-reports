Ghabbour Auto’s main plant is
working at 50 percent of capacity because of recent political
unrest in  Egypt ,  Al Mal  reported, citing a company official it
didn’t identify.  Output at the factory, which assembles about 30,000 Hyundai
Verna cars a year, has dropped to 50 cars daily from 100 cars,
the Cairo-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
