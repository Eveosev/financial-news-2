Virginia Commonwealth University
ousted the University of  Kansas , the last remaining No. 1 seed,
to advance to the national semifinals at college basketball’s
men’s championship.  The 11th-ranked Rams beat the Jayhawks 71-61 at the
Alamodome in  San Antonio  to win the Southwest Regional and set
up a Final Four meeting with Butler on April 2.   VCU is the third No. 11 seed to reach the Final Four in the
National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament
and the first since George Mason in 2006. Louisiana State in
1986 also reached the national semifinals as an 11th-ranked
team.   In nine prior visits to the tournament, VCU had never made
it past the second round. Kansas was seeking a fourth NCAA title
in its 40th trip to the tournament. The Jayhawks haven’t reached
the Final Four since they won the last of their titles in 2008.  Also today, No. 4  Kentucky  will vie with No. 2  North
Carolina  in the East Regional final for the right to play
Connecticut in the national semifinals on April 2.  The championship game is scheduled for April 4 in Houston.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
