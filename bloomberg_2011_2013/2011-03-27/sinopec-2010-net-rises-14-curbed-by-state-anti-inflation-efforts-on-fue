China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) ,
 Asia ’s biggest refiner, posted a 14 percent gain in annual
profit, missing estimates, after increases in government-
controlled fuel prices lagged behind gains in crude oil costs.  Net income rose to 71.8 billion yuan ($11 billion), or
0.820 yuan a share, from a restated 63.1 billion yuan, or 0.724
yuan, a year earlier, the company known as Sinopec said in a
 statement  to the Hong Kong stock exchange today. That compares
with a 72.5 billion-yuan mean profit forecast of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  China , Asia’s biggest oil consumer, controls fuel prices to
curb inflation. The government raised tariffs three times last
year, by less than 5 percent each time, and cut once, while
average crude prices increased 28 percent compared with 2009.  “The Chinese central government has made it clear that
keeping prices under control is their top priority for 2011,
posing a threat to Sinopec’s earnings as international  crude oil 
continues to rise,” Yin Xiaodong, an oil analyst at Citic
Securities Co., said by phone.  Consumer prices rose 4.9 percent in February from a year
earlier, exceeding China’s 2011 target for a fifth month. The
state last increased fuel prices on Feb. 21, by as much as 4.6
percent, after crude surged above $100 a barrel on concerns that
anti-government protests in the Middle East and North Africa
would disrupt supplies.  Sinopec advanced 24 percent in Hong Kong trading in the
past year, compared with the 9.1 percent gain in the benchmark
 Hang Seng Index . The stock rose 1.3 percent to close at HK$7.85
on March 25.  Fuel-Pricing System  Based on a mechanism introduced in December 2008, the
National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic
planner, can revise fuel prices when oil costs change by more
than 4 percent over 22 working days. Crude fell 0.2 percent in
 New York  on March 25 to settle at $105.40 a barrel.  China needs to improve its fuel-pricing system, which has
to be “consistent with international practice,” Premier  Wen Jiabao  said on March 21, adding that he was “shocked” the
price of crude had exceeded $100 a barrel.  The government may raise gasoline and diesel prices by 20
percent this year to help curb energy consumption, Mirae Asset
Securities Co. said in January. Rival PetroChina Co. said on
March 17 its refining operations are profitable with crude at
$90 a barrel.  Rising Fuel Demand  Refineries run by PetroChina and Sinopec increased oil
processing volume to a record last month to meet rising
consumption in the world’s fastest-growing major economy,
government data showed. Manufacturing gained 14.9 percent in
February, beating economists’ estimates.  The NDRC told state refiners to maximize production of
gasoline to meet demand from airlines and farms, the country’s
top economic planner said in a statement on March 11.  China’s economy  grew 10.3 percent in 2010, spurring energy
consumption. Vehicle sales jumped 32 percent, keeping the nation
the world’s biggest auto market, while industrial output climbed
15.7 percent.  In October, parent China Petrochemical Corp. agreed to pay
$7.1 billion for a 40 percent stake in Repsol YPF SA’s Brazilian
unit to help meet Chinese demand. China Petrochemical and
 Spain ’s largest oil company are in talks on joint ventures
around the world after the investment, Repsol said on Jan. 4.  Sinopec’s parent said in December it would buy Occidental
Petroleum Corp.’S Argentine oil and gas unit for $2.45 billion,
marking the company’s first investment in the Latin American
country. The acquisition took Chinese bids for overseas energy
assets to a record $38.8 billion last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  -- Wang Ying  and John Duce in  Hong Kong . Editors: Ryan Woo,  Paul Gordon .  To contact the reporters on this story:
