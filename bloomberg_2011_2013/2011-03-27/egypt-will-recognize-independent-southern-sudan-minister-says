Egypt  will recognize  Southern Sudan 
as a separate country when it is declared independent in July,
Foreign Minister Nabil El-Arabi said today in  Sudan .  “Egypt intends to be the second to recognize the south”
after the Sudanese government, El-Arabi told reporters in
Khartoum, the Sudanese capital. He was in Sudan with an Egyptian
delegation that included Prime Minister Essam Sharaf, who was
sworn in March 7. They will travel to Southern Sudan tomorrow.  Almost 99 percent of Southern Sudanese voters chose to
secede from Sudan and form an independent country in a January
referendum.  The independence referendum was the centerpiece of a 2005
peace agreement ending a civil war that raged for all but 11
years since Sudan’s independence from the U.K. in 1956. The
conflict pitted Sudan’s mostly Muslim north against the south,
where Christianity and traditional religions dominate.  Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir’s  National Congress Party 
said this month that it will recognize the new nation in
Southern Sudan, despite rising tensions as the Southern Sudanese
ruling party suspended talks temporarily, accusing the north of
arming militias in the south to destabilize the region and
topple its government before July. The Sudanese government
denies the accusations.  Trade between Sudan and Egypt in 2010 was worth $628
million, up from about $600 million 2009, Sharaf said at a
meeting with Sudanese officials today.  Egyptians are currently investing over $5 billion in Sudan,
Sudanese Vice President Ali Osman Taha said at the meeting
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
