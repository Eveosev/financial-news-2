Italy will seek to present a plan
for  Libya  together with Germany at a March 29 meeting in London,
daily la Repubblica reported, citing an interview with Foreign
Minister Franco Frattini.  Italy’s plan would include a ceasefire monitored by the
United Nations and a permanent “humanitarian corridor” that it
is working on with Turkey’s government, Frattini was cited as
saying. The plan would back the African Union to convince leader
 Muammar Qaddafi  to leave Libya, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
