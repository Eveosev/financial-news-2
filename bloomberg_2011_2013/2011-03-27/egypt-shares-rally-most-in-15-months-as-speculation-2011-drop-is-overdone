(Corrects to show shares rally most in 15 months in
headline.)  Egyptian shares advanced, sending
the benchmark index up the most in more than 15 months and
forcing a 30-minute trading suspension, on speculation the 12
percent decline last week was overdone.  The  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  climbed 4.9 percent, the most since
December 2009, to 5,195.47 as of 12:05 p.m. in Cairo.  Orascom
Construction Industries (OCIC) ,  Egypt ’s biggest publicly traded
builder, rose for the second day.  Commercial International Bank
Egypt SAE (COMI) , the nation’s largest lender, surged 7.1 percent, the
most since July 2010, to 31.89 pounds. The EGX 100 Index rose 7
percent.  “The whole market is cheap,” Ashraf Akhnoukh, senior
equity sales trader at Cairo-based Commercial International
Brokerage, said before the market opened. “Investors are
looking for cheap and safe stocks.” Orascom Construction is a
top stock pick because of its “international and regional”
operations, he said.  The EGX 30’s 27 percent plunge this year, sparked by the
unrest that led to the ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak  last
month, left it valued at about 1.4 times net assets, or book
value, compared with nearly 2 times net assets at the end of
2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Trading was suspended for
30 minutes after the broader  EGX 100 Index (EGX100)  rose 5.1 percent
today, exceeding a 5 percent daily limit, bourse spokesman
Hisham Turk said.  Orascom Construction has business spanning the Middle East,
North Africa and  Europe , according to its  website . The shares
were trading at a 9.9 percent discount to its London-listed
stocks, or global depository receipts, based on closing prices
March 25.  Orascom Construction rose 7.4 percent to 219.91 pounds.
 Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) , the biggest mobile-phone operator
in North Africa, surged 8.5 percent to 4.2 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
