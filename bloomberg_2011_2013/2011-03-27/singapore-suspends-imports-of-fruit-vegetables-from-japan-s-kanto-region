Singapore suspended fruit and
vegetable imports from  Japan â€™s Kanto region after more
radioactive contaminants were detected in two samples of
vegetables.  The city-state halted imports from four prefectures in
Kanto and will now extend the suspension to  Tokyo  and two other
prefectures, the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore
said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday. The island also
earlier stopped imports of milk, seafood and meat from four
other affected areas in Japan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
