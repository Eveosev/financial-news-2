Pressure within a container at the
crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant shows that the vessel
may be undamaged, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano
said on an NHK television program today.  “The pressure within the containment vessel is higher
than the atmospheric pressure, so there’s probably no damage to
the unit,” Edano said in  Tokyo .  Editor: Nate Hosoda  To contact the reporter on this story:
