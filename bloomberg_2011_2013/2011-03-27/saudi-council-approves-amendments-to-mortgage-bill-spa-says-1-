Saudi Arabia ’s consultative Shoura
Council approved amendments to a mortgage draft law, the
official  Saudi Press Agency  reported, citing the council’s
secretary general.  The law will help meet Saudi citizens’ needs in houses and
will ease the problem of high rents, the news service cited
Abdullah Bin Mohammed Al al-Shaikh as saying. It will also boost
the government’s $67 billion spending plan to build 500,000
houses for Saudi nationals, SPA said.  The law allows banks to offer real estate financing through
owning houses for the sake of financing their sale, the news
service added. The law may also award licences to one or more
joint stock companies in order to refinance mortgages in line
with the market needs, it added.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, needs 900
new houses a day completed over the next five years, according
to a Jones Lang LaSalle report released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
