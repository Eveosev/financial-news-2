Adam Posen , a member of the Bank of
Englandâ€™s Monetary Policy Committee, said the U.K. inflation
rate will fall to 1.5 percent by the middle of 2012 as consumer
spending declines amid government austerity and a weak economy,
the Guardian reported, citing an interview. Posen said he would
not seek re-election to the MPC if his view that more money
should be injected into the economy turns out to be wrong.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
