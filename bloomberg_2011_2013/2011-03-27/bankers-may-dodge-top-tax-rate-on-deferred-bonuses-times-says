Offshore trusts set up to hold
deferred bonus payments as required by regulations on bankers’
pay may be a loophole that allows recipients to avoid the U.K.’s
top 50 percent  tax rate , the  Sunday Times  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Under a secret compromise that’s been agreed on, the best-
paid bankers will dodge tax on part of their bonus payments for
three to five years, by which time the 50 percent rate probably
will have been scrapped, the newspaper said.  Click here for web link   To contact the reporter on this story:
