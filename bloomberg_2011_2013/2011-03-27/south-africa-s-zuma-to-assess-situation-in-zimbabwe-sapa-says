President  Jacob Zuma  told
Zimbabwe’s Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai  that he would assess
the political situation in Zimbabwe and communicate his
findings, the South African Press Agency reported today, citing
Zuma’s spokesman Zizi Kodwa.  Zuma met with Tsvangirai at the president’s home in Nkandla
village in Kwazulu-Natal province yesterday to discuss
developments in Zimbabwe, Sapa said. Violence and intimidation
in the neighboring country are increasing following calls by its
president, Robert Mugabe, to hold elections to end its coalition
government, Sapa said, citing  Human Rights Watch .  To contact the reporter on this story:
