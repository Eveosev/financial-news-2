New Zealand  beat England today to
win Hong Kong’s  rugby sevens tournament , the world’s premier
event in the shortened version of the game.  New Zealand triumphed in the final of the three-day
tournament, with a 29-17 victory over England.  Twenty-four teams took part in this year’s tournament,
sponsored by Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and Credit Suisse Group
AG. The Hong Kong competition offers a prize of $100,000 to the
winning team, $25,000 to the runners-up and $12,500 to the semi-
finalists, and offers the most points out of the tournaments on
the world circuit.  Kenya won the shield, Canada took the bowl and  South Africa 
was awarded the plate after they were eliminated from the cup
contest. Hosts  Hong Kong  were beaten by  China  in the quarter
finals.  Before the Hong Kong event, England and New Zealand jointly
led the IRB World Sevens Series with 80 points, followed by Fiji
and Samoa with 64 points and South Africa on 56. The next
tournament is in Adelaide, Australia, on April 2 and 3.  The IOC has included the rugby sevens in its program and
the sport will debut in the Rio de Janeiro games in 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
