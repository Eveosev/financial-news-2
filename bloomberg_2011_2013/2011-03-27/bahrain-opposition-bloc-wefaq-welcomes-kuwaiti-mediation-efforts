Bahrain’s largest Shiite opposition
bloc,  al-Wefaq , said it welcomed a Kuwaiti initiative to mediate
between the Bahraini government and its opponents.  “For the most part, the initiative is welcomed,” Jasim
Husain Ali, a member of the group, said in a telephone interview
from Manama today. “The details still have to be worked out. It
is very hard to see how things will go.”  The government of the Persian Gulf country quelled more
than a month of protests and declared a three-month state of
emergency on March 15 after troops from  Saudi Arabia  and other
Arab Gulf states arrived to support the kingdom’s Sunni monarch.
Protesters, most of them from the island nation’s Shiite
majority community, have held mass rallies starting Feb. 14 to
demand democracy and more civil rights.  Officials from al-Wefaq arrived in  Kuwait  to discuss the
initiative, Kuwait-based  al-Seyassah  reported today, without
saying where it got the information. Kuwait mediation efforts
will be headed by Kuwait’s Speaker of the Parliament Jassim al-
Kharafi, the newspaper said.  Bahrain’s Shiite-led opposition has accepted Kharafi’s
terms that it not insist on the resignation of the Bahraini
prime minister or make any demands on the nation’s Sunni ruler
King Hamad Bin Isa or his family, according to the Kuwait-based
newspaper.  Shiites make up about 70 percent of the population and many
retain cultural and family ties with  Iran  as well as with
Shiites in Saudi Arabia, who are a minority of about 10 to 15
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
