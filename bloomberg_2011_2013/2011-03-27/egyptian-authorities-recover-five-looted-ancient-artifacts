Egypt â€™s army and police forces
recovered five ancient artifacts stolen from the Egyptian Museum
during the uprising that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak , the
state-run Middle East News Agency said today.  The pieces recovered are all made of bronze and include
statues of different gods, MENA said on its website. Thirty
seven artifacts looted from the museum in central Cairo are
still missing, the Cairo-based news agency said.  The museum on March 15 issued a list of ancient artifacts,
including three gilded wooden statues of King Tutankhamun, that
went missing after looters broke into the building during the
protests in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
