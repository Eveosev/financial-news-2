Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  is seeking
a 20 billion-pound ($32 billion) loan to start selling 600
branches as a condition of its U.K. government bailout, the
Sunday Times said, without saying where it got the information.  Loans made by these branches exceed the deposits they hold
by 30 billion pounds and Lloyds needs to fill the gap, according
to thee newspaper. The additional funding would widen the group
of potential bidders, it reported.  Lloyds spokeswoman Risha Parmar declined to comment when
contacted by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
