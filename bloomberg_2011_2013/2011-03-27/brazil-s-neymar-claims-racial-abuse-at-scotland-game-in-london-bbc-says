Brazil striker Neymar said he was
racially abused at today’s soccer game against  Scotland  in
 London , where he scored both goals in a 2-0 victory, the  British
Broadcasting Corp.  reported.  Santos player Neymar said a banana was thrown at him during
the exhibition match at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium, the  BBC 
added.  “This atmosphere of racism is totally sad,” Neymar was
cited as telling a Brazilian TV station. “We leave our country
to play here and something like this happens.”  It’s not clear who threw the banana as it seemed to come
from a section of the ground that contained mainly Brazilian
fans, the BBC said. Brazil coach Mano Menezes said he hadn’t
seen the incident.  Neymar opened the scoring in the 42nd minute and got the
second goal with a penalty kick in the 77th.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
