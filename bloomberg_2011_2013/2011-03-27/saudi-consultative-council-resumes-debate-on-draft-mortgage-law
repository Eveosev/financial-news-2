Saudi Arabia ’s Shoura Council
started a fresh debate on a draft mortgage law today, according
to a member of the consultative body.  Saad Mariq, deputy chairman of the council’s financial
committee, said in a phone interview he didn’t know how long it
might take for the council to approve the law.  The law, originally submitted about two years ago, aims to
bring private lenders into the market by adopting a clearer set
of rules. Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, needs
900 new houses a day completed over the next five years,
according to a Jones Lang LaSalle report released today.  Saudi  King Abdullah  must approve the mortgage law if it’s
passed by the council. The king on March 18 ordered the
construction of 500,000 houses for Saudis at a cost of 250
billion riyals ($67 billion).  The Saudi monarch also raised the value of mortgages
provided to nationals by the country’s Real Estate Development
Fund to 500,000 riyals from 300,000 riyals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
