European Central Bank council
member Ewald Nowotny said he expects a “normalization” in the
bank’s monetary policy regarding  interest rates  and liquidity
measures,  ORF  Austrian Television said today.  “Nothing will change in terms of our original outlook that
we want to go in the direction of normalization,” Nowotny,
who’s also the head of the Austrian National Bank, told ORF in
an interview today.  Inflation is driven by rising oil prices, partly caused by
political unrest in the Middle East, Nowotny said. It is
important to avoid “second round effects” in which higher
energy costs boost prices for other goods, he added in the ORF
interview.  Estimates that  Portugal  may need about 75 billion euros
($106 billion) of financial aid “are not completely
unrealistic,” Nowotny also said. Portugal should ask for help
from the European rescue fund, he added.  This year’s inflation rate in  Austria  is expected to range
between 2.5 percent and 2.7 percent which is “clearly too
high,’” Nowotny told ORF. The country’s budget deficit will be
above 3 percent this year and possibly in 2012, meaning there’s
no room for cutting taxes, he said. Austria’s debt as a
percentage of gross domestic product stands at about 80 percent
following most recent calculations, Nowotny said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
