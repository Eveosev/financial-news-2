Corn may rise on speculation that
the U.S. government this week will report smaller inventories
left from last year’s crop than a year earlier. Soybeans may
rise on expectations that higher returns for other crops will
cut the area sown with the oilseed in the U.S.  Twenty-two of 27 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo 
to Chicago on March 24 said corn will advance this week, and 20
of 28 respondents said soybeans will gain. Last week on the
Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for May delivery rose 0.9
percent to $6.895 a bushel, and soybeans futures for May
delivery declined 0.3 percent to $13.5825 a bushel.  Last week’s advance in corn was expected by the majority of
respondents surveyed on March 18, while the drop in soybeans was
a surprise. Since 2004, the surveys have been correct 56 percent
of the time for corn, and 53 percent for soybeans.  Bullish on corn: 22    Bullish on soybeans: 20
Bearish on corn:  5    Bearish on soybeans:  8  To contact the reporter on this story:
