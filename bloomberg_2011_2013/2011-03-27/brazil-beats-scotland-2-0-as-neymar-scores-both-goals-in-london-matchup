Neymar scored both goals as  Brazil 
beat Scotland 2-0 in an exhibition soccer match in London today.  The Santos striker gave five-time World Cup winner Brazil
the lead in the 42nd minute, rifling a right-foot shot past
goalkeeper Allan McGregor at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium. The
second goal came from a penalty kick in the 77th minute after
Neymar was fouled by  Charlie Adam .          Scotland, aiming to beat Brazil for the first time after
nine failed attempts, never looked like doing so as the South
Americans dominated.   Brazil is rated fifth in world governing body FIFA’s
rankings, while Scotland is 50th.   More than 53,000 people attended the game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
