Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development Chief Economist Pier Carlo Padoan
said the economic crisis will last longer and  Europe  has shown
that it can react well, La Stampa reported.  Padoan added in an interview that no one still knows if
 Portugal  or other countries will need to restructure their debt,
the newspaper said.  He added that he didn’t expect a rise in interest rates
would have an impact on a recovery, La Stampa reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
