The U.K Treasury will receive less
tax than previously expected during the next five years after
bankers’ bonuses were reduced, the  Sunday Telegraph  said, citing
figures from the government’s fiscal watchdog.  The reduction amounts to as much as 5 billion pounds ($8
billion) for the period, the newspaper reported, citing
forecasts by the  Office for Budget Responsibility . Bankers will
receive about 10 billion pounds less in bonuses in the next six
years, the office said, according to the Sunday Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
