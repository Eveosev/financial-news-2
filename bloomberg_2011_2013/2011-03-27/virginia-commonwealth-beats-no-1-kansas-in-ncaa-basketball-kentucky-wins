The Final Four is set -- with the
 University of Kentucky  moving a step closer to an eighth
championship and Virginia Commonwealth University etching a
place in college basketball history.  Kentucky defeated the University of North Carolina 76-69 in
an East Regional final in  Newark ,  New Jersey , between the teams
with the most all-time wins at the National Collegiate Athletic
Association men’s tournament.  Virginia Commonwealth stunned the University of Kansas 71-
61 in the Southwest Regional final in San Antonio to tie a NCAA
Tournament record as the lowest-seeded team to reach the
national semifinals.  VCU is the third No. 11 regional seed to make the Final
Four, joining Louisiana State in 1986 and George Mason in 2006.
The Rams will play Butler University, which won the Southeast
Regional as a No. 8 seed, on April 2 in Houston. No Final Four
matchup has featured two teams ranked lower since tournament
seeding began in 1979.  Kentucky , the fourth seed from the East, will play West
Regional No. 3 seed University of  Connecticut  in the other
semifinal for a spot in the April 4 championship game.  This is the third time in 33 years the Final Four hasn’t
featured a No. 1 regional seed, following 1980 and 2006.  VCU Stuns Kansas  Kansas was the last No. 1 to fall, becoming the latest
victim in VCU’s postseason run. Jamie Skeen scored 26 points to
lead the Rams, who made 12-of-25 3-point shots and limited
Kansas to 36 percent shooting.  VCU opened a 14-point halftime lead and then held off the
Jayhawks in improving to 28-11.  “We knew  Kansas  was going to make a run in the second
half, but we never gave up that lead, our guys kept fighting,”
VCU coach Shaka Smart told CBS in a televised courtside
interview. “The only people that matter are the 14 guys on our
team and they never stopped believing.”  Richmond, Virginia-based Virginia Commonwealth slipped into
the NCAA tournament field as one of the last at-large
selections, having lost to Old Dominion in the title game of the
Colonial Athletic Association tournament.  Never having won more than one game in nine prior visits to
the NCAA tournament, VCU beat Southern California to start its
run and then followed with victories over Georgetown, Purdue and
Florida State before upsetting top-seeded Kansas (35-3).
Virginia Commonwealth was a 12-point underdog against the
Jayhawks, according to Las Vegas oddsmakers.  3-Point Shooting  Virginia Commonwealth took control against Kansas early,
using a 20-4 scoring run to open a 20-10 advantage.  The Rams built their advantage to 41-27 at halftime,
hitting 9-of-17 3-pointers while holding the nation’s top-
shooting team to 32 percent from the field.  Kansas used a 12-0 second-half scoring run to pull within
46-44 with 13:13 remaining. Jayhawks twin brothers Markieff and
Marcus Morris then both picked up their third fouls six seconds
apart and the Rams followed with an 11-3 spurt to push their
lead back to 10 points with 8:53 left.  The Jayhawks, who won their 2008 national championship in
 San Antonio , couldn’t get closer than five points the rest of
the way. Marcus Morris led Kansas with 20 points and 16
rebounds, while Markieff had 13 points and committed eight
turnovers. The Jayhawks made 2-of-22 3-point shots and hit 54
percent of their free throws.  Kentucky (29-8) is headed back to the Final Four for the
14th time and the first since its 1998 championship season.  Kentucky Wins  Freshman guard Brandon Knight scored 22 points, as five
Wildcats scored 11 or more points. DeAndre Liggins and Josh
Harrellson each added 12 for Kentucky.  The Wildcats built an 11-point second-half lead and then
withstood a rally by the second-seeded Tar Heels, who were
denied a record-extending 19th Final Four appearance.  Kentucky led 38-30 at halftime and was up 47-36 with 16:01
remaining at the Prudential Center in Newark.  When  North Carolina  (29-8) fought back to tie the score 67-
67 with 3:18 remaining, Knight answered with a 3-pointer for the
Wildcats. Liggins hit another 3-pointer for Kentucky with 35
seconds left and Knight sealed the victory with three free
throws in the final 19 seconds.  Kentucky avenged a 75-73 Dec. 4 loss in  Chapel Hill , North
Carolina, and extended its winning streak to 10 games. The
Wildcats have a record 107 all-time NCAA tournament wins, moving
two ahead of second-place North Carolina. Their seven national
titles are four behind UCLA’s record total.  Tyler Zeller had 21 points and nine rebounds to lead the
Tar Heels.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
