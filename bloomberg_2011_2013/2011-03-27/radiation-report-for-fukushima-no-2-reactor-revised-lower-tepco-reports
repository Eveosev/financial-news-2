Tokyo Electric Power Co. corrected
a report on the level of radiation in the water on the floor of
the generator building for reactor No. 2 at its Fukushima
nuclear plant. The level was 100,000 times normal, not 10
million times as earlier reported, company Vice President Sakae
Muto said in a briefing broadcast on the Internet. Iodine 134
was not detected, as was reported from an earlier test, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
