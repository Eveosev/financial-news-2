Middle East stocks rallied, with
 Egypt ’s benchmark index rising the most in more than 15 months
as investors said the shares were cheap after last week’s 12
percent plunge and as political stability was restored.  Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC) , Egypt’s biggest publicly
traded builder, rose for a second day.  Commercial International
Bank Egypt SAE (COMI) , the nation’s biggest lender, surged 7.4 percent.
The  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  climbed 5.3 percent, the most since December
2009, to 5,212.08 at the 1:30 p.m. close in Cairo. The measure
dropped to the lowest level in almost two years last week after
trading resumed following an almost two-month halt. The index,
down 27 percent this year, is the world’s worst performer. The
 EGX 100 Index (EGX100)  increased 7.2 percent today.  Shares were pushed up by “a combination of cheap
valuations and relative political and economic stability,” said
Teymour El-Derini, head of Middle East Sales at Cairo-based
Naeem Brokerage. “Investors may be encouraged to see signs of
the country returning to normalcy.”  The EGX 30’s plunge this year, sparked by the unrest that
led to the ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak  last month, has
left the index valued at 1.4 times net assets, or book value,
compared with 1.9 times at the end of 2010, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Egyptians voted in favor of constitutional changes on March
19, paving the way for parliamentary and presidential elections
by year-end. The country’s Cabinet also proposed a law last week
to criminalize protests that hinder the work of public and
private establishments to curb the almost daily demonstrations
the country has seen following the ouster of Mubarak.  ‘Cheap and Safe’  “Investors are looking for cheap and safe stocks,” said
Ashraf Akhnoukh, senior equity sales trader at Cairo-based
Commercial International Brokerage.  Orascom Construction  is a
top stock pick because of its “international and regional”
operations, he said. The shares were at a 9.9 percent discount
to the London-listed stock, or global depositary shares, based
on closing prices March 25.  Orascom Construction rose 8.2 percent to 221.52 pounds.
Commercial International Bank soared the most since Feb. 2009 to
31.98 pounds.  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) , the biggest mobile-
phone operator in North Africa, surged 9.6 percent to 4.24
pounds.  In the  Persian Gulf , Qatar’s measure rose 1 percent, the
most in a week. Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  gained 0.2 percent to
1,556.31, the highest in a month.  ‘Positive Momentum’  “The positive momentum continues with the solid
performance of Saudi markets,” said Ahmed Talhaoui, the Abu
Dhabi-based head of investment at Royal Capital. “There is also
a perception that the Egyptian market will stabilize sooner than
expected.”  Saudi Arabia ’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  rose 0.2 percent
after jumping 2.3 percent yesterday as the country created a
ministry for housing. On March 18,  King Abdullah  ordered 250
billion riyals ($67 billion) be spent to construct 500,000
housing units, among measures to quell political protests. Saudi
Arabia’s Shoura consultative council today started a fresh
debate on a draft mortgage law.  The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  gained 0.2 percent and
Bahrain’s BB All Share Index advanced 0.3 percent.  Abu Dhabi ’s
 ADX General Index (ADSMI)  rose 0.5 percent, while Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30) 
slipped 0.2 percent. Kuwait’s measure was little changed.  In  Israel , the TA-25 Index rose 2 percent to 1,305.70, the
biggest gain since Nov. 15. The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit
government bond due January 2020 fell, pushing the yield on the
5 percent bond up 5 basis points to 5.34 percent, the highest
since the bond was issued in November 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
