XTO Energy Inc. is releasing gases
at its Russell Compressor Station in Seminole,  Texas , after
Targa Resources Partners LP shut-in a natural gas plant,
according to a filing with state regulators.  “Targa shut-in and is unable to accept our produced
natural gas from this location until further notice, according
to the  filing . “Flaring is being used to minimize emissions
until the problems at the downstream Targa plant are resolved.”  The incident began at 6 a.m. yesterday and is scheduled to
last until 6 a.m. tomorrow, according to the filing. The
compressor facility is in Seminole, about 74 miles (119
kilometers) northwest of Midland, Texas, near the New Mexico
state line.  The facility released butane, carbon monoxide, hydrogen
sulfide, nitrogen dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere,
according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
