The week’s parties sped by with
tributes to the Indianapolis 500,  Japan , and 651 quilts. The
photographs here sum it up, or read more in the Scene Last Night
 links  gathered below.  The  Indianapolis 500  hosted an event at the Classic Car
Club, drawing Mario Andretti and drivers in this year’s race,
Ryan Briscoe, Simona de Silvestro, and Helio Castroneves.  Hilary Swank and Michael Stipe were among the glitterati
who came out to  EN Japanese Brasserie  to raise money for Japan
relief efforts. Wynton Marsalis performed and beef tongue was
served.  At the Asia Society gala, Charles Rockefeller and  Henry
Kissinger  mingled with  guests  in kimonos and saris to celebrate
Asia Week’s full slate of exhibitions and auctions.  And to go along with the red and white  quilts  on display at
the Park Avenue Armory, the American Folk Art Museum’s kickoff
party for the exhibition featured red and white attire and food
(from lobster to strawberries to wine jelly). Richard D.
Parsons, in a navy suit, said he “didn’t get the memo about the
dress code.”  (Amanda Gordon is a writer and photographer for Muse, the
