ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. (ACL) 
plans to proceed with its acquisition of Imperial Crown Trading
289 Ltd., the company awarded the right to a portion of  Kumba
Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO) ’s Sishen mine, the steelmaker said.  The steelmaker denied a report by the Johannesburg-based
Sunday Times saying ArcelorMittal  South Africa  was considering
pulling out of the deal.  “It’s probably a speculation,” Themba Hlengani, manager
of corporate communications for ArcelorMittal South Africa, said
by phone today. “The transaction is still on the go. Nothing
has changed, the process is still under way.”  ArcelorMittal South Africa offered to buy ICT for 800
million rand ($113 million) to get the prospecting rights to
21.4 percent of the output of Sishen mine at cost plus 3
percent. The mine is South Africa’s largest iron ore deposit.  South Africa awarded the Sishen right to ICT in March last
year after it reverted to the state from ArcelorMittal South
Africa. ICT’s only asset is the Sishen prospecting franchise.
Kumba, a unit of  Anglo American Plc (AGL) , owns the rest of the mine’s
rights.  ICT director Phemelo Sehunelo could not be reached for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
