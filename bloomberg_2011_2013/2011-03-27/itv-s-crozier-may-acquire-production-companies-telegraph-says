ITV Plc (ITV) , the U.K.’s biggest
commercial broadcaster, is considering acquisitions to bolster
its in-house production operations, the  Sunday Telegraph 
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Adam Crozier.  “There are a number of on-screen talents that set up their
own production companies because they had lost trust in ITV
Studios,” Crozier, who became CEO a year ago, is cited as
saying. “We hope to bring some of them back into the fold. Over
time we may need to look at some acquisitions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
