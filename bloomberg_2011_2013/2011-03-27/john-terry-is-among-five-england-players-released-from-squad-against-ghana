Captain  John Terry  was among five
players released from  England ’s soccer squad to play Ghana in an
exhibition match in two days.  Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole, Wayne Rooney and Michael Dawson
are also returning to their clubs after playing in the 2-0 win
over Wales yesterday in a Euro 2012 qualifier in Cardiff, the
Football Association said.  All five are likely to be involved in Champions League
games for their teams in the coming weeks.  Terry’s exit means a new captain will need to be chosen
against Ghana at Wembley. Terry regained the role for the Wales
game in place of  Rio Ferdinand , who’s currently injured.  Yesterday’s win means England tops Group G in Euro 2012
qualifying. It has 10 points after four games, leading
Montenegro on goal difference.        To contact the editor responsible for this story:
