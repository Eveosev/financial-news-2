Southern Cross Healthcare Ltd. (SCHE)  told
landlords that own a third of its 752 care homes that it is
switching to monthly rent payments from quarterly as it seeks to
stave off default, the Sunday Times reported today, without
saying where it got the information.  The company, which said March 14 it may breach its banking
covenants, may ask landlords to accept a 20 percent cut in rent,
deferrals and payments in shares rather than cash, the newspaper
said.  Click here for web link.   To contact the reporter on this story:
