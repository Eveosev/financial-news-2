New Zealand’s Crusaders defeated
South Africa’s Sharks 44-28 in a Super Rugby match in  London 
today.  The game was switched to Twickenham as record seven-time
champion Crusaders are homeless this season following the Feb.
22 Christchurch earthquake. Some of the money raised today, at
the first Super Rugby match staged in the northern hemisphere,
will go toward helping quake victims.   Dan Carter  scored a try and kicked 17 points for Crusaders
before leaving the game injured after 63 minutes. They also got
two tries from Sean Maitland and one each from Israel Dagg and
Zac Guildford. Matt Berquist got one conversion.  Sharks’ try-scorers were Willem Alberts, Jacques-Louis
Potgieter, Alistair Hargreaves and Odwa Ndungane. Potgieter
kicked the remaining points before a crowd of more than 35,000
people.  Crusaders had already won both the home games they were
forced to play away from AMI Stadium, which was damaged in the
magnitude 6.3 temblor. The quake killed more than 160 people and
wrecked buildings in  New Zealand ’s second-largest city.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
