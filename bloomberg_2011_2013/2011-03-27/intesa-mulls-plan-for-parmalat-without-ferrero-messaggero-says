Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) ,  Italy ’s
second-largest bank, is studying an alternative plan for the
country’s biggest dairy company  Parmalat SpA (PLT)  after Ferrero SpA
reconsidered an investment, daily Il Messaggero reported.  Intesa’s plan may involve Granarolo SpA and financial
partners including a fund formed by  Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) ,
Veneto Banca and Palladio Finanziaria, the Italian newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information. Ferrero
is reconsidering taking a stake in Parmalat because it believes
a takeover needed to keep the company under Italian ownership
would be too expensive, according to Il Messaggero.  To contact the reporter on this story:
