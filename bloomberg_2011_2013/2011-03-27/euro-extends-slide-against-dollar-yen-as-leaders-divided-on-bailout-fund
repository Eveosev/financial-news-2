The euro fell against the dollar
and the yen after European Union leaders failed to solidify a
permanent bailout mechanism during a summit at the end of last
week.  The currency slid to $1.4046 as of 6:38 a.m. in  Tokyo  from
$1.4088 on March 25 in  New York . The euro declined to 114.30 yen
from 114.59.  To contact the reporter on this story:
