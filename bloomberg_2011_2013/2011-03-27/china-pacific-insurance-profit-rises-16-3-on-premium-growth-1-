China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co.，
the nation’s third-biggest insurer, said profit rose 16.3
percent last year as premiums expanded.  Net income climbed to 8.56 billion yuan ($1.3 billion), or
1 yuan a share, from 7.36 billion yuan, or 0.95 yuan a share, a
year earlier, the company said in a statement to the Hong Kong
stock exchange today. That compared with the 7.85 billion yuan
median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Gross written premiums reached 87.9 billion yuan, an
increase of 41.7 percent compared with a year earlier, according
to the statement. The company expects growth in gross written
premiums to slow to more than 15 percent this year.  The previous “explosive growth” in  life insurance  is
ending as a result of urbanization, higher per capita income and
the improving social security system, among other factors, the
company said in its statement. Still, the life insurance
business will continue to maintain rapid growth, it said.  Chairman Gao Guofu boosted premium income last year at pace
10 percentage points faster than the industry average to defend
the company’s shrinking market share. Net investment income was
16.95 billion yuan, an increase of 33 percent over the previous
year, even as the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 14
percent.  This was due to an increase in interest and dividend income,
the company said. Dividend income was 2.72 billion yuan, up from
832 million last year.  -- Henry Sanderson , Zhang Dingmin. Editors: Andreea Papuc, Nerys Avery  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
