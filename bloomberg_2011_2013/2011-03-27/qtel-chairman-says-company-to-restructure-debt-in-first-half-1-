Qatar Telecom QSC, the Persian Gulf
country’s largest company in revenue, will restructure debt in
the first half this year, Chairman Sheikh Abdullah Bin Mohammed
Al Thani said.  “In the first half of the year, we are just restructuring
our debt,” al Thani said at the company’s general assembly
meeting in Doha, Qatar, today. Qtel isn’t refinancing any debt,
Chief Executive Officer Nasser Marafih said today.  The company sold $1.25 billion of 6- and 15-year debt
denominated in U.S. dollars in October last year and closed a $2
billion credit facility in May.  “We were studying all the time our bonds and whenever we
think our debt is high, then we can take action,” al Thani
said. “But for the time being we think we are OK. Our bonds
have a very low interest.”  Qtel shares, down 6 percent this year, rose 0.5 percent to
168 riyals on the Qatar Exchange on March 24. Trading of the
shares was suspended today because of the general assembly
meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
