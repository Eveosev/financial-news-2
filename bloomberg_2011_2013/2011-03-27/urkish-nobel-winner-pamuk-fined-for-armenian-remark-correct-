(Corrects spelling error of Armenians in third paragraph.)  Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk,
winner of the  Nobel Prize  for literature in 2006, was ordered to
pay 6,000 liras ($3,850) for the crime of “insulting
Turkishness,”  Sabah  newspaper reported.  A small claims court in the Sisli district of Istanbul
ordered Pamuk to pay compensation to six plaintiffs for remarks
he made in 2005 that were published in a Swiss newspaper
supplement, Sabah said.  “Thirty thousand Kurds and one million Armenians have been
killed on this land, and nobody dares to talk about it,” Pamuk
had said, referring to  Turkey . “So I do.”  Among those who will receive compensation is Kemal
Kerincsiz, a nationalist lawyer later arrested on suspicion of
being a leader of the alleged “Ergenekon” coup conspiracy
against Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan , Sabah said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
