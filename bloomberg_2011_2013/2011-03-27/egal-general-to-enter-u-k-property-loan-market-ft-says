Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN)  is
preparing to begin lending money in the U.K. commercial property
market as traditional bank lending remains subdued, the
Financial Times reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The insurer has asked Ashley Goldblatt, from its fixed
income team, to draw up a strategy for the company to invest in
real estate debt, the FT reported, citing a Legal & General
spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
