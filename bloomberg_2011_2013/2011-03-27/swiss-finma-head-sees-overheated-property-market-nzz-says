Switzerland ’s property market has
overheated in certain cities and the ingredients for a property
bubble exist, NZZ am Sonntag  reported , citing Anne Heritier
Lachat, the head of the country’s financial regulator, Finma.  Interest rates  have been low for a prolonged period of
time, less weight is being attached to property prices and
demand outstrips supply in many places, Lachat said in an
interview in today’s newspaper.  The Finma head also said too-big-to-fail proposals for the
country’s banks should be introduced “essentially” in their
current form and “as quickly as possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
