Colombia  plans to spend more of its
oil royalties on agriculture and infrastructure, said Finance
Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry. Money from increased oil output
will go to a sovereign wealth fund that will focus on
agriculture, roads and bridges, Echeverry said at a conference
today in Calgary. Colombia lags behind neighboring countries in
developing food exports, partly because of its history shipping
illegal drugs, he said. The shift to agriculture reduces the
threat of “dutch disease” when foreign investment increases
the value of the local currency and curbs exports, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
