The  European Commission  will make a
decision about the future of German lender WestLB AG by the
middle of April,  Focus  magazine reported today, citing people
close to the European Union parliament.  The Commission will likely  limit the bank’s activities to
services for German savings banks, the magazine said in the e-
mailed preview of a report to be published tomorrow. WestLB’s
balance sheet will shrink to 40 billion euros ($56 billion) and
50 billion euros, the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
