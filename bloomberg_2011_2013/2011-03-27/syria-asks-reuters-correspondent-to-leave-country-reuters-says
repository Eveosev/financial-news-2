A Reuters correspondent based in
Damascus was asked to leave the country by the Information
Ministry for his “unprofessional and false” reporting of
events in  Syria ,  Reuters said .  Khaled Yacoub Oweis, a Jordanian national who has been
based in Syria since February 2006, had his accreditation
withdrawn and was asked to leave the Arab country late on March
25, the  news agency  reported today on its website, citing the
senior correspondent. Reuters said it stood by its coverage of
the country.  Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad’s security forces clashed
with protesters in several cities yesterday after his promises
of freedoms and pay increases failed to prevent dissent from
spreading across the country.  To contact the reporters on this story:
