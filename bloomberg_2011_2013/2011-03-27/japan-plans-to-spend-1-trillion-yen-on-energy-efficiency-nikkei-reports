Japan  plans to secure about 1
trillion yen ($12.3 billion) in the April supplementary budget
to implement measures to bolster  energy efficiency  to ease post-
quake power shortages, the Nikkei newspaper reported.  The trade ministry may allocate about 100 billion yen
to extend the eco-points program, which encourages consumers to
buy more energy-efficient goods, in the greater Tokyo and
northern areas, Nikkei reported, without saying where it got the
information. The government may also invest as much as 400
billion yen to subsidize installation of solar power systems, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
