The  Bank of England  should keep its
key interest rate on hold this week as the U.K. recovery remains
“fragile,” the British Chambers of Commerce said.  “Positive news should not lull us into a misguided sense
of complacency,” BCC Chief Economist  David Kern  said in an e-
mailed statement from London today. “The economy is still
fragile.”  Manufacturing and services reports this month indicated the
U.K. recovery may have reignited after the economy contracted in
the fourth quarter. While inflation is almost twice the central
bank’s 2 percent target, the BCC said raising the benchmark
interest rate “risks derailing the recovery.” The bank is due
to announce its policy decision on Feb. 10 at 12 p.m.  U.K. inflation accelerated to 3.7 percent in December, and
the BCC forecasts that the rate will rise “toward 4.5 percent”
due to energy and food prices. This will be “temporary” and
the bank must “hold its nerve” until at least the middle of
the year, the group said.  All 62 economists in a Bloomberg News survey forecast the
bank to leave the key rate at a record low of 0.5 percent this
week. It will also maintain its bond-purchase program at 200
billion pounds ($322 billion), according to another survey.  The outlook has prompted investors to add to bets on a rate
increase. The implied yield on December 2011 short sterling
futures has risen 40 basis points this year to 1.65 percent.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. on Feb. 3 brought forward its forecast for
the first rate increase to May from August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
