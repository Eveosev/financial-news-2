A 49-year-old Belgian has set a
record by running 365 marathon races in a year, the British
Broadcasting Corp.  reported .  Stefaan Engels, who started his challenge a year ago, has
run a marathon every day, across seven countries, totaling about
15,000 kilometers (9,300 miles), the BBC said. His average time
for each marathon was four hours, according the  BBC .  Akinori Kusuda of Japan held the previous record for
consecutive marathons, running 52 races in a row in 2009, the
BBC reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
