Qatar’s central bank asked
conventional banks in the country to stop offering Islamic
banking services, two people familiar with the matter said.  The central bank’s circular to banks on Feb. 1 said that
non-Shariah compliant banks must close Islamic branches by year-
end and stop taking deposits in those units immediately, said
one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
directive has not been made public yet. Officials at the central
bank declined to comment when called today.  Qatari banks including  Qatar National Bank SAQ ,  Commercial
Bank of Qatar , Doha Bank and International Bank of Qatar have
Islamic banking divisions. Officials at Qatar National Bank and
Doha Bank weren’t available for comment immediately.  Al Sharq reported the story earlier, without saying how it
obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Robert Tuttle  in Doha at
