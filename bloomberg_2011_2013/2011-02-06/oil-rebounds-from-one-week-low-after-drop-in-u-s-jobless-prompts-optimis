Oil rose for the first time in three
days in  New York  as an unexpected decline in the jobless rate in
the U.S. bolstered optimism fuel demand will increase in the
world’s biggest crude-consuming nation.  Futures retraced some of the 1.7 percent decline posted
Feb. 4 after the Labor Department said that unemployment dropped
in January to 9 percent from December’s 9.4 percent. Employers
added 36,000 workers, short of the 146,000 median gain projected
by economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Oil’s getting a little bit of support from the jobs
data,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity
Broking Services Pty in Sydney. “The unemployment number is
good, but the increase in jobs isn’t. It’s probably a bit of a
knee-jerk reaction from  Asia .”  The March contract gained as much as 47 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $89.50 a barrel, in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $89.38 at 12:02 p.m. Sydney
time. It declined $1.51 to settle at $89.03 on Feb. 4, the
lowest since Jan. 27. Prices fell 0.4 percent last week and are
up 24 percent the past year.    Brent crude  for March settlement added 65 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $100.48 a barrel, on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. It declined $1.93, or 1.9 percent, to end the
session at $99.83 on Feb. 4.  Egyptian natural gas exports to Israel and Jordan may be
halted for as long as two weeks after an explosion damaged a
pipeline in the Sinai Desert Feb. 5, Egyptian Oil Minister  Sameh Fahmy  told state television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
