Japanese stock futures and Australian
shares rose after earnings climbed and the U.S. unemployment
rate unexpectedly dropped, boosting confidence in a global
economic recovery.  American depositary receipts of Advantest Corp., the
world’s biggest maker of chip-testing equipment, gained 0.5
percent from the closing share price in Tokyo on Feb. 4. Those
of Sega Sammy Holdings Inc., a maker of video-game and pachinko
machines, climbed 3.5 percent after the company said nine-month
profit rose.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , Australia’s biggest
lender by market value, increased 0.4 percent in Sydney today.  “Employment in the U.S. is improving steadily, although
the pace is slow,” said  Tomochika Kitaoka , a senior strategist
in Tokyo at Mizuho Securities Co. “If employment keeps
recovering, even if the pace is slow, a sense of security in a
cyclical recovery of the  U.S. economy  will start to spread.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,630 in Chicago on Feb. 4, compared with
10,530 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,610 in  Osaka  at 8:05 a.m. local time today. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index gained less than 0.1 percent today, and  New
Zealand ’s NZX 50 Index climbed 0.3 percent.  Stock markets in China, Taiwan and Vietnam are closed today
for the Lunar New Year holiday.  U.S. Unemployment  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed today.
The index advanced 0.3 percent on Feb. 4 in  New York  to the
highest close since June 2008 after the Labor Department said
the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 9 percent in January from 9.4
percent in December. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had
expected an increase to 9.5 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 1.3 percent this year
to the last close, compared with gains of 4.2 percent by the S&P
500 and 3.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 14.1 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.7 times for the  S&P 500  and 11.3 times
for the Stoxx 600.  The yen depreciated to as low as 82.29 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 81.58 at the close of  stock
trading  in Tokyo on Feb. 4. Against the euro, Japan’s currency
weakened to 111.63 from 111.24. A weaker yen boosts the value of
overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency.  Today, 20 of the 1,019 companies in the MSCI index are
scheduled to release earnings statements. Of the 332 that have
reported results since Jan. 1 for the latest quarter, 134 have
exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 100 have missed them,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
