  Time Warner Inc . may sell part of
IPC Media Ltd., the Sunday Telegraph reported, citing people
familiar with the deliberations whom it didnâ€™t identify.  Sales of blocks of magazines or individual titles are being
considered, the newspaper said. A sale of the whole of IPC is
unlikely and no talks are under way, the U.K. newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
