  Australia  completed a 6-1 series win
against England with a 57-run victory in today’s final one-day
cricket international in Perth.  Adam Voges struck 80 not out from 72 balls to lift
Australia to 279-7 from its 50 overs, then England was bowled
out for 222 with Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson each taking
three wickets.  The teams are preparing for the sport’s 50-over World Cup,
co-hosted by India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, which runs from
Feb. 19 to April 2.  England has a number of injury concerns for the tournament,
with batsman Eoin Morgan, all-rounder Paul Collingwood and
bowlers Graeme Swann and Stuart Broad among those not fit to
play today.    James Anderson  was the pick of England’s bowlers in Perth,
taking 3-48. Liam Plunkett and Mike Yardy each had two wickets,
with Plunkett breaking a 95-run run partnership between Voges
and David Hussey, who scored 60 runs.  Yardy top-scored for England with 60 not out, while openers
Andrew Strauss and Steven Davies both failed to score.  To contact the reporter on this story:
