The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations increased 1.49 cents to $3.13
a gallon, according to a survey.  The price covers the two-week period ended Feb. 4 and is
derived from data provided by 2,500 filling stations nationwide
to  Trilby Lundberg , an independent gasoline analyst in
Camarillo,  California .  “It’s a small add-on to what’s been going on since
September,” when prices started to rise, Lundberg said in a
telephone interview. The gain in gasoline would’ve been higher,
if not for the drop in crude oil, she said.  The front-month crude oil contract dropped 8 cents, or 0.1
percent, in the two weeks, settling at $89.03 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Futures are up 22 percent from a year ago. The current
price of retail gasoline is about 46 cents above the price of
$2.67 a year earlier.  Crude oil may decline this week as U.S. inventories
increase and fuel consumption drops, a Bloomberg News survey
showed.  Fourteen of 31 analysts, or 45 percent, forecast crude oil
will drop through Feb. 11. Twelve respondents, or 39 percent,
predicted prices will climb and five estimated little change.
Last week, 46 percent said futures would decrease.  Oil Supplies  U.S. crude-oil supplies rose 2.59 million barrels to 343.2
million in the week ended Jan. 28, according to an Energy
Department report on Feb. 2.  Crude inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for New York-traded West Texas Intermediate oil, climbed 667,000
barrels to 38.3 million, the highest level since the department
started keeping records at the storage hub in 2004.  Gasoline for front-month delivery lost 1 percent to settle
at $2.4353 a gallon in the two weeks ended Feb. 4.  The U.S. has an “oversupply of gasoline, weak gasoline
demand growth, unemployment and the underuse of refining
capacity,” Lundberg said. “In predicting gasoline price surges
for spring and summer, we have to consider these factors.”  Gasoline Supplies  U.S. gasoline stockpiles rose 6.15 million barrels to 236.2
million barrels in the week ended Jan. 28, the largest total
since March 1993, according to the department. Gasoline demand,
measured by deliveries to wholesalers, fell 1 percent to 8.55
million barrels a day, the lowest level since Feb. 12, 2010.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline averaged $3.38 a gallon,
Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged $3.36 a
gallon.  The highest price in the continental U.S. was in  San
Francisco , at about $3.41 a gallon. The cheapest place to buy
the fuel was  Memphis ,  Tennessee , where a gallon averaged $2.90,
Lundberg said.  Price forecasts of $3.50 and $4 a gallon are
“unrealistic,” Lundberg said. “Gasoline will depend on crude
oil more than anything” and June crude oil futures would only
move the driving fuel about 16 cents higher than its current
level, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
