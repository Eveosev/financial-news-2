Egyptian Vice President  Omar Suleiman 
and representatives from Egypt’s opposition groups agreed to
conclude studying amendments to the constitution by the first
week of March, following anti-government protests that led
President  Hosni Mubarak  to announce he would step down.  The group said they would form a committee to oversee
progress on all constitutional amendments, according to a
cabinet statement distributed to reporters in Cairo today. They
also agreed to defend freedom of the press after many foreign
and local journalists were harassed and attacked last week while
covering the protests in Cairo.  The groups agreed to reject foreign intervention in
domestic politics, and to ease the long-standing emergency law
if the domestic situation permits, according to the statement.  Suleiman met with leaders of the Tagammu and Wafd parties,
as well as with the  Muslim Brotherhood , and businessman Naguib
Sawiris in an effort to piece the government back together after
Mubarak fired his cabinet and announced he would resign in
September. The opposition was previously limited in its efforts
to contest elections or take a role in the country’s mainstream
politics.  The emergency law in  Egypt , which was introduced after the
1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat, was issued a two-
year extension last year, lawmakers accepting the government’s
warning of “persistent” terrorist threats.  The vice president also plans to meet with youth from the 6
April Movement later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
