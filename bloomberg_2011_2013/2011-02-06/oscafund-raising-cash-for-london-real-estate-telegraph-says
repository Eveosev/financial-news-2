Toscafund Ltd. is raising several 100
million-pound ($161-million) funds with 50 million pounds of
equity in each of them to invest in London luxury real estate,
The Sunday Telegraph reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The Tosca Property Fund, which adheres to Islamic financial
law, will invest in locations including Kensington,
Knightsbridge, Belgravia and Mayfair, the newspaper said. It is
open only to Middle East investors with a minimum contribution
of 1 million pounds each, the Telegraph said. The fund will be
managed by Christopher Bodker, the founder of Image Restaurants,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
