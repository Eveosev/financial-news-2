  Australia ’s dollar rose to an almost
nine-month high against the yen as job advertisements climbed,
signaling the economy is gaining momentum.  The  New Zealand dollar  strengthened against the yen after
Prime Minster John Key said the economy will “will be better”
this year and forecasters bet the construction industry will
improve. Australia’s gains were tempered by retail sales data
for December, which showed a smaller gain than forecast.  “The job market in Australia is going to be tight,” said
Takuya Kawabata, a researcher at Gaitame.com Research Institute
Ltd., a unit of Japan’s largest foreign-exchange margin company
in Tokyo. “That’s supportive of the Aussie. The market’s focus
will be on employment data this week.”  Australia’s currency rose 0.3 percent to 83.60 yen at 1:51
p.m. in  New York , from 83.32 on Feb. 4. It touched 83.71, the
strongest since May 13. The Aussie appreciated 0.1 percent to
$1.0150, from $1.0138.    New Zealand ’s dollar advanced 0.4 percent to 63.55 yen,
from 63.28 last week. It gained 0.2 percent to 77.19 U.S. cents.  Jobs advertised in newspapers and on the Internet climbed
2.4 percent in January from December, when they increased a
revised 1.2 percent, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
said in a report released in  Melbourne .  Australian employers added 17,500 workers last month after
a 2,300 increase in December, according to a Bloomberg News
survey before a Bureau of Statistics report due at 7:30 p.m. New
York time on Feb. 9.  Retail sales in Australia increased 0.2 percent in December
after a revised 0.4 percent gain the previous month, the
statistics agency said today in Sydney. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg predicted a 0.5 percent increase.  ‘Fairly Anemic’  New Zealand’s economic growth was “fairly anemic” over
the past six months and will be better this year, Key told
reporters in a briefing today.  New Zealand’s  construction industry  is expected to improve
this year, led by alterations and new home building, according
to BIS Shrapnel Pty, a Sydney-based forecaster. The value of
home-building approvals will rise by 5 percent in the year
ending March 31, the forecaster said in a statement e-mailed to
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
