Denmark’s Thomas Bjorn won the Qatar
Masters today by four shots for his 11th European Tour victory,
while  Martin Kaymer  of Germany missed an opportunity to top the
world golf rankings after finishing 28th.  Bjorn, 39, finished on 14-under-par 274 in Doha after a
final-round 69 which included three birdies at the last four
holes. Spain’s Alvaro Quiros was 10-under, with countryman
Rafael Cabrera-Bello and Austria’s Markus Brier a further shot
back.  Bjorn collects a check for 303,114 euros ($411,660) for his
first European Tour victory since the Estoril Open in June. The
Dane had only won about 9,000 euros from his other two
tournaments this year.  Kaymer will remain at No. 2 in the golf rankings after he
failed to secure a top-two finish which he needed to oust
England’s  Lee Westwood  from top spot. Westwood failed to make
the cut two days ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:  James Cone  in London at
