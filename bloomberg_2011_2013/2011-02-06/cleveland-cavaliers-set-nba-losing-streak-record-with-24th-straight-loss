The  Cleveland Cavaliers , who haven’t
won since Dec. 18, lost their National Basketball Association
record-setting 24th straight game last night, 111-105, to the
Portland Trail Blazers.  The losing streak, which includes 15 losses of 10 or more
points, surpassed the record for a single season set by the
1995-96 Memphis Grizzlies and matched by the 1997-98 Denver
Nuggets.  The Cavaliers tied the game at 94-94 on Jamario Moon’s free
throw with seven minutes, 50 seconds left in the game. Portland
responded with nine unanswered points to drive up the score to
103-94 in the next three minutes. During the final seven seconds
the Cavaliers missed two 3-pointers.  Wesley Matthews scored 31 points and Nicolas Batum added 21
for the Trail Blazers (27-24) at Quicken Loans Arena in  Cleveland .  The Cavaliers (8-43), who had seven players in double-
digits, were led by Antawn Jamison with 17 points and Ramon Sessions with 15.  Last season, seven-time All-Star forward  LeBron James  led
the Cavaliers to the Eastern Conference semifinals for the fifth
straight season. James, a native of Akron, Ohio, became a free
agent during the offseason and in July declined to re-sign with
the Cavaliers, instead joining Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh with
the  Miami Heat .  The Cavaliers are in last place of the five-team Central
division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
