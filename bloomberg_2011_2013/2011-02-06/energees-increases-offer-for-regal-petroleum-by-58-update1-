Energees Management Ltd. increased
its offer for  Regal Petroleum Plc ., a U.K. explorer, by 58
percent to 38 pence a share.  The companies have reached agreement on the terms of the
offer for up to about 70 percent of Regal for about 85 million
pounds ($137 million), Energees said in a statement today.
Regal’s shares closed at 31.25 pence in London on Jan. 17.  Energees had offered 24 pence a share for Regal on Dec 10.
Energees is jointly controlled by Vadim Novinskiy and Andrey
Klyamko, and is the principal holding company of the Smart
Holding Group, a Ukrainian company. Smart also has interests in
companies including Metinvest Holding LLC, Ukraine’s largest
steelmaker.  “The increased partial offer will result in the Smart
Holding Group obtaining majority ownership of Regal,” Energees
said. The new offer runs until Feb. 20 and has already received
Ukrainian anti-trust clearance, it said.  Smart Holding Group hopes that keeping a portion of Regal
listed in  London  will build the Ukrainian company’s reputation
with international investors, ahead of a possible public sale of
shares in Metinvest Holding LLC, Denis Rudov, Smart’s chief
financial officer, said on a conference call today.  “The sooner we start building a track record in the public
markets the better,” Rudov said. Shares in Metinvest will be
offered for public sale “at some point in time,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
