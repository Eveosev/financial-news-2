  Hong Kong ’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at all three roadside monitoring stations today, the
city’s Environmental Protection Department said on its website.  The index was 134 in  Causeway Bay , 101 in Central and 115
in  Mong Kok  as of 6 a.m., the department said. Roadside
pollution readings above 100 trigger a government warning for
people with heart or respiratory illnesses to avoid prolonged
stays in heavy traffic areas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
