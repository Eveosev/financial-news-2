Azerbaijan  officially bid for co-
hosting the 2020 European Football Championship with neighboring
Georgia after the Caspian Sea nation was dropped from the list
of applicants for the 2020 Olympics.  “Unjustly, Azerbaijan was not shortlisted,” Rovnaq Abdullayev, president of the Association of Football Federations
of Azerbaijan, or AFFA, told reporters in Baku yesterday. “We
applied to co-host the European championship together with
Georgia.”  The  International Olympic Committee  announced the shortlist
on May 23, cutting Baku and Doha. Istanbul, Tokyo and Madrid
will compete to host the 2020  Olympic Games . The winner will be
elected on Sept. 7, 2013, in Buenos Aires.  Energy-rich Azerbaijan’s capital is currently playing host
to the Eurovision Song Contest, the world’s most-watched music
competition, with the final planned for tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
