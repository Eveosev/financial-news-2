India ’s benchmark bonds completed a
fourth weekly gain on speculation debt purchases by the central
bank will spur demand.  The  Reserve Bank  of India bought 112 billion rupees ($2
billion) of sovereign notes at an open-market auction today,
according to a statement. Separately, the  finance ministry  sold
150 billion rupees of securities, part of its 5.69 trillion
rupees borrowing program for the 12 months through March 2013.  “The open-market buying of debt is helping keep yields
down,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at
Development Credit Bank in Mumbai.  The yield on the 8.79 percent notes due November 2021
dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, this week to
8.51 percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. It rose one basis point today.  The central bank has bought 321 billion rupees of notes
since March as its dollar sales aimed at stemming the slide in
the rupee drained funds from the financial system. The rupee
touched a record low of 56.3875 per dollar yesterday.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose four basis
points this week to 8.02 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate is little changed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
