AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s  American Airlines  can be
strong as a standalone company and doesn’t need a merger with US
Airways Group Inc. to survive, a lawyer for American said in
court.  American needs a competitive cost structure, and union
support for a merger shouldn’t factor into a judge’s
consideration of American’s request to reject union contracts,
attorney Jack Gallagher said today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan.  “The suggestion that there is a transaction likely with US
Airways is wholly speculative, wishful thinking,” Gallagher
said.  American and unions representing pilots, flight attendants
and mechanics are in court today for closing arguments over
AMR’s request to void labor contracts.  The case is In re AMR Corp., 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan)  To contact the reporter on this story:
