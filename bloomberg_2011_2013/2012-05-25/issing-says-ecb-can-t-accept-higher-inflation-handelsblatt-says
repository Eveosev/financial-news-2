Former European Central Bank Chief
Economist  Otmar Issing  said the ECB shouldn’t give in to calls
of temporarily allowing higher inflation to ease countries’
reform efforts,  Handelsblatt  newspaper reported.  While Germany can make a big contribution to reducing
current-account imbalances in the region with stronger-than-
average growth and inflation, exaggerated wage increases would
before long result in rising unemployment and slower growth,
Issing said in an opinion piece published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
