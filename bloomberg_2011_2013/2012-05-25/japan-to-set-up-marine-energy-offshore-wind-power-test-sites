Japan  will set up test sites for
marine energy and offshore wind power to increase the use of
renewable sources following the nuclear disaster last year.  Applications will be sought from local administrations and
the first group of test sites will be picked by March 2014, a
task force on ocean policy headed by Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said today in a statement. The nation is taking a cue from
the European Marine Energy Center, a Scottish test facility for
wave and tidal technologies, Yoshikiyo Ono, a cabinet
secretariat official, said at a briefing today.  “Our country’s use of marine renewable energy is extremely
limited and technology development is also far behind compared
with Europe and the U.S.,” the  task force  said. “Marine
renewable energy is important for our future  energy policy .”  Japan, once the world’s largest user of nuclear power after
the U.S. and France, has all of its 50 reactors offline as the
country runs safety tests following the Fukushima atomic
disaster.  The government plans to set up several sites to test
different technologies, Ono said. The number of locations to be
picked for the first year has yet to be decided, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
