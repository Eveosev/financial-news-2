International Securities Exchange LLC
lost its appeal of a court order barring it from providing a
forum for the trading of  S&P 500  and Dow Jones Industrial
Average index options.  CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) , the parent of the  Chicago Board Options
Exchange  and  McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP)  sued the exchange in 2006 to block
it from competing with them. Judge William O. Maki in Chicago
barred it from featuring the listings in July 2010, ruling that
the CBOE has an exclusive license to offer options based on the
S&P 500. The index is a licensed product of McGraw-Hill’s
Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC.  The Illinois Appellate Court today upheld the injunction,
rejecting International Securities’ appeal. The exchange’s
“proposed actions constitute misappropriation in Illinois,”
the court said. Today’s ruling also bars the Options Clearing
Corp. from clearing options on these indexes unless they’re
traded under CBOE licenses.  “We are obviously gratified that the court has ruled in
CBOE’s favor,” William J. Brodsky, the CBOE chairman, said in a
press release. “No third party should be able to interfere with
contractual licensing agreements. Nor should any exchange have a
free ride on the enormous investment CBOE made in creating
options on these indexes and marketing them for over two
decades.”  ISE is considering what it will do next, Molly McGregor, a
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. “We will evaluate all of the
options to determine next steps but have no additional comment
at this time,” she said.  The case is  Chicago  Board of Options Exchange v.
International Securities Exchange LLC, 1-10-2228, Illinois
Appellate Court (Chicago).
