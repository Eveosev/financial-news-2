A Ukrainian court upheld a March
ruling to restore government control over the Zaporizhskyi
aluminum smelter, rejecting an appeal by Russian billionaire
 Oleg Deripaska ’s  United Co. Rusal. (486)   Kiev’s economic court of appeal supported the decision to
overturn a sale agreement and return a 68.01 percent stake in
Rusal’s plant to Ukraine’s state property fund, the prosecutor-
general’s office said today on its website.  Prosecutors have claimed the Russian company refused to
refinance $75.5 million of debt owed by the plant, known as
Zalk, and violated the rights of the state property fund.  Rusal will appeal to Ukraine’s supreme economic court, a
spokesperson said by e-mail, declining to be identified.  To contact the reporters on this story:
