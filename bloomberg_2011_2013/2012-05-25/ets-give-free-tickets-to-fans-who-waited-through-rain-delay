The  New York  Mets rewarded fans who
waited through a 68-minute rain delay with tickets to tonightâ€™s
Major League Baseball game against the  San Diego Padres .  The Mets lost 11-5 after the weather interruption in the
top of the third inning at Citi Field.  Vinny Rottino gave the Mets (24-21) a 1-0 lead in the
second inning when he raced home on a throwing error by catcher
Nick Hundley. When the game resumed, the Padres (17-29) scored
six runs in the third and fourth innings before David Wright hit
a two-run homer to narrow the gap to 6-3.  The Padres added five more runs in the seventh, eighth and
ninth innings, with  Ike Davis  driving in two runs for the Mets
in the eighth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
