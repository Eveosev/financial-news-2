Kenya ’s shilling gained for the
second day this week as the central bank withdrew money from the
market through repurchase agreements to support the currency.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.2 percent to 85.15 by 1:21 p.m., in the capital,
Nairobi.  Kenya’s central bank accepted all 6.2 billion shillings
($73 million) of bids for seven-day repurchase agreements at
17.792 percent, after offering 8 billion shillings, an official,
who declined to be identified in line with policy, said in a
phone interview today.  “The shilling has halted its losing streak due to tight
liquidity conditions in the market with overnight interbank
rates touching 20 percent”, Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said in
a note to investors. “The shilling is expected to still be
under pressure against the dollar as demand remains strong,
although exporters may take advantage of the shilling
weakness.”  Tanzania’s shilling gained 0.3 percent to 1,588 to the
dollar, while the Ugandan shilling appreciated 0.5 percent to
2,485 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
