Statoil ASA (STL)  said it wouldn’t comment
on reports it may be replaced by  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  in
 Russia ’s offshore Shtokman gas project and that it’s still
working with its partners to make it economically viable.  “We have a constructive cooperation with our partners,”
 Gazprom OAO (GAZP)  and Total SA, said spokesman Baard Glad Pedersen in
a phone interview in Oslo today. We “are working with them to
realize the project,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
