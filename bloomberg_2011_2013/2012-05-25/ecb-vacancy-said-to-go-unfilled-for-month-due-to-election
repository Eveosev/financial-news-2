A vacancy on the  European Central
Bank  will go unfilled for at least a month after  France ’s
presidential election snarled high-level European appointments,
two officials said.  Euro-area finance ministers won’t meet until June 21 to
name a successor to Spain’s Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo, who
steps down from the ECB’s six-member Executive Board at the end
of May.  At a meeting in March, the ministers deadlocked over two
candidates: Luxembourg Central Bank Governor Yves Mersch and
Spain’s Antonio Sainz de Vicuna, head of the ECB’s legal
department. The appointment was part of a personnel package that
the European Union then decided to put off until after France’s
presidential election, won by  Francois Hollande  on May 6.  A decision on the ECB post at the finance ministers’ June
meeting would require a formal rubber-stamp by the  European
Parliament , which wouldn’t come before July 2. A continued
stalemate could leave the ECB board one person short until
September, said the officials, who declined to be identified
under EU policy.  “It’s a bit of a merry-go-round,”  Francois Baroin , the
finance minister in France’s previous government, said at the
inconclusive March 30 meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
