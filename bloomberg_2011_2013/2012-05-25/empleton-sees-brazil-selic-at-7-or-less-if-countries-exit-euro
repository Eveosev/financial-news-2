Brazil ’s benchmark Selic interest
rate may fall to 7 percent or less and the dollar could rise to
more than 2.40 reais if two or more countries leave the
Eurozone, creating a “rupture” in the global economy, said
Carlos Thadeu de Freitas Gomes Filho, senior economist at
Franklin Templeton Investimentos Brasil.  “The external environment is deflationary and commodity
prices are going to fall,” said Gomes Filho in a telephone
interview from  Rio de Janeiro . “This opens space for the
central bank to cut  interest rates . The central bank is on the
right path, despite changing its signals very quickly.”  Brazil’s central bank has lowered the Selic by 350 basis
points since August to shield the country’s economic growth from
the effects of  Europe ’s debt crisis and a Chinese slowdown.
After cutting the Selic to 9 percent in April, the central bank
said further cuts would be “conducted with parsimony”. Traders
expect the bank’s monetary policy committee, or Copom, to reduce
the benchmark rate by another 0.5 percentage point at its
meeting next week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Government measures to boost the Brazilian economy will
have little effect and expansion is likely to slow to 2.5
percent this year because of the global crisis, Gomes Filho
said.  A Greek exit from the Eurozone could trigger a deepening of
the crisis, leading to a “rupture” in the international
economy, although the Greek situation alone would not have this
effect, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
