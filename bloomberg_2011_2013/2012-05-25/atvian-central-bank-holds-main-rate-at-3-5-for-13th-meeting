Latvia’s central bank left borrowing
costs unchanged for a 13th meeting as inflation risks eased
after parliament lowered the  sales tax  by one percentage point.  Latvijas Banka  kept the benchmark refinancing rate at 3.5
percent, Governor Ilmars Rimsevics told a news conference today
in the capital, Riga.  “In view of the relatively rapid economic growth observed
in the last quarters and the gradual improvement in lending,
against the background of moderate medium-term risks to  price
stability , the Council of the Bank of Latvia has assessed the
current monetary policy conditions as consistent with the
economic situation,” the bank said in an e-mailed statement.  The  economy , which expanded a preliminary 6.8 percent from
a year earlier in the first quarter, may grow about 3.5 percent
this year as the euro area’s debt crisis weighs on exports,
according to the  International Monetary Fund . Inflation slowed
to 2.8 percent from a year earlier last month compared with 3.3
percent in March.  Latvia completed a 7.5 billion-euro ($9.4 billion) bailout
from a group led by the European Union and the IMF in December.
The country, which fixes its currency to the euro, plans to
adopt Europe’s common currency in 2014 and must meet criteria on
inflation, interest rates,  budget deficit  and government debt.  The refinancing rate affects the minimum  interest rate  on
central bank swaps and repurchase agreements, worth about 75
million lati ($135 million) a week. The bank runs a quasi-
currency-board system, pegged to the euro, where lati in
circulation are backed by foreign currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
