(Corrects to remove incorrect title in headline.)  Jonathan Faull , the European
Commission’s director general for financial services, said the
European Union is “reasonably well advanced” in preparing
regulations to head off the next financial crisis.  He was speaking at the International Capital Markets
Association conference in Milan.  On unintended consequences of regulation:  “We need to avoid unintended consequences, to bring about
intended consequences and to make sure that when the next crisis
happens in three thousand-and-something, our descendants have a
robust and effective toolbox to deal with it.”  On so-called shadow banking:  “We are in a consultation phase on ideas for regulation in
the shadow-banking sector which will last until June 15.  “Repos are clearly part of the process of maturity
transformation and a strong view was also expressed that  money
market funds , particularly with a constant net asset value,
require a stronger regulatory framework than they have today.  “We will have to make up our minds sometime in the last
quarter of this year how to go forward on shadow banking, again
watching carefully what our main international partners are
doing.”  On the importance of investor protection:  “The protection of investors is a very necessary
complement to all that we’re doing otherwise to restore
stability and confidence in financial markets.”  On growth and stability:  “We think it’s palpably clear that we need both stability
and growth and that stability and growth need and feed off each
other.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
