Denizbank AS (DENIZ)  plunged the most on
record after owner  Dexia SA (DEXB)  said it had entered exclusive
negotiations with Russia’s  OAO Sberbank (SBER)  to sell the unit for a
price below the current market value.  The shares fell 20 percent to 14.20 liras at the close in
Istanbul, their biggest loss since at least 2004.  The Moscow-based lender may agree to pay as much as 1.5
times Denizbank’s book value, valuing the bank at about $4
billion, said one person close to the deal, who declined to be
identified as the process is private. Denizbank’s current share
price gives it a price-to-book ratio of 2.1, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Dexia’s annual report in April showed Denizbank had a
carrying value at the end of last year of 2.8 billion euros
($3.5 billion), the minimum amount Dexia needs to sell it for to
avoid taking a hit to its capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
