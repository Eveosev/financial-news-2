The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt fell, heading for the first weekly
decline in four weeks.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped
eight basis points to 710.5, at 8:53 a.m. in London, and is down
from 753 last week. A decline signals improvement in perceptions
of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell two basis points to 172.5,
compared with 183 last week.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell six basis points to 288 and the
subordinated index declined seven to 488.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of 15
governments fell five basis points to 311.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.6 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
