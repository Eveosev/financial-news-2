The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default dropped, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index slid 6 basis points to 200
basis points as of 9:26 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The gauge is set for its lowest close since May 11,
according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan declined 2 basis points to 196 basis
points as of 8:37 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The index is headed for its lowest
closing level since May 22, according to CMA, which is owned by
CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index was little changed at 196
basis points as of 11 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC)   Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
