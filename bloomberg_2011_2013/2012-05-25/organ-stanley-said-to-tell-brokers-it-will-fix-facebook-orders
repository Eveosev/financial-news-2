Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the
world’s biggest brokerage, told its financial advisers yesterday
that it will adjust prices on a few thousand client trades of
 Facebook Inc. (FB) , according to a person on the conference call.  The company also told brokers that limit orders to sell
shares for at least $43 each after the social network’s initial
 public offering  won’t be filled because of low volume at that
 price range  on May 18, said the person, who requested anonymity
because the call was private. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney told
brokers May 23 it was reviewing pricing and execution of orders,
according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg.  Nasdaq Stock Market trade confirmations were delayed and
some orders may have been mishandled by the exchange. The IPO
was marred on the first trading day when Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.
was overwhelmed by order cancellations and updates that delayed
trading in Facebook shares. The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission said it will conduct a review.  Facebook’s underwriters had gains of about $100 million
through their work to stabilize the share price since the IPO, a
person familiar with the matter said May 23.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  will
use some of the gains to reimburse clients who lost money
because of glitches in trade execution, the person said.  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, which is owned by Morgan
Stanley and  Citigroup Inc. (C) , had more than 17,000 advisers and
$1.74 trillion of client assets as of March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
