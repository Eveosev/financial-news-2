Cluff Geothermal Ltd., a U.K.-based
company, plans to invest in geothermal exploration and
generation in Uganda, President  Yoweri Museveni ’s office said.  The company, with projects in northeast England and in the
East African Rift Valley, was attracted to Uganda because of its
“big thermal energy potential,” which may generate “cheap and
affordable” electricity, the presidency said in a statement
today from Kampala, the capital. Museveni met  Cluff Geothermal 
Managing Director George Percy yesterday at Kisozi, in Uganda’s
central region.  Uganda, East Africa’s third-biggest economy, has regular
nationwide outages amid a power deficit, with production at 395
megawatts and consumption at as much as 450 megawatts, Julius
Wandera, the spokesman of the state-run Electricity Regulation
Authority, said today in a phone interview from Kampala, the
capital.  Museveni favors government partnerships with private
companies in the  energy industry , according to the statement.
The country plans to spend $13 billion on infrastructure
development, including on energy projects, in the next five
years, his office said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
