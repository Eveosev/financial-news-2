Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  climbed, leading
Czech shares’ first weekly gain this month, as signs of an
easing in the euro area’s financial crisis boosted demand for
riskier assets.  The Austrian company rose 1.6 percent to 375 koruna as of
10:32 a.m. in Prague, taking its weekly advance to 3.3 percent.
The 14-member  PX (PX)  index, where Erste has an 18 percent weighting,
added 0.4 percent today and 1.6 percent this week.  European stocks rose, with lenders and insurers among the
best performers, after Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said
that most leaders support joint bonds for the euro area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
