ICE Futures  Europe , the biggest
exchange for carbon trading, said it might extend a 16-month
suspension of its prompt market as it waits for a software
upgrade at a new European Union registry.  The upgrade will allow traders to set up so-called trusted
accounts in the registry, which tracks ownership of emission
allowances. Without those accounts, which will allow for
streamlined trading, transactions may take as long as seven days
to settle, said David Peniket, the exchange’s president.  “For a daily market, this could be too long for
participants,” he said yesterday by phone from London. “Once
trusted accounts are set up, transactions may be able to settle
in one or two days.”  ICE suspended prompt trading in January last year after
thefts of carbon allowances roiled the market, the world’s
biggest greenhouse-gas-reduction program by traded volume.
BlueNext SA, the Paris spot exchange, reopened for trading Feb.
4 last year.  Settlement of trades from ordinary accounts in the registry
will take so long because allowances must be transferred from
the seller’s account to its clearing member, then to the
clearing house, on to the buyer’s clearing member and then to
its own account, Peniket said. Each transfer may take about 26
hours and may include a new text-message authentication process,
he said.  “Customers would like to have a prompt market available
and we are currently evaluating possible solutions,” Peniket
said.  The European Commission in Brussels, regulator of the
market, said May 3 that the new registry, which combines about
30 registries from countries participating in the market, will
be activated on June 20. A more detailed timetable, including
the upgrade for trusted accounts, will be communicated by July
15. The commission didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment
yesterday on the availability of trusted accounts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
