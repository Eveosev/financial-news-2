Ravi Singh, who oversaw  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN) ’s effort to manage alternative assets such as hedge
funds and private equity, has left after three years at the
bank.  Singh, 44, “decided to leave Credit Suisse to pursue other
opportunities,” according to an internal memo sent last month
by Robert Shafir, who runs asset management at Zurich-based
Credit Suisse. “I will assume responsibility for alternatives
on an interim basis until a replacement is named,” Shafir
wrote.  Suzanne Fleming, a spokeswoman for Credit Suisse in New
York, confirmed the memo’s contents.  Before joining Credit Suisse in 2009, Singh worked at New
York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Financial News reported Singh’s departure from Credit
Suisse May 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
