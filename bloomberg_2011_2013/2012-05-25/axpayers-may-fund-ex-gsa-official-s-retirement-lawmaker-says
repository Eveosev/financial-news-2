Taxpayers may get the
multimillionaire-dollar “retirement tab” for a former U.S.
General Services Administration official who oversaw an $823,000
Las Vegas conference, a U.S. lawmaker said.  The GSA announced without elaboration yesterday that Jeff Neely no longer worked at the agency. He will probably retire
with government payments of more than $100,000 a year,
Representative  John Mica , a Republican from  Florida , said today
in a statement.  Mica, chairman of the House Committee on Transportation,
planned to investigate the terms of Neely’s departure, according
to the statement.  The public shouldn’t have to fund multimillion-dollar deals
for “government administrators who abuse their positions and
snub their noses at Congress and the American people,” it said.  GSA spokesman Adam Elkington would not say today whether
Neely had retired or if he would receive a government pension.  Neely last month refused to testify before Mica’s
committee, citing his Fifth Amendment rights against self-
incrimination. Mica plans to introduce legislation that would
halt salaries for senior administrators who take the Fifth
Amendment in such cases.  U.S. lawmakers have criticized spending at the 2010
conference, which featured a mind reader, a clown and a $75,000
bicycle-building exercise. The GSA’s inspector general has been
investigating other trips and conferences involving agency
employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
