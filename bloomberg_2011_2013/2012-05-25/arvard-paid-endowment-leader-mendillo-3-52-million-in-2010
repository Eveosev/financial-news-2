Harvard University  paid Jane Mendillo, the top endowment manager for the world’s richest
college, $3.52 million in 2010 after encouraging investment
specialists to set longer-term goals.  Mendillo’s pay was third-highest at the endowment, the
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based university said today in a
statement. She received $3.5 million in 2009, according to
disclosures last year. Harvard Management Co.’s top six managers
together were paid $20.4 million in 2010, the latest year
reported, compared with $28.9 million in 2009.  Mendillo, 53, took over during a credit crisis that began
in 2008, during which the fund lost about one-third of its value
after peaking at $36.9 billion. She increased the number of
years over which managers receive incentive compensation and
tied the pay of senior managers to performance of the entire
endowment, according to today’s statement.  The managers “continue to steer the endowment through
challenging markets, returning value to the portfolio and the
University while positioning Harvard’s endowment for the long
term,” James Rothenberg, a member of the governing board and
Harvard’s treasurer, said in the statement.  The investment return was 21.4 percent in the year ended
June 30, 2011, according to Harvard. The value of the fund
climbed $4.4 billion in a year to $32 billion on June 30,
according to a report in September from Harvard Management.  University President Drew Faust, 64, earned $875,000 for
2010, according to a tax filing released today. Faust’s
compensation included $121,000 reflecting the use of a home in
Cambridge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
