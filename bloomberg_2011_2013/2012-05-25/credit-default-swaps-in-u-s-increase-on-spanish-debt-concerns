A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
increased as rating company  Standard & Poor’s  slashed the credit
grade of five Spanish banks.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, rose 0.2 basis point to a mid-price of 117.4
basis points at 4:36 p.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg.  The swaps gauge widened as the Bankia group, the Spanish
lender nationalized earlier this month, said it needs 19 billion
euros ($23.8 billion) of government money to restructure its
business. S&P cut the credit ratings on five Spanish banks,
citing the country’s weakening economy.  The moves followed the downgrade by Moody’s Investors
Service of 16 Spanish banks on May 17, citing concerns about
souring loans, the recession, restricted access to funding and
the reduced ability of the government to back up lenders as its
own creditworthiness suffers.  The swaps gauge typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit swaps pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
