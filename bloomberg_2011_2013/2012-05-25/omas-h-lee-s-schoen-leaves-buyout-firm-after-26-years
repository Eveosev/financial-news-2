Scott Schoen, who helped lead
private-equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners LP from 2003 to 2009
as co-president and has since served as vice chairman, stepped
down from the firm earlier this month.  Schoen, who joined Boston-based Thomas H. Lee in 1986, will
remain an adviser to the firm and a board member of portfolio
companies Acosta Inc. and  Nielsen Holdings NV (NLSN) , the firm said in
a statement today. The 53-year-old, along with co-Presidents
Anthony DiNovi and Scott Sperling, took over top management of
the firm when its billionaire founder, Thomas Lee, stepped down
in 2006.  “I am proud of the franchise we have built, and I am
confident that the firm will realize even greater success in the
future,” Schoen said in the statement.  In a 2009 talk at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Schoen said the private-equity
industry was entering an era in which debt would be harder to
obtain and returns would be lower than they were during the
booms of the 1980s and the middle of last decade. Buyout firms
use debt when they purchase companies as a means of amplifying
the returns on their cash.  “We’re in a brave new world,” Schoen said in his talk.
“We can’t go back to where we were, at least not in this
investment cycle and probably not in my career.”  Schoen began his career at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and
received a master’s in business administration and a law degree
from  Harvard University .  To contact the reporter on this story:
