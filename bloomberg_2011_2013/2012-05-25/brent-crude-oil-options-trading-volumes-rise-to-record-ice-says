Daily trading volumes of Brent oil
options rose to a record 78,508 contracts yesterday, according
to ICE Futures Europe, a unit of Intercontinental Exchange Inc.  The volume surpassed a previous peak of 63,494 lots set on
May 2, ICE said today in an e-mailed statement. Options give
traders the ability, without the obligation, to buy or sell
securities at a designated price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
