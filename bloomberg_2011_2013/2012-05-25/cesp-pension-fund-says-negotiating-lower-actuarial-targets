Fundacao Cesp, the pension fund for
workers of  Cia. Energetica de Sao Paulo , is negotiating lower
actuarial targets with clients as cuts in Brazil’s borrowing
costs and a  bear market  for Brazil stocks cut into returns, said
Euzebio Bomfim, the fund’s director of retirement.  “We have some plans where we still haven’t been able to
convince the participants” to accept lower targets, Bomfim said
in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. “You can’t use targets to
calculate returns that aren’t reachable. It’s not just in terms
of  government bonds , it’s also stocks. There’s great
volatility.”  The Bovespa index plunged into a bear market on May 17 on
concern a worsening global economy will curb demand for
Brazilian exports after a quarter in which most companies
reported earnings that trailed estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
