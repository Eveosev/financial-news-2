Emerging-market stock funds posted
their third consecutive week of outflows as  Europe â€™s debt crisis
and a slowing Chinese economy heightened uncertainty about
equities, according to EPFR Global.  Developing-nation equity funds recorded a net total of
$1.54 billion in redemptions for the week ended May 23,
according to a report e-mailed today by the Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based data provider. Net investment into
developing-nation  equity  funds has totaled $19.25 billion in
2012, compared with outflows of $12.46 billion for the same
period last year.  So-called Global Emerging-Market funds, or GEM funds,
recorded net outflows for the week of $7 million as Asian funds
excluding  Japan  recorded the largest redemptions among emerging
market regional funds, posting a net outflow of $768 million,
 Cameron Brandt , EPFR director of research, said by e-mail today.  Redemptions from Brazil-dedicated funds totaled $245
million pushing outflows from Latin American equity funds to
$527 million, the highest level of outflows since the week ended
Aug. 10. Russia equity funds registered outflows of $92 million.  The average emerging-market equity portfolio posted a 2.54
percent loss for the week, cutting the 2012 advance to 0.46
percent, Brandt said. Emerging-market bond funds registered
outflows of $478 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
