Most Japanese  stocks  fell on concern
European leaders won’t be able to keep  Greece  from exiting the
monetary union and on speculation shares were undervalued. The
 Topix (TPX)  Index declined for an eighth week, its longest losing
streak since November 1977.  Nikon Corp. (7731) , a camera maker that gets almost a quarter of
its revenue from Europe, lost 1.3 percent. JFE Holdings Inc.
sank 3.9 percent after saying its steel unit will withdraw from
solar silicon operations.  Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) , Asia’s largest
cigarette maker by market value, jumped 5.2 percent after
agreeing to buy Gryson NV to boost growth in Europe. Mitsui
Fudosan Co. paced gains among developers on a report Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. will resume real estate investment in  Japan .  ‘‘We’ve seen expectations turn into disappointments over
the past month or so, that’s weighing on Japan’s stocks,” said
Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at Resona Bank Ltd., which
oversees about $188 billion. ‘‘Earning forecasts make you think
that they are not only cautious, but also may actually
deteriorate. It’s like taking away the ladder from investors who
expected a huge rebound in earnings after the earthquake and
Thai floods.”  The Topix slid less than 0.1 percent to 722.11 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , falling 0.5 percent on the week as the gauge
capped its longest losing streak in 34 years. The  Nikkei 225 
Stock Average added 0.2 percent to 8,580.39 after swinging
between gains and losses more than 15 times.  The Topix has plunged 17 percent from this year’s high on
March 27 as  China ’s economic growth slowed, and on renewed
concern about Europe’s debt crisis. Political gridlock in Greece
after an inconclusive election this month reignited concern the
nation will renege on austerity pledges required for 240 billion
euros ($302 billion) in aid and exit the euro.  Pushing Euro Bonds  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.2 percent
today. The gauge added 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday,
reversing a loss of 0.6 percent, after Italian President  Mario
Monti  said in a television interview that Italy can help push
Germany to support the idea of collective debt in the form of
euro bonds to embrace the “common good” of the region.  ‘’Markets are concerned that Greece may leave the euro,”
said Goya Nakao, senior investment manager at Sompo Japan Asset
Management Co. “Investors’ risk aversion will have a double
impact on Japanese markets: money may shift to bonds from stocks
while the yen strengthens, hurting earnings. That’s why declines
in Japanese markets are sharper than overseas.”  Nikon slid 1.3 percent to 2,095 yen.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202) ,
a company that generates almost 40 percent of its sales in
Europe, retreated 2.4 percent to 83 yen.  JFE lost 3.9 percent to 1,256 yen after saying on its
website that unit JFE Steel Corp. will withdraw from the solar
silicon market after prices fell on European demand decline and
competition from Asian makers.  Topix Valuations  Valuations on the Topix have fallen to 0.8 times book value,
compared with 2.1 times for the S&P 500 and 1.3 times for the
Stoxx 600, according to Bloomberg data. A number below one means
companies can be bought for less than value of their assets.  The 25-day Toraku index, which compares advancing and
declining shares, fell to 70.3 yesterday. A reading below 70
suggests stocks are close to　bottoming.  Japan Tobacco gained the most on the Nikkei 225, rising 5.2
percent to 447,500 yen, after the maker of Camel and Mild Seven
cigarettes agreed to pay 475 million euros ($596 million) for
Belgium-based Gryson to boost growth in  Europe ’s roll-your-own
market.  Developers gained after the Nikkei newspaper reported
Goldman Sachs plans to invest in Tokyo office buildings this
summer after a four-year absence from Japan’s property market.  Mitsui Fudosan, the nation’s largest developer by revenue,
rose 1.8 percent to 1,285 yen. Tokyu Land Corp., which had its
equity rating raised to “overweight” by JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
jumped 3.2 percent to 350 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
