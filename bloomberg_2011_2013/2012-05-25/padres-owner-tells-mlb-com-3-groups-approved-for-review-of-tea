Major League Baseball has approved
three potential buyers to review the financial records of the
San Diego Padres, team owner John Moores told MLB.com.  Moores said one group is headed by movie executive Thomas
Tull, another is led by former Dodgers owner Peter O’Malley and
the third by billionaire hedge-fund manager  Steven Cohen  of SAC
Capital Advisors. Cohen was an unsuccessful bidder for the  Los
Angeles Dodgers , who were sold in March.  Moores told MLB.com he expects at least three more groups
to join the process before the bidding is complete.  “I can’t give you a timetable, but I remain optimistic,”
Moores said in an interview in  New York , where the Padres were
playing the Mets. “There’s no reason for me to believe that we
won’t have a sale in place by the end of the season.”  Moores said in April that the Padres had hired investment
bankers Allen & Co. and Moag & Co. to help sell the team after a
deal with minority owner Jeff Moorad failed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
