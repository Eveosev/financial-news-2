Midwest gasoline strengthened as
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  operated the fluid catalytic cracker at
reduced rates at its Memphis refinery.  The unit has a leak in an overhead line, said Bill Day, a
spokesman for the company in  San Antonio . Workers at  Husky
Energy Inc. (HSE) ’s Lima refinery in Ohio began a strike after
negotiations to reach a contract agreement with the company
failed.  The discount for regular, 87-octane gasoline in Chicago
narrowed 5 cents to 4.5 cents a gallon against futures traded on
the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 12:56 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slipped 0.31 cent to
$2.7784 a gallon.  The Lima refinery can process 160,000 barrels of crude a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “Operations have
not been affected” by the strike, Mel Duvall, a Calgary-based
company spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.  The same fuel in the Midwest, or Group 3, strengthened 1.62
cents to a discount of 8.13 cents a gallon to futures.  Flint Hills Resources LLC’s Corpus Christi refinery in
 Texas  shut a crude unit, according to Genscape Inc., an energy
information provider. A 104,000-barrel-a-day crude section in
the West plant of the refinery was off, Hillary Stevenson,
manager of data integrity at Genscape, said in a telephone
interview yesterday.  The discount for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in the Gulf Coast narrowed 0.5 cent to 3.5 cents a gallon
against futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
