Akbank TAS (AKBNK) ,  Turkey ’s second-biggest
bank by market value, slid to the lowest in almost three years
after  Citigroup Inc. (C)  sold part of its stake at a discount.  Akbank slumped as much as 8.6 percent and traded down 6.2
percent to 5.44 liras at the close in Istanbul, the weakest
since July 2009. Citigroup sold 10.1 percent of its 20 percent
stake at a price of 5.24 liras per share for about $1.15
billion, according to an e-mailed statement today.  “The stock price is likely to converge towards the
transaction price,” said Fatih Tugrul Topac, an analyst at
Istanbul-based brokerage Ata Invest. “At 5.24 liras, the stock
will be trading at 1.02 times estimated price-to-book value,
which we believe offers a good value as the hangover of the
Citigroup disposal will also be removed.”  Akbank shares declined 22 percent through yesterday’s close
after Citigroup announced its intention to sell the shares on
March 23.  Citibank, the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
Akbank’s second-biggest shareholder after Turkish holding
company  Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS. (SAHOL)  The U.S. lender said it
reduced the holding to boost capital. Citigroup will keep its
remaining 9.9 percent in Akbank for three years, Akbank said in
a statement to the exchange after the market closed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
