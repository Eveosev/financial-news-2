second day on forecasts of moderate temperatures that may limit
demand for the fuel from plants that power air conditioners.  June gas in  Alberta  declined 4.6 percent as MDA EarthSat

degrees, compared with a usual 89, according to  AccuWeather Inc. 
in  State College , Pennsylvania.  “While not extreme, this cooler air mass will be the first
in a long while to reach these areas, doing more to limit
cooling demand rather than drive heating demand,” MDA EarthSat
meteorologist Travis Hartman said in a note to clients.  Alberta gas for June delivery dropped 10 cents to C$2.0725
