Lenzing AG (LNZ) , an Austrian maker of
cellulose fibers, said it has devoted 1.5 billion euros ($1.89
billion) toward global investments, with a focus on Asian
countries. A report in Turkish newspaper Vatan on May 17, which
said the company will allocate most the planned investment to
Turkey, is not accurate, and no decision has been made regarding
spending plans for Turkey, a company spokesman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
