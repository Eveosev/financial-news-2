Thailand ’s baht had its biggest
weekly drop in 2012 after foreign funds cut holdings of the
nation’s equities amid concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will slow
global economic growth.  The currency fell for a fourth week as global investors
sold $187 million more local stocks than they bought in the
first four days of the week, exchange data show. The  SET (SET)  Index
of shares has fallen 2.1 percent so far this week and is poised
for a third weekly decline.  “Investors are risk-averse and stock markets and Asian
currencies can still test the weaker side,” said Nalin Chutchotitham, a Bangkok-based analyst at  Kasikornbank Pcl. (KBANK) 
“Importers may be buying the dollar as well because month-end
demand is usually high and also because they are worried that
the dollar may rise further.”  The baht declined 1.1 percent this week, the most since the
five-day period ended Dec. 16, to 31.69 per dollar as of 3:10
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency dropped 0.3 percent today and reached 31.73 earlier,
the weakest level since Jan. 19.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was little changed at 4.52 percent
today and unchanged from a week ago.  Exports unexpectedly fell in April, the fifth decline in
six months. Overseas shipments dropped 3.67 percent from a year
earlier, the Ministry of Commerce said today. The median of 13
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 6.4 percent rise.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bond due June 2017 rose five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.56 percent this
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate declined
two basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
