Dwyane Wade  scored 41 points and the
 Miami Heat  topped the Indiana Pacers 105-93 to advance to the
National Basketball Association’s Eastern Conference finals.  The Heat will play the Boston Celtics or Philadelphia 76ers
in the next best-of-seven series beginning May 28 in Miami.
Philadelphia visits Boston tomorrow in the final game of their
series.  “It was a competitive, hotly contested series and that’s
what it should be remembered for,” said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, whose team was without Udonis Haslem and Dexter Pittman because they were suspended for striking Pacers players
in Game 5. “There were a lot of ups and downs, but the guys
were able to tough it out.”  LeBron James  had 28 points and Wade grabbed 10 rebounds for
the Heat, who trailed 53-51 at halftime at Bankers Life
Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. The Heat outscored the Pacers 28-16
in the third quarter.  “We would have had to play our best to beat them, and we
didn’t play our best,” Pacers coach Frank Vogel told reporters.
“Wade and James going like they were going tonight, they’re
going to be tough to beat by anybody.”  David West  had 24 points and  George Hill  contributed 18 for
the Pacers, who had an 11-point lead with five minutes left in
the first quarter.  The Pacers committed 22 turnovers, which the Heat converted
into 26 points.  “The guys were maybe pressing a little too much,” Vogel
said. “Some (turnovers) just came from being a little too
excited. A lot of these guys are new to this level of play, it’s
just growing pains. But I couldn’t be more proud of my guys.”  The Heat won their only NBA title in 2006, while the Pacers
have never won an NBA championship. Indiana won the last of its
three  American Basketball Association (ABKB)  titles in 1973.  The  San Antonio Spurs  open the Western Conference finals at
home against the Oklahoma City Thunder on May 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
