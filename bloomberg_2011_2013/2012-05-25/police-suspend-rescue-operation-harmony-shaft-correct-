(Corrects headline and first paragraph to say it was
alleged that nine illegal miners died.)  Police suspended a rescue operation
at Harmony Gold Mining Co.’s ARM shaft no. 2 near Welkom in
 South Africa  after a camera didn’t detect any bodies
underground.  Twenty-two people were rescued from the shaft and the
effort has been suspended until further notice, the South
African Police Service in the Free State province said in an e-
mailed statement today. It was alleged that there were nine
miners who had died underground, police said.  The first 10 miners who were rescued appeared in the Welkom
Magistrates Court on charges of trespassing, with their bail-
application hearing postponed to May 31. Another 12 people will
appear on the same charges today, the police said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
