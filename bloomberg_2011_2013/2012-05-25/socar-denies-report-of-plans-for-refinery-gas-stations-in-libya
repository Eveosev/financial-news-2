State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan , or
Socar, denied reports it plans to build an oil refinery and
filling stations in  Libya .  “We are not implementing any project in Libya,” Socar
President Rovnaq Abdullayev told reporters in Baku yesterday.
“No Socar official has been to Libya.”  Agasalim Shukurov, the Azeri ambassador in Tripoli, told
Libya’s Oil and Gas Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza that
Azerbaijan may build a refinery and a chain of gasoline stations
in the North African country, according to a May 14 statement by
the Azeri Foreign Ministry.  Abdullayev said Socar has no plans to operate in Libya
because of political instability in the country.  The company has filling stations in Azerbaijan, Ukraine,
Georgia and  Romania , and is building a refinery in Turkey’s
Izmir region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
