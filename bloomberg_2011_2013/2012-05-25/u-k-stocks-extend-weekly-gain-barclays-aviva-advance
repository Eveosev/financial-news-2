U.K. stocks  closed little changed as
concern Europe’s debt crisis is deepening and speculation
China’s banks may fail to meet loan targets offset an increase
in U.S.  consumer confidence .  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  declined at least
1.9 percent. Xstrata Plc and  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  fell as
mining companies retreated.  Aggreko Plc (AGK)  climbed 2.4 percent
after analysts upgraded the shares.  The FTSE 100 Index added 1.48, or less than 0.1 percent, to
5,351.53 at the close in  London , bringing its gains this week to
1.6 percent. The measure dropped and rose as much as 0.7 percent
today. The FTSE All-Share Index slipped 0.1 percent, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index rallied 1.2 percent.  “The euro-zone economy as a whole is struggling to stay
out of the negative side,” said  Philippe Gijsels , a market
research analyst at BNP Paribas Fortis Capital Markets in
Brussels. “The positives are that central banks will do
whatever they can to stabilize things. But at the moment it is
difficult to see which of the two is going to win out.”  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  has  lost 10 percent from its 2012 high  on
March 16 as Greece failed to form a government that can handle
the nation’s debt payments and borrowing costs for Spain surged.
Artur Mas, president of Spain’s Catalonia region, today
reiterated his call for the Spanish central government to help
regions access funding.  Chinese Banks  China’s biggest banks may fall short of loan targets for
the first time in at least seven years as an economic slowdown
crimps demand for credit, three bank officials with knowledge of
the matter said. A decline in lending in April and May means
it’s likely the banks’ total new loans for 2012 will be about 7
trillion  yuan  ($1.1 trillion), less than an estimated government
goal of 8 trillion yuan to 8.5 trillion yuan, said one of the
officials, declining to be identified because the person isn’t
authorized to speak publicly.  In the U.S.,  consumer confidence  rose in May to the highest
level since October 2007 as prices at the gas pump became less
of a drag on household budgets. The Thomson Reuters/University
of Michigan final index of consumer sentiment climbed to 79.3
from 76.4 the prior month.  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said that most of
 Europe ’s leaders support the issue of joint bonds for the euro
area. Monti told television station La7 yesterday that Italy can
help persuade Germany to support Europe’s “common good.”  Valuation Drops  The FTSE 100’s  valuation  has fallen to 9.6 times its
companies’ estimated earnings, near the cheapest since November,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lloyds, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, fell 4.1 percent
to 25.8 pence. Barclays, the nation’s second-largest bank by
assets, declined 1.9 percent to 181.7 pence.  A gauge of  London-listed mining companies  retreated 1.5
percent today. Xstrata lost 2.4 percent to 912.6 pence, Vedanta
dropped 3.3 percent to 966.5 pence and  Fresnillo Plc (FRES)  slid 2.2
percent to 1,317 pence.  Bumi Plc (BUMI) , an owner of stakes in two Indonesian power-
station coal producers, tumbled 9.7 percent to 360.3 pence, a
record low.  Aggreko climbed 2.4 percent to 2,157 pence. HSBC Holdings
Plc upgraded the world’s largest provider of mobile-power
supplies to overweight, the equivalent of buy, from neutral.  Cape Plc (CIU) , a supplier of fire protection, scaffolding and
cleaners to energy companies, slid 37 percent to 205 pence, the
largest decline since 2002, after saying it will take a charge
for losses on an Algerian project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
