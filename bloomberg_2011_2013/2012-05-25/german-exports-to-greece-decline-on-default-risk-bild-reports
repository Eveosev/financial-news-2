Greece ’s economic crisis is
increasingly threatening exports from Germany to the country,
Bild reported in a preview of an article due to appear today.  The crisis also has prompted Euler Hermes, Germany’s
biggest export insurer, to frequently reject risk coverage, the
newspaper said. The company may this week announce that it is
ending new business with Greece, Bild added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
