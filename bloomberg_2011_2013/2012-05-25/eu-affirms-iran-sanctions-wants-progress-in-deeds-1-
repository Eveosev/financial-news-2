European Union governments will go
ahead with sanctions against  Iran  even though some “progress”
was made in nuclear talks between major world powers and Iranian
officials yesterday, the EU said.  “The sanctions will go ahead on July 1,” EU foreign
affairs spokesman  Michael Mann  told reporters in Brussels today.
“We always keep our sanctions regime under review but they can
only be changed, our sanctions, in response to concrete deeds on
the ground. We don’t alter our sanctions based on words, only on
deeds.”  At talks in Baghdad yesterday, Iran for the first time
agreed to discuss “concrete things” relating to the enrichment
of uranium to 20 percent, Mann said.  “We put concrete proposals on this 20 percent question and
the principle of reciprocity to encourage Iran to do what we
would like,” Mann said. He called it “encouraging” that the
major powers, represented by EU foreign policy chief  Catherine Ashton , will meet again with Iranian officials in Moscow on June
18-19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
