The German government is developing a
six-point plan to stimulate economic growth in the euro-areaâ€™s
crisis-hit states,  Der Spiegel  reported, without citing anyone.  The plan includes setting up special economic zones with
lower tax rates and fewer regulations in peripheral states,
creating agencies to sell state assets, and easing labor market
restrictions, the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
