Shares of the following companies had
 unusual  moves in  Taiwan trading . Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Taipei. The
benchmark Taiex Index dropped 0.8 percent to 7,071.63. The gauge
fell 1.1 percent this week, its third week of declines.  HTC Corp. (2498)  (2498 TT) dropped 4 percent to NT$413. The
smartphone maker’s earnings may decline in the next two years on
lower shipments and margins, Barclays Plc wrote in a note. The
brokerage cut the stock to underweight from equal-weight.  Simplo Technology Co. (6121)  (6121 TT) sank 5.3 percent to
NT$189.50, the biggest drop since Sept. 23.  Dynapack
International Technology Corp. (3211)  (3211 TT) tumbled 6.5 percent to
NT$144, the lowest close since Jan. 30. The battery pack makers
may be hurt the most because shipments of Apple Inc.’s iPad in
May and June may be revised lower on slower-than-expected demand
amid an uncertain macroeconomic outlook, Dennis Chan, an analyst
at Yuanta Securities Co., said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
