Space Exploration Technologies Corp.
docked a supply ship with the International Space Station in a
breakthrough for commercial space travel.  Closely held SpaceX, controlled by billionaire Elon Musk,
connected its unmanned Dragon capsule to the station at 12:02
p.m.  New York  time, according to Kyle Herring, a spokesman for
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Itâ€™s the
first company to accomplish the feat.  NASA  retired its shuttle fleet last year and wants the
private sector to take over the job of ferrying supplies and
eventually astronauts to the station. The U.S. currently relies
on the governments of Europe, Japan and Russia for those trips.  To contact the reporter on this story:
