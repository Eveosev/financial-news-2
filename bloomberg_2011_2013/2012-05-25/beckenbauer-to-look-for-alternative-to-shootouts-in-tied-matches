The head of soccer’s global governing
body is asking former German World Cup winning captain  Franz
Beckenbauer  to find an alternative to penalty shootouts to
decide tied matches.  Chelsea defeated Bayern Munich in last week’s Champions
League final, which finished 1-1 at the end of full time. The
London club won the shootout 4-3. FIFA President  Sepp Blatter 
said matches that finished in a draw shouldn’t be decided by
penalty kicks.  It “can even be a tragedy when you go to penalty kicks,”
Blatter said at FIFA’s Congress in Budapest today. “When it
goes to penalty kicks, football loses its essence.”  Beckenbauer, an honorary president at Bayern, is head of a
FIFA task force looking at future developments of the game.  Zambia won the African Cup of Nations by beating  Ivory
Coast  on penalties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
