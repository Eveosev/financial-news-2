     May 25 (Bloomberg) -- OAO Gazprom climbed for a second day,
adding to its first weekly increase in 11 weeks, after UBS AG
put the stock on its “Key Call” emerging-markets list
following a dividend increase.  Gazprom rose 0.6 percent to 142.97 rubles by close of
trading in Moscow, after adding as much as 1.5 percent earlier,
bringing its weekly increase to 3.2 percent, the most since
February.  The company’s board recommended on May 22 that shareholders
approve a 2011 dividend payment of 8.97 rubles a share, compared
with 3.85 rubles a share for 2010.  “The increase in Gazprom’s dividend payout to 25 percent
is unlikely to be a one-off, in our view, because it was driven
by the government,” UBS analysts led by Maxim Moshkov said in
an e-mailed report. “We estimate the company will have the
highest 2012-13 dividend yield among global oil and gas names of
comparable size and market cap.”  UBS cited “attractive valuations and dividend yield,”
“robust balance sheet,” and “improved control over cash
operating expenditure” as reasons for adding Gazprom to the
“Key Call” list.  To contact the reporter on this story:
