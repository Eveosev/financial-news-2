Hong Kong stocks  fell on concern
China’s biggest banks may fall short of lending targets for the
first time in at least seven years.  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  sank 2.2 percent and
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. dropped 0.9 percent,
leading declines among the largest banks.  Chinese Estates
Holdings Ltd. (127)  tumbled 6.5 percent after saying its billionaire
chairman and chief executive officer Joseph Lau will remain in
his positions through any criminal actions against him in Macau.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slid 0.4 percent to 18,591.19 at 10:50
a.m. local time, heading for a 1.9 percent loss this week. The
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland stocks dropped 1.1
percent to 9,439.52.  “Chinese policy makers are reluctant to cut interest rates
just yet,” said Puru Saxena, who oversees about $350 million as
chief executive officer of Puru Saxena Wealth Management in Hong
Kong. “They are stuck and the economy is suffering.”  If the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, or the H-Share
market as it is known, closes at this level the gauge will have
entered a  bear market , a term typically used to describe a
period when prices have fallen more than 20 percent from a
recent high. The gauge reached this year’s high on Feb. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
