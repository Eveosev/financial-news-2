The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars held at the lowest levels in two weeks, according to
a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 45 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:25 a.m. in
London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure was
minus 41.5 basis points on May 4, the cheapest since July.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 65 basis
points below Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- rose to 33 basis points from 32.5 yesterday. An
increase signals banks are less willing to lend.  The Euribor/OIS spread was at 40 basis points from 39
yesterday. The measure has widened after holding near 38 basis
points, the lowest since Aug. 1, for 14 days.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 761 billion euros ($956
billion) from 766 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
