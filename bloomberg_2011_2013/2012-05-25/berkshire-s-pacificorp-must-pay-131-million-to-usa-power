PacifiCorp, a Portland, Oregon-based
utility and part of  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) ,
said it must pay $131 million to USA Power LLC after a state
court jury in Utah ruled it stole USA Power’s trade secrets.  The jury, in the Third District Court of Salt Lake County,
determined on May 21 that PacifiCorp broke a confidentiality
agreement and misappropriated trade secrets concerning USA
Power’s plans to build a natural gas facility in Juab County,
Utah, according to a regulatory filing today.  The jury awarded USA Power $18 million in contract damages
and unjust enrichment damages of $113 million, PacifiCorp said
in the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  “PacifiCorp strongly disagrees with the verdict and is
aggressively pursuing all options for appeal,” the company said
in the filing.  PacifiCorp serves about 1.7 million customers in Utah,
Oregon, Wyoming,  Washington , Idaho and California, according the
company’s website.  The case involves events that took place from 2002 to 2004,
before Berkshire owned the company, PacifiCorp said in an e-
mailed statement.  The case is USA Power LLC v. PacifiCorp, Third District
Court of Salt Lake City County, Utah (Salt Lake City).  To contact the reporter on this story:
