While a cut in U.K. interest rates,
as proposed by the  International Monetary Fund , “might have a
short-lived announcement effect,” it’s unlikely to make much
difference to the rates banks offer to borrowers, DeAnne Julius
wrote in the Financial Times.  The most effective of the IMF’s proposals is a change in
the type of quantitative easing and liquidity support by the
Bank of England, said Julius, who is a former member of the
central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee.  The IMF’s suggestion that the bank should expand its
purchases to include private-sector bonds, with  default risk 
being borne by the Treasury, is “sensible,” she wrote.  Another big buyer in the private bond market would lower
companies’ borrowing costs and encourage them to issue more
bonds rather than rely so heavily on bank financing, she added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
