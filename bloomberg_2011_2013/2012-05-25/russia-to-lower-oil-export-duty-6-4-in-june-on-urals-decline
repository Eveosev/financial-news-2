Russia , the world’s biggest oil
producer, will reduce its export duty on most crude shipments by
6.4 percent from June 1 after Urals prices dropped.  The standard duty will fall to $419.80 a metric ton, or
$57.27 a barrel, from $448.60 a metric ton this month, according
to an order signed by Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  and
published today on the government website. The discounted rate
on some Eastern Siberian and Caspian Sea oil will drop to
$210.80 a ton compared with $232.40.  Russia bases the export duties on the average Urals crude
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
Urals, Russia’s benchmark export blend, averaged $114.18 a
barrel during the most recent period,  Alexander Sakovich , a
Finance Ministry adviser, said by phone on May 15. In the
previous monitoring period, the crude price averaged $120.76,
according to the ministry.  The government lowered the crude  tax rate  in October,
applying a coefficient of 60 percent, down from 65 percent, and
unifying the duty on most refined products at 66 percent of
that. The duty for middle distillates and heavy products will
fall to $277 a ton next month from $296 a ton in May.  A gasoline tax that Putin imposed in May 2011 to counter
domestic shortages will fall to $377.80 a ton from $403.70 a ton
this month. That is 90 percent of the crude duty. The government
will raise the duty on liquefied petroleum gases such as butane
and propane to $237.10 a ton from $196.60 a ton this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
