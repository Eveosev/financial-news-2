Second Mile, the charity for needy
children founded by former Penn State University assistant
football coach and accused pedophile Jerry Sandusky, said it
will shut down.  The charity asked for court approval to close and transfer
its assets to Arrow Child & Family Ministries, a Houston-based
nonprofit group, interim Chief Executive David Woodle said today
in a statement. Woodle cited a lack of donor support as one
reason for the move.  “The Second Mile has made a positive difference in many
people’s lives and we are very pleased that Arrow will continue
this good work,” Woodle said in the statement.  Sandusky, 68, formed the charity in 1977. He is charged
with more than 50 criminal counts tied to alleged abuse of boys
he met through charity events.  A grand-jury report, released when the charges were
announced in November, said foundation officials became aware of
contact between Sandusky and boys as early as 1998 yet kept the
former coach on staff while assets more than tripled from 2002
through 2009. Sandusky retired from the foundation in 2010.  Jack Raykovitz, who headed the charity for 28 years,
resigned in November along with several board members amid an
uproar over the organization’s response to the allegations
against Sandusky.  Second Mile will remain a legal entity after the transfer
of assets and programs and will continue to cooperate with any
investigations tied to Sandusky, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
