OAO Raspadskaya rose the most in more
than three months after  UBS AG (UBSN)  added the coal producer to its
“most preferred” list of metals and mining stocks, citing
lower valuations.  Raspadskaya jumped 6.4 percent, the biggest gain in the 30-
stock Micex Index, to 69.75 rubles by close in Moscow, the most
since Feb. 13. The stock has lost 30 percent this year and
 trades  at 5.6 times estimated earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
