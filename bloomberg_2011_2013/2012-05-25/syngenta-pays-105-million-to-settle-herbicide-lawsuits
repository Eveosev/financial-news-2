Syngenta AG (SYNN) , the world’s largest
crop-chemicals company, agreed to pay $105 million to settle
litigation involving U.S. water utilities over the herbicide
atrazine.  Syngenta filed the agreement with a district court in
 Illinois  yesterday, the Basel, Switzerland-based company said in
a statement today. The charge is partly covered by provisions,
and the effect on 2012 earnings will be about 50 U.S. cents a
share.  “Under the terms of the agreement, Syngenta expressly
denied liability and the plaintiffs acknowledged that they are
not aware of any new scientific studies relating to atrazine,”
the company said.  Syngenta said it will continue to sell atrazine in the U.S.
for corn growers to control weeds. The chemical was banned in
the European Union in 2003 after the weedkiller was linked in
studies to  birth defects  in frogs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
