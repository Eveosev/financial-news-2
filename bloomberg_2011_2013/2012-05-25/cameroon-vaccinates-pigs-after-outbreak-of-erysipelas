Cameroon launched a pig vaccination
program after an outbreak of erysipelas in the southwest region,
said Agbaw Takang Robert, the regional delegate for livestock,
fisheries and animal industries.  All pig farmers in the region are required to have their
livestock vaccinated, Agbaw Takang told reporters today in Buea,
300 kilometers southwest of the capital, Yaounde.  The government is subsidizing the vaccine, he said.  The disease causes skin lesions and ulcers and can be
fatal, according to The Pig Site website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
