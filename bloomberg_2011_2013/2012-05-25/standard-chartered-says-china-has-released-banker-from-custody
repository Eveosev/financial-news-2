Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K. bank
whose pretax profit from  China  doubled last year, said its
employee Wu Yidian Eden was released from police detention in
the country.  Wu’s conditions of release included bail of 50,000  yuan 
($7,900) and remaining in China for one year, her fiance Jason
David Tan said in an interview. The Wall Street Journal earlier
reported her release.  The private-bank relationship manager, a naturalized
Singapore citizen, had been held since March 6 as part of an
investigation of one of her clients, according to Tan. The
client had allegedly fled with as much as $50 million embezzled
from  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. , Tan said in March.  Standard Chartered spokeswoman Ally Lim, who confirmed Wu’s
release, said the bank isn’t being investigated and that it
couldn’t comment further on Wu’s case as it is part of a
continuing investigation by the police.  Wu was held in Jiangyin, a city in coastal Jiangsu
province, according to Tan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
