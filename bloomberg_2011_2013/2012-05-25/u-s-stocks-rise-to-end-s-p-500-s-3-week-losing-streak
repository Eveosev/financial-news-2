U.S. stocks rose, giving the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index its first weekly rally since April, as
investors were lured by the cheapest valuations since November.  The benchmark index fell on the last day of the week on
concern about Spain’s finances. All  10 industries  in the S&P 500
advanced for the week, as commodity producers and consumer
stocks rose at least 2.9 percent. An index of homebuilders
rallied 8.6 percent amid better-than-expected housing data. The
 Dow Jones Transportation Average (TRAN)  climbed 4.2 percent, the most
since December, as JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised estimates for
airlines.  Dell Inc. (DELL)  lost the most since September 2001.  Facebook
Inc. (FB)  sank 17 percent, trading below its initial offer price.  The S&P 500 climbed 1.7 percent to 1,317.82, extending its
2012 gain to 4.8 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added
85.45 points, or 0.7 percent, to 12,454.83, rebounding from the
lowest level since January.  “It’s just a reflex bounce,” Wayne Wilbanks, chief
investment officer at Wilbanks, Smith & Thomas Asset Management
LLC in Norfolk, Virginia, which oversees about $2 billion, said
in a phone interview. “Global fundamentals have gotten worse,
from the situation in Europe to the slowdown in China. The only
bright spot continues to be in the United States.”  Equities rallied after a three-week, 7.7 percent decline
pushed the  S&P 500 ’s  price-to-earnings  ratio to 13.1 on May 18,
below the average of 16.4 since 1954, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The benchmark gauge is down 5.7 percent in May,
heading for its biggest monthly retreat since September, amid
concern global economic growth is slowing and Greece may leave
the euro area.  China’s Growth  The S&P 500 staged its biggest rally in more than two
months on May 21 after China signaled it would support growth.
The benchmark index swung between gains and losses over the next
four days, as concern over Europe’s debt crisis alternated with
optimism that the region’s leaders would work to keep Greece in
the euro. In the U.S., economic reports sent out mixed signals,
with  consumer confidence  and home sales rising while company
orders for capital equipment declined.  The S&P 500 Materials Index climbed 3.9 percent in the
week, the most since January.  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , the largest U.S.
chemical maker by sales, gained 6.3 percent to $31.30 after
saying an arbitration panel ruled Kuwait must pay $2.16 billion
in damages because it canceled a 2008 agreement to buy a stake
in the company’s plastics business.  An S&P gauge of  homebuilders  surged 8.6 percent, the most
in one month, as demand for new U.S. homes rose more than
forecast, indicating residential real estate may contribute to
economic growth for the first time in seven years.  Toll Brothers, PulteGroup  Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL)  rose 10 percent to $28.20. The largest
U.S. luxury-home builder reported a second-quarter profit that
beat estimates as orders jumped in an improving housing market.  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) , the biggest U.S. builder by revenue,
climbed 9.9 percent to $9.33.  Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the largest U.S.
home-improvement retailer, rose 5.1 percent, the most in the Dow
industrial, to $49.44.  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  jumped 7.5 percent to $8.76.  United
Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  rallied 13 percent to $23.57.  Jamie Baker , an analyst with JPMorgan, raised the earnings estimates
for the airline industry as jet-fuel prices remained near a
five-month low.  Among companies announcing earnings,  Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN) 
rallied 11 percent to $28.42 after the retailer reported first-
quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates on record sales.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  added 4.1 percent to $22.33. The
world’s largest personal-computer maker posted quarterly sales
and profit that topped estimates and said it plans to slice its
workforce by 27,000, buoying optimism for a turnaround.  Dell Tumbles  Dell tumbled 15 percent to $12.46. The third-largest maker
of personal computers forecast fiscal second-quarter revenue
that missed analysts’ estimates. The estimate, paired with a
first-quarter sales and earnings miss, pointed to problems
endemic to Dell, Steve Felice, Dell’s president, said in a
conference call. The sales team focused on individual products
instead of packages of hardware and software, he said.  NetApp Inc. (NTAP)  sank 13 percent to $28.61. The seller of
hardware and software for storing data projected first-quarter
earnings excluding certain items of 39 cents a share at most,
citing increasing uncertainty in the global economic outlook.
Analysts had forecast 59 cents a share, on average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Facebook Slump  Facebook, the social media company that set a record
initial public offering for technology companies by raising more
than $16 billion last week, plunged 17 percent to $31.91. The
shares slipped below the $38 offer price on the second day of
trading on May 21.  Federal securities regulators and the U.S. Senate’s banking
committee have said they will or may review the Facebook
offering. Buyers of the stock have sued Facebook, the sale’s
underwriters and Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., the exchange handling
the listing. Trading of Facebook was delayed on the debut day as
Nasdaq was overwhelmed by order cancellations and trade
confirmations.  Facebook’s IPO has the distinction of producing the worst
return among the 10 largest U.S. deals of the past decade. Its
13 percent decline during the first five days of trading
exceeded the 10 percent drop by MF Global Holdings Inc.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , which makes games played on Facebook, lost 7.7
percent to $6.61 during the week.  Cooper Industries Plc (CBE)  surged 28 percent to $71.28. The
maker of products from LED lighting to industrial circuit
