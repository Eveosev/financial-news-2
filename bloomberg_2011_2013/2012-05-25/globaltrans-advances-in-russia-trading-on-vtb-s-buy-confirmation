Globaltrans Investment Plc (GLTR) , a London-
traded rail-freight operator, rose after VTB Capital confirmed
its buy recommendation, citing the acquisition of the
Metalloinvesttrans railway unit and 2011 earnings.  Globaltrans’ global depositary receipts rose 3.1 percent to
$16.90, the biggest gain since April 30, by the close in London.  VTB analysts led by Elena Sakhnova raised the price-
estimate on the GDRs by 11 percent to $24, citing “the
acquisition of Metalloinvesttrans, slightly better than expected
2011 financials and faster fleet expansion,” according to a
note e-mailed today.  The company acquired the railway unit of Russian
billionaire  Alisher Usmanov ’s iron-ore producer Metalloinvest on
April 27. Globaltrans’ profit increased 40 percent last year as
freight volumes climbed and financing costs declined.  Globaltrans is VTB’s “favourite pick” in the
 transportation industry , according to the note.  The company acquired Metalloinvest’s transportation unit
that operates 9,200 freight cars for $540 million. VTB estimates
the unit’s value at $700 million and sees the deal bringing $160
million to Globaltrans shareholders, according to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
