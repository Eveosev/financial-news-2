Polish bonds advanced after a report
showed retail-sales growth slowed for a third month in April,
reducing the prospect of another interest rate increase.  They yield on notes maturing in January 2014 fell three
basis points to 4.81 percent as of 11:13 a.m. in Warsaw,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Three-month forward
rate agreements, which investors use to bet on changes in
borrowing costs, declined two basis points to 5.12 percent.  Retail  sales  advanced 5.5 percent from a year earlier, the
statistics office said today, falling short of a 9.3 percent
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The central
bank this month raised its main interest rate by a quarter of a
percentage point and didn’t rule out another increase to curb
inflation as it predicted the economy will avoid a steep
slowdown.  “The data has supported the positive sentiment on the  debt
market ,” Bank Zachodni WBK SA economists wrote in an e-mailed
note to clients. “From the monetary policy’s standpoint, it
shows there is no need to raise  interest rates  further.”  The central bank needs more evidence before raising
borrowing costs at its next policy meeting, Monetary Policy
Council member  Jerzy Hausner  said in Warsaw yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
