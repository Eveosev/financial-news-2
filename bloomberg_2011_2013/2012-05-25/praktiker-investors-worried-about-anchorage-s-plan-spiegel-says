Praktiker AG (PRA)  investors including
Semper Constantia Privatbank AG have called for a general
meeting on concern that a loan from Anchorage Capital Group may
be counter to their interests,  Der Spiegel  said, without citing
anyone.  Under the terms of Anchorage’s 85 million-euro ($107
million) loan, the U.S. investor would get the German retailer’s
profitable Max Bahr unit if Praktiker’s restructuring fails, the
magazine reported in the preview of an article to be published
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
