Ship owners representing 80 percent
of the world’s fleet said plans to raise tolls by as much as 15
percent to navigate the Panama Canal as early as July 1 must be
delayed pending a study on the impact on vessel operators.  The International Chamber of Shipping said the Panama Canal
Authority proposals, announced last month, should be withdrawn,
and six months’ notice given for future increases so shipping
companies can plan properly for increased tolls.  “Plans to increase toll charges for the Panama Canal are
rushed, excessive and likely to cause further problems for
shipping companies given the fragile state of economic
recovery,” the London-based ICS said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The U.S. is the biggest user, comprising 65 percent of
trade using the 80-kilometer (50-mile) canal that links the
Pacific and Atlantic oceans. That’s followed by  China  at 24
percent, according to a March presentation from the authority.  Container lines transit the most with 276 vessels on 32
services using the route, the presentation showed. Panama is
spending $5.25 billion to deepen and widen the canal by the end
of 2014, adding new locks to accommodate larger vessels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
