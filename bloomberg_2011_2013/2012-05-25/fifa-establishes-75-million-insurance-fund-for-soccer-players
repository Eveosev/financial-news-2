Soccer’s governing body set up an
insurance policy to pay clubs a maximum annual payout of $9.7
million per player injured while on national team duty.  FIFA has committed $75 million for the policy, which can
pay as much as $91 million. It begins in September and expires
at the end of 2014. FIFA Secretary General  Jerome Valcke  called
the policy “important” in comments at the organization’s
annual meeting in Budapest.  The new provisions follow a dispute between soccer’s
governing body and clubs, who’ve long argued they should be
covered against injuries to players, who are owed millions in
salaries even when they can’t play.  FIFA’s payouts will vary depending on the size of the
injured player’s contract. Clubs will be paid a daily maximum of
$27,000 a player.  The insurance program will start after the European
Championship in Poland and Ukraine. The region’s governing body,
UEFA, is providing insurance for the 16-team event and all
national team matches involving players who earn a living in
 Europe  until Sept. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story: Tariq Panja in Budapest
