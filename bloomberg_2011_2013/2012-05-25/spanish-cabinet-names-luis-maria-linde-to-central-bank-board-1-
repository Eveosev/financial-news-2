Spain  named Luis Maria Linde, a
former director general of the Bank of Spain, to the central
bank’s board, as the government prepares for the end of Governor
Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez’s term in July.  Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria declined
to comment when asked by reporters whether the appointment made
the civil-service economist a candidate for governor, saying
only that the Cabinet’s decision was to name him to the board.  The Bank of Spain’s governor oversees banking supervision
and sits on the  European Central Bank ’s rate-setting council
with the other 16 national central bank heads. Ordonez has faced
criticism since the May 9 nationalization of Bankia, Spain’s
third-largest lender, and Economy Minister Luis de Guindos has
said his successor will have a technical profile and an
international reputation.  Linde, 67, first joined the Bank of Spain in 1983. He was
director general of international affairs and in 2001 led the
country risk division. He was named  executive director  for Spain
at the Interamerican Development Bank in 2005 and was an adviser
to the Bank of Spain’s international affairs department from
2009 to 2011, the government said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
