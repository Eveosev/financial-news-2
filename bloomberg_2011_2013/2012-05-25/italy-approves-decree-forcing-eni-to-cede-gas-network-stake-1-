Italy ’s government approved a decree
today forcing  Eni SpA (ENI)  to cede its entire stake in gas-network
operator  Snam SpA (SRG)  to increase competition and cut prices.  The decree gives Italy’s biggest energy company 18 months
to reduce its stake in Snam, according to an e-mailed statement
from Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s office. Rome-based Eni, which
has a 52 percent stake in Snam, must give up no less than 25.1
percent to state-run lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA and
sell the rest of its shares to investors.  The decision ends years of haggling between Eni and
antitrust authorities on the need to open up Italy’s gas-
pipeline network to greater competition. European Union
regulators have accused Eni of distorting natural-gas flows by
blocking access to pipelines and preventing fuel from reaching
the highest-priced market. Last year, Eni agreed to sell its
stakes in its TENP, Transitgas and TAG pipelines to settle
European Union antitrust charges.  Both Eni and Cassa Depositi’s boards will examine the terms
of the sale on May 30, the two companies said in separate
statements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
