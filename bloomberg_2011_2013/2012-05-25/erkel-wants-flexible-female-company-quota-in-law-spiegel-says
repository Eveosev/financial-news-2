German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
Bavariaâ€™s Prime Minister Horst Seehofer, a conservative ally,
want a law that obliges companies to set flexible quotas for
women in management positions,  Der Spiegel  reported, without
citing anyone.  The law would impose fines on companies that miss their own
targets for promoting women, the magazine reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
