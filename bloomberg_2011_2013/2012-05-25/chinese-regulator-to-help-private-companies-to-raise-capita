The  China  Securities Regulatory
Commission will modify rules to help privately owned companies
to raise capital, part of government efforts to aid smaller
businesses struggling for funds.  The regulator will support sales of bonds and public shares
by private companies, and encourage them to list overseas, the
CSRC said in a  statement  on its website yesterday. The
government will also speed up the establishment of an over-the-
counter market and encourage private investment in securities
and futures brokerages, it said.  China’s efforts last year to cool inflation and rein in
 home prices  with lending curbs and higher  interest rates  reduced
the availability of financing for smaller businesses, prompting
bankruptcies and suicides in the city of Wenzhou. The government
said this week it will let small and medium-sized companies sell
bonds through private placements starting in June.  The nation is encouraging companies to raise more money
through stock and bond sales to reduce their dependency on bank
loans and increase the transparency of their finances.  CSRC Chairman Guo Shuqing has been an advocate of expanding
China’s corporate debt market, saying in a March interview with
the official People’s Daily that the country’s equity and bond
markets “seriously” lag behind the demands of the real
economy.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
