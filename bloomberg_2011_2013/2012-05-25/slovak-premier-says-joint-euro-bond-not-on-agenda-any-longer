Slovak Prime Minister  Robert Fico 
said the introduction of joint bonds by countries that share the
euro as a tool to combat the debt crisis seems to be “no longer
on the agenda.”  Fico’s view follows the outcome of a meeting by European
Union leaders two days ago, he said today in a speech at an
annual meeting of the Slovak Employers’ Association in the
capital Bratislava. He also said it’s unlikely that the 27-
nation EU will introduce a transaction tax.  The 18th summit in more than two years of crisis fighting
was marked by new French President  Francois Hollande ’s challenge
to the German-dominated deficit-cutting orthodoxy that has
failed to stabilize the euro area and led to speculation that
 Greece  might be forced out. The leaders also clashed over joint
debt issuance, which was opposed by  Germany .  Fico, who returned to the premiership in April after 22
months in opposition, also said he is “disappointed” with the
results of the summit, adding the leaders seem to prefer
national interests over finding a joint solution to end the
crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
