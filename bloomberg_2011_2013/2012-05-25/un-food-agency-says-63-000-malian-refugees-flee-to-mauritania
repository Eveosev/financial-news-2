At least 63,000 refugees arrived in
Mauritania after fleeing clashes in neighboring  Mali  between
Touareg rebels and government forces, the United Nations World
Food Programme said.  “More than 300 Malians continue to cross the border every
day towards Mauritania, which hosts the largest number of Malian
refugees among countries affected in the region, including Niger
and  Burkina Faso ,” the Rome-based agency said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The rebel Azawad National Liberation Movement began an
uprising in January to demand autonomous rule for Mali’s
northern region, including the historic trading city of
Timbuktu. The group declared independence in northern Mali on
April 6, taking advantage of political instability sparked by
the ouster of President Amadou Toumani Touré on March 22 by army
officers unhappy with the way the government was handling the
Touareg rebellion.  The refugees are fleeing the conflict amid a food and
nutritional crisis in the Sahel region that has affected
countries including Mauritania, the WFP said.  “The Mauritanian region where the Malian refugees are is
the most affected by the food insecurity,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
