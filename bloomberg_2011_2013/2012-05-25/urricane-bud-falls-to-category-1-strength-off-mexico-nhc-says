Hurricane Bud weakened to a Category
1 storm as it drew within 75 miles of the southwest Mexico
coast, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an advisory
shortly before 2 p.m. Eastern time.  Bud has maximum sustained winds of 80 miles (129
kilometers) an hour and itâ€™s moving north at 7 mph. The system
is expected to weaken further before reaching the coast south of
Puerto Vallarta, the center said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
