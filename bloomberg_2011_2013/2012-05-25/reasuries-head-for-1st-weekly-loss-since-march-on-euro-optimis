Treasuries rose amid concern the
 European debt crisis  will worsen as  Spain ’s regional governments
were reported to be struggling with finances, stoking demand for
government debt.  U.S. 10-year yields  remained lower  after  Standard & Poor’s 
reduced ratings on Spanish banks. Treasuries  were poised  for a
second monthly gain as Spain’s Deputy Prime Minister Soraya
Saenz de Santamaria said the country’s government is analyzing
“with all caution” requests from regional governments to help
them regain access to  capital markets  and Catalan President
Artur Mas repeated his call for government help.  “The report about more government intervention in Spain
caused the market to get firm,” said  Michael Franzese , managing
director and head of Treasury trading at Wunderlich Securities
Inc. in New York. “People are getting nervous about  Europe .”  The U.S. 10-year  yield  fell four basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.74 percent at 2:01 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
due in May 2022 added 11/32, or $3.44 per $1,000 face amount, to
100 3/32.  The yield climbed two basis points this week, the first
increase since the period ended March 16.  Holiday Trade  Treasury trading closed at 2 p.m. New York time and will
remain shut on May 28 in observance of Memorial Day in the U.S.,
according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association in New York.  Treasuries returned 1 percent this month as of yesterday,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch  indexes  show, reflecting demand
for the relative safety of U.S. government securities. They
climbed 1.5 percent in April.  More than $4 trillion was erased from the value of global
equities in the first three weeks of the month as concern
deepened  Greece  will abandon the euro.  “People are worried about headlines that may come out of
Greece,” saidIra Jersey, an interest-rate strategist at Credit
Suisse Group AG in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that
trade directly with the  Federal Reserve . “There’s a flight-to-
quality bid going on.”  Volatility was little changed yesterday at 73.1 basis
points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index,
which measures Treasury price swings based on options. The gauge
is below the one-year average of 87.8 basis points.  Trading Data  Trading volume  rose yesterday to $293 billion through ICAP
Plc, the world’s largest interdealer broker. The figure is above
the 2012 average of $242 billion. Volume reached $439 billion on
March 14, the highest since August.  A $29 billion sale of seven-year U.S. notes yesterday drew
a record-low yield of 1.203 percent in the final of three
auctions this week totaled $99 billion.  The Treasury sold $35 billion of five-year debt May 23 at a
record low yield of 0.748 percent, and the same amount of two-
year securities on May 22 at 0.3 percent.  This week’s note offerings, combined with the May 17
auction of $13 billion in 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities, raised $52.9 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $59.1 billion.  Primary dealer  holdings  of  U.S. government debt  rose to
$108 billion, the highest ever, as of May 16, from a net bet
against the securities of $11.9 billion in September, according
to the Fed.  Asset Holdings  Banks have added Treasuries to meet revised reserve rules
from the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law and  Basel  III
regulations set by the  Bank for International Settlements  in
Basel,  Switzerland .  The Fed is replacing $400 billion of shorter-term debt in
its holdings with longer maturities by the end of June to
support the economy.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
trader expectations for consumer prices during the life of the
debt, was 2.14 percentage points, close to the average of 2.15
percent during the past decade.  Investors demand 2.56 percentage points of  extra yield  to
buy 30-year bonds instead of two-year notes. The spread narrowed
to 2.48 percentage points on May 17, the least in seven months.
Thirty-year bonds are more sensitive to inflation because of
their longer maturity.  The 10-year yield touched a 2012 high of 2.4 percent on
March 20 and a low of 1.69 percent on May 17. It will increase
to 2.42 percent by year-end, according to the average forecast
in a Bloomberg survey of financial companies with the most
recent projections given the heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
