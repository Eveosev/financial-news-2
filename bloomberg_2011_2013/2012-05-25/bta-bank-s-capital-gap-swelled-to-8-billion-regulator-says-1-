BTA Bank (BTAS) , Kazakhstan’s biggest lender
before defaulting on $12 billion of debt in 2009, almost tripled
its capital deficit last month amid plans to restructure its
debt for a second time in as many years.  The lender’s liabilities exceeded assets by 1.19 trillion
tenge ($8 billion) as of May 1, compared with a gap of 435
billion tenge a month earlier, the Kazakh central bank’s
financial oversight committee said in a monthly  report  on its
website. BTA’s liabilities jumped to 2.64 trillion tenge in
April from 1.87 trillion tenge in March, the regulator said.  BTA is negotiating a second debt overhaul after failing to
make an interest payment on its July 2018 dollar bonds in
January. The bank halted all payments on $5.2 billion of its
recovery units, which BTA creditors received as part of a
restructuring accord in 2010 to get 50 percent of anything the
lender can get from impaired assets.  Holders of the notes asked for payment in full and ahead of
schedule earlier this month. The lender received a “notice of
acceleration” regarding its more than $5.2 billion “initial
reference amount of recovery units” from BNY Mellon Corporate
Trustee Services Ltd., BTA said on May 3.  The following table shows the one-month performance of
 Kazakhstan ’s five largest lenders by assets, along with seventh-
ranked Alliance Bank and 13th-ranked Temirbank, and their
position as of May 1. The data from the oversight committee are
in billions of tenge:  To contact the reporter on this story:
