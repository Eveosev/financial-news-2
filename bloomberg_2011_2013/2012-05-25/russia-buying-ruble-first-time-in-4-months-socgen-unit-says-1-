Russia ’s central bank started its
first intervention to support the ruble since January after the
currency depreciated beyond a target level today, according to
OAO  Rosbank (ROSB) , the Russian unit of  Societe Generale SA. (GLE)   The  ruble  depreciated 0.6 percent to 35.6411 against the
dollar-euro basket by the close in Moscow, after earlier
declining to as weak as 35.6801.  The central bank was forced to support the ruble after it
weakened past the 35.65 level, Vladimir Kolychev, Rosbank’s
Moscow-based chief economist, said by e-mail. Bank Rossii is
required to sell $100 million to $150 million a day to slow the
ruble’s decline, he said. The central bank’s press office, which
didn’t immediately reply to an e-mailed request for comment, has
said its policy isn’t to comment on interventions.  The currency of the world’s biggest energy exporter has
come under pressure as the threat of  Greece  leaving the euro and
slowing growth in  China  sent Urals crude to a four-month low.
The ruble has fallen 8.2 percent since April, a sharper drop
than the currencies of China,  Brazil  and  India , and is headed
for the biggest monthly decline since September.  “If stresses on the global markets continue to rise and
oil continues to fall the first intervention level will not be a
major support,” Kolychev said. “It’s all about the global
picture and  Europe  in particular.”  Urals crude , Russia’s main export, traded little changed at
$104.83 per barrel, seven cents above its lowest closing price
this year. The ruble lost 0.9 percent to 32.034 per dollar,
depreciating beyond 32 for the first time since January. It fell
0.3 percent to 40.05 per euro.  Floating Corridor  Bank Rossii manages the ruble within a so-called “floating
corridor” against a basket of dollars and euros to limit swings
that erode exporters’ competitiveness. The Russian currency will
be allowed to trade freely in two years’ time, First Deputy
Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev  said in an April 18 interview.  Russia’s 140 billion rubles ($4.4 billion) of domestic
bonds due August 2016 were little changed, leaving the yield
steady at 8 percent. The yield on the country’s only ruble-
denominated Eurobond gained three basis points to 7.244 percent.  Russian dollar Eurobonds due 2015 fell, increasing the
yield by one basis point to 2.313. Similar-maturity Eurobonds
issued by OAO Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, yielded five
basis points less than yesterday at 3.811 percent, while the
yield on 2015 dollar debt from state gas monopoly OAO Gazprom
declined three basis points to 3.783 percent.  Investors increased bets on the ruble weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the currency at 32.5169 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 31.7289 per
dollar yesterday. The cost of insuring Russian bonds against
default over five years with credit default swaps rose seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 251 basis points,
heading for the highest closing level since Jan. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
