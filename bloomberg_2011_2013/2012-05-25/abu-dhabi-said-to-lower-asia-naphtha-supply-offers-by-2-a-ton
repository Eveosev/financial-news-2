  Abu Dhabi  National Oil Co. lowered
its offers for a year’s supply of naphtha starting July,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks with
Asian buyers.  The company offered to sell splitter-grade naphtha at $26 a
metric ton above Middle East benchmark prices, $2 a ton lower
than its initial offer earlier this week, the people said,
declining to be identified because the discussions are ongoing
and confidential. Pentane-plus grade was offered at $27.50 a ton
and low-sulfur naphtha at $26.50 a ton, they said.  Nobody answered calls to the company’s sales and research
departments in Abu Dhabi.  For its annual contract beginning in April this year,
Adnoc, as the company is known, set the premium for pentane-plus
naphtha at $25 a ton, people involved in those negotiations said
in March. Low-sulfur and splitter-grade naphtha were both set at
$23 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
