Colombia ’s peso rose for a second day
as companies bought the currency before local tax payments due
in June and U.S.  consumer confidence  rose to the highest level
since 2007, supporting higher-yielding assets.  The peso erased an earlier decline, rising 0.5 percent to
1,832.70 per  U.S. dollar  after earlier touching 1,851.25 and
approaching the four-month low of 1,853.95 reached May 23.  “Companies bringing in dollars to pay for taxes is
something that will help the peso amid all the volatility” in
global markets, said Juan Camilo Santana, an analyst at Cia. de
Profesionales de Bolsa SA brokerage in Bogota. Companies are
scheduled to pay taxes between June 8 and June 25.  The yield on the country’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 7.16 percent, according to the central bank. The price
rose 0.226 centavo to 122.476 centavos per peso.  The peso fell earlier today as concern  Spain ’s regional
governments are having trouble with finances fueled speculation
 Europe ’s credit crisis is getting worse. Catalan President Artur
Mas repeated at a briefing with reporters today in  Madrid  his
call for Spain’s central government to aid regions.  The currency fell for a third straight week, declining 0.5
percent, paring its rally this year to 5.8 percent. The currency
is still the second-best performer after the Madagascar ariary
among all counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
U.S. sentiment climbed to 79.3 in the ninth straight increase
from 76.4 in the prior month, according to a report today. The
gauge was projected to hold at the preliminary reading of 77.8,
according to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
