Nigerian Treasury bill yields rose as
bids dropped to the lowest in two months at an auction after the
debt crisis in the euro region prompted some foreign investors
to sell fixed-income securities and exit from the country.  The  Central Bank  of Nigeria sold 126.3 billion naira ($789
million) of treasury bills yesterday, the Abuja-based bank said
today in an e-mailed statement. Debt sold included 30.65 billion
naira of 91-day bills at a yield of 13.50 percent, 31 basis
points higher than the 13.19 percent at an auction on May 10.
Bids totaled 307.3 billion naira, 40 percent lower than at the
previous auction and the least since the March 29 sale.  “The yields increased because of the lack of foreign
interest at the last auction and the sell-off in these
instruments by offshore investors,”  Samir Gadio , an emerging-
markets strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd. in  London , said
in an e-mailed reply to questions.  A “re-emergence of crisis in  Europe ” put pressure on the
naira, central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said May 22 after the
Abuja-based regulator left its benchmark  interest rate  on hold
for a fourth consecutive meeting at a record 12 percent.
Inflation accelerated to 12.9 percent in April after the
government partly removed fuel subsidies and boosted gasoline
costs.  The bank also sold 45 billion naira of 182-day securities
at 14.14 percent, 27 basis points higher than the previous sale
and 50.68 billion naira of 364-day notes at 14.30 percent, up 36
basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
