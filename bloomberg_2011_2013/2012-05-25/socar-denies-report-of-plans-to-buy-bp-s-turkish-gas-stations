State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan denied a
report that it’s in talks with  BP Plc (BP/)  to buy the U.K. energy
producer’s chain of filling stations in  Turkey .  Haberturk newspaper said on May 23 that Socar, as the Azeri
company is known, is nearing an agreement to buy BP’s network of
599 gasoline stations in the country.  “Socar is not preparing to buy petrol stations in
Turkey,” Rovnaq Abdullayev, the company’s president, told
reporters in Baku yesterday. Socar may consider retailing oil
products there after its refinery in the Izmir region starts
production in 2014, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
