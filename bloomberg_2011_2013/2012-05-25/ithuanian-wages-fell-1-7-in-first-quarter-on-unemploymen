Lithuanian wages fell 1.7 percent in
the first quarter from the previous three months as employment
in constructions and farming slowed.  The average monthly gross wage fell to 2,138 litai
($778.7), the  statistics office  in the capital Vilnius said in a
statement on its website today. Wages rose 3.2 percent from the
same period of 2011.  Compensation is shrinking after unemployment jumped to 14.5
percent in the first quarter on fewer seasonal jobs and as the
impact of the fourth-quarter bonuses and one-time payments
evaporates. The Baltic nationâ€™s  economy  grew 3.9 percent in the
first quarter, according to preliminary figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
