Cape Plc (CIU) , a supplier of fire
protection, scaffolding and cleaners to energy companies, had
its biggest slump in London trading after saying it will take a
charge for losses on an Algerian project.  Cape plunged 37 percent to 205 pence, the steepest one-day
decline since the shares were first sold in 1989. Today’s drop
reduced the market value of the Singapore-based company to 248
million pounds ($388 million).  The company said it will book a 14 million-pound charge
related to a contract for the Arzew liquefied natural-gas
contract awarded by a unit of  Saipem SpA (SPM)  in 2010, according to a
statement today.  An audit has “identified additional costs arising within
the Arzew Project, which as a result is currently projected to
produce a significant loss,” Cape said. The project had been
“slower than expected with revenues in 2011 less than one-third
of planned levels.”  Seven of 10 analysts who report their recommendations to
Bloomberg advise investors to buy the stock. James Thompson at
JPMorgan and John Cummins at WH Ireland Ltd. reiterated buy
ratings today, though both lowered their share-price
predictions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
