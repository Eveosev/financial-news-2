Vietnam’s economy  may expand 5.6
percent to 5.8 percent this year, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung
said at a meeting with the World Bank yesterday, according to a
posting on the government website.  In December Dung said that growth for 2012 was targeted at
about 6 percent. The economy grew 4 percent in the first
quarter, and online news service VnEconomy reported on May 14
that the pace of expansion in the second quarter may be about
4.5 percent, citing a government report as saying a full-year
target of 6 percent to 6.5 percent would be difficult to
achieve.  Vietnam ’s central bank pushed up  interest rates  last year
in a bid to slow an inflation rate that reached 23.02 percent in
August, which in turn weakened commercial bank lending. The
country’s  inflation rate  has slowed to 8.34 percent, and the
central bank cut its policy rates in both March and April.  “To bring growth all the way to 6 percent for the full
year after a first half that’s probably going to be 4 percent-
plus is asking a lot,” said Marc Djandji, a Ho Chi Minh City-
based senior vice president at Indochina Capital. “Domestically
we’re going to see some improvements in the third quarter and
we’ve already got very strong  exports , so things are going to be
better going forward than they are now.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
