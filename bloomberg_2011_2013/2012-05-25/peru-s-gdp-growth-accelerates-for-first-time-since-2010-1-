Peru’s economic growth accelerated in
the first three months of the year for the first time in seven
quarters on a surge in construction.  Gross domestic product  rose 6 percent from the same period
a year earlier, the government’s statistics agency said today in
an e-mailed report. Growth picked up from 5.5 percent in the
previous three months after slowing every quarter since a peak
of 10.1 percent in the April-to-June period of 2010.  Domestic demand climbed 6.3 percent as a rebound in
construction spurred a 16 percent jump in fixed asset
investment, the agency said. Construction activity, which rose
3.4 percent last year, jumped 12 percent on stronger private
investment and government infrastructure spending.  Retail activity climbed 7.9 percent while manufacturing
contracted 0.9 percent, amid reduced exports of textiles and
lower output of fish products, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
