The ruble headed for its fourth
consecutive weekly loss against the dollar loss on signs of
slowing growth in  China  and amid concern that  Europe ’s debt
crisis may deepen.  The Russian currency lost 0.4 percent to 31.87 per dollar
as of 1:27 p.m. in Moscow, extending its retreat this week to
1.9 percent. The ruble weakened 0.4 percent to 40.0825 per euro
and declined 0.4 percent to 35.5601 against the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket.  China’s biggest lenders may miss loan targets for the first
time in at least seven years, according to three bank officials
with knowledge of the matter, a sign the country’s economic
growth may decelerate further. Urals crude,  Russia ’s main
export, traded little changed at $104.83 per barrel, seven cents
off its lowest price this year.  “If the euro and the stock market continue to go down we
could see the same in the ruble” next week, Kirill Egorov, head
of foreign exchange at OAO AMB Bank in Moscow, said by e-mail.
“Another problem is the situation with  Greece .”  The euro lost 1.2 percent against the dollar this week,
heading for a third week of declines. The MSCI  Emerging Markets 
Index of equities dropped 0.6 percent.  Investors increased bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 32.3643 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 31.755 per dollar
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
