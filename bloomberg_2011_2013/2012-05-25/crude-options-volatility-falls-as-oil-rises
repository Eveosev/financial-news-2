Crude-oil options volatility fell as
the underlying futures advanced for a second day.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 26.7 percent at 3 p.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, down from 26.9 percent yesterday.  “We held ahead of the weekend, but we’re just slightly
down because we’re kind of in a tight range today,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  Floor trading is closed on May 28, the U.S. Memorial Day
holiday.  Crude oil for July delivery rose 20 cents to settle at
$90.86 a barrel on the Nymex, below $91 for the third straight
day. Prices are down 17 percent since their year-to-date high
settlement of $109.77 on Feb. 24.  Oil rose on reports that U.S.  consumer confidence  gained
and that the  United Nations ’ atomic agency found evidence  Iran 
boosted its output of enriched uranium, which could be used for
a nuclear weapon.  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
were July $100 calls, which were unchanged at 17 cents a barrel
at 3:08 p.m. with 2,407 lots trading. July $80 puts were the
second-most active options with 1,492 lots changing hands as
they fell 7 cents to 19 cents.  Bullish Bets  Calls accounted for 57 percent of electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish bets accounted for 55 percent of the 136,430 trades
in the previous session. July $90 puts were the most actively
traded, with 5,349 lots changing hands. They fell 43 cents to
$2.12 a barrel. The next-most active options, September $110
calls, rose 3 cents to 48 cents on volume of 5,188.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 41,044
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 35,944 lots and
