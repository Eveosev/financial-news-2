Russian stock  futures  slumped and  OAO
Mechel (MTL)  declined for a third day on mounting concern  China ’s
slowing economy may crimp demand for commodities.  Futures expiring in June on Moscow’s dollar-denominated RTS

China for a seventh month in May, while in Europe output fell
this month and German business confidence declined. Russia, the
world’s biggest energy exporter, got almost 50 percent of budget
revenue from oil and gas sales last year. President  Vladimir Putin  cleared the way yesterday for a state entity that controls
oil producer OAO Rosneft and holds shares in  OAO Gazprom (OGZPY)  to
expand its energy assets.  “Market participants in Russia stocks are feeling the
uncertainty around the euro and uncertainty around China’s
investment plans, which drives commodity demand, and
specifically oil,” Chris Osborne, head of Troika Dialog’s U.S.
unit, said by phone from New York yesterday. “This is a brand
new government and it would be unrealistic to presume that they
would have a plan worked out to the last detail. None of these
decisions have been finalized.”  Volatility Rises  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, declined for a third day, losing 0.1
percent to $24.35. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures

reading of 48.7 in May, compared with a final 49.3 for April,
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said yesterday. A number
below 50 shows contraction.  German Confidence  In the euro area, an index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in the services and manufacturing industries retreated
to 45.9 from 46.7 in April, London-based Markit said yesterday.
German business confidence fell more than economists forecast in
May as speculation that  Greece  might leave the euro area clouded
the economic outlook.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI index  of 24 raw materials rose

state-owned Rosneftegaz can acquire more energy assets in
addition to its control of oil producer Rosneft, and its stake
in Gazprom, the world’s biggest natural gas exporter. The
presindent’s spokesman  Dmitry Peskov  told reporters yesterday
that the Putin is committed to privatizing the country’s energy
companies.  “That there is some reluctance by the government to define
what it plans to do is a problem,”  Roland Nash , chief
investment strategist at hedge fund Verno Capital, which manages
more than $200 million in Russia, said in a phone interview from
Moscow. “If oil really begins to fall, then Russia could be in
for some real difficulty, and the commodity companies would be
hit first.”  OAO Surgutneftegas (SGTPY) , Russia’s fourth largest oil producer,
gained 2.2 percent to $4.70 after the Surgut, Russia-based
company’s  shares  in Moscow jumped 4.6 percent to 14.85 rubles,
the equivalent of 47 cents. One ADR equals 10 ordinary shares.  OAO Lukoil (LUKOY) , Russia’s largest non-state oil producer, added
