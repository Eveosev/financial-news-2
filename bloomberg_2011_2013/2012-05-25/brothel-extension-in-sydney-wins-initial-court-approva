Plans to build  Australia ’s largest
brothel won preliminary approval from a Sydney court, a decision
that would overturn the local council’s rejection of the three-
storey bordello near the city center.  The A$12 million ($11.7 million) plan to expand the
Stiletto brothel to 40 working rooms can be approved if customer
numbers are capped, said Commissioner  Susan O’Neill  of the Land
& Environment Court of New South Wales in Sydney. She said she’d
need further submissions from lawyers on proposals to limit
customer traffic before giving final approval.  Final approval would be a victory for  Artazan Property
Group , the Sydney firm overseeing the project, and the state’s
sex industry. Even after being decriminalized in 1995, New South
Wales brothel owners are increasingly turning to courts to
reverse rejections by councils opposed to the industry, said the
 Scarlet Alliance , which represents Australian sex workers.  The proposal, which was rejected in September by City of
Sydney, included 21 waiting rooms and a 24-space basement
parking lot.  The brothel would be Australia’s largest, according to
Basil Donovan, co-author of a March report on the New South
Wales sex industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
