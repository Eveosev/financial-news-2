Corporacion Andina de Fomento, the
Latin American development lender known as CAF, estimates annual
growth of as much as 12 percent in its loan portfolio over the
next five years as governments race to make up for years of
underinvestment in infrastructure.  Projects including roads and railways will account for more
than half of the $11 billion CAF expects to lend this year,
Antonio Sosa, vice president for infrastructure, said in an
interview in  Lima  yesterday.  The share of infrastructure projects in CAF’s $15 billion
loan portfolio will grow as governments boost investment in
transport and energy to keep pace with the region’s economic
growth, he said. The  International Monetary Fund  said April 25
it sees the region growing 3.7 percent this year after rising
4.5 percent last year, led by expansions in Panama and Peru.  “We’re overflowing with requests for financing,” Sosa
said. “Countries have to step up investment. Infrastructure
systems that were already in a poor state are now congested
because of the acceleration in growth.”  CAF, based in Caracas, finances its lending by tapping
international capital markets and takes contributions from
shareholders, which include the governments of  Argentina ,
Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
