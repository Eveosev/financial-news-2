Two-time U.S. Open champion Ernie Els,  Rickie Fowler  and Zach Johnson were among 24 golfers given
spots in this year’s tournament because of their world rankings,
the U.S. Golf Association said.  Thomas Bjorn, Ben Crane and  Ian Poulter  also qualified
through the rankings system, bringing the total of exempt
golfers for the season’s second major championship to 77, the
USGA said on its  website . Players without exemptions must play
qualifying rounds.  The tournament is set to begin June 14 at the Olympic Club
in San Francisco. Lee Janzen won the last Open played there, in
1998.  The exemptions went to players who were among the top 60 in
the  Official World Golf Ranking  as of May 21. Miguel Angel Jimenez was No. 60, gaining a spot.  Els, the world’s 44th-ranked golfer, won the  U.S. Open  in
1994 and 1997. Past champions receive automatic berths in the
tournament for 10 years.  Fowler is ranked 20th, Johnson 27th, Poulter 28th, Bjorn
38th and Crane 51st.  Matteo Manassero, ranked 62nd, is among those who still can
qualify by moving into the top 60 by June 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
