Pacific Metals Co.,  Japan ’s largest
ferro-nickel producer, said it plans to increase output by 21
percent this year after an earthquake and tsunami disrupted
production in 2011.  Output will rise to 34,800 metric tons in the year that
started on April 1 from 28,700 tons a year earlier, Kosuke
Naradate, a company spokesman, said by phone today. The
Hachinohe plant in Aomori prefecture, northern Japan, has an
annual capacity equivalent to 44,000 tons of refined nickel,
according to the company.  Nippon Steel & Sumikin Stainless Steel Corp., 80 percent-
owned by  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) , has a 10 percent stake in Pacific
Metals. Nippon Steel is Japan’s biggest steelmaker. Nickel, used
to strengthen stainless steel, fell 0.8 percent to $16,960 a ton
at 2:15 p.m. Tokyo time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
