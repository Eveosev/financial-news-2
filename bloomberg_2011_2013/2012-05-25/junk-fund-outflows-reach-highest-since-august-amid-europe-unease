Investors pulled $3.05 billion from
junk-bond funds globally in the week ended May 23, the most
since August, as a worsening political crisis in  Greece  roiled
credit markets.  U.S. funds recorded the most outflows, with $1.97 billion
pulled from funds that buy speculative-grade debt, according to
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global. That included $856
million of redemptions from exchange-traded funds that hold the
securities.  High-yield bond funds reported $1.26 billion of redemptions
on May 21, the biggest daily withdrawal this year, amid mounting
concern that a Greek exit from Europe’s shared currency would
disrupt the financial system.  Speculative-grade debt, rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s , has
lost 1.6 percent this month, the biggest monthly decline since
November, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Global
High Yield Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
