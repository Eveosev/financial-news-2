Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev 
told officials in the southern city of Taraz that “heads will
roll” if budget funds allocated for regional development are
embezzled, Interfax reported.  State officials will have to account for outlays on
development programs similarly to the stringent controls applied
at the height of the economic crisis, Nazarbayev was quoted as
saying by the Russian news service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
