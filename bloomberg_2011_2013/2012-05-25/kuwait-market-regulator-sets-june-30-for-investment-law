Kuwait’s  Capital Markets Authority 
said investment funds have until the end of June to comply with
a law regarding ownership of securities.  The CMA “gives notice to all licensed persons of the need
to settle funds investing in securities before June 30,” it
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  The capital markets law, which places restrictions on
investment funds, stipulates that funds may not own more than 10
percent of a publicly traded company, or invest more than 10
percent of the fund in one company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
