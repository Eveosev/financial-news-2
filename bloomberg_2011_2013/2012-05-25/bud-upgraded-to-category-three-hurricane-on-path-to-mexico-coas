Bud strengthened into a major
hurricane in the  Pacific Ocean  and is expected to cause flooding
when it reaches the southwest Mexican coast today, the U.S.
National Hurricane Center said.  The storm’s top winds have increased to 115 miles (185
kilometers) per hour, making it a Category 3 hurricane on the
five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, the center said in an  advisory 
released shortly before 11 p.m. New York time yesterday. It was
a  Category 2 storm earlier , according to an 8 p.m. advisory.  Bud was 170 miles southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, and was
moving north-northeast at 10 mph toward land. It is expected to
move inland along the coast later today, bringing rain and a
 storm surge  producing “significant coastal flooding” to the
east of where it makes landfall, the center said.  A  hurricane warning  was in effect from Manzanillo northwest
to Cabo Corrientes, and a tropical storm warning and hurricane
watch were issued for Punta San Telmo to the east of Manzanillo,
the advisory showed.  Manzanillo’s port is known for container and rail
facilities, as well as being a destination for  cruise ships ,
according to the Manzanillo Sun  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
