The  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said it is reviewing the release time of its major crop and
livestock reports after commodity exchanges expanded their
trading hours.  The  National Agricultural Statistics Service  and the World
Agricultural Outlook Board are seeking public comment on
changing the release times, the USDA said today in a  statement 
on its website. Current release times will remain in effect
while the department conducts its review.  “It is important that USDA continues to ensure the
integrity of its report release process, particularly as global
exchanges move closer to 24-hour trading,”  Joe Glauber , the
USDA’s chief economist, said in a statement. “USDA is reviewing
our procedures and will solicit public input.”  CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest futures exchange,
expanded electronic trading in grain markets on May 20 to 21
hours a day Sunday through Friday, up from 17 hours. A week
earlier,  Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE)  began offering grain
futures for the first time on its electronic exchange 22 hours a
day, to compete with the CME’s Chicago Board of Trade.  Earlier today, CME Group said it will expand the hours of
the open-outcry trading pits in Chicago on days when the USDA
releases major reports. The pits, where traders shout orders and
use hand signals, will open at 7:15 a.m. Chicago time on report
days rather than 9:30 a.m., starting with the USDA’s June 12
report. The department, based in Washington, releases most major
reports at 7:30 a.m. Chicago time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
