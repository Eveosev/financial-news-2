European Council President  Herman Van Rompuy  plans to tell the Group of 20 major and developing
nations that  Greece  should stay in the euro during meeting on
June 18-19, according to a letter released today by the EU.  “We will reaffirm our commitment to safeguard financial
stability in the euro area and its integrity,” Van Rompuy and
European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said in a May 25
letter to the European Union’s 27 members. “We will also make
clear that we want Greece to remain in the euro area while
respecting its commitments.”  The G-20 plans to meet in Los Cabos, Mexico.  Greece is slated to hold elections on June 17, after a May
6 contest failed to produce a coalition that could form a
government. On May 24, EU leaders exhorted Greek voters to elect
a government that will make the budget cuts needed to keep the
financially-ravaged country in the 17-nation euro zone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
