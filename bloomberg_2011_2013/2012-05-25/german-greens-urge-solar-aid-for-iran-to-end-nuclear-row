German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government should help  Iran  expand renewable energy sources to
solve the conflict over the nation’s nuclear program and prevent
a war in the region, the opposition  Green Party  said.  Germany could help Iran with expertise, logistical support
and assistance in building production plants for renewables such
as solar and wind, Hans-Josef Fell and Omid Nouripour, two Green
Party lawmakers, wrote in a  study  sent to German Foreign
Minister Guido Westerwelle on May 21. The offer should be linked
to Iran ending its nuclear activities, they wrote.  “Iran could achieve its plan to expand power generation
quicker and cheaper, without having to build atomic plants,”
Fell, one of the inventors of the EEG subsidy system that made
 Germany  the world’s biggest solar energy market, said on his
website. The solar aid plan is to inject “fresh impulses” into
the negotiations, Fell wrote.  Negotiators from the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, China
and Russia plan to meet their Iranian counterparts June 18 and
June 19 in Moscow. It will mark the third attempt in as many
months to address international concerns that Iran’s atomic
energy program may be a cover for work on weapons, and Iran’s
efforts to overcome sanctions and diplomatic isolation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
