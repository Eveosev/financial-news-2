Palm oil  climbed, paring a fourth
weekly loss, as an 11 percent decline in prices this month
spurred investor demand and as exports from Malaysia, the second
largest producer, increased.  The August-delivery contract climbed as much as 0.6 percent
to 3,087 ringgit ($975) a metric ton and ended the morning
session at 3,080 ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur . The most active
contract has slid 0.5 percent this week, set for the longest
losing streak since the five days ended Aug. 26.  Palm oil  exports  from Malaysia climbed 10.5 percent to 1.15
million tons in the first 25 days of May from a month earlier,
independent surveyor Intertek said today.  “Although the trend is bearish, the fall of close to 600
ringgit has given rise to some good opportunities for bargain
buying,” said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a director at Commtrendz
Risk Management Services Pvt. in Mumbai. “Some support can also
be seen from the rise in exports from Malaysia.”  European manufacturing and services output shrank in May,
while German business confidence dropped even as Britain’s
first-quarter contraction deepened more than estimated.
Inconclusive elections in  Greece  fueled concerns about a euro
breakup as countries from Spain to Italy struggle to narrow
budget gaps.  “The macroeconomic factors in Europe are ruling sentiment
in the market and any delay in a solution for Greece will push
palm oil prices lower,” said Chung Yang Ker, an analyst at
Phillip Futures Pte. in Singapore.  Soybeans for July delivery was little changed at $13.7625 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for the same
month rose 0.2 percent to 49.53 cents a pound. Palm oil and
soybean oil are both used in foods and fuels.  Palm oil for September delivery gained 0.2 percent to 7,938
yuan ($1,251) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean
oil for the same month retreated 0.2 percent to 9,114  yuan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
