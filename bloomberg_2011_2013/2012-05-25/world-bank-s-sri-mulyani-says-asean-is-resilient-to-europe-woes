Economies in the  Association of
Southeast Asian Nations  are “resilient” to  Europe ’s sovereign
debt woes, with governments having room for monetary and fiscal
policy changes, World Bank Managing Director Sri Mulyani Indrawati said.  “For countries, especially Asean countries who are very
resilient to the crisis, they still have the ability to maneuver
from their own policy space, whether this is on a fiscal side or
a monetary side,” Sri Mulyani said in an interview in  Tokyo 
yesterday. “That’s very important.”  Asian policy makers are under renewed pressure to support
growth as the world grapples with the threat of a Greek exit
from the euro. Greece’s political impasse has deepened the
European crisis and sent Asian currencies and  stocks tumbling ,
adding to the uncertain outlook for exports and growth.  Sri Mulyani said developments in Europe will definitely
affect Asia, especially  East Asia , because of the region’s
export-led growth model and deleveraging by European banks.  Growth in developing East Asia, which excludes Japan and
India, will probably ease to 7.6 percent this year from 8.2
percent in 2011, according to a World Bank report released this
week. The region’s economy will likely expand 8 percent in 2013,
the report said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
