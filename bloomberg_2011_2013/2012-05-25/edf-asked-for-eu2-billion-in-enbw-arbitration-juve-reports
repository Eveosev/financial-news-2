that is  EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK) ’s main shareholder,
is seeking 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in damages in an

percent stake in EnBW from EDF for 4.7 billion euros, the legal
magazine said on its  website , citing a filing in the arbitration
proceedings.  Simon Veser, a spokesman for Baden-Wuerttemberg’s finance
ministry, declined to comment. An EDF press officer wasn’t
