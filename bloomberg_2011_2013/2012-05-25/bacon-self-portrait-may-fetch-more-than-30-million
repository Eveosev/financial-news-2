A Francis Bacon self-portrait is
estimated to raise more than 20 million pounds ($31.3 million)
at an auction in  London .  Bacon’s 1964 “Study for Self-Portrait” will be included
in Christie’s International’s June 27 sale of postwar and
contemporary art. The auction house announced the sale in an e-
mail today and wasn’t prepared to divulge the name or
nationality of the seller.  The gold-framed canvas shows Bacon sitting on a bed. The
expressionistic face is set on a cross-legged figure derived
from a John Deakin photograph of his friend  Lucian Freud  that
the artist kept in his London studio. It’s one of 12 floor-
length self-portraits, four of which are now in museums, 
Christie’s said.  Another portrait from the same series sold for 21.6 million
pounds at  Sotheby’s (BID) , London, in June 2007.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
