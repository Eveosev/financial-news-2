Technicolor SA (TCH) ’s unprofitable set-top
box factory in Angers, France, has filed for insolvency with the
Nanterre Commercial Court.  “The president of Thomson Angers has filed for insolvency
and has petitioned the court to open rehabilitation
proceedings,” the Paris-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Technicolor, a French producer of film-making products and
technology, said last month that it was in talks with five
potential buyers for the factory, its last production site in
France. The company declined to name the potential buyers for
the Angers factory, which employs 330 people, as the discussions
were private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
