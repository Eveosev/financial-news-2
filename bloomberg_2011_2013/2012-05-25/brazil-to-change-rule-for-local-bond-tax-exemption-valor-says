The Brazilian government is preparing
changes in legislation that exempts investments in local bonds
for infrastructure projects from paying income tax, Valor
Economico reported, citing Dyogo de Oliveira, deputy executive
secretary of the Finance ministry.       The changes, which may be implemented in two months, aim to
clarify points of the legislation to make these investments more
attractive, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.   The new rules will likely make clearer that the investor
will still have a tax benefit even if the company uses the funds
for purposes other than infrastructure projects, the newspaper
said. The government may also include in the legislation a  tax
exemption  for investments in mortgage-backed securities, known
as CRI, according to Valor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
