Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s initial public
offering, which set a record for technology companies by raising
more than $16 billion, also has the distinction of producing the
worst return among the largest U.S. deals of the past decade.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the first five days of
trading for the 10 largest U.S. IPOs from the past 10 years.
Shares of Menlo Park, California-based Facebook have fallen 13
percent since underwriters sold them for $38 on May 17. The
decline exceeds the 10 percent drop by MF Global Holdings Inc.
in its first five days.  Visa Inc. (V)  did best among the biggest
deals, rising 45 percent.  Facebook and  Morgan Stanley (MS) , its lead underwriter, have
faced criticism for boosting the number of shares sold in the
IPO by 25 percent last week to 421.2 million. They also boosted
the asking price to $34 to $38 from $28 to $35.  “Raising the price and number of shares was clearly a
mistake,” said Michael Shaoul, chairman of Marketfield Asset
Management in  New York , which oversees more than $1.9 billion.  The first day of trading was disrupted by the “poor
design” of  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) ’s software for IPO auctions,
Robert Greifeld, the chief executive officer of the exchange
operator, said on May 20. The malfunction also prevented Nasdaq
OMX from sending messages to brokerages confirming that clients’
orders went through.  To contact the reporters on this story:
