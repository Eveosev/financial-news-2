VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  fell the most on
record in New York trading after a Moscow court said the world’s
sixth-largest wireless operator was banned from paying dividends
for its 2011 earnings.  American depositary receipts of Amsterdam-based VimpelCom
sank 16 percent to settle at $7.31 in New York, the biggest
decline since the company’s offering in April 2010.  The court banned VimpelCom and its Russian unit from paying
dividends for their profits last year, the company said in a
statement today. The ruling comes after the Federal Anti-
monopoly Service claimed Egyptian billionaire  Naguib Sawiris ’
Weather Investments II SARL sold 11.3 percent of VimpelCom’s
voting stock to  Telenor ASA (TEL) , according to the statement.  “It’s not just about the dividend,” Alexander Vengranovich, an analyst at Otkritie Financial Corp. in Moscow
said by phone. “The news points to an escalation of conflict
between shareholders, mounting uncertainty about the company and
that outweighs everything else.”  The  dividend yield  of VimpelCom was 7.75 percent over the
last 12 months, compared with the 1.93 percent average for
companies traded on the Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
