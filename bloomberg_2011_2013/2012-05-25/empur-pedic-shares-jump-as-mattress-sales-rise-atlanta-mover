Tempur-Pedic International Inc. (TPX) 
shares rose 4 percent after a survey by the International Sleep
Products Association reported U.S. sales for mattresses surged
in April.  Lexington, Kentucky based Tempur-Pedic International, which
got  two thirds  of its sales from mattresses in 2011, advanced
$1.87 to $48.97 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York . Rival  Select Comfort
Corp. (SCSS)  of Plymouth,  Minnesota  increased $1.47 to $28.04.  Revenue for mattress producers rose 14.5 percent in April
from a year earlier, association spokeswoman Karin Mahoney said
in an interview. The surveyed companies accounted for 66 percent
of the mattress units shipped, she said.  “The April data confirms that the mattress industry
remains in a strong growth cycle,” Peter Keith, senior research
analyst with Piper Jaffray & Co., said in a report. “This
implies strong results early in the quarter” for the companies.
Keith rates Tempur-Pedic and Select Comfort as “outperform.”  Mark A. Sarvary, chief executive officer of Tempur-Pedic,
said in an April 19 conference call that the manufacturer was
expecting increased demand this year from consumers. “We think
that the industry is certainly back from doldrums that it’s been
in,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
