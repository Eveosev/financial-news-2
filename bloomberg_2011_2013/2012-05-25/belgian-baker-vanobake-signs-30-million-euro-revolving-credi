Vanobake NV, a family-owned Belgian
baker, obtained a 30 million-euro ($38 million) revolving credit
facility from three banks.  The multicurrency loan will be added to an existing 123.5
million-euro facility signed in 2007 that’s due to expire in
December 2014, according to an e-mailed statement from KBC Bank
NV, the agent for the financing. BNP Paribas’s Fortis Bank NV
and ING Bank NV acted as mandated lead arrangers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
