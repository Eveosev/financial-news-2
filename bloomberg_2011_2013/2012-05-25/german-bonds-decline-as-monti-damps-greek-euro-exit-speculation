France ’s bonds rose, driving 10-year
yields to the least on record, as  consumer confidence  climbed
and investors sought higher-yielding alternatives to German
bunds as havens from Europe’s debt crisis.  The French securities had the longest run of gains since
2008 after Le Parisien reported yesterday that the government
may raise the limit on tax-free state savings accounts,
potentially boosting demand from banks holding the deposits.
Spain’s debt slid amid concern the nation’s regional governments
risk losing access to  capital markets . German yields approached
the all-time lows reached yesterday.  “The current German rate is really low and yield seekers
are looking for other opportunities,” said Hajime Nagata, a
bond investor in  Tokyo  at Diam Co., which manages the equivalent
of $124.4 billion. “With the ceiling on the deposits going up,
the assumption is that this money will be used to purchase
French  government bonds .”  The French 10-year yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.52 percent at 4:29 p.m. London time and
reached 2.422 percent, the least since Bloomberg began
collecting the data in 1990. The 3 percent bond due April 2022
rose 0.215, or 2.15 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,253) face amount,
to 104.205.  Yields have fallen  for eight days in a row, the
longest run since November 2008.  France’s  five-year yield  slid two basis points to 1.35
percent after reaching 1.27 percent, setting a record for a
second day. Thirty-year yields added two basis points to 3.21
percent, paring the decline since May 18 to 33 basis points.  Spread to Bunds  The extra yield, or spread, that investors get for buying
10-year French bonds over similar-maturity  German bunds  has
narrowed 15 basis points this month to 114 basis points. It
widened to a euro-era record 204 basis points in November.  Nagata said he would consider buying French 10-year bonds
if the yield increases to 1.50 percentage points over rates on
same-maturity German bunds.  Investors seeking safety within  Europe  amid speculation
that  Greece  may withdraw from the monetary union are looking
beyond  Germany , which sold two-year notes on May 23 at an all-
time low average yield of 0.07 percent. The securities carried a
zero-percent coupon. The country also sold index-linked bonds
due April 2023 with a real yield of minus 0.24 percent.  ‘Relative Safety’  “Dramatic rallies in core-to-semi-core markets have
dominated price action in the past two trading days,”  Padhraic Garvey , head of developed-market debt at ING Groep NV in
Amsterdam, wrote in a note to clients today. “The likes of
France, Austria and  Belgium  are perceived to be offering the
characteristics of relative safety, but with a spread that more
than compensates for the extra risk.”  Benchmark 10-year German  bund yields  were three basis
points from the  record low reached yesterday as Nuremberg-based
 GfK SE (GFK)  said its consumer-sentiment  index  will be 5.7 next month,
versus economist estimates for it to match May’s initial reading
of 5.6, damping demand for the safest European assets.  The yield was at 1.37 percent after falling to 1.351
percent yesterday. They are headed for a drop of five basis
points this week. Yield on 30-year bonds were little changed at
1.97 percent, declining 12 basis points on the week.  A gauge of sentiment in the French economy rose to 90 from
a revised 89 in April, the highest since November 2010,
according to a statement from Insee, the national statistics
office. Economists predicted a reading of 88, according to the
median of 17 estimates gathered by Bloomberg News.  Spain ’s government is analyzing “with all caution”
requests from regional governments to help them regain access to
capital markets, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said.  Spanish 10-year bond yields climbed 15 basis points to 6.31
percent. The  two-year  yield rose as much as 16 basis points to
4.35 percent, the highest since Dec. 13.  German debt has returned 3.4 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. French securities have gained 5.3
percent, while France’s bonds due in 10 years or longer advanced
9.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
