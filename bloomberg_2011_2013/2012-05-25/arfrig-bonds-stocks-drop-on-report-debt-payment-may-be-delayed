Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3) ’s bonds and
stocks fell as Valor Economico reported that the beef producer
was in talks to postpone until 2015 a coupon payment of as much
as 270 million reais ($134 million) to Brazil’s state-owned
development bank due in July.  Yields on bonds due in 2018 jumped 109 basis points, or
1.09 percentage points, to 14.91 percent at 10:47 a.m. Sao Paulo
time. Shares fell 1.2 percent to 8.62 reais.  The Valor Economico report didn’t say where it got the
information. Marfrig declined to comment, while BNDES, as the
development bank is known, said the debt payment terms haven’t
changed, according to the Sao Paulo-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
