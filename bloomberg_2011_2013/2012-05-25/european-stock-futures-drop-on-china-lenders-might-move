European stock-index futures
retreated as China’s biggest banks may fall short of loan
targets for the first time in seven years amid an economic
slowdown. U.S. index futures and Asian stocks slipped.  Mining companies may move as copper headed for a fourth
weekly loss. Banking shares might be active as Moody’s Investors
Service downgraded  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  and  Svenska Handelsbanken AB. (SHBA) 
 Bankia SA (BKIA)  may move after Reuters reported that the lender will
ask for more than 15 billion euros ($18.8 billion) when it
presents its restructuring plan today.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in June fell
0.4 percent to 2,140 at 7:08 a.m. in  London , while FTSE 100
Index futures also lost 0.4 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index
is still heading toward a 1.3 percent advance this week, its
first gain this month, amid speculation China and the euro area
will take steps to bolster economic growth. Standard & Poor’s
500 Index futures expiring in June decreased 0.3 percent, while
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 0.6 percent.  “European markets are facing a modestly weaker open as
they price in  China  growth concerns and uncertainty over
Greece,” Stan Shamu, a market strategist at IG Markets in
Melbourne, wrote in an e-mail. “Reports suggesting that China’s
major banks may miss their annual loan targets for the first
time in seven years amid weak demand have dampened sentiment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
