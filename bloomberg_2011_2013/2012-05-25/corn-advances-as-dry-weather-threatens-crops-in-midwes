Corn futures advanced in Chicago,
curbing a weekly loss, as dry weather that’s reduced soil
moisture in the Midwest is forecast to continue, threatening
yields in the largest U.S. growing region.  In  Iowa , the largest U.S. corn producer, topsoils rated as
short to very short on moisture jumped to 44 percent in the
seven days through May 20 from 9 percent a week earlier, the
National Drought Mitigation Center reported yesterday. Topsoil
moisture in  Illinois , the second-largest grower, was 33 percent
rated short.  “U.S. weather issues over the next four months will bring
concerns about tight corn supply right back to the fore,”  Paul Deane  and Victor Thianpiriya, analysts at  Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , wrote in a report today.  July-delivery corn gained as much as 1.9 percent to $5.895
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade after losing 4.1 percent
yesterday. The contract traded at $5.8625 a bushel at 2:21 p.m.
Paris time, trimming the weekly loss to 7.7 percent.  “Late-day  weather forecasts  continue to call for warm and
dry weather for much of the Midwest over the three-day holiday
weekend,” forecaster Telvent DTN wrote late yesterday. The U.S.
observes the Memorial Day holiday on May 28.  A prolonged drought in the U.S. may cut the harvest in the
world’s largest grower and exporter of the grain, leaving global
supply below estimates from the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
and the International Grains Council.  The London-based council yesterday forecast a “huge” U.S.
harvest, pushing global production to 913 million metric tons in
the year through June 2013. That’s 12.7 million tons more than
it predicted last month. The USDA said May 10 production around
the world will rise to an all-time high of 945.78 million tons.  Wheat for July delivery traded in  Chicago  rose 1.9 percent
to $6.755 a bushel, trimming the weekly loss to 2.8 percent.
Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris added 0.9 percent to 214.75 euros ($269.17) a ton.  Soybeans for July delivery added 0.2 percent to $13.7875 a
bushel in Chicago, taking the weekly loss to 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
