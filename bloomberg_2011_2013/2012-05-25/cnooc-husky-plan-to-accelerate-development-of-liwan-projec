Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore
oil producer, and partner  Husky (HSE)  Energy Inc. plan to accelerate
the development of the Liwan project in the  South China Sea .  The companies are “confident” about the natural gas
project, Cnooc Chairman Wang Yilin said at the venue of the
company’s annual general meeting in Hong Kong today. A meeting
yesterday with billionaire  Li Ka-Shing , the single-largest
shareholder in Husky, was a visit to a key partner with whom a
friendly relationship is in Cnooc’s best interests, Wang said.  Cnooc and Husky, a Canadian oil company, are exploring for
gas in the South China Sea. The area in Liwan, about 300
kilometers (186 miles) southeast of  Hong Kong , may hold China’s
biggest offshore deposit, the government said in 2006.  Wang and Yang were seen meeting with Li at Hong Kong’s
Cheung Kong Center, where Li’s office is located. Li owns a 69.4
percent stake in Husky.  Commercial operations at Liwan will start in the second
half of 2013, Cnooc Vice-Chairman Yang Hua said today, declining
to disclose the output target. It’s too early to say if gas from
the area will be supplied to Hong Kong, Yang said.  Husky holds a 49 percent stake in Liwan, while Cnooc holds
the rest. Husky will operate the deepwater portion of Liwan 3-1,
including drilling and developing links to a shallow-water
platform. Cnooc will operate the shallow-water platform,
pipelines to the shore and an onshore gas-processing plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
