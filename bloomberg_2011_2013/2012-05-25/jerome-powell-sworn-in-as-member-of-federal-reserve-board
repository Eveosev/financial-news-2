Jerome Powell, an attorney and
private equity investor, was sworn in today as a member of the
Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, the central bank said.  President  Barack Obama  announced in December that he would
nominate Powell, a former Treasury undersecretary for President
George H.W. Bush, to the Fed board for a term ending in January
2014. Powell, along with Harvard University Professor Jeremy
Stein, was confirmed by the Senate last week.  Powell was sworn in by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  in
Washington. He will be able to participate in the Federal Open
Market Committee’s next policy meeting on June 19-20.  To contact the reporters on this story:
