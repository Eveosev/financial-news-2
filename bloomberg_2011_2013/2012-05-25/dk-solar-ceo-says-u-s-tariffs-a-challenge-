The chairman and chief executive
officer of Xinyu, China-based  LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the world’s second-
largest maker of wafers, said U.S. tariffs on solar imports will
be “a challenge for us,” Xinhua News Agency reported today.  Peng Xiaofeng said a May 16 preliminary anti-dumping ruling
by the U.S. Commerce Department for tariffs of as much as 250
percent would force China’s solar industry to reorganize.  China today filed a complaint at the World Trade
Organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
