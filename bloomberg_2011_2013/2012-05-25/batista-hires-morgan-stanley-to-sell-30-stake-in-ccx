CCX Carvao da Colombia SA  jumped on
its first trading day after controlling shareholder  Eike Batista 
said he hired Morgan Stanley to sell a 30 percent stake in the
coal producer to an investor.  CCX, which was spun off by power producer  MPX Energia SA (MPXE3) ,
rose 17 percent to 8.51 reais in  Sao Paulo . MPX gained 5.4
percent.  CCX, based in  Rio de Janeiro , will also be listed in Bogota
as soon as possible, Batista said in an event in Sao Paulo.  Batista, 55, is raising money from international investors
to expand his oil, iron-ore, coal, shipping and power-generation
companies. This week General Electric Co. agreed to invest $300
million in his EBX Group Co. holding company after Mubadala
Development Co. bought a $2 billion stake last month and EON AG
and International Business Machines Corp. bought stakes of units
earlier this year.  The coal producer will probably rise above the market’s
average to reach 20 reais this year, Banco Itau BBA SA analysts
Marcos Assumpcao and Andre Pinheiro said in an note to clients
today.  Batista’s main holdings are oil producer  OGX Petroleo e Gas
Participacoes SA , MPX, iron-ore producer  MMX Mineracao (MMXM3)  &
Metalicos SA, shipbuilder  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3)  and transportation
company  LLX Logistica SA. (LLXL3)   To contact the reporters on this story:
