Singapore ’s  industrial production 
unexpectedly fell for the third time in four months in April as
manufacturers cut output of electronics and pharmaceuticals.  Manufacturing dropped 0.3 percent from a year earlier after
a revised 3.1 percent decline in March, the  Economic Development
Board  said today. The median of 17 economists  surveyed  by
Bloomberg News was for a 4.1 percent gain. Output slipped a
seasonally adjusted 3.5 percent from the previous month.  Asian policy makers, many of whom have cut  interest rates 
this year, are under renewed pressure to support growth as the
world grapples with the threat of a Greece exit from the euro.
 China ’s manufacturing may shrink for a seventh month in May, a
private survey showed yesterday, adding to signs of weakening
demand for Asian goods that have emerged across the region as
 Malaysia , Thailand and the Philippines reported export declines.  “The easing of economic momentum in the advanced economies
and China is likely to weigh down on activity in Singapore,
driving subdued growth rates in both non-oil domestic exports
and industrial production in the coming months,” Vincent Conti,
a Singapore-based analyst at Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd., said before the report.  Electronics production decreased 12.5 percent from a year
earlier in April, while pharmaceutical output fell 7.6 percent
after dropping 6.3 percent in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
