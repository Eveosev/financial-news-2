Japan ’s shipments of rolled-aluminum
products expanded 1.4 percent in April, the third straight month
of increase, as demand from automakers surged.  Supplies to domestic and export markets increased to
166,048 metric tons last month from 163,805 tons a year earlier,
the Japan Aluminium Association said today. The pace of increase
slowed from 1.7 percent in March.  “Shipments to the  auto industry  jumped as the government
revived subsidy payments to buyers of fuel-efficient models,
boosting car sales,” Takeki Murayama, secretary general of the
association, said today in  Tokyo .  Sales to carmakers soared 48 percent to 23,519 tons,
offsetting declines in shipments to makers of cans and
electronics devices, according to the association.  Members of the association include  Furukawa-Sky Aluminum
Corp. (5741) ,  Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406)  and Nippon Light Metal Co.  Details of output, shipments and inventories are as
