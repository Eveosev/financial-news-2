Taiwan ’s dollar dropped for a third
week on concern waning demand for the island’s exports from
China and  Europe  will cool economic growth.  Government bonds 
declined.  The local currency fell for a third day ahead of official
data due today that economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict
will show the economy expanded 0.4 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, versus a 0.36 percent estimate released on
April 30. Gross domestic product increased 1.89 percent in the
final three months of 2011. Official reports this month showed
exports and industrial production contracted in April, while
inflation accelerated to 1.44 percent.  “The authorities will have to keep the currency weak to
support exporters until we see signs of improvement in the
second half,” said Jackit Wong, a regional economist in  Hong
Kong  at Natixis Asia Ltd. “Data are pointing to the downside,
while inflation is still among the lowest in the region.”  The  Taiwan dollar  fell 0.1 percent to NT$29.65 against its
U.S. counterpart this week, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
was little changed today. One-month implied volatility for the
currency, a measure of exchange-rate swings that traders use to
price options, dropped 31 basis points to 5.75 percent this week
and rose 15 basis points today.  Overseas investors sold $493 million more of the island’s
stocks than they bought this week through yesterday, taking net
sales this month to $3.3 billion, according to exchange data.  Chinese Manufacturing  Manufacturing in  China , Taiwan’s biggest overseas market,
probably contracted for a seventh month in May, according to a
preliminary report from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
yesterday. The island’s exports fell 6.4 percent in April from a
year earlier, while factory output shrank 2.33 percent.  The statistics bureau cut its 2012 growth forecast on April
30 to 3.38 percent from 3.85 percent and lifted the inflation
target to 1.94 percent from 1.46 percent.  The yield on the 1 percent government bonds due January
2017 increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
0.966 percent from a week ago, according to Gretai Securities
