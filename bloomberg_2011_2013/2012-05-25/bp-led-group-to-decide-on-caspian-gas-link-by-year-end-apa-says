The BP Plc-led group developing the
Shah Deniz gas field in the  Caspian Sea  will decide on an export
pipeline by year-end, the APA news service reported, citing
Rovnaq Abdullayev, the president of  State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan .  The national energy company, also known as Socar, is a
partner in the Shah Deniz development together with BP,  Statoil
ASA (STL) ,  Total SA (FP) , OAO Lukoil, Turkiye Petrolleri AO and Naftiran
Intertrade Co. BP previously said a pipeline would be selected
by the middle of next year.  Several projects are vying to transport gas from Shah Deniz
to the European Union. The partners must choose between Nabucco
West, a revised version of the EU-backed Nabucco venture, BPâ€™s
South-East Europe Pipeline, and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
