Buyers of coffee from Indonesia, the
world’s third-biggest robusta grower, are paying a smaller
premium for their beans as arrivals at ports increase, according
to Volcafe, the coffee unit of ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Indonesian beans for June and July shipment were trading at
a premium of $50 a metric ton to the price on the NYSE Liffe
exchange in  London , the Winterthur, Switzerland-based trader
said in a report e-mailed today. That compares with a premium of
$70 last week, data from the trader show.  Coffee delivered to ports climbed to about 8,000 tons this
week, Volcafe estimated, from 6,000 to 6,500 tons last week.
Rains in some growing regions “could interrupt the flow of
coffee next week,” according to the report.  Differentials are “softening again” also because the the
Indonesian currency weakened, Volcafe said, referring to a
discount or a premium paid to obtain physical coffee in relation
to the price on the futures market.  In  Vietnam , the world’s biggest robusta producer, trading
is slow as local prices climbed to 44,000 dong ($2.11) a
kilogram (2.2 pounds), the highest price this year, according to
the report. While exporters are looking to buy, there aren’t
offers, Volcafe said.  Vietnamese coffee for June and July shipment was at a
discount of $10 a ton, unchanged from last week, data from the
trader show.  Robusta coffee for July delivery was up 0.9 percent at
$2,242 a ton by 3:08 p.m. in London, after reaching $2,249 a
ton, the highest price since Sept. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
