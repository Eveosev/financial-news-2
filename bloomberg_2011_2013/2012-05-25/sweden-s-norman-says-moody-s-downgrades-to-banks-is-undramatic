Moody’s Investors Service’s
downgrades to  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  and  Svenska Handelsbanken AB (SHBA)  debt
were expected and aren’t reason for concern,  Sweden ’s Financial
Markets Minister Peter Norman said today.  “This was expected and known for a long time,” Norman
told national television SVT. “Many expected several and larger
downgrades, so this is actually positive and not dramatic.”  Nordea and Handelsbanken were cut by one level to Aa3 and
 Norway ’s DNB Bank ASA was lowered to A1, Moody’s said in
separate statements. Credit grades of SEB AB and  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) 
were affirmed while Landshypotek AB was cut two steps to Baa2.
All are at stable outlooks, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
