Refinery utilization at China’s
biggest plants rose to the highest level in 16 weeks after some
facilities resumed following maintenance, according to
Oilchem.net.  The run rate increased 4.8 percentage points from two weeks
ago to an average 86.3 percent of capacity as of yesterday, the
Shandong-based  industry website  said in a statement today.
That’s the highest since February 2. The estimate is based on a
survey of 35 plants with a capacity of about 7.3 million barrels
a day, or 71 percent of the nation’s total.  Utilization may fall in June as  China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp. (600028) ’s Jinling refinery and  Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Co. (338) 
will take some units offline for maintenance, Oilchem said.  Refineries in the east of the country operated at 91
percent of capacity as of yesterday, while those in central
regions were at 80 percent, the report showed. Plants in the
south were at 95 percent, those in the northeast at 79 percent,
the northwest at 84 percent, and the north at 85 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
