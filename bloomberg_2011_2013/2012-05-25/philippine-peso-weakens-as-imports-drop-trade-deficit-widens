The Philippine peso fell for a third
week as official data showed imports dropped and the trade
deficit widened.  Inbound shipments  declined 3.3 percent in March from a year
earlier after revised growth of 2.5 percent in February, while
the  trade gap  almost doubled to $1.05 billion, the  National
Statistics Office  reported today. The central bank will moderate
“very sharp swings” in the exchange rate as these tend to
disrupt planning, Assistant Governor Cyd Amador said yesterday.  “We can’t be too optimistic about the pace of recovery in
the region, given the impact of slowing external demand,” said
Radhika Rao, an economist in  Singapore  at Forecast Pte. “The
peso is unlikely to buck the weakening trend in Asian
currencies.”  The peso weakened 1.2 percent this week at 43.755 per
dollar, data from Tullett Prebon Plc showed. It was little
changed from 43.74 yesterday, after dropping to as low as 43.96,
the weakest since Jan. 12. One-month implied volatility, which
measures  exchange-rate  swings used to price options, climbed 25
basis points today to 7.5 percent.  The yield on the 8 percent notes due July 2031 was
unchanged from yesterday at 6.04 percent, according to Tradition
Financial Services. The rate climbed one basis point earlier.  Inflation this month may average from 2.5 percent to 3.4
percent, central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said yesterday.
The annual pace of price increases increased to 3 percent in
April from a 30-month low of 2.6 percent in March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
