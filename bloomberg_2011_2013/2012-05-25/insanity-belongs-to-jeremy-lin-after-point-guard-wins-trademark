Linsanity belongs to Jeremy Lin.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark  Office  has awarded the term
to Lin, the  New York  Knicks’ point guard who in February moved
to take control of the catch phrase that encapsulated his
meteoric rise from undrafted player to starter.  “It’s not only Linsanity, but all Lin-related
trademarks,” Pamela M. Deese, a partner in the law firm Arent
Fox LLP who is working on the player’s behalf, said in a
telephone interview. “Having a clean plate with rights in place
makes it a lot easier to negotiate licenses and endorsements
deals.”  The player’s filing on Feb. 13 came six days after a
California man with no ties to the 23-year-old Harvard-educated
Lin became the first to apply for a Linsanity trademark. A
second filing was made on Feb. 9 and another on Feb. 14.  Lin, the first Chinese- or Taiwanese-American to play in
the  National Basketball Association , drew widespread attention
coming off the bench Feb. 4 to score 25 points in a win over the
 New Jersey Nets . He then joined the starters and led the Knicks
to six consecutive wins, boosting television ratings, ticket
prices and global interest in his game.  Lin had surgery last month to repair a meniscus tear in his
left knee. He missed the Knicks’ opening-round playoff series
with the  Miami Heat , which New York lost 4-1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
