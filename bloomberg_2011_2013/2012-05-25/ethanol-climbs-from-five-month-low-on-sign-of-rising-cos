Ethanol futures climbed from a five-
month low in  Chicago , paring a weekly decline that was the
largest of 2012.  Prices increased as dry, hot weather in the corn-rich U.S.
Midwest threatens crop development, driving corn futures up as
much as 1.9 percent on the Chicago Board of Trade. The grain is
used to make ethanol, with one bushel distilling into at least
2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  “Ethanol followed its feedstock up to regain some of the
week’s losses as we head into the long Memorial Day weekend,”
SCB & Associates in Chicago wrote in a note to clients.  Denatured ethanol for June delivery gained 1.1 cents, or
0.5 percent, to settle at $2.084 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, rebounding from the lowest price since Dec. 15. The
weekly decline was 6 percent. Futures have fallen 5.4 percent
this year.  Corn futures for July delivery rose to $5.895 a bushel in
intraday trading before closing unchanged at $5.785 on the CBOT.
Corn for December delivery rose 1.3 percent to $5.215 a bushel.  In spot market trading, ethanol in  New York  slumped 6
cents, or 2.8 percent, to $2.10 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive slipped 2.5 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.07, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 2.5 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $2.135 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel decreased
2.5 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.325.  To contact the reporter on this story:
