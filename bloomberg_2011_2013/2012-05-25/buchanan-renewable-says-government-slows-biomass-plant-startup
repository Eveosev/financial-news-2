Buchanan Renewable Fuel Ltd. said the
Liberian governmentâ€™s decision to review its 2009 concession is
to blame for delays in starting up a 36 megawatt power plant
powered with woodchips.  The company, which was stopped by the government from
exporting woodchips from Liberia in May, has leased land,
completed an environmental study and secured financing for the
plant, it said in a statement distributed in Monrovia yesterday.  It cannot start the plant until all negotiations with the
government are completed, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
