A Greek opinion poll showed the
Syriza party, which is opposed to implementing Greece’s
international financial rescue, in a dead heat with pro-bailout
party  New Democracy  ahead of general elections to be held on
June 17.   Syriza’s support stood at 27.2 percent and New Democracy at
27 percent, according to the poll of 1,203 people by Metron
Analysis, broadcast on Athens-based Antenna TV today. Both
parties have built on their support since the inconclusive May 6
elections, according to the poll. Socialist Pasok also improved,
getting 14.8 percent of the vote.   Under Greek election rules, the party with the biggest
share of the vote gets a bonus 50 seats. Neither New Democracy
nor Syriza would be able to form a government on their own on
the basis of the figures in the poll given today.   The poll showed eight parties would enter parliament in the
June elections compared to seven on May 6. Independent Greeks
had 7.2 percent, while Democratic Left had 6.2 percent, the poll
showed. Communist Party of  Greece  and  Golden Dawn  received 5.2
percent and 4.9 percent respectively while Recreate Greece and
Drasi would get into parliament for the first time by garnering
3 percent, the poll showed.   Syriza had 25.1 percent a week earlier, while New Democracy
had 23.8 percent, the poll said. The poll was conducted May 23
to May 24. No margin of error was given.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
