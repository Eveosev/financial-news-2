Louisiana sweet crudes rebounded from
four-month lows as the June scheduling period drew to a close.  The premium for Light Louisiana Sweet to benchmark West
Texas Intermediate crude widened $1 to $11 a barrel at 3:23 p.m.
 New York  time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased 75 cents to $12.25.  “People are squaring up positions as we finish up
scheduling for June,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Trading will be July when the market reopens May 29 after
the Memorial Day holiday weekend.  The premiums of both Louisiana grades fell to their lowest
levels since January as oil flowing to the Gulf from Cushing,
Oklahoma, on the reversed Seaway pipeline signaled added
supplies for area refiners.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  and  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  started
the 150,000-barrel-a-day pipeline May 19. It will take about 12
days for the oil to begin arriving in Houston,  Rick Rainey , a
Houston-based spokesman for Enterprise, said May 14.  Mars Blend’s premium widened 40 cents to $9.50. Poseidon’s
premium narrowed $1 to $7. Southern Green’s premium shrunk $1 to
$8. Thunder Horse’s premium narrowed $1 to $9.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
