Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  reminded his followers that he alone is the leader of
governing party after an internal spat that erupted while he was
on state visits in Pakistan and  Kazakhstan .  “The AK Party’s chairman is Recep Tayyip Erdogan,” he
told reporters after arriving in Istanbul from a five-day trip.  Erdogan’s comments followed a public dispute between
Justice and Development Party spokesman Huseyin Celik and
Interior Minister Idris Naim Sahin, who said  Turkey  didn’t need
to apologize after the accidental killing of 34 civilians
wrongly identified as members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party,
or PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey,
the U.S. and the European Union.  AK Party spokesman Celik said the comments weren’t
“humane.”  The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in the southeast
since 1984 in a conflict where more than 40,000 people died.  “We’ve already made our announcement on this matter,”
Erdogan said of the December bombing. “We said there may have
been a mistake there since the very beginning, yet we also said
this is a terror-ridden area.”  Erdogan said the government’s actions since the incident,
which include visits by officials, an offer of compensation and
investigations, speak for themselves and are equal to an
apology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
