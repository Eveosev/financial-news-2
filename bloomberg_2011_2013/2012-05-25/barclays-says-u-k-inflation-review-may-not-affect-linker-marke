A U.K. review into how inflation
measures are calculated may “come to nothing” and doesn’t
justify changing investments in inflation-linked bonds,  Barclays
Capital  said.  “We consider this to be an issue worth monitoring, but do
not at present believe it warrants a shift in investor
positioning,” economists Simon Hayes and  Alan James  in London
wrote in a note today. The  Times newspaper  reported earlier
today that the examination may change retail-price index
calculations enough for the Bank of England to rule this would
have a “material” impact on holders of so-called linkers.  “We are currently a very long way from this endpoint and
we see a high likelihood that the change in aggregation
methodology does not materialize,” the economists wrote. They
added that the review has reached an “empirical impasse” that
is likely to “block any steps to change the way either” RPI or
the consumer-price index is calculated.  A summary of the Consumer Price Advisory Committee’s  April
meeting , published on the Statistics Authority’s website, show
the panel will consider the review at its July 3 meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
