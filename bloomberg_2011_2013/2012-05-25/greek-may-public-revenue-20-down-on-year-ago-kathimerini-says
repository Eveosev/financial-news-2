Greece ’s public revenue dropped 20
percent in the first 20 days of this month compared with the
same period of 2011,  Kathimerini  reported, without saying how it
got the information.  With no improvement in the trend, amid uncertainty over the
country’s inconclusive May 6 elections, revenue for the first
five months of 2012 could fall 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion)
below budget targets, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
