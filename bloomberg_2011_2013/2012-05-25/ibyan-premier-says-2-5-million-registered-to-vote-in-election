Libyan Prime Minister Abdurrahim el- Keib said that more than 2.5 million Libyans have already
registered to vote in elections in June for a national
legislature tasked with writing a new constitution.  “Work is continuing in order to complete the final
preparations so that the elections will be held on time,” el-
Keib said at a conference in  London  today. “It’s important for
us to ensure that security and stability are ensured and to
organize the elections for the national council in an atmosphere
of security, freedom and transparency.”  Libya is seeking to rebuild after last year’s uprising that
overthrew  Muammar Qaddafi  and ended his 42-year rule, a
transition hampered by deteriorating security and a stagnating
economy. The  International Monetary Fund  said in April that
attracting foreign investment will depend on increasing security
as well as addressing structural problems.  El-Keib said that the government is making “excellent
progress” and that reform of the education and health systems
are among its priorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
