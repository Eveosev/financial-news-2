OAO Sberbank and the Moscow
government signed an agreement to set up new carmaking plant at
the Moscow-owned AMO ZIL plant with a 12 billion-ruble ($275
million) investment, Sberbank Chief Executive Officer  German
Gref  and Moscow Mayor  Sergei Sobyanin  said.  Russia’s largest lender will set up a joint venture called
Mosavtozil, in which it will hold 51 percent and will provide a
6 billion-ruble loan to finance the project for five to seven
years, Mosavtozil General Director Igor Kulgan said.  The plant will have the capacity to produce about 150,000
light commercial vehicles of yet-unnamed foreign brands.
Mosavtozil is continuing negotiations with France’s  Renault SA (RNO) 
and Fiat SpA’s Chrysler Group LLC to assembly their cars.  Sberbank plans to sell its stake to a strategic investor in
2017, Kulgan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
