Asia ’s gasoil crack spread narrowed,
heading for a fourth weekly decline, signaling widening losses
for refiners making the distillate fuel.  Fuel-oil  swaps rose.  Middle Distillates  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude fell 98 cents to $15.10 a barrel at 12 p.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
This  crack spread , a measure of processing profit, is poised to
narrow for a fourth week.  Gasoil swaps for June were unchanged after dropping to
$118.70 a barrel, PVM said. Prices are headed for the 10th
weekly decline in 11 weeks. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was
unchanged after climbing to $1.20. This  regrade  is set for the
second weekly gain in three, indicating it has been more
profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur fuel-oil  swaps for June increased $5.25, or 0.8
percent, to $653 a metric ton, according to PVM. Prices are
headed for the first weekly advance in four.  Fuel oil was at a  discount  of 77 cents a barrel to Dubai
crude, PVM data showed. The gap is poised to narrow for the
seventh week in eight, showing reduced losses for refiners
turning crude into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged after rising to
$12.25 a ton, PVM said. This means bunker, or marine fuel, moved
in tandem with power-station fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures was
up $12.74 at $53.99 a ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The difference, also known as the crack spread,
rebounded from the narrowest since Nov. 29.  Naphtha swaps for June were at $853.50 a ton, PVM data
showed. The petrochemical and gasoline feedstock is set to
decrease for a 12th week.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday climbed to $21.40 a
barrel, the highest since April 30, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. A widening  reforming margin  signals it is more
profitable to make motor fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
