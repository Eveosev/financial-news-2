VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  and its Russian unit
are barred by a Moscow court from undertaking some financial
transactions including paying dividends for 2011, Kommersant
reported, citing the court decision.  The ruling was prompted by Russian antitrust watchdog,
which is disputing deals through which Egyptian billionaire
Naguib Sawiris’ Weather Investments II SARL sold 11.3 percent of
VimpelCom’s voting stock to another shareholder,  Telenor ASA (TEL) ,
and granted it an option to obtain another 3.4 percent, the
Moscow-based newspaper reported today.  The Federal Anti-monopoly Service contends that the
agreements violate Russian laws on investments in strategic
enterprises. VimpelCom declined to comment, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
