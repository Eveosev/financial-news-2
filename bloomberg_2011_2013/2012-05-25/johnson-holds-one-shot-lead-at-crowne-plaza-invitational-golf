Zach Johnson , the 2010 champion, goes
into today’s second round at golf’s Crowne Plaza Invitational
with a one-shot lead.  Johnson, the 2007 Masters Tournament champion, had a bogey-
free 6-under 64 at Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth yesterday
to take a one-stroke advantage over fellow Americans Harris
English, Tom Gillis, Kyle Reifers and Jason Dufner.  “I’ve got zero complaints,” Johnson, 36, told reporters.
“I didn’t put myself ever in a position that was worrisome.”  Chris DiMarco, Tommy Gainey,  Sergio Garcia  and Andres Romero are a shot further back at 4 under par.  David Toms , who won the title last year to end a five-year
wait for his 13th victory on the U.S.  PGA Tour , is in danger of
missing the cut for weekend play after a 4-over-par 74 that left
him in a tie for 104th place.  Dufner came into the event having won the Byron Nelson
Championship on May 20, 21 days after securing his breakthrough
victory, after 164 starts on tour, at the Zurich Classic of New
Orleans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
