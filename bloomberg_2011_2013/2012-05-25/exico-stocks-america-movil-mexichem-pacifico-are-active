The following companies had unusual
price changes in Mexico City. Stock symbols are in parentheses,
and prices are as of the close of trading.  The  IPC index  fell 0.2 percent to 37,486.25.  America Movil SAB (AMXL)  , the wireless carrier
controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , slipped 0.4 percent to
16.76 pesos. As part of a quarterly rebalancing, America Movil
is expected to have its weighting cut on the IPC to 25 percent
as of June 1, Banco Santander SA analysts led by Gonzalo Fernandez wrote in an e-mailed research note dated today.  Mexichem SAB (MEXCHEM*)  , Latin Americaâ€™s biggest maker
of plastic pipe, climbed 0.6 percent to 48.61 pesos. Mexichem
named Antonio Carrillo as its chief executive officer, the
company said today in a statement.  Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico SAB  (GAPB MM), the
operator of airports in the Pacific and central regions of
Mexico, fell 2.7 percent to 48.03 pesos after subtracting a
1.5969 peso dividend paid out today. Without the dividend
effect, the shares would be up 0.6 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Separately, Hurricane Bud weakened as it
neared the southeastern coast of  Mexico , where the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said it will probably go ashore overnight
between Puerto Vallarta and Manzanillo, the site of two airports
operated by the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
