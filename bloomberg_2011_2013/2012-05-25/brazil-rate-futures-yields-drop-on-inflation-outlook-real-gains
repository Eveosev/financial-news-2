The real advanced to a level stronger
than 2 per dollar for the first time in a week after the central
bank auctioned currency swaps for a fourth consecutive day to
support the  exchange rate .  Yields on Brazilian interest-rate futures fell after the
biggest one-day increase in almost three years as a columnist
for a Sao Paulo-based daily said inflation is more likely to
slow to the target of policy makers. The central bank sold
14,000 out of the 40,000 currency swap contracts it offered
today, according to a statement.  “The central bank is offering more swaps than the market
is absorbing,” said Darwin Dib, chief economist at CM Capital
Markets Asset Management, in a phone interview from Sao Paulo.
“If investors aren’t buying all the swaps offered in the
auction, it’s because they aren’t very convinced that this level
of the real is sustainable.”  The real appreciated 2.1 percent to 1.9874 per dollar at
the close in  Sao Paulo  and has risen 1.8 percent since May 18.
It touched 2.1062 on May 23, the weakest level since May 2009.  The central bank auctioned 9,000 currency swap contracts
due in July and 5,000 due in August. The sales are a reversal
from last month’s policy of stepped-up dollar purchases aimed at
weakening the currency to help exporters.  “The central bank was very active this week,” said
Eduardo Galasini, head of proprietary trading at Banco Banif, in
a phone interview from Sao Paulo. “The bank is showing that
it’s concerned with the risk that the drop in the real could
have an effect on inflation. The bank wants a weaker currency,
but not so weak that it increases inflation.”  Reversal of Policy  The real tumbled to a level weaker than 2 per dollar on May
14 for the first time since 2009 after the central bank bought
$7.2 billion in the  spot market  last month, the most since $8.4
billion in March 2011. The currency also weakened as policy
makers cut borrowing costs and  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis
diminished the prospects for  Brazil ’s financial assets.  The currency is still the biggest loser against the dollar
in 2012 among its 16 most-traded counterparts tracked by
Bloomberg, having fallen 6.1 percent.  The yield on the Brazilian interest-rate futures contract
due in January 2014 dropped 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage
point, to 8.52 percent, paring its increase this week to 45
basis points. The yield rose 28 basis points yesterday, the most
since June 2009.  Brazil’s inflation is more likely to be near the center of
its target, or 4.5 percent, in 2012 because of lower  oil prices ,
the government’s reduction of the so-called IPI tax on cars and
expected cuts in energy tariffs, Valor Economico columnist
Claudia Safatle wrote.  Inflation Report  Sao Paulo’s FIPE weekly consumer prices rose 0.41 percent
in the four weeks through May 23, according to a report from the
Foundation Economics Research Institute in Sao Paulo today. The
median forecast of 24 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey was
for an increase of 0.44 percent.  Default rates in Brazil returned to levels seen during the
2009 financial crisis as President  Dilma Rousseff  stepped up
measures to boost credit growth and lower borrowing costs.  Policy makers  will cut the 9 percent target lending rate to
8.5 percent at a meeting next week, according to the median
forecast of 19 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. The central
bank said at its April 17-18 meeting that further cuts to the
benchmark rate will be carried out “with parsimony.”  Average default rates in April rose to 5.8 percent,
matching the level seen in February and the highest since
November 2009, the central bank said in a report distributed
today in Brasilia. Outstanding credit rose 1.2 percent last
month to 2.1 trillion reais ($1 trillion).  The average rate banks charged for loans fell to 35.3
percent in April as lenders from  Banco do Brasil  to  Itau
Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4)  announced cheaper credit lines in response
to criticism from Rousseff that they’re not doing enough to
reduce loan rates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
