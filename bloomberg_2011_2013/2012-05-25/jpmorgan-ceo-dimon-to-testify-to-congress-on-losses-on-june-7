The U.S. Senate Banking Committee
said  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon 
was invited to testify on June 7 about the New York-based
lender’s credit derivatives losses.  “I expect Mr. Dimon to come prepared to provide the
committee a better understanding of this massive trading loss,”
Senator Tim Johnson, the committee’s chairman and a South Dakota
Democrat, said in a statement today. Dimon, who runs the largest
bank in the U.S. by assets, indicated previously that he will
accept an invitation.  “Jamie will of course be able to testify next month,”
said  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, without
specifying a date. “We are working with the House and Senate to
determine a timeframe that will work for both chambers in June
and allow us to provide the most thorough testimony.”  Dimon is under pressure to explain how bets on illiquid
 credit derivatives  led to at least $2 billion in  losses  at his
chief investment office, which is supposed to manage excess cash
while minimizing risk. The strategy was “flawed, complex,
poorly reviewed, poorly executed and poorly monitored,”
according to Dimon, 56.  His testimony may influence lawmakers as they haggle over
rules for the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul enacted two years
ago. They’re debating along with regulators whether the new law
would have prohibited the errant trades and if the rules should
be tighter. Dimon has been campaigning for a looser
interpretation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
