Airbus SAS, which aims to boost
production of its A330 to 11 planes a month from 9.5, is
considering a variant of the twin-engine widebody that would
extend the plane’s range or payload.  The Toulouse, France-based planemaker is talking with
 Rolls-Royce Plc (RR/) ,  General Electric Co. (GE)  and Pratt & Whitney about
incremental improvements to engines and is considering other
improvements including measures to reduce drag on the wing and
boost fuel efficiency, Chief Operating Officer  John Leahy  said.  Improving performance of its only widebody plane would help
Airbus extend the life of the airliner and fend off challenges
by  Boeing Co. (BA) , which is weighing plans to extend its new wide-
body 787 series with another version, the 787-10. For airlines,
boosting the maximum takeoff weight to 240 tons from 235 to
allow for more fuel or passengers would allow for higher revenue
from more seats or new destinations.  “We’ve been getting a lot of requests from airlines about
the 240-ton version,” Leahy said yesterday in Toulouse, France,
where Airbus is based. “It looks like an interesting business
proposition, as it gets you 400 miles more range and quite a few
tons more payload.”  The planemaker is studying whether it has sufficient
resources to accommodate the demands. Increasing takeoff weight
would require some redesigning of the plane, especially to the
wing, to help it cope with higher loads. Leahy said he’s aiming
to have a positive answer by the Farnborough Air Show, which
takes place in early July.  New Engines?  AirAsia X, the long-haul arm of Malaysian budget carrier
 AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA) , is one airline interested in such a plane, as it
would allow direct flights from Kuala Lumpur to Paris, Chief
Executive Officer  Tony Fernandes  said in an interview yesterday.  Fernandes said he has been pushing Airbus to considering
putting GE’s GENX engine on the A330 to further improve fuel
efficiency, though Airbus has so far resisted. The GENX is one
of two engines used to power Boeing’s 787.  Airbus has won 1,199 orders so far for the A330, and
delivered 871. The planemaker had originally expected the plane
to be slowly phased out as the competing Boeing 787 and Airbus’s
own A350 came into service. A three-year delay in 787 production
has boosted demand for the A330, with the plane winning 758
orders alone since the 787 first went on offer.  Airbus’s own A350-900, which will seat 300 passengers,
compared with around 250 for the A330, is scheduled to enter
service by mid 2014.  A330 customers include AirAsia X,  Korean Air (003490) , KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines, a unit of  Air France (AF)  KLM Group,  Deutsche
Lufthansa (LHA)  and Iberia, a unit of  IAG International. (IAG)   Airbus is already building 9.5 A330s a month and is
scheduled to boost that to 10 next year. Airbus would like to
bring the figure to 11 by 2014, though has said that hangs on
whether China comes through with a promised order for 35 A330s.
The order has been held hostage to China’s objections to
European Union plans to tax carbon emissions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
