The lira strengthened for a second
day after the Turkish central bank continued to refrain from
lending at its lowest policy rate to slow the currency’s
depreciation.  The lira gained 0.3 percent to 1.8427 per dollar at 5:30
p.m. in Istanbul, paring this week’s decline to 0.4 percent in
the third week of losses.  While the lira weakened 4.6 percent this month against the
dollar, it has fared better than all the other currencies in the
 Europe , Middle East and Africa region after the Israeli shekel
and the Icelandic koruna. Central bank Governor Erdem Basci has
forecast inflation will fall to 6.5 percent by the end of this
year from the current pace of 11.1 percent.  “The lira has been a good trade and the central bank’s
stance is a factor in this,” Bulent Topbas, a  fund manager  at
Strateji Menkul Degerler AS in Istanbul, said in e-mailed
comments.  The central bank refrained from lending at its lowest 5.75
percent policy rate for a fifth day. It lent 6 billion liras
($3.24 billion) in its one-week repurchase auction at 10.8
percent today. The bank varies its policy rates daily between
5.75 percent and 11.5 percent within the so-called interest rate
corridor to support the currency.  The  yield  on two-year benchmark debt gained 1 basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 9.53 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Yields increased two basis points this
week, paring this year’s drop to 148 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
