ArcelorMittal (MT) ’s Kazakh unit said its
furnaces will be back to normal by May 29 after a fire at a
sintering plant last week.  The blaze, which killed a machine operator and a fireman,
was put out on May 15, the Temirtau-based unit said in an e-
mailed statement today.  ArcelorMittal Temirtau cut production of cast iron to as
low as metric 1,800 tons a day compared with an average plan of
9,452 tons a day, the company said after the fire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
