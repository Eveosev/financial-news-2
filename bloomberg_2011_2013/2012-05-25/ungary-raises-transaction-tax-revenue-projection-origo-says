Hungary may collect as much as 220
billion forint ($922 million) from a proposed tax on financial
transactions, more than the previous plan for 130 billion
forint,  Origo  reported.  The estimate rose because an upper tax limit for each cash
transfer has been removed from the latest draft of the law, the
news website said, citing unidentified government officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
