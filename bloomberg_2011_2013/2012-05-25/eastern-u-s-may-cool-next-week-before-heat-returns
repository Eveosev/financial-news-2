The eastern half of the U.S. may cool
next week before heat begins to build again in early June.  Temperatures along the East Coast and in the South are
expected to be seasonal from May 30 to June 3 after a heat wave
this Memorial Day holiday weekend brings readings in the 90s
Fahrenheit (mid-30s Celsius) to much of the region, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  In the Midwest and Great Lakes, including Chicago,
temperatures are expected to be about 3 degrees below normal,
Rogers said from his office in Bethesda, Maryland.  That cooler weather will be replaced by another round of
heat from June 4 to June 8, with temperatures 5 to 8 degrees
above normal across the Midwest and 3 degrees higher than usual
along the East Coast, Rogers said.  Low natural gas prices have meant more utilities are using
the fuel to generate electricity. Futures traded near the lowest
close in three days on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 8:36
a.m. in Singapore on concern that below-normal temperatures next
week will limit demand for air conditioning.  The normal average temperature in  New York  on May 29 is 67
degrees, according to MDA. Itâ€™s 61 in Boston, 69 in  Washington ,
74 in Atlanta, 79 in Houston, 77 in Dallas, 58 in  Seattle  and 67
in Burbank, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
