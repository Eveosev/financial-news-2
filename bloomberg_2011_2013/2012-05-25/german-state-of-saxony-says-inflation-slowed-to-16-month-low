Inflation in the German state of
Saxony slowed in May as  Europe ’s largest economy weakened.  The inflation rate dropped to 1.9 percent from 2 percent in
April, the state’s statistics office in Kamenz said today.
That’s the lowest since January 2011. Economists forecast German
inflation, calculated using a harmonized European Union method,
held at 2.2 percent, the median of nine estimates in a Bloomberg
News  survey  shows. The Federal Statistics Office will release
that report, based on data from six states, on May 29.  European Central Bank Governing Council member  Andres Lipstok  said this week that inflation risks are “coming down,”
while concerns about the economic outlook remain. Speculation
about a Greek exit from the monetary union is curbing confidence
among executives and investors at a time when at least five of
the region’s 17 economies are in recession, leaving companies
with less room to pass on higher costs.  In Saxony, consumer prices fell 0.2 percent from April,
today’s report showed. The cost of household energy rose 5.7
percent from a year ago after increasing an annual 5.2 percent
in April.  Gas prices  advanced 7.4 percent in the year and
heating oil was 10.8 percent more expensive.  The ECB, which will present new inflation forecasts on June
7, expects euro-area annual consumer-price gains to drop below
its 2 percent price-stability threshold early next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
