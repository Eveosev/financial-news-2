The Treasury Department said today
that the growing European crisis poses a threat to the recovery
in the U.S. through financial and trade ties.  “The deeper crisis now facing  Europe  is a significant risk
to the U.S. outlook as our recovery remains vulnerable to events
abroad,” the Treasury said in a semi-annual report to Congress.
“A tightening of financial markets in Europe can adversely
impact the willingness of U.S. banks to lend and invest. Our
trade connections with Europe are broad and deep.”  The Treasury said recent actions by European leaders --
including measures to restrain budgets -- and steps by the
 European Central Bank  “helped reduce financial stress, and lay
the foundations for greater stability.”  “The success of the next phase of the crisis response will
hinge on Europe’s willingness and ability, together with the
ECB, to encourage stability and growth by applying its tools and
processes creatively, flexibly, and aggressively, to support
countries as they implement reforms and strengthen their banking
sectors,” the Treasury said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
