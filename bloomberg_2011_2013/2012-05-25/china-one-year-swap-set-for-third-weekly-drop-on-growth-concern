China ’s one-year interest-rate swap
rate was set for a third weekly decline on speculation expansion
in the world’s second-biggest economy will slow.  The central bank said growth is facing downward pressure
and the  European debt crisis  may deteriorate, according to a
2011 annual report published on its website today. China’s
manufacturing may shrink for a seventh month in May, a
purchasing managers’ index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics showed yesterday.  “The central bank may cut the lending rate this year to
support growth,” said Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at Industrial
Bank Co. in Shanghai. “Since IRS has had such a big slump in
the past three weeks, space for further declines is limited
unless China introduces more easing measures.”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined 22
basis points in the week to 2.50 percent as of 10:28 a.m. in
 Shanghai , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was
unchanged today and has slid 86 basis points in the past three
weeks.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, fell 18 basis points in the week to 2.51
percent, according to a weighted average rate compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center. It rose 28 basis points
today.  The yield on the 3.51 percent government bond due February
2022 fell six basis points to 3.32 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point. It dropped four basis points today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
