Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  fell 0.2 percent to 54,809.94 at the close in Istanbul,
dropping for a third day and ending its worst week this year.  The following shares were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  , Turkey’s second-biggest bank by
market value, slumped to the lowest level in almost three years,
dropping 6.2 percent to 5.44 liras, after Citigroup Inc. said it
sold a 10.1 percent stake in the lender. Citigroup sold the
stake at 5.24 liras per share for about $1.15 billion, according
to an e-mailed statement today.  Denizbank AS (DENIZ)  , the Turkish lender owned by
Belgium’s  Dexia SA (DEXB) , plunged 20 percent to 14.20 liras, the
biggest drop on record, after the parent company said it entered
exclusive negotiations with  OAO Sberbank (SBER)  to sell the unit. The
Moscow-based lender may agree to pay as much as 1.5 times
Denizbank’s book value, valuing the lender at about $4 billion,
said one person close to the deal, who declined to be identified
as the process is private. Denizbank currently trades at 2.1
times book value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
