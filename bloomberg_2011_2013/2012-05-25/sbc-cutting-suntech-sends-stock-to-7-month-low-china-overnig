LDK Solar Co. (LDK)  and Suntech Power
Holdings Co. led declines in Chinese companies trading in  New
York  last week, on prospects the nation’s solar makers won’t
report a profit this year.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. fell for a fourth week, the
longest losing streak in six months. The gauge lost 0.1 percent
to 90.60. LDK, the world’s second-largest maker of wafers, sank
to the lowest price on record while Suntech, the world’s biggest
solar manufacturer, slid to the weakest level in seven months.
 Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMI)  declined to
trade at a 3.3 percent discount to the Hong Kong shares.  Suntech, the world’s biggest solar-panel maker, and  Trina
Solar Ltd. (TSL)  reported last week worse-than-estimated first-quarter
results while LDK posted a net loss for a third consecutive
quarter on April 30. Earnings are falling at a time  Europe  is
cutting solar energy subsidies as the region’s debt crisis
lingers and the U.S. is imposing tariffs on Chinese solar-
product imports.  “No one is expecting solars to make money this year, so
the question is which company will make it through the next year
or two,” Aaron Chew, New York-based analyst at Maxim Group LLC
said on May 25 by phone. “There has to be consolidation.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slipped 0.5 percent to $32.58
on May 25, ending the week with a 1.3 percent loss. The  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of mainland stocks dropped 0.7 percent to a six-
week low of 2,333.55.  Suntech Sinks  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. shares fell 0.2
percent to 1,317.82 on May 25, snapping a four-day gain, as
concern  Spain ’s regional governments are having trouble with
finances tempered optimism with data showing American  consumer
confidence  rose to the highest since 2007. The measure rose 1.7
percent for the week.  Suntech’s American depositary receipts tumbled 7.8 percent
to $1.78, swelling the weekly decline to 11 percent. The
company, based in Wuxi in  China ’s Jiangsu province, reported May
23 a net loss of $133 million for the first three months of
2012, wider than the average forecast for an $83 million loss by
16 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The U.S. imposed tariffs of 31 percent to 250 percent on
Chinese solar-product imports, the Commerce Department announced
on May 17. Suntech was told to pay 31.22 percent.  LDK, Yingli  LDK reported on April 30 a fourth-quarter net loss of
$588.7 million,  more than five times  analysts’ average
prediction of a $109.7 million loss. The company, based in Xinyu
in China’s Jiangxi province, forecast first-quarter sales of
$190 million to $230 million, lower than a $285.7 million
estimate by analysts.  LDK’s ADRs tumbled 14 percent to a record low of $2.24,
boosting the tumble last week to 21 percent, the biggest weekly
decline since September. The company said it is subject to a
preliminary U.S. tariff rate of 31 percent in a statement on May
24.  “Investors have been looking at all of the solar company
earnings this week and seeing that companies are just not
achieving the cost benefits and profits that people had
expected,”  Gordon Johnson , an analyst at Axiom Capital
Management in New York, said by phone on May 25.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) , the sixth-largest silicon-
based solar module producer, will probably report a $32.8
million net loss in the first quarter on May 30, according to
the average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. This
compares with a $56.2 million net income a year ago.  WTO Complaint  China said it lodged a complaint at the  World Trade
Organization  over U.S. anti-subsidy duties. During probes to
determine whether Chinese companies received illegal  government
aid , the U.S. acted “inconsistently with WTO rules and rulings
in many aspects,” China’s mission to the WTO in Geneva said in
an e-mailed statement on May 25. The U.S. “repeated its
wrongful practice” during its recent anti-subsidy investigation
on Chinese solar cells, it said.  The request for consultations is the first step in the case
and means the two governments must now hold talks for at least
60 days in a bid to resolve the dispute. After that, China can
ask WTO judges to investigate the complaint. Rulings are
typically made within six months, after which either side can
appeal.  Yanzhou Coal (YZC)   Yanzhou Coal Mining Co., the nation’s fourth-largest coal
minder, declined 4.5 percent to $16.01 last week in New York,
the fifth weekly loss in a row. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.,
the nation’s largest maker of the lightweight metal also known
as Chalco, fell 0.9 percent to $10.07, the lowest level since
November 2008.  China’s purchasing managers’ index shrank to a preliminary
reading of 48.7 in May, compared with a final 49.3 for April,
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said May 24. The world’s
second-largest economy  expanded  8.1 percent in the first three
months this year, the slowest pace in 11 quarters.  The  yuan  weakened 0.2 percent last week to 6.3439 per
dollar in  Shanghai , a third weekly decline, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trading System.  Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (981) , a circuit-
chip maker based in Shanghai, sank 11 percent last week to
$1.90, the weakest level since April 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
