Kuwait Petroleum Corp. plans to hold
meetings with buyers in London next month to discuss term
contracts for a year’s supply of naphtha starting in August,
according to three people with knowledge of the talks.  The talks will take place from June 4 in London, the people
said, declining to be identified because the information is
confidential.  Nobody answered two telephone calls to the company’s
general line in  Kuwait City  outside normal office hours.  For its annual contract starting in April this year, the
company sold naphtha at a premium of $22 a metric ton to
benchmark  Middle East  prices, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
