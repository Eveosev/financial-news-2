Mexico , the third-largest supplier of
oil to the U.S., paid $1.17 billion last year to lock in prices
for 2012 exports at $85 a barrel, a 44 percent increase compared
to hedging costs paid the previous year.  Mexico’s Central Bank used “the most notable and trusted”
commodities brokerages as counterparts to hedge 211 million
barrels of crude exports this year, according to a  Finance
Ministry  document obtained by Bloomberg News through an access
to information request. In 2010, Mexico paid $812 million to buy
oil hedges for 222 million barrels for 2011.  Mexico’s hedging contracts are included in annual budget
discussions when government officials set an estimate for oil
revenue, which accounts for about a third of the public budget.
Mexico’s crude-hedging program is probably the world’s largest
of its type,  Miguel Messmacher , the Finance Ministry’s chief
economist, said Jan. 31 to reporters in Mexico City.  The Mexican  mix  of oil for export has traded at an average
of $109.89 this year, 29 percent higher than the estimate of
$84.90 a barrel for the annual budget this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mexico’s crude exports fell 10 percent in the first quarter
to 1.23 million barrels a day from 1.37 million barrels a year
earlier, according to statistics from the Energy Ministry. About
77 percent of that went to the U.S.  Canada  and  Saudi Arabia  are the two largest suppliers to
the U.S., according to the  Energy Information Administration .  To contact the reporters on this story:
