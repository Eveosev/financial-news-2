Rostov, in southern  Russia , plans to
increase its sowing area to boost grain crops to a stable output
of 8 million metric tons a year by 2020, the region’s
agriculture ministry said.  To meet the crop target, Rostov will increase the grain
planting area from last year’s 2.9 million hectares (7.2 million
acres) by 6.7 percent during the next eight years, according to
a statement on the ministry’s  website  yesterday.  Rostov region harvested more than 7.7 million tons of grain
last year, or about 8.2 percent of Russia’s total harvest,
according to the state statistics service data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
