Azure Power India Pvt., an Indian
renewable-energy developer, arranged $70.4 million in long-term
financing from the Export Import Bank of the U.S. to expand the
largest project under the country’s  National Solar Mission ,
using panels from  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)   The 5-megawatt plant in Nagaur, in the state of Rajasthan,
went into operation in December and is being expanded to 40
megawatts, New Delhi-based Azure said today in an e-mailed
statement. Construction is underway and the project is expected
to be complete by February.  The bank has approved the loan and it hasn’t closed, Phil Cogan, a spokesman for the Washington-based lender, said in an
interview today. First Solar, based in Tempe,  Arizona , will be
the sole panel supplier for the Nagaur project.  India is seeking to develop 20,000 megawatts of solar
capacity by 2022 under its National Mission. When complete, the
Nagaur plant will be the largest developed at a single site
under the program, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
