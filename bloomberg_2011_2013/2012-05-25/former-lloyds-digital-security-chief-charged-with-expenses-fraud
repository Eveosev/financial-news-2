Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s former
head of digital banking fraud and security was charged with
submitting false invoices totaling 2.46 million pounds ($3.15
million), prosecutors said.  Jessica Harper “dishonestly and with the intention of
making a gain for herself, abused her position as an employee”
between September 2008 and December 2011, Andrew Penhale, deputy
head of the Crown Prosecution Service’s Central Fraud Group,
said in a statement. The CPS said she submitted invoices to
claim payments “to which she was not entitled.”  “We have determined that there is a realistic prospect of
conviction and a prosecution is in the public interest,”
Penhale said.  Harper will appear before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on
May 31. She was charged by the  Metropolitan Police Service  with
“one count of fraud by abuse of position,” the CPS said. Ed
Petter, a Lloyds spokesman, didn’t immediately respond to a
phone call seeking comment.  Harper’s lawyer, John Armstrong at Armstrong Solicitors in
 London , didn’t immediately respond to a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
