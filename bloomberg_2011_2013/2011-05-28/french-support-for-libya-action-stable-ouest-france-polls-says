French support for the coalition
intervention in  Libya  has stabilized as 55 percent of people
queried favored the action from 54 percent a month ago,  Dimanche
Ouest-France  said today, citing a poll conducted by Ifop.  Support has slipped from the campaignâ€™s start, when 66
percent of people polled 10 days after the air operation began
told Ifop they were in support of it, the newspaper said. The
poll of 1,006 people was conducted by Internet between May 24
and 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
