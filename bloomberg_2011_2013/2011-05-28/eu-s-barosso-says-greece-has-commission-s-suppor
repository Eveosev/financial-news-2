European Commission President  Jose
Barroso  said he expects the number of countries using the euro
as a currency to increase rather than decrease, referring to
scenarios that  Greece  would abandon the euro.  “Regarding rumors in recent weeks, I would like to say
categorically that participation in the euro area is expected to
increase further and not decrease,” Barroso wrote in an article
published in Kathimerini newspaper.  Barroso said there was no easy options for Greece and that
the only way to return to viable growth and job creation was to
restore competitiveness and put public finances on a stable
basis. He said the European Commission stood by Greece’s efforts
and would continue to do so.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
