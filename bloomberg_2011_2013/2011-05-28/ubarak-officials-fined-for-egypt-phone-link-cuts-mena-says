Egypt ’s administrative court imposed
fines totaling 540 million Egyptian pounds ($90.7 million) on
former officials including President  Hosni Mubarak  for cutting
Internet and mobile-phone lines during an uprising in January,
state-run Middle East News Agency said, citing court documents.  Mubarak must pay 200 million pounds, former Interior
Minister Habib El-Adli 300 million pounds and former Prime
Minister Ahmed Nazif 40 million pounds to the government to
compensate for economic harm caused by the communications
disruptions, MENA said, citing the Cairo-based court.  Egyptian authorities ordered Internet connections shut down
and mobile-phone services suspended on Jan. 28 following days of
mass demonstrations calling for an end to Mubarak’s three
decade-rule. Mobile-phone voice services, run by local units of
 Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ,  France Telecom SA (FTE)  and Emirates
Telecommunications Corp. were restored a day later, and Internet
services were back in operation on Feb. 2.  Mubarak, who ceded power on Feb. 11 following 18 days of
protests, faces accusations of killing demonstrators and abuse
of public office. Egypt’s economy is still reeling from the
effect of the uprising and may grow 2.6 percent in 12 months
through June 2012 after expanding 3.6 percent this fiscal year,
Finance Minister Samir Radwan said on May 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
