Arsenal had made an 8 million-pound
($13 million) bid for Blackburn defender Chris Samba, the  Daily
Mail  said.  Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  has put a dominant center-
back at the top of his transfer list after the Gunners went a
sixth straight season without a trophy.  Samba, 27, said earlier this month he came close to leaving
Blackburn during the January transfer period.  “Everybody knows that I am an ambitious player,” the Mail
quoted Samba as saying. “I think a move to Arsenal was very
close in January but that is life.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
