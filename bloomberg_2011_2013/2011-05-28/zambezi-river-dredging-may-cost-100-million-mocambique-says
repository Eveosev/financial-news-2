Dredging of the Zambezi River to
enable barge shipments of  Mozambique ’s coal is expected to cost
about $100 million, Diario de Mocambique reported, citing a
 Riversdale Mining Ltd. (RIV)  community-development analyst.  A total of 180 kilometers (112 miles) will be dredged to a
depth of 3 meters (10 feet) to 3.5 meters to provide capacity
for vessels serving coal mines in Moatize in Tete province, the
state-run newspaper said, citing Ivo Lourenco, the analyst at
the Australian company’s Mozambique unit.  Riversdale Mining intends to use river barges to bring coal
to the harbor in Beira as an alternative to using the Sena
railway line, which has reduced capacity, according to the
newspaper, which is based in the port city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
