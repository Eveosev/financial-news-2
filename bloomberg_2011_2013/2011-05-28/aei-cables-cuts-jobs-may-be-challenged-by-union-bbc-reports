AEI Cables, which produces cables for
the defense and civil-engineering industries, is eliminating
more than 120 jobs at a plant near  Newcastle upon Tyne , England,
the British Broadcasting Corp. reported, citing labor leaders.  The  GMB  union said it’s considering legal action because
the manufacturer didn’t consult with it on the job losses, the
BBC reported on its website. AEI Cables employs about 350
people, the U.K. broadcaster said.  Paramount Communications Ltd. (PRMC)  bought AEI Cables in 2007.
