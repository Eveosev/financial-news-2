Antonio Fazio, a former  Bank of Italy 
governor, was sentenced to four years in jail by a Milan court
for his role in the takeover attempt of Banca Antonveneta SpA by
Banca Popolare Italiana Scrl, lawyer Franco Coppi said today in
a telephone interview.  Fazio was also ordered to pay a 1.5 million-euro fine
($2.15 million), Coppi, who represented Fazio, said. Coppi said
he would appeal the decision.  Francesco Frasca, former head of oversight at the central
bank, was absolved by the court, Coppi said. Coppi and lawyer
