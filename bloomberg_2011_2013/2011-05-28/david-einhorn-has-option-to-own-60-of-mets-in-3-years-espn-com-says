David Einhorn , the hedge-fund manager
who will buy a one-third stake in the  New York Mets , has an
option to own 60 percent of the team in three years, ESPN.com 
reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the terms.  Owner Fred Wilpon and his family can block Einhorn from
gaining the majority stake by returning Einhornâ€™s $200 million
investment, though Einhorn would keep his 33 percent ownership,
ESPN said, citing the unidentified person.  The Mets declined to comment to ESPN on the terms. The
article said the agreement has yet to be made final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
