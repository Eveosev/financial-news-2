Noor Islamic Bank, a lender
controlled by Dubai’s government, said it has never had plans to
be merged or taken over, according to Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al
Maktoum, chairman of Noor Investment Group.  “There were never any plans to merge Noor Islamic Bank
with, or have it absorbed by, any other financial
institutions,” Sheikh Ahmed said in an e-mailed statement.
“These were nothing but unfounded market rumors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
