An Argentine federal prosecutor wants
to investigate whether  Siderar SAIC (ERAR) , the Argentine unit of
Ternium SA, hid financial information from the state-run pension
agency known as Anses, newspaper La Nacion said.  Prosecutor Guillermo Marijuan seeks to focus on possible
economic damage to Anses, which has a stake in the steelmaker,
the newspaper said, without saying how it obtained the
information.  In a statement published today in the country’s main
newspapers including La Nacion and Clarin, Siderar said it would
cooperate with any investigation and regrets the “uncertainty
that these actions generate.” The company declined to comment
further in an e-mailed message to Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
