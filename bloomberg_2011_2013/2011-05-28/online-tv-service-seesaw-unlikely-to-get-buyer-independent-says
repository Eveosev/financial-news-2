Arqiva Ltd. is unlikely to find a
buyer for its online television service SeeSaw, which will be
forced to shut by June 30, the Independent reported, citing an
unidentified spokesman.  SeeSaw needs “considerable investment to succeed,” the
newspaper quoted the spokesman as saying.  Arqiva cannot support the service any longer and next month
will be the “end of the road,” SeeSaw said on its website
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
