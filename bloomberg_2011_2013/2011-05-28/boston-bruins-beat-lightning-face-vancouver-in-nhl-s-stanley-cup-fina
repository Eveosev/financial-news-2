The  Boston Bruins  defeated the Tampa
Bay Lightning 1-0 to advance to the  National Hockey League ’s
Stanley Cup Final for the first time in more than two decades.  The Bruins won the Eastern Conference championship four
games to three to reach the best-of-seven Stanley Cup series
against the  Vancouver Canucks , who host the first game June 1.  After two scoreless periods, Nathan Horton scored a goal
with seven minutes, 33 seconds left in the game last night at TD
Garden in Boston. Tim Thomas made 24 saves in his third career
playoff shutout and second this season.  “I think a lot of people thought I was over the hill,”
Thomas, 37, told reporters after the game. “I knew it wasn’t
true. I put in a lot of work over the summer and I’ve had an
unbelievable year.”  Boston  has lost five times in the Stanley Cup Final, most
recently in 1990, since they collected the last of their five
NHL titles in 1972.  Vancouver  beat the San Jose Sharks 3-2 in double overtime
May 24 to win the Western Conference championship by four games
to one. Top-seeded Vancouver is chasing its first Stanley Cup
title, having lost in the final series in 1982 and 1994.  Vancouver hosts the first two games of the series, which
then moves to Boston for the next two. The fifth and seventh
games, if necessary will be in Vancouver, while the sixth
contest is in Boston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
