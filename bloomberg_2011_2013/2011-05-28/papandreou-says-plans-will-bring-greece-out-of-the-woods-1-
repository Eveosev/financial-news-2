Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said the country’s fiscal plan will lead the country
“out of the woods.”  Papandreou, speaking at a joint press conference in Athens
with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said the country
already has accomplished “impressive” targets and there are
signs of improvement in the Greek economy.  “My determination is to continue with this program in a
very determined and decisive way,” Papandreou said. Greece will
soon recover from its problems by following through with plans
for fiscal adjustment, state asset sales and development of
government-owned real estate.  Harper, who traveled to Greece following this week’s summit
of Group of Eight leaders in France, said he’s confident  Europe 
and Greece will manage the debt crisis.  “We have every confidence that these issues will be
addressed for the benefit for not just the European economy but
for the world economy as whole,” Harper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
