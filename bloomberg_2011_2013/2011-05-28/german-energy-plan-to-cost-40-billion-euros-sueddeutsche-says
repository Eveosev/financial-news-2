Germany ’s new  energy policy  is
expected to cost 40 billion euros ($57 billion),  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  reported, citing calculations by the government’s
Christian Democratic bloc.  Scrapping a tax on nuclear power plants may cost as much as
9.2 billion euros until 2015, a planned program for building
renovations would cost 8 billion euros and a tax subsidy for
energy-efficient buildings would also cost 8 billion euros, the
newspaper said.  The government’s total financing gap until 2015 stands at
100 billion euros and includes expenses for the energy policy,
costs for a reform of the German army and the euro rescue
package, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
