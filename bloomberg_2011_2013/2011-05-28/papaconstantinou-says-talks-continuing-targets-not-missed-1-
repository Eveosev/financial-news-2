Greek Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said talks with European Union and
 International Monetary Fund  officials in  Athens  were still under
way, denying reports the team had said  Greece  has missed its
targets.  “The talks are continuing and will wind up in the next few
days,” Papaconstantinou said in a phone interview with Greece’s
Mega TV channel. “I have every reason to believe they will end
positively for our country and that we will receive the fifth
tranche.”  Papaconstantinou spoke to Mega after the TV channel
reported unnamed IMF sources as saying the country had missed
targets in a review under way under the 110 billion-euro
($157 billion) EU-led bailout. Greece is subject to quarterly
reviews by a team of officials from the EU, IMF and European
Central Bank before each payment of loans under the bailout.  The minister said Mega’s report and another cited by Mega
in German magazine  Der Spiegel  were inaccurate as the inspection
hadn’t finished and no report had been written.  “The phrase ‘Greece has failed to meet all its fiscal
targets’ is completely baseless, and I believe that reports such
as those in Speigel have no relation to the truth for one simple
reason: There is no report yet,” he said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
