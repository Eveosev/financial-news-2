Greece ’s return to the capital
markets in March 2012 is a “very ambitious target,” European
Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  told
 Spiegel  in an interview.  An exit of Greece from the European Monetary Union is “not
a serious option” and a restructuring of the country’s debt
isn’t on the European Commission’s agenda because it would have
negative consequences for the Greek financial system and could
initiate a chain reaction affecting the rest of Europe, the
magazine cited Rehn as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
