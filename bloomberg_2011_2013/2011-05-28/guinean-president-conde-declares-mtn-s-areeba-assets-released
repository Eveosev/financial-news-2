Guinea  decided to lift the seizure of
staff and assets of  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ’s Areeba unit, President
Alpha Conde said in a statement broadcast on state-owned Radio
Television Guineenne yesterday.  The release of the assets follows an agreement earlier in
May by Johannesburg-based MTN, Africa’s biggest mobile-phone
company, to pay the west African government a 15 million-euro
($21.5 million) settlement in a dispute over fees.
Telecommunications Minister Oye Guilavogui said in a broadcast
on May 26 that the payment was received.  To contact the reporter on this story:
