German bunds advanced, extending the
longest streak of weekly gains in more than a decade, as concern
that the euro area’s debt crisis is worsening boosted demand for
the perceived safety of the securities.  The gains pushed 10-year yields down to a more than four-
month low while yields on two-year notes sank to the lowest
since March 18. Luxembourg’s Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker 
said this week that  Greece  may not be able to draw on a fifth
tranche of the International Monetary Fund’s portion of a
bailout loan it received. German two-year notes also rose after
inflation unexpectedly eased this month, reducing the need for
higher  interest rates . Irish bonds fell for a third week,
raising 10-year yields to a record high.  “There’s been some worsening in sentiment over the past
few days. Juncker’s comments were unsettling,” said  Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA in
Milan. “So far, the 3 percent yield level has proved a solid
psychological barrier” on 10-year bunds “and it will take
further deterioration in sentiment to significantly break
through it,” Cazzulani added.  The 10-year bund yield declined seven basis points in the
week to 2.98 percent as of 4:42 p.m. in London yesterday, after
earlier reaching 2.97 percent, the lowest since Jan. 12. The
3.25 percent security due July 2021 rose 0.63, or 6.3 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 102.28. Yields on two-year notes fell
20 basis points in the week to 1.57 percent, the least since
March 18.  Bund Streak  Benchmark bund yields have declined for seven consecutive
weeks, their longest downward slide since January 2001, as
investors purchased the securities as a buffer against the euro-
region’s worsening debt crisis. Juncker told a conference in
Luxembourg on May 26 that he didn’t think the IMF, European
Union and  European Central Bank  were confident Greece could
guarantee its debt repayments over the next 12 months.  “There are specific IMF rules and one of those rules says
that IMF can only take action when the refinancing guarantee is
given over 12 months,” said Juncker. “I don’t think that the
troika will come to the conclusion that this is given.”  German  government bonds  have handed investors a return of
0.1 percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and
Bloomberg, while Treasuries have returned 2.6 percent. Greek
bonds have lost 13.13 percent in the period, the data show.  “Core paper continues to enjoy a flight to quality bid,”
said  Richard McGuire , a senior fixed-income strategist at
Rabobank in London.  Greek Yields Fall  Greek 10-year yields declined 15 basis points in the week
to 16.42 percent, narrowing the spread between Greek 10-year
debt and similar-maturity German bunds for the first week in
three. Two-year Greek yields dropped 22 basis points in the week
to 25.25 percent.  Spanish 10-year bond yields declined 16 basis points this
week to 5.32 percent, while Portuguese 10-year yields increased
20 basis points to 9.58 percent. Italian 10-year bond yields
fell three basis points to 4.74 percent over the week.  Belgian 10-year government bond yields declined eight basis
points in the week to 4.14 percent. Dexia, the French-Belgian
bank that’s forced to shrink its balance sheet by 35 percent by
2014, said May 27 it will take a charge of 3.6 billion euros for
the anticipated sale of mostly U.S. residential mortgage-backed
securities and long-term bond disposals.  Irish 10-year bond yields surged 52 basis points in the
week to 11.06 percent, after reaching a euro-era record of 11.19
percent on May 27, the same day that a report that showed retail
sales contracted 0.8 percent in April from the previous month.  The move widened the spread, or yield difference, between
benchmark Irish bonds and German debt of similar maturity to a
euro-era record 821 basis points, before easing to 807 basis
points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
