Kevin McHale has agreed in principle
to a three-year deal plus a team option to become the next
coach of the  Houston Rockets , the Houston Chronicle reported.  The Chronicle, which did not say where it got the
information, reported yesterday that McHale was offered the
position over Boston Celtics assistant coach Lawrence Frank and
Dallas Mavericks assistant Dwane Casey.  A voice message left for Rockets spokesman Nelson Luis was
not immediately returned. The Rockets announced April 18 that
Rick Adelman would not return after a four-year stint as
Houston’s coach.  McHale, 53, a Hall of Fame player for the Celtics in 1980-
93, worked in the front office for the  Minnesota Timberwolves 
in 1995-2008 and spent parts of two seasons as coach of the
Timberwolves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
