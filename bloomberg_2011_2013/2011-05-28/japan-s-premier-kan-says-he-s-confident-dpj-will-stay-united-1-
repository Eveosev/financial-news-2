Japan ’s Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said
he’s confident that the ruling  Democratic Party  of Japan will
maintain unity even as opposition lawmakers threaten to bring a
no-confidence vote against him.  “I trust that the party will be able to respond in a
united way,” Kan told reporters in Brussels today after the
completion of the Group of Eight summit in Deauville, France.
“For now, we are doing everything we can to bring the accident
to a resolution,” he said, referring to the nuclear disaster at
the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant.  Sadakazu Tanigaki, head of the main opposition  Liberal
Democratic Party , said May 26 he “definitely” will submit a
no-confidence motion against the government, reflecting mounting
discord over Kan’s handling of the worst nuclear crisis in 25
years.  Political gridlock has also prevented the government from
pushing through legislation to sell bonds that would fund almost
half of this year’s record 92.4 trillion yen ($1.14 trillion)
budget, prompting Kan to add today that he would like to reach
out to the opposition to resolve their differences.  “This bill is essential to the implementation of the
budget and to the management of our finances,” he said. “It is
this government’s responsibility to break through this wall.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
