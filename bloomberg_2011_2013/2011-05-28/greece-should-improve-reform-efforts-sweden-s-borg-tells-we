Greece  needs to improve its reform
efforts, Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg told German
newspaper  Die Welt  in an interview.  Talks about a re-profiling of Greece’s debt or about
extending the maturity of Greek  government bonds  or other forms
of relief would only start when the county achieves a “very
substantial” surplus, the newspaper cited Borg as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
