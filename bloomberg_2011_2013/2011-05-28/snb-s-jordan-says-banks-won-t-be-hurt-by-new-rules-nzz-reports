The new Swiss banking rules which
require banks including  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  to
increase their capital, won’t impair the banks’ competitiveness,
Swiss National Bank Deputy Chairman Thomas Jordan said in an
interview with  Neue Zuercher Zeitung .  It is “important” the banks keep their headquarters in
Switzerland, the Zurich-based newspaper quoted Jordan as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
