Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP) ,
 India ’s largest drugmaker by market value, said fourth- quarter
profit rose 12 percent, beating analyst estimates as sales at
its Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. unit jumped.  Net income was 4.43 billion rupees ($98 million), or 4.3
rupees a share, in the three months ended March 31, compared
with 3.94 billion rupees, or 3.8 rupees, a year earlier, the
company said in a statement today. Profit exceeded the 3.57
billion-rupee average of 23 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales climbed 36 percent to 14.6 billion rupees.  Taro, 70 percent owned by Mumbai-based Sun, said yesterday
that sales for the quarter rose 21 percent to $107.7 million.
Sun bought a controlling stake in Yakum, Israel-based Taro in
September to gain access to manufacturing facilities in  North
America  and a portfolio of cardiac and skincare medicines.  The acquisition “has enhanced our presence in the U.S.
market,” Chairman Dilip Shanghvi said in the statement. “We
continue to file new products on our own and evaluate further
acquisition opportunities.”  Nine generic drugs were introduced in India in this
quarter, and domestic sales grew 20 percent from a year earlier,
Sun said. Full year sales increased 43 percent.  Sun rose 1 percent to 444.95 rupees in Mumbai trading
yesterday. That pared the stock’s decline this year to
8.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
