Greece ’s privatization program should
be more ambitious,  Welt am Sonntag  said, citing an interview
with European Central Bank Executive Board member Juergen Stark.  While there have been improvements in the austerity
program’s implementation, Greece needs to be “more ambitious”
than its plan to generate 50 billion euros ($71.4 billion) from
privatizations until 2015, Stark told the newspaper.  Greece owns real estate and stakes in publicly listed
companies with a sales potential of up to 300 billion euros,
according to expert estimates, Stark told the newspaper. He said
a part of that has to be made available to reduce the country’s
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
