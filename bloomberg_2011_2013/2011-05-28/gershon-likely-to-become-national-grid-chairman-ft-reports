National Grid Plc, operator of the
U.K.’s power-distribution network, is likely to name Peter Gershon as its next chairman, the Financial Times reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Former BP Plc Chief Executive Officer  John Browne , who was
also considered for the role, may have faced political
difficulties as chairman because of the 2005 blast at BP’s Texas
City refinery,  the FT said , citing people close to National
Grid. The decision is expected at the company’s annual meeting
in July, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
