Zimbabwe’s Movement for Democratic
Change leader, Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai , will
“vigorously” oppose calls by President  Robert Mugabe ’s
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party for
elections this year, the  Daily News  said, citing Tsvangirai.  Zanu-PF  have demanded elections to end a power-sharing
agreement between the two parties should be held in 2011, the
Harare-based Daily News said on its website. The  MDC  will oppose
any elections until the southern African country has a new
constitution that protects people from violence, the Daily News
quoted Tsvangirai as saying.  The MDC leader challenged Mugabe to declare publicly that
he is not a murderer at a party rally held in the western
district of Plumtree, near the border with neighboring Botswana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
