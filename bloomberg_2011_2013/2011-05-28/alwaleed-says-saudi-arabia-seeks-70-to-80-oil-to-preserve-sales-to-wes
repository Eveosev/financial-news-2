Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said an oil
price of $70 to $80 a barrel is in the best interests of  Saudi
Arabia  because it diminishes the urgency in the U.S. and  Europe 
to develop alternative energy sources.  “We don’t want the West to go and find alternatives,”
Alwaleed, a nephew of Saudi King Abdullah, said in an interview
on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS,” scheduled for broadcast today.
“The higher the price of oil goes, the more they have
incentives to go and find alternatives.”  The rebellion in Libya, political turmoil in Bahrain and
speculative buying are responsible for driving oil prices to
more than $100 a barrel, Alwaleed said. Crude for July delivery
rose 36 cents to settle at $100.59 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  May 27. Prices have increased 35 percent in
the past year.  Alwaleed, who owns  Citigroup Inc. (C)  shares and ranks 26th on
Forbes magazine’s list of the world’s richest billionaires with
a net worth of $19.6 billion, said he continues to invest in the
U.S. and that the nation is “down, for sure, but it is not
out.”  Standard & Poor’s  lowered its U.S. credit-rating outlook
on April 18 to negative, citing the widening budget deficit.  Saudi Arabia needs to enact laws that allow for greater
public participation in government, Alwaleed said. U.S.
President Barack Obama’s administration is seeking to encourage
pro-democracy movements inspired by those that ousted longtime
leaders in Tunisia and Egypt as part of the so-called Arab
Spring to create broader, regional changes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
