U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
will visit  South Korea  this week to meet government ministers
and U.K. companies trading there before a free-trade agreement
between the nation and the European Union takes effect.  Cable will also launch an investment report detailing to
Korean firms business opportunities existing in the U.K., the
government’s  U.K. Trade and Investment  department said in an e-
mailed statement.  South Korean lawmakers in May passed a free-trade agreement
with the EU, enabling the world’s second-biggest trade deal to
come into effect on July 1. The accord, which will remove up to
97 percent of tariffs on trade and goods in three years, may
generate as much as 500 million pounds ($826 million) to the
U.K. economy, according to the statement.  “ Korea  offers countless opportunities for UK companies of
all sizes, and across a number of sectors,” Cable said in the
statement. “Korea is set to make the 10th largest contribution
to world growth over the next five years and will become one of
the most attractive export destinations globally. There has
never been a better time to engage with this market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
