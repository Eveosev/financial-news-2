Coalition air forces have targeted
the walls of Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s complex in central
Tripoli, the U.K. said today.  “RAF Typhoons, along with other NATO aircraft, last night
used precision guided weapons to bring down guard towers along
the walls” of the Bab Al Aziziyah complex, Chief of the Defence
Staff Strategic Communications Officer, Major General John
Lorimer, said in an e-mailed statement.  The military action “sends a powerful message to the
regime’s leadership and to those involved in delivering Colonel
Qaddafi’s attacks on civilians that that they are no longer
hidden away from the Libyan people behind high walls.”  Russia  yesterday said it’s seeking to negotiate the exit
from power of the Libyan leader, for the first time supporting
the goals of the military campaign in  Libya  led by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. Qaddafi has forfeited his right 
to govern and Russia is using its contacts with the Libyan 
regime’s leadership to persuade him to step down, President 
 Dmitry Medvedev  said in Deauville,  France , after a Group of 
Eight summit.  French support for the coalition intervention in Libya has
stabilized as 55 percent of people queried favored the action
from 54 percent a month ago, Dimanche Ouest-France said today,
citing a poll conducted by Ifop.  Support has slipped from the campaign’s start, when 66
percent of people polled 10 days after the air operation began
told Ifop they were in support of it, the newspaper said. The
poll of 1,006 people was conducted by Internet between May 24
and 26.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
