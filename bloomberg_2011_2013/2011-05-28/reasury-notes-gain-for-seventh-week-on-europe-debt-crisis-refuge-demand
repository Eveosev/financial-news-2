Treasury notes gained for a seventh
week, the longest streak in more than two years, as concern the
debt crisis in  Europe  is worsening and signs of slowing growth
in the world’s largest economy stoked demand for the relative
safety of government debt.  Two-, five- and seven-year notes gained as investors bid
the most in almost 17 years for five-year debt and since seven-
year securities were reintroduced in 2009 at auctions this week,
while benchmark 10-year notes appreciated for a second week.
U.S. government data showed the economy grew more slowly than
forecast in the first three months of the year. Employers added
fewer jobs in May than in April, according to a Bloomberg News
survey before the June 3 report.  “As long as Europe is in this tenuous position, you’re
going to have some safe-haven flow into U.S. fixed-income,”
said Scott Sherman, an interest-rate strategist at Credit Suisse
Group AG in  New York , one of 20 primary dealers that trade
directly with the Federal Reserve. “It will take some time to
remove the uncertainty.”  The yield on the 10-year note fell eight basis points or
0.08 percentage point to 3.07 percent from 3.15 on May 20. It
touched 3.04 percent yesterday, the least since Dec. 7. The
3.125 percent security due in May 2021 rose 19/32, or $5.94 per
$1,000 face amount, to 100 14/32.  Yield Drops  Two-year yields fell four basis points to 0.48 percent,
five-year note yields dropped seven basis points to 1.72 percent
and seven-year notes declined eight basis points to 2.40
percent. The streak of declines in seven-year yields is the
longest since the security was reintroduced in 2009. The runs of
declines in two-and five-year yields were last seen in November
and December of 2008.  Treasuries have returned 1.44 percent in May, heading for
the best month since August, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch data. They rose 1.15 percent in April and have
returned 2.47 percent so far this year.  At the May 26 seven-year note auction, the securities drew
a yield of 2.429 percent, compared with the average forecast of
2.448 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of nine primary
dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with amount of securities offered, was
3.24, the highest level since February 2009, the beginning of
records on the data for this maturity.  Bid Patterns  The government’s $35 billion auction of five-year
securities May 25 drew the highest bid-to-cover ratio since
1994, while demand at the sale of the same amount of two-year
debt on May 24 was the strongest since January.  Yields on 10-year yield on German bunds fell a for seventh
week, closing below 3 percent for the first time since January
as investors sought safe assets amid concerns about the need to
restructure Greek debt and as inflation slowed.  European confidence in the economic outlook weakened for a
third straight month in May as the region’s worsening debt
crisis and surging commodity costs clouded growth prospects. An
index of executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-member euro
region slipped to 105.5 from 106.1 in April, the European
Commission in Brussels said yesterday.  “We’re going to have this lingering backdrop for a
while,” said  Michael Cloherty , head of U.S. interest rate
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit in
New York, a primary dealer. “You don’t resolve Europe in a
weekend. You’re looking for things they can do that buy them
time. ”  Global Outlook  Group of Eight leaders said a strengthening global economy
will pave the way to cuts in the debt built up during the
recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis.  “The global recovery is gaining strength and is becoming
more self-sustained,” according to a statement yesterday after
a two-day summit in Deauville,  France . President  Barack Obama 
told leaders that the  U.S. budget deficit  limited the country’s
ability to act as the engine of the global economy, the European
diplomats said.  America’s gross domestic product grew at 1.8 percent annual
rate in the first quarter, Commerce Department figures showed
May 26. The gain was the same as estimated last month and
compared with a 3.1 percent increase in the prior quarter. The
median forecast of 82 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a revised 2.2 percent gain.  U.S. employers may have added 185,000 jobs in May, compared
with 244,000 in April, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 68 economists. The nation’s
unemployment rate is projected to fall to 8.9 percent from 9
percent.  “The economy remains tepid, growth is tepid, which in the
mindset of the marketplace pushes the  Federal Reserve  on hold
probably longer,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury
trading in New York at Bank of Nova Scotia.  The Fed’s target rate for overnight lending between banks
will rise to 0.5 percent by the first quarter of 2012, according
to median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
central bank has kept its target rate at zero to 0.25 percent
since December 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
