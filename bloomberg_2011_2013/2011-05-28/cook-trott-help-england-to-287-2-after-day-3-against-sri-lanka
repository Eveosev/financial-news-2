Centuries from Alastair Cook and
 Jonathan Trott  helped England pull within 113 runs of  Sri Lanka 
after day 3 of the first cricket Test in Cardiff.  Cook was 129 not out and Trott an unbeaten 125 as England
reached 287-2 on a rain-shortened day. England began play 47-1
and lost nightwatchman James Anderson, who edged to Mahela
Jayawardene at slip from Ajantha Mendis, without adding to its
total. Cook and Trott then teamed for a stand of 240 that took
the host to stumps.  Sri Lanka reached 400 all out in its first innings, led by
Prasanna Jayawardeneâ€™s 112 runs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
