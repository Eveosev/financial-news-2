Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  has experienced
disruptions in its  computer networks  that may be the result of a
security breach at a vendor, the New York Times reported, citing
unidentified industry officials.  Lockheed, the world’s biggest defense company, first
detected an intruder trying to break into its network on May 22,
the newspaper said, citing unidentified officials. The company
shut down most of its remote access and provided new SecureID
electronic tokens and passwords to workers, the Times said,
citing company employees.  EMC Corp.’s RSA unit said it was hit by a cyber attack in
March that resulted in some information being taken from its
systems, including data related to RSA’s SecurID authentication
products.  Lockheed Martin declined to comment on the RSA breach.
“However, to counter any threats, we regularly take actions to
increase the security of our systems and to protect our
employee, customer and program data,” the company said in an e-
mailed statement.  Kevin Kempskie, a spokesman for EMC’s RSA division said
“By policy, we don’t comment on security issues or security
strategies at our customers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
