Yemen’s opposition called for
President Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down immediately, backing
away from a Gulf agreement on a 30-day transitional period.  “The accord as it stands is no longer acceptable to us
unless it provides for his immediate departure,” Mohammed al-
Mutawakkil, a member of the opposition Joint Meeting Parties’
higher council, said in a telephone interview in the capital
Sana’a.  “The protesters didn’t approve of it in the first place,”
he said. “And with the clashes this week, the tribesmen can no
longer accept it.” Al-Mutawakkil said the opposition wants
powers to be transferred to Saleh’s deputy.  Scores of people were killed this week in clashes in Sana’a
pitting Saleh’s security forces against tribesmen loyal to Sadiq
al-Ahmar, who leads Yemen’s most influential group of tribes,
the Hashid confederation. The casualties included tribal
mediators who died when al-Ahmar’s home was bombed.  The clashes began May 23 after Saleh refused to sign a Gulf
Cooperation Council-brokered accord that provides for him to
step down within 30 days of accepting the agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
