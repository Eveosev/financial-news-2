Desarrolladora Homex SAB,  Mexico ’s
largest homebuilder, may renegotiate covenants on credit lines
with local banks, said investor relations officer Vania Fueyo in
a telephone interview from Culiacan, Mexico.  Homex is seeking to revise the covenants to reflect changes
in accounting in which revenue from home sales cannot be
recognized until the buyer receives the house’s deed, Fueyo
said. Previously, Homex used an accounting system that could
book revenue from home sales while construction was underway.  “The company does not expect to breach any covenant and
moreover expects to deliver neutral to positive free  cash flow 
as of year-end,” she said.  Fueyo declined to name the terms being proposed or the
banks involved because the negotiations are private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
