U.S. stocks fell a fourth straight
week, the longest slump in 15 months, as concern Europe’s debt
crisis is worsening overshadowed rallies by commodity producers
and a Group of Eight forecast for faster economic growth.  The S&P 500 pared its loss yesterday, gaining 0.4 percent,
after G-8 leaders said a strengthening economy will help nations
cut debt. Utilities, health-care stocks and household-products
makers fell the most among 10 industries in the index, losing 1
percent or more, as investors sold stocks least-dependent on
economic growth. Fuel and metal producers gained the most,
adding 2 percent. Luxury retailer  Tiffany & Co. (TIF)  surged 10
percent after raising its profit forecast.  The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 1,331.10 this week. It
dropped throughout May after reaching an almost three-year high
on April 29. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost 70.46 points,
or 0.6 percent, to 12,441.58 this week.  “The market is seesawing back and forth, trying to assess
these spectacular risks which live on the front page of the news
and weigh them against strong corporate profitability,” said
 Stephen Wood , the New York-based chief market strategist for
Russell Investments, which manages about $161 billion.  The S&P 500 has retreated 2.4 percent this month, fueled by
concern Greece is struggling to avoid default and weaker-than-
forecast economic data, including a decline in U.S. housing
starts. Before this week, the advance since the  S&P 500 ’s 2011
low on March 16 was led by health-care stocks, followed by
consumer companies that sell necessities, telephone networks and
utilities, as investors sought havens. The trend reversed this
week as commodity producers surged.  Debt Crisis  Stocks decreased on May 23, giving the S&P 500 its biggest
drop in two months, amid concern that the economic rebound is
slowing and Europe’s debt crisis is worsening. The Federal
 Reserve Bank  of Chicago’s gauge of economic activity
unexpectedly dropped below zero in April, meaning the national
economy is experiencing below-trend growth.  In Europe, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero’s Socialist party suffered its worst defeat in more
than 30 years in local elections amid a backlash over austerity
measures. Italy’s credit-rating outlook was revised to negative
from stable by S&P on May 20. Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker,
who leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said the
 International Monetary Fund  may not release its portion of a 12
billion-euro ($17.2 billion) aid payment to Greece next month.  Utilities in the S&P 500 declined 1.7 percent, the most
among 10 industries. PG&E Corp., a power company based in  San
Francisco , dropped 3.8 percent to $43.10. Integrys Energy Group
Inc. slumped 3.2 percent to $51.97.  Medco, Hormel  Health-care shares in the S&P 500 slumped 1.2 percent, led

benefits to federal employees, winning the deal away from Medco.

percent.  Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL) , which makes cold cuts and packaged
foods, fell 3.5 percent to $29.03.  Safeway Inc. (SWY) , a grocer,
declined 2.7 percent to $24.52.  S&P 500 gains were led by raw-material and energy stocks,
which advanced more than 2 percent.  AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS) 
rallied 8.2 percent to $15.29.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX)  increased 6.9 percent to $51.73.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  climbed

agencies gave a fiscal full-year forecast that missed analysts’
estimates. The company has been hurt by delays in federal

the U.K. government’s National Health Service.  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  sank 6.2 percent to
$28.88. The Treasury sold 200 million shares at $29 each,
compared with the most-recent closing price of $29.46. The
government, which retains a majority stake, must sell shares at
an average of about $28.73 to recover a $47.5 billion
investment.  LinkedIn Corp. declined 5.1 percent to $88.32. The first
major U.S. social-media company to go public more than doubled
following its initial public offering last week, prompting
investors such as Gamco Investors Inc.’s Lawrence Haverty to say
the stock is overvalued.  The S&P 500 rose yesterday, finishing a three-day rally,
after consumer sentiment increased to a three-month high in May
and the Group of Eight leaders said that a strengthening global
economy will pave the way to cuts in the debt built up during
the recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis.  Europe  vowed to fight its fiscal woes with
“determination,” while President Barack Obama promised a
“clear and credible” U.S. deficit-reduction strategy.  Tiffany rallied to its highest level since its May 1987
IPO, gaining 10 percent to $76.50 for the second-biggest
