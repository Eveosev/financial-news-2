French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  will travel to Brazil on May 30 as part of an effort to
broaden support in developing countries for her candidacy to
head the International Monetary Fund.  The one-day visit to Brazil won’t include other stops, a
spokesman at the Finance Ministry said today. He declined to be
cited by name, under department policy. Lagarde will also travel
to China, though a date hasn’t been set.  Lagarde, who announced her candidacy May 25, has won
endorsements from across Europe. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin yesterday voiced his support for her, joining the U.K.,
Germany and Sweden. IMF executive directors representing Brazil,
Russia, India, China and  South Africa  have protested a
presumption that the fund’s next chief come from  Europe .  France’s Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned from the post
after being arrested on charges of sexual assault and attempted
rape in New York. Lagarde would be the first woman to lead the
IMF since its founding in 1945.  To contact the reporter on this story:
