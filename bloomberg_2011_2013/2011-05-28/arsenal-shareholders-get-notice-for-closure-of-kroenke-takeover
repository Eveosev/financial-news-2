Arsenal Football Club said it has
received the Premier League’s confirmation that Stan Kroenke has
completed its change of control processes to its satisfaction.  Kroenke has now given a formal 14 days notice for the
closure of his unconditional offer to shareholders as part of
the process for his takeover of the club, Arsenal said in a
statement today.  The offer for Arsenal is wholly unconditional and “we now
look forward to a new and exciting phase in the life of the
club,” Arsenal Chairman Peter Hill Wood said in the statement.
“The plan is to maintain the PLUS listing provided there are a
sufficient number of shareholders for that to be permitted.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
