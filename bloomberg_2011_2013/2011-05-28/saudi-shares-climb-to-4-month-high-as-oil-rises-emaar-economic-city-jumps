Saudi Arabian shares rose to the
highest level in four months as oil prices gained after leaders
of the Group of Eight nations said the global economy is
strengthening.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s biggest
petrochemicals maker, and  National Industrialization Co. (NIC)  led the
gains.  Emaar Economic City (EMAAR)  gained the most in almost three
years.  The 146-member  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  climbed 0.4 percent
to 6,751.11, the gauge’s highest level since Jan. 17, at the
3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh. Three shares rose for every stock
that dropped and the index rallied for a third day, extending
quarterly gains to 2.9 percent.  “Recent negativity out of Europe is being shrugged off by
local investors as the return of oil above $100 is at the
forefront of investor minds,” said Amro Halwani, a senior
trader at Shuaa Capital PSC in Riyadh. “This is keeping Saudi
petrochemical equities on high demand.”  Crude oil for July delivery gained 0.4 percent to settle at
$100.59 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Brent oil
for July settlement was settled at $115.03 a barrel. Saudi
Arabia holds one-fifth of the world’s proven oil reserves.  Sabic gained 0.5 percent to 107.75 riyals, the highest
price since May 22, after Chief Executive Officer Mohamed al-
Mady said the company plans to expand in China and Saudi Arabia
this year. National Industrialization gained 1.2 percent to
42.20 riyals, its highest price since July 8, 2006.  Al Rajhi 
rose 0.3 percent to 76 riyals.  “The market remains very prone to volatility as
speculators continue to dominate the flows on mid and small cap
companies,” said Halwani.  Emaar Economic, a unit of Dubai’s Emaar Properties PJSC,
rose 9.5 percent, its largest gain since Nov. 29, 2008, to 8.10
riyals, after raising 5 billion riyals ($1.3 billion) from the
Saudi government to finance construction of real-estate projects
in the kingdom.  Saudi Arabia ’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
open on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
