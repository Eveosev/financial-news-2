     May 28 (Bloomberg) ---  Egypt  plans to pay mobile-phone
operators 100 million pounds ($16.8 million) in compensation for
harm incurred due to the disruption of communications during a
popular uprising in January, state-run  Middle East News Agency 
reported, citing Communications Minister Magued Osman.  The security services under the former regime were
responsible for cutting Internet and mobile-phone services,
Osman said, according to MENA.  Mobile and Internet services were suspended on Jan. 28
following mass demonstrations calling for an end to Hosni
Mubarakâ€™s three decade-rule. Mobile-phone voice services, run by
local units of  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ,  France Telecom SA (FTE)  and
Emirates Telecommunications Corp., were restored a day later,
and Internet services returned on Feb. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
