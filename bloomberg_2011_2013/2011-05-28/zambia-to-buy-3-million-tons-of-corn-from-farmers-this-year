Zambia will buy all of the 3 million
tons of corn farmers harvested this year, President Rupiah Banda
said today in a broadcast on the privately owned Radio Phoenix.  Banda didn’t say where the money to purchase the corn would
come from. Zambia had a bumper harvest after corn production
rose 20 percent from the last crop, the agriculture minister,
Eustackio Kazonga, said in May.  Banda announced the purchases, electricity reforms and road
repairs almost two months after he was chosen as the ruling
party’s candidate for presidential elections in October.
Spreading out the fee of about $160 to connect to electricity
will improve access, Banda said.  “Instead of paying 767,000 kwacha, which most Zambians
cannot afford to do at once, the payment will be done over three
years in installments aimed at ensuring that power reaches more
Zambians this year,” he said in Lusaka.  The southern African country will roll out solar panels to
provide heated water nationwide. The program will be financed
through government funds in conjunction with the state power
company, Zambia Electricity Supply Corp., Banda said.  In a bid to “fight illiteracy,” Zambia will spend $3
million from the Ministry of Finance and National Planning to
refurbish the nation’s largest university, the University of
Zambia or UNZA, with more than 15,000 students, the president
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
