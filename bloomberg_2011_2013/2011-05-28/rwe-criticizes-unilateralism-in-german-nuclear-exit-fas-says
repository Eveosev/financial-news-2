RWE AG (RWE)  criticized the German
government’s “unilateralism” in preparing a law for an
accelerated nuclear exit,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung 
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer  Juergen Grossmann .  Energy companies are currently involved “to a very small
degree” in the planned legislation, FAS quoted Grossmann as
saying.  It’s “irresponsible” to keep Germany’s seven oldest
nuclear plants, which were idled during a three-month review of
atomic energy policy, permanently offline considering the threat
of imminent energy supply shortfalls, Grossmann told FAS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
