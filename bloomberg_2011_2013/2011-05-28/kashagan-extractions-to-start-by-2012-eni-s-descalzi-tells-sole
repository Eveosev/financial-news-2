Extractions at the Kashagan field
will start at the end of 2012 or in the following months at the
latest, Claudio Descalzi, head of exploration and production for
 Eni SpA (ENI)  told Il Sole 24 Ore in an interview.  Italy’s biggest energy company “won’t do an about-face,”
he told the newspaper, adding that Eni’s expectations about
profitability of the field “are more than positive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
