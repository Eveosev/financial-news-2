U.S. President  Barack Obama  said
“backsliding” by Belarus as political repression intensifies
could be harmful to neighbors in eastern  Europe .  “A country like Belarus is backsliding,” Obama said after
a meeting today with Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski in
Warsaw. “The kind of repressive actions we’re seeing in Belarus
can end up having a negative impact on the region as a whole,
and that makes us less safe and makes us less secure.”  Obama said yesterday that the U.S. will pursue new
sanctions against some Belarusian state-owned enterprises
following the conviction and sentencing of opposition
presidential candidates. The measures would be in addition to
travel restrictions, asset freezes and other sanctions announced
in January.  “The United States considers these candidates and the
other courageous activists and candidates arrested and charged
in conjunction with the crackdown on Dec. 19 as political
prisoners,” Obama said in a written statement distributed
yesterday as he attended the Group of Eight summit in Deauville,
France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
