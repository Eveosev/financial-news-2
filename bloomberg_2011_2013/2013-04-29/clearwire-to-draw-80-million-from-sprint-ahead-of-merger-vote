Clearwire Corp. (CLWR)  said it will draw
$80 million in financing from  Sprint (S)  Nextel Corp. for a third
straight month, leaning on its majority owner for funding as it
awaits a shareholder vote on Sprint’s takeover proposal.  The financing, part of a prearranged agreement with
 Overland Park , Kansas-based Sprint, can be exchanged for
Clearwire stock at $1.50 a share under certain conditions.
Bellevue, Washington-based Clearwire, which has struggled to
profit from its wireless Internet service, still has $400
million of financing available from Sprint, it said in a filing
late on April 26.  The move gives Sprint a way to tighten its grip on
Clearwire as a rival suitor,  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  seeks to wrest
control of the wireless Internet company’s valuable airwaves --
perhaps by acquiring Sprint itself. Dish, the Englewood,
Colorado-based satellite-TV company, has offered $25 billion for
control of Sprint and $3.30 a share for Clearwire stock, more
than Sprint’s $2.97-a-share offer.  Clearwire shareholders are scheduled to vote on Sprint’s
offer May 21. Sprint is also considering a $20 billion takeover
proposal from Tokyo-based  SoftBank Corp. (9984) , with a tentative date
of June 12 for a shareholder vote on that transaction. Sprint’s
board has a special committee reviewing the Dish bid.  The Wall Street Journal reported the Clearwire funding
decision earlier today.  Clearwire was unchanged at $3.44 at the close in New York.
Sprint was unchanged at $7.12, and Dish gained 1.4 percent to
$40.56.  To contact the reporter on this story:
