Chateau Palmer , a third-growth
wine estate in Bordeaux’s Margaux district, priced its 2012
vintage at 160 euros ($210) a bottle, just 1 percent below its
2011 level, Decanter.com said.  The decision leaves Palmer’s 2012 wines priced 88 percent
above its 2008 vintage, according to Decanter magazine’s
website. Chateau Talbot, a fourth-growth Saint-Julien, released
its 2012 wines at 26.40 euros a bottle, unchanged from the 2011s
after having cut its prices by 33 percent last year,
