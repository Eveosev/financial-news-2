South African corn futures rose for
a third day after U.S. prices climbed on speculation a
government report will show planting slowed in the country,
which is the biggest producer of the grain.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
gained 1.3 percent to 2,155 rand ($238) a metric ton by the
close on the South African Futures Exchange. The yellow variety
for delivery in the same month advanced 1.6 percent to 2,140.80
rand a ton.  Four percent of corn crops in the major U.S. producing
states were  planted  as of April 21, behind the five-year average
pace of 16 percent, the Department of Agriculture said April 22.
Corn for July delivery increased as much as 2.1 percent on the
Chicago Board of Trade today.  “The U.S. corn price was driven up because they are
battling to plant quickly enough,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at
BVG (Pty) Ltd., said by phone in  Pretoria . “Our corn was given
a push by that because we follow the U.S.’s price.”  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
White corn is a staple food, while the yellow variety is mainly
used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in July dropped 0.3 percent to 3,379
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
