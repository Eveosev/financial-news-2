Mexico’s currency strengthened and
benchmark peso bonds rose to a record as speculation mounted
that global central bank stimulus will encourage foreign
investment in the country’s higher-yielding assets.  The peso climbed 0.1 percent to 12.1283 per  U.S. dollar   at
10:13 a.m. in Mexico City. It has strengthened 6 percent this
year, the best performance among the most-traded Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  European Central Bank policy makers may cut  interest rates 
this week, according to the majority of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The  Federal Reserve  will consider renewing its
commitment to bond buying at a two-day meeting starting
tomorrow. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda announced this
month a doubling of monthly bond purchases, helping the peso
surge 20 percent against Japan’s yen in 2013.  The peso and its peers “are appreciating this morning on
market optimism generated by the continuation of global monetary
stimulus in an environment of low inflation risks and a
deceleration in growth,” Juan Carlos Alderete, a strategist at
Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, said in an e-mailed research
report today.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 4.52 percent today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.21 centavo to 149.53
centavos per peso, a record high on a closing basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
