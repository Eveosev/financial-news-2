Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp will stay at the west London club next season when it’s
relegated to  England ’s Championship, the team said.  Redknapp met with QPR Chairman Tony Fernandes today and
pledged to remain, the club said on its website. QPR and Reading
were relegated from the Premier League yesterday when their
match finished 0-0.  “We’re going to give it a real good go next season,
though, and hopefully get this club back to where it belongs,”
Redknapp said in the  statement . “We’ve got to rebuild and get a
team together that can be really competitive in the
Championship.”  Redknapp, 66, took over in November. QPR is his fifth
 coaching post  since 2002.  Fernandes said Redknapp won’t be forced to sell any
players, and the executive said he was “disappointed” by the
reaction of some squad members who didn’t seem to be upset when
the team lost.  To contact the reporter on this story:
