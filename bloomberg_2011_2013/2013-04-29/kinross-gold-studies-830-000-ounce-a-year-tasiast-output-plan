Kinross Gold Corp. (K) ,  Canada ’s third-
largest gold miner, will start a feasibility study on expanding
its Tasiast mine in Mauritania with a 38,000 ton-per-day mill.  A plant that size will “provide optimum economics” for
the mine, Toronto-based Kinross said today in a statement,
citing a preliminary study. The company expects to complete the
feasibility study in the first quarter of 2014, after which it
will decide whether to finish the engineering work and begin
construction on the expansion.  “The decision to proceed will be based on a number of
considerations, such as  energy supply , operating costs, capital
costs and of course the gold price,” Chief Executive Officer J. Paul Rollinson said today on a conference call. “We’ve got a
lot of gold in the ground and we have a lot of options.”  Kinross acquired Tasiast as part of its C$8 billion ($7.9
billion) purchase of Red Back Mining Inc. in 2010. The company
said in February it took a $3.09 billion writedown on the
project after it scaled back an expansion plan and mining-
industry capital and operating costs increased. Tasiast
currently has a processing capacity of 8,000 tons a day, the
company said.  Rollinson, who replaced Tye Burt as Kinross’s CEO in
August, is seeking to lower production costs and improve
spending discipline. The company forecasts 2013  capital spending 
will drop to $1.6 billion from $1.92 billion last year.  Comparing Options  “The priority for us is balance sheet strength and we are
going to keep the balance sheet strong,” Rollinson said today.  Kinross originally planned to build a 60,000-ton-per-day
ore-processing mill at Tasiast, and in February said it was no
longer considering that option.  The company said in August it was studying a 30,000-ton
project to compare the economics.  The pre-feasibility study announced today showed that under
the 30,000-ton scenario, so-called all-in sustaining costs at
Tasiast would be $735 an ounce of gold with average annual gold
output 830,000 ounces in the first five years of production.  The initial capital cost for the project at that size was
estimated at $2.7 billion, Kinross said today. Kinross assumed a
gold price of $1,500 an ounce of gold in calculating the project
economics and $1,200 for designing the mine pit.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  and  Goldcorp Inc. (G)  are the largest
Canadian gold miners by sales.  Kinross fell 2.2 percent to C$5.44 at 9:49 a.m. in Toronto.
 The shares  have dropped 44 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
