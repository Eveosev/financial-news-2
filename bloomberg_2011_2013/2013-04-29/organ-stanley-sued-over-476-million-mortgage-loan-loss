Morgan Stanley (MS)  and WMC Mortgage
Corp. were sued by Seagull Point LLC over $476 million in losses
from securitized  mortgage loans .  Seagull claimed that the banks breached agreements on
residential mortgage loans in 2006 and 2007, according to a
filing dated April 26 in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan.  Morgan Stanley, based in New York, securitized more than
5,800 residential mortgage loans in 2007 that were ultimately
sold to Seagull, according to the complaint. Some of the loans
were delinquent at the time of the offering, Seagull said.  “Defendants are required to comply with their contractual
obligations to repurchase the mortgage loans already identified
as breaching representations and warranties,” Seagull said in
the complaint.  The case is Seagull Point LLC v. WMC Mortgage Corp.,
651519/2013, State Supreme Court of  New York , County of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
