The cost of insuring corporate
bonds in Australia against non-payment fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 1 basis point to
110 basis points as of 10:43 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices. The benchmark is headed for a 13
basis-point drop this month and has fallen 17.5 basis points
this year according to Westpac and data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was unchanged at 111.5 as of 8:32 a.m.
in  Hong Kong ,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  prices show. The
gauge has ranged from 100.5 basis points to 122.3 basis points
since Dec. 31, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  Markets in Japan are closed today for a public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
