Broadwind Energy Inc. (BWEN) , a Cicero,
Illinois-based producer of steel towers, rose the most in more
than six months after announcing a $34 million order from a U.S.
wind-turbine manufacturer.  Broadwind rose 13 percent to $4.72 at the close in  New
York , the most since Oct. 18.  The company will build the towers at its facility in
Abilene,  Texas , and plans to begin delivering them by the fourth
quarter of 2013, according to a statement today. The buyer was
not identified.  “This order starts to fill the capacity in our Abilene
facility into 2014,” Chief Executive Officer Peter Duprey said
in the statement. “This provides our tower business with better
visibility further into the future.”  The U.S. wind industry is expected to slump this year after
a record 13,000 megawatts of capacity were installed in 2012 as
developers raced to complete projects before a tax credit
expired Dec. 31. The credit was renewed for wind farms that
begin construction by the end of 2013, which will spur demand
for the next few years as those new  power plants  are planned and
built, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
