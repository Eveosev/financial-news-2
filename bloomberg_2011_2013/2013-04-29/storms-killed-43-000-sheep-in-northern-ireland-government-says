Storms last month in the U.K.
killed at least 43,000 sheep and goats in  Northern Ireland ,
after animals were stranded by snowdrifts at the time in early
spring when lambs are typically born.  About 30,413 lambs and 12,587 ewes, rams and goats were
killed after storms in late March, according to preliminary data
released today by Northern Ireland’s Department for Agriculture
and  Rural Development . About 1,159 cattle also were killed. The
government hasn’t finished tallying the number of animals.  Livestock  losses  in the U.K. in the first three months of
this year totaled 148,647 sheep, up 15 percent from the same
period a year earlier, and 82,883 cattle, up 6.1 percent,
according to an April 3 report from the National Fallen Stock
Company, a non-profit agency established by the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and administrations in
 Wales ,  Scotland  and Northern Ireland. Statistics may be higher
as carcasses are unmasked by melting snow, the company said.  As of December, Northern Ireland had about 1.3 million
 sheep  and lambs, 2.5 percent more than a year earlier, according
to the agriculture department.  Northern Ireland Agriculture Minister Michelle O’Neill said
the department will pay for the collection and disposal of the
dead animals. Defra has said it will make as much as 250,000
pounds ($387,225) available to  farmers  in England for the cost
of removing killed sheep.  To contact the reporter on this story:
