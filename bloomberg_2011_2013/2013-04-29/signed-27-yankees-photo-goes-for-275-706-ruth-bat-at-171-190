An autographed photo of the 1927
 New York  Yankees’ World Series champions sold at auction for
$275,706, while a game-used bat from the team’s Hall of Fame
outfielder Babe Ruth went for $171,190.  Also, the personal collection of eight-time National
Basketball Association champion John Havlicek sold for more than
$1 million. The top lots in that collection were his NBA 50
Greatest Players autographed lithograph ($80,750) and his 1973
Boston Celtics championship ring ($68,481).  The items were all part of Laguna Niguel, California-based
SCP Auctions Inc.’s April sale, which included about 1,000
sports memorabilia items and brought in more than $5.1 million,
according to an e-mailed release. Dan Imler, the company’s vice
president, said it drew the most collectors and bids in SCP’s
34-year history.  “The passion that collectors have for top-quality sports
memorabilia and cards, particularly items with direct athlete
provenance, is at an all-time high,” Imler said in the release.  The winning bidders wish to remain anonymous at this time,
SCP said in the release.  The 1927 Yankees featured a lineup nicknamed Murderer’s
Row, which included future Hall of Fame members Ruth, Earle
Combs, Lou Gehrig and Tony Lazzeri. The  photo  is signed by all
28 players from the team, in addition to Hall of Fame manager
Miller Huggins and a team trainer.  Ruth became the first player to hit at least 60 home runs
in a season that year, and finished his career with a .342
batting average, 714 home runs and 2,220 runs batted in. The bat
sold in the auction dates to the 1921-31 period, when he was a
member of the Yankees.  Gretzky Jersey  Other items from the auction include a Wayne Gretzky game-
used jersey from his time with the National Hockey League’s
Edmonton Oilers, sold for $110,293; and Ray Nitschke’s 1967
Green Bay Packers Super Bowl ring, which went for $91,151.  A pair of sneakers that three-time NBA Most Valuable Player
LeBron James wore in a game as a tribute to those affected by
the December school shooting in Newtown,  Connecticut , sold for
$27,584. Proceeds from that sale will go to those affected
through the LeBron James Family Foundation, according to the
release.  The auction was to include the jersey that Yankees
outfielder Reggie Jackson wore when he hit three home runs in
Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. The item was pulled this month,
when SCP said further research was needed to determine its
authenticity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
