The zloty appreciated the most in
three weeks ahead of the European Central Bank decision on
interest rates this week and as investors cheered a new
government in  Italy .  The currency advanced 0.6 percent to 4.1324 per euro at
3:01 p.m. in Warsaw, the biggest gain since April 8. The yield
on  two-year  securities fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to a record 2.65 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Italy’s government bonds rose, pushing 10-year yields
toward the lowest level since October 2010, as the swearing-in
of a new prime minister yesterday ended nine weeks of political
deadlock. The European Central Bank will reduce its main
refinancing rate by a quarter of a percentage point from the
current all-time low of 0.75 percent, according to the median
forecast from a Bloomberg survey of economists. The U.S. Federal
Reserve will start a two-day policy meeting tomorrow.  “The zloty gains as there’s a general risk-on mode on the
markets,” Marcin Turkiewicz, a foreign-currency trader at BRE
Bank SA in Warsaw, said by e-mail today. “Investors expect a
dovish comments from the Fed and that the European Central Bank
will cut rates which will increase the interest-rate
disparity,” with  Poland  and make zloty assets more attractive,
he said.  Poland’s main interest rate is at a record low of 3.25
percent since March, driving down the  spread  over the ECB’s key
rate to 250 basis points, the lowest since January 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
