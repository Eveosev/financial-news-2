Shazam Entertainment Ltd., maker of
a song-identification application, said Rich Riley joined the
company as chief executive officer, replacing  Andrew Fisher , who
is becoming executive chairman.  Most recently, Riley was executive vice president for the
Americas at Yahoo, London-based Shazam said today in a
statement. John Pearson, who had been chairman since 2006, will
become a non-executive director, the company said.  Shazamâ€™s audio-matching app for smartphones and tablets can
identify almost any song playing on the radio. The technology
uses algorithms to decipher unique elements in snippets of music
to help pinpoint the name of the tune.  Yahoo, the largest U.S. Web portal, said in June 2012 that
Riley was leaving amid management turnover after former CEO
 Scott Thompson  stepped down as a result of misstatements about
his academic record. Riley joined Sunnyvale, California-based
Yahoo in 1999 and had previously served as senior vice president
and managing director of Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
