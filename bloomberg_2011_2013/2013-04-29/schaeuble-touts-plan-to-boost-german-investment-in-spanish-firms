German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  agreed on a plan to boost investment in smaller
companies in  Spain  at a meeting today with his Spanish
counterpart, Economy Minister Luis de Guindos.  “There is a lot of money in the banks and at the  European
Central Bank  but not enough investment,” Schaeuble said at a
joint press conference at a country hotel near Granada in
southern Spain. “That is where we want to take measures.”  The two countries backed a program that will seek
“sponsors” who will encourage investors in Germany, Spain and
other countries to provide equity financing for competitive
companies, said de Guindos. Increasing the capital of smaller
companies will help them tap bank financing, he added.  The  International Monetary Fund  has called on Germany to
allow peripheral euro members to ease up on austerity policies,
and Schaeuble signaled last week that he will join the European
Commission in endorsing Spain’s decision to postpone by two
years its program to meet the European Union’s 3 percent budget
deficit limit.  The Spanish government last week forecast that its
 unemployment rate  will remain around 25 percent until at least
2016 as it tries to reboot the economy while meeting European
demands backed by Germany for budget cuts.  The joint German-Spanish program aims to avoid “the long
route through European institutions” and instead see both
governments engaging together with lenders, Schaeuble said. The
ministers didn’t say how much money they hoped to raise through
today’s agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
