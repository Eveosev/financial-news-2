JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Washington
Mutual Inc. and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  were sued by Integer Program LLC
over $301 million in losses from  mortgage loans .  Integer claimed that the banks breached a 2007 mortgage
loan purchase agreement, according to the suit filed April 26 in
New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.  Washington Mutual securitized more than 4,600 residential
mortgage loans that were eventually sold to Integer, according
to the complaint. The alleged breaches occurred on more than
1,400 loans.  “Over 60 mortgage loans were delinquent as of the
applicable cut-off date and/or the date of the closing of the
offering of the certificates to the public,” Integer said in a
court filing. “These breaches have not been remedied by the
responsible parties.”  The case is Integer Program LLC v. JPMorgan Chase Bank
North America, 651518/2013,  Supreme Court  of the State of New
York, County of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
