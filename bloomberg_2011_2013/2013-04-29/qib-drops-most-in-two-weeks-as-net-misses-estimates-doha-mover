Qatar Islamic Bank headed for the
biggest drop  in two weeks  after the Shariah-compliant lender’s
first-quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates.  Shares of the bank lost 1.9 percent, set to decrease the
most since April 14, to 68.6 riyals at 12 p.m. in Doha as volume
jumped to two times the three-month daily average. The stock was
the  biggest decliner  on the benchmark QE Index, which slipped
0.2 percent.  Qatar Islamic, whose shares have fallen 8.4 percent this
year, reported a 25 percent retreat in quarterly net income to
291 million riyals ($80 million), missing the 360 million-riyal
average estimate of five analysts compiled by Bloomberg. That
was the  fourth straight  quarterly decline in earnings for the
bank, which also  missed estimates  in the fourth quarter,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The stock price will be under pressure because numbers
have been down for two or three quarters now,” Doha-based
Abdullah Amin, senior research analyst at Qatar National Bank
Financial Services, said by phone. “Loans are down, deposits
are also down. We need more clarity.”  Financing income declined 3.9 percent to 471 million
riyals, and income from fees and commissions declined 45 percent
to 54.44 million riyals, according to the lender’s financial
statements. Financing assets fell 12 percent, while liabilities,
including deposits, dropped 2.7 percent.  Eight analysts  have a hold rating on Qatar Islamic’s shares
while one recommends buying it, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
