Oils produced on the  Gulf Coast 
weakened after domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate
trimmed its discount to  Brent crude  to the narrowest level since
January 2012.  WTI sold for a $9.31-a-barrel discount to Brent based on
settlement prices, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. When
WTI strengthens versus Brent, it typically weakens the value of
U.S. grades that compete with foreign crudes priced against the
international benchmark.  The premiums for Light Louisiana Sweet and Heavy Louisiana
Sweet over WTI both weakened by 15 cents to $11 a barrel and
$11.25 a barrel, respectively, at 2:14 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Eugene Island crude and Bonito Sour weakened by 50 cents to
$8.75 over WTI.  Poseidonâ€™s premium weakened 5 cents to a $6.25 a barrel
premium and Mars Blend also weakened 5 cents, to $6.75 a barrel
over WTI. Southern Green Canyon strengthened 15 cents a barrel
to a $5 premium.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, was
unchanged at $9 a barrel over WTI.  Bakken was unchanged at a discount of $3.50 a barrel
against WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
