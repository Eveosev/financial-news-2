The central bank of Angola,
 Africa ’s biggest oil producer after Nigeria, kept its benchmark
interest rate unchanged for a third month as inflation
accelerated.  The key lending rate was left at 10 percent, the Luanda-
based Banco Nacional de Angola said in a statement on its
website yesterday. The bank lowered the rate by a quarter of a
percentage point in January, only the second cut since it was
introduced in October 2011.  Inflation quickened to 9.1 percent in March from 9 percent
in the previous month, the statistics office said on April 12.  The bank said it’s decision was based on inflation data,
conditions in the economy and credit demand to “contribute to
the maintenance of price stability.”  The Monetary Policy Committee was created to help improve
financial management after  Angola  secured a loan from the
International Monetary Fund in 2009. The southern African
nation, which is also the world’s fifth-biggest diamond producer
by value, is rebuilding its economy after a 27-year civil war
that ended in 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
