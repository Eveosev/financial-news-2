(Corrects April 29 story to show lawsuit is from
pensioners.)  Transnet SOC Ltd.,  South Africa ’s
state-owned port and rail operator, is facing an 85.5 billion
rand ($9.4 billion) class action lawsuit from members of its
pension and benefit funds.  The “legacy debt” owed to Transnet Pension Fund and
Transnet Second Defined Benefit Fund by the company was a
combined 80 billion rand as of the end of March, Wynanda
Coetzee, a lawyer at  Pretoria , South Africa-based  Geyser &
Coetzee Attorneys , which is representing the pensioners, said in
a statement on the company’s website.  A further 5.5 billion rand shortfall was caused by canceled
bonds that deprived the funds of cashflow and assets, according
to the statement. Mboniso Sigonyela, a spokesman for Transnet,
declined to comment.  “To date Transnet refuses to pay the outstanding legacy
debt,” Coetzee said. “The state and Transnet would have gained
substantial financial benefit from the refusal to defray the
debt owed.”  Two members of the funds have lodged an application to the
North Gauteng High Court requesting the institution of a class
action against Transnet, Coetzee said.  Rapport , an Afrikaans-
language newspaper based in  Cape Town , reported the case
earlier.  Wynanda Coetzee couldn’t be reached for further comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
