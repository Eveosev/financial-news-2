Turkey ’s benchmark  bond yields  sank
for a fifth day to a record as investors speculated the central
bank would continue to lower  interest rates .  Yields on the two-year notes dropped before the release of
the bank’s quarterly inflation review tomorrow. The next rates
decision is scheduled for May 16. The bank has lowered at least
one of its main three interest rates in every month since
September, including a 50 basis point cut to the benchmark one-
week repo rate this month to a record 5 percent.  “The market is currently pricing in new rate cuts,” Erkin Isik, a fixed-income strategist at  Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK)  in
Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments today. “The rates outlook
from now on will depend on the central bank’s position.”  Yields on the two-year notes slipped 16 basis points, or
0.16 percentage point, to 5.22 percent at the close in Istanbul,
the lowest level on record. One-year interest rate swaps, which
investors use to speculate on the future direction of rates,
slumped 18 basis points to 5.62 percent, the steepest slide
since Feb. 15 and also the lowest on record.  Turkish bonds are the best performers across 20 major
 emerging markets  over the past 12 months, with yields declining
396 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
lira strengthened 0.3 percent to 1.7936, extending its gain this
month to 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
