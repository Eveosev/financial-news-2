Grupo Gayosso SA, a Mexican
operator of funeral homes, pulled its planned sale of as much as
$150 million of bonds, according to a person familiar with the
transaction.  The company may still try to sell the bonds at a later
date, said the person, who asked not to be named because the
decision is still private.  Raul Cervantes, a marketing official with Grupo Gayosso,
didnâ€™t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the
offering. Phone calls to his office went unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
