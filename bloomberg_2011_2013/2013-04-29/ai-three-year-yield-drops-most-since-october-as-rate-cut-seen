Thailand ’s government bonds rose,
with the benchmark three-year yield dropping the most since
October, on speculation the central bank will cut borrowing
costs. The baht was little changed.  Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said April 26 that a
reduction in the nation’s policy rate will stem capital inflows
that helped push the baht to a 16-year high this month, and the
Bank of Thailand has agreed to take that into account. The U.S.
reported April 26 that economic growth in the first quarter rose
at a 2.5 percent annualized rate, less than the 3 percent
economists had forecast.  “Some investors are betting on a rate cut from the BOT as
one of the options still available” to reduce capital inflows,
said Nalin Chutchotitham, a Bangkok-based analyst at
Kasikornbank Pcl. “Bonds also got some support because of the
weak data from the U.S.”  The yield on the 3.125 percent notes due December 2015
dropped six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 2.79
percent as of 10:53 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That was the biggest decline since Oct. 18, and
the rate was at the lowest level since November 2010.  The central bank has kept the  benchmark interest rate  at
2.75 percent for the past four meetings, drawing criticism from
Finance Minister Kittiratt, who said the higher rate attracts
inflows, putting appreciation pressure on the baht. The monetary
authority next reviews policy on May 29.  Inflows, Baht  Foreign funds  bought  $1.99 billion more sovereign debt than
they sold this month, adding to net purchases of $9.62 billion
in the first quarter, Thai Bond Market Association data show.  The baht was little changed at 29.25, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The currency dropped 2 percent last week, the
biggest five-day decline since January 2007 amid concern the
monetary authorities will impose measures to stem inflows. That
pared its advance this year to 4.5 percent, still the best
performance among the 11 most-traded Asian currencies. The baht
touched 28.56 on April 22 and April 19, the strongest level
since July 1997.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, climbed 28 basis
points to 5.35 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
