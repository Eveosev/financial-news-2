El Paso County Hospital District is
selling $255.7 million in debt, its largest offering, as bonds
from hospital issuers outpace the broader $3.7 trillion muni
market.  The issue set to price tomorrow includes $139.9 million in
tax and revenue certificates of obligation for renovating and
expanding the University Medical Center of El Paso, according to
deal documents. Another $115.8 million in general-obligation
bonds will be sold to refinance higher-cost debt.  The $150 million project includes three new outpatient
clinics to boost access to  health services , said Michael Nunez,
the district’s chief financial officer. The 395-bed acute-care
facility serves  Texas ’s sixth-largest city and is a teaching
hospital for Texas Tech University’s medical school.  “We’re trying to alleviate the costs from the more
expensive emergency-room visits,” Nunez said by telephone.  The district covers 1,058 square miles (2,740 square
kilometers) with a population of more than 800,000, said  Fitch
Ratings , which grades the debt AA, its third-highest score and
one step higher than the AA- from Standard & Poor’s.  The sale is the largest for the district since it was
formed in 1958, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The El
Paso hospital’s general-obligation debt will total $391 million
after the offering, according to the documents.  Officials aim to achieve a borrowing cost of less than 4.5
percent, Nunez said. Almost all the obligations to be refinanced
carry a 5 percent interest rate, the documents show.  Hospital debt returned about 1.96 percent this year through
April 25, compared with 1.42 percent for the broader U.S. muni
market,  Standard & Poor’s  indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
