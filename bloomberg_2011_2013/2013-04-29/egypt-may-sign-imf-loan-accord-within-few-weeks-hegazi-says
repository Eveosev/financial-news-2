Egypt  is making “huge progress”
in its talks with the  International Monetary Fund  for a $4.8
billion loan and an accord may be signed within a “few weeks,”
Finance Minister El-Morsi El-Sayed Hegazi said.  Discussions over the long-delayed loan, seen by Egypt as
critical for unlocking billions of dollars more in foreign
funding, were continuing and the IMF team would return to the
country after videoconferencing talks were finished, Hegazi told
reporters.  Egypt’s efforts to conclude the final agreement hit
repeated obstacles, as the country’s post-2011 uprising
transition degenerated into divisive politics and chronic unrest
that has battered the economy of the Arab world’s most populous
nation. Hany Kadry, a top Finance Ministry official involved in
the talks, submitted his resignation in the latest twist.  Hegazi said in an interview today that Kadry’s resignation,
which had yet to be accepted, would not affect the loan talks.  Egypt has been trying to rein in spending, taking
politically sensitive measures such as scaling back a subsidy
system that consumes over 25 percent of  government spending .
Hegazi said the talks with the IMF were focusing on technical
issues and also addressed energy subsidies.  Cuts in the subsidy system present the government of
President Mohamed Mursi with a challenge, as they could
intensify tensions in the nation ahead of parliamentary
elections that Mursi has suggested could begin in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
