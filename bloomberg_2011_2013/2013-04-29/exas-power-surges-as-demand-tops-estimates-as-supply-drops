Wholesale electricity on the main
Texas grid jumped as demand exceeded forecasts and generating
capacity tripped offline.  The  spot price  for on-peak power briefly topped $900 a
megawatt-hour in North Texas. The high temperature in  Dallas  was
forecast to be 88 degrees Fahrenheit (31 Celsius), 8 above
normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,
 Pennsylvania . The grid managed by the Electric Reliability
Council of Texas Inc. issued an  advisory  at 2:19 p.m. Central
time that the amount of reserves dropped below 3,000 megawatts.  Spot Texas power averaged $170.25 a megawatt-hour from 2:15
p.m. to 4:45 p.m. local time, after trading mostly in the $30s
to $50s since 8 a.m., data from Ercot’s  website  show.  “Load is running just over the forecast and we have seen
some generation trip today,” said Robbie Searcy, an Austin-
based spokeswoman for Ercot, which manages the flow of power to
23 million Texas customers. “We don’t have any serious issues
on the system right now, but that’s why you are seeing prices go
up.”  Searcy declined to identify the power generation that shut
down. While prices rose across the Ercot grid, prices are
trending even higher at the North hub, according to grid data.  Electricity consumption  was 43,068 megawatts at 4:15 p.m.
The grid operator expects demand to peak at 43,223 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
