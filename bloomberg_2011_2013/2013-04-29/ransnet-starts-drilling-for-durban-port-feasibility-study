Transnet SOC Ltd.,  South Africa ’s
state-owned port and rail authority, yesterday started drilling
near Durban on the country’s east coast in a feasibility study
for a new port that may cost as much as 100 billion rand ($11
billion).  “We are looking at the option of partnerships and we are
looking at a build, operate and transfer model,” Chief
Executive Officer Brian Molefe told members of the Wentworth
community, south of Durban today. “At the moment we are testing
expressions of interest, but even if there is no interest it
will still go ahead.”  The plan is one of 18 designated Presidential Strategic
Infrastructure Projects and is part of Transnet’s 300 billion
rand investment plan to upgrade and expand port and rail
infrastructure.  Residents of Wentworth are opposed to the project that will
require them to be relocated to make room for the port and
related services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
