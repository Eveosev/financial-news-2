The energy services unit of Veolia
Environnement, the largest water company in  Europe , extended a
contract with Bratislava authorities in Slovakia for 20 years
that’s valued at at least 1.1 billion euros ($1.4 billion).  Dalkia, jointly owned by Veolia and Electricite de  France ,
has operated in the eastern European country since 1993. Dalkia
said it has provided heat and hot water the past 12 years to
Bratislava’s Petrzalka district, which with 40,000 households is
the largest residential district in central Europe.      Veolia shares have risen six consecutive trading days and
almost 14 percent this year compared with French water rival
Suez Environnement’s 19 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
