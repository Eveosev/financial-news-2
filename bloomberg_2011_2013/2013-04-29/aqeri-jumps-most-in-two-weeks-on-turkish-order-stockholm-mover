Aqeri Holding AB (AQER)  rose the most in
almost two weeks in Stockholm trading after the Swedish maker of
computer and communication products for extreme environments
received an order from Turkish defense company Aselsan.  The  shares jumped  as much as 16 percent to 4.62 kronor, its
steepest gain since April 16, and traded 15 percent higher at
4.6 kronor as of 12:44 p.m. local time.  Aqeri has signed a contract with Aselsan valued at 1
million kronor ($153,000), which may result in two additional
orders valued at 6 million kronor and as much as 40 million
kronor, respectively, in the future, the Spaanga, Sweden-based
company said in a statement. The order for computers, screens
and communication equipment will be delivered this quarter.  “It’s likely that Aqeri now has even better possibilities
to win a bigger serial contract, which could then be followed by
the really big serial contract at the end of the year,” Chief
Executive Officer Manne Koerfer, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
