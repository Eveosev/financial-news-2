Mexico ’s central bank would
consider cutting interest rates for a second time this year if
the annual inflation rate fell below 4 percent, bank Governor
Agustin Carstens said today.  Adverse weather conditions and other factors that pushed
inflation above the central bank’s target range are expected to
be temporary, Carstens said in an interview today with Radio
Formula. Inflation should slow to within the 2 percent to 4
percent target range in the second half of the year, he said.  “Perhaps once we’re in this circumstance there’s a
possibility to consider an additional movement,” Carstens said.
“But while this inflationary hump, so to speak, doesn’t ease,
and we don’t have the certainty that it will ease, it’s
difficult to carry out an additional movement on interest
rates.”  The central bank cut  rates  by half a point on March 8 to a
record low 4.0 percent after inflation slowed.  Since then, price-growth has risen back above the target
range, reaching 4.72 percent in the first half of April as a
frost in some northern states pushed up farm prices. The bank’s
board left rates unchanged on April 26, saying they expect
inflation to start slowing back toward their target range in
June.  The peso weakened 0.5 percent to 12.2068 per dollar as of 4
p.m. Mexico City time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
