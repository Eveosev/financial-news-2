Goldman Sachs (GS)  Group Inc. and  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  will start sending checks to borrowers foreclosed on by
the banks’ former mortgage-servicing units this week, according
to the Federal Reserve.  The two New York-based banks will pay $247 million to
almost 224,000 borrowers, the Fed said today in a statement. The
checks -- meant to compensate borrowers who may have been
mistreated in foreclosures during 2009 and 2010 that relied on
improper documentation or faulty procedures -- range from $300
to $125,000, depending on the how much harm may have been done.  Mortgage units owned by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley
foreclosed on homes of 49 military members eligible for borrower
protections and three homeowners who weren’t in default, the Fed
said. The loans were handled by Goldman Sachs’s Litton Loan
Servicing LP and Morgan Stanley’s Saxon Mortgage Services Inc.,
both of which were sold to  Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN)   The Wall Street firms were among 13 of the largest U.S.
mortgage servicers who agreed to a $9.3 billion settlement with
federal regulators that called for a total of $3.6 billion in
cash payments to borrowers and that the rest go to help prevent
future foreclosures. All borrowers targeted by foreclosure in
2009 and 2010 are scheduled to get some payment, whether or not
they were harmed by the banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
