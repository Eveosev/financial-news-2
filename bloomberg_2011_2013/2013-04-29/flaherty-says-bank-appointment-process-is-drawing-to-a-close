Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said the process of finding a replacement for Bank of
Canada Governor Mark Carney is drawing to a close.  “I said that we’re aiming at about the end of April, and
we’re about at the end of April, and the process is drawing to a
close,” Flaherty told reporters in Ottawa. He declined to say
if an announcement is coming tomorrow and didn’t mention any
candidates by name.  Economists in a Bloomberg survey after Carney announced his
departure named Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem as the most
likely replacement. The second-most likely candidate is Export
Development Canada Chief Executive Officer Stephen Poloz,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a March 19 report. The Globe and
Mail newspaper said Stanford University finance professor
Darrell Duffie is also a candidate.  “We aren’t quite at the end of the process, but we’re near
the end of the process,” Flaherty said. “So it won’t be too
long.”  Carney on Nov. 26 made the surprise announcement he would
leave on June 1 to take a job at the Bank of England a month
later.  Canada’s currency held earlier gains against its U.S.
counterpart, adding 0.5 percent to C$1.0115 at 4:08 p.m. in
Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys 98.86 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
