Former  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  Chief Executive
Officer  Andrew Mason , who was fired in February by the company
he co-founded, received a compensation package last year of
$5,291.  Mason’s compensation included a base salary of $756.72 in
2012, unchanged from the previous year, according to a filing
today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He also
received $4,534 in “other compensation,” which includes
health-care costs. He got no bonus or equity awards.  The  company  reduced Mason’s salary and bonus on his own
recommendation, according to the filing. Mason holds about 46.6
million shares in Groupon, worth about $292 million. He was paid
a base salary of $180,000 and bonus of $350,000 in 2010.  Groupon fired Mason earlier this year after the daily-deal
provider lost $723.8 million in the past three years. Chairman
Eric Lefkofsky, the co-founder with Mason, and Vice Chairman  Ted Leonsis  are running the company, which has undertaken a search
for a new CEO. Mason has also resigned from Groupon’s board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
