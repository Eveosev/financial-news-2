New York Mets pitcher Matt Harvey’s
performances are becoming can’t-miss for Major League Baseball
fans because his fastball is almost can’t-hit.  Harvey, the second-year right-hander who is 4-0 this season
heading into tonight’s start at the Miami Marlins, has batters
swinging and missing his top pitch a major league-best 35
percent of the time, based on  Bloomberg Sports  data through
April 25. Max Scherzer of the Detroit Tigers ranks second in
whiff percentage, as the statistic is called, at 22.2 percent,
and the following eight pitchers range from 21.8 percent to 20.5
percent.  Harvey’s fastball averages 94.76 miles per hour, trailing
only the 95.57 mph pitch of the Washington Nationals’  Stephen Strasburg . Strasburg’s whiff percentage, at 12.6 percent, ranks
48th out of 93 pitchers who have thrown at least 200 fastballs.  “I have not seen a power right-handed pitcher that throws
above 95 miles per hour command his fastball as well as Harvey
since Roger Clemens,” said Mitch Williams, a former major
league All-Star. “Right now, for me, he’s the best pitcher in
the game.”  Clemens won a record seven  Cy Young Awards  as his league’s
best pitcher during a career that spanned 1984-2007. His 354
wins rank ninth in major league history.  A comparison of the two pitchers’ first 15 career starts
shows Harvey with more early success than Clemens, who went 5-4
with a 5.02 earned run average, 74 strikeouts and 17 walks,
allowing batters to hit .309. Harvey, making 10 starts last
season and five in 2013, is 7-5 with a 2.29 ERA, 109 strikeouts
and 36 walks, allowing opponents to hit .172.  Better Ratings  Harvey’s hot start this season has yielded 14 percent
higher television ratings for SportsNet  New York , the Mets’
broadcast partner, when he pitches as compared with other games,
according to the network. TV ratings for adults in the 25-54 age
range have risen 35 percent when Harvey starts, even though one
of those outings came April 19 while many viewers were focused
on the manhunt for the Boston Marathon bombers.  Harvey, 24, was drafted with the seventh pick by the Mets
in 2010 out of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.  Williams, an analyst for MLB Network who pitched in the
majors from 1986-97, said in a phone interview that he began the
Clemens comparisons with Harvey’s first outing last season
because of his confidence.  “When the hitter looks out to the mound, he ain’t seeing
any question marks on Harvey’s face,” Williams said. “Harvey
knows what he’s going to do and he knows the hitter can’t beat
him and, trust me, hitters pick up on that.”  Fewer Fastballs  Harvey has relied less on the fastball this season than
last, using it 57.9 percent of the time compared with 65.3
percent in 2012. He also throws a slider, curveball and changeup.  “His slider is outstanding,” Williams said the day after
Harvey’s latest outing, a six-inning no-decision against the Los
Angeles Dodgers in which he gave up three earned runs. “Up
until last night, his curveball and his changeup were just show-
me pitches. Last night he used some good curveballs to put guys
away and threw some outstanding changeups.”  Harvey’s sophomore season continues tonight against the
Marlins and opposing pitcher Jose Fernandez, and he’s bringing a
trio of pitching weapons with him to Miami, said Williams.  “There is nothing in this game more dangerous than youth,
confidence and stuff,” Williams said. “He’s got all three.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
