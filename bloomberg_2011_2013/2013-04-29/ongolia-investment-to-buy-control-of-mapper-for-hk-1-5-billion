Mongolia Investment Group Ltd. (402) , a
water-services and mining company, said it will buy effective
control of a Chinese digital-mapping provider for HK$1.5 billion
($193 million) more than a year after first announcing the deal.  The company will fund the transaction with HK$600 million
in cash, raised through the private sale of 2.4 billion new
shares at 25  Hong Kong  cents each, according to Mongolia
Investment’s statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange
yesterday. It will also issue HK$900 million of zero-coupon
five-year convertible notes with a conversion price of 25 H.K.
cents a share.  Mongolia Investment initially announced the purchase of
Sinbo Investment Ltd. in December 2011. It changed the announced
structure at least once, according to earlier filings. Mongolia
Investment’s stock, which had been suspended since April 9, will
resume trading in Hong Kong today.  The target company owns Beijing Peace Map Information,
which has “structural agreements” that give it control over
the operations of Peace Map Group, a geographic information
services company, without having an equity stake, according to
the filing. Chinese law restricts foreign ownership of surveying
and mapping companies, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
