AccessKenya Group Ltd., the
nation’s only publicly traded Internet company, surged to a two-
year high on expectations of stronger first-quarter profit with
customer growth and investments in its network.  The stock advanced 7.5 percent to 10.10 shillings by the
close in Nairobi, the capital, the highest since February 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More than 865,000
shares were traded, or 1.8 times the three-month daily average.  AccessKenya, which currently offers service to Nairobi and
Mombasa, is expanding its fiber-optic network with a plan to
link to 10 additional towns, Chairman Daniel Ndonye said in the
company’s 2012 annual statement.  “The earnings will be driven by the target to connect 800
to 1,000 new corporate lease lines and the ongoing expansion”
to more urban areas, Ian Gachichio, a research analyst at
Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd., said by phone.  Profit last year rose 39 percent to 151 million shillings,
the company said on Mach 12. First-quarter results will probably
be released before AccessKenya’s annual meeting on May 27, said
Joy Migongo, a Kestrel Capital research analyst.  The stock has more than doubled this year, outpacing a 24
percent rise in the Nairobi Securities Exchange All Share Index,
the world’s third-best performing equities market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
