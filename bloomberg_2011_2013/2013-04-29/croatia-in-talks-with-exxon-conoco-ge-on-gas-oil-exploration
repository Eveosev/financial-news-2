Croatia, which is set to join the
European Union in July, is in talks with  Exxon Mobil Co. (XOM) ,
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  and  General Electric Co. (GE)  on investment in oil and
gas exploration in the  Adriatic Sea .  “They are all interested, and they are all waiting for the
government to pass the amended law on gas and oil research,”
Economy Minister Ivan Vrdoljak said in an interview in Zagreb.  Gas consumption in the former Yugoslav region and Albania
will double by 2020 to 11 billion cubic meters of gas a year,
according to an October 2011 study by state-owned pipeline
operator  Plinacro d.o.o.  Croatia wants to meet increased demand
across the region and reduce European dependence on Russian gas.  The Adriatic nation needs investment to revive growth after
four years of recession or stagnation. The government is
expected to adopt amended laws on hydrocarbon research by June,
Vrdoljak said.  INA Industrija Nafte d.d. ,  Croatia ’s largest refiner
controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt., so far has had a monopoly on
gas and oil exploration in Croatia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
