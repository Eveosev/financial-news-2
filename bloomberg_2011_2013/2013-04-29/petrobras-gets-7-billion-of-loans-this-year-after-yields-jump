Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the most
indebted publicly traded oil producer, has borrowed $7 billion
from banks and multilateral agencies this year after yields on
its bonds jumped in the past six months.  The loans, which are part of plans to raise $61 billion in
five years, will be followed by bond sales this year when
“market conditions are right,” Chief Financial Officer Almir Barbassa told reporters in  Rio de Janeiro  today. Yields on the
Rio de Janeiro-based company’s $5.25 billion of 2021 debt
reached a 14-month high of 4.2 percent on April 2.  Petrobras is raising cash to fund the development of the
world’s biggest oil discoveries this century as part of a $237
billion, five-year investment budget. The company plans to raise
about $20 billion through bond sales and loans this year,
Barbassa said.  The state-run company has earmarked 62 percent of its
spending plan for exploration and production, most of which for
recent discoveries in so-called pre-salt deep-water deposits. It
currently produces 300,000 barrels of oil a day in the area,
more than total output for  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  or Pan
American Energy LLC, the two largest Latin American oil
producers that aren’t state-controlled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
