Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA ,
Peru’s biggest precious-metals producer, said first-quarter
profit dropped for a fifth quarter on falling metals prices and
output, missing analysts’ estimates.  Net income plunged 51 percent to $102.7 million, or 40
cents a share, from $208.1 million, or 82 cents, a year earlier,
Lima-based Buenaventura said today in an e-mailed statement.
Analysts expected profit of 65 cents a share excluding one-time
items, the  average  of five estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Mines operated by  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  and  Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) , in which Buenaventura holds 44 percent and
18 percent stakes, respectively, contributed less to
Buenaventura’s earnings on lower gold, silver and copper prices
and declining output, said Inteligo SAB analyst Lali Merino, who
doesn’t own Buenaventura shares and rates the stock a buy.  “Earnings were hit by lower contributions from their
equity stakes as result of major output declines and lower
metals prices,” Merino said in a telephone interview from Lima
before the report was released. “Costs also rose as the company
is spending more on exploration.”  New York-traded gold and silver futures declined 5 percent
and 7 percent, respectively, while copper fell 6 percent in the
period.  Income from Buenaventura’s stake in Newmont’s Yanacocha
gold mine fell 42 percent to $51 million. Freeport’s Cerro Verde
copper mine, in which Buenaventura holds an 18 percent stake,
contributed $27.2 million, down 40 percent from a year earlier.  Falling Production  Revenue declined 6 percent to $354.7 million. Gold
production fell 12 percent to 243,811 ounces, while zinc and
lead rose 24 percent and 44 percent, respectively, Buenaventura
said. Silver output gained 12 percent to 4.72 million ounces.  Exploration spending rose 12 percent to $21.8 million.  Gold futures for June delivery rose 7.3 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $1,474.70 an ounce today on the Comex in  New York .
Silver gained 1.3 percent to $24.44 an ounce.  The report was released after the close of regular trading
today. Buenaventura’s American depositary receipts, each
representing one ordinary share, rose 34 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to close at $21.22 in New York. The ADRs have dropped 41 percent
this year.  (Buenaventura is scheduled to have its quarterly conference
