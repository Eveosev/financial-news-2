India’s 10-year bonds gained,
extending a four-week rally, on speculation slowing inflation
will prompt the central bank to cut borrowing costs.  Twenty-two of 26 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg predict
the  Reserve Bank  of India will lower its repurchase rate by 25
basis points to 7.25 percent on May 3, one forecasts a 50 basis
point reduction and three no change. Ten-year yields declined 22
basis points since March 29 as official data on April 15 showed
 wholesale  prices rose 5.96 percent in March, the least since
November 2009. Falling crude prices will ease pressure on the
current-account deficit, according to DBS Group Holdings Ltd.  “Prices below 6 percent are a sign of comfort for policy
makers to take growth-support measures,” said Radhika Rao, an
economist in  Singapore  at DBS. “Yields will stabilize at these
levels unless we see further declines in commodity prices.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 dropped
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.738 percent as
of 9:16 a.m. in Mumbai, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It
reached 7.735 percent on April 23, the lowest level for a
benchmark 10-year note since July 2010.  Crude prices have declined 13.7 percent to $102.65 a barrel
from this year’s high of $118.90 reached on Feb. 8.  India 
imports 80 percent of its annual oil requirement.  The nation’s gross domestic  product  rose 5 percent in the
fiscal year ended March 31, the weakest pace since 2003, the
statistics agency estimates. India’s growth outlook is improving,
the  International Monetary Fund  said in a regional report
published today. The RBI has cut its benchmark interest  rate  by
50 basis points this year  The one-year  interest-rate  swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.21 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
