Hungary’s forint rebounded the most
in six weeks as speculation the  European Central Bank  will cut
 interest rates  boosted the appeal of higher-yielding assets.  The forint appreciated 1.1 percent, the biggest intraday
advance since March 18, to 299.01 per euro by 5:14 p.m. in
Budapest, leading gains among 31 major peers tracked by
Bloomberg. It lost 2.9 percent in the previous eight sessions.  Most emerging-market currencies strengthened with the euro
as the majority of analysts polled by Bloomberg predicted the
ECB will reduce rates this week in an attempt to stem the
region’s recession. The U.S. Federal Reserve will meet tomorrow
to consider renewing its commitment to $85 billion a month of
asset purchases.  “Optimism that the ECB will cut interest rates is helping
currencies across the region, and the forint is typically more
volatile,”  Gaelle Blanchard , a strategist for  emerging markets 
at Societe Generale SA, said by phone from London. “The extent
of the move may be magnified by thin market liquidity. We don’t
see any news from Hungary affecting the market today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
