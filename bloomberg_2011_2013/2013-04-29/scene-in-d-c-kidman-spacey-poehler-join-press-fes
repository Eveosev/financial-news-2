Nicole Kidman , Amy Poehler,  Bradley Cooper , Barbra Streisand,  Sharon Stone  and  Kevin Spacey  were among the players of Hollywood, politics and the media gathered this past weekend for parties around the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner.  Spacey said former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton could count on his support if she decides to run for president in 2016.  “I love Hillary. I’ll always support Hillary,” said the actor, who portrays the House majority whip in the Netflix series “House of Cards.”  Stone praised Clinton’s “international clout” and overall performance as the nation’s top diplomat.  “Let’s see if she runs,” said Stone, in glasses, neck tie and trousers, at a garden brunch Saturday afternoon.  She was joined by Spacey and Kyle MacLachlan at the Beall-Washington House in Georgetown owned by Venturehouse Group LLC Chief Executive Mark Ein.  Congressman  Darrell Issa , California Republican, grabbed an oyster being passed under a huge tent where White House senior adviser David Axelrod was joined by Los Angeles Mayor  Antonio Villaraigosa  and a slew of media professionals.  Cupcakes with the  CURE Epilepsy  logo were served in honor of the organization co-founded by Axelrod’s wife, Susan.  The evening before, Rock the Vote held a party at the home of Lani Hay, the founder of Lanmark Technology Inc. Guests sang along to “Lightning Crashes” performed by the band Live in Hay’s living room.  Claire Danes  On Saturday night, media outlets hosted pre-dinner receptions. Claire Danes, in blue Prada, could be found in the Atlantic, National Journal and CBS tent with former Secretary of State  Madeleine Albright , Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, and Revolution LLC Chairman and CEO Steve Case.  After the dinner, French Ambassador Francois Delattre welcomed guests to his residence, the venue for the annual Vanity Fair-Bloomberg party.  Streisand and Cooper talked at the bottom of the staircase. Jessica Pare of “Mad Men” stood in black Antonio Berardi on the terrace of the residence overlooking an expansive lawn lit up with pastel lights.  “I feel like I’m in Narnia,” Pare said.  White House Press Secretary  Jay Carney  was on the terrace in line for a drink, while Poehler,  Michael Douglas  and  Ian McKellen  enjoyed the fresh air.  Harvey Weinstein  “Where’s Harvey?” asked Kidman, looking over the shoulder of her Pucci sequined gown, referring to Weinstein Co. co-founder  Harvey Weinstein .  Also chatting in the foyer of the imposing stone mansion were Maryland Congressman Steny Hoyer, the minority whip, and Jon Bon Jovi; singer Katy Perry and CNN anchor Piers Morgan.  Actress Kate Walsh wore a striking black-and-white floral Carolina Herrera. Michelle Dockery of “Downton Abbey” made a regal entrance in aubergine Elie Saab.  Attorney General Eric Holder swept across the parlor holding his wife’s hand. Senator  Debbie Stabenow , Michigan Democrat, and Senator Mark Warner, Virginia Democrat, were among the other legislators in the residence.  White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and United Nations Ambassador  Susan Rice  were among the establishment figures at the Italian Embassy for the MSNBC party where young congressional staffers hit the dance floor while a DJ cranked out pulsating tunes.  Rice held out until the wee hours, boogying to Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me).”  Anna Ancher  Friday evening the National Museum of Women in the Arts held its spring gala. Guests meandered through the current exhibition on the work of Danish painter Anna Ancher. Denmark’s Ambassador Peter Taksoe-Jensen was present for the dinner and dancing, which raised $402,500 for the museum.
