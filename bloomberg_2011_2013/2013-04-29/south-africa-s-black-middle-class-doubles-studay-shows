The black middle class in  South
Africa , which held its first all-race elections in 1994, has
more than doubled in size over the past eight years, exceeding
the number of white people in the same bracket and the amount of
money they spend.  The number of black  South Africans  classified as middle
class rose to 4.2 million people last year from 1.7 million in
2004, the University of  Cape Town ’s Unilever Institute of
Strategic Marketing said in a statement. South Africa has a
population of 51.8 million people.  “South Africa’s black middle class continues to rapidly
expand and is more influential and powerful than ever before,”
 John Simpson , a director at the Unilever Institute, said in the
statement, which was e-mailed yesterday. “The black middle
class is helping create a vibrant and stable society by
increasing South Africa’s skills base, deepening employment, and
widening the tax net.”  South Africans in this group now spend 400 billion rand
($44 billion) annually, more than the 323 billion rand spent by
3 million white people classified as middle class, according to
the study. The number of white South African in the group rose
from 2.8 million in 2004.  High Unemployment  South Africa’s unemployment rate of 24.9 percent is the
highest of more than 30 emerging-market nations tracked by
Bloomberg. Retail sales advanced 3.8 percent in February from a
year earlier, with South Africa’s  Reserve Bank  keeping its
benchmark  interest rate  at the lowest level in more than 30
years to spur spending.  To be classified as middle class, respondents had to meet
at least two criteria. They include having a household income of
between 15,000 rand and 50,000 rand, personal transportation,
tertiary education, employment in a white collar job, own or
rent a home for more than 4,000 rand a month in a city or town
and be 15 years of age or older. The full study will be released
next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
