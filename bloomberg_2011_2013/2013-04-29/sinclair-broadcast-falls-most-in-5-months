     April 29 (Bloomberg) --Shares in  Sinclair Broadcast Group
Inc. (SBGI) , owner of stations reaching more than a third of U.S.
television households, fell in New York trading after announcing
a stock offering to raise money, diluting investors’ stakes.  The stock dropped 2.9 percent to $26.69 at the close. Even
with today’s decline, the shares have more than doubled this
year.  Net proceeds from the offering of 14 million Class A shares
will be used for “potential acquisitions” or general corporate
purposes, the  Hunt Valley , Maryland-based company said in a
statement. Sinclair had 52.8 million Class A shares before the
offering, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The broadcaster, led by Chief Executive Officer  David Smith ,  has snapped up small- and mid-market broadcast stations
in the past 18 months, spending $1.84 billion in five deals,
according to Bloomberg Industries. The larger footprint allows
Sinclair to better negotiate with pay-TV systems such as Comcast
Corp. that pay fees to pick up local broadcast content.  The announcement comes after the company reported first-
quarter profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding some items, profit was 20
cents per share, compared with the 17 cents analysts predicted.
Sales were $282.6 million, missing analysts’ average estimate of
$298.5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
