Finavera Wind Energy Inc. (FVR) , a
Canadian renewable power developer, agreed to sell two wind
projects in British Columbia to Pattern Energy Group LP for C$28
million ($27.6 million).  Pattern will pay as much as C$9.3 million after the deal
closes, and the balance will be payable on a milestone basis as
the projects proceed to construction financing, Vancouver-based
Finavera said today in a statement.  The companies “prioritized” the purchase by Pattern of
Finavera’s Tumbler Ridge and Meikle projects, though Pattern
retains an option for two years to acquire its Wildmare and
Bullmoose projects, which were part of the original purchase
agreement announced in December. British Columbia Hydro & Power
Authority has agreed to purchase for 25 years the electricity
from the four projects that total 300 megawatts of capacity.  Finavera will repay debt with the sale proceeds and plans
to “embark on a fiscally prudent review of opportunities in the
marketplace within the next two to six months,” Chief Executive
Officer Jason Bak said in the statement. The company in October
said it was in talks with four potential bidders.  Bak didn’t immediately reply to phone and e-mail messages
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
