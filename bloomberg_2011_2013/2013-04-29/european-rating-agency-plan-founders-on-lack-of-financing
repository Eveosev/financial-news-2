An effort to establish a new global
ratings firm to challenge Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services,
Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings has foundered after
the initiators failed to obtain the 300 million euros ($393
million) needed to get the project off the ground.  Negotiations with a private European group of investors
ended without agreement, putting an end to the project to found
the European Rating Agency, Frankfurt-based Chief Executive
Officer Markus Krall said in an e-mailed statement today.  ERA was seeking to gain from a backlash against S&P,
Moody’s and Fitch, whose issuer-based payment model raised the
question of a conflict of interest that critics said meant they
may have fanned the financial crisis by inflating grades on
securities backed by subprime mortgages during the U.S. housing
boom. Their downgrades of euro-region states drew the ire of
policy makers trying to resolve  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis.  “Despite existing promises, we were unable to reach
critical mass for the start,” Krall said.  Krall’s model used a non-profit foundation approach that
would have removed the potential for a conflict of interest. The
effort failed in part because a lack of legislation meant it had
no legal basis, he said.  ERA was conceived more than three years ago, when, in
response to the financial market crisis, Roland Berger Strategy
Consultants GmbH sought to identify the institutional conditions
that may have increased systemic risks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
