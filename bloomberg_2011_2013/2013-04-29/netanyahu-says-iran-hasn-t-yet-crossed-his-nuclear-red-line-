Israel’s Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said today that  Iran’s nuclear program  has not yet
crossed the “red line” he set last year as the threshold for
risking an Israeli military strike.  “Iran is proceeding with its nuclear program,” Netanyahu
said today at a meeting of his Likud parliamentary faction in
Jerusalem. “It hasn’t yet crossed the red line I set down at
the UN, but it it is systematically approaching it, and must not
be allowed to cross it.” His remarks were broadcast on Israel’s
Army Radio.  Netanyahu told the  United Nations  last September that Iran
will have reached the final stage of its nuclear program when it
is “only a few months, possibly a few weeks” from making
enough highly enriched uranium to create atomic weapons. That
would probably occur this spring or summer, he said.  Netanyahu has said a nuclear-armed Iran would pose a threat
to his country’s survival and that “all options are on the
table” to prevent that from happening, including a military
attack.  Negotiations, together with diplomatic and economic
sanctions placed on Iran by the U.S. and European Union, have
failed to stop its  uranium enrichment . The Iranian government
says its nuclear program is intended solely for civilian
purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
