Serbia will repay early $400
million to the London Club of creditors tomorrow as the
government takes advantage of recent borrowing to retire older,
more expensive credits.  The move will save “1.1 billion dinars ($13 million) for
this year’s budget” and “about 1 to 2 billion dinars annually
in the coming years,” the Belgrade-based Finance Ministry  said 
in a statement today.  Junk-rated sovereigns, including Serbia and  Hungary , have
taken advantage of optimism about the global economic recovery,
while extra liquidity from central banks push investors to
higher-yielding assets. The London Club debt has an interest
rate of 6.75 percent, compared with the 5.15 percent yield on
the Balkan nation’s $1.5 billion sale of seven-year bonds in
February.  The government has pledged to cut the budget deficit to 3.6
percent of economic output this year from 6.7 percent in 2012,
while also reining in public debt.  “Fiscal policies contributing to decreasing of interest
rates on public debt on the international and the domestic
markets” will continue, the ministry said in the statement.  The London Club wrote down 62 percent of  Serbia ’s $2.7
billion debt in 2004, agreeing to a 20-year repayment, with
interest at 3.75 percent for the first five years and 6.75
percent for the remaining 15 years. The debt matures in 2024.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
