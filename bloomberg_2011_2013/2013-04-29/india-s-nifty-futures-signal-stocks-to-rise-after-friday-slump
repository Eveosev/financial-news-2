Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures gained,
signaling benchmark gauges may advance after slumping the most
in two weeks on April 26.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for May delivery rose 0.3
percent to 5,902 at 10:08 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index dropped 0.8 percent to 5,871.45 on April 26. The S&P
BSE Sensex index slid 0.6 percent to 19,286.72. Both gauges
slumped by the most since April 12. The Bank of  New York  Mellon
India ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares fell 1.2 percent.  The Sensex has rebounded 5.8 percent from a seven-month low
on April 9 as slowing wholesale-price inflation and a drop in
gold and oil prices stoked speculation the  Reserve Bank  of India
will lower  interest rates  this week. The central bank may pare
its key rate by 25 basis points at its May 3 review, according
to the median of a Bloomberg economist survey.  “The rally has caught a lot of people by surprise and the
RBI policy on May 3 has been the real trigger,” Sajiv Dhawan,
managing director at brokerage JV Capital Services, said in an
interview with Bloomberg TV India on April 26. “If the central
bank doesn’t cut rates, we could see the markets react quite
sharply.”  The Sensex is valued at 12.9 times  projected 12-month
profits , compared with a multiple of 10.3 for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index. The Indian gauge is still down 0.7 percent this
year, amid concerns about slowing economic  growth , a record
current-account deficit and the highest  inflation  rate among the
largest emerging nations.  Corporate Earnings  Hero MotoCorp Ltd. (HMCL)  may move today after reporting fourth-
quarter net income of 5.74 billion rupees ($106 million), more
than the 5.02-billion rupee median estimate of analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Consumer-goods maker  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) 
and  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) , India’s biggest copper
producer, are due to report earnings today.  Foreign funds bought a net $285.4 million of local shares
on April 25, taking their net investment in stocks this year to
$10.97 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Inflows last
year were $24.5 billion, the most among 10 Asian markets tracked
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
