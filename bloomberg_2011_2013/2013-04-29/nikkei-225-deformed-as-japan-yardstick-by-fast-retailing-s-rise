The Nikkei 225 Stock Average, the
benchmark measure for Japanese equities, is being twisted by a
single company more than at any time in the last 12 years.  Fast Retailing Co. (9983) , Asia’s biggest apparel retailer, was
responsible for almost a sixth of the gauge’s 49 percent advance
in the last two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
At 10 percent of the Nikkei 225, the clothier has almost twice
the combined influence of Toyota Motor Corp.,  Mitsubishi UFJ (8306) 
Financial Group Inc, Honda Motor Co.,  Japan  Tobacco Inc. and NTT
DoCoMo Inc., Japan’s five biggest companies by market value.  The skew in the Nikkei 225 caused by a single company
underscores the difference between stock averages, where ranking
is determined by a share price, and most indexes, where market
capitalization is key. The 62-year-old equity benchmark, owned
by Nikkei Inc., is the most common benchmark for pricing
derivatives on the country’s $4.39 trillion equity market. Open
interest for June Nikkei 225 futures stood at more than $96
billion on April 26, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The Nikkei 225 is deformed,” said  Norihiro Fujito , a
senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co., the brokerage unit of Japan’s biggest financial
group by market value. “It doesn’t properly reflect the
Japanese equity market even though the Nikkei is well known and
most attention is paid to it.”  Fast Retailing, operator of the Uniqlo chain of clothes
stores, skews the index so much that Mitsubishi UFJ, PineBridge 
Investment Japan Co. and Bayview Asset Management Co. say it’s 
no longer an effective gauge of the nation’s equity performance.
No company has had as much influence since at least 2000, when 
Bloomberg began collecting the data.  Direction Determined  Fast Retailing’s share price, which closed at a  record 
35,700 yen ($365) on April 26, may also be distorted because the
stock can be used to move the Nikkei 225, according to Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive officer of Myojo Asset Management Japan
Co., a Tokyo-based hedge-fund advisory firm.  “Proprietary traders at brokerages might be trading Fast
Retailing to manipulate the Nikkei,” said Kikuchi. “One single
company having such a huge impact on the index is problematic
and the index compiler has to address this issue.”  In the first four months of this year, the Nikkei 225 moved
in the same direction as Fast Retailing 13 out of 17 weeks,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The clothier’s
contribution to the Nikkei 225’s move  accounted  for an average
42 percent of the net gain or loss during those weeks, the data
show. The Nikkei 225 advanced 4.3 percent to 13,884.13 last
week, taking its year-to-date gain to 34 percent.  Measure Flipped  The yen-denominated Nikkei 225 would have closed lower
instead of higher in the week ended Feb. 15 if not for Fast
Retailing, Bloomberg data show. The measure’s 21 yen advance
would have become an 11 yen retreat without the clothier’s 32
yen contribution, the data show.  Nikkei Inc. is aware of the issues relating to Fast
Retailing’s weight in the measure, the company said in a faxed
response to questions. Fast Retailing declined to comment on the
stock’s role in the Nikkei 225, spokesman Keiji Furukawa said.  On days when listed options on the Nikkei 225 are settled,
Fast Retailing’s volume surges an average of 3.1 times compared
with the 30-day moving average, according to data for the last
year compiled by Bloomberg. On March 8, a settlement date for
listed options, the Nikkei 225 closed  above 12,000  for the first
time since September 2008. The clothier capped a 24 percent
advance that week as volume surged to the highest in two years.  Volume Increases  Trading volume in  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , the second-heaviest company
in the gauge at 4.5 percent, doubles versus the 30-day moving
average on those days, the data show. For the Nikkei 225 as a
whole, volume increases about 30 percent, while for  Sojitz
Corp. (2768) , the company with the smallest weighting, it rises just 10
percent on average.  The Nikkei 225 is a price-weighted stock average that’s
been calculated daily since 1950. Its  methodology  is based on
similar calculations to those underlying the 30-member  Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU) , according to compiler Nikkei Inc.  Japan’s alternative equity benchmark, the 1,698-company
Topix Index, uses market capitalization for  rankings , much like
the Standard & Poor’s 500 in the U.S. Toyota, the country’s
largest company by value, is the biggest at 4.6 percent. Fast
Retailing ranks No. 50 in the Topix.  “I tend to look at the Topix more than the Nikkei,” Chris Konstantinos, who helps oversee $3.65 billion as director of
international portfolio management at Riverfront Investment
Group LLC in Richmond,  Virginia , said in a phone interview on
April 23. “The more diversified a benchmark is, the more
relevant it is. It’s the same reason that the S&P 500 is a more
robust benchmark than the Dow Jones.”  Dow Distortion  At $194.31 a share on April 26,  International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM)  is the highest priced stock in the Dow,  making up 
10 percent of the gauge. In the S&P 500, the top 10 percent is
divided among the five largest U.S. companies by market value
and IBM isn’t one of them.  While the Nikkei 225 and the Dow may not reflect the whole
market, their compilers shouldn’t alter the methodology because
there’s a need to keep historic data consistent, Konstantinos
said. The Dow was developed in 1896, six decades before the S&P
500 began. The Topix began on Jan. 4, 1968.  “A big change in weighting renders the historical analysis
less relevant, less useful, and potentially biased,”
Konstantinos said.  Initial Weight  When Fast Retailing joined the Nikkei 225 on Aug. 26, 2005,
it had an initial weighting of 2.7 percent, the fourth-largest
at the time. The shares have risen more than fourfold since
then, with a commensurate expansion in its influence.  Fast Retailing’s valuation, at 39 times estimated earnings,
may also be distorted, according to Ichiro Takamatsu at Tokyo-
based Bayview Asset. The company trades for more than twice
global rival  The Gap Inc. (GPS) ’s 15 times.  Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) ,
operator of H&M stores, is priced at 21 times future earnings
and Spain’s  Inditex SA (ITX) , owner of the Zara brand, trades at 24
times.  The average of analysts’ price targets is 27,592 yen as of
April 29, 23 percent lower than where Fast Retailing closed
April 26. The current share price is ‘strange’ in light of its
earnings growth, Taketo Yamate, an analyst at Credit Suisse,
said in a report dated April 12.  “The Nikkei 225 is not functioning as an index reflecting
the overall market,” said Tatsushi Maeno, head of investment at
PineBridge, which manages about $11 billion globally. “The way
the index is calculated has to be changed.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
