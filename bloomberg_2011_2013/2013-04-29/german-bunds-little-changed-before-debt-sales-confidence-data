Italy ’s government bonds rose,
pushing 10-year yields toward the lowest level since October
2010, as the swearing-in of a new prime minister yesterday ended
nine weeks of political deadlock.  Two-year notes gained for a second day after Premier Enrico Letta said that he is committed to controlling public finances.
Italy sold bonds maturing in 2023 at the lowest auction yield
since October 2010. Spanish 10-year yields dropped to the lowest
since November 2010 as German finance minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said he would use a meeting with Spanish counterpart
Luis de Guindos to unveil a plan aimed at spurring investment in
Spanish companies. Benchmark German bunds were little changed.  “With a new government, Italy has removed a large chunk of
uncertainty and that should be positive for Italian bonds and
peripherals,” said Soeren Moerch, the head of fixed-income
trading at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “Now we have to see
if it can deliver reforms to growth.”  Italian 10-year yields dropped 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 3.92 percent at 4:41 p.m.  London  time after
falling to 3.89 percent on April 23, the lowest since Oct. 27,
2010. The 5.5 percent bond maturing in November 2022 rose 1.175,
or 11.75 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,310) face amount, to 112.77.  Two-year yields slid 14 basis points to 1.15 percent after
falling to 1.13 percent on April 23, the least on record.
 Spain (GSPG10YR) ’s 10-year yield declined 12 basis points to 4.16 percent
after reaching 4.15 percent, the lowest since Oct. 27, 2010.  Italy’s Coalition  In his first speech to Italy’s Chamber of Deputies as
premier, Letta vowed to suspend the collection of a disputed
property tax and review the levy in a bid to stimulate the
country’s shrinking economy. He faces confidence votes in both
houses of parliament to install his government.  Letta managed to assemble a coalition government by forging
an alliance last week with former premier  Silvio Berlusconi ,
whose support virtually guarantees the success of parliamentary
votes in the euro region’s third-biggest economy.  The nation has been in a political deadlock since
inconclusive elections on Feb. 24-25.  Italy sold 3 billion euros of 10-year bonds at an average
yield of 3.94 percent, with investors bidding for 1.42 times the
amount for sale. The nation last sold 10-year securities on
March 27 at 4.66 percent.  The Rome-based Treasury also allotted 3 billion euros of
notes maturing in 2018 at 2.84 percent, down from 3.65 percent
at last month’s auction.  German Inflation  Germany’s 10-year bund yielded 1.20 percent after touching
1.19 percent, the lowest since July 24, as a report showed the
inflation rate in the  Europe ’s largest economy slumped to the
lowest in more than 2 1/2 years in April.  Germany ’s annual inflation rate, calculated using a
 harmonized  European Union method, fell to 1.1 percent from 1.8
percent in March. That’s the lowest since August 2010.
Economists predicted a slowdown to 1.7 percent, according to the
median of 19 forecasts in a Bloomberg  survey .  Two-year note yields fell  below zero  for the first time
since April 18, meaning investors who hold the securities until
they mature will receive less than they paid for them.  A separate report confirmed  consumer confidence  in the euro
area increased this month. An index of household confidence in
the 17-nation euro bloc climbed to minus 22.3 from minus 23.5 in
March, according to data from the European Commission in
Brussels.  The  European Central Bank  will reduce its main  refinancing
rate  by 25 basis points to 0.5 percent at its meeting on May 2,
according the median estimate of 70 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said at the previous policy
meeting on April 4 that risks to the euro area’s economic
outlook remained on the downside.  ‘Direct Impact’  “You could argue how much of a direct impact a rate cut
would have,” said  Richard McGuire , a senior fixed-income
strategist at Rabobank International in London, talking on
Bloomberg Television’s “On the Move” with  Francine Lacqua .
“At the very least it would show the ECB is attempting to shore
up confidence as the slowdown in growth, which has clearly
affected the periphery, now seems to be leaking into the core.”  Belgium ’s 10-year bond yields were little changed at 1.98
percent after the nation sold an additional 1.1 billion euros of
the securities at a  record-low  auction yield of 1.971 percent
today. The Belgian Debt Agency also allotted 1 billion euros of
five-year notes at an all-time  auction low  of 0.821 percent.  The nation also sold government debt due in 2021 and 2028.  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Italy and  Finland , according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Italian bonds returned 3.7 percent this year through April
26, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish debt gained
7.4 percent, while German bonds earned 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
