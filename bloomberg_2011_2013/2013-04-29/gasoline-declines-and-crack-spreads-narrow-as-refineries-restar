Gasoline futures fell and crack
spreads narrowed as refineries in  Louisiana  and  California 
returned from planned and unplanned maintenance outages.  Futures retreated as much as 0.9 percent. The fuel’s
 premium  over June West Texas Intermediate declined $1.21 to
$24.54 a barrel, while the  spread  versus Brent narrowed 79 cents
to $14.79. Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Chalmette plant in Louisiana
completed maintenance on its fluid catalytic cracker, and
Chevron Corp. said last week it expects to bring the Richmond
site in California to full rates over the coming days.  “We are seeing refineries come back up from maintenance or
other issues in the past few weeks,” said Carl Larry, president
of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston. “We might be in
store for a few more weeks of middling gasoline prices until we
see a real pop in demand”  Gasoline for May delivery fell 1.98 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $2.8151 a gallon at 9:53 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange on volume that was 33 percent below the 100-day average
for the time of day.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, was unchanged at
$3.50 a gallon, AAA said on its website today.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for May delivery dropped 1.1 cents,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.8902 a gallon on the Nymex. Trading volume
was 42 percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus June West Texas Intermediate
crude fell 89 cents to $26.49 a barrel. The  spread  versus Brent
decreased 45 cents to $16.77.  To contact the reporter on this story:
