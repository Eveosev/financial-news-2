Serbia  is considering the purchase
of Russian-made MIG-29 combat aircraft and radars, Defense
Minister Aleksandar Vucic said.  “We are considering such a purchase for financial
reasons,” even as Serbia has “excellent relations” with NATO,
Vucic told reporters during a visit to neighboring Croatia.  The Blic newspaper reported last week that the Balkan
country may spend $150 million on six new jets to improve its
air defense.  To contact the reporter on this story:
