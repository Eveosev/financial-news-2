Latam Airlines SA,  Latin America ’s
largest carrier, dropped the most since August after its
chairman said the company plans to sell new shares as part of an
effort to recover the investment grade it lost last year.  Latam retreated 2.6 percent to 9,800 pesos at 1:31 p.m. in
Santiago, its biggest drop on a closing basis since Aug. 7. The
Ipsa benchmark index fell 0.5 percent.  The airline, formed by Lan Airlines SA’s $3.3 billion
takeover of Tam SA, will sell new shares to improve its debt
ratios and return to investment grade, Chairman Mauricio Amaro
told reporters today in Santiago after its annual general
shareholder meeting.  “Investment-grade is something that we will seek to return
to, if not in the short term, certainly in the medium term,”
Amaro said. “We are evaluating a capital increase at the
moment.” Amaro wouldn’t comment on a specific date for the
share sale or how much it plans to raise.  Latam’s credit rating was lowered to BB+, or one level
below investment grade, by  Fitch Ratings  in June 2012. Fitch
said that an increase in the rating would require a reduction in
debt ratios.  To contact the reporter on this story:
