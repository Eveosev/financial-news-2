Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the most
indebted miner of the precious metal, raised $3 billion in a
three-part bond offering to refinance debt as lower gold prices
reduce profitability.  Barrick sold $650 million of 2.5 percent, five-year year
notes to yield 185 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $1.5 billion of 4.1 percent, 10-year notes with a
relative yield of 245 basis points through its parent company,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Toronto-based firm
also issued $850 million of 5.75 percent, 30-year securities at
a 285 basis-point spread through its North America Finance
division. Proceeds from the sale will be used to help refinance
its $14.8 billion in total debt.  The miner last sold new bonds May 9, issuing $2 billion in
10- and 30-year maturities, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Its $1.25 billion in 3.85 percent notes due April
2022 traded at 100.2 cents on the dollar to yield 3.83 percent
April 26, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The securities had
traded as high as 107.9 cents on the dollar last year.  Standard & Poor’s  dropped its  credit rating  on the company
April 26 to BBB, the second-lowest investment grade, with a
negative outlook, citing the company’s intention to issue debt
and interruptions at a South American mine. Barrick was cut one
level by Moody’s Investors Service on April 24 to Baa2,
equivalent to S&P’s rating.  Higher production costs and falling gold prices have
lowered Barrick’s gross margin to 47.4 percent in 2012 from 56.2
percent a year earlier, Bloomberg  data  show. The company  burned 
through $930 million in 2012 and is expected by analysts in a
Bloomberg survey to consume $825 million more this year,
reversing free cash flow of $342 million in 2011. Gold has
fallen 22 percent since peaking at $1,900 an ounce in September
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
