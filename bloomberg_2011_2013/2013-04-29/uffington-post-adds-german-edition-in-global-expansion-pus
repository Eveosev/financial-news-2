The  Huffington Post , the news
website owned by AOL Inc., said it plans to start a German-
language edition as it seeks to continue its expansion outside
the home U.S. market.  The U.S.-based publication will work with Munich-based
digital media company  Tomorrow Focus AG (TFA)  to hire journalists and
will begin publishing this fall in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland, it said in a statement today.  “We are thrilled to be partnering with Tomorrow Focus to
launch the German edition of the Huffington Post,” Editor-In-
Chief Arianna Huffington said in the statement.  While The Huffington Post will provide news, blogging,
community and social engagement, Tomorrow Focus will contribute
editorial resources through Focus Online, according to the
statement.  The Huffington Post has 46.2 million unique visitors to the
U.S. site each month and more than 30,000 bloggers from
politicians and academics to students and policy experts. It has
editions outside the U.S. in the U.K.,  Canada , Quebec, France,
Spain and Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
