Kuwait may post a budget surplus of
as much as 15.2 billion dinars ($53.4 billion) in the fiscal
year that ended March 31, with spending possibly 10 percent to
20 percent below the forecast,  National Bank of Kuwait  said.  Kuwait’s 11-month provisional surplus of 18.8 billion
dinars is “thanks partly to an unusual underspend in the large
‘miscellaneous expenditures and transfers’ segment,” the
country’s biggest lender said in an e-mailed report today.
Kuwaiti crude averaged $107 a barrel in the 2012-2013 fiscal
year, NBK said.  Last year’s budget projected spending of 21.2 billion
dinars and revenue of 13.9 billion dinars. The government said
it will raise revenue allocations to its Future Generations Fund
wealth fund this fiscal year to 25 percent from 10 percent to
“encourage saving.”  An oil price of between $101 and $105 per barrel in the
current fiscal year “could generate a budget surplus for Kuwait
of between 8 billion and 12 billion dinars,” the bank said.  Kuwait, OPEC’s fourth-biggest producer, posted a record
budget surplus of 13.2 billion dinars in the 2011-2012 fiscal
year as oil prices and output rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
