Futures on the  Euro Stoxx 50 Index (SX5E) 
may advance for a second week after contracts for the gauge of
euro-area stocks formed a bullish price flip last week,
according to a technical analyst at BBSP SAS in Paris.  Euro Stoxx 50  futures  completed the bullish technical
indicator by closing at a higher price on April 26 than they did
at the end of trading four weeks earlier.  “This is a short-term signal of a switch in market
dynamics,” Jean-Charles Gand, a senior market strategist at the
brokerage, said in a telephone interview.  Contracts on the equity benchmark added 0.8 percent to
2,656 at 1:17 p.m. in  London  today. The Euro Stoxx 50 has
climbed 4 percent so far in April, its first monthly advance
since January, as companies reported better-than-expected
earnings and speculation mounted that the ECB will cut interest
rates. The central bank will lower its key rate to 0.5 percent
at a meeting on May 2, according to the  median estimate  in a
Bloomberg survey.  Gand said futures expiring in June may climb to 2,700 in
the next five days, implying a 2.5 percent increase from the
close on April 26. The strategist added that generic Euro Stoxx
50 futures may rally 29 percent to 3,400 in the next six to 12
months, or to 3,700 in a best-case scenario, which would
represent a 40 percent surge.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
