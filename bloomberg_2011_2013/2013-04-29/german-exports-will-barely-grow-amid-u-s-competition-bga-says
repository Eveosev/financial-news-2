German exports will barely grow
this year amid stronger competition from the U.S. and  China , the
BGA exporters’ lobby said.  German sales abroad will rise 3 percent, unadjusted for
inflation, to 1.13 trillion euros ($1.48 trillion) while imports
will increase 1 percent in nominal terms to 918.2 billion euros,
the BGA said today in an e-mailed statement.  “We shouldn’t underestimate the U.S., which faces an
economic comeback,” BGA president Anton Boerner said in the
statement. “They have the expertise, the personnel, raw
materials and cheap energy.”  German business confidence fell for a second month in April
and exports dropped more than economists forecast in February as
the euro area, the country’s biggest trading partner, struggled
to emerge from recession. European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said on April 19 that he hasn’t seen any improvement in
economic data in the area after hinting at the beginning of the
month he might cut  interest rates  if the recovery faltered.  “The global economic recovery is slow in coming and will
probably also be less dynamic than previously thought,” Boerner
said. “The strong growth in foreign trade, to which we had
become accustomed in recent years, is gone for now.”  With only moderate impetus from foreign trade, the German
economy will grow 0.8 percent at most this year, Boerner said.
While  Germany  is less affected by the euro region’s crisis than
its European competitors, its exports “stand on one leg” due
to the weakness of the rest of  Europe , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
