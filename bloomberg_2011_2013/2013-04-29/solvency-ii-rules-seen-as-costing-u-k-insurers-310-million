European rules aimed at making
insurers safer may cost the industry as much as 200 million
pounds ($310 million) a year in the U.K., said  Andrew Bailey ,
the country’s top banking and insurance supervisor.  The delayed rules, known as Solvency II, may see insurance
premiums increase by 0.1 percent to cover the cost of
compliance, Bailey, chief executive officer of the Prudential
Regulation Authority, said in a letter to  Andrew Tyrie , chairman
of the U.K.’s Treasury Select Committee, dated April 19 and
released by Tyrie today.  Bailey, a deputy governor of the  Bank of England  in London,
said the cost estimates, based on a no-delay scenario, were
“subject to substantial uncertainty” and to be used as a
“benchmark.”  Solvency II, intended to harmonize the way insurers
allocate capital against the risks they take across the 27-
member European Union, was originally scheduled to come into
force in 2013. The regulations may not be implemented before
2016, Gabriel Bernardino, chairman of the  European Insurance and
Occupational Pensions Authority , has said.  “Strengthening and harmonizing the prudential regulation
of the insurance sector across the EU could bring significant
benefits,” Tyrie said in an e-mailed statement on letters that
he and Bailey exchanged on the EU law. “But we haven’t seen any
yet. Even now no one can be sure what it will add.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
