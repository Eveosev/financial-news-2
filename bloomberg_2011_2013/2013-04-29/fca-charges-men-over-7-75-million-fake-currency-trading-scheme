The U.K. finance regulator charged
two men with setting up a fraudulent currency-trading scheme,
which robbed 5 million pounds ($7.75 million) from its
investors.  Alex Hope, from  London , and Raj Von Badlo, from
Buckinghamshire, north of the capital, were charged with 10
offenses linked to the scheme they promoted and operated, the
Financial Conduct Authority said in a press release posted on
its website today.  Both men were arrested following searches of their homes
carried out by the  City of London  Police and the then finance
regulator, Financial Services Authority. The FCA took over from
the FSA earlier this month.  A former U.K. foreign-exchange broker was sentenced to five
years in jail in March for defrauding investors of about 3
million pounds.  Chris Hamilton , a spokesman for the regulator, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking details of the mens’
lawyers and contact details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
