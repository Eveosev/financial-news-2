Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , the
operator of Colombia’s largest oil field, gained the most in
three weeks after saying it plans to buy back as much as 10
percent of outstanding shares not held by company insiders.  The shares rallied 3 percent to 38,280 pesos at 8:55 a.m.
in Bogota after gaining 4.1 percent in the biggest intraday
advance since April 9. Rubiales was the best performer on
Colombia’s Colcap index, which dropped 0.6 percent.  Rubiales intends to start buying back as many as 31.1
million shares as the stock “may be undervalued from time to
time in relation to its current and future business prospects,”
according to a statement today. Some of the purchased shares may
be held as an investment by the company’s pension fund,
according to the statement.  The bid must be accepted by the Toronto Stock Exchange,
where shares are also listed. The offering is scheduled to start
on May 1 and may remain open until the end of April 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
