West Texas Intermediate crude
advanced to near its highest closing level in more than two
weeks. OPEC’s reference price rebounded above $100 a barrel.  WTI reversed losses of 0.6 percent as European stocks and
the euro rose amid speculation central banks will maintain
monetary stimulus.  Brent crude  traded near its highest closing
price in two weeks as Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta
prepared to finish installing a new government. Hedge funds
curbed bullish bets on the North Sea benchmark to their lowest
in four months, data from ICE Futures Europe showed.  “We do expect oil demand to pick up in the months ahead,”
said Michael Poulsen, an analyst at Global Risk Management in
Middlefart,  Denmark . Brent “prices should be fundamentally
supported around the three-digit mark,” he said.  WTI for June delivery climbed as much as 46 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $93.46 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , and traded for $93.27 as of 12:46 p.m.
 London  time. It settled at $93.64 on April 25, the highest
closing level since April 10. The volume of all contracts traded
was 1 percent below the 100-day average.  Brent for June settlement declined as much as 59 cents to
$102.57 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, and was at $103.11. The front-month contract was at a
premium of $9.77 to WTI compared with $10.16 on April 26.  ‘Economic Risk’  Morgan Stanley is “skeptical” that the spread between WTI
and Brent can fall on a sustained basis, the bank said in a
report e-mailed today. Any significant narrowing would be a
selling opportunity as differentials will probably widen again
throughout the year, it said.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index added 0.2 percent as of 12:50
p.m. in London, extending its biggest weekly increase in five
months. The euro strengthened 0.4 percent to 1.3076 per dollar.
Italy’s new leader will address Parliament at 3 p.m. local time,
followed by a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies needed
to install the government.  The  basket of 12 crude grades  used as a reference by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries also rose above
$100 for the first time since April 12. The basket was at
$100.70 on April 26, according to an e-mail today from the
group’s Vienna-based secretariat.  Brent at $100 a barrel “is more reasonable, looking at the
fundamentals,” Robin Mills, the head of consulting at Dubai-
based Manaar Energy Consulting and Project Management, said
yesterday. “Some of the geopolitical risk has come off and the
economic risk is to the downside for prices.”  Technical Trend  Net-long positions  in WTI crude held by money managers,
including  hedge funds , commodity pools and commodity-trading
advisers, dropped in the week ended April 23, according to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s April 26 Commitments of
Traders report. They fell by 624 futures and options combined to
182,408, the CFTC report showed.  Hedge funds and other money managers cut  bullish bets  on
Brent crude to their lowest level in four months for a third
consecutive week, according to data from ICE Futures Europe.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 99,127 lots in
the week ended April 23, ICE said in its weekly Commitment of
Traders report. The drop of 8,973 contracts, or 8.3 percent
leaves so-called net-longs at their lowest since Dec. 11.  WTI may extend losses as an indicator of technical momentum
falters. The 50-day moving average, at $92.65 a barrel today,
has dropped below the 100-day moving average for the first time
in three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Investors typically sell contracts on a “death cross,” when a
moving average falls below a longer-term one. The 50-day average
is about 84 cents above the 200-day mean, the smallest premium
since February.  Angola ,  Africa ’s second-largest oil producer, plans to cut
crude exports to 51 cargoes, or 1.63 million barrels a day, in
June, which is the lowest in nine months, according to a final
loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
