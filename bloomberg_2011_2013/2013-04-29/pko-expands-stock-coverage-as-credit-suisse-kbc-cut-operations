PKO Bank Polski SA,  Poland ’s
biggest bank, will expand its stock research to cover companies
outside its home market as foreign competitors are scaling down
operations in central Europe’s largest economy.  PKO’s brokerage is looking for an analyst to cover the
biggest stocks in  Austria , the Czech Republic and Hungary,
Managing Director Grzegorz Zawada said at a news conference in
Warsaw today. The fourth-largest broker on the  Warsaw Stock
Exchange , which has eight equity analysts, will increase
coverage to about 60 companies this year from about 40.  “It’s a good time to strengthen our position while our
rivals get weaker,” Zawada said. “We want to sell knowledge
and to become a regional brokerage house.”  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  moved its Polish equity trading to
 London  from Warsaw while KBC Securities NV’s Polish branch
halted its retail brokerage, institutional sales, market making,
research and corporate finance this month after turnover on the
country’s stock exchange slumped.  Stock trading volumes slumped 24 percent to 202.9 billion
zloty ($64 billion) in Warsaw last year amid Europe’s financial
crisis and slowing economic growth in Poland.  The Warsaw exchange is central Europe’s biggest equity
market, listing 438 companies on its main market with a combined
value of 698 billion zloty.  PKO shares gained less than 0.1 percent to 32.73 zloty at
1:33 p.m. in Warsaw, trimming this year’s drop to 11 percent.
The Polish government is the bank’s biggest shareholder with a
31 percent stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
