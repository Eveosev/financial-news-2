Spot gasoline in  San Francisco 
tumbled to the lowest level in more than two weeks as  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  started the crude unit at the Richmond refinery, the
largest in Northern  California .  The 240,000-barrel-a-day  Richmond plant  was feeding oil
into its only crude unit, shut after a fire Aug. 6, last week
and expected to increase production from other equipment in
“the coming days,” Jeff Gustavson, Chevron’s general manager
of  investor relations , said in an quarterly earnings conference
call April 26.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco
dropped 13 cents to a premium of 9.5 cents a gallon against
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:16 p.m.
New York time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
the lowest level for the fuel in the Bay since April 10.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s 165,000-barrel-a-day Martinez
refinery near San Francisco was also starting units after
finishing a maintenance turnaround, an April 25 notice filed
with Contra Costa County regulators showed. The plant shut units
in the light-oil processing section earlier this month for
planned repairs, a person familiar with the work said April 8.  Carbob  in Los Angeles  dropped 5.5 cents to a premium of 5
cents a gallon over Nymex futures, a three-week low.  El Segundo  The 279,000-barrel-a-day El Segundo refinery, the largest
in California, has resumed normal rates after a maintenance
turnaround, Pat Yarrington, Chevron’s chief financial officer,
said in the earnings call April 26.  San Francisco’s  premium  to Los Angeles narrowed 7.5 cents
to 4.5 cents a gallon, the smallest spread in three days.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in  Los Angeles  weakened
1.5 cents to a discount of 2.75 cents a gallon against ultra-
low-sulfur diesel futures on the Nymex, the lowest level since
Dec. 14. CARB diesel in San Francisco dropped 1.75 cents to 5.75
cents a gallon below futures, a three-month low.  Conventional gasoline  in  Portland ,  Oregon , jumped 4 cents
to 15 cents a gallon over Nymex futures, a two-month high. Low-
sulfur diesel  there  gained 1.75 cents against ULSD futures to a
premium of 2.5 cents a gallon.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles narrowed a second
day, shrinking $3.39 to $13.80 a barrel at 4:17 p.m.  New York 
time. The spread, a rough indicator of refinery margins, is down
53 percent from this year’s high of $29.09 a barrel on Feb. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
