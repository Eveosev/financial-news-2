Lumber futures fell the most in
more than a week, capping the longest stretch of declines since
1999, as unseasonably cold and wet weather hampers home building
in much on the U.S.  Through April 27, 2,949 daily precipitation records were
set or tied in the U.S., which was 438 more than all of April
2012, according to the  National Climatic Data Center  in
Asheville, North Carolina. During the same period, 3,368 daily
low-temperature records were set or tied in the U.S., compared
to 531 in April 2012, according to the  data center . Lumber
futures have tumbled 15 percent since reaching an eight-year
high in March.  “The spring weather has delayed some new construction by a
few weeks,”  Paul Quinn , a Vancouver-based analyst at  RBC
Capital Markets , said in a telephone interview. “There are also
signs that we’re seeing a production response to higher lumber
prices, so there may be more lumber coming.”  Lumber futures for delivery in July declined 1 percent to
settle at $351.80 per 1,000 board feet on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the biggest drop since April 17. Prices have fallen
for nine straight sessions, the longest run since Sept. 29,
1999.  Price surged 44 percent in 2012 and 4.3 percent last
quarter amid increased U.S. construction and demand from China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
