The shekel appreciated to an 18-
month high, prompting bets the Bank of  Israel  will purchase
dollars for the second time this month to weaken the currency
and support the country’s export-driven economy.  The shekel advanced 0.7 percent to 3.5799 a dollar, the
strongest since October 2011, at 5 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The central
bank bought U.S. dollars on April 8 for the first time in almost
two years after the shekel rose to as much as 3.5898 a dollar.
The currency has appreciated 4.3 percent this year, making it
the second-best performer after the Mexican peso among a basket
of 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Israel’s base lending rate at 1.75 percent isn’t low enough
to stop capital inflow affecting the shekel exchange rate, Bank
of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer said in  Jerusalem  today. The
currency’s appreciation has also been driven by the start of
domestic natural gas production and on prospects the government
will take long-term steps to boost economic growth.  “The shekel is hovering below the 3.60 level, testing the
levels at which the central bank is again likely to intervene,”
Rony Gitlin, head of spot trading at Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd.
in Tel Aviv, said by phone. “The central bank may need to
increase the amount of dollar purchases to have an impact on
weakening the currency.”  The Bank of Israel has gradually reduced the borrowing rate
from 3.25 percent in 2011 in an effort to shore up the economy
amid the  European debt crisis . The gap between Israel’s
benchmark interest rate and those in major economies is also
spurring investment in the country’s bonds, Fischer said on
April 23. The next base rate announcement is on May 27.  Living Costs  The yield on the benchmark’s 4.25 percent bonds due in
March 2023 slumped eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point,
to 3.55 percent, the lowest on record at the close in Tel Aviv,
after demand for the securities rose at a debt sale today.
Investors sought 6.6 times the 250 million shekels ($70 million)
on sale, up from 6.3 times at the last sale on April 22,
according to ministry data posted on Bloomberg.  The Israeli cabinet yesterday approved steps to bring down
car prices by at least 20 percent to increase competition in
imports and sales of new and used cars. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday the government is taking steps to
reduce the cost of living “on land, sea and air.”  Fitch reaffirmed Israel’s A rating on April 25, saying the
start of gas production will boost economic growth to 3.7
percent this year from 3.2 percent in 2012.  One-year interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, dropped four basis
points, the most since April 19, to 1.57 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
