Heath Hall, co-founder of Pork 
Barrel BBQ, explains how he and Brett Thompson, both former 
Senate staffers, got the idea to start their food company while 
discussing late night food options on Capitol Hill, and went on 
to appear on the TV reality show "Shark Tank" where investor 
Barbara Corcoran committed to a $50,000 infusing of financing. 
Hall speaks with Bloomberg's  Kathleen Hays  and Vonnie Quinn on 
Bloomberg Radio's "The Hays Advantage."   (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 10:49
