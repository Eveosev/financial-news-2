Swedish retail sales growth slowed
last month as shoppers reduced spending amid rising unemployment
in the biggest Nordic economy.  Sales growth  slowed to an annual 1.8 percent in March from
a revised 3.4 percent the previous month, Stockholm-based
 Statistics Sweden  said today. Sales were estimated to grow 2.3
percent, according to the  median estimate  in a Bloomberg survey. 
Monthly retail sales  fell 0.4 percent.  Swedish companies are cutting jobs to cope with weak demand
from abroad. The central bank this month pushed back plans for
its first  interest rate  increase to late 2014 as rising
unemployment damps inflation by making it harder for companies
to pass on cost increases to consumers.  The Riksbank cut its  repo  rate four times since December
2011 to 1 percent before keeping rates unchanged in two
consecutive meetings in an attempt to revive flagging economic
growth without stoking an asset-price bubble. The  export -reliant
Nordic country suffers from weak European demand as countries
cut spending to reduce debt. Sweden exports about half of its
output, and about 70 percent of sales take place in  Europe .  Unemployment in the $500 billion economy unexpectedly rose
to 8.8 percent in March after companies including Ericsson AB,
the worldâ€™s largest maker of mobile networks, cut jobs. It will
rise to an average 8.2 percent this year from 8 percent in 2012
after  economic growth  slowed to 0.8 percent last year from 3.7
percent in 2011, the Riksbank said on April 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
