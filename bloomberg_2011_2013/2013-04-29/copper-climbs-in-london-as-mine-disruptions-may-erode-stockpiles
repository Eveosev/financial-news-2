Copper advanced in London on
speculation mining disruptions will erode oversupply.  Stockpiles in warehouses monitored by the London Metal
Exchange fell 0.3 percent in today’s warehouse report by the
exchange, and last week had the smallest weekly increase in two
months. Copper has dropped 11 percent this year as increased
production led to the biggest since 2003. The International
Copper Study Group, a government-industry group, last week said
copper will have oversupply of 417,000 metric tons this year.  “I wouldn’t be surprised if the market in several months
is disputing whether the oversupply will be achieved at all,”
said  Eugen Weinberg , head of commodities research at Commerzbank
AG in  Frankfurt . “Oversupply is pretty much priced in.”  Copper for delivery in three months rose 1.4 percent to
$7,125 a ton by 12:19 p.m. on the LME. Futures for delivery in
July climbed 1.3 percent to $3.227 a pound on the Comex in  New
York .  Pan Pacific Copper Co., Japan’s biggest producer of the
metal, cut its forecast for excess global supply this year to
13,000 tons from 199,000 tons in January, citing output
reductions by smelters in India and the U.S.  Nickel advanced 0.7 percent to $15,315 a ton. As much as 40
percent of the global nickel industry may be losing money,
Macquarie Group Ltd. said in a report dated today, citing a
research company’s estimate. Nickel prices have dropped 11
percent this year.  “Closures will take a little longer to be implemented than
some suspect,” Colin Hamilton, an analyst at the bank, said in
the report, citing costs from workforce losses, market share and
environmental clean-up.  U.S. economic growth probably weakened in the second
quarter, to 1.2 percent annualized, Macquarie said. The LME
index of six industrial metals dropped 2.3 percent on April 26
after U.S. gross domestic product grew 2.5 percent for the first
quarter, while 3 percent was the median forecast of economist
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
