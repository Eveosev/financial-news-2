Peru ’s sol touched the lowest level
in 10 months after President Ollanta Humala said the government
may buy shares in  Repsol SA (REP) ’s local unit, fueling concern he
plans to increase state control of the economy.  The sol fell as much as 0.7 percent to 2.6560 per  U.S.
dollar , the lowest intraday level since June 28, according to
prices from Datatec. It closed little changed at 2.6370.  The currency weakened today after Humala said in a TV
interview that Peru is considering buying a minority stake in
Refineria La Pampilla SA, operator of a refinery that was bought
by Repsol during government asset sales in the 1990s.  “Foreigners are not happy about all this” and may be
cutting back their sol holdings,  Pedro Tuesta , a Washington-
based Latin America economist at 4Cast Inc., said in a phone
interview. “It’s a show of no confidence. Peru has been lauded
for growing without any government intervention.”  Finance Minister Miguel Castilla told the state news agency
Andina that he hadn’t resigned after the Lima-based Expreso
newspaper said he may have quit in protest over the government’s
plan to purchase Repsol’s assets. Randa Mussallam, a spokeswoman
at the president’s office, didn’t return a phone call and an e-
mailed message seeking comment.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark sol bond maturing in August
2020 was little changed at 3.74 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price declined 0.01 centimo to 125.80
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
