Air pollutants in the Pearl River
Delta region, home to  China ’s manufacturing hub, were cut last
year on emission control measures and favorable weather
conditions, according to a government report.  The annual concentration levels of sulphur dioxide,
nitrogen dioxide, ozone and suspended particulates fell from 5
percent to 25 percent in 2012 from the year before, according to
a  report  by the environment departments from  Hong Kong  and
China’s Guangdong province.  Emissions from Chinese factories in the region, which
encompasses Shenzhen and Guangzhou, have choked residents and
put pressure on the Hong Kong government to strengthen efforts
to clean up the city’s air. While most pollutant levels have
dropped from 2006, the level of ozone in the region was up  12.5
percent, the report showed.  “The photochemical smog pollution in the region has not
yet improved,” the environmental departments said. “The
Guangdong and Hong Kong governments will continue to implement
emission reduction measures to further improve the  air quality 
in the region.”  The former British colony recorded more than twice as many
hours of very high roadside pollution in the first quarter
compared with the year before. The Environmental Protection
Department earlier this month attributed the increase to the
comparative abundance of bright sunshine, which it explained was
conducive to smog formation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
