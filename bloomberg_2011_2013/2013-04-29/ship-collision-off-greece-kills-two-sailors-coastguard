Two Syrian sailors were killed and
another eight are missing after a cargo ship carrying fertilizer
collided with a container vessel early today off southwestern
 Greece .  The Cook Islands-flagged Pirireis cargo ship sank after
colliding with the Antigua and Bermuda-flagged container vessel
Consouth at about
6 a.m. local time, according to a Greek  Coastguard  spokeswoman,
who declined to be named citing departmental policy. The cause
of the accident is not yet known.  The dead and missing sailors were part of a 17-member crew
on the Pirireis, which was sailing from  Algeria  to  Ukraine . The
Consouth was sailing without cargo from Turkey to Malta and had
a 16-man crew comprising 10 Poles, five Russians and one
Filipino, none of whom was hurt, the Coastguard spokeswoman
said.  Greek Coastguard vessels, a Navy helicopter, an Air Force
plane and five commercial ships that were in the area near
Sapienza Island are carrying out a search and rescue operation
for the missing seamen, the Coastguard said.  While the Pirireis was formerly a Turkish ship, it has
since been sold to an Arab sheik, a spokesman for  Turkey â€™s
Transportation, Maritime and Communication Ministry said today
by phone. The Consouth is owned by Germany-based Reederei Erwin
Strahlmann, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
