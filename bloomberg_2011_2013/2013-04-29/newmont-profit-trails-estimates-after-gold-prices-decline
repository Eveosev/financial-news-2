Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the biggest
U.S. gold producer, reported first-quarter earnings that missed
analysts’ estimates after gold prices declined and costs were
higher than expected.  Net income fell to $315 million, or 63 cents a share, from
$490 million, or 97 cents, a year earlier,  Greenwood Village ,
Colorado-based Newmont said yesterday in a statement. Earnings
excluding one-time items were 71 cents a share, trailing the 76-
cent average of 16  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell
to $2.18 billion from $2.68 billion, lagging behind the $2.29
billion average of seven estimates.  Newmont fell 5.8 percent to $31.99 at 10 a.m. in New York.  Chief Executive Officer Gary Goldberg is trying to curb
gold-mine operating costs that surged 40 percent between 2010
and last year amid rising prices for raw materials, equipment
and labor. While the gold industry tries to tackle cost
inflation, the commodity has slipped into a  bear market . Newmont
also saw an 11 percent decline in gold output in the quarter.  Newmont, which operates mines in countries including the
U.S.,  Indonesia  and  Australia , said April 24 its gold-linked
quarterly dividend dropped to 35 cents a share from 42.5 cents.  The company’s so-called average consolidated costs
applicable to sales in the quarter were $758 an ounce of gold,
compared with $620 a year earlier. The average of three
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for $740 an ounce.
So-called all-in sustaining costs, a new metric introduced by
gold producers, were $1,115 per ounce on an attributable basis,
6.6 percent higher than a year earlier, Newmont said.  Forecast Cut  The company on April 17 reported preliminary first-quarter
output of 1.17 million ounces of gold and 38 million pounds of
copper. It said at the time it was reviewing options to improve
 cash flow  and preserve financial flexibility “in light of the
prevailing volatile metal price environment.”  Newmont cut its forecast for 2013  capital expenditures  by
$100 million to a range of $2 billion to $2.2 billion.  The company reiterated forecasts for 2013 output of 4.8
million to 5.1 million ounces of gold and 150 million to 170
million pounds of copper.  The company expects to start production later this year at
its Akyem mine in  Ghana , Goldberg said in the statement.  Gold, which has risen for 12 consecutive years, fell into a
bear market April 12 after falling more than 20 percent from a
record closing price of $1,891.90 an ounce in August 2011. The
metal reached a two-year intraday low of $1,321.50 on April 16,
a day after plunging the most in three decades.  The metal averaged $1,631.89 in the first quarter, 3.7
percent less than a year earlier.  (Newmont scheduled a conference call for 10 a.m.  New York
