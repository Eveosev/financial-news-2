European stocks  rose, pushing the
Stoxx  Europe  600 Index toward its longest streak of monthly
gains since 1997, as  Italy  formed a new government and as U.S.
consumer spending unexpectedly increased in March.  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc surged to its highest price
in 12 years after increasing its dividend. Swedish Match AB
jumped the most since January 2009 after posting first-quarter
profit that beat estimates. Balfour Beatty Plc dropped to the
lowest price in 17 months after lowering its full-year profit
forecast.  The Stoxx 600 advanced 0.5 percent to 297.39, its highest
level since April 2. The benchmark gauge has climbed 1.2 percent
in April, its 11th month of gains, as investors bet the region’s
central bank will cut rates and as companies reported better-
than-expected results.  “What Europe really needs is growth, and anything that
helps that growth narrative is a good thing,” Adrian Bignell, a
fund manager at Invesco U.K. Ltd., said in an interview with
 Mark Barton  and Anna Edwards on Bloomberg Television. “The
jigsaw is slowly coming together in Europe. Nothing is
particularly beautiful, but somehow we seem to muddle through.
The Italian government being formed this weekend is a good case
in point for one more piece coming into the jigsaw.”  National benchmark indexes advanced in 15 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.5 percent  and was
poised for the longest streak of monthly gains since 1984.
 France ’s CAC 40 jumped 1.5 percent, while  Germany ’s DAX rose 0.8
percent. Italy’s FTSE MIB  rallied  2.2 percent to the highest
level since Feb. 1.  New Government  In Italy, Enrico Letta was sworn in as prime minister
yesterday, ending political uncertainty after February’s
inconclusive elections. Letta formed an alliance with  Silvio
Berlusconi , who has pledged to undo some parts of previous
premier  Mario Monti ’s budget-cutting measures.  Italy’s 10-year borrowing costs declined to a 2 1/2-year
low at an auction today.  Stocks extended gains as a Commerce Department report
showed that U.S. household purchases climbed 0.2 percent in
March, following a 0.7 percent gain a month earlier. Economists
on average had called for spending to be little changed.  The  European Central Bank  will lower its  interest rate  at a
meeting on May 2, according to economists in a Bloomberg survey.
The  Bank of England  will keep its interest rate unchanged at a
policy meeting next week, a separate survey showed.  In the U.S., the  Federal Reserve  starts a two-day policy
meeting tomorrow after data last week showed the world’s largest
economy expanded less than forecast.  Aberdeen Profit  Aberdeen rose 8 percent to 450.5 pence, its highest price
since January 2001, after  Scotland ’s biggest  fund manager 
reported first-half adjusted pretax profit of 222.8 million
pounds ($345 million), surpassing the average analyst projection
of 211 million pounds. The company raised its dividend to 6
pence a share.  Swedish Match advanced 6.7 percent to 221.90 kronor as the
snuffmaker posted first-quarter net income of 740 million kronor
($113 million), exceeding the 677 million-kronor estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Mediaset SpA, owned by Berlusconi, was among the biggest
gainers in Italy today, rising 4.7 percent to 1.97 euros. Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA added 2.7 percent to 1.39 euros. UniCredit SpA,
Italy’s biggest lender, gained 2.5 percent to 4.02 euros.  Ageas Payout  Ageas climbed 4.8 percent to 27.75 euros. The majority

asset portfolio and 144 million euros from the sale of a  call
option  on BNP Paribas SA’s shares.  Pohjola Bank Plc rose 5.3 percent to 13.34 euros, the
highest price since at least 1992, as the Finnish lender said it
expects higher consolidated pretax profit in 2013 compared with
last year. First-quarter net income rose to 100 million euros,
from 80 million euros a year earlier.  Volkswagen AG gained 2.6 percent to 152 euros after
reiterating that 2013 operating profit will match the 1.14
billion euros posted last year. The Porsche brand, which was
integrated into the company in August, offset a profit drop at
its Audi division as it generated 24 percent of total earnings,
according to a statement.  Balfour Beatty tumbled 9.5 percent to 222.9 pence, its
