The European Central Bank is likely
to cut its benchmark rate in the coming week to keep the
recovery it forecasts for later this year on track. The U.S.
Federal Reserve will probably vote to continue its record bond-
buying program.  U.S. employment is likely to have jumped in April as
companies looked beyond the impact of government budget cuts.  Warren Buffett  will answer questions from his shareholders
at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in Omaha,
Nebraska.  Facebook Inc. (FB) ,  General Motors Co. (GM) , Deutsche Bank AG, BP Plc
and Softbank Corp. will be among companies releasing results.  At Churchill Downs, the 139th Kentucky Derby will be run,
and racehorse Verrazano is the early favorite.  MONDAY, APRIL 29  To contact the reporters on this story:
