A Mars Inc. Wrigley chewing gum
with added caffeine has sparked U.S. regulators to review how
food with the added stimulant affects children.  The introduction today of Alert Energy gum is the latest in
a line of foods that have added caffeine,  Michael Taylor , the
Food and Drug Admnistration’s deputy commissioner for foods and
veterinary medicine, said in a  statement  on the agency’s
website. The only time the FDA approved added caffeine in food
was for cola in the 1950s he said.  “Today, the environment has changed,” Taylor said.
“Children and adolescents may be exposed to caffeine beyond
those foods in which caffeine is naturally found and beyond
anything FDA envisioned when it made the determination regarding
caffeine in cola.”  Alert Energy contains 40 milligrams of caffeine in each
piece, which is equivalent to half a cup of coffee. The gum is
marketed to adults 25 and older, Wrigley, a Chicago-based unit
of closely held candy maker Mars, said in a statement. The
company said it welcomes the opportunity to work with the FDA on
the topic.  The FDA said last year it was investigating caffeinated
energy drinks such as those made by  Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST)  and
Living Essentials LLC that have been linked to deaths and
dangerous side effects. U.S. Senators  Richard Durbin , an
Illinois Democrat, and  Richard Blumenthal , a Democrat from
 Connecticut , urged the agency in December to convene an expert
panel this year to discuss the effects of consumers’ caffeine
consumption. Durbin began pushing the FDA almost a year ago to
more strictly regulate energy drinks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
