The slump in silver this month has
spurred demand for products from Silver Bullion Pte, one of
Singapore’s largest suppliers of coins and bars to retail
investors, depleting inventories and doubling delivery times.  Holdings of bars fell to just 54 ounces from 60,000 ounces
two and a half weeks ago, according to founder Gregor Gregersen.
It now takes at least six weeks for new supplies to arrive in
the country up from two to three weeks previously, he said. The
company, set up in 2009, counts the Perth Mint in  Australia  and
the Royal Canadian Mint among its suppliers.  Gregersen’s comments add to signs from across  Asia  that the
plunge in silver, as well as gold, has triggered higher demand
from physical buyers who see an opportunity to expand holdings.
While silver has led declines in commodities this year, losing
20 percent in  New York , the amount held in exchange-traded
products worldwide remains 2.3 percent higher in 2013. The metal
is used both as an investment as well as by industry.  “For many leveraged paper owners, this price fall was a
disaster, for most physical bullion owners it was a buying
opportunity,” Gregersen said. A batch of 23,000 ounces is
expected to be delivered tomorrow, with almost all destined for
existing customers who pre-ordered, he said.  Demand for Maple Leaf gold and silver coins is very strong,
and has increased in Asia,  Europe  and  North America , said Chris
Carkner, managing director of sales for bullion, refinery and
ETPs at the Ottawa-based Royal Canadian Mint. The facility
continues to supply all its customers, he said.  ‘Ramping Up’  “The Perth Mint is meeting the surge in demand for
physical silver and gold by ramping up productivity as quickly
as possible to ensure lead times are kept to an absolute
minimum,” Ron Currie, sales and marketing director, said in an
e-mailed response to questions.  Futures tumbled to $22 an ounce on April 16, the lowest
since October 2010. The contract for delivery in July traded at
$24.245 an ounce on Comex at 5:28 p.m. in Singapore after rising
2.5 percent. Prices peaked at $49.845 in April 2011.  High price swings may deter so-called bargain hunters,
 Peter Richardson  and Joel Crane, Melbourne-based analysts at
Morgan Stanley, said in an April 23 report, cutting this year’s
silver forecast 19 percent to $27.17. Silver’s thirty-day
volatility rose to 46.66 today, the highest since January 2012.  ‘Scares Investors’  “Too high volatility usually scares investors away,”
Steven Dooley, head of research at brokerage Forex Capital
Trading Pty in  Melbourne , said by phone today. Prices may test
the low of $22 over the next 12 months as prospects for new U.S.
monetary stimulus are low, while slower-than-expected economic
expansion in  China  may hurt demand, he said.  Holdings in silver-backed ETPs stood at 19,353.38 tons on
April 26, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While that’s
1.6 percent lower this month, it compares with 18,916.92 tons at
the end of 2012.  The plunge in prices wasn’t foreseen by some investors. A
Bloomberg survey of 49 analysts published in December showed
that the metal was expected to rally to as much as $40.25 an
ounce, according to the median high figure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
