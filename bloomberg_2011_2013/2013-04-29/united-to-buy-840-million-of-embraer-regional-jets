Embraer SA (EMBR3)  will sell 30 regional
jets valued at about $840 million to  United Continental Holdings
Inc. (UAL)  as the world’s largest airline uses a new pilot contract
allowing commuter partners to fly bigger aircraft.  Deliveries of the 76-seat E-175 jets from  Sao Jose dos
Campos , Brazil-based Embraer will begin in 2014, and existing
50-seat aircraft will be replaced, according to United. Embraer
said yesterday that the Chicago-based carrier has options for 40
more of the planes.  “We are delighted to reinforce and extend our long-
standing partnership with United,” Embraer said in a statement.
Continental Airlines Inc., one of the carriers that merged to
form United Continental in 2010, was the initial customer for
Embraer’s ERJ 145 in 1996 and eventually built a fleet of 275
ERJs, the world’s largest, the planemaker said.  United is taking advantage of changes in the so-called
scope clause of the labor agreement reached with pilots in 2012.
Those terms specify the maximum size of planes that can be flown
by pilots at lower-paying regional airlines, which helps reduce
labor costs at major carriers such as United.  New Embraer 175s have an average book value of about $28
million apiece, according to Chantilly, Virginia-based
consultant Avitas. Recent sales have averaged about $26 million,
based on data compiled by Doug Rothacker, a Bloomberg Industries
analyst in Skillman,  New Jersey . United didn’t disclose a price.  Embraer gave an estimated value of $2.9 billion at list
prices for the firm orders and options. Airlines buying multiple
planes typically receive a discount to list prices, which at
Embraer’s figure are about $41 million each for the E-175s.  United joins peers in getting rid of their smallest jets.
 Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  ordered 40  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  CRJ900 76-
seaters in December as it retires 50-seaters, and  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s
American Eagle reached a deal in January for  Republic Airways
Holdings Inc. (RJET)  to operate 53 Embraer 76-seaters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
