Barry Sternlicht , chairman and
chief executive officer of  Starwood Capital  Group LLC, said he
plans to more than triple the firm’s investments in Europe as
returns on real estate on the continent are among the highest.  “There is liquidity in Europe,” Sternlicht said today at
the  Milken Institute Global Conference  in Beverly Hills,
California. “Debt is coming in unbelievably fast as the world
is searching for yield, and now one of the last remaining places
for that on Earth is Europe.”  Starwood Capital’s last private fund had about 6 percent of
its investments in Europe, and its latest one is poised to have
more, Sternlicht said at the conference. The Greenwich,
Connecticut-based firm said earlier this month that it raised
$4.2 billion for its new fund, with almost $2 billion of equity
capital already committed or invested in the U.S. and  Europe .  The possibility for social unrest in many European
countries struggling with economic downturns may pose a threat
to investments on the continent, Sternlicht said. About 80
percent of the new fund is investing in the U.S., which is
offering stable returns, he said.  Sternlicht founded Starwood Capital in 1991 after working
for Chicago-based JMB Realty Corp. He started  Starwood Hotels (HOT)  &
Resorts Worldwide Inc. in 1995, and ran the company until 2004,
when he stepped down as CEO to become executive chairman. He
resigned in 2005 amid a dispute with the board. Starwood Hotels,
based in Stamford, Connecticut, is no longer affiliated with
Starwood Capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
