Two cases of Chateau Lynch Bages
2000, a fifth-growth Pauillac wine estate, sold for 1,680 pounds
($2,600) each on  London ’s Liv-ex wine exchange today, a two-
month low and 7 percent below its 2013 peak, Liv-ex data showed.  The vintage fetched as much as 2,140 pounds a case on
Liv-ex in June 2011 as demand for Bordeaux wines was peaking,
and dropped as low as 1,500 pounds in January after investor
appetite cooled, particularly from  Asia . The 2000 vintage is
the most expensive Lynch Bages in merchant listings since its
1990 wine, according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.
