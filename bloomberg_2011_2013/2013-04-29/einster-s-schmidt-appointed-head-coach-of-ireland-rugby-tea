Leinster’s Joe Schmidt has been
appointed head coach of Ireland’s international rugby team, the
Irish Rugby Football Union said  on its website .  He succeeds Declan Kidney, who was fired earlier this month
after his team flopped in the Six Nations tournament. Kidney had
been in the post since May 2008.  New Zealander Schmidt led Leinster to Heineken Cup titles
in 2011 and 2012. Two days ago the club reached the final of
 Europe ’s second-tier Amlin Challenge Cup with a 44-16 victory
over defending champion Biarritz.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
