Equatorial Guinea plans to keep
exports of its Aseng crude unchanged at two cargoes in June, a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News shows.  One of the consignments is 950,000 barrels and the other is
650,000 barrels, according to the plan. The country will also
ship three consignments of its Zafiro blend and two of Ceiba,
earlier schedules showed.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
