The pound strengthened to a 10-week
high against the dollar as an industry report showed U.K.  house
prices  increased this month, boosting optimism the recovery is
gathering momentum.  Sterling gained for a fourth day versus the U.S. currency
after a government report last week showed Britain’s economy
avoided a recession last quarter, damping speculation the  Bank
of England  will boost stimulus. U.K. government bonds rose as
Germany’s inflation rate slumped. Slower inflation enhances the
value of the fixed payments from government securities.  “Investors have been very downbeat on their expectations
of the U.K. economic performance so the recent data has been a
surprise to the upside,” said  Neil Jones , head of hedge-fund
sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  London . “There was a lot
of anti-sterling sentiment. The data is proving to be slightly
better than expected.”  The pound advanced 0.2 percent to $1.5504 at 4:21 p.m.
London time after climbing to $1.5546 earlier, the highest level
since Feb. 15. The four-day rally is the longest since Nov. 21.
Sterling dropped 0.4 percent to 84.51 pence per euro after
appreciating to 83.98 pence on April 26, the strongest since
Jan. 24.  Average  house prices  in England and  Wales  increased 0.3
percent, matching the gain in March that was the biggest in
three years, Hometrack Ltd. said in an e-mailed statement.
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  said a survey of U.K. businesses showed
their  confidence  in the economy compared with three months
earlier increased to 27 in April from 20 in March.  Exceeding Forecasts  The U.K.  economy  expanded 0.3 percent in the first quarter,
the  Office for National Statistics  said April 25. The median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for growth
of 0.1 percent.  The pound has gained 1.5 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track
10 developed-nation currencies. The euro gained 1.7 percent and
the dollar weakened 0.7 percent.  The Bank of England next meets on May 8-9 after policy
makers were split this month on whether to extend the 375
billion-pound asset-purchase  program , or so-called quantitative
easing, which tends to debase a currency.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. said last week money-market rates
signal the central bank will increase its asset-purchase target
by 70 billion pounds. The indications are from the bank’s own
calculation based on derivatives linked to the sterling
overnight index average, or Sonia.  While JPMorgan predicts the central bank will refrain from
adding more stimulus next month, it predicts the bond-purchase
program will be expanded by 50 billion pounds in August.  Gilts Gain  Ten-year gilts advanced for a second day as the German
Federal Statistics Office said the annual inflation rate dropped
to 1.1 percent in April, the lowest in more than 2 1/2 years.  The 10-year yield fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.65 percent after dropping five basis
points on April 26. The 1.75 percent bond due September 2022
rose 0.225, or 2.25 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to
100.84.  U.K.  government securities  returned 1.8 percent this year
through April 26, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds gained 1.1 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  earned 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
