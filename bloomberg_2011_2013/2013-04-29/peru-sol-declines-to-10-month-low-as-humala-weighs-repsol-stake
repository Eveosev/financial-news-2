Peru’s sol sank to a 10-month low
after President Ollanta Humala said the government may purchase
shares in  Repsol SA (REP) ’s local unit, fueling concern he plans to
increase state control of the economy.  The sol dropped 0.5 percent to 2.6500 per  U.S. dollar  at
11:54 a.m. in  Lima , the weakest level on a closing basis since
July 2, according to prices from Datatec. The sol tumbled 1.7
percent last week in the biggest five-day decline since October
2009 as commodities plunged on concern expansion of the world’s
largest economies is slowing.  The currency dropped today after Humala said in a TV
interview that Peru is considering buying a minority stake in
the refinery that was sold to Repsol during government asset
sales in the 1990s.  “Peru has been lauded for growing without any government
intervention,”  Pedro Tuesta , a Washington-based Latin America
economist at 4Cast Inc., said in a phone interview.  Finance Minister Miguel Castilla told the state news agency
Andina that he hadn’t resigned after the Lima-based Expreso
newspaper said he may have quit in protest over the government’s
plan to purchase Repsol’s assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark sol bond maturing in
August 2020 was little changed at 3.74 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price declined 0.1 centimo to
125.80 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
