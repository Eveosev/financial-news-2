Good Energy Group Plc (GOOD) , a British
renewable-power supplier, won a 7.5 million-pound ($12 million)
loan from Lloyds TSB Bank Plc to advance its wind and solar
project plans.  The three-year revolving loan combined with a current
overdraft facility gives the Wiltshire-based company 10.5
million pounds in total from Lloyds, Good Energy said today in a
statement.  The company will use the loan to advance its solar and wind
projects with longer development times requiring funding
flexibility, Garry Peagam, finance director, said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
