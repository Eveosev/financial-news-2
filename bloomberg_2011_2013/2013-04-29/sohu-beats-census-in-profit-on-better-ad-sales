Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU) , owner of  China ’s
third-largest search engine, posted first-quarter profit that
beat analyst estimates on higher online advertising sales.  Net income rose 14 percent to $23 million, the Beijing-
based company said in a statement today. That  beat  the $18.8
million average of six analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 36 percent to $308 million, compared with
the average of analysts’ estimate of $296 million.  Sohu has expanded into online videos and search in
competition with  Baidu Inc. (BIDU)  to diversify its  sales  channels and
depend less on its Web portal business in China, which has more
Internet users than the population of any country except India.
Revenue from online advertisements rose 41 percent from a year
earlier to $116 million, it said.  “Online advertising was better than expected,” Eric Qiu,
an analyst at Guosen Securities Co. in Hong Kong, said by
telephone before the results. “Most of the ad growth is coming
from its portal website and search business,” said Qiu, who
recommends buying the stock.  Second-quarter revenue will be between $333 million and
$342 million, Sohu said. That compares with the $318 million
average of seven analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sohu’s American depositary receipts  rose  0.9 percent to
$50.77 in  New York  trading on April 26. The receipts have gained
7.3 percent in 2013, after falling in the past two years.  Sohu’s Sogou accounted for 5.4 percent of search-engine
queries in China in the fourth quarter, trailing Baidu’s 82.3
percent and Qihoo 360 Technology Co.’s 8.2 percent, according to
Bloomberg Industries.  Sohu’s Web portal, China’s third largest, had 306 million
unique visitors in December.  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) ’s QQ.com was
the Chinese market leader with 421 million unique visitors as of
December 2012, following by  Sina Corp. (SINA)  with 332 million,
according to Bloomberg Industries.  China had 564 million Internet users at the end of last
year, up 10 percent from the year before, according to the
government-run China Internet Network Information Center. That
is greater than the population of any country except  India .  To contact the reporter on this story:
