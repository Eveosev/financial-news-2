Gold futures rose on speculation
that the  Federal Reserve  will maintain bond purchases to bolster
the  U.S. economy , while demand for coins and jewelry climbed.  Slowing inflation offers the Fed more scope to provide the
economy with more liquidity and lower  interest rates  for longer.
 Chow Sang Sang Holdings International Ltd. (116)  said that jewelry
sales at its 44 shops in Hong Kong more than doubled in the two
weeks ended April from a year ago. Last week, gold jumped 4.2
percent, the most in 15 months, partly as coin demand from mints
in the U.S. and Australia soared after futures on April 15
plunged 9.3 percent, the most in 33 years.  “The Fed meeting is crucial as data out of U.S. has been
mixed,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage
Services LLC in Chicago said in a telephone interview.
“Physical demand continues to remain strong.”  Gold futures for June delivery gained 0.9 percent to settle
at $1,467.40 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in New York. The
price headed for the biggest monthly drop since December 2011
after entering a  bear market  on April 12.  This month, holdings in exchange-traded  products  backed by
gold have slumped 166.27 metric tons, heading for a record
decline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On April 23,
bets on a Comex price drop by  hedge funds  and other large
speculators were 69,726 futures and options, within 0.6 percent
of the all-time high reached six weeks earlier, U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data showed on April 26.  Coin Sales  Coin sales by the  U.S. Mint  headed for the highest since
December 2009, while  inventory  monitored by the Comex last week
touched the lowest since July 2008.  “The key question in the near term is whether retail and
jewelry demand can continue to counter ETP outflows and the rise
in gross shorts,” Barclays Plc analysts  Suki Cooper , Lynnden Branigan and Christoper Louney said in a report. “In our view,
the vulnerability of further ETP outflows subsides should prices
recover to above the $1,500 level or equity markets
underperform, given the stronger correlation between the two.”  HSBC cut its estimate for gold’s average price this year to
$1,542 from $1,700, saying that the “capitulation in the gold
price dealt a severe blow to investor confidence, which may take
many months to restore.”  Silver futures for July delivery gained 1.6 percent to
$24.166 an ounce on the Comex. The price has dropped 20 percent
this year.  Platinum Advances  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery rose 2.1 percent to $1,507.40 an ounce.  Earlier, the price jumped as much as 3.3 percent amid
concern that supplies from Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. may be
disrupted.  Zimbabwe Mines Secretary Prince Mupazviriho said that the
country has no intention of stopping the acquisition of some
land from an Impala unit as an appeal is discussed.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. is the world’s biggest
producer, following by Impala. The companies are based in  South
Africa .  Palladium futures for June delivery climbed 2.5 percent to
$699.20 an ounce, the biggest gain since March 20.  To contact the reporters on this story:
