AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (AU) , the world’s
third-largest producer of the metal, has a shortlist of bidders
for its Navachab mine in  Namibia  after “good interest” in the
asset.  “From the initial group we’ve selected a shortlist of
parties that will proceed to the next phase of the process,
after which these shortlisted bidders will be required to submit
a binding offer,” Stewart Bailey, a New York-based spokesman,
said in an e-mailed response to questions yesterday.  AngloGold planned to review whether Navachab should be
sold,  Mark Cutifani , the company’s then chief executive officer,
said on Aug. 6. AngloGold’s stock has dropped 35 percent this
year in Johannesburg after the bullion price slumped to the
lowest in more than two years.  AngloGold’s Navachab gold mine is situated close to
Karibib, about 170 kilometers (106 miles) northwest of the
capital, Windhoek. The open-pit mine, which began operations in
1989, has a 120,000 metric ton-a-month processing plant,
according to the company’s annual report. The mine produced
74,000 ounces of gold last year and cash costs were $929 per
ounce. Gold traded at $1,468.03 an ounce as of 8:05 p.m. in
London.  “Interest is strong in what remains a good asset in an
attractive jurisdiction,” Bailey said by phone.  AngloGold is being advised on the sale by  CIBC World
Markets .  To contact the reporter on this story:
