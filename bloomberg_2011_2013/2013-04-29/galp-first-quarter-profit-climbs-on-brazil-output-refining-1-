Galp Energia SGPS SA,  Portugal ’s
biggest oil company, said first-quarter profit rose 52 percent
as Brazilian production increased and refining margins widened.  Adjusted net income climbed to 75 million euros ($98
million) from 50 million euros a year earlier, the Lisbon-based
company said today in a statement. That beat the 67.4 million-
euro mean  estimate  of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Profit
on that basis excludes one-time items and inventory changes.  Galp is exploring in Brazil’s offshore Santos Basin, where
its Lula project is located, to boost access to crude oil
supplies and curb dependence on refining and fuel sales in
Portugal and  Spain . The oil products market contracted by 7
percent in each of those countries last year.  The Portuguese company on March 5 said it will boost
investment from next year to increase reserves and output.
Annual investment will be 1.4 billion to 1.6 billion euros for
2014 to 2017. Galp plans to invest 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion
euros this year.  Galp on March 5 said it’s “on track” to meet its
production target of 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in
2020. It has stakes in four offshore blocks in the  Santos Basin ,
including 10 percent of Lula, the largest find in the Americas
since  Mexico ’s Cantarell field in 1976.  Production Growth  The Cidade de Paraty floating production, storage and
offloading vessel will start production at the Lula field in the
beginning of June, “contributing to relevant production growth
in the second half,” Galp said in a presentation. The FPSO is
expected to produce about 75,000 barrels a day by the end of
2013, it said.  Average working-interest production rose 4.3 percent from a
year earlier to 23,500 barrels a day, Galp said. Average net
entitlement output, which includes the effect of production-
sharing agreements, climbed 21 percent to 20,100 barrels a day.
The average selling price fell 15 percent.  Galp targets working-interest production of about 22,000
barrels a day for the second quarter as the Cidade de Angra dos
Reis FPSO in  Brazil  undergoes maintenance work.  Refinery Upgrade  Galp has also invested in refinery upgrades to increase
diesel production. The hydrocracker at the Sines plant started
commercial production on Jan. 10, marking completion of a 1.4
billion-euro investment on a conversion project at its
refineries. The plant in Oporto can process about 110,000
barrels a day, while the Sines refinery has a 220,000-barrel-a-
day capacity.  The refineries ran at 73 percent of capacity last quarter
and processed 6.3 percent more crude. Refined-product sales
volumes dropped 4 percent. The refining margin, a measure of
profit from turning oil to fuels, widened to $1.80 a barrel from
80 cents a year earlier.  The company’s refining system is “ready” to increase
profitability from the second quarter, “considering the
international market dynamics,” Galp said in the presentation.  Natural-gas sales slipped 0.2 percent to 1.72 billion cubic
meters in the first quarter. Galp said it sold eight cargoes of
liquefied natural gas in the period.  Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose 24 percent to 253 million euros in the first
quarter. Ebitda will rise at a compound annual growth rate of
more than 25 percent from 2012 to 2017, Galp said March 5.  Galp  shares  have advanced 4 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 10 billion euros. The stock added 1.5
percent to 12.22 euros as of 9:02 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
