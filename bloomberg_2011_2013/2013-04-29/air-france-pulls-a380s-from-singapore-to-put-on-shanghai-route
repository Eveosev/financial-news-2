Air France  (AF) will begin serving  Shanghai  three times weekly with Airbus SAS double-decker A380s, taking superjumbos off its Paris-to-Singapore line for use on the China route.  Air France serves Singapore seven times weekly, currently four times weekly with A380s and three times a week with Boeing 777-300s. All Singapore flights will now use the smaller Boeing plane, said Ulli Gendrot, a spokeswoman for the airline in Paris.  “ Air France-KLM (AF) ’s policy is to ensure optimum use of its planes in adapting its offer to take into account demand and market context,” Gendrot said in an e-mail.  Air France, a unit of Air France KLM Group, won’t be the only carrier flying the superjumbo to Shanghai.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) , which already flies A340s daily to Shanghai, will add five weekly Frankfurt-Shanghai services with the A380 from September.  Air France’s A380s flying to Singapore seat 516, compared with 303 for the Boeing 777-300s, the airline said.
