Russia  may gradually phase out  oil
export duties  while increasing the mineral extraction tax,
according to Anton Siluanov, finance minister for the world’s
largest oil-producing nation.  The ministry’s proposals on lowering the export duty rate
by about 2-3 percent points annually, starting as early as next
year, will probably be ready in mid-May, Ilya Trunin, head of
the ministry’s tax department, told reporters in Moscow.  At the same time, the mineral extraction tax would be
raised to compensate the budget for any losses from the
measures, he said.  Russia’s oil industry has sought tax relief as Soviet-era
deposits age and the need to tap new fields in remote regions
raises the cost of maintaining production. Russia, which relies
on crude and gas revenues for about half of its revenue, has
little room to give the industry breaks with the budget in
deficit and amid large-scale spending on projects such as the
2014 Winter Olympics and 2018  World Cup .  The proposal would the lower crude export duty rate to 57
percent to 58 percent of crude prices from the current 60
percent, Trunin said. It would also lower rates for refined
product, which are calculated as a fraction of crude.  To contact the reporters on this story:
