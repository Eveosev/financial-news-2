Billionaire Barry Diller said the
Internet TV startup Aereo Inc. he backs could attract 10 million
to 20 million subscribers when it begins to market the service
widely.  The company, which picks up over-the-air broadcast signals
and transmits them via the Internet to subscribers who pay $8 a
month, will upend the cable television business model, Diller,
71, said today at the Milken Institute Global Conference in
Beverly Hills, California,  Aereo, which has so far defeated court efforts to halt the
service, has expanded from New York to  Boston  and will be in 22
cities by the end of the year, according to Diller, chairman of
IAC/InterActive Corp. Reaching 10 million to 20 million
customers would let Aereo offer programing and services in
competition with cable companies.  “I really believe that we’re just starting with video on
the Internet, and it is going to absolutely change most
things,” Diller said.“It will break up the bundled system of
television.”  Diller, co-creater of the Fox Broadcast Network, said
incumbent media companies are “suing us relentlessly.”  “Do not put your hand in front of a train,” Diller said,
“and that’s what the Internet is.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
