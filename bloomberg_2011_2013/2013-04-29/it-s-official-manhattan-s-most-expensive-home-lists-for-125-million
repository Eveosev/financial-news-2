Being crowned the " most expensive listing in Manhattan " is quite a feat. Not only are  average prices in the Big Apple  thousands more than the  median home prices across the country , but Manhattan is already home to a  $115 million penthouse ,  owned by Steven Cohen , as well as the  $90 million Woolworth penthouse . And now we can officially add a  $125 million penthouse  to that expensive roundup. At first rumored to be listed at $120 million, the Pierre Hotel penthouse just hit the market under brokerage Sotheby's International Realty for that steep $125 million. Located at  795 Fifth Avenue  on the  Upper East Side , the penthouse occupies the entire 41st, 42nd and 43rd floors. The apartment contains 16 rooms, including 5 en-suite bedrooms and 6 bathrooms, plus 4 terraces with sweeping views of Manhattan. As expected, the living spaces are grand with 23-foot-high ceilings, large windows and architectural details. A private elevator connects all three floors, and the home has a separate guest suite and staff residences. The five fireplaces were made in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The home was previously owned by author and stock market analyst Martin Zweig, who died in February at the age of 70. He's best known for accurately predicting the 1987 market crash three days before it happened. He bought the apartment in 1999 for $21.5 million in an all-cash transaction, as the  Pierre Hotel does not permit financing . Whoever buys the penthouse won't be worrying about a $439,002 monthly mortgage payment (assuming a 20 percent down payment on a  30-year mortgage ) but will be paying the $47,000 monthly maintenance bill.
