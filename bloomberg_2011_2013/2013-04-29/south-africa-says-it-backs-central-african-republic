South Africa  gave its support to a
transitional administration in the Central African Republic
following a meeting between President  Jacob Zuma  and that
nation’s Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye.  Yesterday’s talks in South Africa came after the Seleka
rebel alliance, which toppled President Francois Bozize in
Central African Republic on March 24, agreed to demands from
regional leaders to form a transitional government and hold
elections within 18 months. South Africa withdrew its troops
stationed in the crisis-ridden country after 13 soldiers were
killed in clashes with rebels last month.  “South Africa welcomes the efforts of the transitional
government in the Central African Republic to comply with the
decisions” of regional leaders, the Department of International
Relations and Cooperation said today in an e-mailed statement.  Zuma, who has faced criticism from opposition political
parties following the soldiers’ deaths, said in an interview
last week he is ready to deploy new troops to  Central African
Republic  as part of a multinational peacekeeping force.  To contact the reporter on this story:
