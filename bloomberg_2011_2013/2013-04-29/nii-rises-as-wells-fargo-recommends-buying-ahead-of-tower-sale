NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) , which sells
Nextel mobile-phone service in  Latin America , jumped in New York
trading after Wells Fargo & Co. recommended buying the shares.  NII climbed 5.4 percent to $9.31 at the close in New York.
The shares have  risen  31 percent this year, outpacing the 12
percent gain of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The company may get a higher price than most analysts
estimate for the wireless towers it’s selling, said  Jennifer Fritzsche , a Wells Fargo analyst, in a research note. The
company is also improving in Mexico and Brazil as its 3G mobile-
phone services expand, she said, increasing her rating to
outperform from market perform.  The carrier, based in Reston, Virginia, is selling off
assets to concentrate on its business in Latin America’s two
largest economies, Brazil and Mexico. NII agreed earlier this
month to sell its Peru unit to Chile’s Empresa Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones SA for $400 million, and Chief Executive
Officer Steve Shindler said last week that the company is “very
close” to a deal to sell its towers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
