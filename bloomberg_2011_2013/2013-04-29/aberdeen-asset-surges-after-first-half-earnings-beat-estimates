Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN) ,
 Scotland ’s largest money manager, rose the most in almost four
years after first-half revenue and profit beat market estimates.  The  shares  climbed as much as 9.4 percent, the biggest
intraday rise since May 2009, and were up 37.8 pence, or 9
percent, to 455 pence, at 11:45 a.m. in London trading, the
highest since January 2001, adding 442 million pounds ($667
million) to its market value and extending its gain this year to
24 percent. The Aberdeen, Scotland-based company was the best
performer in the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  and the Stoxx 60 Financial
Services Index.  The company is “highly unlikely” to buy Scottish Widows
Investment Partnership, which London-based  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc (LLOY)  is looking to sell, Chief Executive Officer Martin Gilbert
said today on a conference call.  “It would take something especially attractive for us to
make a large  acquisition ,” he said. “Since we announced we
weren’t going to do large acquisitions, the shares have risen
fivefold.”  Aberdeen has been boosting profitability as clients buy
higher-margin products while outflows have been from bond assets
paying lower fees. The company, which has been seeking to stem
inflows into its emerging-market funds, said it saw modest
outflows from those funds in March after closing them to new
U.S. clients and implementing introductory charges elsewhere.  Funds under management rose 13 percent to 212.3 billion
pounds in the six months through March 31 from the start of the
financial year.  Earnings Rise  Underlying first-half pretax profit rose 37 percent to
222.8 million pounds from 162.2 million pounds a year earlier,
Aberdeen said in a statement. That beat the median estimate of
212 million pounds of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Adjusted earnings per share jumped 43 percent to 14.9 pence
from 10.4 pence a year earlier, beating the  median estimate  of
six analysts of 13.7 pence. First-half revenue rose 25 percent
to 516 million pounds, also topping the median estimate of six
analysts of 501 million pounds.  Aberdeen will look to share buybacks to return surplus
capital to investors in addition to a progressive dividend
policy, Gilbert said on the call. The buybacks will start once
the company has a “comfortable level of headroom” over its
required regulatory capital, it said in the statement. The
first-half dividend was increased 36 percent to 6 pence a share.  Aberdeen had net new money of 4.4 billion pounds in the
first half, including net inflows of 7.8 billion pounds into
equity funds and 1.4 billion pounds into emerging-market debt
funds.  Lloyds has hired Deutsche Bank AG to advise on a possible
sale of Edinburgh-based SWIP, which oversees about 142 billion
pounds, to boost its capital, Bloomberg reported April 18. The
asset manager had a pretax profit of 108 million pounds last
year, up from 99 million pounds in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
