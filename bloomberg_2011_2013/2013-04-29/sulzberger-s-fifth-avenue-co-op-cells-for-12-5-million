A Manhattan co-op that belonged to Arthur O. Sulzberger, the former publisher of the  New York  Times who died in September, sold for $12.5 million.  The buyer of the four-bedroom apartment at 1010 Fifth Ave. was Alessandro Saracino, according to property records made public yesterday by the New York City Department of Finance. The deal for unit 8A was completed on April 11.  “This is the A-line, which is the most prized line of the building, right on the corner of 82nd Street,” Pat Wheatley, the broker from  Sotheby’s International Realty  who shared the  listing  with colleague Sheila Ellis, said in a telephone interview. “You’re looking at the front of the  Metropolitan Museum  and, particularly in the evening, that makes you feel like you’re in  Europe . It’s very grand.”  The 11-room property was put on the market in December for $14 million, according to listings website StreetEasy.com. It  includes  a wood-burning fireplace, a library and three maids’ rooms, according to the listing, which touts it as “home of one of the world’s most prestigious and well-known families.”  Sulzberger, who was publisher of the Times for three decades, transformed the newspaper into a publicly owned media company with magazine, television, radio-station and newspaper holdings in the U.S. and Europe. He died on Sept. 29 at the age of 86 at his home in Southampton, New York. He had been ill with  Parkinson’s disease .
