Canadian  stocks  rose as commodities
from oil to gold rallied amid optimism over central-bank
stimulus and data showed U.S. consumer spending climbed more
than expected in March.  Capstone Mining Corp. (CS)  added 3.1 percent after agreeing to
buy a copper mine in Arizona from BHP Billiton Ltd.  Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX)  gained 4.3 percent amid
reports the drugmaker is in talks to merge with Actavis Inc.
Gabriel Resources Ltd. and Kirkland Lake Gold Inc. surged at
least 4.2 percent as gold rallied to pare the worst monthly loss
since December 2011.  The  Standard & Poorâ€™s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 59.42
points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,279.62 at 9:55 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark equity gauge has fallen 3.7 percent in April and
is headed for the biggest monthly decline since May 2012.  Crude and gold prices advanced on optimism that central
banks will decide to maintain economic stimulus in their
meetings this week to bolster growth. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg said European Central Bank policy makers may cut
interest rates, while the U.S. Federal Reserve will consider
renewing its commitment to bond-buying at a two-day meeting
starting tomorrow.  Consumer spending  in the U.S., the biggest oil-consuming
nation, rose more than projected in March, a Commerce Department
report showed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
