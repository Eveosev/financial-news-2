The wreckage found last week in
lower  Manhattan  and believed to be from one of the planes in the
Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks came from a Boeing 767, a
technician for the company told investigators.  A  Boeing Co. (BA)  technician confirmed to New York City police
detectives yesterday that the piece of gear wedged between the
rear of 51 Park Place and the rear of a neighboring building is
called a trailing edge flap actuation support structure, police
department spokesman Paul Browne said today in a statement.  Investigators haven’t determined which plane the part came
from, the police said in the statement. The department is
working with the medical examiner’s office as it prepares to
sift soil at the location for human remains.  Surveyors for the property owner of 51 Park Place were
inspecting the rear of the building April 24 when they found
what they thought was damaged machinery and called the police.
The site is being treated as a crime scene, authorities said.  Terrorists hijacked airliners, flew them into two World
Trade Center towers and the Pentagon, and crashed a fourth in a
field in  Pennsylvania , killing 2,996 people.  To contact the reporters on this story:
