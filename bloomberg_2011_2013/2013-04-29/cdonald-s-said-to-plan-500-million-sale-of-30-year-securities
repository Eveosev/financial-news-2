McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s
largest restaurant chain by sales, plans to raise $500 million
with a sale of 30-year bonds.  The company intends to issue the securities to fund general
corporate purposes, according to a person familiar with the
offering who asked not to be identified because terms aren’t
set. McDonald’s debt is  rated  A2 by Moody’s Investors Service
and an equivalent A at Standard & Poor’s.  The fast-food producer, based in  Oak Brook , Illinois, last
sold new 30-year debentures in February 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Its $500 million of 3.7 percent debt due
February 2042 traded at 100.4 cents on the dollar April 25 to
yield 3.68 percent, or 74.9 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
