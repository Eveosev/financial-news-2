VTB Group led gains among Russian
stocks after the nation’s second-largest lender said investors
agreed to buy all $3.3 billion of shares it’s selling to
increase capital.  VTB surged  as much as  4.7 percent, adding 2.8 percent to
4.66 kopeks by 2:28 p.m. in Moscow. More than 64 billion
securities changed hands, equivalent to about 1.5 times the
three-month average. Global depositary receipts jumped 4.2
percent to $2.957 in  London . The benchmark  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  retreated
0.3 percent, after climbing as much as 0.6 percent.  The bank has orders from new and existing shareholders,
including Norges Bank Investment Management, the world’s largest
sovereign fund, Qatar Holding LLC and  Azerbaijan’s State Oil
Fund , Moscow-based VTB said today in a statement. The three
sovereign funds took more than 50 percent of the offering, Chief
Financial Officer  Herbert Moos  said on a conference call.  “VTB is rising on the confirmation that long-term
investors are buying shares and there won’t be an overhang,”
Andrey Tretelnikov, an analyst at Rye, Man & Gor Securities,
said by phone from Moscow. “Now VTB won’t have problems with
capital.”  VTB plans to sell the stock on the Moscow Exchange to boost
regulatory capital depleted by acquisitions including OAO Bank
of Moscow, OAO TransCreditBank and a buyback of minority
investors. The share sale will lift its Tier 1 Capital ratio to
11.9 percent from 10.3 percent at the end of March, VTB said.  The state-run bank is selling 2.5 trillion new shares at
4.1 kopeks apiece, VTB said on April 26. The government  stake  of
75.5 percent in VTB is expected to fall to 60.93 percent
following the placement, VTB said today. Buyers of the new
shares won’t be eligible to receive 2012 dividends, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
