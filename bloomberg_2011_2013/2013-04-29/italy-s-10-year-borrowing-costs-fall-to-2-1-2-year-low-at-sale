Italy’s 10-year borrowing costs
declined to a 2 1/2-year low at an auction today after new Prime
Minister Enrico Letta was sworn in, ending a two-month political
standoff caused by inconclusive elections.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 3 billion euros ($3.9 billion)
of bonds maturing in May 2023 at 3.94 percent, down from 4.66
percent at a March 27 auction. That’s the lowest since October
2010. Investors bid for 1.42 times the amount offered, up from
1.33 last month. The Treasury also sold 3 billion euros of debt
maturing in 2018 at 2.84 percent, down from 3.65 percent at the
March 27 auction.  Letta, 46, of the majority Democratic Party, managed to
form a government after forging an alliance with Silvio
Berlusconi, resurrecting the coalition that stood behind the
previous government of Mario Monti. While the deal gives Letta a
majority in parliament, he will have to mediate between the
competing agenda of his party and Berlusconi’s coalition which
historically have been on opposite sides.  “For the time being, this is certainly to be preferred to
the unclear situation beforehand,”  Peter Schaffrik , head of
European interest rate strategy for Royal Bank of Canada, wrote
in a note to investors today. The appointment of Bank of Italy
veteran Fabrizio Saccomanni as finance minister is “a very
market friendly appointment as he is seen to be close to
European Central Bank president Draghi.”  Yields are also being pushed lower by expectations that the
ECB will cut interest rates as European economies show signs of
slowdown.  Germany ’s  Ifo index  of business confidence fell more
than forecast last week and euro-area gauges of manufacturing
and services activity for April showed weakness in output.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield dropped below 4 percent on April
22 for the first time since November 2010 and was down 11 basis
points to 3.95 percent after the sale at 11:18 a.m. in  Rome .  To contact the reporter on this story:
