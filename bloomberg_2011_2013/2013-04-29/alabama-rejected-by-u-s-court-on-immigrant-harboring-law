The U.S. Supreme Court, steering
clear of the debate over immigration policy, refused to revive
an  Alabama  law that made it a crime to harbor people who are in
the country illegally.  The high court today rejected Alabama’s appeal, leaving
intact a ruling that said the state infringed on federal
authority by enacting the provision as part of an effort to
drive away undocumented immigrants. The rebuff is a victory for
the Obama administration, which sued to challenge the law.  In throwing out the provision, an Atlanta-based federal
appeals court pointed to a Supreme Court decision last year
invalidating parts of Arizona’s immigration law.  The rejection comes as Congress debates proposals to create
a path to citizenship for millions of people who entered the
U.S. illegally or stayed after their visas had expired.  Justice  Antonin Scalia  dissented from today’s court action
without giving an explanation. The case is Alabama v.  United
States , 12-884.  To contact the reporter on this story:
