South Korea ’s industrial production
declined in March as the yen’s decline clouds the outlook for
the nation’s exports.  Output fell 2.6 percent from February when it slid 0.9
percent, Statistics  Korea  said today. The median estimate of 11
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 0.9 percent
decline. Production fell 3 percent from a year earlier.  Weakness in the yen, which aids export rivals in  Japan , is
likely to have a bigger impact on South Korea’s economy from
this quarter, Bank of Korea director general Kim Young Bae said
yesterday.  Gross domestic product  grew at the fastest pace in
two years in the first quarter, gaining 0.9 percent from the
previous three months.  The government this month announced a $15 billion extra
budget and property stimulus package, while the  Bank of Korea 
left borrowing costs unchanged.  Finance Minister Hyun Oh Seok on April 28 said the
government was days away from unveiling policies to spur
corporate investment. The government is also preparing measures,
including loan and marketing support, to help smaller exporters
grappling with the sliding yen, he said.  Japan’s currency dropped about 19 percent against the
dollar in the six months through yesterday, compared with the
won’s decline of about 1 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
