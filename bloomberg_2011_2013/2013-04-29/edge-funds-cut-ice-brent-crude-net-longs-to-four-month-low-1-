Hedge funds and other money
managers cut  bullish bets  on Brent crude to their lowest level
in four months for a third consecutive week, according to data
from ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 99,127 lots in
the week ended April 23, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitment of Traders report. The reduction of 8,973
contracts, or 8.3 percent leaves so-called net-longs at their
lowest since Dec. 11.  Bearish positions by  producers , merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 279,959, up by
26,396, or 10.4 percent. Net-shorts in this category are at the
highest January 2011, the starting point for the data.  Brent crude  advanced 1.8 percent to $101.73 a barrel in the
week to April 23 on the ICE exchange, and traded for $103.10 a
barrel as of 12:28 p.m. London time today.  Swaps dealers  were net-long 228,225 lots, up 39,608 or 21
percent from a week earlier, in a 10th straight increase to
their highest level since the data began.  Money managers’ net-long bets on European  gasoil  futures
decreased by 15,847 contracts, or 82 percent, to 3,483, the
lowest level since the data were published in January 2011.  Funds were net-short U.S. heating oil by 18,318 contracts
on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, the biggest net-short
position since January 2007, according to data published on
April 26 by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as  hedge funds  and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves.  Analysts and investors follow changes in speculators’
positions because such transactions can reflect an expectation
of a change in prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
