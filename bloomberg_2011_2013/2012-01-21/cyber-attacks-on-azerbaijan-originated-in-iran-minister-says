Cyber attacks that destroyed
government and news websites in Azerbaijan this week mostly
originated in  Iran , government minister Ali Abbasov said.  An investigation by Abbasov’s Ministry of Communications
and  Information Technology  found that of 25 attacks, 24 came
from Iran and one from the Netherlands, Abbasov told reporters
in the Azeri capital, Baku, today.  “Yesterday we sent a letter to the Iranian side asking
them to identify the exact addresses from where the attacks were
carried out,” Abbasov said, adding he hoped the Iranian
government was not involved.  Websites that were hacked on Jan. 16 included those of the
ruling New Azerbaijan Party and the interior and communications
ministries. Comments criticizing the Azeri government and  Israel 
were posted on some of the websites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
