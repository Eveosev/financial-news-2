Mohammad Al-Mojil Group Co. (MMG)  plunged
the most since April 2009 after the Saudi construction-services
company forecast “substantial losses” that will exceed 10
percent of its total assets.  The shares tumbled 9.9 percent, the maximum movement
allowed in one trading day, to 21.50 Saudi riyals, at 12:23 p.m.
in Riyadh.  The losses are “due to additional costs of materials,
equipment and manpower of some of the ongoing projects in excess
of the approved budgets,” the Dammam, Saudi Arabia-based
company said in a statement to the Saudi Stock Exchange after
the close of trading on Jan. 18.  Al-Mojil said it has hired an international company for
technical consultancy to review the projects, which are subject
to expected losses. The external auditors will review the
losses, it said. The company will also delay publishing its
quarterly results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
