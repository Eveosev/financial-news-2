The  New York Rangers  beat the Boston
Bruins 3-2 in overtime in a matchup of the top two teams in the
National Hockey League’s Eastern Conference.  Marian Gaborik’s power-play goal with 3.6 seconds remaining
in the extra period gave New York the victory at the TD Garden
in Boston. The Rangers top the Eastern Conference with 64
points, two more than the defending Stanley Cup champion Bruins,
and are one point behind the  Detroit Red Wings  for the most
points in the NHL.  New York’s Ryan Callahan opened the scoring 1:31 into the
second period and Andrew Ference pulled Boston even less than
two minutes later. Gaborik put the Rangers back in front later
in the period and the Bruins once again tied on Adam McQuad’s
goal in the final minute of the second.  After a scoreless third period, the game went to overtime
and Gaborik scored with a backhand shot after Ference was given
a game misconduct penalty for charging Ryan McDonagh.  Henrik Lundqvist made 32 saves in the Rangers goal, while
Boston’s Tuukka Rask stopped 30 shots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
