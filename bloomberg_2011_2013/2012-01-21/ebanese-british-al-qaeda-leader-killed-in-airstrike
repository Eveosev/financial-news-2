Bilaal Al-Berjawi, an al-Qaeda
leader born in Lebanon and raised in the U.K., was killed by a
drone strike in Mogadishu’s outskirts today, a militant Islamic
group’s spokesman said.  “He was in a pickup truck at Al-Hayat Hospital in
Mogadishu’s outskirts,”  Al-Shabaab ’s Ali Raji told reporters in
a teleconference. Al-Berjawi was 20 to 30 years old and had been
in the capital Mogadishu since 2006, he said.  Residents said they heard loud explosions and then saw
black smoke rising around the hospital in an area of Mogadishu
under control of Al-Shabaab.  “I heard very big explosions,” Suldaan Bakeeri, a
resident at the hospital, said in a telephone interview. “The
ground vibrated, and I believed that a heavy missile rocketed in
my home, but fortunately I was safe.”  Joanne Moore, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
