Manchester United manager  Alex
Ferguson  said he expects midfielder  Darren Fletcher  to miss the
rest of the season.  United announced last month that Fletcher was taking an
indefinite break after suffering from ulcerative colitis, a
chronic bowel condition.  “I don’t expect Darren Fletcher to come back,” Ferguson
said on United’s website. “Darren will be out for the season.”  United is second in the Premier League, three points behind
 Manchester City , ahead of its visit to Arsenal tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
