Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , a diversified
investment company controlled by Saudi billionaire Prince
Alwaleed bin Talal, said fourth-quarter profit declined 20
percent on “a decrease in performance” from operations in the
 Middle East .  Net income  fell to 187.8 million riyals ($50.1 million)
from 234.6 million riyals a year earlier, the company said in a
 statement  to the Saudi bourse today. Operating income decreased
36.4 percent to 168.4 million riyals.  Non-oil producing Middle Eastern economies suffered last
year as popular revolts eroded income from tourism,
manufacturing and construction. Kingdom Hotel Investments, a
unit of Kingdom Holding, operates two Movenpick Hotels & Resorts
AG hotels in Egypt and Four Seasons hotels in Beirut and
Damascus, according to the company’s website.  Egypt ’s gross domestic product grew 1.8 percent in the
fiscal year ending June 30, its weakest performance in at least
10 years. In Syria, where the United Nations says more than
5,000 people have died from the political unrest, the
 International Monetary Fund  forecasts a contraction of 2 percent
last year while London-based research company Business Monitor
International says the economy contracted 9.6 percent in 2011.  The reason for the change in net income for the fourth
quarter is due to “a decrease in performance from associates,
and hotel operations due to recent events in the Middle East,”
Kingdom Holding said in its statement.  The  shares  were unchanged at 10.05 riyals at 11:04 a.m. in
Riyadh, valuing the company at 37.2 billion riyals. The stock
gained 8 percent last year compared with a 3 percent drop in the
benchmark  Saudi Tadawul All Share Index. (SASEIDX)   To contact the reporters on this story:
