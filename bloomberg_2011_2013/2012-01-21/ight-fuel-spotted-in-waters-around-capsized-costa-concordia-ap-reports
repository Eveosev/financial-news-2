Light fuel, believed to be diesel,
has been spotted in the sea around the capsized Costa Concordia
cruise ship off the coast of  Italy , the Associated Press said,
citing Coast Guard spokesman Cmdr. Cosimo Nicastro.  The amount of fuel, which could be from machinery on the
stricken vessel, is “very light, very superficial,” AP cited
Nicastro as saying today.  There’s no indication that any of the nearly half-million
gallons (2,200 metric tons) of fuel oil has leaked from the
ship’s double-bottomed tanks, the news agency said, citing
Nicastro.  There are 185 tons of diesel and lubricants on board, AP
reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
