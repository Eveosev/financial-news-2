U.S. President  Barack Obama  said he
plans to propose measures next week aimed at increasing factory
employment, fostering the development of energy and ensuring
that “everybody plays by the same set of rules.”  In a video message to supporters today, Obama offered a
preview of what he intends to outline in his annual State of the
Union address to Congress next week. The speech will lay out his
priorities during a year when he is running for re-election.  The president didn’t offer any specifics today in his
video. He said he’ll outline plans to create “more good jobs”
at U.S. manufacturers, foster energy development, and rebuild
“an economy where hard work pays off and responsibility is
rewarded, and an America where everybody gets a fair shot,
everyone does their fair share and everybody plays by the same
set of rules.”  “I’m going to talk about how we’ll get there,” Obama
said. “I’m going to lay out a blueprint for an American economy
that’s built to last.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
