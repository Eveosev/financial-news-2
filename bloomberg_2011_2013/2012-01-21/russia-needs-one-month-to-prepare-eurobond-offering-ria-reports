Russia needs one month to prepare a
sovereign Eurobond offering, RIA Novosti said, citing Deputy
Finance Minister Sergei Storchak in  Mexico .  “Preparation of all documents requires about one month,
but if we made offering right now, it could have been successful
because even the European countries placed their assets good
enough,” the state news agency reported Storchak as saying at a
meeting of Group of 20 finance officials today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
