European (SXXP)  stocks rose for the fifth
straight week amid signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering, and
amid speculation the euro area will contain its debt crisis and
 China  will reduce curbs on lending.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ,  Societe Generale  SA and
Barclays Plc led a rally among carmakers and banks, climbing
more than 8 percent. Carnival Corp. tumbled 12 percent in London
after a ship belonging to the world’s largest cruise owner ran
aground off the coast of Italy, killing at least 11 people.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  rose 2.7 percent to 255.85 this
past week. The benchmark measure slipped 0.3 percent on Jan. 20,
falling from a five-month high. The gauge has climbed 4.6
percent so far in 2012 for its best start to a year since 1997.  “The U.S. appears to be on the right track at the
moment,” said  Peter Dixon , a global equities economist at
Commerzbank AG in London. In China, “the authorities have the
scope to unwind the monetary tightening they put in place last
year.” He spoke in a Bloomberg Television interview.  Investors’ expectations for global growth increased in
January to the highest level since July, according to a Bank of
America Corp. survey published on Jan. 17. The investors, who
manage a total of $655 billion of assets, increased their
overweight allocation to U.S. equities, while  European (SXXP)  and
Japanese stocks remained out of favor.  China’s Economic Growth  A report on Jan. 17 showed that  China’s economy , the
world’s second biggest, expanded in the fourth quarter at its
slowest pace since 2009. Investors speculated that the slowdown
will increase pressure on Premier  Wen Jiabao  to ease monetary
policy. The People’s Bank of China injected 353 billion yuan
($55.7 billion) into the financial market this week using 14-day
reverse-repurchase contracts, the most since Bloomberg began
collecting the data in early 2008.  In the U.S., a Labor Department report on Jan. 19 showed
that  claims for jobless benefits  plunged by 50,000 to 352,000 in
the week ended Jan. 14, the lowest number since April 2008. The
 median forecast  of 41 economists in a Bloomberg News survey had
called for a reading of 384,000.  European shares rallied this week as Spain and  France  sold
bonds on Jan. 19 at lower yields. France auctioned 7.97 billion
euros ($10.3 billion) of two-, three- and four-year notes in its
first sale of medium- and long-term debt since  Standard & Poor’s 
downgraded the country’s credit rating on Jan. 13. Yields fell
on all maturities.  Spain  sold 6.6 billion euros of bonds maturing in 2016,
2019 and 2022, more than the target for the sale of 4.5 billion
euros. The yields on the 2022 and 2019 securities declined,
while borrowing costs on the 2016 notes increased. S&P cut
Spain’s rating by two notches on Jan. 13.  Greece  Debt Swap  Greece’s government held a third day of talks with its
private creditors on a debt-swap deal to lower the country’s
borrowing and free up a second round of international aid. An
agreement was struck in October to implement a 50 percent cut in
the face value of Greek debt by voluntarily exchanging
outstanding bonds for new securities, with a goal of reducing
the Mediterranean nation’s borrowing to 120 percent of gross
domestic product by 2020. An accord with bondholders is key to a
second financing package for the cash-strapped country, which
faces a 14.5 billion-euro bond payment on March 20.  A report on Jan. 17 showed that  German investor confidence 
jumped by the most on record this month. The ZEW Center for
European Economic Research in Mannheim said its index of
investor and analyst expectations, which aims to predict
economic developments six months in advance, surged to minus
21.6 in January from minus 53.8 in December, the biggest gain
since the index started in December 1991. Economists had
forecast a reading of minus 49.4, the  median of 39 estimates  in
a Bloomberg News survey showed.  BMW, Daimler, Renault  BMW,  the world’s biggest luxury carmaker , rallied 8.8
percent. Daimler AG, the  third-largest maker of luxury vehicles ,
soared 11 percent and Renault SA rose 8.9 percent. Fiat SpA,
 Italy ’s biggest carmaker, jumped 14 percent. Automakers surged
8.9 percent this week for the best performance among the 19
industry groups on the  Stoxx 600 .  Banks rallied 8.7 percent the second-biggest advance among
Stoxx 600 groups. Barclays gained 11 percent, Societe Generale
jumped 29 percent and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA rose 11 percent.  Alstom SA surged 17 percent after predicting a rebound in
orders this quarter. An Israeli power-equipment project and
demand for rail carriages in  Latin America  allowed the French
manufacturer to stick to its profitability forecasts.  Carnival Shares Drop  Carnival tumbled 12 percent, its biggest weekly slide since
November 2008. The company halted advertising for its Carnival
Cruise Lines business at the start of the cruise industry’s peak
booking season. The company also announced a review of safety
and emergency procedures after the Costa Concordia, carrying
4,200 passengers and crew, ran aground off the coast of Tuscany.
Some 20 people are still missing and the ship’s captain is under
house arrest.  Essar Energy Plc slumped 28 percent after  India ’s  Supreme
Court  on Jan. 17 overturned an earlier ruling that allowed the
company’s Essar Oil Ltd. unit to defer the payment of  sales tax .  “Assuming Essar is required to repay the tax collected
immediately, we see an approximately $800 million cash
requirement,” Lucas Herrmann and James Brand, analysts at
Deutsche Bank AG in  London , said on Jan. 18 in a note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
