German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron discussed youth unemployment
in Europe and preparations for the upcoming informal European
Council meeting, according to a Downing Street spokesman.  Merkel called Cameron earlier today and they both agreed to
focus on improving the “functioning of national labor markets
in the European Union,” and use the “full potential of the
single market” to improve cross border trade, the spokesman
said in an emailed statement today.  They also discussed the talks between Israel and Palestine
following the visit by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to London and Berlin earlier this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
