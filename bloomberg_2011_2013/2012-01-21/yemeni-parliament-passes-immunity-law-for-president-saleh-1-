Yemen’s parliament passed a law
granting full immunity from prosecution to President Ali Abdullah Saleh after delaying the vote three times.  Saleh’s aides will receive immunity for “politically
motivated” crimes though they can be tried for acts of
terrorism, according to the provisions of the law agreed today
by the assembly. The parliament also endorsed the presidential
nomination of Vice President Abdurabu Mansur Hadi.  A new Yemeni government was sworn in last month after Saleh
signed an agreement brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council to
relinquish presidential powers in return for immunity from
prosecution. Hadi is running the state temporarily and will
transfer power to the opposition party after presidential
elections on Feb. 21, according to the agreement.  Saleh plans to travel to the U.S. after visiting Oman and
 Ethiopia , Sultan al-Barakani, assistant secretary general of the
General People’s Congress, said today in an interview. Saleh
will return to Yemen for the presidential elections, al-Barakani
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
