Tanzania will see increased
investment in gas exploration over the next five years, and the
industry could become a major source of revenue for the East
Africa nation by 2020, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  “Tanzania’s prospects of becoming a major producer of
natural gas by the end of the decade appear good,” the
Washington-based lender said in an e-mailed statement late
yesterday. “There could be large foreign direct investment
inflows over the next five years and a substantial increase in
exports and government revenue beginning around 2020.”  The country has two gas deposits in commercial production.
Songo Songo holds 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas, while Mnazi
Bay, near the border with  Mozambique , has 2 trillion cubic feet,
the state-run Tanzania Petroleum Development Corp. said in
October 2010.  Changes to some of the country’s policies are planned by
the government to ensure the expected increase in gas revenues
will support the economy, the IMF said.  “Successfully managing this future gas wealth will be
critical,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
