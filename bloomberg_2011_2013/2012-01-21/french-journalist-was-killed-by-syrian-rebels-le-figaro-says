The rocket that killed French
television journalist Gilles Jacquier Jan. 11 in Homs,  Syria ,
was fired by anti-government rebels and not security forces,  Le
Figaro  reported, citing interviews with rebel leaders.  Syrian army deserters have told Arab League observers they
fired the rocket by mistake, thinking they were attacking
soldiers loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, the French
newspaper said.  Jacquier, who worked for television station France 2, was
buried yesterday in his native village in the French Alps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
