Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) ’s pretax profit
may fall 40 percent to 130 billion yen ($1.7 billion) this year
as competition with Asian rivals and the stronger yen have
eroded margins, the Nikkei newspaper reported.  Earnings at domestic rivals JFE Holdings Inc. and Sumitomo
Metal Industries Ltd. will also probably decline by tens of
billions of yen, Nikkei  reported , without saying how it got the
information. Nippon Steel and JFE Holdings may lower their crude
steel production plans for fiscal 2011 by about 1 million tons
each, the report said.  Japanese  steel mills  are facing increased competition from
South Korean and Chinese rivals as the yen’s appreciation makes
domestic metal products more expensive. Nippon Steel received
regulatory approval in December to merge with  Sumitomo Metal  as
the government encourages takeovers to boost growth in the
world’s third-largest economy.  The company plans to book 84.6 billion yen in valuation
losses on securities holdings for the three months ended
December, it said on Jan. 5.  Japan ’s biggest steelmaker earlier cut its current profit
forecast by 22 percent to 180 billion yen for the year ending
March 31. Nippon Steel expects net income to total 85 billion
yen, down 8.8 percent from a year earlier.  Net income for fiscal 2011 may miss Nippon Steel’s forecast
if share prices don’t recover, Nikkei said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
