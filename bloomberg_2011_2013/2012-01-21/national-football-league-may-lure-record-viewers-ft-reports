The National Football League
championship game tomorrow will probably attract an
unprecedented number of viewers in the U.S., according to the
Financial Times newspaper.  An average of 36.6 million viewers watched each game of
last weekend’s divisional play-offs, a 4 percent increase from
2011, the FT said, citing data from Nielsen. The NFL signed
deals worth $24 billion in December, securing 10-year agreements
with its main broadcast partners including  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox and
 Comcast Corp.’s (CMCSA)  NBC, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
