German  bunds  fell the most since
November as the downgrade of nine euro-area nations by  Standard
& Poor’s  failed to damp demand at European debt sales this week,
giving investors less reason to buy the region’s safer assets.  German  two-year  yields climbed to a four-week high and
Italian bonds advanced amid speculation European officials are
moving closer to agreement on a planned fiscal treaty. Greece’s
benchmark 2022 bonds gained for a third week as officials
strived to reach an agreement with private creditors on a
voluntary debt swap.  “The ratings downgrades aren’t the ‘be all and end all,’”
said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “The market pre-empted
them so by the time they happened it was old news. The Greek
talks seem to be heading towards an agreement and the auctions
this week have been able to reach their required amount, so a
combination of factors have helped bund yields rise this week.”  Germany ’s 10-year  yield  rose 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, this week to 1.93 percent, the biggest
increase since the five days ended Nov. 25. The 2 percent bond
due January 2022 fell 1.495, or 14.95 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,293) face amount, to 100.63.  The two-year yield climbed five basis points to 0.21
percent after reaching 0.24 percent, the most since Dec. 23.  France , Spain  Bunds declined as borrowing costs fell at French and
Spanish debt sales. France auctioned 7.97 billion euros of
notes, just short of its maximum target, with the average yield
on the benchmark two-year notes sliding to 1.05 percent from
1.58 percent in October.  Spain  sold 6.61 billion euros of bonds
maturing in 2016, 2019 and 2022 on Jan. 19, exceeding the
maximum target of 4.5 billion euros.  S&P announced after financial markets shut on Jan. 13 that
it cut the credit ratings of France and Austria by one level to
AA+ and warned they may face further reductions. Italy,
 Portugal , and Spain were lowered by two steps.  The yield on Greece’s 5.9 percent bond maturing in October
2022 fell 21 basis points in the week even as two-year yields
set a record high of 189.88 percent. Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said yesterday that the talks on a second financing
package with European Commission,  European Central Bank  and
International Monetary Fund representatives were in their
“final phase.”  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italian 10-year
bonds over German bunds shrank to as narrow as 431 basis points,
the least since Dec. 12.  Budget Plan  A draft document showed European Union governments plan to
set tougher rules on budget deficits to restore credibility in
its attempts to tackle the debt crisis. The blueprint will be
discussed by EU finance ministers at a meeting on Jan. 23.  Germany and France are set to auction bills the same day,
with further debt sales by  Europe ’s largest economy, the
Netherlands, Spain and  Italy  in the following days.  Bunds have handed investors a loss of 0.2 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. French
bonds lost 0.2 percent, Greek debt is down 1.4 percent and
Italian bonds returned 2.7 percent, the indexes show.  -- Editors: Nicholas Reynolds, Paul Dobson  To contact the reporters on this story:
