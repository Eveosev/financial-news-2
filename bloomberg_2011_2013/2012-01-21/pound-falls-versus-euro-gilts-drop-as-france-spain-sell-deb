The pound posted its biggest weekly
decline against the euro in almost three months and gilts
dropped as French and Spanish borrowing costs fell at their
first debt auctions after their credit ratings were cut.  The yield on  10-year gilts  rose the most in four months as
demand for the relative safety of AAA government bonds eased
amid signs global growth hasn’t lost momentum. Reports this week
showed U.K. retail sales rebounded in December while U.S.
initial jobless claims fell to the least in almost four years.
Further advances in gilt yields may be limited next week before
a report predicted to show the U.K. economy contracted in the
fourth quarter of last year.  “There are worries that the U.K. economy is heading back
into recession,” said Michael Derks, chief strategist at FXPro
Financial Services Ltd. in London. “It would not be surprising
to see further weakness of the pound against euro in the near
term.”  The pound weakened 0.5 percent to 83.21 pence per euro at
5:40 p.m.  London  time yesterday, the biggest weekly drop since a
0.7 percent decline in the period ending Oct. 28. It gained 1.5
percent to 119.60 yen, snapping a three-week slide. Sterling
gained 1.4 percent to $1.5538.  The pound rose 1.6 percent in the past six months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The yen gained 7.7 percent and
the dollar advanced 6.7 percent.  The yield on the 10-year gilt climbed 14 basis points to
2.11 percent, the biggest gain since the five days ending Sept.
16.  U.K. gross domestic product fell 0.1 percent from the third
quarter, when it rose 0.6 percent, according to the median of 33
economist forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Debt Sales  France  sold 7.97 billion euros ($100.3 billion) of notes on
Jan. 19 with the average yield on the benchmark two-year notes
sliding to 1.05 percent from 1.58 percent in an October sale.
 Spain  issued 6.61 billion euros in bonds maturing in 2022, 2019
and 2016, more than its maximum target of 4.5 billion euros.  The sales came after S&P on Jan. 13 stripped France of its
AAA rating and cut Spain by two levels to A. The U.K. has the
top rating at all three main credit-rating companies.  The Debt Management Office plans to sell a 3.75 percent
gilt maturing in 2052 through banks next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
