Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  said any new debate over imposing losses on holders of
the country’s debt would be “fatal,”  Sueddeutsche Zeitung 
reported.  The newspaper quoted Noonan as saying Ireland’s debt load
would probably rise to 118 percent of gross domestic product, a
level that with a growing economy and higher tax receipts is
still “sustainable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
