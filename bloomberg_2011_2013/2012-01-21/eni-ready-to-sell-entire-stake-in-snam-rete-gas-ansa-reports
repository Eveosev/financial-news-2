Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s largest oil
company, is ready to sell its entire stake in  Snam Rete Gas SpA (SRG) ,
news agency Ansa reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Paolo Scaroni.
Eni aims to “get the most” from the  sale , Scaroni told
reporters in Libya, according to Ansa. He said he didn’t see
obstacles to reducing Eni’s stake to below 50 percent, the news
agency reported.  Eni’s production in Libya has returned to pre-war levels of
about 260,000 barrels a day, Ansa cited Scaroni as saying.  --
