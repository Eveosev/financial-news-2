Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti
and European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  both support
enlarging the capacity of Europe’s permanent financial rescue
mechanism,  Der Spiegel  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The news magazine said Monti is pushing for the European
Stability Mechanism’s capacity to be doubled to 1 trillion euros
($1.29 trillion), and had made the suggestion to the German
government.  Der Spiegel  added that Draghi supports the view that
unused funds from Europe’s temporary rescue fund should be added
to the ESM’s firepower when it comes into force.  To contact the reporter on this story:
