Demand for the  European Central
Bank ’s next three-year refinancing operation in February may be
lower than the 490 billion euros ($634 billion) lent to banks
last month, Bundesbank board member Joachim Nagel said,
according to  Sueddeutsche Zeitung .  Nagel added that the aim of the central bank is to ensure
enough liquidity is present in the banking system, and not to
guarantee that no European bank fails, the newspaper reported,
citing an interview with Nagel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
