Carlos Tevez  is unlikely to join
Paris Saint-Germain from Manchester City, the Guardian said.  Tevez’s agent Kai Joorabchian held his first meeting with
PSG officials and the breaking point in a deal is the club’s
idea on how to move forward is different from how Tevez wants
his career to progress, the Guardian said.  Inter Milan and AC Milan, who’ve both failed in attempts to
sign the striker, may now re-enter the market, the newspaper
said.  Tevez has not played since being suspended in September
after City manager Roberto Mancini said he refused to enter a
game against  Bayern Munich  as a substitute. He is currently in
his native Argentina.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
