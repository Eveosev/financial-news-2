Refined copper  imports  by  China 
surged to a record in December, narrowing the second annual
decline, as consumers built inventories ahead of a seasonal
increase in demand.  Arrivals jumped 78 percent from a year ago to 406,937
metric tons, rising for a seventh month, according to an e-
mailed statement from the General Administration of Customs
today. That was the highest on record, according to Wang Zhouyi,
an analyst at  Shanghai  CIFCO Futures Co.  Surging imports, coupled with a rebound in domestic
production, have swelled inventories in Shanghai for a seventh
week and widened the local cash discount. Three-month copper on
the London Metal Exchange advanced to $8,428.5 a ton yesterday,
the highest in four months, after retreating 21 percent in 2011.  “There are wide expectations that the market will warm up
after the Chinese New Year holiday, as spring is usually when
demand picks up,” said Wang. Still, “as prices continue to
climb, we’ll have to wait to see how downstream demand reacts.”  Refined copper imports fell 3 percent to 2.84 million tons
last year, after dropping 8.4 percent to 2.92 million tons in
2010, data from the customs office showed.  Output in the world’s largest user gained for the first
time in four months in December, rising 8 percent from a year
ago to 457,000 tons, as more raw material supplies prompted
smelters to meet their yearly production targets.  Surging Inventories  Copper  stockpiles  monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed 11,193 this week to 131,645 tons, a nine-month
high, bourse data showed yesterday.  “A strong set of preliminary Chinese trade data helped to
soften market concerns regarding a slowing in demand, and recent
economic data have suggested that the probability of a hard
landing is declining at a fast pace,” said  Barclays Capital  in
a research report yesterday.  China reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter economic
data last week. Gross domestic product expanded 8.9 percent in
the fourth quarter, more than a Bloomberg News survey for 8.7
percent. Industrial production climbed 12.8 percent from a year
ago in December, exceeding a forecast of 12.3 percent.  “Concerns remain regarding whether copper imports in
particular will contract sharply in early 2012,” analysts at
Barclays said in the report.  The metal for immediate delivery on Shanghai’s Changjiang
market was quoted at a discount of about 350 yuan a ton
yesterday to the front-month Shanghai futures contract. Markets
in China will be closed during the week of Jan. 23 for the
Chinese New Year holidays.  Scrap  imports  in December climbed 2.7 percent from a year
ago to 446,819 tons, and full year arrivals gained 7.4 percent
to 4.69 million tons, according to the customs.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
