Farmland prices may be supported by
gains in commodity demand and limited supplies available for
sale, even as U.S. economic growth remains slow, said Joel
Hertz, the chairman of Hertz Farm Management.  Improving technology and equipment has allowed farmers to
plant more land faster, while industry consolidation means land
doesn’t turn over as quickly, Hertz said in a speech at the
Allendale agriculture outlook conference in Crystal Lake,
 Illinois .  World population growth and rising demand in  Asia  may
support commodity prices long term, he said.  “If you ask me is it time to purchase land, I would say,
yes,” Hertz said. “The future of agriculture is very bright.
Even though we’re looking for a downturn in land prices, it’s
not going to go down very far.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
