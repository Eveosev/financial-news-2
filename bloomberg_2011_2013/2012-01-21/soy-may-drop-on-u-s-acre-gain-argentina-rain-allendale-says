Soybean prices may decline as U.S.
farmers boost planting this year, while rains in  South America 
may improve prospects for crops that have suffered from dry
weather, said Steve Georgy, a broker manager at Allendale Inc.  U.S. farmers may plant about 76.008 million acres in
soybeans this year, up from 74.976 million last year, Georgy
said at Allendale’s annual outlook conference in Crystal Lake,
 Illinois . With average yields, that may leave U.S. production at
3.299 billion bushels, he said.  Areas of  Argentina  may get as much as 2.5 inches (6.4
centimeters) of rain by Jan. 23, while storms next week may
bring as much as 1 inch to parts of Brazil, forecaster Telvent
DTN said yesterday in a report.  “With an increase in South America, and if we’re looking
at an increase as well, things could go downhill,” Georgy said.
“These rains that are coming in are extremely important right
now for  Brazil , Argentina and South America as a whole. We could
still see a very good crop from South America.”  Soybean futures at $10.20 a bushel may represent a fair-
value price, he said. March soybeans closed at $11.87 a bushel
yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade, up 5.9 percent since
mid-December as concern mounted that dry weather would cut
yields on South American crops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
