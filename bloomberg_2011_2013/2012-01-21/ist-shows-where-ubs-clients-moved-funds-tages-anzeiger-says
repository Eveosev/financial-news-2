A secret list shows to which banks
 UBS AG (UBSN) ’s U.S. clients transferred their money, Tages-Anzeiger
reported, without saying where it got the information.  UBS spokesman Serge Steiner said the bank hasn’t handed
over “institution-specific” information to the U.S., according
to the report in today’s  newspaper . Tobias Lux, a spokesman for
the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, would neither
confirm nor deny that the organization had transferred such
data.  A UBS spokesperson couldn’t be immediately reached by
Bloomberg News by phone for comment. Lux didn’t immediately
respond to phone and e-mail requests for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
