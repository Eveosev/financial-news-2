Francesco Schettino, captain of the
Costa Concordia vessel that ran aground a week ago, told
magistrates that he spoke to Costa Crociere SpA 10 times to
tell the  Carnival Corp. (CCL)  unit what had happened,  Corriere della
Sera  reported.  Schettino said he spoke to the person responsible for the
crisis unit and asked for helicopters and tugboats because he
thought the damage could be repaired, according to the Italian
newspaper. He said he started to prepare for an evacuation and
didn’t want to cause panic, according to Corriere. Schettino
also told magistrates he thought the vessel would be pushed
closer to the shore where it would have been easier to
disembark, the daily newspaper reported.  Schettino’s lawyer and Grosseto’s prosecutor didn’t answer
calls seeking comment. Costa Crociere declined to comment beyond
Chairman Pier Luigi Foschi’s remarks made on Italian state
television yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
