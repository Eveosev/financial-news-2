Marc Grossman , the U.S. special
envoy for  Afghanistan  and Pakistan, arrived in Kabul to hold
talks with Afghan President  Hamid Karzai  on preliminary peace
negotiations with the Taliban.  “Mr. Grossman will hold talks with President Karzai this
afternoon on the Taliban reconciliation and peace process, the
U.S. long-term partnership and a few other Afghan-U.S. related
issues,” Eimal Faizi, Karzai’s spokesman, said by phone.
“Afghanistan wants the peace process with the Taliban to be led
by Afghanistan, not by any other countries, including the U.S.”  The Taliban last month said it was ready to open a liaison
office in Qatar to hold talks with the U.S. and its allies to
end the decade-long war in Afghanistan.  Grossman’s visit to Kabul comes a day after an Afghan
soldier fatally shot four French soldiers and wounded 17 others
in Kapisa province in northeastern Afghanistan.  France  in
response suspended operations with the Afghan army throughout
the country.  “The United States stands ready to assist in any way we
can an Afghan-led reconciliation process to find a peaceful end
to this conflict,” Grossman said today in a statement released
by the U.S. embassy in Kabul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
