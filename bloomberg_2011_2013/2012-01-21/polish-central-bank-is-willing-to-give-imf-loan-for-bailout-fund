Poland ’s central bank is willing to
grant a loan to the  International Monetary Fund , the bank’s
management board said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  The Narodowy Bank Polski will participate in “temporarily
increasing the IMF’s financial resources in the form of a
bilateral loan” after a Jan. 16 request to that effect from the
 Finance Ministry , the bank said in a statement.  European leaders seeking to tame a sovereign debt and
banking crisis pledged in December to channel 150 billion euros
($194 billion) to the IMF to help stabilize the economy and
shore up investor confidence in the 17-nation bloc using the
common currency.  The board will discuss the issue with the bank’s rate-
setting Monetary Policy Council on Jan. 24, the bank said. The
bank did not give details on the amount or time frame of the
loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
