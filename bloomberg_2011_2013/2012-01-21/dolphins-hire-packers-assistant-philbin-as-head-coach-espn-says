Green Bay  Packers offensive
coordinator Joe Philbin will become the next head coach of the
Miami Dolphins, ESPN reported.  The hiring would come less than two weeks after Philbinâ€™s
21-year-old son, Michael T. Philbin, was found dead in a frozen
river in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.  ESPN, which based its report on information from an
anonymous person connected with the  National Football League ,
said the Dolphins will hold a news conference tomorrow. Dolphins
spokesman Harvey Greene did not immediately respond to an e-
mail.  Philbin, 50, has been with Green Bay since 2003 and has
been offensive coordinator since 2007. He would replace Tony Sparano, who was fired by the Dolphins on Dec. 12 after
compiling a 29-33 record in three-plus seasons and was hired by
the  New York Jets  as offensive coordinator on Jan. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
