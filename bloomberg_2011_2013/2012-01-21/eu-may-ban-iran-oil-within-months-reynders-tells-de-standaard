The European Union may ban Iranian
oil imports within a few months, while ensuring the embargo
doesn’t hurt the region’s economy and international security,
Belgian Foreign Minister  Didier Reynders  told  De Standaard .  The phase-in period for the embargo should be as short as
possible, Reynders told the newspaper in an  interview  published
today. The EU can implement it in such a way so that oil
supplies are not compromised and prices remain under control, he
said, according to De Standaard.  Foreign ministers from the 27-nation EU are due to discuss
sanctions on Iran and decide about the timing of the potential
ban at their Jan. 23 gathering in Brussels. Any decision to
impose an embargo would have to be unanimous.  The embargo would include a temporary exemption for
existing contracts to enable countries such as Greece, Italy and
 Spain  to find alternative supplies, with most countries backing
a Danish proposal of moving to a full embargo from July 1, EU
diplomats said earlier this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
