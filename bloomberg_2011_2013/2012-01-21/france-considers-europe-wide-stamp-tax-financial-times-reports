France  may back a U.K.-style stamp
duty on share purchases as an initial step for a financial
transaction tax that covers the European Union, the Financial
Times newspaper said.  France considers the tax a potential option as the levy
already exists in the U.K., according to the report, citing an
unidentified French official. It follows comments from German
Economy Minister Philipp Roesler that the stamp duty is an
alternative to the financial transaction tax and a way to
overcome resistance from the U.K., the FT said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
