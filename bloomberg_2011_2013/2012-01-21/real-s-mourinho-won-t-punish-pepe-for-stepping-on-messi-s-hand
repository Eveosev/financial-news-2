Real Madrid manager  Jose Mourinho 
said he won’t punish defender Pepe for stepping on the hand of
Barcelona’s  Lionel Messi .  The incident occurred during Barcelona’s 2-1 away win in
the first leg of the Copa del Rey quarterfinal three days ago.
The Brazilian apologized to Messi the next day in a statement on
Real’s website and said his action was unintentional.  Mourinho said he accepted his player’s explanation and
included him in the squad list for tomorrow’s game against
Athletic Bilbao.  “Pepe apologized and that’s enough for me,” Mourinho said
today on Real’s website. “I’d only be angry if Pepe publically
said what he did was unintentional after admitting privately
that it was.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
