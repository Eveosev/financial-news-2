The Financial Services Authority is
pressuring banks to curb their bonus pools to compensate for
losses spurred by mis-selling payment-protection insurance to
customers, the Financial Times newspaper said.  The regulator wants banks to recognize the multibillion
compensation payments for PPI insurance used to cover payments
on credit cards and mortgages in case of illness or
unemployment, as they assess 2011 payouts for bankers, the
newspaper said citing an unidentified person familiar with the
talks. The discussions with the FSA come as banks plan to pay
out large sums to their employees despite calls to curb bonuses
from politicians and lawmakers, the report said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
