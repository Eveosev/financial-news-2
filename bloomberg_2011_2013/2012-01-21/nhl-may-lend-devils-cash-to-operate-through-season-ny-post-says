The  National Hockey League  is in
talks with the  New Jersey Devils  to loan the team money so it
can operate through the season, the New York Post reported.  Under the league’s plan, Devils controlling owner Jeffrey
Vanderbeek would continue to run the team as he looks for a
long-term financial solution, the Post said, citing sources it
didn’t identify.  The Devils must meet payroll twice a month until the
regular season ends April 7, the Post said. The team is on
course to lose up to $20 million this season, the newspaper
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
