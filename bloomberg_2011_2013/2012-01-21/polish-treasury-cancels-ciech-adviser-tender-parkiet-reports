Poland’s Treasury canceled a tender
to find an adviser for the sale of chemical company  Ciech SA (CIE) ,
Parkiet reported, citing the ministry.  It is in the public interest to sell the government’s stake
in Ciech at the “most advantageous price” and the current
economic situation is too “volatile and unpredictable” to
guarantee this, the newspaper cited the Treasury as saying. The
state owns 38.7 percent of Ciech, according to the company’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
