Green Bay  Packers offensive
coordinator Joe Philbin has been hired as the next head coach of
the National Football League’s Miami Dolphins, General Manager
Jeff Ireland said.  The hiring comes less than two weeks after Philbin’s 21-
year-old son, Michael T. Philbin, was found dead in a river in
Oshkosh, Wisconsin.  “The Dolphins have a strong nucleus to build around, and
working with everyone in the organization, I know that together
we will return the team to its winning tradition,” Philbin said
last night in a statement.  Philbin, 50, has been with Green Bay since 2003 and has
been offensive coordinator since 2007. He replaces Tony Sparano,
who was fired by the Dolphins on Dec. 12 after compiling a 29-33
record in three-plus seasons and was hired by the  New York Jets 
as offensive coordinator on Jan. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
