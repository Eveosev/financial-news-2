Munster beat the Northampton Saints
51-36 to secure the top seed for the quarterfinals of rugby’s
Heineken Cup.  Simon Zebo scored three tries and  Ronan O’Gara  kicked 24
points for Munster, which won all six of its games in Pool 1.
The six pool winners plus the two best second-place teams
advance to the final eight of  Europe ’s top club competition.  Clermont Auvergne won Pool 4 with a 19-15 win over Ulster,
which qualified as one of the best runners-up. Defending
champion Leinster, which had already won Pool 1, was guaranteed
a home quarterfinal with a 25-3 rout of Montpellier.  Record four-time champion Toulouse was beaten 34-24 last
night by Gloucester, but won Pool 6 after Connacht upset
Harlequins 9-8. Tomorrow’s four games will determine the winners
in Pools 2 and 5, along with the remaining second-place
qualifier for the quarterfinals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
