Pakistan  decided to ease rules on
 capital gains  tax to revive trading volumes hit by the
imposition of the levy.  “We agree on proposal of the stock exchange to support
activity and positive growth,” Abdul Hafeez Shaikh, finance
minister, said during a visit to the Karachi Stock Exchange
today. The decision applies from April 1.  The  Karachi Stock Exchange  suggested that the existing two
tax bands be cut to a single flat rate, and that the levy be
paid after it is calculated and certified by the National
Clearing Company of Pakistan Ltd.  Pakistan introduced a tax on capital gains on share
purchases from July 1, 2010. It requires investors to pay a 10
percent levy if stocks are held for less than six months and 7.5
percent if held for six to 12 months. Average daily volume
slumped to 60 million shares last year from 108 million in 2010
and 169.14 million in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
