Japan may exempt home purchases from
any increase in its  sales tax , or reduce the amount of increase,
Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  said.  Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda aims to double the 5 percent
sales tax by 2015 to boost revenue and contain a public debt
burden twice the size of Japan’s annual economic output. The
legislation needs approval of parliament, and Azumi and two
deputy ministers are today meeting with taxpayers in three
cities to explain the need for a tax increase.  Raising the sales tax would be the first step toward
reducing the nation’s public debt and reforming finances, Azumi
said today in the quake-stricken northern city of Sendai.  The government forecasts public debt will exceed 1
quadrillion yen ($13 trillion) in the year ending March. The
 International Monetary Fund  has recommended raising the sales
tax gradually to 15 percent over several years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
