Occupy  London  anti-capitalist
protesters said they moved into an abandoned office building in
Britain’s main financial district until the City of London
Corporation publishes its finances.  The protesters are in Roman House in the Barbican area of
in London, they said in an e-mailed statement today. The City of
London Corporation oversees Britain’s main financial district in
the U.K. capital.  “The Corporation has undermined our democracy through the
power of its lobbyists and must submit to public scrutiny,”
supporter Bryn Philips said in the statement. “If the City
agrees to publish its City Cash Accounts, future and historic,
we will leave the building immediately. If it does not, we will
take appropriate action until such time as it does.”  The City of London is “disappointed” by the protests, a
spokesman said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
