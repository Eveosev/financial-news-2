Essar Group wants Vodafone Group Plc
to refund the $883 million that it withheld to pay Indian
authorities as a tax when the U.K. phone operator bought a 22
percent stake in Vodafone Essar Ltd., the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.  Two of Essar’s Mauritius-based units will apply for the
refund within months, the newspaper reported. Essar
Communications Ltd. and Essar Com Ltd. sold their 22 percent
stake in Vodafone Essar to the British company for $3.32
billion, as part of a larger deal in which Vodafone bought
Essar’s total 33 percent stake in Vodafone Essar, the Journal
said. The company is now called Vodafone  India  Ltd.  India’s  Supreme Court  ruled yesterday that Vodafone doesn’t
have to pay the government $2.2 billion in taxes for its 2007
purchase of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.’s India operations.  Manish Kedia, a Mumbai-based spokesman for the Essar Group,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
