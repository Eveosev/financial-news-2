Saudi Arabian shares gained the most
in 12 weeks after the country’s second-largest phone company
posted fourth-quarter earnings that beat estimates.  Etihad Etisalat Co. (EEC) , which trades as Mobily, advanced to
its highest closing price in almost a year after reporting
quarterly profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  Saudi Basic
Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s largest petrochemicals maker,
gained the most in six weeks.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  jumped 1.4 percent to 6,464.17
at the close in Riyadh, the gauge’s biggest increase since Oct.
29. More than three shares climbed for every one that dropped.  “With the earnings season over, investors are digesting
the results and adjusting positions on future expectations,”
said Asim Bukhtiar, an equity analyst at Riyad Capital.
“Better-than-expected results announced last Wednesday are
lifting the telecoms.”  Mobily rallied 3.7 percent to 55.75 Saudi riyals, its
highest price since Jan. 26, 2011. The Riyadh-based company said
after the close of the Saudi market on Jan. 18 that fourth-
quarter profit climbed 16 percent to 1.7 billion riyals ($453
million) as revenue from data services increased. That beat the
 mean estimate  of nine analysts who forecast a profit of 1.48
billion riyals. The company said it plans to pay a dividend of 2
riyals a share for the second half.  Sabic contributed the most to  the index’s rally , adding 1.6
percent to 93.25 riyals.  Al-Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , the kingdom’s largest
publicly traded lender by assets, increased for a second day,
gaining 1.1 percent to 72.50 riyals.  Saudi Arabia ’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
that opens on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
