The 17 nations using the euro must
cooperate more closely and prevent any country defaulting on its
debt as that would jeopardize the region’s healthy economies,
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said.  “No country should be allowed to default because if any
country defaults, it is going to hurt overall confidence, and
would open the door for more countries to follow the same
route,” Babacan said at a press conference in Warsaw today.
“It would increase the risk premium of the whole euro zone, and
even those countries that have relatively healthy public
finances would be hurt.”  Exports (TUTBALBN)  to the euro area are important for the Turkish
economy, Babacan said, adding that the government may have to
lower its 4 percent growth forecast for this year if the
situation in the currency bloc worsens. European Union finance
ministers will discuss tougher rules on budget deficits at a
meeting on Jan. 23, according to a draft of a planned fiscal
treaty obtained by Bloomberg News.  “All the countries in the euro zone need to do their
homework,” Babacan said. “But there also needs to be a
stronger framework for common fiscal policy -- a situation in
which there are 17 countries using one currency but with 17
fiscal policy strategies is not sustainable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
