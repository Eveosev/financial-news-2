Italy ’s bonds slumped, pushing the
10-year yield to the highest relative to German bunds this year,
as Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani said there was no
chance of a broad coalition to end a political deadlock.  Italian  five-year yields  jumped the most in a month as
demand declined when the Treasury sold 6.91 billion euros ($8.84
billion) of debt at an auction today. Spanish and Greek bonds
also slid as investors shunned the securities of so-called
peripheral nations. Bersani was rejected by leaders ofBeppe Grillo’s Five Star Movement after talks aimed at forming a
governing coalition that was broadcast live on the Internet.
German  10-year yields  fell to the lowest in three months.  “It’s a combination of the political uncertainty
coinciding with an auction that’s put Italian bonds under
pressure,” said Jamie Searle, a fixed-income strategist at
Citigroup Inc. in  London . “The auctions weren’t the strongest
and that’s meant Italian bonds continue to struggle post supply.
Italian yields are likely to face upward pressure heading into
the second quarter until there’s a much clearer resolution of
the uncertainty.”  Italy’s  10-year yield  climbed 21 basis points, or 0.21
percentage point, to 4.78 percent at 5 p.m. London time, up from
4.50 percent at the end of last year. The 5.5 percent bond
maturing in November 2022 fell 1.625, or 16.25 euros per 1,000-
euro face amount, to 105.92.  The extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of 10-year bunds widened as much as 29 basis points to
351 basis points, the most since Dec. 11.  ‘Vote ‘No”  “The decision for the Senate was to vote ‘no’ to a
Democratic Party confidence vote for a government led by
Bersani,” Vito Crimi, head of Five Star’s contingent in the
upper house, told reporters after leaving the negotiating table.  Bersani, who’s struggling to get backing in the legislature
after the Feb. 24-25 vote produced a hung parliament, may report
back to President Giorgio Napolitano tomorrow or March 29 on
whether he has enough support to form a government, a party
spokeswoman said. The election gave Bersani a majority in the
lower house, while leaving the Senate divided. Bersani has the
biggest bloc in the upper house, with former premier Silvio Berlusconi second and Five Star third.  Italy’s  five-year yield  jumped 25 basis points to 3.58
percent, the biggest increase since Feb. 26.  Italian Auction  Investors submitted bids for 1.33 times the 3 billion euros
of 10-year bonds the Italian Treasury sold today, down from 1.65
times at the previous auction on Feb. 27. The bid-to-cover ratio
for the 3.91 billion euros of five-year notes fell to 1.22 times
from 1.61 times. Italy sold the new five-year securities at a
yield of 3.65 percent, the highest since Oct. 30.  Lack of demand at the auction coupled with near-term
political uncertainty should see Italian 10-year yields climbing
toward 5.15 percent,  Andy Chaytor  a strategist at Nomura
International Plc in London, wrote in a note to clients.  German bonds led gains in the securities of  Europe ’s core
nations as investors sought safer assets. The 10-year bund yield
dropped seven basis points to 1.27 percent, the lowest level
since Dec. 10.  Germany ’s two-year yields declined three basis points to
minus 0.02 percent. A negative yield means investors who hold
the security until it matures will receive less than they paid
to buy it.  Spanish Bonds  Spanish bonds declined as the government increased its
estimate for last year’s budget deficit.  The budget shortfall was 6.98 percent of gross domestic
product, excluding aid to the country’s banking industry,
instead of the previously estimated 6.74 percent, Deputy Budget
Minister Marta Fernandez Curras said in  Madrid .  Spain ’s  10-year yield  rose 14 basis points to 5.08 percent,
the highest level since March 18.  Cyprus’s bonds fell for the fifth day, with the yield on
the 4.625 percent security due in February 2020 rising 154 basis
points to 15.40 percent. The bid price was 56.27 and the offer
price was 59.985.  Cyprus may announce what type of capital controls it plans
to implement today as its leaders seek to prevent cash outflows
when the nation’s banks reopen tomorrow. Lenders have been
closed since a plan by the European Union to force losses on
some bondholders and depositors in exchange for a 10 billion-
euro bailout.  Capital controls, which will be in place for seven days to
curb outflow of deposits, may include a ban on cashing checks
and carrying cash of more than 3,000 euros across the border,
Nicosia-based Phileleftheros reported, citing a draft  Finance
Ministry  decree.  Greek Bonds  Greek bonds tumbled, with  10-year yields  rising as much as
91 basis points to 13.04 percent, the highest since Dec. 20.  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of the Netherlands and Italy,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Slovenian dollar-denominated bonds slid for a second day on
concern banking woes caused by bad loans will trigger a bailout
request. The yield on the 5.5 percent securities due in October
2022 climbed 64 basis points to 6.39 percent.  Italian bonds returned 0.7 percent this quarter through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities gained 3.6 percent and German bunds rose 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
