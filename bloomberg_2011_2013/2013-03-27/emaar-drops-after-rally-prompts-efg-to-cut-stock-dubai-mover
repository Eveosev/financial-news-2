Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  fell the most
in more than seven weeks after EFG-Hermes Holding SAE cut the
stock to neutral from buy as it said a surge in the shares may
be overdone given the outlook for international operations.  The shares of the developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper decreased 3.6 percent, the most since Feb. 3, to 5.07
dirhams at the close in Dubai. Emaar was the  biggest  decliner
and most traded on the benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI) , which
slumped 1.6 percent to 1,836.71, the weakest since Jan. 28.  “The Dubai recovery is already priced in,” Cairo-based
EFG-Hermes analysts Jan Pawel Hasman and Shaza El Kady said in a
note dated yesterday. “Going forward, Emaar’s growth is likely
to depend on its ability to replicate its existing Dubai
experience internationally, which could prove challenging.”  Emaar has surged 35 percent this year, making it the  second
best-performing stock  on Dubai’s stock index, as it benefits
from a property recovery in the emirate that was on the brink of
default in 2009. The company is seeking to diversify revenue
with plans to expand in  Egypt  and  Iraq . Emaar, which also
operates in  China , Pakistan and  Syria , derived  28 percent of
 sales from outside of the U.A.E. in the fourth quarter,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sentiment Driven  Despite cutting its recommendation, EFG-Hermes raised the
price estimate on the stock to 6 dirhams from 5.15 dirhams,
citing Emaar’s recurring income. Emaar is poised to report a 5
percent increase in 2013 earnings after an advance of 18 percent
 last year , according to the mean estimate of 12 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. The stock’s  50-day volatility  rose to 33
today, the highest since April, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The sentiment-driven market is likely to become
increasingly erratic, and the stock’s volatility could increase
in the medium term,” Hasman and El Kady said.  Dubai announced in November plans to develop a new district
with the world’s largest mall, 100 hotels and gardens larger
than  London ’s Hyde Park, which Emaar will co-develop. That
followed plans to form a joint venture with Iraq to help develop
and manage housing projects in the country as well as a deal
with Al-Futtaim Group to develop Cairo Gate, a project valued at
5 billion Egyptian pounds ($735 million).  Ten  analysts  recommend investors buy the developer’s
shares, while five say hold them and one says sell, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
