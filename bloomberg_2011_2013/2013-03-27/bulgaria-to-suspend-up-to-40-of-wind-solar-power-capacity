Bulgaria  may suspend as much as 40
percent of wind and solar power capacity as part of its effort
to stem oversupply and stabilize electricity generation  About 40 percent of wind and solar power producers aren’t
providing real-time information to the country’s central
electricity dispatcher, jeopardizing the safety of Bulgaria’s
transmission network, Energy Minister Asen Vasilev said in a
document posted on the ministry’s website. They will be
temporarily disconnected, he said.  Bulgaria’s grid is suffering from power overloads caused by
a rapid increase in wind and solar capacity coupled with
decreasing domestic consumption in the face of a weak economy.
The government wants to relax the restrictions on electricity
trading with neighboring  Turkey , according to the document.  Protests against high electricity bills and poverty toppled
the government of Boyko Borissov on Feb. 20. President Rosen Plevneliev appointed an interim government led by Prime Minister
Marin Raikov on March 12 to organize and hold early elections on
May 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
