Giovanni di Stefano, an Italian who
acted as defense attorney for  Saddam Hussein  and former Serbian
leader  Slobodan Milosevic , was convicted on money laundering,
fraud and deception charges by a London court.  Di Stefano claimed to be a lawyer for more than eight years
in “order to line his own pockets,” U.K. prosecutors said in a
statement today. He was charged in March 2011 with stealing a
BMW and lying about his legal qualifications.  “This was fraud by anyone’s standards,” Hilary Ryan, from
the Crown Prosecution Service’s organized crime division, said
in the e-mailed press release. “Giovanni Di Stefano routinely
tricked his clients and abused their trust.”  Di Stefano, who frequently traveled to Iraq during cases
that resulted in Hussein being hanged in 2006, also represented
former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister  Tariq Aziz  and former Iraqi
Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan. He earlier represented U.K.
physician Harold Shipman, known as “Doctor Death” because he
murdered at least 215 of his patients over 23 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
