Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK) , which cost
taxpayers about 21 billion euros ($27 billion) to rescue, said
its annual loss widened as a decline in bad loan losses failed to
offset dwindling gains from buying back its own debt.  The net loss increased to 3.65 billion euros in 2012 from
2.31 billion euros in the year-earlier period, the nation’s
second-largest lender by assets said in a statement today. Bad
loan provisions fell 70 percent to 2.53 billion euros last year.
The 2.1 billion-euro gain from buying back junior bonds at a
discount in 2011 wasn’t repeated.  “AIB has now largely completed the restructuring phase of
its strategic plan as the bank targets a return to sustainable
profitability and growth during 2014,” Chief Executive Officer
 David Duffy  said in the statement.  Duffy, who has held the job for almost 16 months, is
implementing more than 2,500 job cuts, cutting executives’ pay
and selling loans to help return the lender to profit and attract
investors in 2014. Allied Irish plans to restructure almost all
of its troubled residential mortgages by the end of year, Duffy
said in an interview last month.  The bank is beginning to offer struggling borrowers split
mortgages, where repayments on a portion of the loan are put on
hold until the debtor’s circumstances improve, and the lender
writes off irrecoverable loans, he has said.  The pace of arrears growth in the Irish mortgage book
“slowed when compared with 2012,”  Allied Irish  said, echoing
comments from other lenders, such as Bank of Ireland Plc and
Permanent TSB Group Plc, within the past month.  Mortgage Arrears  By value, the level of Irish owner-occupier residential
mortgages at least 90 days in arrears rose to 14.9 percent at the
end of 2012 from 10.8 percent a year earlier. Buy-to-let loans
behind in repayments increased to 43.6 percent from 31.3 percent,
the bank said.  While Allied Irish’s net interest margin, the difference
between the rates at which it funds itself and lends to
customers, narrowed to 0.91 percent from 1.03 percent in the
year-earlier period, it expanded in the fourth quarter from to
the previous three months. The margin has contracted from 2.21
percent in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
