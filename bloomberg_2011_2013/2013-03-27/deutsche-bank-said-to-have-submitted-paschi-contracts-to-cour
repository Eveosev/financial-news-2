Deutsche Bank AG voluntarily
submitted documents to Siena prosecutors that relate to its
derivative transaction with Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA,
a deal the Italian lender used to mask losses, according to two
people with direct knowledge of the case.  Deutsche Bank’s lawyers met with Siena prosecutors on March
22 to discuss the transaction, dubbed Project Santorini, the
people said, asking not to be identified because the talks were
private. The German bank, which isn’t under investigation, gave
prosecutors official documents on the trade, including
contracts, one of the people said.  A Deutsche Bank official declined to comment.  Siena prosecutors are probing former managers of  Monte
Paschi (BMPS)  for alleged obstruction of regulatory activity, market
manipulation and false bookkeeping. In Project Santorini, a
transaction never fully disclosed to investors, the bank made a
money-losing bet on the country’s government bonds while hiding
losses on an existing derivative,  Bloomberg News  first reported
on Jan. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
