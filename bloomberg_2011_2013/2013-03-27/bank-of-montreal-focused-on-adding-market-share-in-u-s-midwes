Bank of Montreal , Canada’s fourth-
largest lender by assets, is focused on building its U.S.
consumer-lending business in the Midwest, executive Mark Furlong
said.  “Our focus would be getting bigger in Indianapolis,
Minneapolis,  St. Louis  and Kansas City, so that we can grow name
recognition and grow share of market there,” Furlong, who
oversees Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank, said today at a
conference in  Montreal  hosted by National Bank Financial.  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  is expanding on its C$4.1 billion ($4
billion)  takeover  of Wisconsin lender Marshall & Ilsley Corp.,
which doubled the Toronto-based bank’s U.S. deposits and
branches after the deal was completed in July 2011. The firm is
concentrating on internal growth by opening more branches and
increasing sales, Furlong said.  “Some of those markets I’ve mentioned we’ll have to do
some acquisitions to augment what we have, but the focus is on
the core business,” Furlong said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
