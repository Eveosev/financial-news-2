Gasoline fluctuated after a report
that inventories declined last week and as the dollar gained
versus the euro, reducing the appeal of commodities.  Futures swung between gains and losses as a bailout of
Cyprus and political deadlock in  Italy  weakened the euro. The
industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  reported that
 gasoline stockpiles  fell 2.03 million barrels last week while
crude supplies rose 3.74 million barrels. The government will
report on inventories today. Marathon Petroleum Corp. idled its
Canton, Ohio, refinery for 30 days of planned work.  “The market is nervous over Europe and the bigger-than-
expected build in crude from the API,” said  Phil Flynn , senior
market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “It got a
little bit of a pop off Marathon Canton and now it’s waiting on
the EIA report and headlines out of Europe about the stability
of the banks.”  Gasoline for April delivery rose 0.06 cent to $3.1112 a
gallon at 9:54 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, after
swinging between $3.1068 and $3.1307. Trading volume was 15
percent below the 100-day average for the time of day.  The euro dropped as much as 0.8 percent against the dollar
to a four-month low.  The EIA will probably say that gasoline supplies fell 1
million barrels last week, inventories of distillates declined
850,000 barrels and crude stockpiles rose 1.33 million,
according to the median of 12 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The report is scheduled to be released at 10:30 a.m.
in  Washington .  Heating oil for April delivery rose 0.01 cent to $2.8814 a
gallon on volume that was 38 percent below the 100-day average.  Gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.8 cent to
$3.65 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices have
dropped for the past seven days and are 24.8 cents below a year
ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
