Television analyst Tim McCarver,
who called 23 World Series and 20 All-Star Games in a 55-year
career in  Major League Baseball , will step down from his
broadcasting position at Fox Sports after this season.  McCarver, 71, announced the decision on a conference call.
He said that while he is healthy and still feels passion for
baseball, “it’s time to cut back.”  “I am very proud to have been a part of all the things
that make this game so special for all of us who follow it day-
to-day, week-to-week and year-to-year,” he said on the call.  McCarver’s baseball career began in 1959 as a catcher for
the  St. Louis Cardinals , with whom he won World Series titles in
1964 and 1967. As a broadcaster he has worked 28 consecutive MLB
playoffs on  network television  and has been part of Fox’s lead
broadcasting team alongside play-by-play analyst Joe Buck since
1996.  McCarver said he has not yet decided if he might work
occasional games in the future.  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
