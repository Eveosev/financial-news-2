Hog futures fell, halting the
longest rally in nine months, on speculation that U.S.
meatpacker purchases are slowing before the holiday weekend.
Cattle were little changed.  Wholesale- pork  prices slid 0.5 percent to 77.59 cents a
pound yesterday, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
Meatpackers processed 844,000 hogs in the first two days of this
week, down 0.9 percent from a week earlier, government data
show. Some meatpacking plants will be closed on March 29 in
observance of the Good Friday holiday.  “It’s going to be a slow week in the livestock,” Lawrence Kane, a market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group in  Yates City ,
 Illinois , said in a telephone interview. “We’ve got a packer
who’s not real interested in having a lot of animals for the
weekend.”  Hog futures for June settlement declined 1.2 percent to 90
cents a pound at 9:25 a.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.
The price rose in the previous five sessions, the longest rally
since June.  Cattle futures for June delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
$1.214 a pound in Chicago. Prices are down 8.4 percent this year
through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement slipped less than
0.1 percent to $1.40525 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
