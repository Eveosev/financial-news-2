China’s stocks  rose for the first
time in three days as gains by automakers and Jiangxi Copper Co.
overshadowed losses by liquor-makers.  Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. rose the most in three
weeks after an auto dealer group said industry sales will pick
up. China Communications Construction Co. jumped 5.5 percent
after earnings topped estimates, while Jiangxi Copper climbed
1.5 percent as profit rose. Kweichow Moutai Co., the maker of
high-end spirits, retreated 1.8 percent.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  closed 0.2 percent higher at
2,301.26 after rising as much as 1.1 percent and falling 0.4
percent. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) , which tracks stocks in  Shanghai  and
Shenzhen, advanced 0.3 percent to 2,583.53. Hong Kong’s Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 1 percent.  “There’s fluctuation in the short term on liquidity
concerns and amid the release of company earnings,” Tang Yonggang, an analyst at Hongyuan Securities Co. in Beijing, said
by phone today.  The Shanghai Composite has retreated 5.5 percent from a
Feb. 6 peak on concern government steps to cool property prices
will drag on economic growth and as company earnings trailed
estimates. The measure is valued at 9.4 times projected 12-month
earnings, compared with the seven-year average of 15.8,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 15 percent
lower than the 30-day average for this time of day, while its
30-day  volatility  was near the highest level in 13 months.  IPO Concerns  Stocks pared earlier gains amid concern regulators will
restart initial public offerings, Xu Shengjun, an analyst at
Jianghai Securities Co. in Shanghai, said by phone today.  The
China Securities Regulatory Commission suspended issuance of IPO
shares in October, as investors’ appetite for new stocks waned
amid equity-market declines that drove the Shanghai Composite to
near four-year lows.  The CSRC is likely to resume IPO sales next month, with
about 60 companies receiving written approval, International
Finance News reported today, citing unidentified people.
International Finance News is run by the People’s Daily, a
mouthpiece of the Chinese communist party.  A  gauge  tracking consumer discretionary shares rose 0.9
percent. Changan Automobile gained 5.5 percent to 9.35  yuan , the
biggest gain since March 6. FAW Car Co. gained 2.5 percent to
8.32 yuan. The auto market may have picked up in March amid
warmer weather and new car models, the China Automobile Dealers
Association said.  Earnings Reports  China Communications Construction jumped 5.1 percent to
4.93 yuan, the biggest advance since Feb. 5. The company
reported full-year net of 12.2 billion yuan ($1.96 billion),
compared with the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg for 11.3 billion yuan.  Jiangxi Copper Co. advanced 1.5 percent to 22.95 yuan. Net
income rose 10 percent in the second half of last year.  Sixty-three percent of Shanghai Composite companies posted
annual profit that missed estimates, according to  data  on 193
earnings reports compiled by Bloomberg since Jan. 1.  An index tracking consumer staples fell 1.4 percent, taking
its decline this year to 2.8 percent. Kweichow Moutai lost 1.8
percent to 166.79 yuan. The stock has tumbled 20 percent in 2013
amid President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on extravagant spending by
officials.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., rallied 1.3 percent to $37.31
in New York yesterday, the highest close since March 15.  -- With assistance from Zhang Shidong in Shanghai. Editors:
