Treasury 10-year yields may climb
to a one-year high after their 200-day moving average bottomed
out, CIBC World Markets Japan Inc. said.  The 200-day moving average leveled off at about 1.71
percent after falling from a high of 3.17 percent in August
2011. The yields have been above the moving average since Jan. 3
and were at 1.91 percent as of 10:58 a.m. in  Tokyo . Yields may
hover around 2 percent in the next six months before advancing,
said Kazuaki Oh’e, a bond salesman in Tokyo at the unit of
Canada’s fifth-largest lender  “A resistance line will be the 2.3 percent level reached
April 4,” 2012, he said. “Once yields rebound to that level,
we’re likely to see them rise to about 2.4 percent by year-
end.”  That would be the highest since March 20 last year. Should
his projection turn out to be correct, investors who buy 10-year
notes today would lose 2.5 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
