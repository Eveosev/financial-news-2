West  Texas  Intermediate crude rose
to a five-week high after a government report showed that U.S.
refineries boosted operating rates, bolstering oil demand.  Futures advanced 0.2 percent after the Energy Information
Administration said  refineries operated  at 85.7 percent of
capacity in the seven days ended March 22, up 2.2 percentage
points from the prior week and the most in two months. Crude
supplies gained 3.26 million barrels to 385.9 million, the
highest level in nine months. Stockpiles of  distillate fuel , a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, fell 4.51 million
barrels to 115.3 million.  “The report was a net positive for the crude market even
with the big build in supply,” said John Kilduff, a partner at
Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on
energy. “The strong uptick in refinery activity signals greater
demand for crude in the weeks ahead. The distillate supply drop
was very large and raised concerns about how tight stocks are.”  Crude oil for May delivery rose 24 cents to $96.58 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement
since Feb. 19. The volume of all futures traded was 11 percent
below the 100-day average for the time of day at 3:47 p.m.  Brent oil for May settlement gained 33 cents, or 0.3
percent, to end the session at $109.69 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The volume of all futures
traded was 21 percent above the 100-day average. The European
benchmark was at a $13.11 premium to WTI, based on settlement
prices, after reaching $13.02 yesterday, the narrowest spread
since July.  Refinery Runs  Refinery runs , or the intake of crude for processing,
climbed 364,000 barrels a day to 14.9 million, the highest level
since the week ended Jan. 11, the EIA report showed. Units are
often reopened in the spring after being idled for maintenance
in late winter as attention shifts away from heating oil and
before the peak season for gasoline consumption.  The drop in distillate stockpiles left supplies at the
lowest level since November, according to the EIA. Gasoline
supplies fell by 1.6 million barrels to 221.2 million last week.  Heating oil for April delivery surged 3.41 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $2.9154 a gallon in New York. Volume was
7.2 percent above the 100-day average.  Gasoline for April delivery rose 0.49 cent to settle at
$3.1155 a gallon on the Nymex. Volume was 19 percent above the
100-day average.  Fuel Consumption  Total fuel  consumption  rose 0.3 percent to 18.4 million
barrels a day in the four weeks ended March 22, the EIA report
showed. Demand for  distillate fuel  climbed 5 percent over the
period to 3.75 million barrels a day. It was the biggest
distillate use increase since September.  Crude futures in New York tumbled as much as 0.8 percent in
intraday trading. The gain in crude supply left inventories at
the highest level since the week ended June 22. Imports rose 11
percent to 8.16 million, the most since the week ended Jan. 4.  “We got some mixed signals in the report,” said Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New
York. “The 3.3 million-barrel build in crude supplies triggered
a selloff in crude, while the 4.5 million-barrel drop in
distillate is putting upward pressure on heating oil. The
market’s trying to make sense of it all.”  Oil  output  advanced 1,000 barrels a day to 7.15 million,
near the 20-year high of 7.16 million reached in the week ended
March 8. Production has surged as the combination of horizontal
drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked
supplies trapped in shale formations in states including North
Dakota, Texas and  Oklahoma .  ‘Plenty of Supply’  “There’s plenty of supply here,” said  Chip Hodge , who
oversees a $9 billion natural-resource bond portfolio as senior
managing director at Manulife Asset Management in  Boston . “The
positive changes in the U.S. crude-oil production picture are
mind-boggling.”  Crude stockpiles at the U.S. storage hub in Cushing,
Oklahoma, rose 439,000 barrels to 49.5 million last week,
according to the EIA, the statistical arm of the Energy
Department. Supplies there reached a record 51.9 million in the
week ended Jan. 11.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI crude options
expiring in May was at 15.9 percent, a decrease from 16.4
percent yesterday. The figures have slipped from 24.7 percent on
Feb. 21.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 418,834
contracts as of 3:47 p.m. It totaled 556,397 contracts
yesterday, 0.3 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.69 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
