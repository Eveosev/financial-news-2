Louis Vuitton, which last month
raised prices by an average 12 percent in  Japan , has imposed
similar increases on non-leather handbags in most of its main
markets since the start of the year, according to HSBC.  The trunk maker owned by Paris-based  LVMH Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  lifted prices on bags such as the Speedy and
NeverFull by about 10 percent in the euro region,  Antoine Belge ,
an HSBC analyst, said today in a note to clients. Vuitton raised
prices by at least 10 percent in the U.K. and U.S., and by 5
percent to 10 percent in Asian markets including China, Hong
Kong,  Taiwan  and Singapore, the analyst wrote.  The euro’s strength against some currencies may lead LVMH
to charge more, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Bernard Arnault  said Jan. 31. Vuitton’s price increase in Japan, the
biggest ever by the brand in the country, was taken to offset
the impact of the yen’s slide on sales, the company said Feb.
20.  In addition to protecting margins, the “price increases
must be seen, in our view, as a means to accelerate LV’s
repositioning towards more leather,” Belge wrote. The decision
will probably weigh on the number of items sold, though it’s
“the right thing for brand equity longer term.”  Vuitton’s 2013 sales may rise 6 percent, excluding currency
moves, while volume may decline 2 percent to 3 percent, Belge
wrote. His estimate assumes a high single-digit average price
increase, including unchanged prices for most leather bags.  To contact the reporter on this story:
