AOL Inc. (AOL) , the publisher of websites
such as the Huffington Post and TechCrunch, climbed the most in
more than four months after Barclays Plc said profit will grow
faster than analysts’ estimates.  AOL  surged  8.4 percent to $39.20 at the close in  New York ,
the biggest price increase since Nov. 6. The shares have climbed
32 percent this year, outpacing the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index’s 9.6 percent rise.  Cost-cutting and modest revenue growth are helping AOL
boost profits,  Anthony DiClemente , a Barclays analyst, said in a
research note today. The company can add $100 million of annual
profit alone if it shuts down its local-news network, Patch, or
breaks even with the division by 2014, DiClemente said.  Profit will jump 34 percent this year to $441 million,
leaving out interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
Barclays estimated. The average analyst estimate compiled by
Bloomberg calls for 30 percent growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
