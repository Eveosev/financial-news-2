New Zealand  cricketer Jesse Ryder
is in a critical condition in a Christchurch hospital after he
was attacked outside a bar.  Ryder was the victim of a serious assault early today and
is in the hospital’s intensive care unit in an induced coma,
Detective Senior Sergeant Brian Archer said in an e-mailed
statement.  Ryder, who wasn’t available for international cricket this
season, played a game for his Wellington provincial team in
Christchurch yesterday. He is contracted to play for the Delhi
Daredevils in the Indian Premier League which begins on April 3.  “We are all shocked by what has occurred and extremely
concerned for Jesse,”  David White , chief executive officer at
New Zealand Cricket, said in an e-mailed statement.  Ryder last played for New Zealand in February 2012 before
being stood down for a breach of team protocol involving an
incident at a bar when he responded to taunts from a patron. New
Zealand drew the third and final test against  England  on March
26, leaving the series tied at 0-0.  Ryder was involved in two separate altercations outside a
bar in the suburb of Merivale, where he had been with some
teammates, Archer said. The second incident resulted in him
receiving “significant head injuries,” he said.  The injuries may include a fractured skull, the  Press 
reported on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
