A strike at the main copper export
hub for top producer Codelco’s northern mines is spreading to
other Chilean ports as the state-owned company seeks
alternatives to ship the metal.  Workers at  Antofagasta  and  Iquique  ports in northern  Chile 
went on strike yesterday in solidarity with a 12-day stoppage at
Angamos, the main northern harbor for Codelco. Workers at  San
Antonio , a fruit-handling port in central Chile, also joined the
action. Codelco is seeking other ports to export copper cathode
produced at its northern mines, an official who can’t be named
because of company policy said in an e-mailed response to
questions today.  Angamos handles copper cathode shipments from Codelco’s
Chuquicamata, Gaby and Radomiro Tomic mines as well as some
supplies from  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s Escondida and Spence mines.
Codelco supported construction of the port a decade ago to
reduce its dependence on the port of Antofagasta.  Ultraport SA, the operator of the Angamos port through its
unit Complejo Portuario Mejillones, held talks to end the 12-day
strike yesterday, the Codelco official said.  Ultraport, which operates 20 ports in the South American
country, said 70 percent of dockworkers at Angamos have accepted
improved pay conditions and only one of five unions is holding
out for a better deal, according to an e-mailed statement.  Copper declined 0.5 percent to $7,583 a ton at 2:19 p.m. in
 London  and the metal for delivery in May slipped 0.4 percent to
$3.43 a pound on the Comex exchange in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
