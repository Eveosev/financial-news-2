Merck KGaA (MRK) , Germany’s second-
biggest drug maker, raised a 2 billion-euro ($2.6 billion)
credit line to replace a loan due  next year .  The five-year transaction, which can be extended by as much
as two years, was provided by 19 banks, according to a statement
from the Darmstadt, Germany-based company. Merck arranged the
transaction itself and proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes and growth projects, the company said.  Merck had a credit line due Oct. 2014 that paid an interest
margin of 20 basis points more than the euro interbank offered
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Merck is  rated  Baa1 by Moody’s Investors Service and A- by
 Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
