Red Hat Inc. (RHT) , the largest seller of
Linux operating-system software, fell after reporting fiscal
fourth-quarter sales that missed estimates as some customers --
concerned about sluggish economic growth -- put off purchases.  Profit excluding some items was 36 cents a share on sales
of $347.9 million, the Raleigh, North Carolina-based company
said yesterday in a statement. That compares with analysts’
average prediction of earnings of 30 cents on revenue of $349.3
million, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales and
profit forecasts for the current period also missed projections.  Tax increases in the U.S. and a worsening recession in
 Europe  are causing businesses to delay upgrading to Red Hat’s
Linux software from older Unix systems, according to  Richard Williams , an analyst at Cross Research.  “The channel checks showed that activity just stopped
after the first week of December,” said Williams, who has a
hold rating on the stock, with $51 price target.  The  shares  decreased 1.2 percent to $49.35 at 9:46 a.m. in
 New York . Through yesterday, the stock had dropped 5.6 percent
this year.  Per-share earnings, excluding certain items, will be 30
cents to 31 cents in the fiscal first quarter, Red Hat said on a
conference call with analysts. That’s shy of the 32 cents
analysts were  projecting , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales will be $358 million to $361 million, missing
the $366.4 million estimate.  Investors were also disappointed by Red Hat’s fourth-
quarter billings, an indication of future sales, said  Steven
Ashley , an analyst at Robert W Baird & Co. Billings, calculated
as sales plus deferred revenue, were $454 million, compared with
analysts’ estimate of $471 million, he said.  Net income for the period, which ended Feb. 28, rose 19
percent to $43 million, or 22 cents a share, from $36 million,
or 18 cents, a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
