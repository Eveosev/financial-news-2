Louis Dreyfus Commodities BV, a
closely held commodities trader, said profit jumped 25 percent
last year, helped by cost cuts and currency-exchange gains even
as sales fell on lower prices for coffee and cotton.  Net income from continuing operations rose to $1.1 billion
from $879 million in 2011, Louis Dreyfus said in a  report  on its
website. Sales dropped 0.9 percent to $57.1 billion.  The company and its peers have sought to lower costs to
bolster balance sheets as slowing global growth curtails
commodity demand, weighing on prices. Cotton futures fell 18
percent in New York last year, while Arabica coffee futures
slumped 37 percent.  “The reduction of 1 percent in net sales was mainly due to
a globally lower price environment compared to historically high
prices in 2011,” Louis Dreyfus said.  The proteins business, which includes grain and oilseeds
trading, boosted operating profit by 20 percent to $1.09
billion, according to the report. In the tropicals unit, which
includes coffee and cotton as well as sugar, operating earnings
fell to $844 million from $915 million.  Commercial and administrative expenses retreated to $755
million from $810 million. Finance costs fell to $195 million
from $218 million as currency gains more than made up for
increased interest spending, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
