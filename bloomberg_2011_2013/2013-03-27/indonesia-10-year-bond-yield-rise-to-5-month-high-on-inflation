Indonesia ’s bonds dropped, driving
the 10-year yield to the highest level in almost five months, on
concern the government’s plan to adjust fuel subsidies will
quicken inflation and spur sales of the notes by global funds.
The rupiah was little changed.  The government sold 7.65 trillion rupiah ($786 million) of
bonds yesterday, with investors demanding rates as high as 6.28
percent for 15-year bonds, compared with 6.26 percent for
similar-maturity debt in the secondary market. Finance Minister
 Agus Martowardojo , who parliament approved yesterday as the next
central bank governor, said last week policy makers were
considering measures to manage subsidized-fuel usage. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a fourth-quarter inflation rate
of 5.33 percent, having predicted 5.10 percent in November.  “Uncertainty costs the  capital markets  greatly, since what
they want is certainty so they can price in the right amount of
risk,” said Herdi Wibowo, head of debt capital markets in
Jakarta at PT BCA Sekuritas, a unit of the nation’s largest
lender by market value. “Pressure on the rupiah has increased,
while fuel subsidies are depleting foreign reserves.”  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 climbed
two basis points to 5.59 percent as of 10:37 a.m. in Jakarta,
the highest level since Nov. 8, prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association show. The yield may climb as high as 5.8
percent in the first half, Wibowo said.  Sliding Reserves  Analysts cut their rupiah forecasts by the most among
 Southeast Asia ’s emerging currencies since January as the
nation’s foreign reserves fell $7.6 billion in the first two
months of this year to $105.2 billion, driving away investors
including Aberdeen Asset Management Plc.  “Foreign reserves reaching the $100 billion mark will
cause more concern in the market and cause the rupiah to weaken
further,” said Wibowo. “That will reduce Bank Indonesia’s
scope to limit the currency’s weakness.”  The rupiah traded at 9,730 per dollar, from 9,733
yesterday, prices from local banks show. The spot rate was at a
0.5 percent premium to the one-month non-deliverable forwards
which strengthened 0.1 percent to 9,780, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,753 yesterday by the Association of Banks in  Singapore ,
compared with 9,741 the previous day. Today’s rate will be
released at 11:30 a.m. in the city-state.  One-month implied volatility for the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 5.63 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
