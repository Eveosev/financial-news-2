President  Barack Obama  will break
bread with Senate Republicans next month, building upon recent
efforts to court lawmakers open to making a deal to reduce the
deficit.  Obama will join about a dozen Republican members on April
10 for dinner, according to a White House aide, who asked for
anonymity because the meeting hasn’t been announced.  Senator  Johnny Isakson , a Georgia Republican, was asked by
the president to invite other members of his caucus to the meal.
The group hasn’t picked a location.  The dinner -- which will be Obama’s second with Republicans
in about a month -- comes as the president’s poll numbers are
falling. He and Republicans didn’t avert across-the-board
spending cuts that took effect March 1.             In a
Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted March 7-10, 44 percent
of Americans approved of Obama’s handling of the economy -- six
points lower than in December 2012 after his re-election.  Earlier this month, the president traveled to  Capitol Hill 
for meetings with the Democratic and Republican caucuses in both
the House and Senate. Obama dined with a dozen Senate
Republicans on March 6.  In the days following those meetings, Obama called Isakson
“to say that he thought the first dinner was productive” and
asked him if he would organize a second with Senate Republicans,
said Isakson spokeswoman Joan Kirchner. The senator did not
attend the first meeting.  To contact the reporters on this story:
