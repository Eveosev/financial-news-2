Six chefs from around the world are each to cook in London for one night only in a weeklong series of gastronomic meals in the eastern district of  Bethnal Green .  The line-up is  Jose Avillez , of Restaurante Belcanto, Lisbon; Eneko Atxa of  Azurmendi , Larrabetzu,  Spain ; Kobe Desramaults of In De Wulf, Heuvelland (Dranouter),  Belgium ; Gaston Acurio of Astrid & Gaston,  Lima ; Rasmus Kofoed of Geranium, Copenhagen; and Andre Chiang of Andre, Singapore.  They have been invited by Portuguese-born chef Nuno Mendes and will each prepare a joint tasting menu with him for a single day at his London restaurant Viajante, in the  Town Hall Hotel , from April 25 to May 1. Tickets will be 135 pounds ($204).  “I’ve always liked the idea of bringing chefs from all over the world to cook here, showcase their work in  London ,” Mendes said in an interview. “These guys are all very accomplished, amazing chefs and their places are known around the world.  “When you have a collaboration between two chefs, there’s always an energy because we both have to adapt to each other’s work and we both have to find a common ground so the menu is fluid and there’s a certain energy to the experience.”  Tickets for the series, known as Craft, go on sale today via craft@viajante.co.uk.
