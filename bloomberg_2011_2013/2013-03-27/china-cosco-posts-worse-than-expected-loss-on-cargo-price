China Cosco Holdings Co. (1919) , the
nation’s biggest shipping company, reported a wider-than-
expected annual loss as dry-bulk rates slumped.  The  net loss  was 9.56 billion  yuan  ($1.54 billion),
compared with 10.5 billion yuan a year earlier, under
international accounting standards, the Tianjin-based company
said in a Hong Kong stock exchange  filing  yesterday. That is
wider than the 7.53 billion-yuan average loss of 22  analysts’
estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 4.4 percent to 88.3
billion yuan.  Chairman Wei Jiafu is restructuring the company’s assets in
a bid to return to profitability as a third straight annual loss
may result in shares being delisted in Shanghai. The company has
unveiled a plan to sell its logistics unit. It may raise as much
as 27 billion yuan selling assets to its parent, said two people
with knowledge of the matter this month.  “The outlook remains challenging,” Vivian Tao, an analyst
at Citigroup Inc., said in a note to clients today. The
logistics unit sale “is far from enough” to turn China Cosco
profitable this year and further restructuring can be expected,
she said.  China Cosco fell 4.2 percent to HK$3.66 at the close in
Hong Kong trading. The city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 0.7
percent.  China Cosco plans to sell Cosco Logistics Co. to state-
backed parent company China Ocean Shipping (Group) Co. for 6.74
billion yuan, the company said in a  separate statement . The sale
will give China Cosco a pretax gain of about 1.96 billion in
2013, the company said.  Rates, Costs  “2012 was a very difficult year for China Cosco,” Wei
said in a statement in Shanghai stock exchange, “Low rates,
high costs and imbalanced fleet structure” caused the loss, he
said.  The company’s main business units include container and
dry-bulk shipping, logistics and port terminal operations.  China Cosco last had an annual profit in 2010. According to
Shanghai stock exchange rules, companies that post two straight
annual losses can be subject to a “special treatment”
designation that cuts the daily trading limit for gains or
losses to 5 percent from 10 percent. A third consecutive annual
loss may result in shares being delisted.  Logistics Proceeds  The shipping company said yesterday that gains from the
logistics unit sale will boost earnings and reduce the risk of
its stock being suspended from trading in Shanghai.  China Cosco’s logistics unit made 595 million yuan
operating profit last year. Its terminal operations had a 679
million yuan operating profit.  The Drewry Hong Kong-Los Angeles 40-foot container rate
benchmark jumped 21 percent to $2,213 through last year,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. After climbing to its
highest so far this year in February, the benchmark declined to
$2,217 in the week started March 19, the data show.  Carriers are expected to raise the rates by $400 on
containers going from Asia to the U.S. west coast and by $600 to
all other destinations effective April 1, according to Bloomberg
Industries.  The dry-bulk vessels had a 7.8 billion yuan of operating
loss in 2012 as expansion in the global fleet outpaced China’s
demand for coal and iron-ore shipments. Cosco’s commodities-
shipping business had a 14.3 percent decline in traffic to 1.13
trillion ton-nautical miles last year. The company’s fleet fell
to 332 dry-bulk ships, compared with 374 at the end of 2011,
according to the statement yesterday.  The company this month said this isn’t a good time to sell
the dry-bulk unit because of the current weak market.  Dry Bulk  The Baltic Dry Index, a benchmark for commodity-shipping
rates, fell 0.4 percent to 931 points in London on March 26. It
slumped to a 25-year low last year.  China Cosco’s container shipping sales rose 17 percent to
48.4 billion yuan as volume gained 16 percent to 8.02 million
boxes and rates improved. Shipping companies including  A.P.
Moeller-Maersk A/S (MAERSKB) ’s container-shipping line, the world’s
biggest, have started raising rates to offset higher fuel costs
and recover from industrywide losses in 2011 because of a vessel
glut.  Still, China Cosco’s container shipping unit posted 1.5
billion yuan operating loss for 2012.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , the container terminal unit of the
company, posted a 12 percent drop in profit last year as a
smaller gain from its stake in a container maker outweighed
cargo volume growth.  China Cosco didn’t propose to pay any dividend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
