Treasury 10-year notes rose for a
third day before a report that economists forecast will show
home sales dropped last month, amid speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will keep  interest rates  low.  Five-year securities rose before a $35 billion sale of 2018
debt today. The notes were close to the most-expensive level
this year relative to their two- and 10-year peers as investors
sought shorter-maturity debt amid Fed pledges to keep borrowing
costs down. Treasuries also gained as the banking crisis in
Cyprus and political turmoil in Italy boosted demand for the
relative safety of U.S. government debt.  “The Fed has signaled interest rates will stay low for a
while and that’s likely to support demand for Treasuries,
especially shorter-dated notes,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a
fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets in Edinburgh.  The 10-year note yield declined six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.86 percent at 7:20 a.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
securities due February 2023 gained 1/2, or $5 per $1,000 face
amount, to 101 10/32. The five-year yield dropped three basis
points to 0.74 percent.  An index of pending home sales fell 0.3 percent in February
after rising 4.5 percent in the previous month, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
