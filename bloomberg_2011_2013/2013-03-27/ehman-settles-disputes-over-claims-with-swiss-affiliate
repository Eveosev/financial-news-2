Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
settled its disputes over claims with a Swiss affiliate, the
latest in a line of agreements after years of fighting about who
owes what to whom.  Terms of the settlement with Lehman Brothers Finance AG
weren’t disclosed in Lehman’s statement today announcing the
deal. The defunct investment bank said a copy of the agreement
will be filed in court in the next few weeks as part of a
request to a judge to approve the pact and that an April 24
court hearing will follow.  Lehman’s claims on affiliates, and amounts owed to them,
are among its largest single class of claims. Last year it said
it was owed $45.2 billion by affiliates, including the
$15.2 billion claimed from its defunct brokerage and
$14.3 billion owed by the Swiss affiliate. Last month, Lehman
settled its differences with the brokerage,  Lehman Brothers
Inc ., which granted it a $2.3 billion customer claim plus
$14 billion in unsecured claims.  Lehman, which is still liquidating and trying to cut claims
more than four years after it collapsed, plans a third payment
to creditors on April 4, of $14.2 billion.  So far, Lehman has paid creditors about 9 cents on the
dollar, or half of what it said it expects to pay by about 2016.  Lehman failed in September 2008, filing the biggest
bankruptcy in U.S. history, because of too much debt and risky
real estate investments, according to an examiner’s report.  The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-
13555,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
