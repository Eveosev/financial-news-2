Bacardi Ltd., the world’s biggest
rum maker, said the company has reduced the amount of water it
uses in manufacturing by 49.4 percent since 2006.  About 18 percent of Bermuda-based Bacardi’s energy now
comes from clean sources, contributing to a one-third reduction
in its greenhouse gas emissions, it said today in a statement.  Bacardi, which uses water for fermentation, distilling and
cleaning, said the company is using more-efficient equipment,
recycling systems and is avoiding unnecessary rinsing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
