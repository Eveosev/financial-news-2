Solar Frontier K.K., a unit of
Japanese oil refiner  Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. (5002) , will resume solar
panel production at a plant in southwestern  Japan  on July 1 amid
increasing demand and plans for new products.  The company suspended production at the end of last year at
the facility in Miyazaki prefecture that can produce 60
megawatts of solar panels annually to consolidate manufacturing
at a 900-megawatt plant, also in Miyazaki, the Tokyo-based
company said in a statement today.  Solar Frontier plans to make minor equipment changes at the
60-megawatt factory so that it can make new products to be sold
in Japan, according to the statement.  The decision came as demand for panels is increasing in
Japan and the company plans to introduce new products by the end
of April, Nobuyuki Nakajima, a spokesman for Solar Frontier,
said by phone today. He declined to elaborate.  The company makes CIGS solar panels -- thin-film units
using copper, indium, gallium and selenium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
