Taiwan’s bonds fell, pushing the
10-year yield to the highest level in almost a week, on
speculation investors are shifting to U.S. dollar assets. The
local currency weakened.  The  Dollar Index  traded near the highest level since August
after the S&P/Case-Shiller index showed U.S. residential real-
estate prices increased in January by the most since June 2006.
Taiwan sold NT$20 billion ($669 million) of 364-day Treasury
bills today at 0.629 percent, the second-lowest yield for that
maturity on record, and the central bank will leave its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 1.875 percent tomorrow,
according to all 20 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  “Attention has shifted to U.S. dollar assets, like
Treasuries,” said  Albert Lee , a fixed-income trader in Taipei
at Cathay United Bank Co. “The tight greenback liquidity has
made  Taiwan dollar  liquidity very loose.”  The yield on the 1.125 percent government bonds due March
2023 rose to 1.314 percent from 1.310 percent yesterday in
Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market. That was the
highest level since March 21.  The Taiwan dollar weakened 0.2 percent to NT$29.941 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It was
little changed one minute before the 4 p.m. close. The central
bank has sold the local currency in the run-up to the close on
most days in the past year, according to traders who asked not
to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.2 percent to
NT$29.85, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.55 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was little changed at
0.386 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
