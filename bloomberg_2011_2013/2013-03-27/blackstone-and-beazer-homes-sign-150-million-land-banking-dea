Blackstone Group LP (BX) ’s GSO Capital
Partners unit and  Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH)  said they will spend
$150 million buying land for development.  Funds managed by GSO Capital will purchase land selected by
Beazer Homes, the companies said today in a statement. Beazer
Homes, the Atlanta-based homebuilder, will then have an option
to acquire finished lots.  “As the housing recovery continues to gain momentum, we
are excited to partner with Beazer and extend our land banking
business,” Doug Ostrover, Blackstone senior managing director
and co-founder of GSO, said in the statement. “GSO has a long
history of working with Beazer, and we have great confidence
that the management team is positioning the company well in
order to capitalize on the recovery and regain profitability.”  Sales of new U.S. houses in February had the best back-to-
back months in more than four years, spurred by near record-low
borrowing costs and improving job prospects, the Commerce
Department reported yesterday. Residential real estate prices
increased in January by the most since June 2006, the S&P/Case-
Shiller index of property values in 20 cities also showed
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
