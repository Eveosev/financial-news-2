Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz trucks
unit and five dealers in Britain selling its vehicles were fined
2.8 million pounds ($4.2 million) by the U.K. antitrust
regulator for allegedly coordinating prices and sharing
commercially sensitive information.  The fines relate to five violations of competition law from
2007 to 2010, with each including two or three dealers, the
 Office of Fair Trading  said in a statement today.  The OFT last year dropped a separate probe into the
Mercedes unit and companies including  Fiat Industrial SpA (FI) ’s
Iveco brand to let the European Union focus on the case, which
involves a suspected cartel of truckmakers. In that probe, the
head of Mercedes-Benz trucks in the U.K. was arrested in 2010,
and then released on bail when the probe began.  Mercedes said it reached a settlement with OFT to resolve
the probe and has learned from the investigation. The company
said the deal relates to a single meeting held in 2009.  “The company has strengthened its internal controls, and
every member of staff participates in comprehensive and ongoing
integrity training programs,” spokesman Rob Halloway said in an
e-mailed statement. “The company and its staff have fully
cooperated with the investigators over the past three years.’  To contact the reporter on this story:
