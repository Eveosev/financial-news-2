Total SA bought a cargo of North
Sea Forties crude as the price of the benchmark grade rebounded.
There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals.  Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd. (BPCL)  bought Angolan Nemba grade, and
Nigerian Agbami from Chevron Corp. and Bonga from Morgan
Stanley, according to two traders of the crudes who asked not to
be identified because the information is confidential.  North Sea  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  sold Forties lot F0410 for loading
from April 14 to April 16 at 65 cents a barrel less than Dated
Brent, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. That compares with a trade
on March 25 at minus 75 cents to the benchmark.  Total also bid unsuccessfully for April 16 to April 22
crude at a 60-cent discount, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days narrowed by 9 cents to a discount of 68 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Yesterday’s level was the lowest since April 19.  Brent for May settlement traded at $109.29 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $108.21 in the previous session. The June
contract was at $109.02, a discount of 27 cents to May.  One Forties cargo was added to the April schedule and five
were advanced by one to three days, according to three people
with knowledge of the matter.  The changes mean that 21 Forties lots will now load next
month and 13 consignments from the original schedule have been
brought forward, the people said, asking not to be identified as
the information is confidential.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals, the Platts
survey showed.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened by 2 cents to $1.05 a barrel, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. In northwest  Europe , the  discount  was at $2.08 a barrel,
compared with minus $2.04 in the previous session. That’s the
widest since March 12.  OAO Surgutneftegas issued a tender to sell three 100,000
metric-ton cargoes for loading next month, according to two
people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be
identified as the information is confidential.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend rose by 5 cents to $3.22
a barrel more than Dated Brent, Bloomberg data show. That is the
first increase in two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
