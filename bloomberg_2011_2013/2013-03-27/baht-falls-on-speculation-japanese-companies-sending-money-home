Thailand ’s baht fell for a second
day on speculation Japanese companies are sending profits home
before the end of the fiscal year on March 31.  Government bonds 
were little changed.  Japanese firms accounted for 64 percent of projects
approved by the Thai Board of Investment in 2012, data compiled
by the Japan External Trade Organization show. Global investors
have  bought  $2.9 billion more sovereign debt than they sold this
month and pumped a net $168 million into stocks, official data
show. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index  rose this week
after Cyprus agreed a bailout with international lenders.  “Speculation of the Japanese repatriation seems to weigh
on the baht’s move this week,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a
researcher at the Japan Center for  Economic Research  in Tokyo.
“The money is still flowing into Thailand as its solid economy
attracts investors, but they seem to prefer bonds as Cyprus and
Europe’s debt issue are still lingering.”  The baht fell 0.1 percent to 29.37 per dollar as of 8:01
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has
appreciated 4.1 percent this year, the best performance among
Asia’s 11 most-traded currencies. One-month implied volatility,
a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 5.18 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.625 percent bonds due June
2023 was steady at 3.52 percent, the lowest level since Nov. 28,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Thailand will sell 8 billion
baht ($273 million) of notes due 2032 today.  The central bank raised its 2013 growth forecast in January
to 4.9 percent from an October prediction of 4.6 percent and
signaled it will revise the estimate upward. Imports climbed 11
percent in February after surging 41 percent the previous month,
while exports were unchanged after an increase of 16 percent,
according to the median estimates in a Bloomberg survey before a
government report tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
