Iceland’s parliament approved a
bill designed to prevent offshore investors re-investing their
kronur inside the island.  Foreign investors trapped behind Iceland’s capital controls
won’t be allowed to use their kronur assets to purchase
securities that are eligible for repo transactions with the
island’s central bank, according to a statement posted on the
Parliament’s  website . The measure includes Treasury bonds with
short maturities, it said.  Iceland imposed capital controls in 2008 after its
financial crisis triggered a krona sell-off that sent the
currency plunging as much as 80 percent in offshore trading. The
restrictions are blocking as much as $8 billion in kronur assets
from being sold, according to Reykjavik-based  Arion banki hf .  Investors affected by the controls had placed 197 billion
kronur ($1.6 billion) in Iceland’s Treasury bonds and bills as
of Feb. 28, according to a March 13 note by Thordur Gunnarsson,
an analyst with Jupiter Capital Management hf.  The new legislation also gives Iceland’s central bank
greater authority to investigate foreign exchange transactions
related to interest payments, dividends and contractual
payments. The bank can also fine individuals as much as 65
million kronur and companies as much as 250 million kronur for
breaking the new law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
