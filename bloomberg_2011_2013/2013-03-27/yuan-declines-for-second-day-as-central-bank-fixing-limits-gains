The  yuan  fell for a second day
after the People’s Bank of  China  lowered the currency’s
reference rate to a level that limits appreciation.  The People’s Bank of China cut the daily  fixing  by 0.02
percent to 6.2727 per dollar, 0.98 percent weaker than
yesterday’s closing spot price. The currency is allowed to trade
as much as 1 percent either side of the rate. The yuan touched
6.2095 on March 25, its strongest level since the government
unified official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  “The yuan is taking a breather after posting a new high,”
said Patrick Cheng, a foreign-exchange analyst at Haitong
International Securities Co. in Hong Kong. “There could be a
bit of caution among officials over the Cyprus situation when
they set the fixing.”  The yuan dropped 0.05 percent to 6.2140 per dollar as of
the close in  Shanghai , prices from the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System show. That’s 0.95 percent stronger than today’s
reference rate.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the Chinese currency
slipped 0.06 percent to 6.2085 per dollar, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.05
percent to 6.3020, a 1.4 percent discount to the spot rate in
Shanghai.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.215 percent.  Taiwan became the world’s fourth-largest offshore yuan
center in February, excluding Hong Kong and China, according to
Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, a
financial messaging platform. The island trailed behind the U.K.,
 Singapore  and  France  in the rankings. Yuan payments made by
Taiwan have grown 120 percent over the past six months, SWIFT
said in a report yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
