The Federal Reserve in April will
begin a statistical study of household finances to provide
policy makers data about the economic well-being of U.S.
families.  The Fed has conducted the survey every three years since
1983, the central bank said today in a statement. It is being
conducted for the Fed by a social science research organization
at the University of Chicago, through December of this year.  The research “is one of the nation’s primary sources of
information on the financial condition of different types of
households,” Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said in a letter to
prospective survey participants.  To contact the reporters on this story:
