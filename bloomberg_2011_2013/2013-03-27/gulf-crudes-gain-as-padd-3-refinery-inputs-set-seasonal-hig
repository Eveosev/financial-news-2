Oil produced on the  Gulf Coast 
strengthened against domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate
after a government report that demand from refiners in the
region jumped to a seasonal high.  Refinery inputs of crude and other feedstocks to refineries
in PADD 3, the Gulf Coast region, rose 452,000 barrels to  7.84
million barrels a day  in the week ended March 22, the highest
level for this time of year in data back to 1993, according to
from the Energy Information Administration, the statistics arm
of the Energy Department.  The gains for Gulf crudes follow the biggest drop in two
years for Light Louisiana Sweet against domestic benchmark West
Texas Intermediate yesterday as  Brent crude  weakened against WTI
to the narrowest premium since July.  “I wouldn’t abandon the TI-Brent ship,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in  New
York . “It’s had a good run, it could certainly correct. But it
looks like the trend is still in favor of TI.”  WTI weakened against Brent  by 42 cents to a discount of
$13.44 a barrel at 1:48 p.m. in New York. When Brent gains
versus WTI, it typically strengthens the value of U.S. grades
that compete with foreign oils priced against the European
benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 70 cents a
barrel to $17.10 at 2:05 p.m. New York time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet gained 60 cents a
barrel to $16.10.  Poseidon’s premium gained 80 cents to $11.65 a barrel over
WTI. Southern Green Canyon gained 90 cents a barrel to a $10.25
premium.  Mars Blend’s premium to WTI rose by 65 cents to $11.85 a
barrel. The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
strengthened by 60 cents to $14.30.  The discount for Western Canada Select against WTI narrowed
by 40 cents to $14.35 a barrel at 12:10 p.m. local time in
Calgary, according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc., which
also reported that Syncrude’s premium gained $1 a barrel against
WTI to trade at $8.50 a barrel at 11:36 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
