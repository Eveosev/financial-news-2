Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s largest
automaker, hasn’t decided about a 2014 Routan minivan as the
company’s contract with Chrysler Group LLC to build the vehicle
nears an end.  Volkswagen offers the 2013 Routan “to our employees, but
not as a retail vehicle,” Scott Vazin, a VW spokesman, said in
an e-mail. “We have not made a decision about the 2014 model.”
The contract with Chrysler ends with the 2014 model, he said.  Volkswagen, based in Wolfsburg, Germany, agreed with
Chrysler, then owned by  Daimler AG (DAI) , in 2006 to an alliance for
minivan production that began two years later. Auburn Hills,
Michigan-based Chrysler is now majority owned by Fiat SpA,
following the company’s 2009 government-backed bankruptcy.  Sergio Marchionne , who leads both Chrysler and Fiat, has
said he’s evaluating whether the U.S. company needs both the
Town & Country and Grand Caravan and which model will remain in
the market that Chrysler has led since introducing the first
minivan in 1983.  To contact the reporter on this story:
