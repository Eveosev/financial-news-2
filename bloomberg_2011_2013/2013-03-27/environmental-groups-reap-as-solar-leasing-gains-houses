Non-profit groups including the
Sierra Club and  The Wilderness Society  are raising funds by
promoting rooftop solar panels installed by Sungevity Inc., a
marketing model that may become more common as U.S. residential
installations accelerate.  The closely held developer of rooftop solar systems has
paid more than $1 million in referral bonuses to non-profits to
date through its Sungevity.org program, according to a statement
today.  The cost of referral fees and other incentives is offset by
the chance to market solar systems to a receptive audience, said
Danny Kennedy, president of the Oakland, California-based
company.  “It’s low-hanging fruit with organizations that are
similarly-minded,” he said in an interview.  The company has installed about 20 megawatts of systems
since 2008. Sungevity typically provides solar panels at no
upfront cost to homeowners, who make monthly payments for the
power under long-term contracts.  U.S. residential-solar installations are expected to grow
about 40 percent this year to 609 megawatts, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sungevity and other third-party solar
financing companies will handle 75 percent of the systems, up
from 60 percent last year.  “We always wanted to go with solar energy but didn’t want
to spend $50,000 to purchase a system,” said Bruce Clark, a
Long Valley, New Jersey, homeowner and Wilderness Society member
who has panels on his roof from Sungevity.  The solar company “sweetened the deal” by donating $1,000
to the charity and giving Clark a $1,000 gift card and an Apple
Inc. iPad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
