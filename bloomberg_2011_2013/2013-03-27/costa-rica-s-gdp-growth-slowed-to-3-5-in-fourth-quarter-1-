Costa Rica ’s  economic  growth slowed
in the fourth quarter of 2012 as exports eased and domestic
demand cooled in Central America’s second-biggest economy.  Gross domestic product in the $41 billion economy expanded
3.5 percent from a year earlier, down from 3.8 percent and 5.7
in the two previous quarters, the central bank said today.
Manufacturing was up 2.5 percent after a 0.4 percent contraction
in the third quarter.  Economic growth will probably accelerate to 4.2 percent
this year, the  International Monetary Fund  said in a March 22
 report . The Washington-based lender warned that widening fiscal
deficits could “make public debt dynamics unsustainable in the
long-run” and that current policies may lead to an overheating
of the economy, which would be exacerbated by a surge in capital
inflows.  Inflation in February was 6.52 percent, the highest since
2009 and beyond the central bank’s target of 5 percent, plus or
minus one percentage point. The government will release the
March consumer price index April 2.  Investors attracted by  interest rates  that peaked at 11
percent last year have fueled a 1.8 percent gain in Costa Rica’s
currency, the colon, in the past three months.  The central bank has bought more than  $530 million  this
year to limit the appreciation, which hurts exporters by making
their goods more expensive. The government is seeking
congressional approval to control capital inflows by raising
 reserve requirements  on foreign inflows and increasing the tax
on interest paid abroad.  The colon was unchanged today at 498.25 per dollar. The
currency has gained 2 percent this year, the most in Central
America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
