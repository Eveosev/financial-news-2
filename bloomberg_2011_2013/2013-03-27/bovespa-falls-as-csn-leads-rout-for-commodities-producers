The Bovespa index rose to a one-
week high as homebuilder  PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos &
Participacoes (PDGR3)  rallied amid speculation earlier losses were
excessive given a positive outlook for its business.  OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) , the oil company
controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , advanced after posting a
net loss in the fourth quarter that was less than analysts had
forecast.  The Bovespa climbed 0.2 percent to 55,787.97 at 12:14 p.m.
in Sao Paulo. A close at that level would be the highest since
March 20. Thirty-seven stocks sank on the gauge while 30
advanced. The real gained 0.3 percent to 2.0113 per dollar.  “Trading near 55,000, the Bovespa is cheap,” Rodolfo Amstalden, an analyst at consulting firm Empiricus Research,
said by phone from Sao Paulo. “PDG reported awful earnings in
the fourth quarter, but investors may be buying now thinking
about the long-term perspectives for the company. Looking at the
next 18 to 24 months, the outlook for the industry as a whole,
PDG included, is positive.”  PDG Realty gained 5.1 percent to 3.12 reais. The stock
earlier tumbled as much as 4.4 percent after it reported an
unexpected net loss of 1.79 billion reais in the fourth quarter.  OGX, the worst-performing stock this year on the Bovespa
index, gained 3 percent to 2.37 reais. The company posted a net
loss of 264.3 million reais in the three months ending in
December, which compares with the average estimate for a loss of
302.5 million among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
