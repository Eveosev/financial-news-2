Mortgage applications in the U.S.
rose last week as lower mortgage rates prompted an increase in
refinancing and home purchases.  The Mortgage Bankers Association’s  index  climbed 7.7
percent in the period ended March 22 after falling 7.1 percent
in the prior week, the Washington-based group reported today.
The refinance gauge increased 8 percent, while the purchase
index advanced 6.7 percent.  The average  rate  on a 30-year fixed loan fell to 3.79
percent from 3.82 percent in the prior period. The rate reached
a record-low of 3.47 percent in the first week of December. The
cost of a 15-year mortgage held at 3.02 percent.  The share of applicants seeking to refinance a loan rose to
75 percent from 74.8 percent, today’s report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
