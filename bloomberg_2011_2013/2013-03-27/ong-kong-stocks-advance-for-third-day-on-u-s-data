Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
city’s benchmark index rising a third day, after U.S. home
prices climbed the most since 2006 and orders for durable goods
beat estimates, boosting earnings prospects for Asian exporters.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , the maker of Ryobi power tools
that counts the U.S. as its biggest market, gained 4.5 percent.
China Communications Construction Co., which helped build
sections of the new San Francisco Bay Bridge, jumped 4.7 percent
after posting full-year profit that beat analyst estimates.
Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. added 1.6 percent after the developer
controlled by Asia’s richest man reported full-year profit that
surpassed expectations.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 0.8 percent to 22,491.09 as of
10:04 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
rose 1.5 percent to 11,093.22. The Hang Seng Index climbed to
its highest since April 2011 in January amid signs the  U.S.
economy  is recovering before sliding in the past two months. The
gauge fell 6.3 percent since Jan. 30 through yesterday on
concern that China will add property curbs and Cyprus’s problems
will reignite Europe debt crisis.  “Average U.S. investors feel more secure about their jobs,
seeing their house prices go up, and think the crisis is well
behind them,” said  Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief investment
strategist at Russell Investment Group, which manages about $160
billion. “We like  emerging markets  and Asia simply because,
even though there’s concern about Chinese policy tightening,
earnings numbers still look good.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
