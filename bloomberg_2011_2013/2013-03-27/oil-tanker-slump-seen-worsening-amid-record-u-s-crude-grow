The market for tankers carrying
crude will extend a slump this year because U.S. oil production
is  growing  at the fastest pace on record, according to Jefferies
Group Inc.  Earnings for very large crude carriers, the biggest tankers
that each haul 2 million barrels of oil, will average $14,000
daily in 2013, compared with $18,564 in 2012 and $100,600 in
2008, the New York-based investment bank said in a report sent
by e-mail today.  Oil inventories are near a 20-year high in the U.S., the
largest importer, and domestic production is increasing the most
since at least 1859, Jefferies said. As domestic output curbs
demand for crude carriers, itâ€™s also helping spur record U.S.
exports of refined petroleum this year, lifting demand for the
product tanker fleet by 3 percent to 4 percent, it said.  Hire costs for the fleet of 1,300 Handymax product tankers,
that carry the most refined-oil products, will gain to $15,000 a
day in 2013 from $12,890 last year, according to Jefferies.
Rates averaged $28,375 in 2008, the bank said.  Crude tanker rates may rally again next year provided
global growth quickens and the economies of  Europe  and the U.S.
improve, according to Jefferies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
