Parts of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia’s
second-largest city, are enduring “unprecedented” water
shortages due to tanker delivery delays,  Arab News  reported,
citing residents in the Red Sea coastal city.  Neighborhoods are waiting as long as 72 hours for water
deliveries compared with an hour in the past, the Jeddah-based
newspaper said, citing residents. A ban on water tankers during
peak traffic has been temporarily lifted to make more supplies
available, the paper said.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest producer of desalinated
water, is building power stations to cope with growing demand
and adding more plants that convert seawaters into drinking
water. Minister of Water and Electricity Abdullah Al-Hussayen
said in January that the Saudi government had allocated $6.4
billion for water and sanitation projects in 2013.  Abdullah al-Assaf, director-general of the National Water
Company in Jeddah, said an additional 200,000 cubic meters of
water will be provided to Jeddah, Arab News said. Saudi Arabia’s
 National Water Company  is working on a $133 million water
storage plant in Jeddah to improve supplies in the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
