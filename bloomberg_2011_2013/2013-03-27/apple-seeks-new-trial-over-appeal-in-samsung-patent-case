Apple Inc. (AAPL)  asked to proceed with a
new trial on 14  Samsung Electronics (005930)  Co. products for which a
U.S. judge overturned a jury patent-infringement award rather
than letting Samsung appeal her decision upholding damages for
14 other products covered by the jury’s verdict.  Apple, in a reply yesterday to Samsung’s request to seek an
appeal and put the case on hold, said the Suwon, South Korea-
based company’s proposal would “likely lead to a remand without
a substantive decision” from an appeals court.  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose,  California , on
March 1 reduced the $1.05 billion in damages a jury awarded
Apple in its patent fight with Samsung by $450.5 million. The
judge ruled that the jury based its award for 14 Samsung
products on an incorrect legal theory and suggested the
companies consider appealing her ruling.  Apple said in a separate filing yesterday that, if Koh
intends to allow Samsung to proceed with an appeal before a new
trial, it wants to asks the judge to reconsider her post-trial
ruling and seek reinstatement of the $85.3 million the jury
awarded for Samsung’s Galaxy S II AT&T and Infuse 4G.  Samsung and Apple, the world’s two biggest smartphone
makers, have each scored victories in patent disputes fought
over four continents since the Cupertino, California-based
iPhone maker accused Asia’s biggest electronics maker of
“slavishly copying” its devices.  The case is Apple v. Samsung, 11-01846, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California ( San Jose .)  To contact the reporter on this story:
