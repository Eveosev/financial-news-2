President  Barack Obama  will visit
Mexico and  Costa Rica  during the first week of May to discuss
economic, immigration, and trade issues.  White House and Mexican officials said Obama plans to meet
with Mexican President Pena Nieto. The two leaders spoke by
telephone today.  “The agenda between both countries is broad and directly
affects both societies,” said a statement released by the
Mexican foreign ministry. “During the visit, competitiveness,
education and innovation will be addressed, as well as border
infrastructure, trade, immigration and citizen security, among
other issues of shared interest.”  In Costa Rica, Obama will meet with President Laura Chinchilla, along with the heads of several central American
countries and the Dominican Republic.  The trip, scheduled for May 2-4, comes as Obama pushes the
 U.S. Congress  to pass legislation that would overhaul the
nation’s immigration system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
