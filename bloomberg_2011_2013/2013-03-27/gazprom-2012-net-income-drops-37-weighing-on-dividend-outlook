OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s largest
natural-gas producer, said 2012 profit fell 37 percent based on
domestic accounting standards, weighing on its dividend outlook.  Net income declined to 556 billion rubles ($17.9 billion),
the company said today in a statement on its website.  Gazprom’s dividend would be 139 billion rubles, or 5.9
rubles a share, based on its policy of paying out a quarter of
profit to shareholders. That compares with the 7 ruble to 8
ruble figure it estimated in a presentation in February.  The company paid 8.97 rubles for 2011. It has about 23.7
billion shares outstanding, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
