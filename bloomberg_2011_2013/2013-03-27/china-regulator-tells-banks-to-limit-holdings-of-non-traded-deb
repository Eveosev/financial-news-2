China’s banking regulator told
lenders to limit investments of client funds in debt that isn’t
publicly traded and to isolate such risks from their operations.  Such investments can’t exceed 35 percent of all funds
raised from the sale of wealth management products, or 4 percent
of the lender’s total assets at the end of the previous year,
the China Banking Regulatory Commission said in a  statement  on
its website.  Investments by banks’ wealth management funds into “non-
standardized debt assets,” such as loans, letters of credit and
receivables that aren’t traded on exchanges or the interbank
market, “increased rapidly” recently, the CBRC said. Some
lenders didn’t isolate related risks promptly, and some used the
practices to skirt lending restrictions, according to the
statement, dated March 25.  The outstanding balance of banks’ wealth management
products may have reached 13 trillion  yuan  ($2.1 trillion) at
the end of last year, compared with 8.5 trillion yuan a year
earlier, according to Fitch Ratings. Such products, which pay
higher rates than regulated deposits, help lenders retain
clients.  Banks should keep separate accounts for each wealth
management product, and must set aside capital by the end of
this year if they can’t do so for non-traded assets invested
before the statement was issued, the regulator said.  Lenders can’t provide any guarantee on such non-traded
debts or promise repurchases, according to the statement.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editor: Nathaniel Espino, Tomoko Yamazaki  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
