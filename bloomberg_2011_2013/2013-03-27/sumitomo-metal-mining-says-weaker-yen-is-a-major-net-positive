Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. (5713) , Japan’s
biggest nickel producer, is reaping “major” benefits as the
nation’s currency continues to weaken against the U.S. dollar,
in which most metals are priced, an executive said.  Every one yen decline in the Japanese currency against the
dollar increases consolidated pretax profit of the company’s
mining operations by 1 billion yen ($10.6 million) on an annual
basis, Senior Managing Executive Officer Yukio Kawaguchi said in
an interview in  Tokyo .  “A weaker yen has major positive impact on our commodity
unit” as copper and gold, the company’s main mining businesses,
are priced in U.S. dollars, Kawaguchi said. The currency move
inflates profit, which is reported in yen, and is hence “a
plus” even when buying new assets, he said.  Sumitomo Metal Mining seeks to boost profit to 100 billion
yen in the year ending March 31, 2022, from 65 billion yen last
year, as it increases output across its three main metals, which
also include nickel. The company last  reported a profit  of more
than 100 billion yen in the year ending March 31, 2008, during
which  Japan ’s currency averaged 114.27 to the dollar. The yen
strengthened to 75.82 to the dollar on Oct. 28 before rallying
to above 94 today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
