European stocks  fell to a three-
week low, led by a selloff in banks, as the leader of Italy’s
Democratic Party ruled out the possibility that rival
politicians will agree on a broad coalition government.  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA and Banco Popolare SC
slid more than 1 percent as Italian bond yields surged.  TDC (TDC)  A/S
dropped 1.6 percent as its private-equity owner sold another 6.8
percent stake in the Danish phone company.  Safran (SAF)  SA slipped 1.5
percent as the French government sold 13 million shares in the
maker of aircraft engines.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  slid 0.5 percent to 292.44 at
the close of trading in London, after earlier rallying as much
as 0.4 percent and sliding as much as 1 percent. The gauge
climbed in afternoon trading yesterday as better-than-estimated
U.S. data bolstered confidence in the world’s largest economy.  “We haven’t taken any positions against  Europe , but we
think the growth story is just not there at the moment,” Axel Weber, chairman of UBS AG told Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg
Television in London. “We think the structural problems are
unresolved. I still think there is some potential for equities
to improve particularly for the U.S.”  National benchmark indexes retreated in all 18 western-
European markets today.  France ’s CAC 40 dropped 1 percent and
 Germany ’s DAX slid 1.2 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 declined 0.2
percent.  Bond Yields  Italy ’s FTSE MIB Index lost 0.9 percent as the leaders of
the Five Star Movement said they will not form a coalition
government with Pier Luigi Bersani, the leader of the Democratic
Party. Bersani won a majority in the lower house of Italy’s
parliament last month. He needs additional support in the Senate
to form a viable government.  Yields on Italy’s benchmark 10-year bonds surged 21 basis
points to  4.78 percent  as the meeting left Bersani without the
means to assemble a majority in the Senate. He will probably
have to strike an alliance with former Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi by tomorrow or abandon his attempt to form a
coalition government.  Monte Paschi, the world’s oldest lender, dropped 4.3
percent to 18.5 euro cents in Milan, Banco Popolare slid 1.3
percent to 97.8 cents. The  Euro Stoxx Banks Index (SX7E)  declined 1.4
percent to its lowest level since November.  TDC lost 1.6 percent to 44.69 kroner after NTC Holding sold
a 2.49 billion-kroner ($427 million) stake in Denmark’s largest
phone company. UBS AG placed the 56.3 million shares via an
accelerated bookbuild at 44.27 kroner apiece. NTC also sold a 15
percent stake in TDC in February.  Safran, Belgacom  Safran declined 1.5 percent to 34.96 euros as France’s
finance ministry sold 449 million euros ($574 million) of shares
in Europe’s second-biggest maker of aircraft engines. Societe
Generale SA placed the shares at 34.50 euros apiece, according
to an update sent to clients that was obtained by Bloomberg
News. The stock closed at 35.49 euros yesterday.  Belgacom SA slid 2.4 percent to 19.14 euros as Belgian
newspaper De Tijd reported the government has considered selling
stakes in some of its assets to help keep the national debt
below 100 percent of gross domestic product.  The state may sell a 3.5 percent stake in the mobile-phone
operator as well as its holdings in  BNP Paribas SA. (BNP)   Belgium  owns
10 percent of  France’s largest bank , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. BNP Paribas retreated 1.7 percent to 39.67 euros.  Mediaset Rallies  Mediaset SpA (MS)  jumped 5.3 percent to 1.63 euros even as the
Italian broadcaster controlled by Berlusconi reported a full-
year net loss and scrapped its dividend for the first time in
its history. The company posted sales of 3.72 billion euros,
exceeding the  average analyst estimate .  TUI Travel Plc (TT/)  rose 4 percent to 322.8 pence after saying
the company remains well placed to meet its full-year
performance targets. The company said it expects to report
operating profit growth toward the upper end of its guidance of
7 to 10 percent. Parent company TUI AG added 2.3 percent to 8.36
