Ireland extended an incentive
program for clean energy projects by two years to give
developers more time to complete their developments.  Projects operating before the end of 2017 will be eligible
for the second Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff program, compared
with 2015 previously, according to Pat Rabbitte, the minister
for communications, energy and natural resources.  The program began last year to spur the creation of 4,000
megawatts of renewable electricity capacity on the Irish grid.
It backs small and large-scale onshore wind farms, biomass power
stations and hydropower plants of less than 5 megawatts as
Ireland seeks to get as much as 40 percent of its electricity
from renewables by 2020 from about 20 percent now.  Ireland won’t meet its clean power target without boosting
the wind energy built to at least 250 megawatts a year from 180
megawatts now, Rabbitte told a conference in Dublin today.  Failure to meet the 40 percent goal will lead to European
Union charges of as much as 150 million euros ($192 million) a
year for each percentage point shortfall and another 250 million
euros to buy emissions permits to fill the gap, Rabbitte said,
citing estimates from the nation’s Sustainable Energy Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
