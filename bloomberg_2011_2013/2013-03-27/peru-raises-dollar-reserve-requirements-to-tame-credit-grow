Peru ’s central bank increased
dollar  reserve requirements  for a fourth consecutive month as it
attempts to damp demand for credit in the U.S. currency.  The reserve ratio will rise by 0.25 percentage point for
lenders who have less than 50 percent of their U.S. currency
holdings at the central bank, according to a statement posted on
the bank’s  website  today. The increase is effective April 1.  Banco Central de Reserva del Peru is reducing the local
 money supply  after demand for dollar credit accelerated last
month for the first time since September. The sol appreciated
last year at the fastest pace since 2009 as U.S. monetary
stimulus fueled dollar inflows into  emerging markets . The sol is
down 1.5 percent this year after the central bank increased
reserve requirements and bought $4 billion in the foreign
exchange market.  The sol fell 0.2 percent to 2.5920 at 9:24 a.m. in Lima,
according to prices from Datatec.  Dollar credit rose 15 percent in February from the year
earlier after a 14.6 percent increase the month before, the bank
said in a March 25 report. Sol loan growth slowed to 15.5
percent from 15.7 percent over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
