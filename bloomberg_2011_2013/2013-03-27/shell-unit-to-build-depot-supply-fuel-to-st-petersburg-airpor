Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s venture
with Russia’s OOO Aerofuels Group will invest $5 million in a
fuel storage depot at St. Petersburg’s Pulkovo Airport as it
begins supplying jet fuel to Russia’s third-biggest airport.  ZAO Shell will build the kerosene depot with a capacity of
40,000 tons in the third quarter of this year, said Paul Cluett,
the venture’s general director, at a briefing in Russia’s
second-biggest city today.  The venture would cut into the fuel-supply monopoly of ZAO
Sovex, a joint venture of  OAO Lukoil (LKOH)  and OAO  Gazprom Neft (GAZ) , by
supplying as much as 10 percent of the airport’s fuel needs,
said Sergei Emdin, the general director for Pulkovo operator OOO
Northern Capital Gateway. Sovex sold about 420,000 tons of fuel
to the airport in 2012, Emdin said.  Pulkovo is “attractive with high-speed development,” said
Cluett. “The company expects to enter other regional airports
in Russia.”  Russian airports handled 166.8 million passengers in 2012,
17 percent more than a year earlier, according to the
Transportation Ministry. Pulkovo handled about 11 million
passengers, 16 percent more than in 2011.  ’  To contact the reporter on this story:
