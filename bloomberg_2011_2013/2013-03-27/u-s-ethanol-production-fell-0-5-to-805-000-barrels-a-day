U.S. ethanol production fell 0.5
percent to 805,000 barrels from 809,000 in the seven days ended
March 22, the third decline in four weeks.  Output slipped to the lowest level since March 1 while
 stockpiles  dropped 5.6 percent to 17.4 million barrels, the
eighth week of consecutive declines, a record. The inventory
level was the lowest since December 2011, the Energy Information
Administration said today.  Imports were unchanged at 27,000 barrels a day, down 78
percent from the record of 122,000 barrels in October, according
to the the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 95 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, little changed from last week’s all-time
high in records going back to May 2004, the report showed.  Denatured ethanol for April delivery increased 4.1 cents,
or 1.6 percent, to $2.578 a gallon at 11:11 a.m.  New York  time
on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have gained 18 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
