Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s
Chinese partner reported full-year profits that missed analysts’
estimates as a slowing economy led to intensifying competition
from Beijing to Shanghai.  Net income at  Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd. (1114) 
increased 27 percent to 2.3 billion  yuan  ($370 million), the
company said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange
today. That compares with the 2.36 billion yuan average of 31
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales declined 8.2
percent to 5.92 billion yuan.  China’s economy  grew 7.8 percent in 2012, the slowest in 13
years, prompting vehicle makers to step up incentives to lure
consumers. Promotions escalated during the end of the year as
dealers worked to reduce inventory, according to industry
researcher IHS Automotive.  “During the year 2012,  China ’s automobile sector continued
to show mild growth,” Wu Xiao’an, Brilliance’s chairman, said
in the statement. “The years 2013 and 2014 will remain
challenging for this business, and it is likely that the minibus
operation will bring negative financial impact to the Group’s
overall performance during those periods.”  Brilliance gained 0.2 percent to HK$10.26 in Hong Kong
before the announcement, extending the company’s gains this year
to 7.6 percent. The benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 0.7 percent
today.  BMW Deliveries  Brilliance, which assembles the 3- and 5-series sedans,
said BMW deliveries increased 49 percent last year to 160,849
units. The automaker will sell an estimated 200,000 BMWs this
year, said Wu.  BMW deliveries in China -- including vehicles shipped from
Germany -- climbed 40 percent to 327,341 vehicles last year,
while  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi saw sales -- including in  Hong Kong  -
- gain 30 percent to 405,838 units, according to the companies.  BMW has the largest and broadest dealer network, according
to Morgan Stanley analysts led by Edoardo Spina. They estimated
in a note last month that BMW had 343 dealerships in the country
as of January, compared with Audi’s 295, indicating that BMW is
reaching farther inland into China’s third- and fourth-tier
cities, where cars can fetch higher prices because competition
is less intense.  Wu said the company is investigating a report by the state
broadcaster that named Brilliance among automakers whose locally
made cars emitted pungent smells that caused some owners to show
physical symptoms such as dizziness and swollen fingers.  Brilliance will open about 60 new dealerships this year,
according to Senior Vice President Lisa Ng.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
