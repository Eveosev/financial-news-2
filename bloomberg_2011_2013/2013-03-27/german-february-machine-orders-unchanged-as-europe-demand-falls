German plant and machinery orders
were unchanged in February as domestic demand compensated for a
drop abroad, the VDMA machine-makers association said today.  Orders, adjusted for inflation, were at the same level as a
year ago in February after decreasing an annual 2 percent in
January, VDMA said in an e-mailed statement. Domestic orders
increased 2 percent while orders from abroad fell 1 percent from
a year ago.  Political turmoil in  Italy  and a bailout in Cyprus are
rekindling doubts that the 17-member euro area is taming the
debt crisis, threatening the economic recovery. The Bundesbank
still forecasts that Germany’s economy,  Europe ’s largest, will
return to growth in this quarter after contracting in the final
three months of last year.  “Foreign orders were burdened by rather weak demand from
the euro area, while demand from outside the single currency
stagnated,” said  Ralph Wiechers , VDMA’s chief economist.
“Thanks to bulk orders, domestic demand managed to record a
small plus.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
