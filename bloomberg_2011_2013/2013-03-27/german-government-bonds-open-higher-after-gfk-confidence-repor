German government bonds advanced
after  GfK SE (GFK)  said  consumer confidence  in Europe’s biggest
economy will remain unchanged in April.  The yield on the nation’s 10-year debt fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.33 percent as of 7:04 a.m.
London time. The rate on the two-year note also dropped one
basis point, to zero.                                  The Nuremberg-based market research company forecast today
that its consumer-sentiment index, based on a survey of about
2,000 people, will remain unchanged at 5.9 next month. That’s in
line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 30
economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
