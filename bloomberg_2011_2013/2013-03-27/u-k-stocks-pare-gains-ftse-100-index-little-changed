U.K. stocks  fell, even as the  FTSE
100 Index (UKX)  headed for its longest streak of monthly gains since
1997, as Italian bond yields rose after the Mediterranean
country sold debt and U.S. data showed pending house sales
dropped in February.  ICAP Plc (IAP)  declined the most in more than four months after
the world’s largest broker of transactions between banks said
profit will slip this year.  TUI Travel Plc (TT/)  rose 4 percent after
forecasting that its operating profit will grow at the top of
its projections in 2013.  The FTSE 100 Index lost 11.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to
6,387.56 at the close of trading in London. The benchmark gauge
has still rallied 8.3 percent so far this year as U.S. lawmakers
agreed on a compromise budget and U.S. jobs and housing data
beat forecasts. The broader FTSE All-Share Index slid 0.3
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index retreated 0.3 percent.  “We’re neutral on Europe. We haven’t taken any positions
against Europe but the growth story is just not there at the
moment,” Axel Weber, chairman at UBS AG in Zurich, told
Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg Television. “Structural problems
are unresolved and that’s not going to bode well for equities.”  Prudential Plc (PRU) , Schroders Plc, and British Land Co. Plc
trade without the right to their latest dividend today, wiping
out more than 3 points from the FTSE 100,  data compiled  by
Bloomberg show. The volume of shares trading hands in FTSE 100-
listed companies was 5.4 percent more than the average of the
past 30 days, data showed.  Italy Debt Auction  Italy’s 10-year sovereign-bond yields rose 19 basis points
to 4.76 percent, while rates on five-year notes increased 22
basis points to 3.56 percent. The country sold debt due in 2018
and 2023, with the five-year bond auction seeing its lowest bid-
to-cover ratio since 2002, according to  data compiled  by
Bloomberg.  In the U.S., contracts to purchase previously  owned houses 
slipped 0.4 percent in February, more than the 0.3 drop forecast
by economists in a Bloomberg survey. That follows a revised 3.8
percent increase in January, which was the fastest pace since
May.  The U.K. economy shrank 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter
last year from the previous period,  final figures  from the
Office for National Statistics showed today. That’s the fourth
contraction in five quarters.  Bank Capital  U.K. lenders must raise at least 25 billion pounds ($38
billion) to make up a shortfall in capital to cover higher
estimates for expected loan losses, potential fines and better
risk calculations, the Bank of England said.  The shortfall follows an examination by the Financial
Services Authority into banks’ exposure to commercial real
estate and euro-area economies, risk models and provisions for
compensation and fines over a three-year period.  ICAP plunged 6.3 percent to 302.3 pence, its lowest price
since Dec. 12, after predicting full-year profit will decline
about 21 percent this year. Pretax profit will be about 280
million pounds, the low end of a range the company gave a month
ago, ICAP said in a statement.  Prudential declined 2.4 percent to 1,051 pence, excluding
the impact of the loss of dividend rights. The U.K. finance
regulator fined the country’s biggest insurer 30 million pounds,
and censured Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam for not
telling it soon enough that it planned to acquire American
International Group Inc.’s Asian subsidiary.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , the second-largest stock on the FTSE
100 by  weight , lost 0.9 percent to 186 pence. A gauge of
telecommunication companies was among the worst performers of
the 19 industry groups on the Stoxx 600.  Centamin Plc declined 4.6 percent to 53.65 pence after the
miner of gold in Egypt reported earnings that fell short of
analyst predictions. The stock has still gained 37 percent so
far this year, compared with an 11 percent drop for an  index  of
European mining stocks.  TUI Travel climbed 4 percent to 322.8 pence, its biggest
increase in five weeks. The holiday operator said operating
profit will probably rise this year near the top of the 7
percent to 10 percent range it earlier projected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
