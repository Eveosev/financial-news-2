Ethanol strengthened against
gasoline for the first time in four days after the government
said stockpiles declined for a record eighth consecutive week.  The spread, or price difference, narrowed 4.11 cents to
53.25 cents a gallon after the U.S. Energy Information
Administration said  inventories  plunged to 17.4 million barrels,
the lowest level since December 2011. Production has averaged
797,000 barrels a day for the first 12 weeks of the year, down
13 percent from a year earlier. Last week’s output was 805,000.  “We can’t seem to maintain our production numbers,” said
Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “There’s
definitely going to be some supply concerns going forward.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery rose 4.6 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $2.583 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have risen 18 percent this year.  Gasoline futures for April delivery gained 0.49 cent to
$3.1155 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Output of the fuel has slumped after the worst drought
since the 1930s sent corn prices to a record in August, eroding
profits for distillers.  Corn for May delivery climbed 5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$7.3525 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Crush Spread  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was minus
10 cents a gallon, compared to minus 14 cents yesterday. The
spread was more than twice that at the beginning of the year.  The amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  Production may also be hampered by a shortage of rail cars
as some idled ethanol companies sublet theirs for transporting
products from shale deposits and to capitalize on surging prices
for them, Kitt said.  This is the first time in records going back to 2010 that
stockpiles haven’t risen during the January to March period,
data from the Energy Department’s analytical arm show.  “You went from building inventories between January and
March to drawing them down,” Kitt said. Stockpiles rose 26
percent in the first quarter of 2012 and 19 percent in the first
quarter of 2011.  Imports Unchanged  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 95 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, little changed from last week’s all-time
high in records going back to May 2004, today’s report showed.  Imports were unchanged at 27,000 barrels a day, down 78
percent from the record of 122,000 barrels in October, EIA said.  Brazil, where the biofuel is made from sugarcane, is the
largest supplier of ethanol to the U.S.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  fetched $2.28 a gallon last week,
12 percent below today’s futures price, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol increased 1 cent to $2.66 a
gallon in  New York , 2.5 cents to $2.575 in Chicago, 1 cent to
$2.62 on the  Gulf Coast  and 1 cent to $2.785 on the West Coast,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf was unchanged
at 16.5 cents. Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor narrowed to
8.5 cents, the lowest level since March 11.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, for
corn-based ethanol rose 3 cents to 69.5 cents, the highest price
since March 21 and the first time for consecutive gains since
March 8, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Advanced RINs, which include biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcane-based ethanol, slipped 1 cent to 74 cents.  RINs are certificates assigned to each gallon of biofuel
produced. Once refiners blend the biofuel into petroleum they
can keep the credit to show compliance to the Environmental
Protection Agency or trade it to another party.  Certificates for both grades of RINs rose to records on
March 8 and the surge has been a source of contention between
oil interests and ethanol supporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
