IVG Immobilien AG (IVG) , the German real
estate investment company that hasn’t paid a dividend for five
years, had its biggest-ever decline in Frankfurt trading after
saying it needs to restructure its finances.  IVG dropped as much as  41 percent  to 76 cents, cutting its
market value to about 159 million euros ($204 million). The
Bonn-based company postponed its annual shareholder meeting to
the end of July to develop financing measures and won’t pay a
dividend for 2012, according to a statement today.  “We are already in a difficult market environment
confronted with new additional changes in regulations,  energy
policy  and the economy,” Chief Executive Office Wolfgang Schaefers said in the statement. “We will therefore adapt our
entire financing strategy to the new challenges.”  IVG today reported a net loss of 98.7 million euros for
last year and said its loan-to-value ratio of 70.6 percent, a
measure of indebtedness, was higher than planned. IVG is seeking
an investor in the fund that owns half of the  London  tower known
as the Gherkin, spokesman Oliver Stumm said earlier this month.
That’s after the lenders demanded that IVG reduce debt used to
purchase the building.  “We interpret the statement to mean that IVG will be
seeking to restructure its entire liability and equity
capital,”  Harm Meijer , an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in
London, said in a note to investors today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
