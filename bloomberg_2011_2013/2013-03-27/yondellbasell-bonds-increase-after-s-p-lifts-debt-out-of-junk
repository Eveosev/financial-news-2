The bonds of  LyondellBasell
Industries NV (LYB)  increased after Standard & Poor’s boosted the
largest producer of polypropylene’s unsecured debt out of
speculative grade.  LyondellBasell’s $2 billion of 5 percent notes due April
2019 rose 1.13 cents on the dollar to 112.5 cents, to yield 2.74
percent, at 2:46 p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The company’s $998 million of 6 percent securities
due 2021 rose 1.9 cents to 118.4, to yield 3.5 percent at 3:16
p.m., Trace data show.  S&P raised its rating on the Rotterdam-based chemical
maker’s unsecured notes to BBB- from BB+, according to a report
today, citing “near industry-leading overall adjusted earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization margins of
13 percent and pretax return on capital of 28 percent in 2012.”  LyondellBasell had $4.4 billion of  total debt  as of Dec.
31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Speculative, or
junk, debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and
less than BBB- at S&P.  To contact the reporter on this story:
