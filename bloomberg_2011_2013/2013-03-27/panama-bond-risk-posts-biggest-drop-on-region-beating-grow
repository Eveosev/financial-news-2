Panama ’s bond risk posted the
biggest decline among 11 countries that share its BBB rating as
the fastest economic expansion in Latin America bolstered the
nation’s creditworthiness.  The annual cost of protect against non-payment on
Panamanian dollar debt for five years using credit-default swaps
fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, this year to
94, the lowest of all nations ranked BBB by Standard & Poor’s,
or two levels above junk, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with a surge of 30 basis points on
similar contracts for  Brazil , Latin America’s biggest economy.  Panama’s economy grew 10.7 percent last year, four times
the region’s average, as the Central American nation’s $5.25
billion expansion of the Panama Canal fueled infrastructure
investment. S&P and Moody’s Investors Service raised Panama’s
credit grade last year on speculation the expansion of the
waterway, which handles 5 percent of world trade, will further
propel growth.  “Panama’s story looks solid,” Alejandro Arreaza, an
analyst at Barclays Plc in New York, said in a telephone
interview. “Its growth model is focused on becoming a logistic
and financial center for the region. There are no major risks in
the short term that could reverse this trend.”  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or cash equivalent if the issuer
fails to comply with debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
