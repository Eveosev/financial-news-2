Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG) , the insurer scaling back its life business to focus on
property-casualty coverage, said first-quarter earnings will be
cut by about $200 million as part of a deal to repurchase debt.  The pretax cost is associated with the tender offer for
senior debt with a principal amount of $800 million, according
to a Business Wire statement today from Hartford, which is based
in the Connecticut city of the same name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
