Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
importer of liquefied natural gas, received a cargo from
Belgium, according to ship-tracking data.  The Excel, with a capacity of 135,344 cubic meters, arrived
March 26 at Rio de Janeiro, according to ship transmissions
captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. The tanker sailed from
Zeebrugge, Belgium’s LNG terminal, where it loaded the
supercooled natural gas and departed March 12.  A Petrobras official in Houston didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mail seeking comment outside normal working hours.  Brazil’s driest rainy season in a decade has reduced
hydropower supply, boosting the country’s LNG demand,  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said in a Jan. 28 note. Petrobras, as the
Brazilian oil company is known, has a floating regasification
terminal at Guanabara Bay near Rio de Janeiro.  Brazil doesn’t have long-term LNG supply contracts with
 Belgium , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Belgium
doesn’t produce LNG. The  Zeebrugge  terminal is used by traders
to store and export cargoes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
