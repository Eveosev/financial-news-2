Twenty-two people were injured
yesterday following protests over the construction of a wind
farm owned by Spain’s Gas Natural Fenosa in Mexico’s southern
state of Oaxaca,  Agence France-Presse  reported, citing local
prosecutor Manuel de Jesus Lopez.  Eleven police officers were hurt and one taken prisoner
after trying to reclaim equipment from the Bii Yoxho wind
project, AFP said.  The gear was taken by local protesters on Feb. 25, AFP
said. Locals say construction of the plant is affecting their
fishing and farming activities, AFP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
