The U.K. government failed to
convince an appeals court to deport  Abu Qatada , an Islamic
cleric accused of having links to al-Qaeda, back to his home
country of Jordan.  Three judges rejected an appeal by the U.K. Home Office,
and said the cleric, whose real name is Mohammed Othman, may not
get a fair trial in his native country.  “The court recognizes that Mr. Othman is regarded as a
very dangerous person, but emphasizes that this is not a
relevant consideration” under the law, Judge John Dyson said in
a media summary of the ruling.  The 52-year-old was arrested and returned to jail earlier
this month for breaching bail conditions, which included
restrictions on Internet and mobile-phone use. A lower court
judge ruled last year he shouldn’t be extradited because it
wasn’t clear if evidence attained against him by Jordan was
obtained through torture.  “This is not the end of the road, and the Government
remains determined to deport Abu Qatada,” Britain’s Home Office
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
