Los Angeles Lakers  forward Metta World Peace needs knee surgery and will miss a minimum of six
weeks, taking him out of the lineup for the rest of the regular
season as his team fights for a playoff spot.  World Peace tore the lateral meniscus in his left knee two
days ago while playing against the Golden State Warriors and
will have surgery tomorrow to repair the injury, the Lakers said
on Twitter.  With 11 games left in their season, the Lakers (36-35) are
a game ahead of the Utah Jazz and Dallas Mavericks for the final
playoff spot in the National Basketball Association’s Western
Conference.  The 33-year-old World Peace is averaging 12.8 points and
5.1 rebounds per game this season.  Los Angeles has lost its last three games and plays its
next three on the road, including tonight at the  Minnesota
Timberwolves .  To contact the reporter on this story:
