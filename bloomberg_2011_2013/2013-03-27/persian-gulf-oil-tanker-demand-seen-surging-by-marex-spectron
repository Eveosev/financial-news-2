Following are comments by Marex
Spectron Pte, a Singapore-based broker of oil-freight swaps,
about demand for supertankers to load 2 million barrel cargoes
of crude form ports in the  Persian Gulf .  Marex Spectron commented in an e-mailed report today:  “A stupendous day yesterday with 15 vessels either subs
fixed or on hold added to the demand. This was one of the three
biggest days of the last 12 months from our database. Supply
drops back down to the 81 levels seen late last week.  ‘‘The key here is the Easter break and what will happen
over that break. These levels are well in front of the previous
months of fixing, the Easter break should quickly bring that to
a halt and put the numbers the other way.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
