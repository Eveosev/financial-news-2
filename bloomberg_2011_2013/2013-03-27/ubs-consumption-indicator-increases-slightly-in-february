A measure of Swiss consumer demand
increased slightly in February on better-than-expected new car
registrations and a slight improvement in retail sales,  UBS AG (UBSN) 
said.  The  consumption indicator , which signals developments about
three months ahead, rose to 1.26 points from a revised 1.15
points in January, the Zurich-based bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. The January figure was previously reported as
1.18.  The indicator is based on new car registrations, retail
sales, the number of domestic overnight stays by Swiss
residents,  consumer confidence  and credit-card transactions at
UBS points of sale in Switzerland.  “Retail sales in particular were on the increase, thus
extending the positive trend that has been apparent for a number
of months,” UBS said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
