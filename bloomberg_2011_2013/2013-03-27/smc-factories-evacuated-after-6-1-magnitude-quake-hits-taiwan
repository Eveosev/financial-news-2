Taiwan ’s largest earthquake this
year killed one person and forced rail lines to shut while
factories returned to normal after evacuating employees.  A tremor measuring 6.1 struck the central region of Nantou
county at 10:03 a.m., Taiwan’s Central Weather Bureau  reported ,
shaking buildings in the capital Taipei about 153 kilometers (95
miles) away. At least five aftershocks followed, it said.  Occurring at a depth of 15.4 kilometers, the temblor
centered in the same region as a 1999 quake which measured 7.3

after its emergency response mechanism was triggered. The
company later said it expects no impact from the quake.  A 72-year-old woman died and at least 19 were injured, with

transportation ministry said.  The  U.S. Geological Survey  recorded the earthquake’s
magnitude as 6.0 and occurring at a depth of 20.7 kilometers, it
said on its  website . Today’s was the strongest quake record

Taiwan bureau.  Automatic Evacuations  TSMC, the world’s largest custom manufacturer of chips,
automatically evacuated one plant in Hsinchu, where it is based,
and another in Taichung in central Taiwan, spokesman Michael
