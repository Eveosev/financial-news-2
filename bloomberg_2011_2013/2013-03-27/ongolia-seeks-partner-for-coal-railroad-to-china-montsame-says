The Mongolian government is seeking
a non-state partner to build a 160-mile (260-kilometer) railway
from the Tavan Tolgoi coal field to the Chinese border, the
state-run news agency  Montsame  reported.  The government has accepted bids from 20 companies,
including 14 from overseas, the agency said yesterday, without
identifying any. The partner will take a 49 percent stake in the
project.  Tavan Tolgoi, one of the largest coal deposits in Mongolia,
has an estimated 6.4 billion metric tons of reserves, 70 percent
of it coking coal for steelmaking. Mining companies at the site,
including Hong Kong-listed Mongolia Mining Corp., currently
deliver supplies to the border by truck.  More than one bidder may be chosen, raising the possibility
of a joint venture, Montsame said, citing Prime Minister Norovyn
Altankhuyag. The state-controlled  Development Bank  of Mongolia
LLC will contribute $200 million to the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
