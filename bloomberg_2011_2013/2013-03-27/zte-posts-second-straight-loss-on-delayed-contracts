ZTE Corp. (000063) , China’s second-biggest
maker of mobile-phone equipment, posted its second-straight
quarterly loss due to contract delays and falling handset sales
in China.  The  net loss  of 1.14 billion  yuan  ($183 million) in the
three months ended Dec. 31 compared with net income of 991.6
million yuan a year earlier, based on figures derived from 12-
month results the Shenzhen-based company released in a statement
today.  ZTE said in a preliminary report on Jan. 20 that it would
have a loss for the period because of delays in contracts and
international projects. The full-year loss of 2.84 billion yuan
reported today compared with its January forecast of a loss
between 2.5 billion yuan and 2.9 billion yuan.  Sales in the fourth quarter fell 16 percent to 23.5 billion
yuan.  ZTE  fell  0.1 percent to close at HK$13.96 in Hong Kong
trading before the earnings announcement. The  shares  have gained
6.9 percent so far this year.  The company reported a net loss of 1.95 billion yuan in the
third quarter.  Huawei Technologies Co. is  China ’s largest maker of mobile-
phone equipment.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
