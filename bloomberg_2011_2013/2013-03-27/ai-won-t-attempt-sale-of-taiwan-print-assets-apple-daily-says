Hong Kong billionaire Jimmy Lai
said he won’t attempt to sell his  Taiwan  newspaper and magazine
business again after failing to do so earlier this week, Hong
Kong-based Apple Daily reported today.  Both Apple Daily and Next Magazine’s Taiwan businesses are
profitable, Lai said in an interview published on the paper’s
 Hong Kong website . In a separate interview posted on the paper’s
Taiwan website, he said no job cuts are planned at his Taiwan
business.  The sale by  Next Media Ltd. (282)  collapsed amid protests that
the NT$16 billion ($535 million) deal would silence a critical
voice on China and give the buyers too much control of the
island’s media. Investors led by Tsai Shao-Chung, whose family
owns Taiwan’s China Times Group, proposed to buy Apple Daily,
Sharp Daily and Next Magazine from Next Media.  Taiwan has been ruled separately from  China  since 1949 when
the Kuomintang party fled to the island during a civil war with
Communist forces. Relations between Taiwan and China reached
their warmest in more than six decades as Taiwan President Ma
Ying-jeou focused on economic ties and dropped the pro-
independence rhetoric of his predecessor.  Next Media will continue to sell its Taiwan TV business,
Lai said in the interview with Apple Daily carried on the
paper’s website in Taiwan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
