PT Garuda  Indonesia , the country’s
flag carrier, jumped the most in almost six months in Jakarta
trading after posting 2012 profit that beat analyst estimates.  The  stock  surged 6.3 percent to 680 rupiah as of 11:17 a.m.
local time, poised for the steepest gain since Oct. 1. It was
the third most-active stock in the  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI) ,
which gained 1 percent, poised to close at a record. Trading in
the shares was more than eight times its three-month daily
 average , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The state-owned airline said  net income  rose to $110.6
million from $$63.9 million a year earlier, according to a
statement published in  Bisnis Indonesia  today. That compares
with the $103.5-million median estimate of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Garuda benefited from rising demand at
home and is less exposed to  Europe ’s economic slowdown,
according to PT Bahana Securities.  “Garuda is a completely different animal than most
airlines because most of its  revenues  are from the domestic
market,” Harry Su, head of research at Bahana Securities said
by phone today. “Other airlines are suffering from the slowdown
in Europe whereas Garuda has very minimal routes to Europe.”  The earnings statement didn’t provide reasons for the gain
in profits. Shares of Garuda have risen 3 percent this year,
compared with a 13 percent surge in the Jakarta Composite.  To contact the reporter on this story:
