Wheat rose to the highest in almost
five weeks on speculation that U.S. farmers will plant fewer
acres with spring varieties than forecast due to cold, wet
weather. Corn gained while soybeans fell.  A flood warning is in effect in some regions of  North
Dakota , the largest producer of spring wheat in the U.S.,
according to  National Weather Service . Wheat acreage may climb
to the highest in four years, according to a survey of 32
analysts by  Bloomberg News . Farmers will plant the most soybean
acres ever, and corn seeding may rise to the highest since 1936,
according to the survey.  Seeding “could come in below expectations due to the
unfavorable weather that we’ve been seeing in the northern
spring-wheat states,”  Terry Reilly , a senior commodity analyst
at Chicago-based Futures International LLC, said in a telephone
interview. “The outlook calls for a wet and cold bias for the
northern spring-wheat states and some producers may take that
into account and switch over to other crops, such as hay.”  Wheat futures for May delivery added 1.2 percent to $7.40 a
bushel at 10:53 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest
since Feb. 21.  Corn futures for May delivery advanced 0.5 percent to
$7.3375 a bushel in Chicago. Soybean futures for May delivery
slid less than 0.1 percent to $14.475 a bushel on the CBOT.  To contact the reporters on this story:
