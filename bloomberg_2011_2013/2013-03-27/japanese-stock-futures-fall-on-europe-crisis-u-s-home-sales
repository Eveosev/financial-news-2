Japanese  stock   futures  slid on
concern Europe’s debt crisis is deepening and after pending U.S.
home sales fell, damping earnings prospects for the Asian
nation’s exporters. Australian equities were little changed.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , an electronics
maker that gets 38 percent of its revenue in Europe and the
U.S., fell 0.6 percent from the Tokyo close. Those of  Sharp
Corp. (6753) , the Japanese TV maker forecasting a record loss, lost 6.6
percent after two people familiar with the matter said the
company is seeking investments from private equity funds and
considering selling shares to the public. Shares of  Aluminum
Corp. of China Ltd. , the nation’s largest producer of the light
metal, may be active after reporting a wider second-half loss.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 12,490 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 12,520
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 12,480 in
Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
was little changed today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell 0.1
percent in Wellington.  “The sentiment about Europe is bad,” said Stephen Halmarick, Sydney-based head of investment markets research at
Colonial First State Global Asset Management, which oversees
about $150 billion. “The uncertainty created by a bank bailout
in Cyprus and the inability in Italy to form a government is
weighing on the markets, reminding us of that Europe is going to
be a negative influence for years to come.”  U.S. Housing  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The index slid 0.1 percent in New York yesterday
as fewer Americans signed contracts to purchase previously owned
homes in February.  European governments and the International Monetary Fund
agreed Monday to lend Cyprus 10 billion euros ($13 billion) as
long as the country liquidated its second-largest bank and
forced losses on bank bondholders and deposits of more than
100,000 euros.  Italian 10-year government bond  yields  surged 21 basis
points yesterday, as the nation’s political parties remained at
an impasse after last month’s elections.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 5.2 percent this year
through yesterday on improving U.S. economic data and
speculation that Japan will deploy more stimulus. The Asia
benchmark traded at 15.1 times estimated earnings on average,
compared with 14.1 times for the S&P 500 and 12.6 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. added 0.2 percent to a two-week
high of 92.88.  To contact the reporter on this story:
