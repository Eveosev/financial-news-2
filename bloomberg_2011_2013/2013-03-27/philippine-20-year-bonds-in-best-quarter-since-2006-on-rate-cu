The yield on Philippine 20-year
bonds had its biggest quarterly drop in seven years after the
central bank cut  interest rates  on special-deposit accounts
twice in 2013 and signaled further reductions. The peso rose.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas reduced the rate on the
accounts by about half a percentage point each in January and
March. The monetary authority hasn’t fully utilized the SDA rate,
Governor Amando Tetangco said in a Bloomberg Television
interview on March 15, a day after lowering it to 2.5 percent
from 3 percent and setting a unified rate of 3.5 percent for all
maturities in its reverse-repurchase borrowing facility. Markets
are shut for the Easter break over the next two days.  “The two SDA rate reductions brought down interest rates
across the board and the market expects BSP to make further
cuts,” said  Jonathan Ravelas , the Manila-based chief market
strategist at BDO Unibank Inc., the nation’s largest lender.
“Inflation may be bottoming out and once the central bank is
done with the SDA cuts, probably by the second half, there could
be a bounce in yields.”  The yield on  bonds  due March 2033 fell 2.15 percentage
points this quarter to 3.82 percent, according to midday fixing
prices at Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp. That’s the biggest
quarterly drop since the three months ended March 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate rose four
basis points today from yesterday’s record of 3.78 percent.  The peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 40.995 per dollar at
the noon trading break in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon
Plc. The currency fell to 41.070 yesterday, this year’s lowest
level, and was little changed for the quarter. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, rose nine basis points to 3.66 percent.  Special Accounts  There were 1.9 trillion pesos ($47 billion) in the central
bank’s special-deposit accounts and 280.9 billion pesos in the
reverse-repurchase facility as of March 8,  latest data  show.  “The use of the SDA rate hasn’t been fully exploited or
maximized, so we will be reviewing the situation on a continuing
basis,” Tetangco said on March 15.  Bangko Sentral will soon discuss a plan to ban foreign
funds from placing money in its reverse-repurchase facility,
Assistant Governor Cyd Amador said on March 21. It prohibited
overseas investors from its special-deposit accounts in July.
The central bank will monitor overseas borrowings of Philippine
companies as it encourages the use of domestic funds, Deputy
Governor Diwa Guinigundo told reporters on March 22.  Consumer prices may rise 2.8 percent to 3.7 percent this
month, compared with 3.4 percent in February, Tetangco said this
week. He forecast faster economic growth in 2013 amid manageable
inflation and low interest rates in a March 22 speech e-mailed
by his office yesterday.  The $225 billion economy expanded 6.6 percent in 2012, the
fastest pace in  Asia  after  China . Growth may be 6 percent to 7
percent this quarter, Economic Planning Secretary Arsenio
Balisacan said this week. The government will report March
inflation data on April 5 and first-quarter results on May 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
