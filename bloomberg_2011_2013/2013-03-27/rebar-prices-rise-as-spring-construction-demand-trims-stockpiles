Steel reinforcement-bar rose on
optimism that demand for the material used in housing and
railroads will increase as large construction projects in
northern  China  resume operations after winter.  The contract for delivery in October rose as much as 0.9
percent to 3,916  yuan  ($630) a metric ton on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange, and traded 3,908 yuan at 10:15 a.m. local
time. Futures have declined 9.1 percent since reaching a 10-
month high of 4,297 yuan on Feb. 8.  Building projects including railroads and new apartment
blocks are reopening in the next two weeks, according to a
research report today by Luzheng Futures Co. Inventories of
steel building materials including rebar fell 2 percent from
March 15 to 22.1 million tons, the report said.  “We are seeing signs of returning demand across the
country and declining inventory attests to that,” Ren Xinlei,
analyst at Luzheng Futures, said by phone from Jinan in eastern
China. Resumption of construction activities, delayed about two
weeks by an unusually cold winter, should boost rebar prices, he
said.  The average spot  price  of rebar was little changed at 3,672
yuan a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port rose 0.8 percent
to $137.1 a dry ton yesterday, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
