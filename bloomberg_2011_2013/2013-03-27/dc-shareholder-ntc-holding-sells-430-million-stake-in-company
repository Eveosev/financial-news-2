TDC A/S (TDC)  private-equity shareholder
NTC Holding offered to sell a 2.49 billion-kroner ($430 million)
stake in Denmark’s biggest phone company.  NTC offered 56.3 million shares in TDC, representing a 6.8
percent stake, at 44.27 kroner apiece, according to the terms of
sale obtained by Bloomberg News. Copenhagen-based TDC won’t get
proceeds from the transaction.  UBS AG (UBSN)  was appointed to manage
the sale, carried out through an accelerated bookbuild.  TDC’s private-equity owners have been paring holdings since
December 2010 when they cut their stake to less than 60 percent
from about 88 percent by selling shares to the public. In
February 2012, they sold about 15 percent of the company,
leaving then-bookrunner Morgan Stanley with almost half the
stock. Last month, NTC sold 120 million shares at 39.50 kroner
each after originally offering 80 million shares, a person close
to the deal said at the time.  Five private-equity firms -- Apax Partners LLP,  Blackstone
Group LP (BX) , KKR & Co., Permira Advisers LLP and Providence Equity
Partners Inc. -- formed NTC and bought TDC in 2005 for $15.3
billion.  TDC shares fell 2.2 percent to 44.42 kroner at 9:34 a.m. in
Copenhagen trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
