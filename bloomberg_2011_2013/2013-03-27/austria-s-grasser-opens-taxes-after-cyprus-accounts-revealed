Austria ’s ex-finance minister
released his tax returns after published documents showed that
he used at least six offshore accounts, including three listed
in Cyprus, to manage his businesses.  Karl-Heinz Grasser has appealed an order than he pay 5.4
million euros ($6.9 million) in back taxes, a ruling first
reported by Profil magazine. A review by Grasser’s accountants
at Ernst & Young and a copy of the tax court finding were
provided to weekly magazine  Falter  by his lawyer, Manfred
Ainedter, the attorney confirmed today by telephone.  The former Austrian politician, who worked for billionaire
Frank Stronach before joining government and married into the
Swarovski-crystal family after leaving office, has been the
target of multiple investigations. Serving under ex-Chancellor
Wolfgang Schuessel’s administration, he led Austria’s drive to
privatize state companies from 2000 until 2007.  Setting up the foreign accounts was necessary to protect
Grasser and his family’s finances from media scrutiny, according
to the Ernst & Young assessment. The accounts, which also linked
to firms registered in Liechtenstein and the Virgin Islands, was
necessary to reduce Grasser’s financial risk and shield him from
being sued, the document said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
