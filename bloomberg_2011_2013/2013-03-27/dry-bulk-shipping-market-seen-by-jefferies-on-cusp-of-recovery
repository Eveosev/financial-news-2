Stronger demand for iron ore and
coal shipped by sea, led by record monthly steel production in
China amid slowing  fleet  growth, is poised to end a downturn in
dry-bulk shipping, said Jefferies Group Inc.  “The dry-bulk shipping market could very well be on the
cusp of a sustained, cyclical recovery,” the New York-based
investment bank said in a quarterly report e-mailed today.  Fleet growth at 5 percent to 6 percent this year amid
increased production of iron ore, a steelmaking raw material,
“will likely be insufficient to absorb the incremental demand”
by miners in the second half of 2013, Jefferies said. The
outlook for the industry is “increasingly attractive,” with
global dry-bulk trade estimated to grow by at least 6 percent in
2013, Jefferies said  Hire costs for the world fleet of 1,513 Capesizes, the
largest ships used to carry iron ore and coal, averaged $7,680 a
day last year compared with $106,068 in 2008, according to the
Baltic Exchange, the London-based assessor of freight costs.
Rates will increase to $12,000 this year and $20,000 in 2014,
Jefferies said.  Still, the dry-bulk market remains “challenging” amid a
slowdown in trade growth in recent months, with Capesize single-
voyage hires declining to 82 in February from 125 in October,
the bank said.  The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a measure of costs to transport
minerals and grains by sea, fell 1 percent to 922, figures from
the exchange showed today. Daily average returns for Capesizes
slid 2.7 percent to $4,763.  Among the three classes of smaller vessels tracked by the
index, average returns for Panamaxes, the biggest ships to
navigate the  Panama Canal , fell 1.1 percent to $9,527 a day,
according to the exchange. Supramaxes retreated 1.2 percent to
$10,094 and Handysizes, the smallest vessels in the gauge, rose
for a 25th session to $8,108.  To contact the reporter on this story:
