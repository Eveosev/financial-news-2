Swedish  consumer confidence 
improved more than estimated in March as stock markets rose and
the economy showed signs of stabilizing.  The  consumer confidence  index rose to 2.8 from minus 1 the
previous month, the Stockholm-based National  Institute of
Economic Research  said today. Economists predicted confidence
would improve to 1, according to the median of 10 forecasts in a
Bloomberg  survey . A  manufacturing confidence  index improved to
minus 10 from minus 11. It was estimated to gain to minus 8.  “The improvement was due to an increasingly positive view
of the Swedish economy,” the NIER said.  Sweden ’s central bank last month forecast it won’t have to
cut its main lending rate further, citing signs of an improving
economy as financial markets stabilized following the European
Central Bank’s pledge to buy bonds of debt-stricken countries.  The Riksbank left its  main lending rate  unchanged at 1
percent last month following four cuts in a year to boost growth
in the  export-dependent  economy. The benchmark OMX index has
gained 8.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
