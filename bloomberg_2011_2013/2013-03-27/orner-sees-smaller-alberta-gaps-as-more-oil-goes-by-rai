Alberta’s deficits for this fiscal
year and next will be less than the province forecast in its
March 7 budget as Canadian oil trades higher relative to world
benchmarks, said Finance Minister Doug Horner.  The  difference  in the price of Western  Canada  Select, a
blend of heavy Canadian oil refined from bitumen, compared with
West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, has narrowed 36
percent since Horner delivered the  budget  three weeks ago.
Horner attributed the narrowing gap to the increased use of rail
shipments.  Alberta, which sits on the world’s third-largest pool of
crude reserves, relies on royalties and taxation of the oil and
natural gas industry for about a third of its revenue.  “We’re looking very conservative in our numbers,” Horner
said today during an interview at Bloomberg’s Toronto office.
“Our year-end is going to look better than anticipated.”  The oil-sands benchmark, West Canada select, traded at
$80.83 a barrel at 1:05 p.m. in  New York , or $15.25 less than
U.S. crude. The gap reached a record $42.50 on Dec. 14.  Alberta, the wealthiest of Canada’s 10 provinces, expects
2.9 percent economic growth in 2013, and an average of C$68.21
per barrel for the benchmark Western Canada Select.  The province will probably post a narrower shortfall for
the fiscal year ending March 31 than the budget forecast of
C$3.9 billion ($3.8 billion), Horner said, declining to provide
a new projection.  Borrowing Requirement  On March 7, he reduced his forecasts for resource revenue
this fiscal year and next by C$10.2 billion, or 12 percent of
total revenue over two years.  Alberta will borrow C$3.19 billion in 2013-14, and bring
forward C$1.07 billion borrowed in 2012-13 to help pay for
C$5.21 billion in  capital spending , including 50 new schools,
widening the highway to Fort McMurray, the oil sands boom town,
and new health care facilities.  The western province has C$16.6 billion in outstanding
bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, with about C$2.7
billion of that due in 2013. Alberta’s debt is rated AAA, the
highest level, with a stable outlook by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
