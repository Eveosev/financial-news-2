PDG Realty SA (PDGR3) ,  Brazil ’s third-
biggest homebuilder by market value, jumped after executives
told analysts that the company plans to sell assets and cut
costs.  Shares jumped 5.4 percent to 3.13 reais at 12:47 p.m. in
Sao Paulo, the best performance on the benchmark Bovespa index.
PDG officials informed analysts of their plans to reduce costs
on a conference call today to discuss their fourth-quarter loss,
according to Alvaro Bandeira, a partner at Orama Asset
Management who participated on the call.  It was “positive,” Bandeira said.  A PDG press official didn’t immediately return a phone call
seeking comment.  PDG fell as much as 4.4 percent earlier today after
reporting that its losses widened in the fourth quarter. The
company posted an adjusted net loss of 1.79 billion reais ($890
million) from 20.4 million reais in the year-earlier period,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  PDG has slid 5.4 percent this year while the Bovespa
declined 8.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
