Alcoa Inc. (AA)  and  General Motors Co. (GM) 
agreed to a $21.2 million settlement to rehabilitate a polluted
stretch of the St. Lawrence River adjacent to land owned by the
St. Regis Mohawk Tribe.  Alcoa will pay $19.4 million, and $18.5 million of that
will go toward restoration efforts, the tribe said in a
 statement  today. An additional $1.8 million will come from a
2011 General Motors bankruptcy fund.  About $12 million will be used to restore grasslands,
wetlands, fisheries and river access near Massena, New York,
along the Canadian border, and $8.4 million will support
traditional cultural practices. The tribe and three government
agencies will also be reimbursed for their costs.  Discharges from Alcoa and General Motors factories in the
region into the St. Lawrence river included polychlorinated
biphenyls and other potential carcinogens, according to the
statement.  The  settlement  “will increase public access to fishing,
protect wildlife and help to restore the health and economic
vitality of the St. Lawrence River and its tributaries,”  New
York  State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in the
statement.  “This is a positive step to bring resolution to the
natural resources damages assessment process, and is a win for
the community,” Lori Lecker, an Alcoa spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail. “Alcoa will undertake several ecological and cultural
restoration projects, including purchasing approximately 465
acres that will become part of the Coles Creek State Park and
Wilson Hill Wildlife Management Area.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
