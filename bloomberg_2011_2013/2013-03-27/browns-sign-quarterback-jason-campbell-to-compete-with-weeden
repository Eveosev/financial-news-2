The Cleveland Browns signed free-
agent quarterback Jason Campbell, a former first-round draft
pick who’s started 71 career National Football League games and
was a backup with the Chicago Bears last season.  Campbell, 31, received a two-year contract and will
probably compete with  Brandon Weeden  for the starting job under
new Browns coach Rob Chudzinski and offensive coordinator Norv Turner. Colt McCoy, who was a backup to Weeden last season, is
expected to be released or traded, the Cleveland Plain Dealer
said, citing an unidentified person familiar with the situation.  “Jason is an established leader who has started a number
of games in this league and has had success,” Chudzinski said
in a statement. “He brings us a veteran presence and a good set
of physical tools. He played in a similar system when he was in
Oakland and that will help in his transition.”  Campbell started 52 games with the Washington Redskins from
2006-09 before joining the Oakland Raiders in 2010-11. A first-
round pick in 2005, he’s completed 60.9 percent of his passes
for 14,682 yards, 76 touchdowns and 52 interceptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
