Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  is revamping the
Highlander sport-utility vehicle, turning the car-based
crossover into a more wagon-like model as the carmaker seeks to
keep its U.S. sales rising for a third consecutive year.  The third-generation Highlander, unveiled today at the  New
York  International Auto Show, is lower, longer and wider than
the model it replaces early next year, the company said today in
a statement. The three-row vehicle will be able to carry as many
as eight people and comes with a four- or six-cylinder gasoline
engine or a V-6 hybrid, Toyota said.  The redesign gives the 2014 Highlander a “sleeker,” more
“sophisticated” appearance and a new six-speed transmission
aids performance and  fuel efficiency , the Toyota City, Japan-
based company said in the statement today. Interior enhancements
include stitched seats and a soft-touch dashboard.  Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, expects U.S. auto
demand to reach 15.3 million cars and light trucks this year,
about 5.5 percent more than in 2012. While the company plans to
lead car sales for a 12th consecutive year with its Camry sedan,
the current Highlander trails competing midsize car-based
crossovers including  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s Explorer and Edge models,
and  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Equinox.  The company didn’t immediately provide pricing and volume
goals for the new Highlander that will be built solely at its
Princeton, Indiana, plant. Sales of the model this year through
February rose 21 percent to 18,141.  By comparison, Ford boosted Explorer sales 60 percent to
32,598 and Edge sales rose 2.4 percent to 19,297, according to
Autodata Corp. Equinox deliveries grew 20 percent through
February to 37,872.  Toyota’s U.S. sales unit is based in Torrance, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
