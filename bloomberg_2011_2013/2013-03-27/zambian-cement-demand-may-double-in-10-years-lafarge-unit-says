Zambian demand for cement may
double over the next 10 years, according to the local unit of
 Lafarge SA (LG) , the world’s biggest producer of the building and
construction material.  The average pace of growth will probably be more than 10
percent a year until 2018, after a 13.2 percent increase last
year,  Chrissie Moloseni, acting chief executive officer of
 Lafarge Cement Zambia Plc (LACZ) , said in an interview in the capital
Lusaka today. “If anything, we’re seeing more projects” than
previous years.  Lafarge’s Zambian unit, in which the Paris-based company
holds an 84 percent stake, is seeking to take advantage of state
efforts to develop power and transportation infrastructure in
 Africa ’s largest copper producer. The government raised $750
million through the sale of its maiden Eurobond last year to
fund construction of roads, railways and power plants.  Lafarge Cement Zambia has a 68 percent market share in the
country, Moloseni said. The southern African nation uses about
1.4 million tons of cement a year, according to Kaziwe Kaulule,
the company’s marketing director.  There will probably be an oversupply of cement once the 1.5
million ton plant being built by  Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM) , Africa’s
biggest producer, comes on stream, Moloseni said. The $400
million plant is expected to begin production later this year,
according to Dangote’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
