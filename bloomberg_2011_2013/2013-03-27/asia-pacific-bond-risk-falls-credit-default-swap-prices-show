Sunac China Holdings Ltd. (1918)  is
marketing a sale of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds as notes sold
by fellow developer  Beijing Capital Land Ltd. (2868)  rose on their
first day of trading. Bond risk in the Asia-Pacific region fell.  Sunac, based in Tianjin,  China , plans to sell five-year
securities at a yield of about 9.75 percent, a person familiar
with the matter said. Debt sold by Beijing Capital Land that has
no fixed maturity rose to 101 cents on the dollar as of 11:38
a.m. in Hong Kong after pricing yesterday at par, according to
prices quoted by BNP Paribas SA and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Citic Pacific Ltd. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
also plan to sell U.S. currency bonds.  The cost of insuring Asian corporate and sovereign bonds
against non-payment has fallen 2.3 basis points this week, on
track for its biggest drop since the five-day period ending
March 8, according to traders of credit-default swaps. Beijing
Capital Land, a builder of luxury residential apartments, and
 Greentown China Holdings Ltd. (3900)  raised $700 million yesterday in
the first sales by Chinese real-estate developers in two weeks,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “I do think we will see more supply after Easter,” said
Mark Reade, a Hong Kong-based credit desk analyst at Credit
Agricole CIB. “Most Chinese developers continue to have a
strong appetite for U.S. dollar funding and as we make our way
through earnings season, we’re sure to see more developers come
to market.”  Greentown Rises  Asia-Pacific issuers have sold almost $3 billion of bonds
in the U.S. currency this week, bringing sales this month to
$23.9 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares
with $10.7 billion of issuance in the same period of February
and $29.7 billion in January, the data show.  Greentown announced on March 24 that 2012 net income rose
88 percent to 4.85 billion  yuan  ($781 million) versus the
previous corresponding period. The company sold more of its 8.5
percent notes due February 2018 yesterday at 102.5 cents on the
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities
were trading at 102.7 cents as of 5:22 p.m. in  Hong Kong ,
Bloomberg prices show.  Citic Pacific is offering seven-year debt at 6.375 percent,
a separate person familiar with the matter said, also asking not
to be identified because the terms aren’t set. Taiwan
Semiconductor plans raise as much as $1.5 billion from a sale of
three-year bonds at about 75 basis points more than Treasuries
and five-year notes at an about 95 basis-point spread, according
to Elizabeth Sun, a spokeswoman at the company.  SmarTone Offering  SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings Ltd., which provides
mobile telecommunication services in Hong Kong, is marketing 10-
year securities at a yield premium of 210 basis points to 215
basis points, according to another person.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  decreased 1.5 basis points to 118.5 as
of 8:21 a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The benchmark has ranged from 100.5 to 120.8 since
Dec. 31, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slid 1 basis point to 119
as of 10:57 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices show.
The measure rolled to a new series on March 20 and closed at
121.1 on that day, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-
Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 109
basis points as of 9:05 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The gauge has ranged from 101 to 148.1 this year,
according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
