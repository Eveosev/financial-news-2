Asian shares  rose after U.S. home
prices climbed the most since 2006 and orders for durable goods
beat estimates. Gains by Japanese shares were limited as about
80 percent of the companies in the  Topix (TPX)  Index traded without
rights to a dividend today.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , a supplier of building
materials that counts the U.S. as its biggest market, gained 1.2
percent in Sydney.  China  Communications Construction Co., which
helped build sections of the new San Francisco Bay Bridge,

of 7:53 p.m. in Tokyo, with about two shares rising for each
that fell. Just two groups out of the 10 industries on the Asia-
Pacific measure declined today. The MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan
Index advanced 0.6 percent to 473.79, while the Topix added 0.2
percent to 1,046.47.  “Stocks would’ve risen a lot without shares going ex-
dividend,” said Koji Toda, chief fund manager at Resona Bank
Ltd. in  Tokyo , which oversees about 15 trillion yen ($158
billion). “The U.S. is experiencing the best scenario in that
its economy is going strong while risk remains for the rest of
the world, namely  Europe .”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 4.8 percent this year
through yesterday on improving economic data from the U.S. and
speculation that Japan will deploy more stimulus. The Asia
benchmark traded at 15 times estimated earnings on average,
compared with 14.2 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
12.6 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Philippine Upgrade  Gains in Japanese shares were limited because 1,330 of the
1,696 companies on the Topix if bought today wouldn’t receive a
 dividend  for the most recent period. Among them was  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) , the world’s No. 1 carmaker, which fell 0.2 percent to
4,900 yen.  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index jumped 2.7 percent to a
record after Fitch Ratings gave the Southeast Asian nation its
first investment-grade debt rating.  South Korea’s Kospi Index gained 0.5 percent as the
nation’s consumer sentiment index rose this month to the highest
since May 2012.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.9 percent and New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index advanced 1.5 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.7 percent as Li Ka-
shing, Asia’s richest man and owner of developer Cheung Kong
Holdings Ltd., backed property curbs by the government.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index added 0.2 percent, while
 Singapore ’s Straits Times Index gained 0.8 percent.  Taiwan’s
Taiex Index (TWSE)  advanced 0.5 percent even as a magnitude 6.1
earthquake shook parts of the island.  Durables Orders  Futures on the S&P 500 Index added 0.1 percent. The U.S.
equity gauge rose 0.8 percent in New York yesterday as
residential real estate prices increased in January by the most
since June 2006, according to the  S&P/Case-Shiller index . Orders
for U.S. durable goods climbed more than forecast in February,
rising the most since September, according to a Commerce
Department report.  “Average U.S. investors feel more secure about their jobs,
seeing their house prices go up, and think the crisis is well
behind them,” said  Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief investment
strategist at Russell Investment Group, which manages about $160
billion. “We like  emerging markets  and Asia simply because,
even though there’s concern about Chinese policy tightening,
earnings numbers still look good.”  Companies that do business in the U.S. advanced, with James
Hardie climbing 1.2 percent to A$9.82 in Sydney.      Techtronic

its biggest market, gained 2.8 percent to HK$19.22 in Hong Kong.
Panasonic Corp., Japan’s second-biggest television maker, jumped
5.2 percent to 708 yen in Tokyo.  Chinese Earnings  China Communications Construction gained 7.3 percent to
HK$7.10 after posting full-year profit of 12.2 billion  yuan ,
exceeding the average estimate of 11.3 billion yuan by 16
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank of China advanced 2 percent to HK$3.62 after net
income rose to 139.4 billion yuan ($22 billion) from a restated
124.3 billion yuan a year earlier, beating the 132.6 billion-
yuan average estimate of 31 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd., Japan’s second-biggest
tire maker, jumped 4.4 percent to 1,575 yen after its equity
rating was raised to outperform at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley

Topix after a report Aeon Co. will buy shares at a discount to
raise its stake in the supermarket operator. Daiei slumped 9.8
percent to 286 yen and Aeon,  Japan ’s biggest retailer, jumped
6.3 percent to 1,226 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
