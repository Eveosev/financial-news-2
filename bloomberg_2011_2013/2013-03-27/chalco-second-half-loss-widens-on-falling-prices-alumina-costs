Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the
nation’s biggest producer, reported a wider second-half loss
because of falling prices and higher costs for alumina, which is
used to produce the lightweight metal.  The net loss was 4.98 billion  yuan  ($801 million) in the
six months ended Dec. 31, from a loss of 174.6 million yuan a
year earlier. The result was derived by deducting six-month
figures from full-year earnings released today in a statement.  The Beijing-based company today reported a full-year loss
of 8.23 billion yuan in 2012, wider than the 5.4 billion yuan
median estimate of analysts  compiled  by Bloomberg. Today’s
results come after Chalco said in January it had a
“substantial” loss as alumina production costs rose 4 percent
and prices for aluminum metal were about 7 percent lower than a
year ago.  “The slowdown in China economic growth and the macro
control policies on real estate resulted in a slowdown of growth
of aluminum consumption in  China  in 2012,” Chalco said in the
statement, citing that building, transportation and power
industries accounted for approximately two-thirds of the
aluminum consumption in China.  The pressure of over-supply of aluminum is still strong
this year, the company said in the statement today.  Chalco shares added 0.3 percent to close at HK$3.13 today
in Hong Kong before the earnings announcement. Chalco has
declined 18 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 6.7
percent gain in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
