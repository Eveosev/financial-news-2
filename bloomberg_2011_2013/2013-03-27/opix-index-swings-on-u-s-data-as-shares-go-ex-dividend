Japanese shares climbed after U.S.
home prices and durable goods orders rose faster than estimated.
Gains were limited as most stocks on the  Topix Index (TPX)  traded
without rights to a dividend.  Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets 27 percent of its
sales from the Americas, advanced 0.9 percent.  Square Enix
Holdings Co. (9684) , the maker of the Final Fantasy games, slumped 8.9
percent after reversing its profit forecast to a 13 billion yen
loss. Daiei Inc. fell the most on the Topix after a report Aeon
Co. will buy shares at a discount to raise its stake in the
supermarket operator.  The Topix rose 0.2 percent to 1,046.47 at the close in
 Tokyo , reversing a loss of as much as 0.2 percent. Shares of
1,330 companies on the 1,696-member gauge if bought today won’t
receive a dividend for the most recent period. The Nikkei 225
Stock Average climbed 0.2 percent to 12,493.79, with volume 34
percent lower than the 30-day average.  “Shares would be higher today but the ex-dividend price
adjustment is shaving about nine points off the Topix and about
100 yen from the Nikkei 225,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , chief
strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co., which oversees the
equivalent of about 1.8 trillion yen ($19 billion). “U.S.
housing prices are rising steadily and that’s raising
expectation that demand will increase. Japanese exporters had
been rising on expectations for improved earnings.”  The Topix rallied 45 percent from Nov. 14, when elections
were announced that brought Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to power
on a platform of increased stimulus and central bank easing. The
gauge is trading at 1.2 times book value, compared with 2.2 for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Optimism  Futures on the  S&P 500  were unchanged. The equity measure
yesterday rebounded to within two points of its record after
U.S. home prices increased in January by the most since June
2006, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index released. Orders
for U.S. durable goods climbed more than forecast in February,
propelled by automobiles and a rebound in commercial aircraft, a
Commerce Department report showed.  Exporters rose today after the yen fell 0.3 percent against
the dollar. A weaker Japanese currency boosts overseas earnings
at exporters when repatriated.  Canon, the world’s biggest camera maker, gained 0.9 percent
to 3,525 yen.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which counts  North America  as its
top market, rose 1.1 percent to 3,660 yen.  Square Enix slumped 8.9 percent to 1,009 yen, its lowest
level on record. The gamemaker yesterday forecast a 13 billion
yen loss for this fiscal year, compared with its previous
forecast for a 3.5 billion yen profit.  Daiei Offer  Daiei tumbled 9.8 percent to 286 yen. Aeon will raise its
stake in the retailer by as much as 40 percent, offering about
270 yen a share, the Nikkei newspaper reported. The bid is about
15 percent below Daiei’s closing price yesterday. Aeon jumped
6.3 percent to 1,226 yen, reaching its highest level since
August 2008.  Sharp Corp. dropped 4.1 percent, the  biggest decline  on the
 Nikkei 225. (NKY)  Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. missed the deadline
to complete an investment agreement with the unprofitable maker
of Aquos televisions.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 2.3 percent
to 25.72 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.4
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
