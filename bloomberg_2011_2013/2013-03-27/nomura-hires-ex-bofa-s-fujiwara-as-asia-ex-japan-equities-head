Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  hired Yasuhiro Fujiwara, a former  Bank of America Corp.  veteran, as head of
equities for Asia excluding Japan, according to a memo obtained
by  Bloomberg News .  Fujiwara will also be head of equity derivatives trading
for Asia-Pacific, the memo said. He left Bank of America as co-
head of Asia-Pacific global markets in 2011.  Rob Stewart , a Hong
Kong spokesman at Nomura, confirmed the content of the document.  Japan’s biggest securities firm said in September it is
reorganizing the equities division into three segments, with
overseas execution services to be wrapped into its independent
Instinet unit, the brokerage it acquired in 2006. The Tokyo-
based bank last week hired Shaun Bramham as chief executive
officer of Instinet’s Asia-Pacific business.  Fujiwara will be based in Hong Kong and will join Nomura’s
global markets leadership team as well as the Asia executive
management committee, according to the memo. With more than 20
years of experience building global business in Asia, he helped
Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit establish its equities
franchise in the region, Nomura said in the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
