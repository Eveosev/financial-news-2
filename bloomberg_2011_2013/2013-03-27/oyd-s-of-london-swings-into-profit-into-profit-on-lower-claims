Lloyd’s of London , the world’s
oldest insurance market, swung into profit last year as costs
linked to  Hurricane Sandy  failed to exceed claims in 2011.  The full-year pretax profit of 2.77 billion pounds ($4.2
billion) compared with a 516 million-pound loss in 2011, the
London-based market said today in a statement. Lloyd’s central
fund, which pays claims if an insurer fails, rose 4.1 percent to
2.5 billion pounds.  Sandy, which struck the east coast of the U.S. in October
and was the third-most costly natural disaster on record
according to  Munich Re , cost Lloyd’s $2.2 billion, about 10
percent of the industry’s total loss. Lloyd’s paid 10.1 billion
pounds in claims in 2012, down from 12.9 billion pounds in 2011,
following earthquakes in  Japan  and  New Zealand , and flooding in
 Thailand .  “The Lloyd’s market has posted a strong result,” Chief
Executive Officer Richard Ward said in a statement.  The market paid out 91.1 pence in claims and operating
expenses for every pound it took in premiums, indicating an
underwriting profit, it said. That compares with 107 pence for
U.S. property and casualty insurers, 91 pence for Bermudan
insurers and 98 pence for European insurers and reinsurers,
Lloyd’s said.  Premiums rose 9 percent to 25.5 billion pounds in 2012, in
part due to a 3 percent increase in rates following the
disasters of 2011, Lloyd’s said.  Surplus Capital  Insurers such as  Hiscox Ltd. (HSX)  and  Beazley Plc (BEZ)  are returning
capital to shareholders by paying special dividends after
profits increased in 2012. That’s evidence that insurers are
becoming more responsible and aren’t chasing sales at the
expense of profitability, Luke Savage, Lloyd’s finance director,
said in an interview.  “They’re not flooding the industry with surplus capital
that would otherwise drive prices down and make the industry
uncompetitive,” he said. “Historically this is an industry
that’s highly cyclical and would go from boom to bust. It’s
encouraging that in recent years it’s been far more
disciplined.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
