Dongfeng Motor Group Co. (489) , China’s
biggest maker of Japanese-branded cars, reported full-year
profit that beat analyst estimates even as sales declined.  Net income fell 13 percent to 9.1 billion  yuan  ($1.5
billion), the Wuhan, China-based company said in a statement to
the Hong Kong stock exchange today. That surpassed the 8.4
billion yuan average of 31 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales fell 5.6 percent to 124 billion yuan.  Dongfeng is recovering from Chinese consumer aversion
toward its Japanese partners’ products after a wave of protests
erupted in September due to the territorial dispute between
China and Japan over a group of islands in the  East China Sea .
Both Nissan and Honda said traffic and demand were on the uprise
at the end of last year.  China’s auto industry was “under a slow growth in 2012,”
Xu Ping, Dongfeng’s chairman, said in the earnings statement.
“The growth in of general consumption market provided momentum
and tremendous room for improvement.”  Dongfeng rose 2.9 percent to HK$10.56 at the close of
trading in  Hong Kong  before the results were announced. The
shares are down 12 percent so far this year.  Passenger-vehicle sales increased 5.7 percent to 1.7
million units, while commercial vehicle sales dropped 21.2
percent to 414,754 units, according to the statement.  Besides Japanese brands Nissan and Honda, Dongfeng is
partnered with France’s PSA Peugeot Citroen to produce cars in
China.  Dongfeng signed an agreement in December with another
French automaker,  Renault SA (RNO) , to build a 7 billion yuan
production facility in Wuhan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
