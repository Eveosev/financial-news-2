China Life Insurance Co. (2628) , the
nation’s biggest insurer, said profit slumped for a second
consecutive year amid mounting investment losses.  Net income  fell 40 percent to 11.06 billion  yuan  ($1.8
billion), or 0.39 yuan a share, from 18.3 billion yuan, or 0.65
yuan a share a year earlier, the company said in a statement to
Shanghai stock exchange. That compares with the 11.07 billion
yuan mean estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  China’s benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped about 20
percent in the past two years as the nation’s economic expansion
cooled, eroding insurers’ investment returns and forcing them to
write down on some equity holdings. Smaller competitor  Ping An
Insurance (Group) Co. (2318)  reported a 3 percent profit increase this
month as bigger banking revenue helped offset an almost tenfold
jump in net realized and unrealized investment losses last year.  China  Life’s investment performance “hasn’t been
particularly desirable and lags far behind investor
expectations,” said Xie Jiyong, a Shanghai-based analyst at
 Capital Securities Corp. (6005)  before the earnings were announced.
“They should have digested almost all the unrealized losses by
the end of last year though, and are very likely to record an
increase in profit this year.”  Investment Losses  Impairment losses from equity investments jumped 140
percent to 31.1 billion yuan last year, the company said.
Investment income, mainly interest earned from bonds holdings
and  bank deposits , rose 23 percent to 80 billion yuan, according
to the statement. The company said Feb. 28 that profit probably
dropped about 40 percent in 2012 on lower investment yields and
increased impairment losses because of weakness in  capital
markets .  The Shanghai Composite fell 5.2 percent in the first three
quarters of last year, before rallying 8.8 percent in the fourth
quarter as the nation’s  economic growth  gained momentum. The
gauge has risen 1.4 percent this year.  Ping An’s net investment losses jumped to 9.5 billion yuan
last year, while impairment losses more than doubled as the
company reflected the decreased values in its stock holdings
under accounting rules that require such recognitions when
investments fall more than 50 percent or have been at a loss for
a year, the insurer’s Chief Investment Officer Timothy Chan told
reporters in Shanghai March 15.  Net premiums earned climbed 1.2 percent to 322 billion
yuan, China Life said. The value of new business, which gauges
profitability of new policies sold, expanded 3.1 percent,
according to the statement.  China Life fell 0.2 percent to HK20.70 in Hong Kong
trading, extending this year’s decline to 18.2 percent.  China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co. (2601) , the nation’s third-
largest insurer, on March 24 reported a 39 percent drop in
profit for last year as investment losses more than doubled and
impairments jumped 57 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
