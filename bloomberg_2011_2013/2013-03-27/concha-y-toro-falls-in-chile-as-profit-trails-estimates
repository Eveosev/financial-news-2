Vina Concha y Toro SA ,  Chile ’s
largest wine exporter, fell to its lowest level in two months
after reporting profits that trailed analyst estimates.  Concha y Toro  declined 0.2 percent to 963.4 pesos at 1:51
p.m. in Santiago and earlier slid to 936.8 pesos, its lowest
intraday price since Jan. 30. The  Ipsa (IPSA)  benchmark index retreated
0.4 percent.  The company reported annual profit of 30 billion pesos ($64
million), below an average  estimate  of 35.6 billion pesos,
according to a Bloomberg survey of four analysts. It said
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or
Ebitda, reached 53.4 billion pesos, versus an estimate of 58.8
billion pesos.  Concha y Toro’s margins contracted in the period as the
peso strengthened versus the Brazilian real and the euro and as
bulk grape prices rose, Banchile Inversiones said in an e-mailed
note today.  “Administrative costs also rose, as the company opened new
commercial offices,” Banchile said. “We can’t rule out
downward pressure on the stock.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
