Banks in Portugal, Spain and Italy
may come under funding pressure after a deal earlier this week
in Cyprus rescued the island’s financial system at the expense
of bank creditors, the Institute of International Finance said.  European governments and the International Monetary Fund
agreed two days ago to loan Cyprus 10 billion euros ($12.8
billion) as long as the country liquidated its second-largest
bank and forced losses on bank bondholders and deposits of more
than 100,000 euros.  “This new approach is apt to put funding stresses on banks
in weaker economies -- especially Portugal, Spain and Italy,”
the Washington-based  association  of the biggest commercial and
investment banks said today in a report. “Instead of severing
the link between bank and sovereign balance sheets, the Cyprus
deal will have deepened these links: Banks exposed to weak
sovereigns will have their depositors and creditors haircut,
pulling down the economy and public finances.”  Cyprus may impose controls on money transfers before its
banks are scheduled to reopen tomorrow. The country’s leaders
are seeking to prevent the flight of money from the island’s
lenders, which have been closed for almost two weeks.  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi pledged in
July to do “whatever it takes” to protect the euro.  “It is plausible that markets have too much confidence in
ECB support and now, once again, underpricing some form of
break-up risk,” IIF said in its report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
