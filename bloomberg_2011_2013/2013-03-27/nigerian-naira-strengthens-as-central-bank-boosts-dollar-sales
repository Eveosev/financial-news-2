The naira erased its loss and
gained for the first time in three days after the central bank
raised the amount of U.S. currency sold at an auction today.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest economy
strengthened 0.1 percent to 158.20 per dollar by 3 p.m. in
Lagos, the commercial capital, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier depreciated to 158.40 per dollar.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $300 million to lenders at
an auction today, compared with $276.6 million at the previous
sale on March 25, the Abuja-based bank said in e-mailed
statement. The regulator uses the sales to stabilize the naira
as the cost of importing goods including refined fuel, which
accounts for 70 percent of the local gasoline market, increases
dollar demand and puts pressure on the currency.  “CBN’s increased intervention through the auction has
ensured naira stays within the targeted band amid increased
dollar demand,” Sewa Wusu, an analyst at Lagos-based Sterling
Capital Ltd., said by phone.  The central bank aims to keep the currency of Africa’s
biggest oil producer within a band of 3 percent above or below
155 naira per dollar.  In the week ahead, the naira may gain to 158.10 per dollar,
“with bias for moderate appreciation due to monetary policy
support,” Kunle Ezun and Kenneth Asenime, analysts at Ecobank
Transnational Inc. in Lagos, wrote in an e-mailed note to
clients today.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 dropped one basis point to 11.20 percent in the
secondary market, according to yesterday’s data compiled on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on
 Nigeria ’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 rose one
basis point to 4.323 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi gained 0.2 percent to 1.9370 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
