Niko Resources Ltd. (NKO) , the Canadian
oil and natural gas explorer with operations in Bangladesh,
Pakistan and India, rose the most in three months after saying
it’s in negotiations to sell C$157 million ($154 million) worth
of assets.  The shares gained 10 percent to C$5.82 at the close in
Toronto, the most since Dec. 27. The stock has  declined  45
percent this year.  Niko is in “advanced negotiations” with two potential
buyers, the Calgary-based company said today in a statement. It
aims to complete the agreements by the end of next month.  The company may exit some national markets as it completes
the sales process, Chief Financial Officer Glen Valk said in a
phone interview. He declined to say which assets are being sold.  Niko also operates in  Madagascar , Trinidad and  Indonesia ,
according to the company website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
