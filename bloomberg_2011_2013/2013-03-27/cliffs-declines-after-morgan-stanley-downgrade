Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF) , the
largest U.S. iron-ore miner, tumbled the most in six weeks after
analysts at Morgan Stanley said new supply in  North America  may
reduce the commodity’s price.  Cliffs fell 12 percent to $18.94 at 9:41 a.m. in New York,
after earlier dropping 15 percent, the most intraday since Feb.
13.  The shares  have declined 51 percent this year, making it the
year’s worst  performer  on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
Cliffs, based in  Cleveland , plunged 20 percent on Feb. 13 after
the company said it would cut its dividend and issue shares amid
slumping global iron-ore prices and cost overruns at its
flagship Canadian mine.  Analysts led by Evan Kurtz at Morgan Stanley in New York
expect the price of the steelmaking ingredient to drop to $110 a
ton as about 13 million tons of  iron-ore  pellet supply comes
online in the North American Great Lakes region, a 60 million-
ton market, they wrote in a note today.  Iron ore  traded at the
Chinese port of Tianjin rose 0.2 percent to $137.40 a dry metric
ton today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from The
Steel Index, a trade publication.  Kurtz downgraded his rating on Cliffs to underweight,
equivalent to sell, from the equivalent of hold.  Sal Tharani, a New York-based analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., upgraded his rating to hold from sell after the
company’s actions shored up its balance sheet, he said in a note
published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
