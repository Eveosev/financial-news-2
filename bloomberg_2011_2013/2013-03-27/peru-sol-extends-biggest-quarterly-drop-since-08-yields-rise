Peru ’s sol declined, extending its
biggest quarterly drop since 2008, after the central bank
increased  reserve requirements  to prevent dollar inflows from
fueling gains in the local currency.  The sol depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.59 per  U.S. dollar  at
12:45 p.m. in Lima, extending its drop over the past three
months to 1.4 percent, according to prices from Datatec. The
local market will be closed for a holiday tomorrow and March 29.  Banco Central de Reserva del Peru said today the reserve
ratio will rise by 0.25 percentage point for lenders who have
less than 50 percent of their U.S. currency holdings at the
central bank. The move, effective April 1, will probably curb
bets against the dollar in the sol forwards market and damp
appetite for short-maturity sol bonds, according to Alejandro Cuadrado, the head of Latin America currency strategy at  Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. (BBVA)   The measure “is directed at maintaining the dollar squeeze
in the market,” Cuadrado said by phone from  New York . “We’re
already seeing some investors growing tired of this, and the
continued pounding that we see is going to bring some additional
effectiveness to this measure.”  Four increases in dollar reserve requirements this year
have led the sol to depreciate the most since the fourth quarter
of 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sunk
demand for emerging-market assets. The currency appreciated 5.7
percent in 2012.  The yield on Peru’s sol bond due in May 2015 rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.60 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield has climbed
0.09 percentage point this month and is down 1.14 percentage
points this quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
