Alsea SAB (ALSEA*) , an operator of Burger
King and Starbucks restaurants in Mexico, rose to a record on
speculation the company is benefitting from an increase in
consumer spending.  The stock surged 3.8 percent to 35.29 pesos at 10:21 a.m.
in Mexico City trading, bringing its increase over the past four
days to 10 percent. Alsea shares have advanced 37 percent this
quarter, the second most on the benchmark IPC stock gauge after
tortilla maker  Gruma SAB. (GRUMAB)   “The consumption story in Mexico is positive, with greater
middle-class evolution,” Luis Willard, an analyst with
Corporativo GBM SAB in Mexico City, said in a telephone
interview.  Mexico’s consumer confidence index rose to a four-year high
of 100 in January, before slipping to 95.5 last month. The
economy will grow 3.5 percent this year, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, its fourth
consecutive year of expansion of greater than 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
