San Bernardino, the insolvent
 California  city, sued the state’s tax and finance departments
seeking to block them from withholding sales and property tax
revenue owed to the city.  The city was told March 4 that unless $15 million is turned
over to the state by a redevelopment successor agency, sales and
use taxes owed to San Bernardino may be withheld and property
taxes due to the redevelopment agency and the city may be held
back, according to the city’s complaint filed yesterday in  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  in Riverside, California.  The city will be forced to shut operations as early as mid
May and no later than June 1 if the taxes are blocked, according
to the complaint. The successor agency has no cash and is
insolvent to the tune of $15 million, City Attorney James Penman
said in the filing. The city seeks a court order stopping the
state from withholding the funds.  San Bernardino was the third California city to file for
bankruptcy last year. The city of about 209,000 people lies
about 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of  Los Angeles . A fiscal
emergency, brought on by a $46 million budget shortfall, forced
it to stop paying some creditors and seek court protection, the
city said.  A bill upheld last year dissolved local redevelopment
agencies and redirected their funds to the state to fill a
budget gap.  The case is In re San Bernardino, 12-28006, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Central District of California (Riverside).  To contact the reporter on this story:
