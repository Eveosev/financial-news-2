Jubilee Holdings Ltd. (JBIC) ,  Kenya ’s
second-biggest insurer by market value, advanced to the highest
level on record after competitor  CIC Insurance Group (CIC)  Ltd. said
2012 profit doubled.  The stock jumped 5.1 percent to 249 shillings by the 3 p.m.
close in Nairobi, the capital, the highest since at least May
1997, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It gained for an
eighth day, the longest winning streak since December 2007,
while 2.7 times the three-month daily average volume of shares
were traded. CIC Insurance jumped to a one-week high, adding 1.8
percent to 5.55 shillings.  CIC Insurance, the third-largest insurer on the Kenyan
bourse, said today 2012 profit surged to 1.38 billion shillings
($16 million) from 584 million shillings. British American
Investment Co., the biggest insurer, said on March 14 net income
was 2.52 billion shillings last year, compared with a loss of
1.09 billion shillings a year earlier. Britam’s shares added 0.6
percent to 8.45 shillings today.  “Its peers like CIC and Britam have all recorded
exceptional results and investors believe this trend will
continue with Jubilee,” Moses Waireri, head of research at
Nairobi-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone today.  Jubilee was rated buy with a target price of 203.93
shillings in new coverage by Sterling Capital last month. Profit
in 2012 is estimated to have risen to 2.09 billion shillings
from 1.91 billion shillings a year earlier, according to
Sterling Capital. Jubilee has said it will announce results next
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
