The  Philippines  achieved
investment grade for the first time as  Fitch Ratings  raised its
assessment, rewarding President  Benigno Aquino  for leading a
growth resurgence after lagging its regional peers for decades.  The rating on the nation’s long-term foreign currency-
denominated debt was raised one level to BBB- from BB+, Fitch
said in a statement today. The outlook on the rating is stable.  “The Philippines’ sovereign external balance sheet is
considered strong relative to A range peers, let alone BB and
BBB category medians,” Fitch said, citing the net external
creditor position.  An exit from so-called junk status bolsters Aquino’s drive
to transform the nation into one of the region’s fastest-growing
economies 15 years after the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98.
The upgrade may also boost capital inflows and complicate the
job of the central bank as it tries to rein in an appreciating
peso and curb asset bubbles.  “Funds are already pouring into the Philippines and an
investment grade is a further endorsement,” Eugene Leow, a
Singapore-based economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd., said
before the report. “It allows a wider pool of investors to buy
Philippine assets and there might be a slight bump up in
inflows. The central bank has been sounding off on inflows and
they could implement measures to deter speculative inflows.”  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  surged to a record in
March and the peso is trading near a five-year high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
