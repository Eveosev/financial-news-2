Investor AB (INVEB) , the Wallenberg
family’s publicly traded holding company, agreed to buy Swedish
powered-wheelchair manufacturer Permobil for an enterprise value
of 5.1 billion kronor ($783 million) from a  Nordic Capital  fund.  Investor expects to inject about 3.5 billion in equity
financing into the Timraa-based company, it said in a statement.
The remainder will be financed by external debt and equity
participation by the board, management and other individuals,
Stockholm-based Investor said.  Permobil “has a strong product offering, leading market
positions, good profitability and solid cash flow generation,”
Investor Chief Executive Officer Borje Ekholm said in the
statement.  Permobil had sales of about 1.6 billion kronor last year
and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization of about 350 million kronor, on a pro-forma basis,
Investor said. The deal is expected to close in the second
quarter and is subject to approval from competition authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
