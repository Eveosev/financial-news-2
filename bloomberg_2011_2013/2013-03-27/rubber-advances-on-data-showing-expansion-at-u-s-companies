Rubber climbed as data in the U.S.
yesterday showed companies in the world’s largest economy were
expanding capacity, potentially boosting demand for the
commodity used in tires.  The contract for delivery in September, the most-active by
volume, gained as much as 1.3 percent to 283 yen a kilogram
($2,992 a metric ton) before trading at 281.3 yen on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange by 10:41 a.m. local time.  Orders for U.S. durable goods climbed more than forecast in
February as companies focused on expanding capacity to meet
growing demand. Bookings for goods meant to last at least three
years rose 5.7 percent, the most since September, after a 3.8
percent drop the prior month, the Commerce Department said
yesterday in  Washington .  “Investor confidence in the U.S. recovery strengthened,
spurring purchases of the futures,” Takaki Shigemoto, an
analyst at research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo, said by phone.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.2 percent to 22,805  yuan  ($3,669) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board was unchanged at 86.50 baht ($2.95) a
kilogram yesterday, the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand 
said on its website.  China’s natural rubber consumption this year may rise 7
percent to 3.7 million tons, Deng Yali, chairman of China Rubber
Industry Association, said at a conference in Qingdao yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
