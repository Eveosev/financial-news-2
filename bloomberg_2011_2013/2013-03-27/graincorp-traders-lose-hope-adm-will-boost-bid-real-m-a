Traders are losing faith that
 GrainCorp Ltd. (GNC)  can extract a higher takeover bid from Archer-
Daniels-Midland Co. or a competitor as a dip in Australia’s
wheat crop shrinks the exporter’s profits.  The Sydney-based grain handler has rebuffed ADM’s advances,
even after the world’s largest corn processor in December raised
its offer for GrainCorp to A$2.8 billion ($2.9 billion).
GrainCorp shares, which traded above the sweetened offer as
recently as March 1, have since fallen as investors give up hope
of another price boost or a counterbid. The stock closed at
A$11.76 yesterday, the most below ADM’s A$12.20-a-share bid
since it was announced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “You’re better off taking the money in the market and not
having the risk,” Dennis Hulme, an analyst at BBY Ltd. in
Sydney, said in a phone interview. “The longer it goes without
a competing bid, the less likely it is that one will happen.”  The stock decline is giving Decatur, Illinois-based  ADM (ADM) ,
which already owns almost 20 percent of GrainCorp, increased
negotiating power for its current offer, said Elevation LLC.
With GrainCorp’s  profit  projected to slide 23 percent during the
next two years as Australia’s wheat exports decline, ADM may
succeed at the current price, particularly if harvests miss
forecasts and the stock falls further, said Emerald Group
Australia Pty.  GrainCorp shares fell as much as  1.4 percent  in Sydney
trading today, the most in four months. At A$11.68, the shares
ended below ADM’s opening offer for GrainCorp, which was later
raised, for the first time since that bid was disclosed.  Shipping Grain  GrainCorp operates seven of the eight ports from which
grain is shipped in bulk from  Australia ’s east coast. Since
Australia stripped AWB Ltd. of its wheat-export monopoly in
2006, Glencore International Plc, Cargill Inc. and Agrium Inc.
are among foreign commodity traders that have snapped up former
farmer-owned assets in the country.  ADM said Oct. 19 that it boosted its GrainCorp stake to
14.9 percent from 4.9 percent and wanted to buy the rest of the
company. It now owns almost 20 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The initial A$11.75-a-share cash offer valued
GrainCorp at A$2.68 billion excluding debt, already making it
ADM’s biggest-ever takeover if completed, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Stock Drop  After GrainCorp said the proposal “materially
undervalues” the company, ADM raised the bid to A$12.20 a share
on Dec. 3 and said it was dependent on support from GrainCorp’s
board. GrainCorp said the second offer was still too low.  GrainCorp’s shares, which climbed as high as A$12.38 in
December, traded above the higher offer as recently as March 1
as traders who profit from mergers and acquisitions wagered on
competing offers or another boost from ADM. Down 4 percent since
then, the stock closed yesterday at A$11.76, its lowest level
since ADM’s first approach, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Angus Trigg, a spokesman for GrainCorp, declined to comment
on matters relating to ADM’s bid. Jackie Anderson, a spokeswoman
for ADM, declined to comment beyond a Dec. 12 statement that the
company intends to consider all options regarding GrainCorp.  “There’s really nothing to update because there has been
no further conversation with them since their rejection of our
last proposal,” ADM Chief Executive Officer Patricia Woertz
said during the company’s earnings call last month.  ADM Leverage  ADM, with a  stake  large enough to deter rival bidders, is
gaining power over GrainCorp and may be able to bypass its board
of directors, John Maysles, an event-driven senior analyst at
Elevation in Los Angeles, said in a phone interview.  “ADM might be gaining some leverage,” Maysles said. “If
the arbitrage holding gets large, ADM could go directly to
shareholders with the current price or a little higher. They
would want to have a friendly deal, but GrainCorp management
probably still believes it’s worth over A$13.”  Though GrainCorp’s  board  hasn’t specified what price it
would accept, there’s little chance of ADM meeting those
expectations given the poor outlook for Australia’s wheat crops,
according to Peter Rae, a Melbourne-based analyst at Morningstar
Inc.  “ADM probably won’t be prepared to pay the sort of money
GrainCorp is looking for at this stage,” he said by phone.
“The last few years have been really great for GrainCorp in
terms of the crop size. The expectations are that it’s not going
to be there this year or next year -- more like average years.”  Grain Exports  Australia’s wheat harvest plummeted 26 percent to 22.1
million metric tons in the year through this month, from a
record 29.9 million tons a year earlier, according to a March
 report  from the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource
Economics and Sciences. Still, the next year, the crop
production is expected to rebound to about 24.9 million tons.  Australia, last season’s second-biggest wheat shipper, is
forecast to see export volumes of the grain decline for the
2012-2013 season and the following three straight years, the
report showed.  The harvest is set to weigh on GrainCorp earnings. After
reporting a record  profit  of A$205 million for the year ended
Sept. 30, 2012, the grain handler is projected to earn A$174
million this fiscal year, and A$158 million the next year,
according to analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  No Pressure  Given those forecasts, ADM’s bid was “reasonable,” said
Alan Winney, chairman of Emerald Group Australia, the third-
largest storage and handling network in eastern Australia.  “ADM’s waiting GrainCorp out at the moment because the
forecasts going forward aren’t as strong as recent years’
results,” Winney said in an interview. If the crop from wheat
that’s planted next month misses GrainCorp’s expectations, ADM’s
bid “might look like a very good price,” he said.  Farmers in Australia plant their wheat crop in about April
for harvest starting in about November.  Still, GrainCorp last year only generated 56 percent of its
 sales  through crop trading, down from 75 percent in fiscal 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In addition to its infrastructure, which includes  21
million metric tons  of storage capacity at more than 280 inland
grain-handling sites, GrainCorp produces more than 1 million
tons of malt each year.  ADM has a market value of $21.7 billion, which is more than
seven times that of GrainCorp, and isn’t under pressure from
shareholders to close the deal,  Farha Aslam , an analyst at
Stephens Inc., said in a phone interview.  “ADM has many opportunities around the globe,” said
Aslam, who is based in New York. “GrainCorp is an interesting
one, a good one, but not a necessary one.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
