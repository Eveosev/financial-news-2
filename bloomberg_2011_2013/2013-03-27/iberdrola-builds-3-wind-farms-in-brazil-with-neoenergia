Iberdrola SA (IBE) , Spain’s biggest
utility, built three wind farms totaling 80 megawatts of
capacity in Brazil with local partner Neoenergia SA.  Iberdrola installed turbines at the 20-megawatt Mel II
project and the 30-megawatt Caetite II and Caetite III ventures,
it said today in an e-mailed statement, without disclosing
terms. Mel II is now operating, the company said. The farms all
use 2-megawatt G90 turbines from  Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA. (GAM)   The wind projects are part of a 10-farm, 288-megawatt
collaboration with Neoenergia that will provide enough power for
about 450,000 people, according to Iberdrola. The Bilbao-based
utility is expanding abroad after the debt-strapped Spanish
government cut back subsidies for renewable energy.  The 10 wind farms are funded by 300 million euros ($383
million) of loans from the Bank of  Brazil  and the South American
nation’s development bank, the Banco Nacional de Desarollo
Economico & Social, or BNDES.  To contact the reporter on this story:
