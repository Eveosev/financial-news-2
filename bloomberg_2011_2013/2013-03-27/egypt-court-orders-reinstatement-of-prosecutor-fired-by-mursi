An Egyptian appeals court ordered a
Hosni Mubarak-era public prosecutor be restored to his post
after he was fired by President Mohamed Mursi, in the latest
setback for the Islamist leader.  Mursi removed Abdel-Meguid Mahmoud in November as part of
an expansion of his powers that triggered a new wave of protests
and brought the president into conflict with the judiciary. The
court ordered the justice minister to immediately return Mahmoud
to his post, as the opposition has demanded -- a step that would
require the removal of the Mursi appointee who replaced him.  The ruling “is a slap from the Egyptian judiciary to the
president,” Emad Gad, deputy director of Al-Ahram Center for
Political and Strategic Studies and a senior official with a
secular party, said by phone. “The state of law and
institutions is still functioning” despite efforts by Mursi to
undermine it, he said.  Mursi has already retreated from measures he announced to
increase taxes and impose emergency rule in some regions as he
struggles to end unrest that has persisted since Mubarak’s
ouster in 2011.  The president’s plan for April elections has also been
blocked by a court ruling. Mursi said late yesterday that the
parliamentary vote, which he argues is key to stabilizing the
nation, may now be held in October and the new legislature
seated by the end of the year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
