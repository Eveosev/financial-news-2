Aeon Co. (8267) , Japan’s largest general
retailer, agreed to pay as much as 40.3 billion yen ($426
million) to raise its stake in money-losing rival  Daiei (8263)  Inc. as
part of a plan to expand in major urban areas.  Aeon said it will pay 270 yen a share in a tender offer and
 Marubeni Corp. (8002) , Daiei’s  largest  stockholder, agreed to sell 48.4
million shares, according to a statement from Chiba, Japan-based
Aeon yesterday. Marubeni, an energy, commodities and trading
group, invested in Daiei following the retailer’s 2004
government-led bailout.  The operator of shopping malls and grocery stores, which
already owns a 20 percent stake in Daiei, said it plans to boost
its supermarket business in bigger cities as  Japan ’s retail
industry consolidates amid slumping demand. Aeon has announced
three deals valued at more than $391 million this year,
excluding yesterday’s agreement, outpacing the $324 million
total for all of last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Aeon would like to develop its supermarket business in
urban areas,” Okada, the company’s president told reporters
yesterday in  Tokyo .  Aeon rose 6.3 percent, the biggest gain since 2010, to
1,226 yen at the close in Tokyo trading yesterday, the  highest 
since 2008. Daiei dropped 9.8 percent to 286 yen, paring its
gain this year to 44 percent.  The proposed offer is 15 percent below Daiei’s closing
price March 26, the day before Aeon announced the tender offer.
Daiei, once Japan’s largest grocer, hasn’t had a profitable year
since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Marubeni owned a 29 percent stake in Daiei prior to
yesterday’s agreement and will continue to hold about 5 percent
of the retailer, according to Aeon’s statement.  Daiei received a bailout in 2004 from the government-led
Industrial Revitalization Corp. of Japan to recover from a
collapse that followed an expansion spree in the 1970’s and
1980s that included purchases of a shopping mall in  Hawaii  and
the Hawks baseball team in Fukuoka.  To contact the reporter on this story:
