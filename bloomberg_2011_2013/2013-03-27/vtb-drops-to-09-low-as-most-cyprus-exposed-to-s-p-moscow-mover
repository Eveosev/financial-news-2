VTB Group sank to the lowest level
in more than three years as Standard & Poor’s said  Russia ’s
second-largest lender is the most-exposed local bank to the
Cyprus debt crisis.  The shares lost 2.3 percent to 4.79 kopeks by 2:46 p.m. in
Moscow today, the weakest intraday level since September 2009.
The amount of shares traded was about 26 billion, equivalent to
68 percent of the three-month average.  VTB has slumped 13 percent since Cyprus proposed taxing
bank accounts to secure a 10-billion euro ($12.7 billion)
bailout from the euro area. The island nation agreed to shut its
second-largest lender and tax deposits of more than 100,000
euros on March 25. The “largest” share of nonresident deposits
in Cyprus comes from Russia, and VTB’s Cyprus-based subsidiary,
Russian Commercial Bank, holds the biggest portion among Russian
banks,  Standard & Poor’s  said in an e-mailed note dated March
26.  Should Cyprus leave the euro region and devalue its
currency, “the value of VTB Group’s and its management’s equity
investment in Russian Commercial Bank would post a decline and
result in a decrease in the group’s capital base,” S&P analysts
said in the note.  VTB has $13.8 billion of assets in the country, Moody’s
Investors Service said in a March 13 report. VTB Group may lose
“only tens of millions of euros” in Cyprus, and its subsidiary
contributes about 3 percent of the group’s total profit,
according to a March 20  statement  on the lender’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
