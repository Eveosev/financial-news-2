(Corrects location of spokesman in story published
yesterday.)  A  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP) 
train carrying crude oil derailed in west-central Minnesota,
spilling between 20,000 and 30,000 gallons, the Minnesota
Pollution Control Agency said.  The train derailed at 7 a.m., and oil leaked from one of 14
cars carrying crude that went off the tracks, according to  Ed Greenberg , a Minneapolis-based spokesman for  Canadian Pacific .
The train had 94 cars in all, he said.  Dan Olson, a spokesman for the state agency in Detroit
Lakes, Minnesota, said by telephone that the spill came from
three rail cars with a capacity of 26,000 gallons each.  “It’s not flowing anywhere because of the frozen
conditions and it’s not sinking into the ground, so we do not
feel there’s an environmental threat either to surface water or
groundwater,” Olson said.  The crude was being shipped south from western Canada,
according to Greenberg, who said Canadian Pacific can reroute
trains on other lines to prevent a backup from the spill.
There’s no estimate for how long it will take to clean up the
oil and clear the track.  The derailed cars were carrying a mixed load of crude and
other cargo, said  Kevin Smith , an assistant fire chief with the
Parkers Prairie Fire Department.  To contact the reporters on this story:
