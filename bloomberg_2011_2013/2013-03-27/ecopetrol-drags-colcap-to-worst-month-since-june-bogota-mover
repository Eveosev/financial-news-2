Colombia ’s  Colcap (COLCAP)  gauge headed for
its biggest monthly drop since June, led by a slump in state-
controlled  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  after the oil producer reported a third
straight quarterly profit decline.  Ecopetrol, the most heavily weighted stock on the Colcap,
contributed the most to the index’s drop, followed by  Grupo
Argos SA (INVERARG) , whose cement-making unit Cementos Argos SA has
announced plans to sell shares.  “Ecopetrol lost some of its appeal after its last report,
which showed that growth has really slowed,” Juan David Ballen,
an analyst at Alianza brokerage, said in a telephone interview
from Bogota. “There’s this feeling that it isn’t what it used
to be, and we’ve seen some strong selling from investors.”  The Colcap has dropped 4 percent in March, which would be
the biggest monthly slump since June. The  stock index  was down
0.2 percent at 12:03 p.m. in Bogota today, the last trading day
of the month. Ecopetrol slid 0.4 percent, extending its monthly
decline to 3.1 percent. Grupo Argos lost 0.3 percent and was
down 4.5 percent in March.  Bogota-based Ecopetrol reported last month that fourth-
quarter net income fell 18 percent to 3.62 trillion pesos ($1.98
billion) from 4.4 trillion pesos a year earlier.  Fabricato SA was the Colcap’s biggest loser in March,
tumbling 72 percent after a trading suspension was lifted at the
beginning of the month. Shares were unchanged today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
