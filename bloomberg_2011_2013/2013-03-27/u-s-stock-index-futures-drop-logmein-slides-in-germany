U.S. stocks fell, after the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index yesterday rallied toward a record
high, amid concern over  Europe ’s debt crisis and as pending
American home sales slipped in February.  Banks fell as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. lost
at least 0.8 percent.  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF)  tumbled 14
percent after Morgan Stanley downgraded the shares. Apple Inc.
slumped 2 percent after Pacific Crest predicted it would miss
revenue expectations. Humana Inc. and UnitedHealth Group Inc.
rose at least 1.7 percent after the U.S. Medicare program was
granted authority to raise insurers’ payments.  AOL Inc. (AOL)  surged
8.4 percent after Barclays Plc lifted the company’s rating.  The S&P 500 (SPX)  dropped 0.1 percent to 1,562.85 at 4 p.m. in
 New York , paring an earlier decline of as much as 0.8 percent.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 33.49 points, or 0.2
percent, to 14,526.16. About 5.2 billion shares changed hands on
U.S. exchanges, 18 percent below the three-month average.  “When you have typically light days, the market can get
pushed around a little bit more on nothing,”  Frank Ingarra ,
head trader at Greenwich, Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset
Management LLC, said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees
$1.5 billion. “The market’s still poised to go up.”  Bull Market  The S&P 500 rallied yesterday to within two points of its
record of 1,565.15 reached in October 2007, as orders for
durable goods and  home prices  exceeded estimates. The benchmark
gauge has traded above 1,560 on seven days since March 14, only
to fall short of the record each time. The Dow climbed to
another record yesterday, after first surpassing its 2007 all-
time high on March 5.  The  bull market  in equities entered its fifth year this
month as the  S&P 500  more than doubled from its bottom in 2009,
driven by an unprecedented three rounds of  bond purchases  by the
 Federal Reserve . The S&P 500 is up 9.6 percent for the year, and
has gained 3.2 percent in March.  The  Institute of International Finance  said today banks in
Portugal, Spain and  Italy  may come under funding pressure after
a deal earlier this week in Cyprus rescued the island’s
financial system at the expense of bank creditors.  European governments and the  International Monetary Fund 
agreed Monday to lend Cyprus 10 billion euros ($13 billion) as
long as the country liquidated its second-largest bank and
forced losses on bank bondholders and deposits of more than
100,000 euros.  European ‘Mess’  “I don’t think the bottom’s going to drop out, but it’s
not that simple to just say, ‘Cyprus, where is it, who cares?’”
 Robert Doll , chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management
LLC, said in an interview on Bloomberg TV’s “Surveillance”
with  Tom Keene  and Scarlet Fu. He helps oversee $117 billion at
the Chicago-based firm. “It took years for Europe to get into
this mess. It will take years for Europe to get out.”  While the improving economy is driving the bull market in
U.S. equities, Doll said gains may slow after the S&P 500 surged
130 percent since March 2009.  “We’re due for a rest and a rest doesn’t mean a big
decline,” he said.  Fewer Americans signed contracts to purchase previously
owned homes in February, indicating a pause in momentum for an
industry that is helping power the economy. The  index  of pending
home sales fell 0.4 percent to 104.8, the second-highest level
since April 2010, after a revised 3.8 percent increase the prior
month, the National Association of Realtors reported.  VIX, Banks  The  Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) , which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against claims,
rose 3 percent to 13.15 today. The KBW Bank Index dropped 0.6
percent, as 18 of the gauge’s 24 members retreated. JPMorgan
slid 1.8 percent to $47.77 and Citigroup lost 0.8 percent to
$44.46, pacing declines among financial firms.  Cliffs Natural Resources plunged 14 percent, the most in
the S&P 500, to $18.46. Morgan Stanley cut its  recommendation  on
shares of the biggest U.S. iron-ore producer to underweight, the
equivalent of sell, from equal weight. The company’s iron-ore
business will be halved in the coming years because of increased
supply in the Great Lakes area, analysts led by Evan Kurtz wrote
in a note.  Separately, Credit Suisse Group AG cut its 12-month
estimate on the share price to $10 from $20, while maintaining
an underperform rating.  ‘Relatively Soft’  Apple slumped 2 percent to $452.08. Pacific Crest analyst
 Andy Hargreaves  said the company may miss revenue expectations
during the second and third quarters, due to “relatively soft”
sales of large-screen iPads and iPhones. Apple shares have
slumped 15 percent this year, sliding to their lowest price in
more than 13 months on March 4.  Dollar General Corp. (DG)  fell 2.4 percent to $50.95. The
discount retailer said 30 million of its shares will be sold in
an underwritten secondary public offering. The offer is by
certain existing shareholders and no shares are being sold by
the company, Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based  Dollar General  said
in a statement.  Best Buy Co. dropped 2.4 percent to $22.15. S&P Capital IQ
cut its rating on the electronics retailer to sell from hold.  Humana jumped 3 percent to $68.72 and UnitedHealth rose 1.7
percent to $56.62, after congressional researchers said the U.S.
Medicare program has the authority to raise payments to
insurers.  AOL, the Web publisher that owns the Huffington Post and
TechCrunch, climbed 8.4 percent to $39.20. Barclays raised its
rating on the company to overweight from equalweight, saying
 profit  will increase faster than analysts’ estimates on cost-
cutting and modest revenue growth.  Mattress Firm Holding Corp. rallied 12 percent to $34.77.
Raymond James equity analyst Budd Bugatch lifted his rating on
the Houston-based retailer to outperform from market perform.  SAIC Inc. advanced 3.9 percent to $13.32 after the eighth-
largest contractor to the U.S. government said late yesterday it
will pay a special dividend of $1 per share. The company
forecast full-year earnings of $1.16 to $1.33 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
