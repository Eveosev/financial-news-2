The leu gained for a third day as
 Romania ’s entry to two emerging-market benchmark bond indexes
this month continues to bolster foreign investors’ demand for
the nation’s debt and its currency.  The leu rallied this quarter after JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
Barclays Plc announced they will include leu-denominated bonds
in debt indexes from March 1 and March 31, respectively.  “The supporting factor of net new portfolio inflows
following inclusion to bond indices still remains,”  Roderick Ngotho , a London-based currency strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc, said by e-mail today. “It makes sense the leu is
appreciating.”  The currency appreciated less than 0.1 percent to 4.4118
per euro by 2:55 p.m. in Bucharest, extending its advance this
week to 0.4 percent and jump this quarter to 0.8 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The leu strengthened this week after Cyprus’s bailout
improved investor sentiment for the riskier emerging-market
assets, including Romania’s local bonds. European governments
vowed that the swoop on bank accounts to finance Cyprus’s aid
package won’t set a precedent for future rescues.  To contact the reporters on this story:
