Nestle SA (NESN) , the world’s largest food
company, was fined about 20 million euros ($26 million) by
 Germany ’s Federal Cartel Office for illegal exchange of
competitive information.  The amount was reduced because Nestle cooperated, the
cartel office said in an e-mailed statement today. The payment
is not yet final and the company can appeal, which Frankfurt-
based spokesman Hartmut Gahmann said it intends to do.  The competition authority fined Kraft Foods Inc., Unilever
and Dr. August Oetker Nahrungsmittel KG about 38 million euros
in total for a similar issue in 2011.  “Senior sales representatives at the companies regularly
met over several years to discuss the status and the development
of talks between their companies and retailers and also
partially about planned price increases,” Andreas Mundt, head
of the cartel office, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
