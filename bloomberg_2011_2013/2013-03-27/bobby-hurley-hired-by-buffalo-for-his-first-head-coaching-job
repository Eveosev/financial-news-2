Bobby Hurley, college basketball’s
all-time assists leader, was named to his first head coaching
position at the  University at Buffalo .  Hurley succeeds Reggie Witherspoon, who was fired this
month after leading the program for 14 years, Athletic Director
Danny White said yesterday on the school’s athletics page.
Hurley, 41, was previously associate head coach at the
 University of Rhode Island , where his brother Dan Hurley is head
coach.  “Coach Hurley adds an exciting dynamic to our athletic
department,” White said in the release. “I’m confident, after
our discussions, that he is the right leader to take our program
to the next level.”  Hurley was an All-American at  Duke University , handing out
1,076 assists between 1989 and 1993 as the Blue Devils won two
National Collegiate Athletic Association championships.  He was taken by the  Sacramento Kings  with the seventh pick
of the 1993 National Basketball Association draft and played
five seasons, overcoming a near-fatal car accident early in his
career.  Bob Hurley Sr., Bobby and Dan’s father, has won 26 state
championships as the coach at St. Anthony High School in Jersey
City,  New Jersey . He was enshrined into the Basketball Hall of
Fame in 2010.  The Bulls were 14-20 this season under Witherspoon, their
lowest win total since 2007-08. The program has never played in
the NCAA tournament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
