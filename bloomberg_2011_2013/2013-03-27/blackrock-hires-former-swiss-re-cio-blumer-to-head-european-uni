BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
money manager, hired  Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN) ’s former chief investment
officer, David Blumer, as head of  Europe , the Middle East and
 Africa .  Blumer, 44, who stepped down as Swiss Re CIO in October,
will take up the newly created position at BlackRock on April 8,
the New York-based money manager said today in an e-mailed
statement. His appointment is subject to regulatory approval by
the U.K. Financial Services Authority.  “Blumer will be responsible for developing BlackRock’s
strategic plan for EMEA, building strategic client and partner
relationships, and ensuring strong investment performance,
operating and regulatory standards in the region,” the company
said.  Blumer, who worked at Credit Suisse Group AG before joining
Swiss Re, will serve as BlackRock’s executive representative
with the FSA and will join the firm’s global executive committee
as a senior managing director. His appointment comes six months
after former Swiss central bank president Philip Hildebrand
joined BlackRock as London-based vice chairman to oversee the
firm’s relationships with institutional clients outside the U.S.  BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink has made
other changes to the firm’s top ranks in recent months,
announcing in February that the firm’s long-time strategic and
financial adviser Gary Shedlin would become chief financial
officer and Ann Marie Petach would move to a client-oriented job
at the firm’s investment institute. In January, the firm said
Hsueh-Ming Wang, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive,
would join as chairman of BlackRock  China .  Last week, BlackRock said it was planning on exiting the
direct private equity investing business as it focuses on its
fund-of-funds business. The firm last year acquired a fund-of-
funds unit from Swiss Re, helping BlackRock to double assets in
private-equity funds-of-funds to $15 billion.  James Charrington, chairman of EMEA, will assume a new role
focusing on regulation, governance and people, BlackRock said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
