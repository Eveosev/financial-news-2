Banco Itau BBA SA, the wholesale
arm of  Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) , the biggest Latin American bank
by market value, hired Charles F. Stewart from  Morgan Stanley (MS)  as
chief executive officer of its London subsidiary.  Stewart, who was deputy head of European, Middle East and
Africa investment banking for Morgan Stanley, will be based in
London and start his new job on June 24, Itau said today in a
statement. He replaces Almir Vignoto, who will move to New York
to lead Itau BBAâ€™s U.S. activities. Stewart worked at Morgan
Stanley for 19 years, where he had been head of Latin American
investment banking.  Itau BBA, which received a license to operate as a bank in
London last year, has 600 million euros in capital and $6
billion in assets at the subsidiary, CEO Candido Bracher told
reporters in December. The bank is increasing the workforce
there to more than 100.  The lender is among Brazilian firms expanding outside the
country. It hired John Corcoran from UBS AG in 2012 to lead the
international bond-syndication group in New York. The bank has
also grown throughout  Latin America , with hirings announced in
Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Peru and Colombia.  Itau BBA hired Gregory Wagner last year from Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc to create an international prime-services
business for  hedge funds  and other large clients. Wagner is
based in New York as global head of prime services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
