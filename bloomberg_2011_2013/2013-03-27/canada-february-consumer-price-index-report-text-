The following is the text of
 Canada ’s  consumer price index  report for February released
by Statistics Canada.  The Consumer  Price Index  (CPI) rose 1.2% in the 12 months
to February, following a 0.5% advance in January. This 0.7
percentage point increase in the 12-month change was led by
transportation prices, which rose 2.0% on a year-over-year basis
in February, after falling 0.5% in January.  The rise in the transportation index was attributable to
higher prices for gasoline and for the purchase of passenger
vehicles, both of which rose in the 12-months to February after
declining in January.  Gasoline prices advanced 3.9% year over year in February
following a 1.8% decrease in January. On a monthly basis,
gasoline prices rose 8.4% in February, the largest monthly
increase since May 2008.  The purchase of passenger vehicles index rose 2.5% in the
12 months to February, after declining 0.8% in January. The
acceleration in this index was mostly attributable to a notable
monthly increase in February. Fewer manufacturers’ rebates were
available in February compared with January.  12-month change in the major components  Consumer prices rose in seven of the eight major components
in the 12 months to February. The exception was clothing and
footwear.  Food prices increased 1.9% on a year-over-year basis in
February following a 1.1% rise in January. Consumers paid more
for food purchased from stores, particularly meat (+3.1%) and
fresh fruit (+6.7%). In contrast, prices for non-alcoholic
beverages declined 4.2%.  Consumers also paid 2.2% more for food purchased from
restaurants.  Shelter costs rose 0.8% in the 12 months to February, after
increasing 0.6% in January. Rent and homeowners’ replacement
cost advanced on a year-over-year basis, while mortgage interest
cost decreased 4.2%.  Energy prices  Energy prices advanced 2.0% year over year in February,
after falling 1.7% in the previous month. In addition to
gasoline, prices for fuel oil rose 4.1% on a year-over-year
basis in February, following a 0.8% decline in January. Natural
 gas prices  were up 0.6% in the 12-months to February; the first
increase since December 2010.  12-month change in the provinces  In all provinces, consumer prices rose at a faster year-
over-year rate in February compared with January, led primarily
by higher prices for gasoline and for the purchase of passenger
vehicles.  The largest increase in consumer prices was in Newfoundland
and Labrador, while the smallest occurred in Alberta and British
Columbia.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, consumer prices rose 2.3% on
a year-over-year basis in February, following a 0.9% advance in
January. The province posted year-over-year price increases for
electricity, clothing, and passenger vehicle insurance premiums,
while at the national level these indexes declined.  Consumer prices in  Alberta  rose 0.9% in the 12 months to
February following a 0.5% decline in the previous month. Natural
gas prices increased 20.8% year over year in February. In
addition, gasoline prices advanced 3.8% in the 12 months to
February, after declining 7.3% in January, a larger acceleration
than at the national level.  In British Columbia, consumer prices rose 0.9% on a year-
over-year basis in February, after increasing 0.3% in January.
The smaller increase in British Columbia’s CPI relative to
Canada’s was partly a result of homeowners’ replacement cost,
which declined 2.7% in the province.  Seasonally adjusted monthly CPI increases  On a seasonally adjusted

change. The seasonally adjusted index for transportation

quotidien/130125/dq130125b-eng.htm) on January 25, 2013,
 Statistics Canada  has updated ( http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb -
bmdi/document/2301_D7_T9_V4-eng.htm) the weights in the basket
of goods and services used in the calculation of the Consumer
Price Index (CPI). This marks the first time in the Canadian
CPI’s history that weights were updated two years after the
previous update, instead of the four-year interval which was the
past practice. In addition, the implementation of the new basket
weights has been shortened by three months. As a result, the
Canadian CPI has more current and representative weights.  The new weighting pattern

b&amp;adm=8&amp;dis=2) is based on 2011 consumer expenditures
and replaces the 2009 weighting pattern. The CPI’s time base
remains 2002=100.  For more information, refer to Weights for the Consumer
Price Index

methodology for the passenger vehicle parts, maintenance and
repairs index will be implemented with the release of the April
CPI on May 17, 2013. For more information, refer to Revision of
the Passenger Vehicle Parts, Maintenance and Repairs Index
(  http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/document/2301_D54_T9_V1 -

natural gas;  fuel oil  and other fuels; gasoline; and fuel, parts
and supplies for recreational vehicles.  A seasonally adjusted series is one from which seasonal
movements have been eliminated. Users employing CPI data for
indexation purposes are advised to use the unadjusted indexes.

most volatile components (fruit, fruit preparations and nuts;
vegetables and vegetable preparations; mortgage interest cost;
natural gas; fuel oil and other fuels; gasoline; inter-city
transportation; and tobacco products and smokers’ supplies) as
well as the effects of changes in indirect taxes on the
