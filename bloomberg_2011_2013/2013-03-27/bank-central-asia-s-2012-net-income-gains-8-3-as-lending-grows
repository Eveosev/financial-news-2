PT Bank Central Asia (BBCA) ,  Indonesia ’s
biggest financial services company by market value, said profit
rose last year, spurred by lending for mortgages.  Net income  for full-year 2012 increased to 11.7 trillion
rupiah ($1.2 billion) from 10.8 trillion rupiah in 2011,
exceeding the 11.6 trillion rupiah median estimate of 28
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Mortgage loans  climbed 49 percent from a year earlier, Vice
President Director Eugene Galbraith said during a press briefing
to announce the results.  A robust economy and low  interest rates  are helping to
boost lending, even as the central bank imposed minimum down
payments for home and vehicle loans June 15. The central bank in
March held its  reference rate  at a record low 5.75 percent for a
13th consecutive meeting, spurring domestic consumption in
Southeast Asia’s biggest economy.  Lending increased 27 percent to 256.78 trillion rupiah
mainly supported by consumer, commercial and small- and medium
enterprise loans, President Director Jahja Setiaatmadja said at
the briefing.  “Lending won’t be as strong as previous years, as we see
problems with the exchange rate and trade balance,”
Setiaatmadja said. Lending may increase about 18 percent to 20
percent in 2013, he added.  The Jakarta-based lender’s net interest income, or interest
earned on loans after deducting interest paid for deposits, rose
17.6 percent to 21.2 trillion rupiah, it said in a statement
distributed at the briefing.  “There’s a chance lending rates may increase starting
from the third quarter due to liquidity tightening because of
increasing minimum wages that will spur purchasing power,
increasing inflation pressure and a weakening exchange rate,”
Setiaatmadja said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
