U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will say today that the government will look at offering
tax breaks for employee-owned firms, which he’ll argue offer a
superior model of growth to other companies.  In his March 20 budget, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced a capital-gains tax exemption for owners
selling a controlling stake in their company to their employees.
In a speech in London, Clegg will propose tax relief on bonuses
paid through “benefit trusts,” which are set up to own a stake
in a company and pass on rewards to staff.  “What we want to encourage is for more owners to sell the
business on to those people who know the business inside out,
who will go the extra mile, the wider family who have worked to
build it up and contribute to its success -- in other words, the
employees,” Clegg will say, according to his office.  Clegg, who heads Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron’s Liberal Democrat coalition partners, will make his
speech to the Employee Ownership Association. The EOA has been a
critic of plans by Osborne, a Conservative, to allow people to
give up employment rights in exchange for shares in a company.
Those plans suffered a setback last week when they were voted
down in the upper House of Lords.  To contact the reporter on this story:
