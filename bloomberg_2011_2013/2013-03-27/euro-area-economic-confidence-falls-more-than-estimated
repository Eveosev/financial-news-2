Economic confidence  in the euro
area decreased more than economists forecast in March, adding to
signs that the 17-nation currency bloc’s recession continued
into the first quarter.  An index of executive and consumer sentiment decreased to
90 from 91.1 in February, the European Commission in Brussels
said today. Economists had forecast a drop to 90.5, according to
the median of 30 estimates in a  Bloomberg News survey.   The euro-zone economy has  contracted  for five consecutive
quarters. That trend is forecast to continue in the first three
months of this year before a return to growth in the second
quarter, a separate Bloomberg survey shows. The  European Central
Bank  sees the economy shrinking 0.5 percent in 2013.  “We expect euro-zone economic activity to stagnate in the
first and second quarters of 2013 before returning to modestly
positive growth in the second half of 2013, and more visibly in
2014,” economists at UBS AG including Reinhard Cluse wrote in a
note before today’s data were released. “Domestic demand is
likely to remain a drag on growth in 2013, with positive
impulses only from net exports.”  The euro was trading at $1.2832 at 9:55 a.m. in Brussels,
down 0.2 percent on the day. The Stoxx Europe 50 index was down
0.2 percent to 2634.91.  A gauge of sentiment among European manufacturers declined
to minus 12.5 from minus 11.3 in February, today’s report
showed. An indicator of services confidence fell to minus 6.7
from minus 5.3, while consumer sentiment improved to minus 23.5
from minus 23.6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
