Lietuvos Dujos AB (LDJ1L) , the Lithuanian
gas utility controlled by OAO Gazprom and EON SE, climbed to the
highest level in almost two years after proposing a record
dividend.  The shares rose as much as 7.1 percent and traded up 5.4
percent at 0.738 euro at 10:31 a.m. in Vilnius, rising to the
highest since May 2011 and valuing the company at 346 million
euros ($106 million). Volume of 127,788 shares was six times the
three-month daily average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Management proposed to pay out 62.8 million euros, or 0.134
euro a share, the company said in a regulatory  statement 
yesterday. Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the proposal on
April 25. Last year it paid a dividend of 0.044 euro a share.
Its profit was 22 million euros in 2012.  Lietuvos Dujos shares have surged 26 percent since March 7,
when the company said it plans to transfer its transmission
business to AB Amber Grid, a new company that will apply for
permission to trade its shares on the stock exchange in Vilnius.  Lithuania is splitting ownership of gas sales and
transmission activities as part of a European Union drive to
force dominant energy companies to improve access for
competitors.  Russia’s Gazprom owns 39 percent of Lietuvos Dujos, while
EON of  Germany  owns 37 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Lithuania’s Energy Ministry owns 18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
