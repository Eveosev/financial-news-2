Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
which is still selling assets after exiting bankruptcy last
year, said it will pay $14.2 billion to creditors and affiliates
on April 4.  Depending on available funds, the following payout will
take place around Sept. 30, the defunct investment bank said in
a statement today.  Lehman, which filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history
in 2008, has so far paid creditors about 9 cents on the dollar,
or half of what it expects to pay by about 2016. Its first
payment was $22.5 billion and its second distribution was about
$10.5 billion.  The third payment set for next month will be swelled by
$2.7 billion in cash received Feb. 27 from the sale of apartment
owner Archstone to Equity Residential, according to court
documents. Lehman sold Archstone, its biggest real estate asset,
for cash and stock.  As of Feb. 28, Lehman had free cash of $9.8 billion,
according to a  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  filing in  Manhattan 
yesterday. The defunct firm paid advisers $14.7 million in
February.  Lehman, which is running the most expensive bankruptcy in
history, has paid managers and advisers more than $2 billion
since September 2008. Creditors include  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) ,  UBS AG (UBSN) , the  New York  Giants professional football team and
Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
