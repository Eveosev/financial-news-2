Chinese stocks  in New York rose a
second day, led by web retailers and property companies, on
prospects the recovery in the world’s second-largest economy
will boost company earnings.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. added 0.2 percent to a two-week
high of 92.88. Online bookseller  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG) 
jumped the most in three weeks and fashion discounter  Vipshop
Holdings Ltd. (VIPS)  climbed to a record high.  E-House China Holdings
Ltd. (EJ)  posted the steepest rally in more than two weeks, while
 SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN)  rose to the highest level since Feb. 15.  China’s economy, which emerged from a seven-quarter
slowdown at the end of 2012, will continue to rebound, fueling
company profits, Citigroup Inc. said in a March 25 report. The
New York-based bank maintained its forecast for earnings growth
of as much as 15 percent for MSCI China Index stocks. China will
work to open its economy, President  Xi Jinping  said yesterday at
a meeting of the so-called BRICS nations in South Africa.  “As we get better sequential economic data out of China,
the trend will continue upward showing improvement,” Joel Wells, a portfolio manager at Alpine Woods Capital Investors
LLC, which has $6 billion of assets under management, said in an
interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York yesterday.
“That will then flow through slowly to local Chinese equities.
As China’s capital account opens up, we’ll probably see more
faith in its equity markets.”  Real Estate  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., rose 0.1 percent to $37.35,
while the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  closed little changed at
1,562.85.  Dangdang, the biggest retailer of books online in China,
surged 4.9 percent to $4.10 in New York, the steepest rally
since March 5. Vipshop, based in Guangzhou, climbed 4.3 percent
to $31.12, the highest level since its first day of trading in
the U.S. March 23.  Real estate, information technology and consumer
discretionary companies may have “strong” earnings momentum,
Citigroup analysts led by Minggao Shen wrote in this week’s
note.  E-House, a Beijing-based property agent, advanced 3 percent
to $4.82 in U.S. trading, rising the most since March 11.
SouFun, owner of China’s biggest real estate information
website, gained 1.2 percent to $27.02.  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , which runs China’s most-used search engine,
climbed 2.4 percent to $88.13, the biggest one-day gain in two
months.  Spreadtrum Communications Inc. (SPRD) , a mobile-chip maker
based in Shanghai, rallied 3 percent to $20.23, the highest
level since Nov. 8.  Chalco Slumps  Aluminum Corp of China Ltd. (2600) , the country’s biggest producer
of the light metal, declined 2.7 percent to $9.82 in New York,
the lowest close since Sept. 10. The company’s American
depositary receipts, each representing 25 underlying shares in
the Beijing-based company, traded 2.6 percent below its  Hong
Kong  stock, the widest discount in a month.  Chalco incurred a net loss of 4.98 billion yuan ($801
million) in the six months through December, according to
results derived from its full-year earnings released yesterday.
The loss widened from 174.6 million yuan a year earlier because
of falling prices and higher alumina costs. The full-year loss
of 8.23 billion yuan in 2012 was more than the 5.4 billion yuan
median of 17 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Guangshen Railway Co., which runs the only train line
linking mainland China to Hong Kong, slumped 1.5 percent in New
York to $24.94, the lowest close since March 12. Net income fell
27 percent in 2012 from the previous year to 1.3 billion  yuan ,
according to an annual report that Shenzhen, China-based
Guangshen filed yesterday to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  climbed 1
percent to 11,033.61 yesterday, the highest close since March
14. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic Chinese shares
added 0.2 percent to 2,301.26, after falling over the previous
two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
