Chile’s peso weakened as demand for
emerging-market assets waned as the Cyprus bailout raised
concern investors and depositors could be asked to share in
other bank losses in the euro region.  The peso declined 0.1 percent to 472.53 per  U.S. dollar  as
of 10:14 a.m. in Santiago. The currency has appreciated 0.1
percent this month.  The euro tumbled to a four-month low after the imposition
of  capital controls  to prevent a run on Cypriot banks. Clashes
over aid to Cyprus, which makes up barely 0.2 percent of the
euro-zone economy, underscored the growing unwillingness of
northern European governments to spend taxpayer money to shore
up what they see as mismanaged economies and banking systems in
the south.  “The dollar has appreciated a bit because of external
risk-aversion,” said Matias  Madrid , the chief economist at
Banco Penta in Santiago.  Volatility in the Chilean peso is at the lowest level in 15
years as it trades in a narrowing range. Concern that the
central bank will intervene to weaken the currency has prevented
it appreciating while faster-than-forecast economic growth and
stable  interest rates  ward off declines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
