Mexico ’s peso rose as Cyprus
unveiled  capital controls  to prevent outflows when banks reopen
tomorrow, tempering speculation the island nation’s crisis will
weigh on global economic growth  The peso climbed 0.1 percent to 12.3360 per  U.S. dollar  at
3 p.m. in Mexico City, bringing its rally this month to 3.6
percent, the biggest among 16 major dollar counterparts tracked
by Bloomberg. The currency has advanced 4.2 percent this year,
and it rose 8.4 percent in 2012. Mexico’s stock market will be
closed March 28-29 for Easter holidays, although the peso will
still be traded.  Cyprus announced capital controls to prevent outflows when
banks reopen tomorrow after shutting for almost two weeks as the
island faced financial collapse. The controls include a 300-euro
($383) daily limit on withdrawals, according to a decree from
the Central Bank of Cyprus.  “News came out that they were going to implement capital
controls” in Cyprus, helping the peso climb,  Rafael Camarena ,
an economist at Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico SAB, said in a
telephone interview. “Possibly with these new regulations
they’ll be able to avoid a panic.”  Earlier today, the peso weakened as much as 0.6 percent as
some investors sought refuge in the dollar before the extended
weekend, according to Camarena.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 5 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.19 centavo to 144.28 centavos per
peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
