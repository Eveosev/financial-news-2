The Grand Parkway Transportation
Corp., created to finance a new highway around Houston, plans to
sell $3 billion of toll-revenue debt as soon as mid-April,
according to a pricing announcement.  The offering would be the biggest sale this year in the
$3.7 trillion municipal-bond market, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Goldman Sachs & Co. will underwrite the deal.  Bond proceeds will finance certain segments of the Grand
Parkway project to build a 180-mile (290-kilometer) outer-loop
road around the Houston metropolitan area. Houston is the
fourth-largest U.S. city by population, with about 2.1 million
residents.  “It’s a large undertaking,” said Raquelle Lewis, a
spokeswoman for the Texas Transportation Department. “It is a
huge commitment from the standpoint of the agency to try to
bring as much of that third loop around the Houston area to
fruition as soon as possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
