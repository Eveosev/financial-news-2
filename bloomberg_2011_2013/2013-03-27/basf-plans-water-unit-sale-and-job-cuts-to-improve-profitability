BASF SE (BAS) , the world’s biggest
chemicals maker, will sell a France-based industrial water
management unit and cut some 215 jobs to boost profitability.  A larger water solutions division will be combined with the
oilfield and mining solutions businesses, the Ludwigshafen,
Germany-based company said in an e-mailed statement.  “The planned comprehensive measures are needed to achieve
cost competitiveness,” Hans Reiners, the head of BASF’s
performance chemicals operations, said in the statement. The
sale would be to a ’’strategic’’ partner. “These efforts will
be backed by considerable investments in new technologies in
Europe as well as in  North America  and in R&D.”  BASF cut costs by 100 million euros ($128 million) last
year and intends to generate further savings in excess of that
sum in 2013, Chief Executive Officer Kurt Bock said Feb. 26.
He’s fighting to maintain margins which slipped to 11.2 percent
last year from 11.5 percent amid deteriorating demand for
cosmetic ingredients and paper chemicals. BASF has already cut
400 jobs at construction chemicals and reduced capacity at paper
ingredients in Europe.  Most of the job reductions announced today will come at the
company’s Bradford and Grimsby sites in  England , the company
said. The 61 employee-strong water management business which is
up for sale is based in Lyon, France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
