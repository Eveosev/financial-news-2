EON SE (EOAN) , Germany’s largest utility,
sold a stake in a 200-megawatt wind farm in Indiana to an
investor group that includes  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Wells
Fargo & Co. (WFC)  for $174.9 million.  The Wildcat I project is EON’s first wind farm in Indiana
and was completed in December, EON’s Chicago-based North America
unit said today in a statement. The tax-equity financing give
investors a share of the project’s tax incentives, EON spokesman
Matt Tulis said today by telephone. He didn’t say how large a
stake they purchased.  Wildcat uses 125 1.6-megawatt General Electric Co. turbines
and sells the output to Indiana Michigan Power Co. under a 20-
year agreement, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
