The South African energy
regulator’s decision to set a maximum gas price for consumers
will undermine competitiveness in the continent’s largest
economy, a manufacturing group said.  The National Energy Regulator approved a gas-pricing
structure for  Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , South Africa’s biggest supplier of the
fuel, that starts in March 2014, Pretoria-based Nersa said in a
statement yesterday.  The regulator set a maximum gas price of 117.69 rand ($13)
a gigajoule and laid out discounts from that level for certain
users. The largest will be 37.5 percent for customers buying
more than 4 million gigajoules of gas a year, while the smallest
is 7.5 percent for buyers of less than 400 gigajoules.  “The maximum molecule price is more than double that of
Sasol’s current average pricing,” Coenraad Bezuidenhout,
executive director of the Manufacturing Circle, which represents
40 large companies that employ 200,000 people, said in an e-
mailed statement. While Sasol, which is also the world’s largest
maker of fuel from coal, currently charges an average 64 rand
per gigajoule to external customers, it will be entitled to
charge 105 rand to 140 rand, he said.  The new pricing regime will result in standardized prices
for consumers who buy similar quantities of gas, Jacqui O’Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Sasol, said in e-mailed comments.  “As Sasol has stated previously, the new prices we will
charge will be below the Nersa-set overall and class-maximum
prices,” she said.  Sasol Gas operates a supply network through 2,500
kilometers (1,550 miles) of pipelines in  South Africa  and
 Mozambique , delivering more than 150 million gigajoules of the
fuel to 550 industrial and commercial customers annually,
according to its  website .  One gigajoule is equal to 0.27 megawatt-hours, enough to
power 135 to 270 U.S. homes.  Sasol’s  shares  closed 1.4 percent lower, the biggest
decline in a month, at 410.11 rand in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
