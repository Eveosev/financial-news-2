Georg W. Claussen, who was the
longest-serving chief executive officer at Nivea skin-cream
producer  Beiersdorf AG (BEI) , has died. He was 100.  Claussen, died on March 21 in his hometown of Hamburg
surrounded by his family, Beiersdorf said on its website today.
He was the grand nephew of Oscar Troplowitz, who invented Nivea
in 1911, it said. Claussen joined Beiersdorf’s management board
in 1954 and was CEO from 1957 until 1979.  Nivea, which Troplowitz developed from the discovery of
water-and-oil emulsifier Eucerit, is Hamburg-based Beiersdorf’s
biggest source of revenue. CEO Stefan Heidenreich, who joined
the company at the beginning of 2012, has pledged to return the
Nivea brand to its roots, creating a new logo and packaging
inspired by the product’s traditional box.  “We have lost a towering businessman and luminary,”
Heidenreich said in today’s statement. Claussen “has left a
lasting mark on Beiersdorf, and what he achieved laid the
foundation for today’s success.”  Claussen was born on June 5, 1912, and joined the company
in 1938 after working in the  chemical industry  in  Switzerland 
and the U.K. He repurchased the rights to Nivea brands that had
been confiscated in several countries after World War II,
Beiersdorf said.  The father of four shifted in 1979 to the supervisory
board, where he was chairman until 1987. He became honorary
chairman in 1989. His various roles at Beiersdorf placed him on
the podium for 58 successive annual shareholders meetings, the
company said.  Maxingvest, the investment vehicle of some members of the
billionaire Herz family in  Germany , has had a stake in
Beiersdorf since 1974 and became  majority owner  in 2003 after
buying stock from Allianz AG. Beiersdorf is also the maker of
Tesa adhesives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
