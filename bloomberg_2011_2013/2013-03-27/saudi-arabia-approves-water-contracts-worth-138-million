Saudi Arabia  has approved $138
million of water and sanitation projects across the kingdom,
state-owned  Saudi Press Agency  reported, citing Minister of
Water and Electricity Abdullah Al-Hussayen.  The 29 projects include the construction of reservoirs,
sewage networks, water treatment plants and pumping stations
across the Arab worldâ€™s largest economy, including in Asir, al-
Qassim and Hail, SPA said. Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil
producer, is also the largest producer of desalinated water.  Saudi Arabia spent $1.1 billion last year on 128 water and
sanitation contracts just in the capital Riyadh. In January, Al-
Hussayen said $6.4 billion had been allocated for water and
sanitation projects in 2013. The ministry has listed 160 water
