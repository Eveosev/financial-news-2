A blast of cooler-than-normal
weather across the Great Lakes to the East Coast and down the
Mississippi River Valley may be enough to boost energy demand as
April begins.  Temperatures from North Dakota into the Ohio Valley are
expected to be about 8 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 Celsius) lower
than normal from April 1 to April 5, Matt Rogers, president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC, said in a note to clients today.
Readings may be 3 to 5 degrees lower across a large part of the
East in the same period.  “Normal temperatures are still rising at a steady clip, so
at an absolute basis, the cooling would not be as strong as mid-
to-late March levels, but it would keep late-season demand
riding stronger than normal,” said Rogers, who’s based in
Bethesda,  Maryland .  The U.S. heating season ends with March. April is the start
of a transition to warmer temperatures and when more energy is
used to cool, rather than heat, homes. Extended cold in the
large population centers of the Midwest and East helps boost
prices for heating fuels. About 50 percent of U.S. households
use gas for warmth.  The normal average temperature on April 1 in  New York  City
is 47 degrees, according to  MDA Weather Services  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Boston, it’s 43; in  Chicago , 44; in
Houston, 67; in St. Louis, 52; and in Burbank,  California , it’s
60.  To contact the reporter on this story:
