Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI) , Australia’s
largest builder, will sell 70 percent of its telecommunications
assets to  Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan  for about A$620 million
($647 million).  The sale values the whole business at A$885 million, before
adjustments including ones related to its debt, tax liabilities
and  capital spending , the Sydney-based company said in a
regulatory statement today. Leighton will retain 30 percent of
the business and have 50 percent of board seats after the deal
is completed around mid-year, the company said.  Leighton is selling the NextGen data network, cloud storage
unit Infoplex, and data center provider Metronode to pay debt
following “unsolicited” interest in the business, it said in
September. Leighton paid off about 48 percent of its net debt in
the six months ended December, leaving it with A$914 million,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We have formed a very positive relationship during the
sale process,” Hamish Tyrwhitt, chief executive officer, said
in a statement. “That augurs well for the future development of
these telecommunications businesses.”  Leighton’s chairman and two more of its ten non-executive
directors resigned March 22, saying controlling shareholder
 Hochtief AG (HOT)  didn’t support an independent board.  Investors will be concerned that Leighton is vulnerable to
“capital stripping” by Hochtief, which is itself controlled by
Spain’s  ACS Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA , National
