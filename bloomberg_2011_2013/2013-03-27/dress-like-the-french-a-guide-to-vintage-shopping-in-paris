Paris, a city known for its sizable population of  bobo (bourgeois-bohème)  fashionistas, abounds with vintage boutiques—and I always try to find that one special item to bring home from my time in the City of Light. Here are some of my favorite shops: Free'P'Star and Kilo Shop A play on the word  fripe,  which is French for an article of used clothing,  Free'P'Star  has expanded from its tiny Marais storefront to two additional locations, each packed with racks of trendy  fripes,  from cut-off  Levis  to oversized army jackets. I once found a cute 70s frock for only ten euros. Similarly, the newer  Kilo Shop , just down the street from Free'P'Star, sells its wares, naturally, by the kilo. You'll get a much cleaner shopping experience here, with merchandise organized by type. In the market for a mink coat? You'll find that at Kilo Shop, too.  Free'P'Star: 20, Rue de Rivoli 75004; Kilo Shop: 69-71, Rue de la Verrerie 75004 Guerrisol For those who truly enjoy the thrill of the find, look no further than  Guerrisol . With four locations in Paris (and more than 20 in Tunisia), these enormous bargain depots, revered by genuine  bobos  and Tunisian grandmothers alike, carry an abundance of treasures. But you'll have to patiently dig through aisles and bins of clothing. My favorite of the locations is 17, Boulevard Rouchechouard in the colorful Barbès neighborhood.  17, Boulevard Rochechouard 75009 Espace Kiliwatch An enormous storefront steps from the hip pedestrian Rue Montorgeuil in central Paris,  Espace Kiliwatch  has long been a mainstay for vintage fashion devotees. I'm always drawn to the particularly impressive selection of ladies' boots, as well as the large section featuring up-and-coming designers (for when the immense cache of retro clothing becomes overwhelming). There's a huge selection of men's clothing, too, plus a bookstore with the latest in art and design anthologies. Try not to be intimidated by the impossibly cool Kiliwatch employees.  64, Rue Tiquetonne 75002 Odetta I'd be remiss not to mention  Odetta . Those seeking classic accessories will do well to visit this chic boutique offering designer vintage clothing, jewelry, shoes—even furniture. Considering the quality of its carefully selected inventory, Odetta's prices are surprisingly reasonable.  76, Rue des Tournelles 75003 More from  Condé Nast Traveler : The Top Spas in the World The Most Beautiful Places in Asia 41 Dream Villas Around the World Gorgeous Hidden Beaches The Best Golf Resorts
