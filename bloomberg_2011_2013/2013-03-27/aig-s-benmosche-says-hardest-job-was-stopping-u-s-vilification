Robert Benmosche , the  American
International Group Inc. (AIG)  chief executive officer who repaid a
U.S. bailout, told CNBC that his toughest duty when he took over
in 2009 was countering government criticism of the insurer.  “When you have crisis, it doesn’t help to panic
everybody,” he said in an interview today on the business-news
station. “And that’s what you had, our government trying to
panic people and attacking people and vilifying people. And that
was my hardest job, was to get them to stop so that the people
could come to work and pay back the country.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
