In the battle between  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
and  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  in the global smartphone market, a
winner has been determined. Apple has prevailed.  At least that’s the conclusion based on an unscientific
tally of mentions on Twitter Inc.’s social network, published in
a report yesterday by  Gene Munster , an analyst at Piper Jaffray
Cos. Investing Analytics, the group that compiled the data cited
by Munster, said the iPhone 5 was mentioned 2.4 million times
during its product debut in September, five times more than when
Samsung’s Galaxy S4 was unveiled this month.  Munster said the data indicate that there is more mass
appeal for the iPhone than the Galaxy, and that Apple will
maintain its market share. The iPhone 5 was the best-selling
smartphone in the latest quarter,  according  to researcher
 Strategy Analytics . The Twitter study underscores how investors
are increasingly turning to social media to inform their
investment decisions.  “While interest in the Galaxy S4 is growing, Apple
continues to hold a meaningful lead as the smartphone with the
broadest consumer appeal,” said Munster, who has an overweight
rating, the equivalent of a buy, for Apple with a $767 price
target.  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, declined 2 percent
to $452.08 at yesterday’s close in New York, leaving them down
15 percent so far this year, compared with a gain of 9.6 percent
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
