The Bovespa index fell from a one-
week high as homebuilders declined after  PDG Realty SA
Empreendimentos & Participacoes (PDGR3)  posted an unexpected fourth-
quarter loss.  OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) , the oil company
controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , dropped after saying it
will cut the volume estimates for its only producing field after
missing output targets. Education company Estacio Participacoes
SA gained after it reported fourth-quarter revenue that exceeded
analysts’ estimates.  The Bovespa declined 0.9 percent to 55,167.76 at 10:36 a.m.
in Sao Paulo. Fifty-seven sank on the gauge while 11 advanced.
The real weakened 0.3 percent to 2.0233 per dollar.  “Homebuilders are clearly going through a rough patch,”
Fernando Goes, an analyst at Sao Paulo-based brokerage Clear
Corretora, said in a phone interview. “Investors have waited
for quite some time for them to show some improvement, but so
far it hasn’t happened.”  PDG Realty, Brazil’s largest homebuilder by sales, tumbled
1.3 percent to 3.01 reais. The company posted an adjusted  net
loss  of 1.79 billion reais, according to a statement yesterday.
Analysts had forecast net income of 41.9 million reais, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index
fell 0.5 percent.  OGX, the worst-performing stock this year on the Bovespa
index, dropped 1.3 percent to 2.27 reais after earlier tumbling
as much as 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
