Some pesticides used in agriculture
may damage learning capacity in the brains of honeybees,
according to U.K. research.  Neonicotinoid and coumaphos pesticides in a laboratory were
found to target areas of bees’ brains involved in learning, with
some insects forgetting associations between flower scents and
food rewards, according to a University of Dundee study
published in Nature Communications today. A similar study by
researchers at Newcastle University showed that as many as 30
percent of bees failed to learn or performed poorly on memory
tests after exposure to those pesticides for four days.  “These studies highlight potential dangers to pollinators
of continued exposure to pesticides that target the insect
nervous system and the importance of identifying combinations of
pesticides that could profoundly impact pollinator survival,”
Christopher Connolly, who led the University of Dundee study,
said in a statement distributed by the Biotechnology and
Biological Sciences Research Council.  A European Union committee failed to reach an agreement on
March 15 on a two-year ban previously proposed by regulators
that would have limited some uses of neonicotinoid insecticides
produced by  Bayer AG (BAYN)  and  Syngenta AG (SYNN)  because of risks to honey-
bee health.  To contact the reporter on this story:
