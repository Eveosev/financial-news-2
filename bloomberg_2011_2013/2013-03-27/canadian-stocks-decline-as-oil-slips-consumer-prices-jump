Canadian stocks fell, extending a
monthly decline, as banks and energy producers slumped amid
growing concern over  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Financial stocks retreated as Toronto-Dominion Bank and
Royal Bank of Canada fell at least 0.9 percent. AGF Management
Ltd. slipped 5.7 percent after the asset manager received a
notice from the national tax collector. Niko Resources Ltd. rose
10 percent after saying it’s in negotiations to sell C$157
million ($154 million) worth of assets. Alacer Gold Corp. and
Centerra Gold Inc. added more than 3.6 percent as gold prices
increased for the first time in four days.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 6.73 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 12,699.65 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The S&P/TSX
lost as much as 0.7 percent earlier in the day and is down 1
percent in March. Trading volume was 4.3 percent lower than the
30-day average.  “Fears out of Europe are containing enthusiasm, and if
you’re afraid of Europe then gold is the place to be,”  Barry Schwartz ,  fund manager  with Baskin Financial Services who helps
manage about C$500 million, said from Toronto.  The  Institute of International Finance  said banks in
Portugal, Spain and  Italy  may come under funding pressure after
a deal yesterday in Cyprus rescued the island’s financial system
at the expense of bank creditors.  Forced Losses  European governments and the  International Monetary Fund 
agreed earlier this week to lend Cyprus 10 billion euros ($13
billion) as long as the country liquidated its second-largest
bank and forced losses on bank bondholders and deposits of more
than 100,000 euros.  Canadian consumer prices rose 1.2 percent in February, the
fastest monthly pace since 1991, on a spike in gasoline and
clothing prices. The figure remains below the central bank’s 2
percent target.  Financial shares  contributed most to the S&P/TSX decline,
retreating 0.7 percent as a group. Royal Bank of Canada, the
country’s largest lender, slipped 1.3 percent to C$60.71 as the
firm announced plans to issue more U.S. covered bonds. Toronto
Dominion fell 0.9 percent to C$83.95.  AGF Management (AGF/B)  declined 5.7 percent to C$10.84. The asset
manager said the Canadian Revenue Agency contacted the firm
about the transfer pricing and allocation of income between a
Canadian and foreign subsidiary within AGF Management. The CRA
could reassess tax years 2005 through 2007. AGF Management said
it plans to rebut any formal assessment the agency may request.  Oil Rises  Energy producers pared losses as oil rose to a five-week
high after a government report showed that U.S. refineries
boosted operating rates. Crude tumbled as much as 0.8 percent
earlier in the day, on a report that U.S. inventories rose.  Oil producer Suncor Energy Inc. dropped 1.1 percent to
C$30.40. Crude pipeline operator Enbridge Inc. slid 0.6 percent
to C$47.   Niko Resources added 10 percent to C$5.82. The oil and
natural gas explorer with operations in Bangladesh, Pakistan and
 India , is in “advanced negotiations” with two potential buyers
for undisclosed assets, the company said today in a statement.
It plans to complete the agreements by the end of next month.   Raw-materials producers  climbed 1.1 percent as a group, as
gold advanced 0.6 percent to settle at $1,607.20 an ounce. The
metal has risen 1.8 percent in March as Europe’s debt woes
spurred demand for gold as a haven.  Alacer Gold (ASR)  gained 5.6 percent to C$4.16 and Centerra Gold
rose 3.6 percent to C$6.27.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the largest gold
producer in the world, added 2 percent to C$29.90.  To contact the reporter on this story:
