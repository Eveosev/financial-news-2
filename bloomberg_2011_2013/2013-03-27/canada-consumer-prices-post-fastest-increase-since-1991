Canadian consumer prices rose at
the fastest  monthly pace  in more than 20 years in February on
higher prices for gasoline and clothes, as the nation’s
inflation rate rebounded from three-year lows.  Consumer prices rose 1.2 percent in February, the biggest
monthly gain since January 1991 when the country implemented a
new  sales tax , following a 0.1 percent increase the previous
month, Statistics  Canada  said today. From a  year earlier , prices
were also up 1.2 percent, the highest since October, following a
0.5 percent gain in January.  Economists and investors have been pushing back
expectations for higher  interest rates  as stagnant inflation
lessens the Bank of Canada’s impetus to tighten monetary policy.
Inflation has been below the central bank’s 2 percent target for
10 straight months.  “All in all, we still have inflation numbers in Canada
that are well-contained,” said  Camilla Sutton , chief currency
strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto. “The firming is somewhat
positive but it doesn’t throw us into a new area” in terms of
central bank policy.  The Canadian dollar pared losses after the report, trading
at C$1.0173 per  U.S. dollar  in Toronto at 10:10 a.m., a drop of
0.1 percent from late yesterday. The currency had dropped as  as
much as 0.4 percent earlier today.  The inflation figures “were much firmer than anticipated
across the board,” Sutton said.  Appropriate Policy  Governor  Mark Carney  said March 6 the current overnight
 lending rate  will be appropriate “for a period of time”
because of “material excess capacity” in an economy where
fourth-quarter growth slowed to a 0.6 percent annualized pace.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg earlier this month
projected the overnight rate will remain at 1 percent until the
third quarter of 2014.  The annual  core inflation  rate, which excludes eight
volatile items, accelerated to 1.4 percent from 1 percent in
January, the Ottawa-based agency said. On a monthly basis, core
prices rose 0.8 percent, the biggest gain since at least 1984,
when Statistics Canada records begin.  In its last update of economic  projections  in January, the
 Bank of Canada  forecast core inflation would average 1.4 percent
in the first quarter of 2013 before rising to 1.9 percent at the
end of the year.  Economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  predicted total
inflation on a year-over-year basis would accelerate to 0.8
percent and the core rate would be 1 percent, according to
median estimates. The monthly gain was estimated at 0.7 percent
for total inflation, and 0.3 percent for core.  Monthly Inflation  Gasoline prices  jumped 8.4 percent in February, the largest
monthly increase since May 2008, while clothing and footware
prices jumped 4.0 percent. The cost of buying cars jumped 2.1
percent during the month as manufacturers scaled back discounts.  On an annual basis, food prices rose 1.9 percent,
accelerating from a 1.1 percent pace in January.  On a seasonally adjusted basis, consumer prices rose 0.7
percent in February, compared with the 0.5 percent gain forecast
by economists. The core seasonally adjusted rate was 0.4
percent, with economists projecting a 0.1 percent gain.  In a separate report,  Statistics Canada  said average weekly
earnings of Canadian non-farm payroll employees rose 2.7 percent
in January from a year earlier.  On a monthly basis, earnings rose 0.1 percent to C$908.19
($891.50). The average workweek was 33.0 hours in January,
unchanged from December and up from 32.9 hours a year earlier.  Payroll employment was 15.32 million in January, up 0.1
percent from a month earlier and an increase of 1.6 percent from
a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
