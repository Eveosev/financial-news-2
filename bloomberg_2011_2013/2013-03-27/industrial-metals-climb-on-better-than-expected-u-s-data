Base metals advanced after better-
than-forecast U.S. durable goods orders and home-price data
fueled optimism about demand from the second-largest user.  Copper for delivery in three months gained 0.4 percent to
$7,654 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, before trading
at $7,630 by 9:59 a.m. Shanghai time. Zinc added as much as 0.8
percent to $1,919.75 a ton, while lead gained as much as 0.5
percent to $2,141 a ton.  Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years
climbed by the most since September in February, as sales of new
homes capped the best two months since 2008 and residential
real-estate prices rose in January by the most since June 2006.
Construction generates 40 percent of demand for the metal,
according to the Copper Development Association.  “There’s not too much negative news that can weigh down
copper further at the moment,” said Lu Minsu, an analyst at New
Century Futures Co.  Chile’s Codelco, the world’s largest copper producer, has
rescheduled shipments as a strike at Angamos port, the company
said yesterday. The stoppage began on March 16.  Copper for delivery in July fell 0.2 percent to 55,630  yuan 
($8,954) a ton. The May contract on the Comex gained 0.2 percent
to $3.4485 a pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
