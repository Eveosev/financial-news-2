Investors should buy banks and
brokerages because the shares will extend gains as the  U.S.
economy  strengthens, according to  Robert Doll , chief equity
strategist at Nuveen Asset Management LLC.  “I think you have to own some financials,” Doll, who
helps oversee $117 billion at the Chicago-based firm, said in an
interview on Bloomberg TV’s “Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and
Scarlet Fu. “If you expect the economy to continue to improve,
you’ve got to own some of it.”  Financial companies rallied more than any other industry in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index last year, gaining 26 percent,
as the U.S. housing market recovered. Sales of new homes in
February capped the best two months since 2008 and residential
real-estate prices rose in January by the most since June 2006,
according to economic reports released yesterday.  The  S&P 500  climbed yesterday to within two points of its
record of 1,565.15. The benchmark gauge fell 0.3 percent to
1,559.11 at 1:33 p.m. in  New York  today. Financial stocks slid
0.7 percent. The group has gained 10 percent this year,
outperforming the  S&P 500 (SPX) , which is up 9.3 percent.  While the improving economy is driving the  bull market  in
U.S. equities, Doll said gains may slow after the S&P 500 surged
130 percent since March 2009.  “We’re due for a rest and a rest doesn’t mean a big
decline,” he said.  Housing Market  Residential  property values  in 20 cities increased 8.1
percent in January from the same time last year, the biggest 12-
month gain since June 2006, according to data from S&P/Case-
Shiller also issued yesterday. The advance exceeded the 7.9
percent median forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Sales of newly built homes fell 4.6 percent in February to
a 411,000 annualized rate, following a 431,000 pace the prior
month, a report from the Commerce Department showed. It was the
best two-month showing since August and September 2008.  Equity markets will be more volatile after Cyprus’s rescue
fueled concern the  European debt crisis  will intensify, Doll
said. Volatility increased last week as negotiations over a 10
billion-euro ($12.8 billion) bailout for Cyprus revived concern
the European credit crisis will resurface in countries such as
Spain or Italy. The deal also raised concern that  bank deposits 
in other euro-area nations may be subject to levies to pay for
rescues.  “I don’t think the bottom’s going to drop out, but it’s
not that simple, to just say, ‘Cyprus, where is it, who
cares?’” Doll said. “It took years for Europe to get into this
mess. It will take years for Europe to get out.”  The S&P 500 posted its second weekly drop of the year,
while the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the benchmark  stock index ,  jumped  20 percent for the week.  “A band aid covers up your wound, it does not solve it,”
Doll said. “We’re not out of the woods.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
