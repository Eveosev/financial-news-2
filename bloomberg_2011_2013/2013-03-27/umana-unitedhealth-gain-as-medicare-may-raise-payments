Humana Inc. (HUM)  and  UnitedHealth Group
Inc. (UNH)  rose after congressional researchers said the U.S. Medicare
program has the authority to raise payments to insurers.  A proposed 2.2 percent reduction in a rate that determines
payment to private Medicare Advantage plans can be rescinded if
officials assume Congress will block a 25 percent cut in
physicians’ pay scheduled for next year. Medicare administrators
have said they must take the annual cut into account when
deciding Advantage plan rates, though Congress hasn’t followed
through with the proposed doctor pay reductions for a decade.  The nonpartisan  Congressional Research Service  said in a
memorandum yesterday that  Kathleen Sebelius , the U.S. health
secretary who oversees Medicare, has the authority to assume
Congress won’t allow the cut in doctors’ pay. Doing so would
improve the insurers’ payment rate by 4 or 5 percentage points,
according to America’s Health Insurance Plans, a Washington-
based lobbying group for the industry.  Humana gained 2.6 percent to $68.42 at 12:32 p.m.  New York 
time, after earlier rising 4.7 percent for the biggest intraday
gain for the Louisville, Kentucky-based company in more than
seven weeks. UnitedHealth rose 1.6 percent to $56.51 after
earlier advancing 2.5 percent for the Minnetonka, Minnesota-
based company’s biggest gain in more than seven weeks.  Alex Kepnes, a Humana spokesman, and Tyler Mason, a
UnitedHealth spokesman, didn’t immediately respond to messages
asking about the memo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
