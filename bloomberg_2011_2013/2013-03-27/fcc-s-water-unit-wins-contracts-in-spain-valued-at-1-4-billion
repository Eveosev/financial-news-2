Fomento de Construcciones &
Contratas SA said the Spanish builder’s water unit has been
awarded 1.1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) of contracts.  Aqualia won a 900 million-euro contract to manage water
service in the southern Spanish city of Jerez for 25 years, FCC
said today in a statement. The water unit also was awarded
contracts in cities and regions including  Madrid , Avila, Oviedo,
Girona and Cantabria valued at more than 200 million euros, it
said.  The Barcelona-based construction company said this month
that it plans to focus on environmental services, infrastructure
works and water management as part of a three-year plan to
reduce debt and return to profit.  FCC  shares  climbed as much as 2.8 percent and gained 1
percent to 7.64 euros at 3 p.m. in Madrid, the best performing
stock on the benchmark IBEX 35 index. That valued the company at
971 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
