Gold futures rose for the first
time in four sessions on speculation that the  Federal Reserve 
will maintain monetary stimulus amid signs of a limited recovery
in the U.S. housing market.  Fed Bank of  New York  President William C. Dudley yesterday
called for “accommodative” policy to spur the economy. The
index of pending home sales fell 0.4 percent to 104.8 in
February, the National Association of Realtors said today. Gold
headed for the second straight quarterly drop, partly on signals
that the central bank will scale back its stimulus program as
the economy improves.  “Home-sales data has provided support, and Dudley’s
statement has helped,”  Michael Smith , the president of T&K
Futures & Options in  Port St. Lucie ,  Florida , said in a
telephone interview. “Also, the market has been beaten down so
much that there could be some buyers coming in at these lower
prices.”  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for June delivery
gained 0.6 percent to settle at $1,607.20 an ounce at 1:42 p.m.
Trading was 29 percent above the average in the past 100 days
for this time. The metal dropped 1 percent in the previous three
sessions. The price hasn’t slumped for two straight quarters
since 2001.  Gold, up 1.8 percent in March, headed for the first monthly
gain since September after Europe’s debt woes spurred demand for
the metal as a haven.  Silver futures for May delivery fell 0.2 percent to $28.612
an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery jumped 0.9 percent to $1,583.50 an ounce.  Palladium futures for June delivery advanced 0.9 percent to
$768.30 an ounce. Trading was 50 percent less than the 100-day
average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
