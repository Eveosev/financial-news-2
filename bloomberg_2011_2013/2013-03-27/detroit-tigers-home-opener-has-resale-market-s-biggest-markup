Secondary market ticket prices for the Detroit Tigers’ home opener have the biggest percentage markup of any Major League Baseball team, according to rankings compiled by Bloomberg.  With the Tigers having reached the  World Series  last season, the average face-value price for a ticket to their April 5 game against the  New York Yankees  at Comerica Park is $41.44 and the average resale price is $202.84, a 389.5 percent increase, based on data compiled by ticket aggregator  TiqIQ .  “Coming off the World Series, even though it was a loss, and having the team that they have, fans are going to pay a premium, especially for opening day,” Chris Matcovich, a spokesman for TiqIQ, said in a telephone interview.  The Tigers were swept in baseball’s championship in four games by the  San Francisco Giants  in October.  San Francisco ’s $195.35 face-value price and $254.04 secondary market price for their April 1 home opener against the  St. Louis Cardinals  are each tops in the majors.  Several major-league teams, such as the Giants, use a dynamic-pricing model to sell individual-game tickets, applying real-time sales data and other factors to adjust prices by the minute. Others, such as the Tigers, use a tiered model, offering some games at a regular price, some at a discount and others at a premium, depending on expected fan interest.  The Tigers “are losing out this year, because even if it’s a premium game, fans are getting a deal compared to what the secondary market is posting,” Matcovich said.

Actual Demand  Some teams rank lower than others by percentage because they’ve come closer to determining actual ticket demand with their face-value offering.  The average face-value price for a ticket to the  New York  Mets’ April 1 home opener against the  San Diego Padres  was $176.21, according to TiqIQ. Secondary market tickets are similarly priced, averaging $160.91, or an 8.7 percent decline.  “To me, it would say that that system is working,” Matcovich said of prices for the Mets, who are using a dynamic model. “The team is pricing them correctly here.”  Mets spokeswoman Danielle Parillo declined to comment on the team’s ticket pricing in an e-mail.  The resale price for the New York Yankees’ April 1 home opener against the  Boston Red Sox  is $216.88, 83 percent higher than the average face value of $118.38, TiqIQ said.  Average face-value prices were calculated by adding all the price categories on team websites for opening day and dividing by the number of price points. Average resale prices were determined by totaling the value of all tickets available on the resale market on March 26 through TiqIQ and dividing by the number of listings.
