Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) , the
lender that operates in more African countries than any other,
gained the most in more than six weeks after full-year profit
rose 39 percent.  Ecobank’s  shares  traded in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial
capital, advanced 1.8 percent, the most since Feb. 12, to close
at 14.05 naira. The stock has climbed 24 percent this year,
compared with a 19 percent rally for the  Nigerian Stock Exchange
All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   The Lome, Togo-based lender said late yesterday that profit
after tax rose to $286.7 million in 2012 from $206.8 million a
year earlier, boosted by acquisitions. Ecobank acquired  Trust
Bank Ltd. (TRBK) , a closely held Ghanaian lender, last year and merged
it with its local unit to create the biggest lender by assets in
the West African country. It also bought Oceanic Bank
International Plc, a Nigerian lender that had been bailed out by
the central bank, in February last year.  “Ecobank’s operating efficiency continued its improving
trend through the year,” Muyiwa Oni and Rele Adesina, analysts
at Stanbic IBTC Holding Co. in Lagos, which has a  buy
recommendation  on the bank, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients
today. The “stronger than expected” results were boosted by a
$72.6 million payment from the Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria 
related to the acquisition of Oceanic Bank, the analysts wrote.  Amcon was set up in 2010 after a debt crisis threated the
collapse of Nigeria’s banking industry. It said it spent 5.6
trillion naira ($35.4 billion) in 2011 to acquire non-performing
loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
