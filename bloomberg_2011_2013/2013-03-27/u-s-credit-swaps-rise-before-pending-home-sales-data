A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk rose as investors awaited data that may show pending home
sales fell last month and after  Italy ’s Pier Luigi Bersani said
there was no possibility for a broad coalition.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
1.8 basis points to a mid-price of 92.3 basis points at 8:18
a.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure is at the highest intraday level since traders moved to
a new version on March 20.  A report from the National Association of Realtors at 10
a.m. in  Washington  may show  pending sales  of existing houses
declined in February. Contracts to purchase previously owned
U.S. homes fell 0.3 percent after climbing 4.5 percent in
January, economists forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Weakening
economic data may stir investor concern that companies will have
difficulty repaying their debts.  Italy’s Five Star Movement won’t back Democratic Party
leader Bersani in a confidence vote, the party’s chief whips in
parliament said, leaving no possibility of a broad coalition to
resolve a deadlock caused by elections last month.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
