day during the week ending March 22, 2013, 364 thousand barrels
per day above the previous weekâ€™s average. Refineries operated
at 85.7 percent of their operable capacity last week. Gasoline
production increased last week, averaging just under 8.9 million
barrels per day. Distillate fuel production decreased last week,
averaging 4.2 million barrels per day.  U.S. crude oil imports averaged about 8.2 million barrels per
day last week, up by 841 thousand barrels per day from the
previous week. Over the last four weeks, crude oil imports have
averaged 7.6 million barrels per day, about 1.2 million barrels
per day below the same four-week period last year. Total motor
gasoline imports (including both finished gasoline and gasoline
