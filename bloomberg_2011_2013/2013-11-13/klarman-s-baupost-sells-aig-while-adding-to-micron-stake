Baupost Group LLC, the Boston-based
hedge-fund firm run by Seth Klarman, sold its stake in  American
International Group Inc. (AIG)  in the third quarter.  Baupost sold 10.1 million shares of the New York-based
insurer that repaid a bailout from the federal government,
according to a regulatory filing today with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. The shares were valued at $452 million
at the end of the second quarter.  Klarman, whose firm had assets of about $29 billion as of
mid-September, added 22.5 million shares of  Micron Technology
Inc. (MU)  in the quarter, making it his fund’s largest single stock
position. Baupost owns 64 million shares of the Boise, Idaho-based producer of semiconductors. Micron reached a 52-week  high 
today after the shares almost tripled this year.  Baupost sold 13 million shares of London-based oil company
 BP Plc (BP/)  in the third quarter, cutting its holding to 5.6 million
shares, the regulatory filing shows.  Klarman, 56, is a bargain hunter who wrote the preface to
the sixth edition of “Security Analysis,” a 1934 book by
 Benjamin Graham  and David Dodd that is considered the bible of
value investing. He has said he will return some money to
investors at the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
