Uruguay routed Jordan 5-0 and  Mexico 
defeated  New Zealand  5-1 to open their soccer World Cup
qualifying playoffs and close on a berth at next yearâ€™s
tournament in Brazil.  Two-time world champion Uruguay, a semifinalist at the 2010
edition, got goals from Maximiliano Pereira, Cristian Stuani,
Nicolas Lodeiro, Cristian Rodriguez and Edinson Cavani in Ammam
to take control of the two-match intercontinental playoff.  Oribe Peralta scored twice and Paul Aguilar, Raul Jimenez
and  Rafael Marquez  added the others to give Mexico, which
reached the round of 16 at the past five World Cups, the home
win against New Zealand in Mexico City. Chris James got a late
consolation goal for the visiting team.  The return games are scheduled Nov. 20, with the winners of
the home-and-away series advancing to the 32-team World Cup.
Twenty-one nations have already qualified and the remaining 11
spots will be decided by playoffs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
