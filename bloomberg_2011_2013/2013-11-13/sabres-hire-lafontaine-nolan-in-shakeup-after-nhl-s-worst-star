The Buffalo Sabres fired General
Manager Darcy Regier and coach Ron Rolston, replacing them with
National Hockey League Hall of Fame player Pat LaFontaine and
former coach Ted Nolan.  The Sabres have the worst record in the NHL, 4-15-1, with
one victory at home.  LaFontaine, 48, who spent the past two months working in
the NHL’s corporate offices as a director of hockey development,
will be the Sabres’ president of hockey operations and in charge
of finding the team’s new general manager. LaFontaine played
seven seasons for the Sabres as part of a 15-year career that
also included eight years with the  New York  Islanders.  Regier, 56, had been GM for 16 years, the longest such
tenure in the Sabres’ 43-year history.  Nolan, 55, who was named interim coach, served as Buffalo’s
coach from 1995 to 1997. He had been coaching the Latvian men’s
national team.  “It’s great to be back,” Nolan said. “Hopefully I can
bring some credibility back into this organization. There aren’t
enough words in me to explain how excited I am.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
