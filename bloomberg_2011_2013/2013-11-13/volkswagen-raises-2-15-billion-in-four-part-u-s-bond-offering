Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe ’s largest
automaker, raised $2.15 billion in its largest sale of dollar-denominated bonds in a year.  The maker of the Jetta and the Bentley sold fixed- and
floating-rate debt due from 2015 to 2018 in four parts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The offering, the
company’s largest in the U.S. since it raised $2.6 billion a
year ago, is expected to be rated A3 by Moody’s Investors
Service, according to a person with knowledge of the transaction
who asked not to be identified citing lack of authorization to
speak publicly.  Volkswagen issued $500 million each of 1.125 percent,
three-year debt to yield 55 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and 2.125 percent, five-year bonds at a
relative yield of 75 basis points, Bloomberg data show. It also
sold $750 million of three-year, floating-rate securities to
yield 44 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
offered rate and $400 million of two-year, floating-rate notes
at a 33 basis-point spread.  The Wolfsburg, Germany-based company offered the notes
through its Volkswagen International Finance NV unit, Bloomberg
data show. Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley, and Royal Bank of
Canada managed the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
