Middlesbrough hired former Real
 Madrid  assistant Aitor Karanka to replace Tony Mowbray, who was
fired last month as the soccer club struggled in the bottom half
of  England ’s Championship.  The 40-year-old Spaniard was an assistant to Jose Mourinho
at Real, and will be Middlesbrough’s first foreign manager. The
former coach of Spain’s under-16 squad left Madrid when Mourinho
moved to Chelsea and was replaced by Carlo Ancelotti.  Middlesbrough is 16th in the 24-team Championship, five
points above the relegation zone after 15 games.  “He brings with him some fantastic experience as a player
and as a talented young coach,” Chief Executive Officer Neil Bausor said in a statement on the team’s website.  Karanka played 93 times for Real Madrid, including in the
2000 Champions League final victory over  Valencia , Middlebrough
said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
