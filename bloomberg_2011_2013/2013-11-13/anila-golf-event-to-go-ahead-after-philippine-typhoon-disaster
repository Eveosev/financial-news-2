This week’s Manila Masters golf
tournament will take place, even as Philippine President Benigno Aquino declared a state of calamity following Typhoon Haiyan,
the Asian Tour said today.  The decision was made “after careful consideration and
consultation with the local golf associations, authorities and
relief agencies,” the organizers said in an e-mailed statement.  The government said at least 2,275 people were killed and a
further 6.9 million may be affected as a result of the super
typhoon that struck the southern  Philippines  on Nov. 8. Rescue
efforts are under way but are hampered by lack of transport
vehicles and roads which have been washed away or blocked.  The Asian Tour said it will support the Philippine Red
Cross in its bid to “provide aid and assistance to alleviate
the human suffering.” The golf course is south of Manila, more
than 300 miles from the city of Tacloban, one of the areas
hardest hit by the storm.  “We feel for the people affected by this unfortunate
tragedy and hope that through the staging of this tournament and
through our support of aid and relief programs, we will be able
to help in whatever way possible,” Mike Kerr, chief executive
officer of the Asian Tour, said.  The inaugural $750,000 competition is set to start tomorrow
at the  Manila  Southwoods Golf and Country Club.  To contact the reporter on this story:
