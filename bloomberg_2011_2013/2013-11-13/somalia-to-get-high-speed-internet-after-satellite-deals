Somalia will have access to high-speed telecommunications networks after agreeing to two deals
that will connect the Horn of  Africa  nation to fiber optic
cables and satellites.  O3b Networks Ltd., a satellite provider that includes
 Google Inc. (GOOG)  and HSBC Principal Investments among its investors,
will provide Internet capacity to Hargeisa, Somalia-based Somtel
from 2014, the company said in a statement today.  “At present, connectivity is neither reliable nor adequate
in Somalia,” Somtel Chief Technology Officer Ismail Dualeh said
in the statement. “The O3b solution will give Somtel the chance
to bring vastly improved Internet connectivity with better
performance.”  Somalia’s first fiber optic broadband link will be built by
Mauritius-based  Liquid Telecom , the company said in a statement
yesterday. The build out of communication networks in the
country has been hampered by conflict since the 1991 fall from
power of Mohamed Siad Barre’s dictatorship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
