U.K. consumers can expect their
energy bills to rise by 18 percent more than inflation over the
next 17 years, according to government projections included in a
report by the National Audit Office.  Energy costs have become a central political issue since
opposition  Labour Party  leader  Ed Miliband  pledged to make
suppliers freeze prices for 20 months if he wins the 2015
election. The 176 billion-pound ($280 billion) cost of new
infrastructure investment will have to be recouped from
customers, the NAO said. The only available forecast of water
bills, by a supplier, saw a 28 percent real-terms rise by 2030.  The price rises will hit the poorest hardest, the
government spending watchdog said in the report published in
 London  today. Energy accounts for 9.8 percent of the spending of
the 10 percent of households with the lowest incomes, while
water bills make up 5.3 percent. The NAO said the severity of
poverty experienced by those at the bottom would worsen.  “Government and regulators do not know the overall impact
of planned infrastructure on future consumer utility bills, or
whether households, especially those on low incomes, will be
able to afford to pay them,” Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO,
said in an e-mailed statement. “It seems critical to know how
much is too much, based on reliable information.”  Prime Minister  David Cameron  announced an investigation on
Oct. 23 into profit and competition among energy suppliers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
