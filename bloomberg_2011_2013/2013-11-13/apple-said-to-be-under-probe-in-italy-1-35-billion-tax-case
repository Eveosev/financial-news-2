Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the world’s most
valuable technology company, is under investigation in  Italy  for
allegedly evading more than 1 billion euros ($1.35 billion) in
taxes, two people familiar with the case said.  The Cupertino, California-based company, which was fined
about 1 million euros in 2011 and 2012 by Italy’s competition
regulator in a warranty case, may have used foreign companies to
avoid paying taxes in Italy, said one of the people, who asked
not to be named because the probe is continuing.  “Apple pays every dollar and euro it owes in taxes and we
are continuously audited by governments around the world,”
Apple said in an e-mailed statement. “The Italian tax
authorities already audited Apple Italy in 2007, 2008 and 2009
and confirmed that we were in full compliance with the OECD
documentation and transparency requirements. We are confident
the current review will reach the same conclusion.”  Italian weekly magazine L’Espresso reported earlier on its
website that the case involves Apple’s tax payments in Italy
during 2010 and 2011. No one in the Milan Prosecutor’s Office
responded to phone calls after normal office hours.  The shifting of profits by multinational companies is
costing the U.S. and Europe at least $100 billion per year in
lost  tax revenue , according to Kimberly Clausing, an economics
professor at Reed University in  Portland , Oregon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
