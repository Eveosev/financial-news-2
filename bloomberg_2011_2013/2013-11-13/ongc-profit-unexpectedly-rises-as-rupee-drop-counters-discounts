Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) ,  India ’s
biggest explorer, reported a surprise increase in second-quarter
profit after the rupee’s drop to a record boosted earnings and
helped counter higher discounts on crude oil.  Net income  rose 2.7 percent to 60.6 billion rupees ($955
million), or 7.09 rupees a share, in the second quarter ended
Sept. 30 from 58.97 billion rupees, or 6.89 rupees, a year
earlier, according to a regulatory filing today. That beat the
58.3 billion rupee median of 21 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Net sales rose 13 percent to 223 billion rupees.  The higher profit breaks a sequence of four consecutive
quarters of lower income for ONGC and will help its plan to
spend 11 trillion rupees by 2030 to raise production and add
reserves in India and overseas. Discounting on crude oil sales
to state-run refiners is one of the biggest risks for the
explorer as Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government is asking
it to bear a larger portion of the subsidy burden.  The company will benefit from higher gas prices starting
April 1. The government in June allowed producers to set prices
as a weighted average of rates in the U.S., U.K. and import
costs of Japan and India. This will almost double local prices
from the current $4.2 per million British thermal units.  The rupee’s 13.36 percent drop this year is helping ONGC
earn more in the local currency. It sells gas in dollars. The
rupee slumped to a record 68.845 per dollar on Aug. 28.  ONGC has gained 0.3 percent this year, compared with a 4
percent rise in the benchmark  S&P BSE Sensex (SENSEX)  index. The  shares 
rose 1.1 percent to 268.85 rupees in Mumbai. The earnings were
announced after trading closed for the day.  The explorer gave 138 billion rupees of discounts to
refiners including  Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL)  in the quarter, compared
with 123.3 billion rupees a year earlier, according to the
statement. Total cost rose 12 percent to 148 billion rupees.  ONGC is risking incurring a loss at its crude oil business
for the first time as subsidy payments increase and production
expenses rise, Chairman Sudhir Vasudeva said Oct. 31. Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh’s government is asking state-controlled
oil explorers ONGC and  Oil India Ltd. (OINL)  to bear a larger portion
of the revenue losses state-run refiners incur on selling fuels
below the cost of production to help curb inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
