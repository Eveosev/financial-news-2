Ukraine’s parliament failed to vote
on a bill to allow jailed former Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko 
to receive medical treatment abroad as European Union
negotiators prepare to present a report on the country.  Lawmakers didn’t have a reconciled draft to bring to a vote
at an extraordinary session today, parliamentary Speaker
Volodymyr Rybak said in the capital, Kiev. The next session will
be held on Nov. 19, he said. EU negotiators Pat Cox and ex-Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski attended the meeting.  Ukraine wants to sign an association agreement and free-trade pact with the EU this month, which would cement a westward
shift and snub  Russia ’s offer to join its customs union with
Belarus and  Kazakhstan . The accord was delayed in 2011 after
Tymoshenko was convicted in an abuse-of-office trial she and the
28-member EU deem selective justice.  The Swedish and Polish foreign ministers said Oct. 22 that
Ukraine’s deal with the EU depends on the Kwasniewski-Cox
conclusions. EU negotiators demand Tymoshenko be allowed to get
treatment for back pain in  Germany . Ukraine has until Nov. 18 to
meet the bloc’s conditions, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said then.  To contact the reporters on this story:
