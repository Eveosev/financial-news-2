Copper futures tumbled the most in
15 weeks amid speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will scale
back U.S. monetary stimulus this year, while output of the metal
rose to a monthly record in  China .  Fed Bank of Atlanta President  Dennis Lockhart  said
yesterday that talks on a cut in bond purchases by the central
bank “could well take place” next month. China’s output of
refined copper in October climbed 23 percent to 637,000 metric
tons from a year earlier. Futures have slumped 14 percent in
2013, partly on prospects for increased mine production.  “Imminent tapering and Chinese output surges compounded
the weakness,” Michael Turek, a senior director at Newedge
Group SA in New York, said in an e-mail. “The markets seem to
be getting short enough to set themselves up for a decent year-end rally, but for now, if these markets pick up their heads,
they appear likely to get kicked in the teeth.”  Copper futures for December delivery slumped 2.3 percent to
settle at $3.1595 a pound at 1:21 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
the biggest drop for a most-active contract since July 26.
Earlier, the price touched $3.1525, the lowest since Aug. 7.
China is the world’s biggest user, followed by the U.S.  Yesterday, open interest, or the number of futures
contracts yet to be closed, liquidated or delivered, rose to
163,264, the highest since Aug. 14, according to the latest
Comex data.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell 2 percent to $6,980 a ton ($3.17 a pound). Aluminum
and lead dropped, while nickel, tin and zinc advanced.  A  gauge  of the six LME metals fell 1.1 percent to the
lowest since Aug. 7. The measure has declined 12 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
