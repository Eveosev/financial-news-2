TPG Capital appointed Tim Dattels as
co-head of Asian operations, replacing Stephen Peel, who’s
stepping down to focus on  emerging markets  outside the region.  Peel, 48, said by phone today he will remain in Hong Kong,
focusing on TPG’s businesses in  Russia  and Eastern Europe, which
he helped set up. He will stay on the buyout firm’s investment
committee in Asia.  Dattels, who couldn’t be reached on his mobile phone, will
move to Hong Kong around February from the U.S., a TPG spokesman
said, asking not to be identified because he’s not authorized to
discuss personnel matters. Dattels was part of Newbridge Capital
LLC, TPG’s former Asia unit, with Ben Gray, TPG’s other co-head
for the region.  The management changes at the Fort Worth, Texas-based firm
were reported by Reuters earlier today. TPG is currently raising
its sixth fund in Asia after investing a $3.8 billion fund set
up in 2008. Global firms are amassing new funds in Asia as the
latest rounds raised from 2005 to 2008 near the end of their
investment cycles.  Peel said he didn’t want to stay for Fund VI and asked to
step aside from management. He joined TPG in  London  in 1997 from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s private-equity business and started
TPG’s European  business  the same year. He was relocated to
Moscow in late 2006 to open an office there.  He was responsible for Eastern European emerging markets
and  India  before moving to  Hong Kong  in 2008 to become Asia co-head with Dan Carroll. Carroll moved to the U.S. a year later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
