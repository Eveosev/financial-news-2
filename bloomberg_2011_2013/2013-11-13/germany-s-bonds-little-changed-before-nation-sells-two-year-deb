Germany ’s 10-year government bonds
rose, with yields falling from near a three-week high, as data
showed European industrial production slid in September more
than analysts predicted, spurring bets on more stimulus.  Italian  two-year note  yields slid to a six-month low after
European Central Bank executive board member Peter Praet was
quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying officials could
consider asset purchases. Italy’s 10-year bonds rose even after
the nation sold 5.5 billion euros ($7.4 billion) of debt
maturing between 2016 and 2044. Janet Yellen is scheduled for a
confirmation hearing tomorrow to lead the Federal Reserve.  “The euro-area industrial production data was
disappointing, which casts doubt on the strength of the upturn
and that’s giving bunds a little bit of support,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at broker RIA Capital
Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “Essentially we are waiting for
Yellen’s testimony tomorrow. Until then the market will be stuck
in a narrow range.”  Germany’s 10-year bund yield fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 1.74 percent at 4:39 p.m. London time
after climbing to 1.79 percent yesterday, the highest since Oct.
23. The 2 percent bond maturing in August 2023 rose 0.485, or
4.85 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 102.35. The rate on
two-year notes due in September 2015 dropped two basis points to
0.082 percent.  Germany allotted 4 billion euros of zero percent securities
due in December 2015 in an auction today at an average yield of
0.1 percent, compared with 0.19 percent when the nation sold the
September 2015 notes on Oct. 16.  Output Falls  Industrial production  in the 17-nation euro area dropped
0.5 percent in September after rising 1 percent in August, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. The
median estimate of 32 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a 0.3 percent decline.  The ECB cut its main refinancing  rate  to 0.25 percent on
Nov. 7. The annual  inflation rate  in the euro area slowed to 0.7
percent last month, the lowest since November 2009, data showed
on Oct. 31. The inflation target is 2 percent. Inflation erodes
the purchasing power of the fixed payments from bonds.  “If our mandate is at risk we are going to take all the
measures that we think we should take to fulfill that mandate,”
Praet was quoted as saying in the Wall Street Journal article.
“That’s a very clear signal.”  Italy ’s two-year yield fell five basis points to 1.21
percent after reaching 1.19 percent, the lowest since May 3.
Rates on similar-maturity Spanish debt declined for a sixth day,
falling three basis points to 1.37 percent.  Fed Bets  Bund yields dropped six basis points on the day of the ECB
decision, and then jumped the following day as a report showed
the U.S. economy added more jobs last month than forecast,
fueling bets that Fed policy makers will trim $85 billion in
monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage debt. Yellen, who was
named last month to succeed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, will
express her views publicly for the first time in seven months on
the record stimulus she’s supported when she testifies to the
Senate Banking Committee.  “After the recent selloff it would make sense to have a
limited recovery,” said  Patrick Jacq , a senior strategist at
BNP Paribas SA in Paris. “The fact that bund yields rose
significantly opened the door for some correction. For the bund,
it will depend on the evolution in the U.S.”  Italian Auction  Italy sold 1.5 billion euros of bonds due in 2044 at an
average yield of 4.99 percent. The Rome-based Treasury also
auctioned 3 billion euros of 2016 securities and 1 billion euros
of floating-rate notes maturing in 2018.  Italy’s 10-year yield dropped four basis points to 4.12
percent, while the rate on similar-maturity Spanish bonds fell
two basis points to 4.10 percent.  Volatility on Dutch bonds was the highest in the euro-area
markets, followed by those of the Netherlands and  France ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities and credit-default swaps. Dutch 10-year yields fell five basis points to 2.08 percent.  German government bonds lost 1.6 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spain’s
returned 11 percent and Italy’s earned 6.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
