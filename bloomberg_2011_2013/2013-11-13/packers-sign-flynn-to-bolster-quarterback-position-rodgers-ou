The Green Bay Packers signed
quarterback  Matt Flynn  after losing starter  Aaron Rodgers  and
backup Seneca Wallace to injuries, General Manager Ted Thompson
said.  Rodgers has been ruled out of this weekendâ€™s National
Football League game against the New York Giants as he recovers
from a fractured collarbone. Rodgers was injured in a 27-20 loss
to the Chicago Bears on Nov. 4.  Wallace replaced Rodgers on Nov. 10 against the
Philadelphia Eagles, playing one series before leaving the game
that the Packers lost 27-13.  Third-string quarterback Scott Tolzien will be the starter
against the Giants on Nov. 17.  Flynn, 28, was drafted by the Packers in the seventh round
of the 2008 NFL Draft and played four seasons in  Green Bay ,
completing 82 of 132 passes for 1,015 yards and nine touchdowns
with five interceptions.  Flynn played for the Seattle Seahawks last year and was
with the Oakland Raiders and Buffalo Bills this season.  To contact the reporter on this story: Nancy Kercheval in
