Taiwan  dollar forwards dropped to
the lowest level in almost two months on speculation the U.S.
will start cutting stimulus as soon as December.  Global funds sold $87 million more domestic equities than
they bought in November, after bringing in $7 billion in the
prior two months as the  Federal Reserve  maintained its monthly
asset purchases. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries climbed to
an eight-week high as Fed Bank of Atlanta President  Dennis
Lockhart  said reducing bond buying “ought to be on the table at
upcoming meetings” by the central bank, including Dec. 17-18.  “The direction of fund flows isn’t as consistently
positive as before,” said Scott Chen, a Taipei-based economist
at Bank SinoPac. “As returns on U.S. Treasuries rise, the
relative attractiveness of emerging-market equities has
declined.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards on Taiwan’s dollar fell
0.1 percent to NT$29.596 per dollar as of 10:10 a.m. in Taipei,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts touched
NT$29.620 today, the weakest level since Sept. 17.  In the  spot market , the currency was at NT$29.618 against
the greenback, from NT$29.636 yesterday, prices from Taipei
Forex Inc. show. The local dollar lost 0.2 percent in the last
eight minutes of trading yesterday amid suspected central bank
intervention. The monetary authority has sold the currency in
the run-up to the close on most days since March 2012, according
to traders who asked not to be identified.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, decreased six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.37 percent.  Bonds Gain  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due October 2018
dropped one basis point to 1.141 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was
steady at 0.388 percent, a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center showed.  U.S. employers added 204,000 workers last month, official
figures showed Nov. 8, compared with the 120,000 median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg survey. Separate Bloomberg polls
conducted Nov. 8 and Oct. 17-18 showed economists predict the
Fed will maintain the level of its monthly bond purchases at $85
billion until March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
