Bangladesh will raise the  minimum
wage  for the country’s garment workers by 77 percent to 5,300
taka ($68) following a labor dispute that shut factories in the
Ashulia industrial zone on the outskirts of the capital Dhaka.  The wage increase will be effective from Dec. 1, Labor
Minister Rajiuddin Ahmed Raju said at a media briefing
yesterday. The announcement came after workers’ protests that
forced about 250 garment factories to close and Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina urged factory owners to accept the pay
recommendation made by a government-appointed panel.  Ashulia factories account for 35 percent of Bangladesh’s
garment output and supply retailers including  Hennes & Mauritz
AB (HMB)  and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , according to Abdus Salam Murshedy,
president of the Exporters Association of  Bangladesh . The South
Asian nation has struggled to rebuild its image after the April
collapse of the Rana Plaza factory complex killed more than
1,100 people in the country’s worst industrial disaster.  In September, thousands of demonstrators demanding higher
wages forced the closure of 400 of the country’s 5,000 clothing
factories. The protests reflect the rising labor tensions in
Bangladesh, which has the lowest wages in Asia after Myanmar.  Its cheap labor has spawned a $20 billion garment industry,
the world’s second largest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
