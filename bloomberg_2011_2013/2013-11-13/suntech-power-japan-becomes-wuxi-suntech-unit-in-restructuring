Suntech Power Holdings Corp., the
Chinese maker of solar panels whose main unit was dragged into
bankruptcy in March, has transferred shares in its  Japan  unit to
Wuxi Suntech Power Co. as part of its restructuring.  Tokyo-based Suntech Power Japan, which had been a wholly-owned unit of Suntech Power, will continue to sell solar power
generation systems and provide maintenance services in Japan,
the unit said in an e-mailed statement today.  Wuxi Suntech was pulled into bankruptcy in March. A
creditors meeting yesterday approved a plan for Wuxi Suntech to
be acquired by Jiangsu Shunfeng Photovoltaic Technology Co.,
according to the statement.  A unit in  Singapore  also had its shares transferred to Wuxi
Suntech, Suntech Power Japan said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
