NTT Docomo Inc. (9437) ,  Japan ’s largest
mobile-phone operator, said the addition of Apple Inc.’s iPhone
to its handset lineup in September is helping reduce subscriber
losses to competing carriers.  Docomo lost about 93,000 subscribers net to  KDDI Corp. (9433)  and
 SoftBank Corp. (9984)  last month and wants to cut that amount to
between 40,000 and 50,000 a month, Chief Financial Officer
Kazuto Tsubouchi said during an interview yesterday. During the
first nine months of this year, Docomo lost an average of
141,050 subscribers a month to other carriers, the company said.  The last major Japanese carrier to start selling the iPhone
had resisted adding the handset because Apple’s iTunes store
competes directly with Docomo’s dmarket, its online store for
music, videos and games. SoftBank was the first of the nation’s
operators to offer the iPhone when it began sales in 2008 before
KDDI followed in 2011 and Docomo on Sept. 20.  “From October, the number of customers exiting has
decreased quite a lot,” Tsubouchi said at the company’s
headquarters in  Tokyo . “If we can even get that down to a small
minus figure that we can forecast -- in sumo terms, we’ll have
gotten right back into the middle of the ring.”  Japanese telecommunications companies are looking for ways
to boost revenue through acquisitions at home and abroad as
growth stalls because of a declining population. Docomo said
last month it will acquire a 51 percent stake in the Japanese
cooking school operator ABC Holdings to boost smartphone
content, and SoftBank led a $1.53 billion deal for control of
Finnish game maker Supercell Oy.  ‘Considering Targets’  “We are always considering targets that will expand our
earnings,” Tsubouchi said. A company that allows for the
distribution of content is more attractive than a carrier, the
executive said.  In July, SoftBank  bought   Overland Park , Kansas-based  Sprint
Corp (S)  for $21.6 billion, adding the third-largest U.S. carrier.  “SoftBank appears to have judged if they bring their
network technology over there, they can increase value,”
Tsubouchi said.  Docomo’s  net income  rose to 142.4 billion yen ($1.4
billion) in the three months ended Sept. 30, the company said in
a statement Oct. 25. That beat the 133 billion-yen average of
three analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Docomo added 37,100 net users in October, while SoftBank
gained 229,400 and KDDI added 158,900. Docomo still dominates
the Japanese wireless sector with 44.5 percent of the market.
