Extended Stay America Inc. (STAY) , the
largest owner of mid-price long-stay hotels in the U.S., jumped
19 percent in its trading debut after raising $565 million in an
initial public offering.  Extended Stay closed at $23.87 after selling 28.25 million
shares at $20 each. The company, led by former Starbucks Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Jim Donald, initially offered the stock
for $18 to $21.  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Extended Stay,
which was held equally by  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , Centerbridge
Partners LP and Paulson & Co., will use proceeds to pay debt,
according to a regulatory filing. None of the firms sold shares.  Extended Stay, which owns and operates almost 700 hotels
with about 76,000 rooms in the U.S. and  Canada , went public
three years after its owners bought the company out of
bankruptcy and invested about $626 million in renovations that
are close to completion. The investors are taking advantage of
hotel stocks close to all-time highs and a  rebound  in room rates
and occupancies to extend the busiest year for real estate IPOs
since 2004, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Extended Stay sold paired common stock, comprising one
share of the company and one Class B share of a related entity
that is taxed as a real estate investment trust, the filing
shows. Each paired share is trading as one unit, listed on the
 New York  Stock Exchange under the ticker STAY.  Extended Stay sold about 14.1 percent of the company in the
IPO, giving it a market value of about $4 billion. The $565
million raised excludes 4.24 million shares the underwriters
could sell to meet demand, called the overallotment, or green
shoe. That would increase IPO proceeds to $649.75 million.  Higher Occupancies  Lower-priced long-stay hotels such as Extended Stay’s
properties filled 69.8 percent of their rooms on average in
2012, compared with 61.3 percent for all U.S. lodging, according
to travel-research firm STR. At higher-priced extended-stay
hotels, occupancy averaged 76.3 percent last year.  Extended Stay has added amenities such as Wi-Fi and
breakfast to charge higher room rates. The company, whose
average daily  rate  was $52.34 during the 12 months through June,
has said it’s trying to attract more shorter-stay and corporate
guests who would pay higher rates.  “You’re just seeing more bifurcation in the industry,”
said Steve Hennis, a director at the STR Analytics unit of
Hendersonville, Tennessee-based STR. Lower-tier extended-stay
hotels charged an average daily rate of $54.77 last year,
compared with $119.88 for upper-level long-stay companies,
according to the firm.  Kansas Start  Extended-stay hotel rooms are equipped with kitchens and
are rented by the week or month by people including executives
relocating, construction workers on a project away from home and
families going through a move.  The industry got its start in 1975, when real estate
developer Jack DeBoer opened the first Residence Inn in Wichita,
 Kansas , eventually selling the chain to Marriott International
Inc. in 1987, according to fact sheets provided by Marriott and
DeBoer’s office. In 1988, DeBoer, now 82, co-founded the
Summerfield chain, later selling that company to Hyatt Hotels
Corp. and, in 1995, started the Candlewood chain, which was
 bought  by  InterContinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG)  in January 2004,
according to DeBoer’s office and Bloomberg data.  Also in 1995, billionaire Wayne Huizenga and his business
partner George Johnson founded Extended Stay America, expanding
it to 472 properties by the time they sold the company to
Blackstone in May 2004 for $3.1 billion.  Blackstone sold it three years later, close to the top of
the market, for $8 billion to Lightstone Group LLC, which put
the debt-laden company into bankruptcy protection after the
credit crisis. In 2010, the current owners bought Extended Stay
for $3.9 billion. The IPO will almost triple the value of their
realized and unrealized holdings in the company, according to
Bloomberg calculations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
