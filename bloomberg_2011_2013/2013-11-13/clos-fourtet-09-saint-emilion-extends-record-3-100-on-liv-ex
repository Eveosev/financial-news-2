Eighteen bottles of Clos Fourtet
2009 Saint-Emilion sold for the equivalent of 1,950 pounds
($3,100) a case on the Liv-ex wine exchange this month, the
third straight month the vintage has traded at or near a record.  The transactions on Nov. 7 and yesterday followed the sale
of three cases also for 1,950 pounds on Oct. 21, while a similar
case fetched 1,931 pounds on Sept. 13, according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website. All of those prices exceeded the
trading level of 1,900 pounds first reached in March.  While the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, tracking leading
Bordeaux vintages, may be heading for its third consecutive year
of declines after falling below its end-2012 level in the past
week, wines from Saint-Emilion and Pomerol on the right bank of
the Dordogne have outperformed some higher-priced Medoc vintages
as collectors and investors sought more diversification.  “Right Bank wines have performed well overall, benefiting
from good scores and solid price gains in a year which has seen
many Bordeaux prices in stasis,” Liv-ex said in a market blog
commentary.  Clos Fourtet is a Premier Grand Cru Classe Saint-Emilion
wine estate, putting it among the top 18 in the district. Its
2009 vintage, made under the ownership of Philippe Cuvelier,
comprised 88 percent Merlot grapes, 8 percent  Cabernet Sauvignon 
and 4 percent Cabernet Franc, according to notes on the estate’s
 website . The wine was aged for 18 months in barrels, with 80
percent new oak.  Medieval Fort  The vintage has risen 21 percent from its trading level at
the end of last year, and tripled from the 640 pounds a case at
which it traded in June 2010 on Liv-ex, soon after being
released to the market.  It was rated a perfect 100 on U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker ’s scale, making it the estate’s best vintage on record
according to that measure and ahead of the 2005 and 2010
vintages, which scored 98 each.  The vineyard lies at the entrance to the medieval village
of Saint-Emilion and was called Camp Fourtet in the Middle Ages,
when a fort on the site protected the town, according to the
winery’s website. There is now an eighteenth-century manor house
in its place.  The estate has 19 hectares (47 acres) of vineyards,
according to the website of London wine importer  Berry Bros. &
Rudd , and its reputation was built up in the latter part of the
twentieth century by Pierre Lurton, who went on to take over
direction of winemaking at nearby Chateau Cheval Blanc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
