Consolidated Water Co. (CWCO) , the
Caribbean’s largest publicly traded water supplier, reported a
30 percent drop in third-quarter profit as retail sales fell on
its home island in the Caymans.  Net income slid from $1.3 million in the year-earlier
period as larger customers on the island, popular for its beach
resorts, purchased lower volumes of water “likely due to
greater rainfall,” the Georgetown, Cayman Islands-based company
said in a statement.  Consolidated Water has expanded this year beyond the
Caribbean with a 100 million gallon per day water-purifying
desalination pilot plant in Rosarito in northern  Baja
California , Mexico, that’s completed its first phase and a
seawater reverse-osmosis facility on Indonesia’s Bali island.  Consolidated Water operates water production and
distribution facilities in the Caymans, Bahamas, Belize and the
British Virgin Islands. The shares have doubled this year in  New
York  trading compared with a 6.3 percent gain by the 20-member
Bloomberg World Water Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
