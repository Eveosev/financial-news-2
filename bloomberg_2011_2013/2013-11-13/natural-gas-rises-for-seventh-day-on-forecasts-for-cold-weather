Natural gas futures dropped from a
two-week high in New York amid speculation that a government
report tomorrow will show a U.S. inventory gain that’s above
average for this time of year.  Gas slid 1.4 percent as the Energy Information
Administration may say stockpiles expanded by 22 billion cubic
feet last week, based on the median of 18  analyst estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Estimates ranged from gains of 2 billion
to 33 billion. The five-year average injection for the week is
19 billion. Supplies fell 12 billion a year earlier.  “The concern is that we still have ample supplies to meet
this upcoming heating demand,” said Teri Viswanath, director of
commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA in New York. “That,
combined with expectations of continued production growth, is
making investors think twice about running this up.”  Natural gas for December delivery fell 5.1 cents to settle
at $3.566 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, breaking a six-day streak of gains. Prices
yesterday rose to $3.617, the highest closing price since Oct.
30. Trading volume was 4.5 percent below the 100-day average at
2:47 p.m. Prices have climbed 6.4 percent this year.  The discount of December to January futures widened 0.3
cent to 5.2 cents. March gas traded 1.1 cents  above  the April
contract, unchanged from yesterday.  January $4 calls were the most active options in electronic
trading. They were 1.4 cents lower at 4.2 cents per million Btu
on volume of 356 at 3:32 p.m. Calls accounted for 49 percent of
trading volume.  Below Normal  “Temperatures this week are far cooler and should
translate into a significant storage withdrawal,” which is the
chief support for prices in the near-term, Tim Evans, an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York, said in a note
to clients today. “The updated temperature forecast is somewhat
mixed, taking away some heating demand from the current week,
but adding it back in the” 6- to 10-day and 11- to 15-day
forecast periods.  Temperatures from the East Coast through the Midwest and
 Texas  will be below normal from Nov. 18 through Nov. 27,
according to MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . The
low in New York City on Nov. 20 may be 27 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 3 Celsius), 13 lower than average, and  Chicago  may be 9
below normal at 23 degrees, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in
State College,  Pennsylvania .  About 49 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Gas inventories  totaled 3.814 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Nov. 1, 1.5 percent above the five-year  average  for
the period, EIA data show.  Record Production  The U.S. raised its production forecast for 2013 by 0.4
percent to 70.29 billion cubic feet a day from 70 billion the
previous month, the EIA said today in its  Short-Term Energy
Outlook . Output will climb 1.6 percent from the 2012 record of
69.18 billion.  “In the past several months, natural gas production has
hit record high levels, even as prices declined this summer,”
the EIA said in its monthly report. “The Marcellus shale has
been the main driver of growth.”  Production in the Marcellus shale deposit in the Northeast
may climb 3.3 percent in December to 12.9 billion cubic feet a
day from an estimated 12.5 billion in November, the EIA said
yesterday in its monthly  Drilling Productivity Report .  Technologies such as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking,
have made it more economical to drill in shale rock to extract
fuel. The U.S. produced 86 percent of its own energy in the
first seven months of this year, on pace to be the highest
annual rate since 1986, according to data from the EIA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
