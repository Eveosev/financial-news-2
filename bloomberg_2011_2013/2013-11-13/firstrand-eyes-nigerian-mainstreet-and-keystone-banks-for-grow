FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , South Africa’s
second-biggest financial-services company, would consider buying
 Nigeria ’s Mainstreet Bank Ltd. or Keystone Bank Ltd. to help
establish a consumer-banking presence in the country.  The lenders are held by Nigeria’s Asset Management Corp.
which was set up in 2010 to nationalize and manage the banks
after bad debts mounted amid allegations of corruption. Amcon,
as its known, already asked for expressions of interest in
Enterprise Bank Ltd. and hopes to sell all three lenders by the
end of next year, according to a  statement  on its website.  “We would not be interested in Enterprise but would
consider both Keystone and Mainstreet,” Sam Moss, director of
 investor relations  at FirstRand, said in an e-mailed response to
questions today. “There’s no formal process yet and we have no
idea when it will start.”  The three Nigerian banks were among eight bailed out by the
 Central Bank of Nigeria  in 2009 amid a lending crisis that
threatened the financial system in sub-Saharan Africa’s second-largest economy. FirstRand last year set up an investment bank
in Nigeria and wants to follow that with retail operations to
help fund the unit while profiting from growth in Africa’s most
populous country.  FirstRand ended talks to buy Nigeria’s Sterling Bank Plc in
2011 after the parties were unable to agree on terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
