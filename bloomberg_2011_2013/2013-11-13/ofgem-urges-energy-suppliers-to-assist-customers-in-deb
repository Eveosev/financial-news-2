The U.K. energy regulator called on
power and gas suppliers to help struggling customers as it
revealed that 5 percent of accounts were in debt last year.  “Energy bills are rising and household budgets are
tight,” Sarah Harrison, senior partner for sustainable
development at regulator Ofgem, said today in a  statement . “It
is more important than ever before that energy suppliers do all
they can to help customers who are struggling to manage bills.”  Five of Britain’s six biggest energy companies recently
announced price increases, which they blamed in part on levies
for government-run green programs. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
responded by ordering a review of the environmental charges,
which added an average 112 pounds ($179) to bills this year.  About 1.36 million electricity accounts and 1.19 million
gas accounts were in arrears in 2012, Ofgem said today. Some
suppliers have started to take into account customers’ ability
to pay, cutting disconnections to a record low of 557 last year,
it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
