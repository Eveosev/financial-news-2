Bonds of Momentive Performance
Materials Inc. fell after the manufacturer of specialty
chemicals reported its twelfth-straight quarterly loss.  The company’s $381.9 million of 11.5 percent subordinated
notes due December 2016 dropped 3 cents to 71 cents on the
dollar at 11:42 a.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. Yields on the notes have climbed to 25.9 percent from
this year’s low of 17.2 percent in May.  The silicone maker owned by Apollo Global Management LLC
reported a net loss of $67 million in the third quarter, making
it three years since the  Albany , New York-based company made
money. The private-equity firm headed by Billionaire Leon Black
bought the chemical company in 2006 for $3.8 billion.  The losses have led to a cash burn that started at the end
of 2011 and now leaves the company about seven months before it
runs out of money, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Momentive has about $3.3 billion of debt outstanding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
