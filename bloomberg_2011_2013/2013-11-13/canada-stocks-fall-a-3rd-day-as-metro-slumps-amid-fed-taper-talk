Canadian  stocks  rose, halting two
days of losses, as gains among lenders and energy producers
overshadowed disappointing retailer results while investors
weighed the timing of any Federal Reserve stimulus cuts.  Semafo Inc. rallied 8.9 percent after the miner said it
received approval to develop two new deposits.  Royal Bank (RY)  of
Canada climbed 1.7 percent to pace gains among financial stocks.
Suncor Energy Inc. added 2 percent as crude prices climbed.
Grocery retailers  Loblaw Cos. (L)  and Metro Inc. tumbled at least
5.7 percent on disappointing earnings.  CAE Inc. (CAE)  dropped 0.6
percent as the aviation training company faced declining revenue
in its civil and military segments.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 44.62
points, or 0.3 percent, to 13,370.66 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, after
declining as much as 0.3 percent earlier. The benchmark Canadian
equity gauge has advanced 7.5 percent this year, the third-worst
performance among global developed markets, ahead of  Hong Kong 
and  Singapore .  “One of the main drivers around the market performance is
the comments from the Fed,” said Anish Chopra,  fund manager 
with TD Asset Management Inc. in Toronto. He helps manage C$216
billion ($206 billion) with the firm. “There’s always some
uncertainty around tapering, but it looks like tapering could be
earlier.”  Fed Bank of Atlanta President  Dennis Lockhart  said
yesterday a paring of U.S. bond purchases “could very well take
place” next month. Investors have been watching for clues on
when the central bank will begin to reduce monetary support as
the economy recovers. The stimulus has helped fuel a global
rally in equities.  Lenders Rise  Eight of 10 groups in the benchmark Canadian index advanced
today, with energy and financial shares adding at last 0.5
percent. Trading volume was 7.5 percent above the 30-day average
at this time of the day.  Royal Bank rose 1.7 percent to C$71.06, a record close, on
trading volume more than four times higher than the three-month
average. Bank of Montreal gained 0.9 percent to C$73.44.  Suncor Energy added 2 percent to C$37.23, halting two days
of declines. Oil rose 0.9 percent in  New York  on speculation
that increasing refinery profits from making gasoline and
heating oil will bolster use of the raw material.  Semafo surged 8.9 percent to C$2.95 for the biggest gain in
the S&P/TSX. The company’s chief executive officer said today it
would start production at one of the developments in 2014 and in
2015 at the other.  Grocer Competition  Loblaw sank 7.6 percent to C$44.23, the biggest slide in
six years. The nation’s largest grocer now forecasts operating
income for 2013 to be flat compared with 2012, due to higher
spending amid increasing competition.  Metro retreated 5.7 percent to C$62, the most since
November 2008. Revenue of C$2.61 billion fell short of analysts’
estimates of C$2.63 billion and same-store sales slid 1.8
percent.  Canadian grocers are under pressure as bigger U.S. rivals
such as Target Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. expand grocery
options in the country.  CAE, the St. Laurent, Quebec-based flight simulator and
training company, fell 0.6 percent to C$11.96, paring earlier
losses, after reporting second-quarter revenue of C$487.5
million, short of analysts’ estimates of C$536.5 million.  The company also increased its  dividend  20 percent, to 6
Canadian cents a share from 5 cents.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd., a copper miner, declined 4.3
percent to C$18.56 as the price of the metal fell the most in 15
weeks. Copper output in  China  rose to a monthly record in
October.  NuVista Energy Ltd. (NVA)  decreased 3.7 percent to C$7.05. The
Calgary-based energy company yesterday said it will sell 11
million shares at C$7.10 a share to raise about C$78.1 million.
It plans to use the cash to pay down debt and help fund its 2013
and 2014 capital program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
