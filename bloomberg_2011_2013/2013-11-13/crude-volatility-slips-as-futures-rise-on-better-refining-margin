Crude options volatility declined as
the underlying futures rose on speculation that increasing
refinery profits from making gasoline and heating oil will
bolster use of the raw material.  Implied volatility for at-the-money January options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
18.3 percent at 4:35 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
down from 18.76 yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate for January delivery climbed 97
cents to $94.49 a barrel on the Nymex. WTI crude for December
delivery rose 84 cents to $93.88. December WTI options expire
Nov. 15. Futures have averaged $96.92 in the past year.  Oil prices  “continue to hover right around the midpoint
from the last two years,”  Stephen Schork , president of the
Schork Group Inc. energy research firm in Villanova,
 Pennsylvania , said by telephone today. “We essentially had that
big pop in prices in the summer, we had that correction and now
the market is trying to find a home inside this range.
Volatility is going to continue to fall as we settle into this
range.”  Puts protecting against a 10 percent drop in prices dropped
to 23.71 percent from 24.52 in the prior session. The skew, or
premium of puts over calls, narrowed to 5.69 percent from 6.81
yesterday.  Puts accounted for 54 percent of electronic trading volume
today. The most-active options were December $95 calls, which
added 4 cents to 21 cents a barrel with 3,896 lots trading as of
4:41 p.m.  New York  time. December $92 puts dropped 24 cents to
18 cents on volume of 3,065 lots.  Previous Session  In the previous session, puts accounted for 59 percent of
the 187,234 lots traded. December $95 calls declined 70 cents to
17 cents a barrel on 9,243 contracts. January $85 puts gained 11
cents to 29 cents on volume of 8,216 lots.  Open interest yesterday was highest for December $80 puts,
with 43,234 contracts. Next were December $85 puts with 36,674
lots and December $90 puts with 36,131.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
