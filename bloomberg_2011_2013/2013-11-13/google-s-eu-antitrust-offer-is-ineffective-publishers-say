A group of European publishers
criticized  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s offer to settle a European Union
antitrust probe as “ineffective,” saying it doesn’t solve
competition issues.  Google’s proposal to auction links on its search results to
some rivals would generate additional revenue for the world’s
largest search engine without addressing alleged discrimination
in search rankings, the German newspaper publishers’ federation
BDZV and other publishing associations said in a  statement .  The European Commission last month sought feedback from
rivals on Google’s latest offer to allow it to end the three-year investigation into allegations that Google promotes its
specialist search services, copies competitors’ travel and
restaurant reviews, and has agreements with websites and
software developers that stifle competition in the advertising
industry.  “The commitments would legitimize Google’s current
practice of placing own services first and even turn the traffic
to competing services into a new and lucrative revenue stream
for Google,” the publishers said.  They asked the EU to end settlement talks and send Google a
formal complaint listing possible antitrust concerns.  Google, based in  Mountain View ,  California , said it had
made significant changes to increase the visibility of rival
services to address EU concerns.  “Unfortunately, our competitors seem less interested in
resolving things than in entangling us in a never-ending
dispute,” Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels, said
in an e-mail.  Google isn’t proposing to sell links to news sites, the
publishers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
