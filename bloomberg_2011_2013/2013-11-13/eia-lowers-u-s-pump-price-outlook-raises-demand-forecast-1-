The U.S. Energy Information
Administration lowered its  forecast  for 2013 U.S. gasoline pump
prices by 2 cents to $3.50 a gallon.  The EIA increased its outlook for  consumption  of the motor
fuel by 0.2 percent from last month’s estimate to 8.73 million
barrels a day. Demand in 2014 may be 8.69 million barrels a day,
up from last month’s forecast of 8.67 million, the statistical
arm of the Energy Department said today in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook.  Prices in the fourth quarter will average $3.24 a gallon,
the EIA said, down from the previous forecast of $3.34, and in
2014 will average $3.39, a penny below last month’s outlook.
Prices in 2012 averaged $3.63 a gallon.  Distillate demand, including diesel and heating oil, will
be 3.83 million barrels a day this year and 3.91 million in
2014, unchanged from last month’s outlook.  On-road  diesel fuel  will average $3.91 a gallon this year,
lower than last month’s forecast of $3.93. Next year, prices may
drop to $3.73 a gallon, compared with last month’s estimate of
$3.76.  Households in the U.S. that use heating oil will pay $2,006
this  winter , down from $2,049 in last month’s estimate, the EIA
said. The cost to heat a home with natural gas will be $665,
down from $679 forecast in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
