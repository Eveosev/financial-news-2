Enel Green Power Ltd. (EGPW) , a unit of
 Enel SpA (ENEL) , will complete its second Chilean wind farm this month.  Enel Green’s 90-megawatt Valle de los Vientos wind farm
will start sending electricity to Chile’s northern power grid
next month, Enel Green business development executive Martino
Pasti said in a Santiago interview today.  Enel Green inaugurated its Talinay wind farm in central
Chile earlier this year, providing 90 megawatts, and started
construction of a third farm near Taltal at a cost of $190
million that will provide 99 megawatts, according to a company
statement.  Chile introduced a law earlier this year requiring 20
percent of all power to come from renewable energy excluding
large-scale hydroelectric dams. The South American country
imports more than 90 percent of its fossil-fuel needs.  Enel Green will also start construction on Chile’s first
geothermal power plant next year in Ollague that will be ready
in 2015 to supply a power station near  Freeport-McMoRan Copper &
Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Grasberg copper mine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
