Ford Motor Co. (F) , the second-largest
U.S. automaker, said it will protect its Ford script and oval
logo from use by supporters of embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford.  Rob Ford, 44, yesterday signed shirts emblazoned with
“Ford Nation” incorporating the automaker’s logo at a United
Way charity event, the National Post newspaper reported. The
mayor said for the first time today he bought illegal drugs
while in office after admitting last week to using  crack cocaine 
and being drunk in public.  “Ford did not grant permission for use of its logo,” Jay Cooney, a company spokesman, said today by telephone. “We view
it as an unauthorized use of our trademark and have asked it to
be stopped.”  Ford reclaimed control of its blue oval logo last year
after using it and other assets as collateral to borrow $23.4
billion in 2006 which allowed the company to weather the global
financial crisis. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company regained
control after Moody’s Investors Service became the second major
ratings company to upgrade the carmaker to investment grade.  Rob Ford’s revelation today that he purchased illegal drugs
while in office came amid questioning at a city hall meeting in
which a majority of city councilors asked him to take a leave of
absence to address his “challenges.”  Ford rose 2.3 percent to $17.10 at the close in  New York .
The shares have surged 32 percent this year, compared with a 25
percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
