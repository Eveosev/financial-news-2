Corn futures traded in South Africa
fell after three sessions of advances and wheat prices retreated
for the first time in a week.  White corn for delivery in December slid 1.4 percent to
2,430 rand ($235) a metric ton by the close on the South African
Futures Exchange in Johannesburg. Yellow corn for delivery in
the same month dropped 0.3 percent to 2,380 rand a ton.  South Africa is the continentâ€™s biggest corn producer. A
meal made from white corn is a staple food in the nation and the
yellow variety of the grain is mostly fed to animals  Wheat for delivery in December lost 0.6 percent to 3,570
rand a ton, the first decline since Nov. 6. Prices reached the
highest level since June for a most-active contract on Nov. 11,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
