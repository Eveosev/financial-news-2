Flybe Group Plc (FLYB) ’s largest
shareholder sold its entire stake, lifting the number of
publicly-held shares in Europe’s largest regional airline and
locking in gains after the stock more than doubled this year.  Rosedale Aviation Holdings Ltd. sold its 48.1 percent stake
to existing and new shareholders in a transaction valued at 37
million pounds ($59 million), based on Flybe’s closing price
yesterday. Shares were placed with institutional investors by
Liberum Capital Ltd, the Exeter, England-based carrier said.  Flybe Chief Executive Officer Saad Hammad this week
announced plans to cut 500 jobs, about 20 percent of payroll,
amid a review of its fleet and network to restore finances
hampered by high fuel costs and weak economic growth. The
measures will incur additional costs this year and next.  “The turnaround of Flybe is gaining momentum,” Hammad
said, calling the stock sale a “milestone” in Flybe’s history.  Flybe has tripled in value this year, following  two years 
of negative returns after the airline’s initial public offering
three years ago. The carrier, also the U.K.’s biggest domestic
airline, this week posted a pretax profit of 13.8 million pounds
in the first half -- which included the busiest summer months --
versus a 1.6 million-pound loss a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
