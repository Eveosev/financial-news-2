Codexis Inc. (CDXS) , the California-based
producer of enzymes for biochemicals, slumped to a record low
after sales plunged and the company said it’s exiting the
biofuel market.  Codexis  declined  15 percent to $1.46 at the close in New
York, the lowest since its initial public offering in April
2010.  The company, based in  Redwood City , will focus exclusively
on enzymes for pharmaceuticals and chemicals, Chief Executive
Officer John Nicols said yesterday on an earnings call with
analysts. A partnership with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  to develop
enzymes for biofuels ended last year and Codexis was unable to
make the technology commercially viable.  “We have fought an uphill battle against a number of
external forces” to produce biofuel enzymes, Nicols said. Those
include “the growth of cheap and abundant non-renewable fuel
sources, the shifted fuel strategy of our prior partnership with
Shell, the delayed economic validation timelines for cellulosic
ethanol technologies and the rising political sentiment against
ethanol’s growth in the fuel pool.”  Revenue in the third quarter was $3.9 million, down 85
percent from a year earlier. The company’s net loss more than
tripled to $9.2 million, or 24 cents a share.  Codexis expects 2013 revenue of $30 million to $32 million,
down from an earlier forecast of $35 million to $40 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
