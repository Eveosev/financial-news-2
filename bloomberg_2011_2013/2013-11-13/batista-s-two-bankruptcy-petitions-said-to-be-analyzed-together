Eike Batista ’s two companies’
bankruptcy-protection requests will be analyzed jointly and by
the same judge and court in Rio de Janeiro, according to two
people familiar with the matter.  The companies’ lawyers asked for the joint analysis to try
to speed up the process and judge Gilberto Matos approved, the
people said, asking not to be named because the decision isn’t
public. That doesn’t mean that the so-called judicial recovery
of the shipbuilder  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3)  and it’s biggest client, oil
company  OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA , will have the same
ending, the people said.  OSX filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday and didn’t
included its leasing unit, through which it owns the OSX-1,
OSX-2 and OSX-3 platforms, as part of the judicial recovery
petition. OSX’s board approved the filing on Nov. 8 and Nov. 9.  The court in Rio de Janeiro declined to comment, according
to an official who asked not to be named.  To contact the reporter on this story:
