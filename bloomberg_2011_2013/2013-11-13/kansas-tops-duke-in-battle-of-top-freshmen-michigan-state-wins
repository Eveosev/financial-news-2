Andrew Wiggins scored 16 of his 22
points in the second half as the University of  Kansas  beat  Duke
University  94-83 to spoil Jabari Parker’s return to his
hometown.  Wiggins contributed six points as the No. 5 Jayhawks
outscored the fourth-ranked Blue Devils 15-4 in the last two
minutes, 53 seconds in college basketball’s Champions Classic at
United Center in  Chicago  last night.  Perry Ellis led Kansas with 24 points, while Parker had a
game-high 27 points and nine rebounds for Duke.  Wiggins, who had 10 rebounds, and Parker are seen as two of
the best prospects in college basketball in recent years and
have been tipped to enter the National Basketball Association
draft after their freshman years. Duke leads the series against
Kansas 7-3.  Wayne Selden Jr. and Frank Mason each contributed 15 points
for the Jayhawks (2-0), while Amile Jefferson scored 17 points
and Rasheed Sulaimon came off the bench to add 13 points for the
Blue Devils (1-1).  In a meeting of the top-ranked teams, No. 2 Michigan State
defeated No. 1  Kentucky  78-74, also at the United Center. Keith
Appling scored 22 points to lead the Spartans (2-0), with Gary
Harris adding 20 points.  Julius Randle had a game-high 27 points and 13 rebounds for
the Wildcats (2-1), while James Young scored 19 points.  Michigan State took advantage of early turnovers by
Kentucky to open a 44-32 halftime lead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
