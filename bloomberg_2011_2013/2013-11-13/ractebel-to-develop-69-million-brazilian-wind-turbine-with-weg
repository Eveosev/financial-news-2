Tractebel Energia SA (TBLE3) , Brazilâ€™s
biggest power utility by market value, and equipment supplier
WEG SA will spend 160 million reais ($69 million) developing a
wind turbine using local technology.  The companies plan to install a 3.3-megawatt turbine next
to the Jorge Lacerda coal-fired power plant in four years,
Florianopolis-based Tractebel said today in an e-mailed
statement.  WEG will invest 88 million reais in the project and
Tractebel the rest, according to the statement.  Most wind turbines in Brazil have been designed and
developed abroad, Yayoi Sekine, a Sao Paulo-based analyst for
Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said today in a telephone
interview.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
