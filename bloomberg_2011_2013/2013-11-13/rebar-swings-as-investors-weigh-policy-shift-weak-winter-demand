Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  swung between gains and losses as investors weighed
positive long-term policy shifts in  China  against the short-term
outlook for weaker demand in winter.  Rebar for May delivery, the most-active contract on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange, was 0.2 percent lower at 3,663 yuan
($601) a metric ton at 10:19 a.m. local time after earlier
rising as much as 0.2 percent and falling 0.5 percent.  China will make markets “decisive” in allocating
resources, according to a communique after a four-day Communist
Party meeting. Such shift may lead to less government
involvement in the long-term, eventually reducing overcapacity
in industries from steel making to aluminum smelting, said Wang Yongliang, an analyst at Beijing Cifco Futures Co. in Tianjin.  “Rebar is trapped in a tight range now as investors absorb
these long-term policy implications with the current weak
seasonal demand in winter,” Wang said.  Iron ore for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
rose 0.2 percent to 945  yuan  a ton. The steel-making material
for immediate delivery at Tianjin port tracked by The Steel
Index was unchanged at $135.90 a dry ton yesterday.  The spot price of rebar fell 0.1 percent to 3,553 yuan
yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development
Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
