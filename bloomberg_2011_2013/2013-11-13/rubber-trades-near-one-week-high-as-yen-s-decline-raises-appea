Rubber traded near a one-week high
after  Japan ’s currency slid to the lowest level in two months
against the dollar, raising the appeal of yen-based futures.  The contract for April delivery on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange advanced as much as 1 percent to 261.2 yen a kilogram
($2,623 a metric ton) and traded at 258.8 yen at 11:03 a.m.
Futures settled at 258.6 on Nov. 11, the highest level since
Nov. 1.  The yen was at 99.53 per dollar after declining to 99.80
yesterday, the lowest level since Sept. 13. Fed Bank of Atlanta
President  Dennis Lockhart  said yesterday a reduction in U.S.
bond purchases “could very well take place” next month.  “Expectations for U.S. tapering of monetary stimulus are
weakening the yen and giving support to futures in Tokyo,” said
Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research company JSC Corp.  Gains were limited after a group of major producers
forecast an increase in output, he said. Natural-rubber
production may rise 3.6 percent to 11 million tons this year
from 2012, Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries
said in a report yesterday.  Output in  Thailand , the world’s largest grower, may gain
2.3 percent to 3.866 million tons, while production in
 Indonesia , the second biggest, may expand 4.6 percent to 3.18
million tons, the report said.  Rubber for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
was little changed at 19,245  yuan  ($3,159) a ton. Thai rubber
free-on-board lost 0.3 percent to 78.80 baht ($2.49) a kilogram
yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
