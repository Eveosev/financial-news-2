Ibovespa  futures  dropped, after the
stock gauge yesterday fell the most in three weeks, as lower
metal prices dimmed the outlook for producers and Brazil’s
retail sales growth trailed forecasts.  State-controlled oil company  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  may
move after it agreed to sell assets in Peru to PetroChina Co.
for $2.6 billion.  Banco do Brasil SA  may be active after
JPMorgan Chase & Co. lowered its recommendation on the bank to
the equivalent of hold.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in December dropped 0.4
percent to 51,670 at 9:16 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real climbed
0.1 percent to 2.3289 per  U.S. dollar . The Bloomberg Base Metals
3-Month Price Commodity Index declined 0.8 percent on
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will start reducing stimulus
earlier than expected.  In Brazil, retail sales climbed 4.1 percent in September
from a year earlier, the national statistics agency said today.
The median  forecast  of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for
an increase of 4.6 percent.  Brazil’s main equity index entered a bull market Sept. 9
after rising 20 percent from this year’s  low  on July 3 through
that day. The gauge has since pared gains to 15 percent.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo was 7.21 billion
reais yesterday, compared with a daily average of 7.61 billion
reais this year through Oct. 22, according to the latest data
available from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
