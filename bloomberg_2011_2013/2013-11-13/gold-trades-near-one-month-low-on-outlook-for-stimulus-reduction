Gold futures capped the longest
slump in three months as global equities rebounded, reducing
demand for the metal as an alternative asset.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of  equities  gained as much
as 0.5 percent, reversing an earlier decline of as much as 0.4
percent. Investors awaited testimony tomorrow from Federal
Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  before the Senate Banking
Committee.  “Gold erased gains as equities rebounded,”  Adam
Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Archer Financial
Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The
market will be closely watching any comments from Yellen
tomorrow.”  Gold futures for delivery in December lost 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,268.40 an ounce at 1:49 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The metal fell for five straight days, the longest slump
since Aug. 6.  Bullion inventories monitored by the Comex totaled 7.16
million ounces as of yesterday, down 36 percent from a year
earlier.  Prices have fallen 24 percent this year, heading for the
first annual drop since 2000. Some investors lost faith in the
metal as a store of value amid a U.S. equity rally and low
inflation.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery slid 0.5 percent to $1,432 an ounce, while
palladium futures for December delivery fell 0.9 percent to
$735.45 an ounce.  The largest labor union at Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd.
cut its wage-increase demand by 31 percent as the parties worked
toward avoiding a possible strike at the world’s second-largest
producer of the metal,  Johan Theron , a company spokesman, said
today.  Silver futures for delivery in December dropped 1.6 percent
to $20.442 an ounce on the Comex, a fifth straight decline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
