Italy paid the lowest since March
2010 to sell three-year debt today in the first bond sale after
the  European Central Bank  unexpectedly cut its key  interest
rate .  Italy sold 3 billion euros ($4.03 billion) of three-year
notes maturing in November 2016 at 1.79 percent, the lowest
since March 30, 2010 and down from 2.25 percent at the previous
auction Oct. 11. The Treasury also sold 1.47 billion of 2044
bonds at 4.99 percent, down from 5.19 when it last sold 30-year
debt back in July, and 1 billion euros of 2018 floating bonds to
yield 2.11 percent. The total was near the 5.5 billion euros
that was the maximum target for the sale.  Last week the ECB cut its main refinancing rate to a record
low 0.25 percent after a report on Oct. 31 showed annual
inflation in the euro area slowed to 0.7 percent, the lowest
since November 2009. That boosted demand for fixed-income
assets.  Investors bid for 1.80 times the amount of three-year debt
for sale and for 1.46 the amount of the 30-year debt compared
with 1.41 and 1.30 in the previous auctions of similar maturing
debt respectively.  “All in all, demand for Italian BTPs was good today,”
Annalisa Piazza, an analyst at Newedge Group in  London , said in
a note to clients after the sale. “The relatively stable
political situation,” might also have helped.  One-year borrowing costs fell to a record low yesterday
when Italy sold 6.5 billion euros of bills.  Last week the Treasury raised a record 22.3 billion euros
of inflation-linked bonds aimed at retail investors, the biggest
single debt sale ever by a European government.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield was up 1 basis point at 4.2
percent at 11:50 a.m. in  Rome , pushing the difference with
comparable-maturing German Bunds to 237.7 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
