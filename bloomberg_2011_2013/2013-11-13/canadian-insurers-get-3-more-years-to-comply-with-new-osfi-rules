Canadian insurance companies
including  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC)  and Sun Life Financial Inc.
will have three more years to comply with new regulations from
the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions.  OSFI said it will complete its review of the life insurance
regulatory framework by 2016 rather than next year, as was
previously announced. Companies will now be required to
implement the new rules in 2018 instead of 2015, OSFI said
yesterday in a  statement .  The agency announced plans last year to revise rules for
 Canada ’s life insurance companies, including  capital
requirements  and increased transparency. It has since been
working with insurers to create the new standards.  “The revised timeline is needed to provide OSFI more time
to develop, refine and calibrate the capital framework
components, while continuing consultations with industry
stakeholders,” according to the statement. “OSFI is satisfied
that the additional time will not pose undue risks to the life
insurance industry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
