U.S. crude oil production exceeded
imports in October for the first month since February 1995, the
 U.S. Energy Information Administration  said.  Output averaged 7.74 million barrels a day, the Energy
Department’s statistical unit said in its monthly  Short-Term
Energy Outlook . Crude oil net imports were 7.57 million, down
from 7.92 million the previous month.  Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking,
have unlocked supplies in shale formations in  North Dakota ,
 Texas  and other states. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude
benchmark, has dropped to below $95 from above $110 in September
as domestic output reached a 24-year high.  “It’s something we’ve been forecasting since earlier this
year,” said  Tancred Lidderdale , an economist with the EIA in
 Washington  who helped write the report. “Crude-oil production
from shale-oil has been steadily growing over the last few years
and it’s expected to continue to grow.”  For the year, production will reach 7.49 million barrels a
day, the EIA forecast, 20,000 barrels lower than imports. Output
will reach 8.49 million in 2014 as imports drop to 6.54 million.  The EIA lowered its WTI price forecast to $97.74 a barrel
this year from last month’s projection of $98.69. The U.S.
benchmark grade will average $95 in 2014 versus last month’s
estimate of $96.21.  Brent Average  Brent, used to price more than half of world oil trade,
will average $108.01 this year and $103 in 2014, up from October
estimates of $107.96 and $102.21.  Liquid fuel production from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will decline by 800,000 barrels a day to
35.9 million in 2013 and stay near that level in 2014, the EIA
said. The agency reduced its global oil-consumption  forecast  for
this year to 90.25 million barrels a day from 90.26 million
estimated last month. The 2014 forecast is 91.39 million versus
the previous 91.43 million.  Retail gasoline in the U.S. will average $3.50 a gallon
this year, down from last month’s estimate of $3.52. The 2014
forecast is $3.39.  WTI futures gained 84 cents, or 0.9 percent, to end today
at $93.88 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Prices
fell to $93.04 a barrel on Nov. 12, the lowest settlement since
May 31.  “The EIA expects that falling crude  oil prices  and a well-supplied gasoline market will help drive U.S. retail gasoline
prices down further for the remainder of the year,”  Adam
Sieminski , the administrator of the EIA, said in a statement.  Brent futures advanced $1.31, or 1.2 percent, to $107.12 on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Brent’s premium to
WTI widened to $13.24.  The Brent premium will average $10 a barrel during the
fourth quarter and $8 during 2014, the EIA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
