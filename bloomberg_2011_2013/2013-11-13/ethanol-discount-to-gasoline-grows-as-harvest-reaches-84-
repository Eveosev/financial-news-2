Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
expanded as the U.S. corn harvest progressed, increasing
supplies and lowering costs of the raw material used to make the
biofuel.  Gasoline rose more than ethanol, widening the spread by
1.46 cents to 85.9 cents. Corn growers harvested 84 percent of
the crop as of Nov. 10, up from 73 percent a week earlier, the
U.S. Agriculture Department said yesterday. The department
projects a harvest of 13.989 billion bushels, the largest ever.  “You have record crops being harvested or planted
everywhere in the world,” Martinho Ono, chief executive officer
of Sao Paulo-based brokerage SCA Ethanol do Brasil, said in a
telephone interview.  Ethanol advanced 2.7 cents, or 1.5 percent, to  $1.769 a
gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, gaining for a fifth
straight session, the longest winning streak since the seven
days ended May 1. Prices have dropped 19 percent this year.  Gasoline for December delivery climbed 4.16 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.628 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The contract covers reformulated gasoline made to be blended
with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is scheduled to
release a proposal for the use of renewable fuels this month.
The agency may reduce the federal mandate to 15.21 billion
gallons in 2014 from 18.15 billion established by a 2007 law,
according to a draft document dated Aug. 23 provided to
Bloomberg.  EPA Proposal  “I guess prices would have been rising more, if it were
not for the EPA,” Ono said.  Bets that ethanol prices will drop, in futures for four of
the most-traded contracts, outnumbered long contracts by 5.7
percent in the week ended Nov. 5, the most on record, according
to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission compiled
by Bloomberg Industries.  The Energy Information Administration will report its
weekly changes in stockpiles and output tomorrow. Inventories
increased 1.4 percent to 15.2 million barrels in the week ended
Nov. 1, while production declined 1 percent to 902,000 barrels a
day, the EIA said Nov. 6.  Corn for December delivery retreated 2.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $4.2975 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel of the grain
makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Ethanol Certificates  The crush margin rose to 21 cents a gallon from 17 cents
yesterday. The EPA uses Renewable Identification Numbers, or
RINs, tracking certificates attached to each gallon of biofuel
to track compliance with the mandate.  Corn-based RINs decreased 1.5 cents to 20 cents, while
 advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol added 1 cent to 23 cents.  In cash market trading, ethanol climbed 5 cents to $2.25 a
gallon in New York, 9 cents to $1.95 in Chicago, 9 cents to
$2.04 on the  Gulf Coast  and 1.5 cents to $1.975 on the West
Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s discount to the Gulf was 6.5 cents,
compared with a premium of 1 cent yesterday, while Chicago’s
discount to  New York  narrowed 4 cents to 30 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
