The world is heading for its seventh
warmest year on record with temperatures that were unprecedented
two decades ago, the  United Nations  said.  “All of the warmest years have been since 1998, and this
year once again continues the underlying, long-term trend,” UN
World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Michel Jarraud said today in a statement at the United Nations climate
talks in Warsaw. “The coldest years now are warmer than the
hottest years before 1998.”  The global average temperature through September is on a
par with the average for the 2001 through 2010 decade, which was
the warmest ever, according to the WMO. With the main greenhouse
gases at a record in 2012 and set to rise further, Jarraud said
the planet is committed to a warmer future.  Envoys from 195 countries have gathered in the Polish
capital to craft elements of a global agreement to reduce
 greenhouse gases . They aim to adopt the treaty in 2015 and have
it come into force from 2020. Their task is to limit
temperatures to ensure they don’t rise by more than the agreed
UN target of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since
industrialization.  Countries experiencing records include  Australia , with
its hottest month ever registered in January, Japan, which had
its warmest summer, and  China , with its warmest August, the WMO
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
