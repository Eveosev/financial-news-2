The City Council in Desert Hot
Springs,  California , stopped short of declaring a fiscal
emergency despite a warning that it may run out of cash in four
months. City officials kept the option open.  The resort town of 26,000 people and 16 boutique mineral
 spas  will run out of cash by March 31, according to a memo to
the council from Amy Aguer, the interim director of finance and
administration. She recommended declaring the emergency, a step
required under California law if the city decides to seek court
protection from creditors.  A bankruptcy decision by Desert Hot Springs, near  Palm
Springs , about 110 miles (180 kilometers) east of  Los Angeles ,
would make it the third in California, joining San Bernardino,
with a population of 210,000, and Stockton, with 292,000
residents, the biggest U.S. city to enter Chapter 9 proceedings
until Detroit sought protection in July.  While the council took no action today, it may consider
such a move at its next meeting on Nov. 19, said Robert Adams,
the interim city manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
