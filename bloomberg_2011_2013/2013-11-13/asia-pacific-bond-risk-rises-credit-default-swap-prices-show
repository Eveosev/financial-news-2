The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index jumped 3 basis points to
106.5 basis points as of 11:15 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. prices. The benchmark is poised for its
highest close since Oct. 25, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 1 basis point to 140 as of 8:21
a.m. in  Singapore , Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
prices show. The measure, which also advanced the past two days,
is set to close up 10 basis points from Oct. 31, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 90.8
basis points as of 9:15 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The gauge has ranged from 74 to 148.1 this year, CMA data
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
