Hog futures fell for the second
consecutive day on signs that U.S. pork demand is easing. Cattle
prices climbed.  The cash price of hogs for  immediate  delivery through
yesterday was down 20 percent since reaching this year’s high on
June 13, and prices dropped five of the past six days, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show.  “Meatpackers are saying they have enough supply to fill
the plants,” Jason Golly, a vice president of risk management
marketing at Lynch Livestock Inc. in Waucoma,  Iowa , said by
telephone. “Product is sluggish pre-Thanksgiving” because
consumers buy more turkeys.  Hog futures for February settlement declined 0.7 percent to
90.725 cents a pound at 10:29 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices are down 1.6 percent the past two days.  The U.S. Thanksgiving holiday is Nov. 28.  Cattle futures for February delivery added 0.1 percent to
$1.344 a pound on the CME.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement rose 0.4
percent to $1.64825 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
