West Texas Intermediate crude rose
on speculation that increasing refinery profits from making
gasoline and heating oil will bolster use of the raw material.  Futures advanced 0.9 percent as the  margin  to turn crude
into fuel, expressed by the so-called crack spread, climbed to
the highest level since August. Gasoline jumped on forecasts
that a government report tomorrow will show supplies fell for a
fifth week. WTI’s discount to Brent oil widened to the most in
seven months as unrest in Libya disrupted exports.  “Gasoline is leading the way,” said Kyle Cooper, director
of commodities research at IAF Advisors in Houston. “The crack
spread is strong, and that’s pulling WTI higher.”  WTI for December delivery went up 84 cents to settle at
$93.88 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
contract tumbled $2.10 to $93.04 yesterday, the lowest close
since May 31. The volume of all futures traded was 26 percent
higher than the 100-day average at 4:43 p.m.  Prices reduced gains after the American Petroleum Institute
reported inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for WTI futures, rose 1.67 million barrels last week. U.S. total
supply increased 599,000. WTI climbed 62 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $93.66 a barrel at 4:43 p.m. in electronic trading. It was
$93.77 before the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  Gasoline for December delivery advanced 4.16 cents, or 1.6
percent, to settle at $2.628 a gallon in New York. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for December delivery rose 4.45 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.8977 a gallon.  The profit from processing three barrels of crude into two
of gasoline and one of heating oil, based on New York futures
settlement prices, rose 95 cents to $20.27 a barrel, topping $20
for the first time since Aug. 1.  Gasoline Stockpiles  An Energy Information Administration report tomorrow will
show that gasoline inventories fell 900,000 barrels last week,
based on the median of 11 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg
survey. Gasoline supplies slid 9.84 million barrels in the four
weeks ended Nov. 1.  Refineries operated at 87.4  percent  of capacity in the week
ended Nov. 8, up 0.6 percentage point from the prior period, the
survey showed. Refiners scheduled maintenance in September and
October after the end of the peak-gasoline-demand summer months.  “Gasoline is still rising in response to last week’s
inventory report, which is an overreaction,” Cooper said. “As
refineries increase operating rates, you’ll see a lot of reports
that gasoline supplies are rising, while crude supplies drop.”  Crude stockpiles  probably climbed by 800,000 barrels in the
week ended Nov. 8. Supplies surged 8.4 percent to 385.4 million
barrels, the most since June, in the seven weeks ended Nov. 1.  ‘Another Build’  “Tomorrow’s report should show another build in crude
supplies, but not one as extreme as in previous weeks because of
an increase in refinery runs,” said Bob Yawger, director of the
futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York.
“Seasonal maintenance is coming to an end and the gasoline and
heating oil cracks are really strong.”  The EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, is
releasing its data a day later than usual because of the
Veterans Day holiday on Nov. 11.  Brent rose and the spread with WTI widened as demonstrators
at Libya’s Hariga port stopped a tanker from loading. The
African country pumped 250,000 barrels on Nov. 10, said Mohamed
Elharari, a spokesman for state-run National Oil Corp. That’s
down from an average of 1.28 million barrels a day in the first
six months of this year, according to  Bloomberg data .  Iran  and six world powers ended a meeting over the weekend
without coming to an agreement on the nation’s nuclear program.
The U.S. and the European Union tightened sanctions on Iran in
July 2012 to curb its atomic activities.  Separate Markets  “We’re now looking at two separate oil markets that are
moving different factors,” said Rob Haworth, a senior
investment strategist in  Seattle  at U.S. Bank Wealth Management,
which oversees about $112 billion of assets. “Brent is moving
higher because of sanctions against Iran and unrest in Libya,
while WTI has been under pressure because in the U.S. there’s
plenty of inventory and production.”  Brent for December settlement, which expires tomorrow,
increased $1.31, or 1.2 percent, to end the session at $107.12
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The more-active
January contract rose $1.35, or 1.3 percent, to $106.89. Volume
was 25 percent above the 100-day average.  December Brent rose to a $13.24 premium to WTI contract
from the same month, which is up from $12.77 yesterday and the
highest on a closing basis since April 2.  OPEC Meeting  The spread “breached $14 overnight for the first time
since April,” Yawger said. “We’re at a critical level here and
will have to see if the spread widens to $15, something that
hasn’t happened since March.”  Kuwaiti Oil Minister Mustafa Al-Shemali said he expects no
change in the crude production target for the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries when the group’s oil ministers
meet next on Dec. 4 in Vienna.  “I don’t see a lot coming out of the next meeting other
than assertions that members will do what’s necessary to defend
$100 oil,” Haworth said.  The U.S. will surpass  Russia  and Saudi Arabia as the
world’s largest oil producer by 2015, approaching energy self-sufficiency in the next two decades on booming output from shale
formations, the International Energy Agency said yesterday.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
January was 18.4 percent, down from 18.8 percent yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 692,109
contracts as of 4:43 p.m. It totaled 804,101 contracts
yesterday, 40 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.74 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
