YRC Worldwide Inc. (YRCW) , the struggling
trucker seeking crucial union concessions to help refinance
debt, fell the most in two years after reporting a quarterly
loss amid driver shortages and higher costs.  The shares  slid  21 percent to close at $7.72 in New York,
the biggest one-day decline since October 2011.  Chief Executive Officer James Welch said the quarter was
“hindered” by a shortage of drivers in the company’s freight
network, resulting in higher than expected overtime pay and
lower productivity. The results coincide with union talks on a
new labor agreement that is key to refinancing debt and ensuring
the company’s recovery.  The net loss of $44.4 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30
compared with profit of $3 million a year earlier, the Overland
Park, Kansas-based company said in a statement yesterday.
Operating expenses rose 3.1 percent to $1.25 billion.  YRC, which has posted  annual losses  since 2007, has asked
its 26,000 union workers to extend a labor contract and keep
enduring a 15 percent wage cut to help the company survive. The
trucker is currently in talks with the International Brotherhood
of Teamsters.  YRC has almost $1.4 billion in borrowings from what Welch
has called “numerous missteps” before he became CEO in July
2011. The company had about $170 million of cash on hand as of
Sept. 30. YRC has $944 million of bonds and loans that mature in
the next 16 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
