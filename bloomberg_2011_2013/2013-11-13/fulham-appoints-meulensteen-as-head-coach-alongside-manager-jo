Fulham, in the relegation zone of
English soccer’s Premier League, hired former  Manchester United (MANU) 
assistant Rene Meulensteen as head coach alongside manager
 Martin Jol .  Meulensteen worked at United for more than a decade,
including with manager Alex Ferguson between 2007 and last
season, Fulham said today on its website. Jol took over at the
west London team in June 2011 when  Mark Hughes  quit. Meulensteen
joined today and will start “working alongside” Jol
immediately, the team said.  “We’re all delighted to welcome Rene,” Fulham Chief
Executive Officer Alistair Mackintosh said in the statement.
“There was always going to be a battle for Rene’s services and,
with the assistance of our Chairman Shahid Khan, we’ve been able
to bring one of the best coaches in the world to Fulham.”  Fulham is in 18th place of the 20-team division with 10
points after 11 games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
