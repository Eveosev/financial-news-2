North American sports industry
revenue will grow at a compounded annual rate of 4.8 percent to
$67.7 billion by 2017, according to a report by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  PwC, based in  New York , analyzed four key revenue streams -
- gate receipts, media rights, sponsorship and merchandise --
for professional, college, minor league and some individual
sports properties.  Media rights are projected to increase the most, growing at
a compounded annual rate of 7.7 percent to $17.1 billion by 2017.
PwC cites upcoming rights deals for major properties and the
media industry’s ability to make money from new platforms such
as smartphone applications and streaming games over league
websites for the future growth.  “What’s really driving it is the media rights and
sponsorship segment,”  Adam Jones , PwC’s director of sports
advisory services, said in an interview. “In at least the next
five years we are still anticipating the industry’s ability to
leverage new inventory across both of those segments.”  PwC said the 4.8 percent growth will be a significant step
up from the five-year period from 2008 to 2012, which was
affected by the U.S. recession and labor fights that led to
lockouts.  Compounded annual growth for that period was 0.8 percent to
$53.6 billion, Jones said.  Gate revenue, which will remain the largest of the four key
revenue producers, is projected to increase 3.9 percent
compounded annually to $19.1 billion in 2017.  Value-Added  Teams will need to focus on improving value-added amenities
at the stadium, park or arena, the report said. Adoption of
smartphone applications, exclusive content for game attendees,
data analytics and dynamic pricing models will improve
fundamentals and lead to greater revenue.  Sponsorships are projected to increase 6 percent compounded
annually to $17.7 billion in 2017, fueled by new inventory and
category rights resulting from new in-venue spaces and media
platforms, according to the report.  Licensed merchandise sales are forecast to increase the
least, at an annual compounded rate of 1.6 percent to $13.8
billion in 2017. Growth is linked to “sluggish economic
conditions that are expected to hamper consumers’ willingness to
spend,” the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
