Heavy, sour oils on the  Gulf Coast 
weakened relative to the U.S. benchmark as refineries prepared
to receive crude from the north via a new pipeline.  Southern Green Canyon oil weakened by $1.80 to a discount
of $5.50 a barrel less than West  Texas  Intermediate at 4:15
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The grade is a
high-density, high-sulfur crude pumped in the Gulf of Mexico and
delivered by pipeline to Nederland, Texas.  Nederland is near the terminus for  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s
Keystone South pipeline, which will have the capacity to deliver
as much as 700,000 barrels of crude a day to the Gulf Coast from
Cushing,  Oklahoma . The first oil shipments on that pipeline will
begin “within the next few weeks,” Alex Pourbaix, the
company’s vice president for oil pipelines, said on a conference
call Nov. 5.  “Perhaps the weakening is in anticipation of Keystone’s
startup,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston. Refineries “now have an alternative with Mid-Continent oil.”  Mars Blend weakened by $1.40 to a discount of $2.50 a
barrel to WTI. Poseidon crude’s discount widened by $1.30 to
$3.50 a barrel.  Thunder Horse  eased $1.15 to a 10-cent premium.  Light Louisiana Sweet crude lost 90 cents to a premium of
$2.75 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet weakened by $1 to a $2.75
premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
