Soybeans declined, snapping the best
run in five months, on speculation that improved prospects for
crops in South America will further boost global production.
Wheat gained for the first time in eight days.  Soybeans for January delivery lost as much as 0.3 percent
to $13.105 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and were at
$13.12 by 11:02 a.m.  Singapore  time. Futures climbed to a six-week high yesterday, advancing for a fifth session for the
longest such rally since May 23.  World production may be 4 million to 5 million metric tons
larger than previously expected, Oil World said yesterday,
without providing a specific forecast. The Hamburg-based
researcher pegged the 2013-2014 global harvest at 281.3 million
tons on Oct. 22, 5.4 percent larger than a year earlier. The
U.S. Department of Agriculture raised its forecast to a record
283.54 million tons on Nov. 8 from 281.66 million tons.  “There will be abundant supply of soybeans, putting
pressure on prices,” Vanessa Tan, an analyst at Phillip Futures
Pte, said by phone from Singapore today.  Oil World raised its output forecast for  Paraguay  and said
recent rainfall in Argentina means farmers will boost planting.  Wheat for December delivery gained 0.2 percent to $6.4625 a
bushel after capping the longest slump since Sept. 5 yesterday.
Corn for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to $4.33 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
