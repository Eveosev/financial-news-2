Groupe BPCE Chairman Francois Perol
said he has lots of questions for European Central Bank
officials about their looming review of bank assets and that the
“devil is in the details” of the exercise.  “Fundamentally, we’re not worried,” Perol said on the
sidelines of a press conference today in Paris, where the lender
is based. “The quicker this happens the better.”  Executives from  France ’s fourth-largest bank travels to
 Frankfurt  next week as part of consultations ECB President  Mario Draghi  is carrying out about the three-stage examination of
balance sheets that began this month. The central bank wants to
make sure the banks are solid before it takes responsibility for
their supervision next year.  Perol said he wants to know details of what level of bad-loan provisions the ECB will look for and what accounting
methods it will rely upon as part of the study.  “We want as much contact with our new supervisor as
possible,” Perol said. “The initial communication they’ve done
on this has been very professional, they’ve laid out their
subject well.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
