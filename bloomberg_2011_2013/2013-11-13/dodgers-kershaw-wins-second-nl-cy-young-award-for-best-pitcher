Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles
Dodgers won his second National League Cy Young Award in three
seasons after having Major League Baseball’s lowest earned run
average for the third straight year.  Kershaw beat fellow finalists Jose Fernandez of the Miami
Marlins and Adam Wainwright of the St. Louis Cardinals in voting
by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America.  Max Scherzer earlier received the American League’s Cy
Young Award after posting an MLB-high 21 wins for the Detroit
Tigers. He received 28 of the 30 first-place votes.  The last of baseball’s major awards, the Most Valuable
Player in each league, will be given out tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
