Bangladesh  garment factory owners
agreed to a minimum wage of 5,300 taka ($68) a month for
workers, promising to end a labor dispute that has shut
factories in the Ashulia industrial zone on the outskirts of the
capital Dhaka.  A group of owners met Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who
urged them to accept a recommendation made by a government-appointed panel, Atiqul Islam, president of Bangladesh Garment
Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said in a phone
interview from Dhaka.  “We have agreed to the recommendation and I hope labor
unrest will now come to an end,” he said, after the meeting.  BGMEA also reversed an earlier decision to keep about 250
factories shut in the industrial zone, he said. “There is no
point keeping the factories shut as we have agreed to the
recommendation,” Islam said. “We have decided to resume
operations of those factories tomorrow.”  Ashulia factories account for 35 percent of Bangladesh’s
garment output and supply to retailers including  Hennes &
Mauritz AB (HMB)  and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , according to Abdus Salam
Murshedy, president of the Exporters Association of Bangladesh.  Bangladesh has the second-lowest wages in  Asia  after
Myanmar and that cheap labor has spawned a $20 billion garment
industry that supplies global retailers. Labor tensions have
risen in recent months as factory owners and workers have failed
to agree on salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
