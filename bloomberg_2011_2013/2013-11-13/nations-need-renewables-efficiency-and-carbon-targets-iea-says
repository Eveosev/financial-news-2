Maria van der Hoeven, International
Energy Agency Executive Director, comments on nations’ efforts
to transform their energy industries to reduce dependency on
fossil fuels. She commented yesterday in an interview in  London .  The European Union is considering through at least June
whether to extend renewables, carbon dioxide and energy
efficiency targets to 2030 from 2020 and at what levels.  On the need for emissions, renewables and energy-efficiency
targets:  “It’s practically impossible to exclude one of them. You
can see in China the same thing, where there is a fairly strong
policy on renewables, CO2 pricing and they are working on energy
efficiency. Sometimes we have overlapping targets, but sometimes
you need overlapping targets to see that you are developing into
a stable situation.”  On the implementation of carbon markets around the world:  Emissions-permit markets need to be done “in such a way
that countries that are lagging behind are not benefiting more
than countries that are at the forefront of carbon pricing.
That’s why the signals from a huge country like  China  are so
very, very important.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
