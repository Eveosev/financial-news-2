Chinese stocks rose for the third
time in four days in  New York , as  Sina Corp. (SINA)  led rallies among
Internet companies after third-quarter profit beat estimates.  The Bloomberg China-US Index of the most traded Chinese
stocks in the U.S. added 0.6 percent to 101.75 yesterday. Sina,
owner of the Twitter-like Weibo service, and  E-House China
Holdings Ltd. (EJ) , a Shanghai-based property brokerage, both surged
11 percent. Qihoo 360 Technology Co. climbed the most since
August and  Phoenix New Media Ltd. (FENG)  rose to a two-week high.  Net income at Shanghai-based Sina more than doubled to
$25.4 million, beating the $16.2 million average of nine analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sina, in which Alibaba Group
Holding Ltd. bought an 18 percent stake in April, forecast
fourth-quarter sales of as much as $194 million, compared with
an analysts’ mean projection of $183 million. Earnings at E-House also surpassed analyst estimates.  “Sina’s revenue guidance and third-quarter sales both beat
consensus thanks to the increasing contribution from Weibo,”
Echo He, analyst at Maxim Group LLC in New York said by phone.
“People may also expect big advertising revenue growth this
quarter on other Internet ad platforms, such as Qihoo, because
marketing spending from big e-commerce companies like Alibaba is
increasing quickly.”  The  iShares China Large-Cap ETF , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., dropped 1.1 percent to $36.49
in New York in a second day of declines. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index climbed 0.8 percent to a record after Macy’s Inc.
jumped on better-than-estimated earnings and investors weighed
the strength of the economy to assess when the  Federal Reserve 
may scale back stimulus.  Price Upgrades  Sina’s shares surged to $84.55, rallying the most since
January 2012. Trading volume was 4.2 times the 90-day average
compiled by Bloomberg.  The company’s third-quarter gross margin increased to 64
percent from 54 percent in the prior three months, which
represents “significant” improvement, according to Maxim’s He.  At least  five analysts  have raised their price estimates
for Sina after the company’s third-quarter report on Nov. 12.
The average price target of 25 analysts is $92.04, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  E-House’s American depositary receipts jumped to $11.16,
the highest level since May 2011.  The company reported adjusted profit of 20 cents for each
ADR, compared with a 14-cent average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. It also raised its forecast for 2013
revenue by 11 percent to $700 million, according to its
statement yesterday.  Qihoo, a Beijing-based  software developer  which owns
 China ’s most-used web browser, gained 9.8 percent to $89.38,
rallying the most since Aug. 16.  Phoenix New Media’s ADRs advanced 7.2 percent to $10.24,
the highest close since Oct. 25.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index in  Hong Kong  tumbled
2.7 percent to 10,276.61, slumping the most since August, while
the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  sank 1.8 percent to 2,087.94.  To contact the reporter on this story:
