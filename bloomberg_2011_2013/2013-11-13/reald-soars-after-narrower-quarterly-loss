RealD Inc. (RLD) , a provider of 3-D
technology to cinemas, surged the most since its initial public
offering more than three years ago after it reported a narrower
loss than analysts’ estimated.  RealD rose 25 percent to $8.76 at the close in  New York ,
the biggest one-day gain since its IPO in July 2010. The  Beverly
Hills , California-based company had  fallen  38 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 24 percent gain in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The company yesterday reported its loss widened to $4.7
million, or 9 cents a share, in its second fiscal quarter of
2014 which ended Sept. 30., from $4.2 million or 8 cents a share
in the year earlier period. That beat analysts’ estimates for a
loss of 19 cents a share. Sales fell 20 percent to $43.9 million
in the quarter, exceeding analysts’ estimates of $41.6 million.  RealD said earlier this month it plans to eliminate about
20 percent of its workforce as a result of slowing
installations.  Chief Executive Officer  Michael Lewis  said yesterday that
he the popularity of the film “Gravity” shows that “RealD’s
platform can deliver strong results” when all the factors are
in place. He also announced new contracts to install a total of
250 new screens in China and  Russia , two of the fastest growing
cinema markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
