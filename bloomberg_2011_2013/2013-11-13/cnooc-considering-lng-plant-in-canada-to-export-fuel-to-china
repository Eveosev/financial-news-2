Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,  China ’s biggest offshore
oil and gas producer, is considering constructing a liquefied
natural gas plant and export terminal in western  Canada  and
possibly exporting the fuel to China.  The plant may be built at Grassy Point near Prince Rupert
in British Columbia, Cnooc said in a statement today. Cnooc,
through its subsidiary Nexen Energy ULC, signed an agreement to
access the land with the government of British Columbia.  LNG producers are exporting the fuel to Asia as consumers
in the region pay a premium to import the energy source. Japan
paid an average price of $15.74 per million British thermal
units for LNG in July, according to data from LNG Japan Corp.
That compares with an average of about $3.68 for U.S. natural
gas futures traded in New York this year.  “LNG export is the most attractive option for maximizing
the value of our Canadian shale gas business,” Li Fanrong, CEO
of Cnooc, said in the statement.  Cnooc and its state-owned parent China National Offshore
Oil Corp. have LNG facilities in China including in Guangdong,
Shanghai, Fujian, Zhuhai and Ningbo, and plan to build more to
feed China’s increasing appetite for the clean fuel. The cost of
the potential project wasn’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
