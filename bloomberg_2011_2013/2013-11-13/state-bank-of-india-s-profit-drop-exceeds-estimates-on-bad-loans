Shares of  State Bank of India , the
country’s largest lender by assets, rose the most in almost two
weeks after its bad-loan ratio widened less than analysts had
estimated during the second quarter.  The gross ratio of sour debt to total lending widened to
5.64 percent in the three months to Sept. 30 from 5.15 percent a
year earlier, the Mumbai-based bank said in an exchange filing
today.  Net income  in the period fell 35 percent to 23.8 billion
rupees ($375 million) as provisions for defaults rose 44
percent.  “The rise in bad loans was lower than what investors
expected,” Vishal Narnolia, a Mumbai-based analyst at SMC
Global Securities Ltd. said by phone, adding that the market
consensus was for a ratio of more than 6 percent. “The lender
has also pro-actively increased provisions on stressed assets.
Investors are finding comfort in this.”  The lowest profit in nine quarters underscores the
challenges faced by Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, the first
woman to lead the bank, in curbing bad loans and boosting
capital ratios in a slowing economy. The bank will take measures
to bolster earnings by improving the recovery of soured debt,
Bhattacharya said Oct. 8, the day after she took office.  Shares of SBI rose 1.4 percent to 1,697.05 rupees, the
biggest increase since Nov. 1, at the close of Mumbai trading.
The  stock  slumped 29 percent this year, surpassing the S&P BSE
Bankex Index’s 16 percent drop.  More Loans  The  bank’s  net interest income, or revenue from lending
minus payments on deposits, rose 12 percent to 123 billion
rupees. Total outstanding loans rose 19 percent to 11.4 trillion
rupees at the end of September from a year earlier.  Loans at Indian lenders grew 16.7 percent in the 12 months
to Oct. 18, fortnightly central bank  data  show. That compares
with an 18.2 percent expansion in the year to Sept. 6, which was
the fastest pace in 15 months.  Second-quarter earnings fell to 34.7 rupees a share from
54.5 rupees a year earlier, SBI said today. Provisions for bad
loans were 26.5 billion rupees in the period, compared with 18.4
billion rupees a year ago.  The bank’s  profit  growth for the two previous quarters fell
at least 13 percent from the year-earlier periods amid rising
provisions for sour debt, exchange filings showed. SBI will
continue in coming months its “war on bad loans,” which will
fall sustainably only when the country’s economy expands at a
faster pace, Bhattacharya said Oct. 8.  Capital Ratio  India ’s  economy  may grow 4.8 percent in the year through
March 2014, based on a compilation of forecasts from other
organizations, the RBI said in an Oct. 28  report . That would be
the slowest pace since 2003, and compares with a July projection
of a 5.7 percent expansion.  SBI’s capital adequacy ratio, according to the so-called
Basel III rules, stood at 11.69 percent as of Sept. 30, exchange
filings showed.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , India’s largest private lender
by assets, had a capital ratio of 16.5 percent, stock exchange
filings showed.  India’s government will infuse 20 billion rupees into SBI
as part of a 140-billion rupee recapitalization of state-run
banks in the year ending March 31, Rajiv Takru, the  Finance
Ministry ’s banking secretary, said on Oct. 23. The investment
will allow SBI to raise another 17 billion rupees by selling
shares to institutional investors without reducing the
government’s stake, Takru said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
