China  should consider auctioning
quotas for importing agricultural goods to increase transparency
and create a level playing field for all companies, private
research firm Shanghai JC Intelligence Co. said.  The majority of the 15 billion yuan ($2.5 billion) in
permits each year to buy farm product at low  import duties  go to
state-owned companies and a small number of large, private
businesses, the Shanghai-based firm said in a report e-mailed
yesterday. Some profit by reselling the goods rather than using
them as they should under government rules, it said.  Small and medium-sized businesses that can’t obtain quotas
become less competitive and some are forced to pay to acquire
them, Shanghai JC said. Cotton quotas traded for as much as
3,800  yuan  a ton last year, while long-grain rice permits
fetched 220 yuan a ton, it said, citing people in the industry
it didn’t name.  China’s annual quotas include 7.2 million metric tons of
corn, 9.6 million tons of wheat and 894,000 tons for cotton,
according to the website of the National Development and Reform
Commission.  The nation’s Communist Party yesterday completed a four-day
policy meeting at the end of which it issued a communique saying
China would make markets “decisive” in allocating resources,
while the state would remain “dominant” in the economy.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
