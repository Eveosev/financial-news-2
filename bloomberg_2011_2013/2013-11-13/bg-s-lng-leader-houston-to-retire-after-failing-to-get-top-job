BG Group Plc (BG/)  Chief Operating Officer
Martin Houston, who led the company’s liquefied natural gas
business, will retire after failing to get the top job.  Houston , 55, who lost out to Chris Finlayson in the race to
become chief executive officer last year, has stepped down from
the board of directors and executive committee, BG said today in
a statement. He will be replaced by  Sami Iskander  as COO, who
joined the company in 2008.  Houston “was one of the principal architects of the
group’s LNG and shipping business during the formative years,”
BG Chairman Andrew Gould said in the statement.  Houston spent more than 30 years with the company, which
became BG when the exploration and production arm of the U.K.’s
former state gas monopoly was split from British Gas Plc in
1997. He will continue to advise on the start of LNG production
at  Australia ’s Queensland Curtis Island plant until the end of
next year, the Reading, England-based company said.  BG shares fell as much as 4.1 percent to 1,217 pence in
 London  and were down 1.4 percent at 11:40 a.m. local time.  BG is set to become the world’s largest seller of LNG in
2017, almost doubling the amount of fuel it sells to about 20
million tons a year. The business is expected to generate as
much as $2.7 billion in operating profit this year.  Finlayson succeeded  Frank Chapman , the former CEO who
transformed the company into a global producer, at the start of
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
