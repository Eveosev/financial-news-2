Barclays Plc (BARC) , the second-biggest
U.K. lender by assets, priced $2 billion of its first junior
bonds that meet new regulations on bank capital.  The lender sold undated, contingent convertible bonds that
will turn into equity if its  Tier 1 capital ratio  falls below 7
percent of risk-weighted assets, according to a person familiar
with the matter, who asked not to be identified because they’re
not authorized to speak about it. The notes, which pay 8.25
percent, are the first from a U.K. bank and the fourth issue in
 Europe .  Banks are remaking their capital structures to include a
series of buffers that can be used to cushion against losses,
restore the issuer as a going concern, or fund its winding up,
all without calling on taxpayers. The notes from London-based
Barclays may herald a wave of issuance, independent research
firm CreditSights Inc. said in a Nov. 11 report.  “A coupon above 8 percent is the important thing,” said
Daniel Bjork, who runs the $145 million Swisscanto Bond Invest
CoCo fund. “Two billion dollars looks on the high side.”  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, the second-largest
Spanish bank, issued the first so-called additional Tier 1 note
in May this year, paying a 9 percent coupon on a $1.5 billion
deal. It was followed by  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  with a $1.25
billion note paying 8.25 percent, and  Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP) ,
which raised 500 million euros ($672 million) paying 11.5
percent. Popular’s was the first additional Tier 1 transaction
in the single currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
