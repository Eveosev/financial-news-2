The odds of  Scotland  becoming
independent are now at their longest ever after a 50,000-pound
($79,620) bet was placed in Edinburgh on voters in the country
opting to remain in the U.K. in next year’s referendum.  Bookmaker  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  said yesterday it revised its odds
on a “No” vote to 1-8 from 1-7, meaning a customer would get
one pound for every 8 pounds staked. Someone in the Edinburgh
area placed a 200,000-pound bet against independence earlier
this year, Ladbrokes spokesman Alex Donohue said.  “We’ve never known ‘Yes’ odds as big as this,” Donohue
said in an e-mailed statement. “We’ve taken some serious cash
on a ‘No’ outcome, again suggesting confidence in the referendum
failing is at an all-time high.”  Scottish First Minister  Alex Salmond  and his  Scottish
National Party , which runs the semi-autonomous government in
Edinburgh, have scheduled the referendum for Sept. 18, 2014. A
poll published last week showed support for independence
trailing that for the status quo by 18 percentage points.  William Hill Plc (WMH) , which is offering the same odds as
Ladbrokes, took three bets in June totaling 200,000 pounds from
a man in Glasgow that voters will reject independence, spokesman
Rupert Adams said by telephone yesterday. The man, who was in
his late 50s and had a pronounced Scottish accent, will win
36,666 pounds if voters reject independence, Adams said.  Both bookmakers, the largest in Britain, are offering odds
of 5-1 that Scotland will leave the U.K.  About 70 percent of bets taken on the vote have gone on a
“No” outcome with 30 percent on a “Yes,” Donohue at
Ladbrokes said. At William Hill, 45 percent of wagers are for
“Yes” with the remainder on a “No” result, Adams said.  The referendum is the biggest betting event in Scottish
political history, with bookmakers anticipating stakes of more
than 2 million pounds by the time the nation goes to the polls
next year, Ladbrokes said. William Hill has so far taken bets of
more than 300,000 pounds, Adams said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
