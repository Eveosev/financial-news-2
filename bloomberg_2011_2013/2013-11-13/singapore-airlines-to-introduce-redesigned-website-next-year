Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) , Southeast
Asia’s biggest carrier, plans to introduce a redesigned website
in 2014, more than two years after a revamp led to glitches and
prompted an apology from the carrier.  The airline will make the website more intuitive and easier
for users, Chief Executive Officer Goh Choon Phong said in
Singapore today.  Singapore Air, famous for its Singapore Girl
advertisements, unveiled a redesigned website in May 2011 and
travelers complained about difficulty booking tickets and
accessing other online services. Goh, who took over that year,
later apologized to customers in an e-mail.  “Be assured what happened then won’t happen again,” Goh
said.  “We learned our lesson very well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
