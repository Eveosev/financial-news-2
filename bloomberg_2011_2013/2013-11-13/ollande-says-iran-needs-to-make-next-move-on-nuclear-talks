French President  Francois Hollande ,
who had a telephone conversation with President  Barack Obama 
today, said it’s up to Iran to give a “positive response”
after talks on halting the Persian country’s nuclear program.  Obama and Hollande “expressed their determination to
obtain a guarantee from Iran that it will permanently give up
its military nuclear program,” Hollande’s office said in an e-mailed statement.  The two heads of state believe the offer made to Iran Nov.
9 is “serious, solid and credible,” the statement said. “It’s
now up to Iran to respond positively.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
