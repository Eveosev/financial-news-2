Euro-area industrial output declined
more than economists forecast in September, led by Germany, as
the currency bloc’s economic recovery struggled to gain
momentum.  Factory production  in the 17-nation region fell 0.5 percent
from August, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said today. That exceeded the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 32 economists for a 0.3 percent drop.
From the year-earlier month, September output rose 1.1 percent.  Euro-area economic growth probably slowed to 0.1 percent in
the third quarter from 0.3 percent in the previous three months,
according to a separate  Bloomberg News survey . Eurostat
publishes its first estimate of third-quarter gross domestic
product tomorrow.  The European Central Bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark
interest to a record low 0.25 percent last week in a bid to
prevent slowing inflation from taking hold in a still-fragile
euro-area economy.  “Looking ahead, output is expected to continue to recover
at a slow pace, in particular owing to a gradual improvement in
domestic demand supported by the accommodative monetary-policy
stance,” ECB President Mario Draghi said on Nov. 7. “Euro-area
economic activity should, in addition, benefit from a gradual
strengthening of demand for exports.”  Industrial production in  Germany , the euro area’s largest
economy, fell 0.8 percent from August, according to today’s
report. French output dropped 0.4 percent, while Italian and
Spanish production increased 0.2 percent and 0.4 percent,
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
