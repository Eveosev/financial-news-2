CaixaBank SA (CABK)  and  Bankia (BKIA)  SA may sell
their stake in Grupo Antolin-Irausa SA to the family that
controls the closely-held car components maker, according to
three people with knowledge of the matter.  The family thatâ€™s the biggest shareholder in the Burgos,
Spain-based company is considering buying the 22.9 percent stake
owned by Anira Inversiones SL, a vehicle 80 percent held by
Bankia and CaixaBank, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the talks are private. Spokespeople for
Antolin, Bankia and CaixaBank declined to comment.  Spanish lenders are selling non-core assets as they seek to
bolster capital, while Bankia is being pushed to divest as a
condition for the European bailout it received last year.  Antolin, which does business in 25 countries, reported
sales last year of more than 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion). It
supplies parts for cars made by Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor
Corp., providing components for a quarter of all vehicles
manufactured worldwide, according to its annual report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
