Loblaw Cos. (L)  and  Metro Inc. (MRU) , Canada’s
largest and third-largest grocers, tumbled after reporting
quarterly profit dropped amid increased competition.  Loblaw fell 7.5 percent to C$44.24 at 4 p.m. in Toronto,
the most since Nov. 15, 2007, after saying profit for the year
will be unchanged from 2012. Metro declined 5.7 percent to C$62,
the most since Nov. 21, 2008.  Canadian grocers are under pressure as bigger U.S. rivals
such as  Target Corp. (TGT)  and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  expand grocery
options in the country.  Brampton, Ontario-based Loblaw said it made “greater than
anticipated investments” in targeted food categories due to
increased competition in the third quarter.  “The company remains committed to its strategy to drive
its customer proposition, including investments in food margins,
in the fourth quarter,” Loblaw said today in a statement. “As
a result, the company expects adjusted operating income and
operating income for the full year to be flat compared to
2012.”  Loblaw’s same-store sales rose 0.4 percent in the third
quarter compared to the year-earlier period, the company said.
The sales were hurt by the timing of the Canadian Thanksgiving
holiday. Profit fell 29 percent to C$154 million ($147 million),
or 54 cents a share, from C$217 million, or 75 cents, a year
earlier, the grocer said in its financial  statement .  ‘Intense Competition’  Metro’s same-store sales slid 1.8 percent in the fiscal
fourth quarter ended Sept. 28, the Montreal-based grocer said
today in a statement. Profit earnings dropped 42 percent to
C$83.6 million, or 88 cents a share, from C$145.1 million, or
C$1.46, a year earlier.  Sales “were impacted by intense competition, especially in
Ontario, resulting from an increase in competitive square
footage that exceeded market growth,” Chief Executive Officer
Eric R. La Fleche said in today’s statement.  Sobeys Inc., a unit of Empire Co., is  Canada ’s second-largest grocer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
