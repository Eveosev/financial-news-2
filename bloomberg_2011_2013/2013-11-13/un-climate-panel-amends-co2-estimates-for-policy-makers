A United Nations climate panel that
was criticized after a 2007 study overstated the rate of glacial
melting backtracked on global carbon-emissions estimates.  The UN Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change  cut its
estimate of total emissions since 1870 to 515 billion metric
tons, or 515 gigatons, from 531 gigatons, according to a
 document  released this week. It raised its calculation of total
carbon emissions since 1750 to 555 gigatons from 545 gigatons.  The Summary for Policy Makers document is designed to guide
envoys from 195 nations as they devise a climate agreement by
2015 to limit emissions after 2020. Since some figures were
revised up and others down, nations have less or more leeway to
emit in the future depending on the scenario.  “Errors can always occur in a human endeavor even if you
do a very thorough revision,” Thomas Stocker, co-chairman of
the group that drafted the report, said today in Warsaw, where
climate envoys are gathered for two weeks of talks. “Addressing
these errors expeditiously and transparently adds to the
credibility of the process.”  The UN panel came under scrutiny following its last major
report in 2007, which exaggerated the rate of melting of
glaciers in the Himalayas and overstated the risk of floods in
the Netherlands. Since then, the panel has changed the way it
deals with errors.  Warming Target  The Summary for Policy Makers document was released in
draft form on Sept. 27 and was then subject to editing. The
revisions are included in the final version and will inform
climate envoys working toward a new treaty to ensure global
temperatures don’t rise by more than the UN target of 2 degrees
Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) since industrialization.  The original report also provided the total  carbon
emissions  permissible under various scenarios. Releasing 900
gigatons would give the world a 33 percent chance of meeting the
2-degree goal, the panel said in the latest document, raising
its estimate from 880 gigatons.  Emissions must be kept to 820 gigatons for a 50 percent
chance of meeting the target, and 790 gigatons for a 66 percent
chance, it said, reducing both figures from previous estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
