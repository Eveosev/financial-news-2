India ’s 10-year government bond
yield rose to the highest level in 12 weeks and the rupee fell
to a two-month low after a report showed inflation accelerated
last month by more than economists predicted.  Consumer prices  climbed 10.09 percent from a year earlier,
after a 9.84 percent increase in September, official data showed
after the market shut yesterday. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey was for a 9.9 percent gain.  Industrial
production (INPIINDY)  grew 2 percent in September, another report showed,
compared with a 3.5 percent rise predicted in a separate survey.  “CPI inflation has once more crossed the psychological
double digit,”  Indranil Pan , an economist at Kotak Mahindra
Bank Ltd. in Mumbai, wrote in a research report today. “This
leaves the Reserve Bank of India with little option but to focus
on inflation containment despite a continuing growth slump.”  The yield on the 7.16 percent notes due May 2023 rose five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 9.11 percent as of
9:53 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from the central bank’s
trading system. The rate climbed as high as 9.15 percent
earlier, the highest level since Aug. 19.  The rupee fell 0.1 percent to 63.73 per dollar, according
to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
63.91 earlier, the weakest level since Sept. 13, before paring
losses on speculation the central bank intervened. The RBI
probably sold dollars to prevent the currency from dropping
beyond 64, according to two traders, who asked not to be named
as the information isn’t public.  WPI Report  Wholesale price inflation  probably accelerated 6.95 percent
in October from 6.46 percent in September, according to the
median of 40 estimates in a Bloomberg survey before data due
tomorrow.  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
climbed 22 basis points to 14.16 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards rose 0.1 percent to
65.21 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts declined 0.1 percent to 65.73. Forwards
