VimpelCom (VIP)  Ltd., the wireless carrier
controlled by Russian billionaire  Mikhail Fridman , sank to a
four-week low in New York as an unexpected decline in third-quarter revenue spurred concern the company will post its
slowest sales growth on record this year.  VimpelCom fell 3.1 percent to $12.73 in New York yesterday,
the lowest level since Oct. 15, trimming its gain this year to
30 percent. The stock is trading at 10.8 times estimated
earnings, the lowest multiple in a week. The Bloomberg Russia-US
Equity Index of the most-traded Russian companies in the U.S.
slipped to the lowest level since Oct. 3 and RTS stock  futures 
declined in U.S. hours.  Sales at VimpelCom, which replaced Dell Inc. on the
Nasdaq-100 index last month, will rise 0.9 percent in 2013 after
jumping 14 percent in 2012, according to the mean estimate of 16
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The company reported an
unexpected drop in third-quarter earnings on Nov. 6. Citigroup
Inc., VTB Group, UFS Finance Investment Company and Raiffeisen
Bank International cut their buy ratings this month.  “Third-quarter earnings disappointed, casting doubts over
all-year performance,” Sergey Libin, analyst at Raiffeisenbank
AG in Moscow, who cut his buy rating to hold yesterday, said by
phone. “The  market sentiment  is deteriorating because of weak
financials last quarter, and more analysts may still cut their
recommendations on the stock.”  A total of 14 analysts of 25 covering VimpelCom have a  hold
recommendation  on it, the highest total since May, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Two recommend selling it and nine have a buy
rating. Otkritie Financial Corp. increased the stock to a buy on
Nov. 11.  ‘Unfair’ Premium  VimpelCom, with 219 million customers worldwide, has slid
11 percent since Nov. 6, when analysts started to lower their
recommendations on the stock as third-quarter net income shrank
by half to $275 million. It traded at a 13.7 percent premium to
OAO Mobile TeleSystems,  Russia ’s biggest mobile phone company,
known as MTS, yesterday. The premium had reached a record high
of 14.2 percent on Nov. 5.  “VimpelCom trading at a premium to MTS doesn’t seem fair
at all and the gap should be gone in about two months from
now,” Anna Milostnova, analyst at UFS-Finance Investment Co. in
Moscow, said by phone yesterday. She cut VimpelCom to hold from
buy Nov. 8 and has a hold rating on MTS.  MTS fell 1.5 percent to a two-month low of $21.67 in New
York yesterday, reducing its 2013 advance to 16 percent.  While VimpelCom’s adjusted net income is expected to
increase 15 percent in 2013, according to the mean estimate of
16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, MTS’s profit is projected to
surge 36 percent. MTS reports third-quarter results on Nov. 19.  RusHydro Discount  A weaker ruble means lower profits when companies
denominate earnings in dollars, said analysts, including UFS-Finance’s Milostnova. The ruble has depreciated 7.2 percent
against the dollar this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.-traded
exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, slipped 0.1
percent to $28.34, the lowest level since Sept. 30. The RTS
Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the index
 futures (VEA) , added 1 percent to 24.03 in U.S. hours. Futures on the
dollar-denominated RTS Index slid 0.8 percent to 142,630.  The Bloomberg Russia-US gauge decreased 0.9 percent to
99.15.  OAO RusHydro (RSHYY)  fell 3 percent to $1.61 yesterday, settling
at a 4.1 percent discount to the company’s Moscow-listed shares,
the deepest gap this month. OAO Sberbank, the country’s biggest
lender, rose 1.8 percent to $12.61 in New York yesterday.  United Co. Rusal, a Moscow-based aluminum producer, dropped
to a record low, losing 0.9 percent to HK$2.23 in Hong Kong
trading as of 10:33 a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index
fell 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
