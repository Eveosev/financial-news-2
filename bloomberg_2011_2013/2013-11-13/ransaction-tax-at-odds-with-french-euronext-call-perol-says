Groupe BPCE Chairman Francois Perol
said he sees a contradiction between French Finance Minister
Pierre Moscovici’s call for support for the Paris stock exchange
and Europe’s planned financial transaction tax.  Moscovici today urged the Paris financial community to
defend its collective interest as  IntercontinetnalExchange Inc. (ICE) 
prepares to buy  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  and spin off its European equity-trading business.  President Francois Hollande, who called finance his
“greatest adversary” before he won office last year and has
since enacted a tax on share trading, has struggled to rally
backing from French banks. Moscovici said today that everyone
who uses the Paris stock exchange needs to “pull together” and
that the new Euronext will need a “core” group of
shareholders.  Perol said that he understands that view, although he can’t
see a reason to back the project with a potential European
transaction tax undermining it.  “I find it bizarre to be promoting a transaction tax while
at the same time extolling the importance of Euronext,” Perol
said on the sidelines of a press conference today in Paris. “I
understand the importance of maintaining Paris as a financial
center but the government needs a coherent policy.”  Perol, a former advisor to Hollande’s predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy, said the government hasn’t sought to consult him on the
matter and he hasn’t studied the file closely.  To contact the reporters on this story:
