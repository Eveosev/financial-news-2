JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s fourth-quarter trading revenue will be slightly down from last year,
according to Michael Cavanagh, who co-runs the bank’s corporate
and investment bank.  “Fixed income and equities are tracking very well versus
client volumes, which are down slightly” from last year,
Cavanagh said at an investor conference in New York today.  Investment-banking fees for underwriting bond and equity
issuance and advising on mergers and acquisitions are
“healthy” this quarter and may be close to the previous three
months, when JPMorgan generated $1.5 billion in fees, he said.  “Last year’s fourth quarter was a particularly strong
underwriting quarter. I don’t think we’ll achieve that again,
but it’s a healthy quarter,” Cavanagh said, adding that the
final figure “might come in looking something similar to the
third quarter.”  Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto run the corporate and investment
bank, whose traders compiled a perfect record in the first nine
months of this year by generating profits every day the markets
were open. On three of those days, traders made more than $200
million, JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing this month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
