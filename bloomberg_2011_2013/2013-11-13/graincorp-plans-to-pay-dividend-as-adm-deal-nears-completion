GrainCorp Ltd. (GNC) , the Australian crop
handler that agreed to be bought for A$2.2 billion ($2.1
billion) by  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM) , expects to pay a 55 cent
dividend before the deal becomes unconditional.  Shareholders will receive a dividend of 20 cents a share
next month bringing the full-year payout so far to 45 cents and
a further payment is expected to “be declared and announced by
the GrainCorp board shortly before the ADM offer becomes
unconditional,” the Sydney-based company said today when
reporting a 31 percent drop in annual earnings. Under the terms
of the deal, a total of A$1 in dividends can be paid.  ADM is seeking to conclude a deal to acquire GrainCorp for
A$12.20 a share in the first three months of 2014. The
transaction is subject to approval from  Australia ’s Foreign
Investment Review Board and China’s Ministry of Commerce as it
will give ADM control over seven of the eight ports that ship
grain in bulk from the Pacific nation’s east coast.  Australia, the world’s third-largest shipper of wheat and
beef, and the largest wool exporter, would lose out under the
sale by relinquishing control of its  food security , Deputy Prime
Minister Warren Truss said Nov. 3.  GrainCorp was little changed at A$12.22 at 10:05 a.m. in
Sydney.  Treasurer  Joe Hockey , who will make a decision on approving
the deal by Dec. 17, said this month he wouldn’t be pressured by
opposition to a foreign acquisition of GrainCorp.  Net income fell 31 percent to A$140.9 million in the 12
months to Sept. 30, from A$205 million a year ago, missing a
A$159.4 million median estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Earnings fell as receivals declined on lower grain
production in eastern Australia and as a result of costs of A$18
million responding to Decatur, Illinois-based ADM’s proposal,
GrainCorp said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
