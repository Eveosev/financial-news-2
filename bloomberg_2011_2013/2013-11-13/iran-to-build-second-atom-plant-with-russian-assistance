Iran , which plans to have enough
nuclear reactors to generate 20,000 megawatts of electricity,
hopes the construction of another Russian-built power plant can
start after March, said the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy
Organization.  “We hope to witness the construction of our country’s
second nuclear power plant in the beginning of the new Iranian
year,”  Ali Akbar Salehi  was quoted as saying by the state-run
 Iranian Students News Agency . The new year starts on March 21.  Salehi said the plant would have the capacity to generate
as much as 4,000 megawatts and cited Russia’s “readiness” to
be involved.  The Russian-built 1,000-megawatt reactor located in Bushehr
province is Iran’s first and only functioning nuclear power
plant. Iranian officials say they plan to generate 20 times as
much nuclear power to accommodate their growing population of 77
million. In August, Salehi said his nation was to sign a
memorandum of understanding with Russia to build a second power
plant.  Sergei Novikov , Russian state nuclear company Rosatom
Corp.’s spokesman in Moscow, declined to comment when asked
about today’s announcement.  Iran is meanwhile talking to  Russia , the U.S., the U.K.,
 France , China and Germany over its nuclear program, which the
U.S. administration and its allies say could have a military
dimension. The previous round of nuclear talks ended in Geneva
on Nov. 9 without an initial agreement. Another round of
negotiations is scheduled in the Swiss city for Nov. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
