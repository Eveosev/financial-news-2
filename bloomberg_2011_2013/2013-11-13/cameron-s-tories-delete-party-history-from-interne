U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
Conservatives deleted news articles and speeches from before the
party took office in 2010 from their  website  and from Internet
archives and search engines.  Voters looking to check Cameron’s 2009 pledge not to
reorganize the National Health Service, as he did in office, or
 George Osborne ’s 2007 announcement as Tory Treasury spokesman
that he wanted to match the then Labour government’s spending
plans, which he later denounced, found today that the speeches
had disappeared from the Conservative website.  According to  Computer Weekly magazine , lines of code
inserted into the party site told search engines and the
Internet archive that they were no longer allowed to keep a
record of the content from before the party took office. The
 Conservative Party  didn’t dispute the article.  “We’re making sure our website keeps the Conservative
Party at the forefront of political campaigning,” the party
said in an e-mailed statement. “These changes allow people to
quickly and easily access the most important information we
provide.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
