AECI Ltd. (AFE) , set for its best share
price performance this year in almost two decades, is benefiting
from a shift away from its reliance on South Africa’s  mining
industry , said Chief Executive Officer Mark Dytor.  AECI is banking on higher-margin products offsetting a
South African mining industry that’s being challenged by labor
unrest, a slump in commodity prices, and rising production
costs. AECI is cutting staff, mechanizing plants and offering
more efficient explosives to miners. The African mining industry
will be worth about $1.57 billion in explosives sales in the
five years through 2017, with gold and coal production
accounting for 54 percent.  “AECI is now positioning itself to focus on core
businesses” comprising of mining and specialties such as water
treatment chemicals and food additives, Dytor said. “We are
getting more shareholder interest.”  AECI  shares  have surged 51 percent this year, valuing the
company at 15.4 billion rand ($1.49 billion), compared with a 14
percent gain in the 165-member FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index.
The 20-member FTSE/JSE Africa Mining Index fell 7.1 percent in
the same period, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The stock
gained 67 percent in 1994.  The Johannesburg-based company sold 1,600 hectares (3,956
acres) of land and buildings to Hong Long-listed  Shanghai Zendai
Property Ltd. (755)  for 1.06 billion rand, according to a Nov. 4
filing. It also plans to sell 720 hectares of land near  Cape
Town , the CEO said.  Proceeds from land sales should be available by July, and
spending the money will “be a matter for discussion by the full
AECI board,” he said.  Focusing on the mining and chemical industries is opening
avenues for the company to expand into other emerging market
countries and in other African countries.  “AECI has a pipeline of five to six acquisition targets in
Africa and  South Africa ,” said Dytor, with each valued at
between 500 million rand to 1 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
