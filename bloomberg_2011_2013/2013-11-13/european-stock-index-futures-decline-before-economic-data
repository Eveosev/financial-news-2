European stocks  fell, posting the
biggest two-day drop in a month, as investors weighed corporate
earnings and speculated stronger economic data will spur central
banks to pare stimulus measures.  Stada Arzneimittel AG and Banco Popolare SC declined at
least 5.5 percent after reporting profit that missed estimates.
ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG slumped to a five-week low after its
largest shareholder sold an almost 16 percent stake. ICAP Plc
advanced 4.1 percent after saying cost cuts will boost results
this year.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index declined 0.6 percent to 319.82
at the close of trading. The gauge rallied for the past five
weeks as the  European Central Bank  lowered its key  interest rate 
and the  Federal Reserve  maintained bond purchases.  “We’re near the end of the earnings season and it was half
light, half shadows,” Andreas Lipkow, a senior market
strategist at Kliegel & Hafner AG in Berlin, said by telephone.
“In the next few days, jobless claims and manufacturing data
out of the U.S. will give more information about the Fed’s
plans. Everybody is guessing when tapering will begin and the
market is nervous about this.”  National benchmark indexes fell in 15 of the 18 western
European markets.  France ’s CAC 40 lost 0.6 percent and  Germany ’s
DAX slid 0.2 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 slid 1.4 percent, its
biggest retreat in almost three months.  Fed Policy  Investors will watch U.S. economic reports this week on
first-time claims for  unemployment benefits  and manufacturing in
the  New York  area for clues on when the Fed will reduce the pace
of its stimulus. The central bank may delay a decision until
March, when it may pare monthly bond purchases to $70 billion
from $85 billion, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey on Nov. 8. The Fed next meets Dec. 17-18.  The  Bank of England  today brought forward the likely date
for the U.K.’s unemployment rate to fall to 7 percent to the
third quarter of 2015. That level is the trigger when the
central bank may consider raising its benchmark interest rate.  The U.K.’s  Office for National Statistics  said the jobless
rate as measured by the International Labour Organisation
standards declined to 7.6 percent, the lowest since 2009, in the
third quarter.  Stada Arzneimittel dropped 5.5 percent to 37.88 euros for
the biggest decline in more than a year. The drugmaker posted
nine-month adjusted net income of 100.3 million euros ($135
million), missing analysts’ projection for 105 million euros.  Bank Shares  Banco Popolare slid 6.1 percent to 1.34 euros. The Italian
lender reported third-quarter net income of 9.26 million euros,
missing analysts’ estimate of 47.5 million euros.  A gauge of bank shares fell 1.2 percent, for the third-biggest decline among the  19 industry groups  in the Stoxx 600.
Standard Chartered Plc lost 2.5 percent to 1,448 pence after
Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. advised investors to sell the
shares. UniCredit SpA dropped 4.5 percent to 5.21 euros.
Commerzbank AG decreased 2.4 percent to 10.09 euros.  ProSiebenSat.1 tumbled 4 percent to 32.09 euros after its
largest shareholder cut its stake for the second time this year.
A holding firm controlled by funds of KKR & Co. and Permira
Advisers LLP sold 35 million shares for about 1.1 billion euros
at 31.53 euros apiece. The private-equity firms had acquired
ProSiebenSat.1 in 2006 and tried to sell the broadcaster earlier
this year. After failing to find a buyer, they started selling
the shares in the market.  Mediaset SpA tumbled 7.5 percent to 3.50 euros for the
biggest drop in eight months. The broadcaster posted a third-quarter net loss of 57.4 million euros.  ICAP jumped 4.1 percent to 391.8 pence. The world’s largest
broker of transactions between banks predicted pretax profit
before exceptional items for the 12 months through March 2014
will be “marginally ahead of the prior year.”  Drax Group Plc (DRX)  rose 2.6 percent to 653 pence. The operator
of the U.K.’s biggest coal-fired power station forecast 2013
adjusted profit and earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization will beat analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
