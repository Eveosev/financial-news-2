West Texas Intermediate was little
changed after closing at the lowest price in more than five
months before data that’s forecast to show U.S. crude
inventories rose to the highest level since June.  Futures fell 2.2 percent yesterday in  New York . Global oil
markets are well-supplied, according to the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Crude stockpiles  in the U.S., the
world’s biggest oil user, probably gained for an eighth week, a
Bloomberg News survey shows before a report the Energy
Information Administration expects to release tomorrow.  The market is “looking for the inventories to rise
again,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S
in Copenhagen, said by phone. Prices may be reaching a low after
a “dramatic selloff” that started in August, he said.  WTI for December delivery was at $93.29 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , up 25
cents, at 9:37 a.m. London time. The contract slid $2.10 to
$93.04 yesterday, the lowest since May 31. The volume of all
futures traded was about 1 percent below the 100-day average.  Brent for December settlement, which expires tomorrow,
gained 66 cents to $106.47 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The January contract traded 61 cents
higher at $106.15. Front-month futures were at a premium of
$13.20 to WTI compared with yesterday’s level of $12.77, which
was the most based on closing prices since Oct. 30.  Fuel Supplies  U.S.  crude stockpiles  probably climbed by 800,000 barrels
to 386.2 million in the week ended Nov. 8, according to the
median estimate of 11 analysts in the survey. The EIA, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm, is releasing its data a day
later than usual because of the Veterans Day holiday on Nov. 11.  “The market is pre-empting another build-up of U.S. crude
inventories,” said Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at CMC
Markets in Sydney who predicts WTI has “minor” technical
support at $91.26 a barrel. “More of it’s being produced, and
not enough of it is being consumed.”  Gasoline inventories  declined by 900,000 barrels, the
survey shows. Distillate supplies, including heating oil and
diesel, are expected to have decreased by 1 million.  The U.S. will surpass  Russia  and  Saudi Arabia  as the
world’s largest oil producer by 2015, approaching energy self-sufficiency in the next two decades amid booming output from
shale formations, the  International Energy Agency  said in its
annual World Energy Outlook yesterday.  Oil Demand  OPEC said separately in its monthly Oil Market Report
yesterday that global oil demand will expand by 1.04 million
barrels a day, or 1.2 percent, to 90.82 million in 2014,
maintaining the group’s previous estimate before a policy
meeting in December.  Crude and refined-product inventories in industrialized
nations equated to 58 days of consumption in the third quarter,
compared with an average of 52.1 days from 2003 to 2007,
according to the producer group.  OPEC’s 12 members pumped 29.89 million barrels a day in
October, little changed from September, the group said, citing
data from secondary sources. That’s about 300,000 a day more
than the average output OPEC estimates markets will need next
year, and 100,000 a day less than the group’s formal target.  To contact the reporters on this story:
