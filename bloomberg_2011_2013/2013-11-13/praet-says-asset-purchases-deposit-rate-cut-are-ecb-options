The European Central Bank will
consider all options to ensure price stability and asset
purchases are a potential option if needed, Executive Board
member Peter Praet said.  “If our mandate is at risk we are going to take all the
measures that we think we should take to fulfill that mandate,”
Peter Praet, who heads the ECB’s economics department, said in
an interview with the Wall Street Journal published today.
“That’s a very clear signal.”  The Frankfurt-based ECB lowered its  benchmark interest rate 
to a record low of 0.25 percent last week after euro area
inflation cooled to less than half of its target level of just
under 2 percent. With the central bank now so close to zero,
policy makers must consider what to do if the cut fails to keep
 price growth  from slowing further.  Praet signaled that even though additional stimulus isn’t
needed now, asset purchases could be deployed.  “The balance-sheet capacity of the central bank could also
be used,” he said in the interview, adding that more action can
still be taken on interest rates.  “On standard measures, interest rates, we still have room
and that would also include the deposit rate,” Praet was cited
as saying. With the deposit rate already at zero, that implies
the ECB could begin to charge banks to deposit cash with it.
Further rounds of long-term loans to banks could also be made,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
