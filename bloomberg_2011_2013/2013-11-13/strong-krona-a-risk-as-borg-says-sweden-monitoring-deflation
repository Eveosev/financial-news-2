Swedish Finance Minister  Anders Borg 
said policy makers need to monitor a drop in consumer prices
brought on by a strong krona that he says is a “risk” to the
economy.  Sweden  needs to take “dangerous” deflation “seriously”
and monitor price developments “carefully,” Borg told
reporters in  Stockholm  today.  The krona plunged yesterday to its lowest against the euro
since June 2012 after a report showed  consumer prices dropped  in
October, when most economists and the central bank had seen a
rise. The development underscores a dilemma at the central bank,
where policy makers have struggled to bring inflation closer to
a 2 percent target without fueling an overheated housing market
and record private debt.  The Riksbank in October kept its repo rate at 1 percent and
signaled tightening won’t start until late next year. Two of the
bank’s six board members have been arguing that rates should be
cut again to help reach the inflation target.  According to SEB AB, Sweden’s central bank will have no
choice but to cut its main rate to 0.75 percent next month as it
misses its inflation goal. The  European Central Bank  last week
lowered its main rate to 0.25 percent as policy makers in the
euro area struggle with disinflation.  Sweden’s krona eased 0.2 percent to 8.9517 as of 9:38 a.m.
in Stockholm, its weakest against the euro since June 11, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
