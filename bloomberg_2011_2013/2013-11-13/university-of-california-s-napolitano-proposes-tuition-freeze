University of California President
 Janet Napolitano  proposed freezing undergraduate tuition for the
2014-2015 academic year.  The 10-campus system will begin exploring a new tuition
policy to reduce pricing volatility, Napolitano said today in
her first remarks to the Board of Regents since assuming the
presidency on Sept. 30. Tuition has been frozen for the past two
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
