Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN) ,
Switzerland’s biggest insurer, may say third-quarter profit rose
50 percent after a write-off related to its German business hurt
earnings in the year-earlier period.  Net income probably jumped to $1.01 billion from a restated
$672 million a year ago, according to the average estimate of
seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company will release
third-quarter earnings tomorrow at 6:45 a.m. Zurich time.  The insurer has been seeking ways to restore investor
confidence after a surprise write-off at its German general
insurance business of about $550 million last year eroded
profit. In August, the suicide of its Chief Financial Officer
Pierre Wauthier sparked the departure of Chairman  Josef Ackermann , raising doubts in the firm’s financial health.  Zurich Insurance, which has since appointed Tom de Swaan as
chairman while the position of CFO remains vacant, restated
earnings at the end of last year after a review of the German
business. Earlier this year, it was forced set aside an
additional $130 million in costs at the unit.  Third-quarter operating profit probably increased to $1.2
billion from a restated $998 million, according to the average
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The shares have increased 2.9 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 37.1 billion francs.  France ’s  Axa SA (CS) ,
 Europe ’s second-largest insurer, has gained 36 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
