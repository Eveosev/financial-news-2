Gasoline and ultra-low sulfur diesel
rose, following Brent crude higher as protests in Libya
disrupted oil exports.  Futures gained as Brent advanced as much as 1.4 percent.
Protesters stopped a tanker from docking at the port of Hariga,
said Mohamed Elharari, a spokesman for state-run National Oil
Corp. The Zawiya refinery reopened after being shut by protests
yesterday, he said. The country’s output in October was down 69
percent from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey.  “Products are being drawn up by Brent and Brent is
reacting to supply disruptions out of Libya,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for December delivery rose 4.1 cents, or 1.6

gained $1.20 to $107.01 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The more-active January contract added $1.15 to
$106.69. December Brent traded at a $13.30 premium to West Texas
Intermediate crude on Nymex, up from $12.77 yesterday.  “The Brent crude is definitely leading the way once again
and it’s keeping the products moving as well,” said Phil Flynn,
senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Gasoline Inventories  Supplies of gasoline, already the lowest in almost a year,
probably declined 900,000 barrels last week, according to the
median estimate of 11 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg. The
Energy Information Administration is scheduled to report

 Washington , a day later than usual because of the Veterans Day

a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  to Brent rose 58 cents to $3.40.  U.S.  pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 0.7 cent to
