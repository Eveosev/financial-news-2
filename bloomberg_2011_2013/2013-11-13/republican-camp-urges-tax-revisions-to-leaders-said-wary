House Republican leaders and the
party’s top tax writer are debating whether to release a plan
revamping the U.S. tax code that could limit popular breaks,
four House Republican aides said.  Republicans don’t want a distraction from their attacks on
the flawed Oct. 1 rollout of President  Barack Obama ’s health
law. Some in the party are concerned that any plan from House
Ways and Means Committee Chairman  Dave Camp  would curtail tax
breaks and take other steps that could draw criticism from
Democrats and the public.  Camp and members of the committee are scheduled to meet
tomorrow with House Majority Leader  Eric Cantor , a Virginia
Republican, with House Speaker  John Boehner  and Majority Whip
 Kevin McCarthy  also planning to attend, one of the aides said.  Republican leaders can’t stop Camp from releasing a bill,
which the Michigan lawmaker has said would call for the biggest
changes to the tax code since 1986. The leaders could urge him
to wait, say they would withhold support or ask other party
members to tell Camp that they oppose his plan.  Camp told reporters at the Capitol yesterday that he didn’t
want to prejudge the meeting, and that he wasn’t sure if he
would release the bill before the House leaves Washington Nov.
21 for the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.  “I look forward to discussing the merits of  tax reform 
with our leadership,” Camp said. “The time is right, we need a
pro-growth reform agenda.”  Party Priority  The aides spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the
intraparty quandary and said no final decisions have been made
on what to do about tax-law revisions or what leaders should
tell Camp.  The tax bill is a party priority that would advance a goal
Republicans have embraced in their budget each year since
winning the House majority in the 2010 elections. What they
haven’t done is add all of the details, showing who would win
and who would lose.  A major tax bill would affect multiple industries and
markets, including states that issue tax-exempt municipal bonds,
companies such as retailer  Macy’s Inc. (M)  that advocate lower
corporate tax rates and individuals who receive tax-free health
insurance from their employers.  ‘Entrenched Interests’  “When you open up tax reform, you always bring to the
table a lot of entrenched interests,” said Phil English, a
former Republican lawmaker from  Pennsylvania  who was a member of
the Ways and Means panel. “And the question is: Can you manage
that process politically? And can you make a compelling argument
that what you are advocating for is a significant improvement,
not only for the taxpayer but also for the economy?”  Republican leaders are concerned about the lack of a path
to a tax law before this Congress concludes at the end of 2014,
given their opposition to raising taxes and Democrats’
insistence that major  tax-code  changes be accompanied by revenue
increases, the aides said.  The issue has reached the point where Republicans must
decide whether it’s the right time to move forward, a senior
House Republican aide said.  That aide said a potential worry is opposition from
lawmakers outside the Ways and Means panel who generally support
the concept without being steeped in the details and might
object to ending specific tax breaks.  Mortgage Deduction  “There are risks involved,” said English, now a lobbyist
at Arent Fox LLP in Washington whose clients include Xcel Energy
Inc. and the American Dental Association. “There are challenges
in messaging. But this is precisely the kind of process that
should be in the Republicans’ core, should be in their area of
expertise.”  Camp has held the details of his plan closely, particularly
those on politically charged issues such as the mortgage
interest deduction, capital gains rates and the  tax exemption 
for  credit unions .  He has been holding a series of closed-door meetings with
his committee’s Republican members during the past few months as
they try to draft a proposal with the goal of lowering the top
individual rate to 25 percent from 39.6 percent and the top
corporate rate to 25 percent from 35 percent.  Camp has released discussion drafts of changes to the
taxation of international income, derivatives and small
businesses. A committee Republican aide, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Camp’s timeline hasn’t changed. Ways and
Means Republicans are scheduled to meet today.  Twitter Handle  Camp has been working with Senate Finance Committee
Chairman  Max Baucus , a Montana Democrat. They have a joint
Twitter handle on their goal of revising the tax code and went
on a multi-city tour earlier this year.  Baucus has been set to start releasing discussion drafts
and told reporters yesterday that his plans were “proceeding.”  “It’ll be soon,” Baucus said when asked when he’d release
his plan. “We’re going to have some meetings this week.”  Camp and Baucus are both trying to finish their work before
leaving their posts at the end of 2014. Camp will reach a party-set term limit that prevents him from remaining chairman. Baucus
isn’t seeking re-election.  To contact the reporters on this story:
