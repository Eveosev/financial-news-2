Indonesia’s rupiah forwards extended
gains after data showed the current-account deficit narrowed
from a record. The spot rate maintained its drop.  The shortfall was $8.4 billion in the three months through
September, compared with the revised all-time high of $9.9
billion in the previous quarter, the central bank said in a
statement posted on its website today. That’s the same as the
estimate given by  Bank Indonesia  yesterday, after it
unexpectedly raised the benchmark  interest rate  by 25 basis
points to 7.5 percent, the highest level since 2009.  “The market response was muted as the number was largely
expected,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at DBS Group
Holdings Ltd. in  Singapore . “The improvement was slight but it
would be positive if it can be sustained, which we think it will
be.”  Rupiah one-month non-deliverable forwards advanced 0.9
percent to 11,515 per dollar as of 5:36 p.m. in Jakarta,  data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The contracts were up 0.4 percent
shortly before the current-account figures were announced. The
onshore spot rate held its 0.1 percent decline to trade at
11,605, prices from local banks show. The currency touched
11,675 earlier, just shy of the four-year low of 11,680 reached
on Sept. 30.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, slid 42 basis
points, or 0.42 percentage point, to 14.76 percent. A daily
 fixing  used to settle the forwards was set at 11,473 per dollar
today, from 11,427 yesterday, according to the Association of
Banks in Singapore.  The yield on the nation’s 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023
climbed 12 basis points to 8.54 percent, prices from the Inter
Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
