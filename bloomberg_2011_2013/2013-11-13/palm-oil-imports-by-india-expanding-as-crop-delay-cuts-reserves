Palm imports by  India , the world’s
largest consumer, probably climbed in October as a delay in the
oilseed harvest reduced cooking oil stockpiles to the lowest
level in nine months.  Shipments of the main  crude  and  refined  palm oils advanced
14 percent to 710,000 metric tons from 620,385 tons a month
earlier, according to the median of estimates from five
processors and brokers compiled by Bloomberg. Total vegetable
oil imports, including those for industrial use, rose 10 percent
to 950,000 tons, the survey showed. The  Solvent Extractors’
Association  of India will release the data this week.  Increased purchases may extend a rally in prices of palm
oil, used in everything from candy to cosmetics. Futures in
Kuala Lumpur entered a bull market on Nov. 1 and are heading for
their first annual gain in three years amid production declines
in  Indonesia , the world’s biggest supplier.  “The Indian crop was delayed, leading to lower supplies
ahead of festivals,” said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive
officer of broker Sunvin Group, referring to Diwali and Eid
celebrations when consumption of fried foods and sweets expands.  An extended monsoon delayed the harvest of soybeans and
peanuts this year, said Mumbai-based Bajoria. The Soybean
Processors Association of India cut its forecast for the biggest
oilseed crop grown in the season to 12.2 million tons on Oct. 28
from 12.98 million tons.  Reserves Drop  Stockpiles of cooking oils at Indian ports dropped to 1.47
million tons on Oct. 1, the lowest since January, according to
the Solvent Extractors’ Association. Inventories may have
reached 1.6 million tons at the start of November, said Bajoria.
India meets more than half its demand through imports.  Palm for delivery in January advanced 0.2 percent to 2,605
ringgit ($811) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange today,
the highest price at close since Nov. 1. Prices rose to 2,628
ringgit on Nov. 1, the highest close since September 2012 and 21
percent more than the 2,167 ringgit settlement on July 29,
meeting the common definition of a bull market.  “Imports will start to drop from this month as the new
crop comes in,” said Pradip Desai, managing director of Mumbai-based broker Palm Trade Services Pvt. “Soybean oil import
demand will be lower.”  Vegetable oil purchases in the 11 months through September
rose 5.5 percent to 9.66 million tons, data from the association
showed. Imports will surge to 10.4 million tons to 10.5 million
tons in the year ended Oct. 31 from 10.2 million tons a year
earlier, said Bajoria.  Crude soybean oil  imports probably fell to 100,000 tons in
October from 140,971 tons a month earlier, while  sunflower oil 
purchases may have jumped to 115,000 tons from 48,498 tons, the
survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
