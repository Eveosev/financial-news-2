European Union regulators began a
probe of  Germany ’s trade surplus, using  enhanced powers  over how
euro nations manage their economies.  The decision to step up monitoring of imbalances in the
German economy follows criticism that the country’s current-account surplus -- which at 7 percent of gross domestic product
is the second highest in the euro area -- is limiting exports
from other euro countries by adding to the strength of the 
single currency.  The opening of an in-depth review into the imbalances in
Germany’s economy comes after the  U.S. Treasury  blamed German
surpluses for draining European and global growth. The
International Monetary Fund also reprimanded Germany for its
surpluses, urging German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to curtail 
the trade surplus to an “appropriate rate” to help euro 
partners cut deficits.  “Crucially, a rise in domestic demand in Germany should
help to reduce upward pressure on the euro exchange rate, easing
access to global markets for exporters in the periphery,” EU
Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said in a
blog post on Nov. 11. “Removing the bottlenecks to domestic
demand would contribute to a reduction in Germany’s external
trade surplus.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
