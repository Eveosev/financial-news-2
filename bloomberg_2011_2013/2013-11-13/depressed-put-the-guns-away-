I’m a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. I support the right of everyone except violent felons to have guns in their homes, carry them around in their cars, or wear them on their hips if they’re so inclined. But over the years, I’ve started to think that there are people who probably shouldn’t buy guns. I don’t mean “shouldn’t be allowed to”; I just mean “should exercise their Second Amendment right not to have a gun in their home.”  I’m talking about people with a history of depression. Those folks aren’t a danger to others, yet with a gun in the home, they may be a danger to themselves. “Shall issue” concealed-carry licenses don’t seem to have much impact on gun crime (either to increase or decrease it). But as Alex Tabarrok  says , they do seem to increase suicides: Someone who is very determined to commit suicide is probably going to find a way. But many people who attempt suicide are possessed by a transient impulse. In  one landmark study , the majority of people who were prevented from jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge were either alive years later or had died of natural causes. If suicide is indeed a temporary impulse, then having an extremely deadly means of self-destruction close at hand is likely to increase the percentage of successful suicides -- and indeed, that’s exactly what Tabarrok and Briggs find. So people who have had major depressive episodes in the past might be well advised to avoid gun ownership or put their guns in the care of a trusted friend. And folks who have recently gone through a horrible life event (job loss, bad breakup or the death of a loved one) would be well advised to get the guns out of the house until they’ve recovered from the blow. I don’t think this constitutes an argument for stronger gun control; automobiles are a pretty good way to kill yourself if driven into a wall at very high speed, but we do not control access to them because a very small fraction of owners might use them that way. And if you live in a very dangerous area, then I suppose you’ll have to judge the trade-offs. But responsible gun ownership means taking care that your guns are not used to harm innocent people. And if you know that your emotional history puts you at risk of taking your own life, then you should start by protecting yourself.
