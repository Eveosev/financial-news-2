Copper dropped for a second day amid
speculation the Federal Reserve will start reducing stimulus
earlier than previously expected and as output of the metal rose
to a monthly record in  China , the largest user.  The contract for delivery in three months on the London
Metal Exchange fell as much as 0.6 percent to $7,077.50 a metric
ton, the lowest level since Sept. 18, and traded at $7,093 by
10:31 a.m. in  Tokyo . The metal has declined 11 percent this
year.  Fed Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said
yesterday a reduction in U.S. bond purchases “could very well
take place” next month. Refined-copper output in October
climbed 23 percent to 637,000 tons from a year earlier,
according to data from China’s National Bureau of Statistics.
That was 2.6 percent higher than the previous all-time high of
621,000 tons in September.  “Concern about earlier-than-expected tapering of Fed
stimulus is back,” said Hwang Il Doo, a senior trader at Korea
Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul . An increase in China’s
output also put downward pressure on the market as the country
may import less in coming months, he said.  Fed policy makers will pare the monthly pace of bond buying
to $70 billion at their March 18-19 meeting, the median of 32
economist estimates in a Bloomberg News survey on Nov. 8 shows.
The group next meets Dec. 17-18.  China elevated the role of markets in the nation’s economic
strategy, while stopping short of unveiling detailed policy
shifts, after President Xi Jinping oversaw a four-day gathering
of Communist Party leaders in Beijing.  The nation will make markets “decisive” in allocating
resources, while the state will remain “dominant” in the
economy, according to yesterday’s communique from the third full
meeting, or plenum, of the party’s 18th Central Committee.  Copper for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange sank 1.1 percent to 50,940  yuan  ($8,362) a ton. Futures
for delivery in December declined 0.7 percent to $3.213 a pound
on the Comex in New York.  On the LME, lead also dropped, aluminum and zinc were
little changed, and nickel rose. Tin hadn’t traded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
