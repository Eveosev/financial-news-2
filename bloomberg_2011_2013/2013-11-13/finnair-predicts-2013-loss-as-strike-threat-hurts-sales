Finnair Oyj (FIA1S) ,  Finland ’s national
carrier, said preparations for a strike will drive it to a full-year operating loss, three weeks after the airline cut its
earnings outlook on declining passenger and cargo revenue.  Cabin crew and ground staff gearing up for 12 days of
strikes will depress sales below 2012 levels, the Vantaa,
Finland-based airline said today in a statement. Actual  strike
action  would cut revenue by 60 million euros ($80 million) and
clip the operating result by 30 million euros, it said.  The carrier last month still predicted annual revenue would
be at about the same level as 2012’s 2.45 billion euros and that
it would report an operational profit for this year. Since then,
currency swings and the possibility of the labor disruptions
have crimped the outlook.  “Each potential strike day would decrease turnover by
approximately 4.5 million euros,” Finnair said. “The labor
agreement negotiations are still on going and Finnair hopes that
an agreement is reached to avoid the strike.”  The first labor disruption would begin Nov. 15 and run
through Nov. 23, with walk outs planned for four more days from
Nov. 27.  The revised earnings forecast does not reflect a strike’s
long-term impact on bookings, it said. Finnair also downgraded
its projection for non-fuel costs which are now expected to
increase rather than fall from 2012 levels.  The previous downgrade was linked to a weakening of the
yen, which hurt Finnair as it builds Helsinki into a hub for
travel to north  Asia , exploiting its position on the shortest
“Great Circle” routes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
