Clint Hurdle of the Pittsburgh
Pirates and  Terry Francona  of the Cleveland Indians were
selected as Major League Baseball’s managers of the year.  The Cy Young Award winners for pitching excellence will be
announced tonight. Yu Darvish of the Texas Rangers, Hisashi
Iwakuma of the Seattle Mariners and Max Scherzer of the  Detroit
Tigers  are finalists for the AL award. Jose Fernandez of the
 Miami Marlins ,  Clayton Kershaw  of the  Los Angeles Dodgers  and
Adam Wainwright of the  St. Louis Cardinals  are vying for the
National League title.  Hurdle, 56, won his first National League Manager of the
Year award by leading the Pirates into the playoffs for the
first time since 1992.  Francona, 54, guided the Indians to a 92-70 record in his
first year in Cleveland, a 24-win improvement from 2012. He was
fired by the Red Sox in 2011 after Boston suffered the worst
September collapse in MLB history and missed the postseason.  “It gives me a chance to brag about our organization,”
Francona told reporters yesterday. “When you get an award like
this it’s a representation of the organization. I’ll gladly
accept it, but it’s for all these people.”  The Pirates went 94-68 this year, ending a streak of 20
straight losing seasons, and won the NL wild-card playoff game
against the  Cincinnati Reds  before losing a five-game divisional
series against the St. Louis Cardinals.  Hurdle’s Pirates won 15 more games in 2013 than the
previous season.  Mets Interview  Hurdle, who has led the Pirates to a 245-241 record the
last three seasons, came to Pittsburgh after compiling a 534-625
mark in eight years with the Colorado Rockies. He finished third
in the NL Manager of the Year balloting in 2007 after leading
the Rockies to the league pennant.  Hurdle got 25 first-place votes from members of the
Baseball Writers’ Association of America. He was selected over
Fredi Gonzalez of the  Atlanta Braves , who got three first-place
votes, and  Don Mattingly  of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who got
two. Overall, Hurdle had 140 points, followed by Mattingly with
68 and Gonzalez with 43.  Hurdle, whose playing career included three stints with the
 New York Mets  in the 1980s, was interviewed by the Mets for
their managerial opening after the 2010 season before accepting
an offer from the Pirates. The Mets hired Terry Collins.  After getting fired by the Red Sox, Francona took a one-year break from managing to work as a baseball analyst for ESPN.
He was hired by the Indians after the dismissal of manager Manny Acta and produced a team that captured the AL’s top wild-card
spot for its first trip to the postseason in six years.  Cleveland  had lost 94 games in 2012. Excluding strike-shortened seasons, it tied the largest one-year wins increase in
franchise history.  Farrell Second  Since 1969, Francona’s name was added to a list of 10
managers who had a year-over-year improvement of at least 24
wins in his first season.  Francona, who guided the Red Sox to World Series
championships in 2004 and 2007, has won at least 86 games in
nine consecutive seasons, the sixth-longest streak in baseball
history and the longest among active managers.  Francona worked in the Indians’ front office in 2001 and
his father, Tito, played for the team from 1959 to 1964.  Francona edged John Farrell of the World Series-winning Red
Sox by 16 points for the award. He had 16 first-place votes
among his 112 points, while Farrell had 12 first-place votes and
96 points.  Bob Melvin  of the Oakland Athletics, the 2012 winner
of the AL award, had two first-place votes and 36 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
