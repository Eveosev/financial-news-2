SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. (SEAS) , the
theme-park operator that sold stock to the public in April,
posted third-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates as a
drop in attendance eased and average ticket prices increased.  Net income rose 30 percent to $120.2 million, or $1.33 a
share, from $92.3 million, or $1.11, a year earlier, the
Orlando, Florida-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts had forecast profit of $1.19 a share, the average of
six  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales grew 3.1 percent to
$538.4 million, missing the $545.3 million average estimate.  SeaWorld made headway in efforts to stem falling
attendance. Admissions shrank 3.6 percent in the quarter,
compared with a 9.5 percent drop the previous three months. The
company, which cited bad weather in July and fewer discounts for
the attendance drop, was the subject of a documentary critical
of its treatment of killer whales.  The company projects revenue of $1.45 billion to $1.46
billion for the full year. In August, SeaWorld estimated sales
of as much as $1.48 billion. The company now forecasts earnings
of $432 million and $442 million before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, compared with an earlier estimate
of $430 million to $440 million.  The stock fell 2.2 percent to $32.10 in extended trading.
SeaWorld gained 2.8 percent to $32.82 at the close in New York
and has advanced 22 percent since the stock began trading in
April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
