Todd Christensen, a four-time All-Pro tight end who won two  Super Bowl  titles with the  National
Football League ’s Raiders, has died. He was 57.  Christensen died from complications of surgery, according
to a post on Twitter by  Brigham Young University  in Provo,  Utah ,
his alma mater. The  Salt Lake Tribune reported  that Christensen
had liver and other health issues, without citing the source of
its information.  Christensen played in the NFL from 1979 through 1988,
spending all but one of his 137 games with the Raiders franchise
in Oakland and Los Angeles. He had 461 career receptions for
5,872 yards and 41 touchdowns and made five straight Pro Bowl
appearances from 1983 to 1987.  “Todd was an excellent football player and was prolific in
the passing game,” Tom Flores, who coached the Raiders in
1979-87, said in a statement released by the team. “He was a
hybrid tight end, an H-back before it became a football term.”  Christensen led BYU in receiving for three straight seasons
and played on four Western Athletic Conference championship
teams. He ended his college career as the Most Valuable Player
at the Blue-Gray All-Star Classic.  Christensen entered the NFL as a second-round draft pick of
the  Dallas Cowboys  in 1978, and was released after breaking his
foot in their final preseason game. He played one game with the
 New York Giants  in 1979 before joining the Raiders, where he was
special teams captain for the club that beat the  Philadelphia
Eagles  in the Super Bowl after the 1980 season.  Reception Leader  Christensen became a starter during the strike-shortened
1982 season and led the NFL in receptions in 1983 and 1986, when
he had a career-high 95 catches. Christensen won a second Super
Bowl title with the Raiders following the 1983 season, when he
led the team with 12 touchdowns.  “I remember Todd as always using big words and quoting
famous authors and poets,” Flores said. “He was comical at
times because no one knew what he was talking about.”  A 1992 inductee into the  BYU Hall of Fame , Christensen
worked as an NFL analyst for NBC after his playing career. He
also was a college football analyst for ESPN and the
MountainWest Sports Network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
