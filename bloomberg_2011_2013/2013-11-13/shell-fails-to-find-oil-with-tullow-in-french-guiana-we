Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Tullow Oil
Plc failed to find oil or natural gas in their last planned
exploration well off  French Guiana , a partner said.  The companies drilled the GM-ES-5 well to a total depth of
6,460 meters (21,200 feet),  Northern Petroleum Plc (NOP)  said today in
a statement. The well will be plugged and abandoned.  “Reservoir sequences were encountered as expected but with
no evidence of hydrocarbons,” Northern Petroleum said. “Once
the drill ship, the Stena ICEMax, has completed the abandonment
operations it will move to a location outside French Guiana.”  The result marks the fourth unsuccessful well off the Latin
American country, where Tullow made the first oil find with its
Zaedyus well in 2011. The Shell-led joint venture, which also
includes  Total SA (FP)  and Wessex Exploration Plc, will suspend
drilling until 2015, Northern Petroleum said in September.  Tullow said today in a separate statement that the GM-ES-5
well had reached its target depth and “evaluation operations
are ongoing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
