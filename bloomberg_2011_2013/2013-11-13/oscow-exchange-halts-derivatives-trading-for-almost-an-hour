OAO Moscow Exchange halted
derivatives trading between 1 p.m. and 1:58 p.m. today.  The stoppage, which also affected the Standard sector of
the bourse’s securities market division, was due to a technical
issue, according to a  statement  on its website. Moscow
Exchange’s shares climbed 0.5 percent to 65.05 rubles by 2:19
p.m. in Moscow.  “Our phones have been ringing with angry clients,” Luis Saenz, head of equity sales and trading at BCS Financial Group
in  London , said by e-mail.  The exchange halted derivatives and standard sector trading
for 30 minutes on Jan. 25. It stopped its main-market trading
for technical reasons on May 17, while currency trading was
frozen April 23. The Moscow Exchange must end frequent trading
stoppages that hurt  Russia ’s goal of becoming a global financial
hub,  Dmitry Pankin , former head of the market watchdog, said
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
