New York’s subway and bus commuters
will see fares rise more slowly than projected over the next few
years, the  Metropolitan Transportation Authority  said.  A year after  Hurricane Sandy  caused about $5 billion in
damage to its system, the agency said increased cost cutting,
lower expenses and higher operating revenue should allow
officials to raise fares and tolls by 4 percent instead of the
projected 7.5 percent in 2015 and 2017. Chief Financial Officer
Robert Foran told board members of the projections today at a
meeting in  Manhattan .  “We try to keep costs down in order to minimize the
financial burden on our customers, and as this financial plan
shows, we are succeeding in that effort,” Chairman Thomas
Prendergast said in a statement.  In March, the MTA raised its base fare for subways and
buses by 25 cents to $2.50 and monthly unlimited passes by $8 to
$112.  Smaller biennial fare and toll increases through 2017 would
reduce revenue by $905 million, according to the November
financial plan that Foran presented today. The agency said it
will offset the loss of revenue by boosting internal cost
cutting. The plan eliminates $240 million in deficits for next
year through 2016 while projecting a gap of $191 million in
2017.  Risks to the budget remain, including the assumption that
the agency will achieve the net-zero wage increases it seeks
from unionized employees currently working under expired
contracts.  The MTA employs 66,000 workers and carries 8.5 million
riders a day on subways, buses and commuter railroads. Board
members will vote on the final budget next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
