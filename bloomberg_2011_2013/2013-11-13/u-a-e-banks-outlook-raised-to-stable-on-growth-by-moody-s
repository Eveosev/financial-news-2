The outlook for the United Arab
Emirates’ banking industry was raised to stable from negative by
Moody’s Investors Service as economic growth rebounds and the
real-estate market recovers in the second-biggest Arab economy.  Those factors “will lead to a decline in problem loan
levels and an increase in profitability over the next 12 to 18
months,” Moody’s said in a report today. “Banks will continue
to maintain high liquidity and capital buffers that were built
up since the onset of the global financial crisis.”  U.A.E. bank earnings are recovering after the credit crisis
sparked a property crash, prompting a surge in loan-loss
provisions after defaults jumped. Moody’s said it expects loan
growth of 7 percent to 10 percent next year as the U.A.E.’s
economy grows 3.6 percent this year and 3.7 percent next,
supported by  government spending  and a recovery in Dubai’s
diversified economy.  U.A.E. banks’ ratio of problem loans to gross loans will
improve to between 8 percent and 9 percent over the next 18
months from 10.5 percent at the end of 2012 and 9.5 percent at
the end of June, Moody’s said in the report.  Lower loan-loss provisions together with modest asset
growth will support an increase in U.A.E. banks’ net income to
around 2.5 percent of risk weighted assets over the period, from
about 2 percent at the end of 2012, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
