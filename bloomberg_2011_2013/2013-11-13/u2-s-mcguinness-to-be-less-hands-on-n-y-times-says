 U2 manager Paul McGuinness will
take a “less hands-on role” in running the band’s affairs as
he nears a deal to sell his management company to  Live Nation
Entertainment Inc. (LYV) , the New York Times reported.  Live Nation is in advanced talks to buy McGuinness’s
Principle Management firm and Maverick Records LLC, the company
run by Madonna’s manager Guy Oseary, for more than $30 million,
the newspaper said, citing people with direct knowledge of the
matter.  Oseary will take over McGuinness’s day-to-day management of
U2 if the deal is consummated, the newspaper said, citing a
statement from McGuinness.  A woman who answered the phone at Principle Management in
Dublin said the firm declined to comment to  Bloomberg News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
