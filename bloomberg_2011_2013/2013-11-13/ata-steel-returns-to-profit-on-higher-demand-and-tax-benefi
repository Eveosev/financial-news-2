Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) ,  India ’s biggest
producer of the alloy, returned to profit and reported earnings
that were almost triple analysts’ estimates because of higher
demand and a tax benefit.  Group net income, including that of unit Tata Steel  Europe 
Ltd., was 9.17 billion rupees ($145 million) in the three months
ended Sept. 30, compared with a 3.64 billion rupees loss a year
ago, according to an exchange filing. The median profit of 25
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 3.3 billion rupees.
Net sales at Mumbai-based Tata Steel, which had a tax benefit of
3.9 billion rupees, gained 7.4 percent to 363.7 billion rupees.  Consumption improved in Europe, which accounts for two-thirds of Tata Steel’s output, while higher production in India
helped boost sales. Tata Steel sold 2.04 million metric tons of
the alloy, or 18 percent more, from its Indian operations in the
quarter, while sales in Europe rose 1 percent to 3.46 million
tons. Group shipments rose 6.7 percent to 6.48 million tons from
a year earlier and gained 10 percent over the previous quarter.  ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s biggest steelmaker, said Oct. 18
it expects to see a rebound in European auto production next
year as the continent’s consumers buy more family cars. European
monthly car sales rose the most in more than two years in
September as the end of a recession in the region and price cuts
helped boost purchases.  The European PMI survey crossed a level of 50 in July for
the first time in two years. That signifies an expansion of
manufacturing compared with the previous month.  Total expenses at Tata Steel rose 3.7 percent to 343.8
billion rupees in the quarter, while raw material expenses
climbed almost 10 percent to 115.7 billion rupees.  Tata Steel  shares , which have slumped 17 percent this year,
rose 1.5 percent to 357.75 rupees in Mumbai today. The earnings
were announced after trading closed.  The company said on Oct. 29 it will cut 500 mainly
management and administrative jobs in the U.K. to lower costs.
Jobs will go in Scunthorpe, Teesside and Workington, the company
had said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
