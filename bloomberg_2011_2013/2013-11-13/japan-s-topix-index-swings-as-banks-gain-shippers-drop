Japan ’s  Topix index  fell, snapping a
two-day rally, as investors weighed corporate earnings and
shipping companies and builders led losses.  Nippon Yusen K.K. fell 2.4 percent after a measure of
commodity shipping rates dropped for a fourth day yesterday.
Obayashi Corp. sank 4.4 percent, the most on the Nikkei 225
Stock Average, as construction shares extended losses.  Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)  gained 1.6 percent after the
country’s second-biggest lender by market value raised its full-year profit forecast 29 percent.  The Topix slid 0.1 percent to close at 1,204.19 in  Tokyo 
after climbing as much as 0.4 percent. Volume was 9.6 percent
above the 30-day intraday average. The measure yesterday posted
its largest advance in two weeks, rising 1.7 percent. The Nikkei
225 today slid 0.2 percent today to 14,567.16. The yen climbed
0.1 percent to 99.51 per dollar after three days of losses.
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President  Dennis Lockhart  said
yesterday stimulus may be reduced next month.  “More people think the U.S. recovery is gathering pace and
the yen has also weakened, both of which are good for Japanese
exporters,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo
at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., a unit of Japan’s second-biggest
lender by market value. “But stocks have risen at a fast pace
since the start of the week and speculation is growing that the
U.S. will cut back on quantitative easing earlier.”  Stimulus Outlook  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 0.3
percent. The measure lost 0.2 percent yesterday as corporate
earnings and an improving economy fueled speculation the Fed
will reduce bond purchases next month. Investors will scrutinize
U.S. economic reports this week on jobless-benefit claims and
manufacturing in the  New York  area. Dallas Fed President  Richard Fisher  said in a speech in  Melbourne  that monetary accommodation
“becomes riskier by the day.”  The Topix is the best-performing developed equity market in
2013, surging 40 percent, amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe’s policies and  Bank of Japan  monetary easing will lead the
country out of deflation.  More than 800 Topix companies have released earnings this
month, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Of the companies
on the gauge that have reported  quarterly earnings  this season
and for which Bloomberg has analyst estimates, 61 percent beat
profit expectations, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Building stocks fell a second day. Obayashi sank 4.4
percent to 562 yen, extending a 3 percent loss from the day
before when the company cut its operating-profit forecast.
Kajima Corp., another construction company, lost 4.4 percent to
372 yen. Taisei Corp. declined 3.1 percent to 469 yen.  Shippers Slide  A Topix group tracking shipping lines lost 1.6 percent, the
most among the broader equity gauge’s 33 subsectors, after the
 Baltic Dry Index (BDIY)  slid 1.3 percent yesterday for a fourth day of
losses. Nippon Yusen, Japan’s largest company in the sector,
sank 2.4 percent to 291 yen. Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd., the second
biggest, slipped 1.4 percent to 410 yen.  Sumitomo Mitsui  gained 1.6 percent to 4,945 yen. Net income
will probably total 750 billion yen ($7.5 billion) in the year
ending March 31, the Tokyo-based bank said yesterday. That
compares with the 580 billion yen previously forecast and the
696.7 billion-yen average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Resona Holdings Inc. climbed 0.8 percent to 516 yen
after raising its net-income forecast by 28 percent to 185
billion yen.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Mizuho Financial
Group Inc., the first- and third-largest lenders, respectively,
are scheduled to post earnings tomorrow.  Pioneer Surges  “Banking shares with large market capitalizations are
performing strongly overall, and that’s having a positive impact
mainly on domestic demand-driven industries,” said Kenji Shiomura, a Tokyo-based senior strategist at Daiwa Securities
Group Inc., Japan’s second-largest brokerage.  Pioneer Corp. surged 22 percent to 202 yen, its biggest
gain since May. The maker of car stereos posted operating profit
of 569 million yen for the six months ended September, while
analysts had expected a 2.5 billion-yen loss, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Seiko Holdings Corp. (8050)  surged 9.4 percent to 502 yen, its
highest close since July. The watchmaker yesterday more than
doubled its net-income forecast to 11 billion yen.  Brother Industries Ltd. (6448)  jumped 4.5 percent to 1,124 yen
after Credit Suisse Group AG advised buying the sewing-machine
maker’s shares.  Orders for Japanese machinery fell more than forecast in
September, a report showed today, slipping 2.1 percent from the
previous month. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a
1.8 percent decline.  Machine Orders  “The drop in machinery orders in September was in line
with market expectations,” said Kenji Shiomura, a Tokyo-based
senior strategist at Daiwa Securities Group Inc., Japan’s
second-largest brokerage. “They may be slightly down on the
median estimate, but this is a very volatile data series and the
impact on Japanese stocks will be limited.”  Komatsu Ltd., which makes excavators and bulldozers, added
0.5 percent to 2,171 yen. Hitachi Construction Machinery Co.
advanced 0.4 percent to 2,093 yen.  The  Topix  (TPX) traded  at 1.23 times book value today, compared
with 2.55 for the S&P 500 and 1.80 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
