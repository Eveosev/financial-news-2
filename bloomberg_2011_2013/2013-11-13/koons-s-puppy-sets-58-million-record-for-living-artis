Jeff Koons’s sculpture “Balloon
Dog” sold for $58.4 million at Christie’s in New York tonight,
an auction record for a living artist.  Estimated at $35 million to $55 million, the 10-foot-tall
stainless-steel structure was consigned by newsprint magnate
 Peter Brant .  Christie’s guaranteed “Balloon Dog” would sell for an
undisclosed minimum price, financed through third parties.  The price smashed Koons’s previous record of $33.7 million
and the record for the most expensive living artist, held by
Gerhard Richter, whose 1968 painting, “Domplatz, Mailand,”
sold for $37.1 million at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
