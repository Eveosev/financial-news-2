Palm oil  advanced for a third day to
the highest level in more than a week on speculation that demand
for the tropical oil as feedstock will increase as Indonesia
accelerates its biodiesel program.  The contract for January delivery climbed 0.7 percent to
2,618 ringgit ($816) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the highest price for most-active futures since
Nov. 4. Prices jumped the most since Aug. 26 yesterday on
speculation that output in Indonesia and Malaysia, the biggest
producers, will start tapering from November.  Wilmar International Ltd. submitted a tender proposal for
Indonesian biodiesel, the Singapore-based company said today.
Indonesia’s biodiesel consumption may more than double to six
million tons in 2014, Sugiharto, president commissioner of state
oil company PT Pertamina said on Nov. 9. The country raised
blending rate for biodiesel in subsidized-diesel oil to 10
percent in September from 7.5 percent and the mandate will be
imposed for non-subsidized diesel and industrial users, and 20
percent blending for  power plants  starting January.  “We are positive on the demand prospects for biodiesel in
Indonesia, in view of the government plans to raise biodiesel
blend in transport,” said Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB Investment
Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “Exports have been weak in the first
10 days, but expectations are that they will improve.”  Indonesia’s biodiesel capacity may jump to 8.8 million
kiloliters by the end of 2015 from 5.6 million kiloliters this
year, Paulus Tjakrawan, secretary general of the Indonesia
Biofuel Producers Association said today.  Soybean oil  for December delivery increased 0.3 percent to
40.89 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
delivery in January were little changed at $13.135 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for May delivery gained 1.2 percent to
6,300 yuan ($1,034) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  and
soybean oil advanced 0.5 percent to 7,220  yuan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
