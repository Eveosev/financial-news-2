Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV) , the
second-biggest U.K. homebuilder by market value, said advance
sales climbed 47 percent after lending improved and the
government’s Help to Buy plan increased demand for homes.  Private forward sales, or homes paid for though not yet
built, rose to 1.13 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) as of Nov. 10
from 768.5 million pounds a year earlier, the Leicestershire,
England-based company said in a statement today. More than 2,800
reservations were made through Help to Buy, which allows people
to purchase homes costing as much as 600,000 pounds with a down
payment of as little as 5 percent.  “The market remains strong, driven by better lending
conditions and improving customer confidence, Chief Executive
Officer Mark Clare said in the statement. ‘‘We are increasing
production and investment for the future.’’  Prime Minister  David Cameron  is seeking to stimulate the
U.K. economy by boosting  home construction . Help to Buy has
contributed to the most buoyant housing market since the
financial crisis, even as two thirds of 31 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg described it as ‘‘bad policy.’’  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
