Demand for silver fabrication
climbed this year, paced by gains in coin and jewelry
consumption, as prices tumbled into a  bear market  in April,
Thomson Reuters GFMS said.  Fabrication demand will rise to 877 million ounces in 2013,
up 3.9 percent from 844 million last year, the researcher said
in a report published by the Washington-based  Silver Institute .
Use in jewelry will gain 5.6 percent, while consumption in coin
and medal purchases is forecast to surge 19 percent to 110.5
million ounces  Silver prices tumbled 31 percent this year partly on
concern that the  Federal Reserve  would reduce the pace of U.S.
monetary stimulus. The slump attracted buyers of physical metal.
The  U.S. Mint  sold a record 40.175 million ounces of American
Eagle coins in 2013, topping the previous annual all-time high
of 39.869 million in 2011, the mint said yesterday.  “One of the defining characteristics of the silver market
is its display of duality, at times closely shadowing
developments in the gold market and at others, taking cues more
from the industrial world,” London-based GFMS said. “This
trend is forecast to continue into 2014.”  Silver prices will trade from $20.20 an ounce to $23.70
through the end of the year, averaging $24.24 for 2013, GFMS
said. Implied demand from the investment sector will drop to
143.8 million ounces from 162.60 million in 2012.  On the Comex in  New York , silver futures for December
delivery fell 2.4 percent to $20.778 an ounce yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
