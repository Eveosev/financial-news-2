  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) ,
Japan’s second-largest brokerage, reopened 20 of its retail
branches as an anticipated power outage didn’t occur, said
spokesman Hiroharu Misawa.  Daiwa earlier said it will close the branches and may shut
as many as 33 of its 120 outlets because Tokyo Electric Power
Co. initially planned for the blackout. The closed branches
sustained no major damage from the quake and telephone
brokerage services were available.    Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ’s 174 branches were all open today,
though as many as 51 were subject to power shortages following
Japan’s March 11 earthquake and tsunami, said Keiko Sugai, a
Tokyo-based spokeswoman at the brokerage.  Nomura’s shares fell 8.9 percent at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo  today, and Daiwa declined 7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
