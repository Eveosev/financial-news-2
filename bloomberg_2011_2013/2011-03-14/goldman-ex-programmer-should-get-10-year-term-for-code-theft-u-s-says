Former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov should get as much as 121
months in prison for stealing the firm’s computer source code,
U.S. prosecutors said in a court filing.  Aleynikov, convicted in December of violating the Economic
Espionage Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen
Property Act, has asked to be given probation when he is
sentenced by U.S. District Court judge Denise Cote on March 18.
Prosecutors cited Aleynikov’s alleged history of violating
intellectual property laws, asking Cote to sentence him to 97 to
121 months.  “Aleynikov was simply a thief motivated by greed, someone
who sought to benefit from the valuable intellectual property of
his employer to make money for himself and his new company,”
prosecutors said in a sentencing memorandum filed in  Manhattan 
federal court March 11.  On Feb. 24, Cote ordered Aleynikov, who had been free on
bond, jailed before sentencing because she deemed him a flight
risk. Aleynikov, who is a naturalized U.S. citizen, holds dual
U.S.-Russian citizenship, said his attorney  Kevin Marino .  The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
