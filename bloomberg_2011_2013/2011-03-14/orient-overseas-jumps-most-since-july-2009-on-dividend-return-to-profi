Orient Overseas (International)
Ltd., operator of  Hong Kong ’s biggest container line, jumped the
most in more than a year on the city’s stock exchange after
pledging to pay a $2.09 special dividend.  The company climbed 10 percent, the biggest gain since
January 2010, to HK$79.85 at the close. It has risen 28 percent
in the past year, compared with a 10 percent gain for the  Hang
Seng Index. (HSI)   The shipping line offered the dividend after the sale of
real-estate assets and a rebound in trade helped it post an
annual profit of $1.9 billion last year. A year earlier, the
company made a loss as shipments plunged amid the global
recession.  The dividend is “much higher than market and our
expectations,” Lawrence Li and Aochao Wang, analysts at UOB Kay
Hian Holdings Ltd., wrote in a note today.  Orient Overseas, which also offered a final dividend of 23
cents, expects the outlook for the industry to be positive this
year with supply and demand “evenly balanced,” Chief Financial
Officer Ken Cambie told reporters in Hong Kong today.  --Liza Lin. Editors: Neil Denslow, Alan Soughley  To contact the reporter on this story:
