A 30-year-old foreign national
arrested in Glasgow last week was charged with terrorism
offenses in connection with a suicide bombing in  Stockholm  in
December, Scottish police said.  The man, who wasn’t named, was arrested March 8 in
Glasgow’s Whiteinch neighborhood and charged with offenses under
the Terrorism Act 2000, police said in a statement today. The
man is expected to appear today at Glasgow Sherriff Court,
police said.  Swedish police are treating the two blasts that occurred a
few hundred meters apart and close to a street crowded with
Christmas shoppers as the country’s first brush with terror. The
bomber left recordings warning of strikes to defend Islam
against the “war being waged” on it.  Unlike neighboring Denmark, which became a target of
Islamist anger in 2006 after its biggest newspaper published
caricatures of the  Prophet Muhammad , Swedish police until
October had deemed the threat of any terrorist attack to be
“low.” The September general election brought the anti-
immigration Sweden Democrats into parliament for the first time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
