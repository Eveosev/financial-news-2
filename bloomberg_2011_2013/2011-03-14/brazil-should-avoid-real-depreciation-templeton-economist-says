The Brazilian government shouldn’t
try to devalue the real as a strong dollar would be inconsistent
with its efforts to fight inflation, said Carlos Thadeu de Freitas Gomes Filho, senior economist at  Franklin Templeton
Investimentos Brasil .  “At this point, when they have to choose between foreign
exchange and inflation, the government should choose
inflation,” Filho said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Sao Paulo
office today. The Templeton unit manages $618 million in  Brazil .  Brazil’s most recent foreign exchange measure to combat
appreciation of the real was Jan. 6, when the central bank set a  reserve requirements  on short dollar positions held by local
banks. The bank also resumed auctions of reverse currency swap
contracts, which is a bet against the real in the futures
market.  “There may be yet more, but the government’s appetite for
exchange rate measures is falling,” he said.  The real has risen 40 percent against the dollar in the
last two years, the second-best performer among 25 currencies of
emerging countries tracked by Bloomberg. The South African rand
appreciated the most during the period.  Consumer inflation may surpass the target ceiling of 6.5
percent and reach 7 percent during 2011, closing the year at 6.3
percent, Gomes Filho said.  Consumer prices will rise 5.82 percent this year, compared
with a week-earlier forecast of 5.78 percent, according to a
March 11 central bank survey of about 100 economists published
today. Inflation expectations for 2012 were unchanged at 4.80
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
