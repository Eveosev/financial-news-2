Energia Austral, a unit of  Xstrata
Plc (XTA) , is considering building part of a transmission line through  Argentina  for hydroelectric projects it’s developing in southern  Chile , Diario Financiero reported.  Building part of the line in Argentina would reduce costs
and avert potential conflicts with indigenous communities in
southern Chile, the Santiago-based financial newspaper reported,
citing people familiar with the project that it didn’t identify.  Viviana Alarcon, a spokeswoman for Xstrata, didn’t respond
to a telephone message seeking comment.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
