  China ’s stocks fluctuated as steel
makers rallied on speculation that  Japan ’s reconstruction
efforts after the earthquake will boost demand for metals, while
airlines retreated as the temblor disrupted flights.  China Southern Airlines Co., the nation’s largest carrier,
led declines for carriers after cancelling flights to Japan.
Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. and Angang Steel Co. gained more than 2
percent.  “The Japan earthquake may have a limited effect on the
stock market,” said Tu Jun, a strategist at Shanghai Securities
Co. “The market has priced in the negative impact in the
previous trading day and may rebound amid fluctuations today.”
“The quake’s effect is more on the psychological side.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, added 0.1 percent to 2,937.62 at 11:10
a.m. The measure lost 0.3 percent last week. The CSI 300 Index
rose 0.3 percent to 3,257.69.  The Shanghai index has gained 4.6 percent this year on
optimism the world’s second-biggest economy will withstand
tighter monetary policies. Manufacturing expanded in January
even after the central bank boosted banks’ reserve requirement
ratio eight times since the start of 2010 and raised  interest
rates  three times to cool inflation.  Japanese stocks tumbled the most in two years today after
the 8.9-magnitude earthquake snarled production lines and shut
down factories, raising concern economic growth will stall.  --Irene Shen. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
