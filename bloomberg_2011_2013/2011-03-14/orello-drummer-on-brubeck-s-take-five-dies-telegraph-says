Joe Morello, who played drums in
the Dave Brubeck Quartet for 12 years, and whose work can be
heard on “Take Five” and “Blue Rondo a la Turk” in 1959,
died on Saturday, the  Daily Telegraph  reported. He was 82.  After Brubeck disbanded the group in 1967, Morello started
teaching, with one of his pupils being Max Weinberg, drummer
with  Bruce Springsteen ’s E Street Band, the newspaper said.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
