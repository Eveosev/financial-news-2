The  African Development Bank  is
reviewing its funding to North African countries to focus on
projects that boost jobs and reduce poverty after popular
revolts in Egypt and  Tunisia  forced the collapse of governments.  “Like all development partners in Tunisia, we were caught
by surprise,” Donald Kaberuka, president of the bank, said
yesterday in an interview in  South Africa ’s capital,  Pretoria .
“We are having now to recalibrate our policies for North
Africa, to try and address the issues of poverty and social
exclusion.”  Longtime rulers in Tunisia and Egypt were ousted in the
past two months by protest movements sparked initially by
dissatisfaction over joblessness and corruption. The AfDB, which
is based in Tunisia’s capital, Tunis, had focused its funding in
the North African country on infrastructure projects as the
economy expanded an average of 4.7 percent in the past five
years, according to data from the  International Monetary Fund .  “We are re-examining completely our strategy in North
Africa,” Kaberuka said. “These are economies that were growing
about 4.5 percent for the past decade. But there was very little  job creation .”  The AfDB has already committed $2 billion to Tunisia to
help support the economy following the ousting of the
government, Kaberuka said. Future loans will be focused on
lending to small and medium-sized businesses, which have a
higher potential to create jobs, and in agricultural industries
in the south and west of the country, he said.  “We will direct our investment at areas where there are
high multipliers for job creation,” Kaberuka said.  New Policies  With the revolutions in Tunisia and  Egypt  spreading to
Middle Eastern countries, including Bahrain, Yemen and Jordan,
multilateral institutions such as the AfDB and  World Bank  are
tailoring policies to better address citizens’ concerns. The
World Bank on March 3 unveiled a new policy for Africa that
focuses on fighting corruption and boosting democracy.  “Underlying Africa’s many development problems is the
challenge of governance and political leadership,” the World
Bank said in a  report  released earlier this month. “The events
of the past few weeks in the Middle East have reinforced the
notion that governance lies at the heart of the development
challenge.”  The AfDB will begin talks with authorities in Egypt on
funding projects there, Kaberuka said.  Economic output in North Africa will probably contract this
year as production in Tunisia, Egypt,  Libya  and other nations
are disrupted, Kaberuka said.  For Sub-Saharan Africa, the AfDB is maintaining its growth
forecast of 5.5 percent for this year even as food and oil
prices increase, Kaberuka said. Many African nations are
benefiting from higher prices of oil and other commodities, such
as copper, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
