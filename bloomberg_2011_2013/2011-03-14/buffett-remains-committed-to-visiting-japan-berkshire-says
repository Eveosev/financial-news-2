Billionaire Warren Buffett remains
committed to visiting Japan after an earthquake struck the
country last week, according to his  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)   “He is still planning to go to Japan,” said Debbie Bosanek, an assistant to Buffett at Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire, in an e-mail today. She didn’t provide further
details.  Buffett, 80, canceled a planned visit to Tungaloy Corp. for
a plant opening that had been scheduled for next week in Japan’s
Fukushima prefecture, Tungaloy said in an earlier statement.
Buffett is visiting Asian nations including India and  South
Korea  to review Berkshire operations and seek investments.  The earthquake and a subsequent tsunami may have killed
10,000 in Miyagi prefecture, north of Tokyo, said Go Sugawara, a
spokesman for the prefectural police department. The official
toll reached 1,823 dead and 2,369 missing, the  National Police
Agency  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
