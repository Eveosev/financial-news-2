French stocks dropped as concern
grew about the safety of nuclear plants damaged by  Japan ’s worst
earthquake on record.    Renault SA (RNO) , which has a stake in Japan’s Nissan Motor Co.,
fell.  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  led declines in  luxury
goods  companies.  France’s  CAC 40 Index (CAC)  tumbled 134.05, or 3.5 percent, to
3,743.99 at noon in Paris for the biggest decline since June.
The index has dropped 9.9 percent from its 2011 high, reached on
Feb. 18. The SBF 120 Index retreated 3.4 percent today.  Japan’s Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said the danger of further
leaks from a nuclear power plant damaged by the earthquake was
increasing. The Bank of Japan added 8 trillion yen ($98 billion)
into money markets today, adding to yesterday’s record cash
injection, to secure the nation’s financial stability following
the March 11 temblor -- updated to a magnitude of 9, from 8.9,
by the  U.S. Geological Survey  -- and subsequent tsunami. Tokyo
Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant was today
rocked by two more explosions and a fire.  Renault sank 4.1 percent to 36.63 euros. France’s second-
biggest carmaker has a 43 percent stake in Nissan.  LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury goods company, lost 5.4
percent to 100.90 euros.  PPR (PP)  SA, the French owner of Gucci and
online retailer Redcats, slid 5.7 percent to 99.75 euros. Japan
is the world’s second-largest market for luxury goods after the
U.S., accounting for 11 percent of global sales, according to
consulting firm Bain & Co.    Areva SA (CEI) , the world’s largest maker of nuclear reactors,
tumbled 8.3 percent to 28.90 euros.  Electricite de France SA,  Europe ’s biggest power generator,
retreated 3.5 percent to 27.95 euros. The stock was cut to
“sell” from “buy” at Aurel BGC, which predicted that
regulators will rewrite the rules governing nuclear power
stations in the aftermath of the escape of radioactive steam
from Japan’s earthquake-hit atomic power facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
