Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas  condemned the murders of five family members at a
West Bank settlement home over the weekend, while denying
Israeli charges of Palestinian incitement.  “A human being is not capable of carrying out such an
act,” Abbas told  Israel  Radio today, adding that the PA would
have prevented the attack if it had had advanced knowledge of
it. Credit for the killings was claimed by a Palestinian
militant group.  Abbas rejected charges by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu that the PA is not doing enough to prevent incitement
against Israel in West Bank mosques and schools. He told Israel
Radio that mosque sermons are monitored, and said he is willing
to have a joint Palestinian-Israel-U.S. committee check
Palestinian textbooks for incitement.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
