  San Miguel Corp. (SMC) , the largest
Philippine food and drinks company, said oil refiner  Petron
Corp. (PCOR)  will probably boost earnings this year after profit
declined in 2010.  Petron, the refinery unit, will be fully consolidated this
year and will “considerably boost” 2011 earnings, the Manila-
based foodmaker said in a statement today. Net income fell to
20.1 billion pesos ($462 million), from 57.8 billion pesos in
2009 when  San Miguel  sold a stake in a beer unit. Revenue rose
41 percent to 246.1 billion pesos and recurring profit doubled.  The company that started making San Miguel Beer more than
a century ago has also expanded into industries such as
telecommunications, mining and power retailing. President Ramon Ang said the strategy will boost return on equity almost
threefold from the 7 percent level it previously earned from
food and drinks.  “We are still in the very early stages of our
diversification strategy but our energy business is pulling its
share of the weight,” Chairman Eduardo Cojuangco said in the
statement. “In a year or so, energy could be a major
contributor” to San Miguel, he said.  San Miguel in December said it owns about 68 percent of
Petron, the larger of the  Philippines ’ two oil refiners.  Petron Profit  The refiner had a record profit of 7.9 billion pesos in
2010 on sales of 229.1 billion pesos, Petron said in an e-
mailed statement today, without providing comparative numbers.  Petron will probably contribute about 230 billion pesos to
San Miguel’s sales this year, making it the biggest source of
revenue, Ang said in a Feb. 3 interview.  San Miguel fell 2.1 percent to 160.30 pesos at the 12 p.m.
close of trading in  Manila , before the earnings announcement.
The stock has more than doubled in the past year, outperforming
the benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index’s 28
percent gain.  Petron declined 1.4 percent to 15 pesos, paring its gain
over the past year to 168 percent.  San Miguel’s investments include a holding in  Manila
Electric Co. (MER) , 10 percent of mineral-exploration company  Indophil Resources NL (IRN) , a toll-road venture and part ownership
of a company that has a contract to build a railway in Manila.  San Miguel reported 2010 operating income rose to 34.8
billion pesos, from 19.7 billion pesos a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
