The earthquake that struck  Japan 
last week caused temporary “panic” in the  iron ore  market
though it’s impact is likely to be limited as the nation’s steel
mills restart, Hu Muzhong, the managing director of Hong Kong-
based Central Minerals Co. said in an interview. “There’s some
panic in the iron ore market,” said Hu, whose company trades
about $300 million worth of steelmaking raw materials a year,
including 3 million tons of iron ore. “The impact of the quake
is more psychological. The steel plant closure in Japan, in my
view, won’t take more than two months because governments’ are
now more capable in crisis
control.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
