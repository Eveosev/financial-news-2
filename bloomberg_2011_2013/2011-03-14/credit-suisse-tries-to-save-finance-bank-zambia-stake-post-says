  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  officials
met with Zambiaâ€™s central bank to save its 40 percent stake in
 Finance Bank Zambia Ltd.  before the lender is sold, the  Post 
reported, without identifying how it got the information.  The Bank of Zambia terminated shareholder interest in
Finance Bank in December and has called for bids to buy the
lender, the Lusaka-based newspaper said on its website. Credit
Suisse bought its stake in the bank in 1998, the Post said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
