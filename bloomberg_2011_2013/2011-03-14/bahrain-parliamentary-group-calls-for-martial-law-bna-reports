A parliamentary bloc in Bahrain has
called for the government to implement martial law after police
fought with mainly Shiite pro-democracy demonstrators yesterday,
the  Bahrain News Agency  reported.  The Independent Bloc appealed to King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa to “intervene and protect national security,” the
Manama-based news service reported, without saying where it get
the information. The bloc also urged a ban “on all illegitimate
acts which may instigate violence and terror,” BNA said.  Bahrain police fought with pro-democracy demonstrators
seeking to block access to the nation’s financial center. The
clashes left 100 protesters and 14 officers injured, according
to hospital and government officials.  Shiites, who comprise as much as 70 percent of Bahrain’s
population, say they face discrimination over jobs and housing
from the ruling Al Khalifa family, who are Sunnis, and their
supporters. The calls for free elections, more housing and jobs
echo movements that have swept the region in the past two months
and unseated longtime rulers in Tunisia and  Egypt .  Bahrain’s Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa said
yesterday he is committed to starting a dialogue with the
opposition that would address demands including “a parliament
with full authority,” a “government that represents the will
of the people” and the creation of “fair voting districts.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
