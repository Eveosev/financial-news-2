  Brazil ’s port of Paranagua, the
second-biggest in the South American nation, said trucks are
unable to make deliveries after rainfall damaged roads and
bridges leading to the port in southern Parana state.  Above-average rainfall since the beginning of the month
caused landslides and destroyed three bridges on March 11 on the
BR 277 federal road, which links Curitiba to the port, said an
Ecovia press officer, who declined to be named, in a telephone
interview today from Curitiba. Ecovia is the toll road operator.  The port is keeping up with scheduled shipments using
stored grains, said a port press official, who asked not to be
identified, citing company policy. The port has the capacity to
store 1.5 million metric tons of grains, which would be shipped
within 10 days without rain, the press official said.  A backlog of trucks 13 kilometers (8 miles) long waits
about 60 kilometers from the port to unload cargo, Ecovia said.  Santos Port, Brazil’s largest, is in Sao Paulo state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
