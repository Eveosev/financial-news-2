  Kenya ’s  Energy Regulatory
Commission  set maximum retail prices for regular gasoline at
100.9 shillings ($1.17) a liter (0.26 gallons) in the capital,
Nairobi, an increase of 2.8 percent from the previous month.  The price cap is effective from tomorrow until April 14,
the Nairobi-based regulator said in its monthly review of fuel
costs e-mailed today. Nairobi accounts for as much as 55 percent
of total fuel consumption in the East African nation.  Unrest in North Africa and the Middle East has “exerted
pressure” on  oil prices , which is reflected in the Kenyan fuel
cost increase, Kaburu Mwirichia, director general of the
commission, said in the statement.  Regular petrol prices in the port city of  Mombasa , where
fuel products are offloaded, will rise 3.2 percent to 97.74
shillings a liter, the regulator said. In the western city of
Kisumu, Kenya’s third-largest city, the gasoline price will rise
2.8 percent to 103.10 shillings per liter, it said.  Kenyan inflation accelerated for the fourth consecutive
month to 6.5 percent in February after transport costs jumped 13
percent, the country’s National Bureau of Statistics said on
Feb. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
