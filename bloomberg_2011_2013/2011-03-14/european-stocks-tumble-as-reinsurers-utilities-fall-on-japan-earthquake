European stocks dropped for a
fourth day, led by a selloff in reinsurers and utilities, as  Japan  battles to prevent a nuclear meltdown following its
largest earthquake on record. Asian shares and U.S. futures
fell.  Swiss Reinsurance Co. and  Munich Re  both declined more than
3 percent after AIR Worldwide said the industry may face claims
of as much as 2.8 trillion yen ($34 billion). E.ON AG and RWE AG
slipped 2.6 percent and 2.8 percent respectively after officials
in China and India and U.S. lawmakers called for a review of
atomic energy plans.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.6 percent to 273.78 at
8:05 a.m. in  London , extending last week 2.3 percent selloff.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank 2.8 percent and the Nikkei 225
Stock Average plunged the most since 2008. Standard & Poorâ€™s 500
Index futures slid 0.6 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
