Brazilian homebuilders extended a
so-called  bear market  as  Cyrela Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos
e Participacoes (CYRE3)  tumbled after cutting its sales forecasts,
adding to concerns that rising borrowing costs will hurt housing
demand.  Cyrela,  Brazil ’s biggest real-estate company by revenue,
fell the most since October 2009, dropping 6.5 percent to 15.15
reais at the 4:15 p.m. New York time close. The  BM&FBovespa Real
Estate (IMOBBV)  Index slipped 0.5 percent to 908.90 and is down 21
percent from an October high. The measure first entered a bear
market, defined as a drop of at least 20 percent, on Jan. 28.  Homebuilders are leading declines on the benchmark Bovespa
index this year, with Cyrela down 30 percent, as accelerating
inflation spurs the central bank to increase borrowing costs.
Policy makers raised the benchmark interest rate twice since
January to 11.75 percent, and will boost it to 12.5 percent this
year, according to a central bank survey published today.  Cyrela slashed its forecast for sales this year by 8.3
percent to a maximum of 7.7 billion reais ($4.6 billion), and
next year by 17 percent to as much as 8.9 billion reais,
according to March 11 and November 2009 regulatory filings. The
reductions were greater than estimated by Credit Suisse Group
AG.  ‘Superior Size’  “Cyrela has been long regarded as the benchmark in the
sector, given its superior size and leading profitability track
record,” Marcello Milman, an analyst at Credit Suisse in  Sao
Paulo , wrote in a note to clients yesterday. “The new guidance
shows Cyrela growing less and with lower margins.”  The company also cut its estimates for margins on earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to a range
of 15 percent to 19 percent this year, and 18 percent to 22
percent in 2012. That compares to a previous forecast for both
years of 20 percent to 24 percent. Credit Suisse said the cuts
were a surprise.    Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3) , the sixth-biggest Brazilian
homebuilder, dropped 0.6 percent to 13.52 reais, paring a loss
of as much as 4 percent intraday.  Gafisa SA (GFSA3) , the third-biggest,
fell 1.2 percent to 10.15 reais after earlier slipping 3.3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
