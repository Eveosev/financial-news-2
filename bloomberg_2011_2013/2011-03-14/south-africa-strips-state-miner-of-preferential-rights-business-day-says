South African Mineral Resources
Minister Susan Shabangu stripped preferential rights granted to
African Exploration Mining & Finance Corp., the state-owned
mining company, Business Day said.  All exemptions given to the company during a power crisis
in 2008, which were aimed at accelerating prospecting and mining
rights to African Exploration, will be withdrawn in a Government
Gazette to be published today, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
cited the department as saying.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
