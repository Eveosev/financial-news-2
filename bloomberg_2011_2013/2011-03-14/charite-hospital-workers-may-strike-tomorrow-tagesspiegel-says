About 10,000 workers at the Charite
hospital in Berlin may strike tomorrow morning at 6 a.m. as the
Ver.di services union calls for work to halt,  Der Tagesspiegel 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Ver.di wants an increase of 300 euros ($420) per month for
nurses and technicians at the hospital, the German newspaper
reported today in an article that will be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
