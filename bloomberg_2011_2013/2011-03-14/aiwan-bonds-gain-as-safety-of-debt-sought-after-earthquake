  Taiwan ’s government bonds gained
for a fourth day, the longest winning streak since Feb. 15,
before an auction of NT$40 billion ($1.4 billion) of 10-year
debt today.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell to the lowest
level in more than two weeks as investors sought the relative
safety of debt on concern the earthquake and tsunami in  Japan 
will slow the global economic recovery. Taiwan’s dollar
strengthened for the first time in three days.  “Short sellers canceled their positions and bought back
bonds before the auction,” said  Albert Lee , a fixed-income
trader at Cathay United Bank in Taipei. “Uncertainty in the
stock market brought by the earthquake also prompted investors
to buy bonds.” In short selling, investors borrow bonds and
sell them, expecting the price will fall and the debt can be
replaced at a lower cost.  The yield on the 1.375 percent bond due March 2021 fell one
basis point to 1.39 percent as of 10:22 a.m. in Taipei,
according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the lowest level
since Feb. 24.  Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.2 percent to NT$29.551 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched a
one-week low of NT$29.642 on March 11.  “There’s too much uncertainty in the market after Japan’s
earthquake,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange
trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank. The currency will
trade between $NT29.50 and $NT29.60 this week, he predicted. “I
can see it going weaker from the current level.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
