Iranian and Chinese officials will
sign a $2 billion agreement for the construction of a dam and a
power plant in  Iran ’s western province of Lorestan,  Press TV 
reported.  The agreement will be signed between Sinohydro Corp.,
China’s largest water projects developer, and Iran’s  Farab , the
state-run news channel said, citing Mohammad Reza Rezazadeh, the
managing director of Iran’s Water and Power Resources
Development Co.  The contract will be completed this week and operations are
to start in the next Iranian calendar year, which starts on
March 21, according to the report, published on Press TV’s
website today.  The dam, to be built on the Bakhtiari river in the Zagros
mountains, will hold Iran’s largest reservoir, with a capacity
of 4.8 billion cubic meters of water, and support a 1,500-
megawatt hydroelectric power station, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
