Carbon permits under the European
Union’s emissions-trading system, the world’s biggest cap-and-
trade program, advanced to a five-month high as natural-gas
prices jumped.  EU allowances for December 2011 delivery rose as much as 45
euro cents to 16.18 euros a metric ton, the highest since Oct.
11, on  London ’s ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. The contract traded
at 16.12 euros as of 9:51 a.m. in London.  U.K. natural gas for delivery in the summer, the six months
through September, jumped as much as 7.6 percent on ICE. It’s
not immediately clear how much of the liquefied natural gas
bound for the EU can be diverted to  Japan , said Mark Lewis, an
analyst for Deutsche Bank AG in Paris. “It’s definitely having
an impact” on carbon prices today, he said today by phone.
“It’s too early to say how sustained this move in natural gas
in Europe is.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
