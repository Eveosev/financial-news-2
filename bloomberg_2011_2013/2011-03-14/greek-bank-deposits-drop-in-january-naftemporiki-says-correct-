(Corrects to show estimated drop in first paragraph is for
the whole of 2011.)  Greek bank deposits held by
businesses and households may fall as much as 15 billion euros
($21 billion) this year as the countryâ€™s economy contracts and
incomes decline,  Naftemporiki  reported, citing estimates from
bankers.  Deposits dropped by 4 billion euros in January, the Athens-
based newspaper said, without saying where it got the
information.  Deposits were little changed in December at 208.8 billion
euros compared with 208.9 billion euros in November, according
to a Bank of Greece statement on Feb. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
