The sale of 50 billion euros ($69.7
billion) worth of state-owned assets is very ambitious and faces
legal and social obstacles along with opposition from Greek
unions,  Ta Nea  reported, citing an interview with Greek Defense
Minister Evangelos Venizelos.  Venizelos said instead of selling state-owned land, shares
could be sold in holding companies that would develop state-
owned properties, the Athens-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
