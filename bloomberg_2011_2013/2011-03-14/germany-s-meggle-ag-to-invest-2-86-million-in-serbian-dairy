  Germany ’s Meggle AG, the parent to
a group of companies active within the dairy field, will invest
almost $3 million to develop  Serbia ’s Mladost dairy, which it
formally took over today, Beta news agency cited its chief
executive officer Sil van der Ploeg as saying today.  Meggle will invest 210 million dinars ($2.86 million) to
expand capacity and prepare the dairy based in Kragujevac, about
110 kilometers south of Belgrade, to also produce its own brand
and sell it to the markets of neighboring Montenegro and
Macedonia. Van der Ploeg did not disclose the price Meggle paid
in December for the 100 percent stake in Mladost, Beta said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
