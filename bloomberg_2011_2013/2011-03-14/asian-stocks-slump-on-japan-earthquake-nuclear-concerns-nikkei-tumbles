Asian stocks fell, sending a
regional benchmark  stock index  toward its steepest drop since
June, as Japan worked to contain a nuclear accident following
the nation’s biggest  earthquake .  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s No. 1 publicly
traded bank, slid 7.2 percent in  Tokyo  after police said the
death toll from the  earthquake  and ensuing tsunami may top
10,000. Canon Inc. sank 5.9 percent. Australian uranium
producers tumbled in Sydney as Japan worked to prevent a
meltdown at damaged nuclear reactors. Caltex  Australia  Ltd., the
nation’s biggest oil refiner, rose 2.6 percent on expectations
of increased Japanese demand for refined fuel.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index fell 2.7 percent to 131.38 as
of 7:45 p.m. in Tokyo, headed for its steepest drop since June 7
and lowest close since Dec. 1. Nine of the 10 industry groups on
the gauge declined, led by utilities stocks. Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY) 
Stock Average led declines, falling the most in two years. A
measure of Asian stocks traded outside of Japan rose.  “When you have the market the size of Japan down this much,
it’s going to affect everybody,” said  Stephen Halmarick ,
Sydney-based head of investment markets research at Colonial
First State Global Asset Management, which oversees about $150
billon. “A tragedy of this proportion is going to take up a lot
of economic resources. It’s going to have quite a negative
impact on growth.”  The Nikkei 225 dropped 6.2 percent in Tokyo. Most stocks
were initially unable to begin trading at the Tokyo open as sell
orders overwhelmed those to buy. Tokyo Electric Power Co.,
Asia’s biggest power company battling to avoid a meltdown at its
Fukushima nuclear plant, tumbled 24 percent. Toshiba Corp., a
maker of nuclear reactors plunged 16 percent.  Economic Resources  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 0.4 percent in
Sydney.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index climbed 0.4 percent and
South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  gained 0.8 percent in  Seoul , reversing
earlier losses of as much as 1.4 percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific
excluding Japan Index rose 0.4 percent, with about the same
number of stocks rising as falling.  “Markets were already in a corrective mode and the tragic
events in Japan have provided a further impetus,” said Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-based strategist at AMP Capital Investors Ltd.,
which manages about $98 billion. “While in human terms this is
a terrible disaster, I don’t see any significant lasting impact
on investor sentiment or global growth.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.4
percent today. In  New York , the index advanced 0.7 percent on
March 11, as gains in fuel, metal and industrial companies
helped the market overcome a global slump following  Japan ’s
earthquake.  The 8.9-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami may
have killed 10,000 people in Miyagi prefecture north of Tokyo,
local police said. The official toll reached 1,627 dead, with
1,720 more missing and 1,962 injured, the National Police Agency
said. More than 350,000 people are in emergency shelters.  Radiation Levels  Workers battled to prevent a nuclear meltdown after a
second hydrogen explosion rocked the Tokyo Electric Power Co.
station in Fukushima, 135 miles north of the capital today.  Tokyo Electric Power will start service outages in parts of
the greater Tokyo area today, according to a statement. The
biggest supplier of electricity in the capital will divide its
service area into five groups, each with three-hour outages from

was ready to unleash “massive” liquidity starting today in
Tokyo to assure financial stability.  ‘Worst Crisis’  “Our country faces its worst crisis since the end of the
war 65 years ago,” Prime Minister Naoto Kan said at a

Holdings Inc., the nation’s largest property and casualty
insurer by market value, fell 12 percent to 2,200 yen.  Canon, the world’ biggest camera maker, slid 5.9 percent to
3,575 yen. Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor
Co. all retreated after Japan’s three-largest carmakers said
thousands of new vehicles were damaged.  In Sydney, Paladin Energy Ltd. led declines in Australian
uranium companies as damage to Japanese nuclear power plants
prompted concern the disaster will hurt demand for reactor fuel.
Paladin tumbled 16 percent to A$3.95.  Energy Resources of
Australia Ltd. (ERA)  dropped 12 percent to A$8.25, while Extract
Resources Ltd. slipped 7.7 percent to A$9.81.  Following the tragedy, “I expect a weaker tone to pervade
Asian markets,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1
billion at Pengana Capital Ltd. in  Melbourne . “The uncertainty
about the ultimate impact of Friday’s earthquake and tsunami are
likely to see investors adopt a cautious stance.”  Japanese Builders  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 1.9 percent this year
through March 11, compared with a gain of 3.7 percent by the  S&P
500  and a drop of 0.1 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.

furnaces at its Kashima steel plant near Tokyo were suspended.
Citic Pacific Ltd., a steelmaker and property developer, rose
4.8 percent to HK$21.90 in Hong Kong, while Baoshan Iron & Steel
Co. advanced 2.1 percent to 7.22 yuan in  Shanghai .  Korean Stocks  South Korean oil refiners, automakers, and steel mills rose
in Seoul on speculation they’ll boost sales as Japanese rivals
halt production at plants damaged by the earthquake.  Hyundai
Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea’s biggest automaker, advanced 1.6 percent
to 185,500 won in Seoul, while  Posco (005490) , South Korea’s biggest
steelmaker surged 8.3 percent to 488,000.  “Supply disruptions by Japanese companies seem inevitable,
and demand for Korean-made products may increase,” analysts at
Hyundai Securities Co., led by Lee Sang Won, wrote in a report
today.  SK Innovation Co., an oil refiner, gained 6.7 percent to
198,500 won as Japanese companies including JX Nippon Oil &
Energy Corp. and Cosmo Oil Co. cut back capacity. Caltex climbed
2.6 percent to A$15.20 in Sydney.  “While always a terrible human tragedy, the economic
impacts of these sorts of events is usually not as bad as they
first appear,” said James Holt, Sydney-based director of
BlackRock Investment Management (Australia) Ltd., which oversees
about $40 billion in assets. “Once the disaster has passed,
economies often receive a boost from reconstruction activity.
What’s different this time is that nuclear power plants are in
trouble, which adds a new element of risk.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
