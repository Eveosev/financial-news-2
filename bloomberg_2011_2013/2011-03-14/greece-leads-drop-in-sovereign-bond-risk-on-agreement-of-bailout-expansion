  Europe ’s peripheral governments led
a decline in the cost of insuring the region’s debt, after
leaders agreed to expand the rescue fund for indebted nations.  Credit-default swaps on  Greece  tumbled 94 basis points to
949, while contracts on Italy fell 19 to 161,  Portugal  dropped
39 to 484 and  Spain  declined 23 to 234, according to CMA. The
Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of 15 governments was 11
basis points lower at 177.5, the biggest drop in five weeks.  European Union policy makers agreed to widen the scope of
their 440 billion-euro ($614 billion) bailout fund and ease
terms of Greek rescue loans. Swaps widened ahead of the meeting
on speculation agreement wouldn’t be reached before a March
24-25 summit, where the measures are now due for final approval.  “The EU leaders have pulled a few rabbits out of the
hat,”  Jim Reid , head of fundamental strategy at Deutsche Bank
AG in London, wrote in a note to investors. “It’s by no means a
gamechanger and there is event risk leading up to the summit and
quite a few things to nail down.”  The euro gained and bonds of the most-indebted nations
rallied, reversing a slump last week that sent yields on Greek
and Portuguese debt to euro-area records.  “This is purely a relief rally,” said Jeroen Van Den Broek, a strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “They’ve
delivered what the market was expecting but not much more than
that.”  Swaps on Ireland bucked the trend, rising 7 basis points to
606. Officials rejected Ireland’s bid for lower borrowing costs
for bailout loans as Prime Minister  Enda Kenny  refused to yield
to calls to raise its 12.5 percent company tax rate.  The cost of insuring the nation’s senior bank debt rose on
concern the government may force burden sharing if agreement on
easing the terms of the bailout can’t be reached.  Allied Irish  Swaps on Allied Irish Banks Plc jumped about 2 percentage
points to 23.6 percent upfront and five percent a year, meaning
it costs 2.36 million euros in advance and 500,000 euros
annually to insure 10 million euros of debt for five years. Bank
of Ireland Plc rose 1.7 percentage points to 17.5 percent
upfront.  Contracts on Bahrain soared 22 basis points to 312.5 as
lawmakers urged King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa to impose martial
law to stamp out protests after escalating clashes between
police and demonstrators yesterday.  Default swaps on Tokyo Electric Power Co., which is
battling to avoid a meltdown at its Fukushima nuclear plant
following a hydrogen explosion triggered by  Japan ’s biggest
earthquake on record, soared more than 221 percent to 134 basis
points, according to CMA.  Power Companies  Contracts on Europe’s gas and power companies fell.  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  dropped 20 basis points to 138,  Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS) 
tumbled 23 to 172 and EDP-Energias de Portugal SA fell 19 to
278, according to CMA.  The cost of insuring European bank bonds also fell, with
the Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks and insurers 8.5
basis points lower at 157 and the subordinated index down 8 to
276, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 7 basis points to 390 and
the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings declined 2.25 to 101.25, JPMorgan prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
