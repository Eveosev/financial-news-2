The  Bank of Japan  added a total of
8 trillion yen ($98 billion) to the financial system in one-day
operations today to help ease liquidity.  The central bank also said it will offer to buy 2 trillion
yen in Japanese  government bonds  through repurchases from
March 17 to the next day. Separately, the bank said it will
supply 5 trillion yen to the system from March 17 to April 18
and another 5 trillion yen from March 16 to March 23.  “While financial institutions are relying on the BOJ’s
operations, the latest injections don’t seem to be necessary
because calm may be gradually returning,” Shinsuke Kanabu, a
project and research director at Tokyo-based money market dealer
and broker Central Tanshi Co.  The central bank unleashed a record 15 trillion yen in one-
day operations yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
