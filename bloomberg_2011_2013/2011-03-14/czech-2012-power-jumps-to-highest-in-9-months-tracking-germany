Czech power for delivery in 2012
rose to the highest price in almost nine months, tracking
contracts in  Germany  on speculation that production of
electricity from nuclear plants may be curbed.  Czech year-ahead power increased 3 percent to 52.40 euros
($73.10) a megawatt-hour, the highest level since June 30, 2010
as the German contract for 2012 rose 2.7 percent to 54.65,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Czech Republic  has 17,625 megawatts of capacity
installed, of which 3,760 megawatts is in nuclear power,
according to Bloomberg data. The country was exporting as much
as 1,284 megawatt-hours of electricity to Germany at midday
local time today, according to  Entsoe , the European Transmission
System Operators transparency platform.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  is set to suspend the
extension of the country’s nuclear power plants today as
officials re-examine safety standards in the wake of explosions
at Japanese reactors, Focus Online reported, citing unidentified
people close to the government.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including GFI
Group Inc., ICAP Plc, Spectron Group Ltd., Tradition and Tullett
Prebon Plc. Brokers handle the majority of trading in  Europe ’s
electricity markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
