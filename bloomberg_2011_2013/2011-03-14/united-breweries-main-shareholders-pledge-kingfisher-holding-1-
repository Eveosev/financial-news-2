The majority shareholders of  Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. (KAIR)  pledged 55.5 percent of  India ’s second-
biggest carrier, according to a stock exchange filing.  “This pledge is essentially a repledge,” said A.K. Ravi Nedungadi, chief financial officer of UB Group, parent of United
Breweries Holdings Ltd. that owns a majority stake in the
airline. “The existing pledges were to various banks
individually. We took the shares back, and now we have repledged
them to a consortium of banks.” Nedungadi declined to further
elaborate on the matter.  The airline’s board had approved a plan last year to
convert debt of as much as 13.6 billion rupees ($302 million)
into equity. The Bangalore-based carrier will allot redeemable
preference shares worth 5.75 billion rupees at 8 percent for 12
years to lenders, it said in a statement to the Bombay Stock
Exchange on Nov. 25. Another 7.8 billion rupees of debt would be
converted into compulsorily convertible shares at 7.5 percent.  The carrier rose 3.7 percent to 41.70 rupees on the Bombay
Stock Exchange before the announcement, compared with a 1.5
percent gain in the benchmark Sensitive Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
