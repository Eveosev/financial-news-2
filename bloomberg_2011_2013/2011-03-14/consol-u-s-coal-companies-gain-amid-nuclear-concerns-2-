  Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) , a coal and
natural gas producer, led U.S. coal companies higher on
speculation that the shutdown of Japanese nuclear reactors after
a record earthquake will lead to more use of the fuel.  Consol rose $2.26, or 4.7 percent, to $50.87 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) ,
the third-biggest U.S. coal company, gained $1.84, or 3.6
percent, to $52.93.  Massey Energy Co. (MEE) , the largest producer in
the central Appalachia region, jumped $1.49, or 2.5 percent, to
$61.12.  An 8.9-magnitude temblor struck Japan on March 11. Tokyo
Electric Power Co. is battling to avoid a meltdown at its
Fukushima power station, and other reactors were taken offline
following the quake.  “With the nuclear plants being down there’s some sentiment
that it would help tighten the coal market,” said Jim Rollyson,
an analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc. in Houston. “This
situation with the nuclear plants is sparking fears going back
to Chernobyl and that could lead to more coal-fired plants.
They’re not going to explode.”  The 1986 Chernobyl disaster in modern-day Ukraine was the
worst nuclear accident on record. It stopped nuclear plant
construction in the Soviet Union and Russia for two decades.    Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) , the largest U.S. coal producer,
advanced $2.13, or 3.4 percent, to $65.27.  Patriot Coal Corp. (PCX) ,
the fourth-largest eastern U.S. coal company, gained 36 cents,
or 1.6 percent, to $22.95.  Arch Coal Inc. (ACI) , the second-biggest
U.S. coal producer, increased 40 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$32.88.  To contact the reporters on this story:
