Coventry City, a second-tier
English soccer team, dismissed manager Aidy Boothroyd after the
club slipped to 19th in the 24-team division.  Coventry lost 1-0 at home to Hull two days ago. Itâ€™s seven
points above the three-team relegation zone.  Boothroyd, who previously managed Watford and Colchester,
joined Coventry last year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
