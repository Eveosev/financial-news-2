Peter Bofinger, a member of German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s council of economic advisers, said he
fears the  Japan  earthquake may deliver “a shock” to the global
economy,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing Bofinger.  So far, the impact on the global economy has been
manageable, as Japan’s share of global trade is only 4.5
percent, the newspaper said in an e-mailed preview of an article
to be published tomorrow. There is no reason to change the
growth forecast for Germany, Bofinger said, according to
Sueddeutsche.  To contact the reporter on this story:
