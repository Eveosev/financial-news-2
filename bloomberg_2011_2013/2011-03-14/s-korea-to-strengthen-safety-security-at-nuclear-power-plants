  South Korea , which depends on
nuclear energy for 33 percent of its electricity, said it will
improve safety and security at nuclear power plants as Japan
struggles to contain damaged at reactors caused by a record-
strong  earthquake .  Japan is seeking to avoid a meltdown at a power station in
Fukushima north of  Tokyo  by flooding reactors with water and
boric acid to eliminate the potential for a catastrophic release
of radiation into the atmosphere.  “Reactors in South Korea are safer than those in
Fukushima,” Ahn Hyun Ho, Vice Minister of Knowledge Economy,
told lawmakers in Seoul today. “Still, we will review and
improve the safety of nuclear power plants.” Ahn didn’t provide
details of the improvements.  South Korea has said it will construct more nuclear
reactors to cut reliance on fossil fuels including crude and
coal, and to diversify energy sources after  oil prices  in  New
York  climbed to a record $147.27 a barrel in 2008. Nuclear
plants will provide 59 percent of South Korea’s power generation
by 2030. The nation operates 21 reactors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
