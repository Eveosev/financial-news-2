Cuba’s central bank devalued one of
the island’s peso currencies to parity with the dollar in order
to stimulate exports and production and improve the country’s
balance of payments, the central bank said.  Cuba’s convertible peso, used by tourists and to buy
dollars for foreign trade transactions, is now worth $1, down
from about $1.08, according to a central bank  statement 
published in the Communist party newspaper Granma.  The convertible peso remains pegged to 24 standard pesos,
the currency in which most Cubans are paid. Tourists will still
be charged 10 percent when exchanging dollars for convertible
pesos, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
