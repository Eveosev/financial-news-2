The widow of Keith Blair Manuel,
one of 11 crew members who died in the April 20 explosion of the
Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, has settled her lawsuit against  BP Plc. (BP/)  Terms of the settlement weren’t disclosed.  U.S. District Judge  Carl Barbier  of  New Orleans  today
agreed to dismiss Melinda Anne Becnel’s suit against BP, which
hired the rig to drill a subsea well that blew out off the
Louisiana coast last year, causing the worst marine oil spill in
U.S. history.  Becnel’s claims against BP’s partners in the well and other
oilfield contractors involved in the project were also
dismissed.  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , owner of the Deepwater Horizon,
wasn’t a party to the suit. BP and the other companies involved
in the spill face more than 350 lawsuits from individuals and
businesses claiming economic and personal injury from the
explosion and spill.  The case is In re  Oil Spill  by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the  Gulf of Mexico  on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans).  To contact the reporters on this story:
