  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  Canada ’s
largest insurer, said it doesn’t expect property and casualty
claims related to the earthquake and tsunami in  Japan  to exceed
C$150 million ($154 million).  Claims related to Japan’s strongest earthquake aren’t
expected “to be material to full-year results,” the Toronto-
based insurer said today in a statement. All the company’s
employees and agents in the country are safe, it said.  Manulife shares fell 4.6 percent in trading on the Toronto
Stock Exchange since March 11, following the 8.9-magnitude
temblor and subsequent tsunami.  The loss range for Manulife may be 1 percent to 5 percent
of adjusted earnings from operations last year, or 2 cents to 8
cents a share, Peter Routledge, a National Bank Financial
analyst, wrote today in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
