Wall Street firms earned $1.1
billion in fiscal 2010 managing investments for the  California
Public Employees’ Retirement System , the largest U.S. pension.  The $228.2 billion fund spent $1.2 billion managing its
portfolio, with 90 percent dedicated to external asset
management fees, Janine Guillot, Calpers’s chief operating
investment officer, told the Calpers board in  Sacramento  today.  “External fees are by far our biggest cost category, so
it’s really important to continue to focus on managing those
expenses,” Guillot said.  Calpers earned a 13.3 percent return in fiscal 2010. That
followed a loss of 23.4 percent in the year that ended June 30,
2009, its worst one-year decline on record.  The goal for this year is to reduce fee costs, Guillot
said.  CIM Group LP , a Los Angeles real-estate investment
manager, last year agreed to cut fees it charges the fund by $50
million. Relational Investors LLC, the shareholder-activist fund
run by Ralph Whitworth, agreed last year to trim $30 million and
Los Angeles-based Ares Management LLC also agreed to cut fees by
$10 million.  The fund said 49 percent of the money it paid to asset
managers, or about $510 million, went to private-equity firms
such as  Carlyle Group  and Apollo Global Management LLC. Another
31 percent was spent with stock managers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
