Siberian Coal Energy Co. and OAO  Mechel (MTL) , Russian coal producers, may increase shipments to Japan
after an earthquake-generated tsunami smashed into nuclear
reactors in the country, threatening energy supply.  Siberian Coal Energy, known as SUEK, and  Mechel (MTLR)  are able to
boost deliveries if necessary, the two companies said today in
e-mailed statements. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin
said March 12 that Russia could increase coal exports to Japan
by 3 million to 4 million metric tons a year “quite quickly.”  Tokyo Electric Power Co. was today attempting to stabilize
three reactors damaged by the biggest earthquake in Japan’s
history after a second explosion rocked the Fukushima plant. No
large release of radiation was detected after the blast, which
didn’t breach the No. 3 reactor and followed a build-up of
hydrogen gas, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
