Univision Communications Inc.,
owner of the most-watched Spanish language TV network in the
U.S., said Executive Chairman  Haim Saban  will assume added
duties after the resignation of Chief Executive Officer Joe Uva.  Uva, 55, told the board he decided not to renew his
employment agreement in order to seek other opportunities, New
York-based Univision said today in a statement. The company
plans to seek a successor, according to the statement.  Saban, 66, is executive chairman of Univision and part of
the group that bought the company for $12.6 billion, a takeover
completed in March 2007. Saban is owner of the Power Rangers
brand and was reported on Feb. 11 to be considering a bid for
Hit Entertainment Ltd., owner of Thomas the Tank Engine.  Uva has been Univision’s CEO since April 2007. He
previously held positions with Omnicom Group Inc. and Time
Warner Inc.’s Turner Broadcasting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
