Provisions in the European bailout
plan for debt-stricken euro-area nations that were agreed to on
March 11 may harm investor demand for indebted nations’ bonds
after a “short-term” boost, according to Jefferies Group Inc.  “No European agreement would complete without a bashing of
private-sector creditors,” David Zervos, global head of fixed-
income strategy in  New York , wrote in an investor note received
today. He cited mentions of “haircuts, standstills, extension
of maturity and interest-rate cuts” from the  bailout plan .  “I’m not sure why the European leaders are so intent on
making sure no one will want to buy the periphery for the long
run,” he said.  Still, the package is a “huge step forward in the process
of fiscal unity” and “short term, we should get some gains for
the periphery, especially the front ends,” with German bunds
weakening, Zervos wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
