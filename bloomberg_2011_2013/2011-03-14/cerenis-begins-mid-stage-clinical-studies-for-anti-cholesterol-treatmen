Cerenis Therapeutics SA began mid-
stage clinical testing for its lead product candidate, a drug to
treat  heart disease  and high cholesterol.  The study, the second of three stages of research generally
needed for regulatory approval, will include more than 500
patients at 50 centers in the U.S., Canada and Europe, the
company, based in Toulouse, France, and  Ann Arbor , Michigan,
said in an e-mailed statement today.  The product, called CER-001, removes excess lipids from
tissues such as the arterial wall and eliminates them from the
body through the liver, according to the company. Lipids are
fatty substances such as cholesterol that are waxy or oily in
consistency. Lipids can clog arteries, a condition called
atherosclerosis.  Atherosclerosis  is the main cause of heart disease, the
world’s biggest killer. An estimated  17.1 million people  died
from cardiovascular diseases in 2004 worldwide, according to the
   World Health Organization .  Cerenis last year raised 50 million euros ($70 million) to
fund the drug’s development. Initial trial results of CER-001
showed “excellent safety and tolerability,” Chief Executive
Officer Jean-Louis Dasseux said in the statement.  The trial, dubbed Chi-Square, is being conducted along with
the Global Atherothrombotic Investigative Network and the
 Montreal Heart Institute , Cerenis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
