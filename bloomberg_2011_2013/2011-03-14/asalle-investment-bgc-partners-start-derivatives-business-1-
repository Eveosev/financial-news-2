The property fund of broker  Jones
Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL)  set up a real-estate derivatives business with
wholesale market broker BGC Partners Inc. to tap revived
interest in the financial instruments.  The focus will initially be on the U.K., growing to other
countries,  LaSalle Investment Management Inc.  said today in a
statement. It didn’t say how much business it expects to handle.  Investors want to put money into a combination of
derivatives and physical buildings, Alan Tripp, U.K. managing
director of  LaSalle Investment Management , said in the
statement.  “There appears to be appetite for this sort of diversified
strategy,” he said. “The market is developing and we want to
offer our clients the ability to access it.”  Trading in U.K. property derivatives declined in the wake
of losses during the global credit crisis. The value of trades
fell to 192 million pounds ($309 million) in the last quarter of
2010 from 731 million pounds in the prior three months,
according to research group Investment Property Databank Ltd.
The number of trades fell by a third to 52 from 78 over the
period.  A derivative is a financial obligation whose value depends
on  interest rates , the outcome of specific events, or the price
of underlying assets such as real estate, debt, equities,
commodities and currencies. Chicago-based Jones Lang LaSalle is
the world’s second-largest publicly traded property broker and
its property fund has $40 billion under management. BGC
Partners, based in  New York , is an interdealer broker that
separated from Cantor Fitzgerald LP in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
