  Aflac Inc. (AFL) , the biggest seller of
supplemental insurance, fired comedian Gilbert Gottfried, the
voice of its duck mascot in the U.S., after comments he made
about tsunami victims in Japan, the firm’s biggest market.  “Gilbert’s recent comments about the crisis in Japan were
lacking in humor and certainly do not represent the thoughts and
feelings of anyone at Aflac,” said Michael Zuna, senior vice
president and chief marketing officer, in a statement today from
the Columbus, Georgia-based insurer.  Gottfried posted messages on Twitter that made light of the
deadly flooding in Japan, the  Daily Mail  reported on its
website. Aflac launched the duck campaign in 2000 to elevate
awareness of its supplemental insurance, according to a July
2010 statement from the company. The duck had appeared in 50
television commercials, the insurer said at the time.  “Aflac will immediately set plans in motion to conduct a
nationwide casting call to find a new voice of the iconic Aflac
Duck,” the insurer said in today’s statement. “It should be
noted that Gilbert Gottfried is not the voice of the Aflac Duck
in  Japan .”  Tim Curtis and Ken DiCamillo, Gottfried’s talent agents at
William Morris Endeavor, weren’t immediately available to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
