Russia’s Primorsk port, which
handles more of the country’s sea-bound crude exports than any
other facility, expects all  oil tankers  stuck by ice last week
to leave the port by the end of the day.  Two tankers departed from the Baltic Sea facility
yesterday, a port official said today by phone, declining to be
named because he isn’t authorized to speak to the press. Four
more vessels are moving, helped by ice-breaking ships, he said.
On March 11, he said about a dozen ships were stuck.  Primorsk is due to handle 1.47 million barrels of crude
exports a day this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
