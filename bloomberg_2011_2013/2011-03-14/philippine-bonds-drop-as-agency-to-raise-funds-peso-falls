Philippine bonds dropped, with the
yield on three-year bonds climbing to a one-week high, as the
government unveiled plans for raising as much as 200 billion
pesos ($4.6 billion) to fund roads, railways, and ports.  The National Development Co., the country’s investment
agency, will probably sell debt to four state-owned financial
institutions that may, in turn, also sell securities, Economic
Planning Secretary Cayetano Paderanga said in an interview on
March 12. The peso fell as the  Bank of Japan  poured a record 12
trillion yen ($146 billion) into its economy to support markets
after the strongest earthquake in the nation’s history.  “Any additional borrowings will put some pressure on
yields,” said Antonio Espedido, a treasurer at China Banking
Corp. in Manila. “Demand for reconstruction in  Japan  could also
be inflationary.”  The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January 2014 climbed
2.5 basis points to 5.275 percent as of 10:17 a.m. in Manila,
the highest level since March 4, according to Tradition
Financial Services. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Philippine central bank will consider the impact of the
natural calamities that struck Japan to global trade and
inflation during its March 24 monetary policy meeting, Governor
Amando Tetangco said.  The Philippine peso fell for third day, losing 0.1 percent
to 43.71 per dollar in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter for this story:
