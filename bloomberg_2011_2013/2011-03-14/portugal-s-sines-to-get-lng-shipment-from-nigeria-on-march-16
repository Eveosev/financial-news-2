  Portugal ’s port of Sines is
scheduled to receive a shipment of liquefied natural gas from  Nigeria  on March 16.  The LNG Borno is sailing from Bonny in Nigeria, according
to the website of  Administracao do Porto de Sines SA , the port’s
management company.  The Sines LNG terminal, with a capacity of 5.26 billion
cubic meters of natural gas a year, is managed by REN-Redes
Energeticas Nacionais SA, the nation’s power and gas grid
operator. LNG is gas that’s cooled to a liquid for shipment by
tanker and then converted back to a gas at terminals for
distribution to users.    Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) , Portugal’s biggest oil and gas
company, receives LNG at Sines as well as gas from  Algeria 
through a pipeline crossing Morocco and Spain. Galp also
operates Portugal’s largest refinery at Sines. EDP-Energias de
Portugal SA, the country’s biggest power utility, runs a coal-
fired electricity plant at the site.  Other ships expected at Sines include Silia T, a tanker
carrying crude that’s sailing from Angra dos Reis in Brazil and
is scheduled to arrive at 10 p.m. tonight. Ice Transporter,
another tanker carrying crude, is sailing from Novorossiysk in
Russia and is due to arrive on March 18.  Sines is one of the European Union’s biggest deepwater
harbors, according to the port’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
