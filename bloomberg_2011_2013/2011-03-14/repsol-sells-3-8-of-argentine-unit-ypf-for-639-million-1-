  Repsol YPF SA (REP) ,  Spain ’s biggest oil
company, agreed to sell 3.83 percent in YPF for $639 million,
cutting its holding in the Argentine unit to 76 percent, and
said it plans to sell more shares through a public offering.  The company will sell a 2.9 percent stake to Lazard Asset
Management and 0.93 percent to other investors for $42.40 a
share, Madrid-based Repsol said today. A further 1.06 percent
stake was sold in the market in the last few months and Repsol
plans a public offering of as much as 7.1 percent of YPF through
a sale of American depositary shares.  “The sale of YPF shares is part of Repsol’s strategic goal
to rebalance its portfolio of assets,” the company said.  Repsol is seeking to reduce business in maturing fields in
 Argentina  while investing in exploration in  Brazil ’s offshore  Santos Basin  and elsewhere to increase output. Repsol in 2008
delayed a public offering of a stake in YPF, which produces and
processes about 50 percent of Argentina’s oil and controls about
half the domestic fuel market.  Repsol shares fell as much as 2.8 percent to 22.80 euros,
and traded at 22.93 at 5:02 p.m. in Madrid. They have climbed
9.9 percent this year, valuing the company at 28 billion euros
($39 billion).  Chief Executive Officer Antonio Brufau said in April last
year that Repsol aims to keep at least 51 percent of YPF. On
Dec. 23, the company agreed to sell 3.3 percent of YPF for $500
million to funds advised by Eton Park Capital Management,
Capital Guardian Trust Co. and Capital International Inc.  Argentine investor Sebastian Eskenazi, whose family bought
15 percent of YPF from Repsol for $2.2 billion in 2007, also has
an option to boost his interest to 25 percent by 2012.  Oil Output  Repsol’s oil and gas production, excluding YPF, fell 2.3
percent to 341,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the fourth
quarter as output at some fields dropped and because of
inspections at the Shenzi project in the U.S. Output from Buenos
Aires-based YPF fell 2.5 percent to 511,000 barrels a day
following an oil workers’ strike in southern  Argentina .  Repsol forecasts annual production growth of as much as 4
percent through 2014 as projects in  Brazil  and Peru start. It
plans to invest 28 billion euros from 2010 to 2014 on fields in
Venezuela, Bolivia and  Algeria . The company will invest about 6
billion euros this year and plans to drill 25 to 30 exploration
and evaluation wells, Repsol said last month.  The reserve replacement ratio rose to 131 percent last
year, meaning Repsol found more oil than it produced, up from 94
percent in 2009. The company has estimated a ratio of more than
110 percent in the next five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
