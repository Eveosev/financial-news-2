  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  has received a
proposal by shareholder Qatar that it make carbon fibers in the
country, as large amounts of energy needed for the process are
available at low cost there,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing
people close to the company.  Qatar may also take a direct stake in  SGL Carbon SE (SGL) , of
which Volkswagen owns 8.2 percent, the newspaper said, citing
people in the financial industry. The emirate hasnâ€™t
communicated such a plan, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
