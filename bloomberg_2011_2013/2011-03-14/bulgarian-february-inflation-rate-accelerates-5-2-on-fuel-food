Bulgaria’s inflation rate
accelerated in February to the highest in seven months as fuel
and food prices in the European Union’s poorest country rose.  The annual rate was 5.2 percent, after 4.5 percent in
January, the National Statistics Institute in Sofia said today
in a statement on its website. The median estimate of four
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a rate of 4.5 percent.
Prices climbed 1.2 percent in the month.  Bulgaria overshot the government’s 2010 inflation target of
3.2 percent as the country recovered from a recession and rising
global commodity prices pushed up food and transport costs. The
government forecast an average inflation rate of 3.6 percent for
this year. Factory-gate prices advanced an annual 11.1 percent
in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
