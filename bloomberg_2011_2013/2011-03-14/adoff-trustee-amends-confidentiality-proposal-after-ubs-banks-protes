The trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff’s defunct firm amended a confidentiality proposal that  UBS AG (UBSN)  said would give him “carte blanche” to disclose private
material to 4,000 parties including rival banks.  Trustee Irving H. Picard, who is fighting more than 1,000
lawsuits seeking $100 billion for investors in the  Ponzi scheme 
from 4,000 defendants, asked a judge to approve a modified
version of the proposal, according to a court filing.  Confidential information supplied by parties being sued
wouldn’t be -- and was never meant to be -- disclosed to all
defendants, and prior agreements to keep information private
would be honored, Picard said in the filing today in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  UBS objected earlier this month that under Picard’s new
rules, names and account numbers of Madoff customers, amounts of
withdrawals, redemptions, transfers and transferees would lose
their protection, making confidentiality “entirely illusory.”  The Swiss wealth manager’s protest was one of at least
eight objections filed in court on March 2 by banks and
investment managers including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup
Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc.  A hearing on Picard’s amended proposal is set for March 31.  The UBS case is Picard v. UBS AG, 10-ap-4285,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
