Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in  New
York , the Gulf Coast and California strengthened on speculation
that lower refinery capacity in Japan will tighten supplies
following last week’s earthquake.  “Japan will not be exporting diesel and that supply has to
be made up from somewhere,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow
Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Gulf Coast
rose 1.25 cents to 4.38 cents a gallon versus heating oil
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:09 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
4.94 cents to $3.1097 a gallon.  The same fuel in New York rose 0.5 cent against futures to
8.75 cents a gallon.  JX Holdings Inc. said oil production at JX Nippon Oil &
Energy Corp.’s Sendai, Kashima and Negishi refineries was halted
today. The nation’s refinery utilization may fall to about 65
percent from 88 percent before the March 11 quake, Edinburgh-
based Wood Mackenzie Consultants Ltd. said in a report on its
website.    Japan  exported about 2,000 barrels a day of ULSD to the
U.S. last year, according to the Energy Department.  The premium for California-blend diesel fuel in  San
Francisco  strengthened 4.5 cents to 19.5 cents versus Nymex
heating oil. The same fuel in  Los Angeles  gained 2.75 cents to
20.5 cents a gallon, the highest level since May 6, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
