  Azerbaijan â€™s oil and natural gas
production fell during the first two months of 2011 compared
with the same period last year, the State Statistics Committee
said in a report on its website.  Oil output over January and February combined fell to 7.9
million metric tons, 1.3 percent less than a year earlier, while
natural gas production was 4.1 billion cubic meters over the
two-month period, down 2.4 percent, the committee said today,
