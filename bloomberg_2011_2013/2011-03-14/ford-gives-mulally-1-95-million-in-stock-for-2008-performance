  Ford Motor Co. (F)  awarded Chief
Executive Officer  Alan Mulally  $1.95 million in stock one week
after granting him $56.5 million in shares, the company said
yesterday in a federal filing.  Mulally’s latest award, which came as stock grants that
vested March 11, was for his performance in 2008, when the
second-largest U.S. automaker had a record $14.8 billion loss.
His 2010 salary and benefits will be released in a proxy report
in the coming weeks, said  John Stoll , a company spokesman.  “Alan Mulally’s leadership has been widely recognized as
extraordinary,” Stoll said in an interview yesterday. “His
compensation reflects Ford’s goal of retaining a world-class
CEO.”  Mulally, who came to Ford from  Boeing Co. (BA)  in 2006, has
turned around the automaker by emphasizing quality and expanding
its lineup with small cars such as the Fiesta subcompact. Ford
earned $9.28 billion in the last two years after $30.1 billion
in losses from 2006 through 2008. The shares, which traded as
low as $1.01 on Nov. 20, 2008, fell 6 cents to $14.30 yesterday
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  As a reward for the turnaround, Ford on March 3 paid
Mulally unrestricted stock worth $56.5 million and gave
Executive Chairman Bill Ford unrestricted shares valued at $42.4
million. Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford withheld some of the
stock awards to cover their income taxes. After taxes, Mulally
received $33.4 million and  Bill Ford  got $25.1 million.  Ford also withheld some stock from Mulally’s 2008 award to
cover income taxes, leaving him with $1.16 million after taxes.  “Had Ford not achieved such strong results, the value of
stock grants would have been much lower or possibly would not
have paid out at all,” Stoll said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
