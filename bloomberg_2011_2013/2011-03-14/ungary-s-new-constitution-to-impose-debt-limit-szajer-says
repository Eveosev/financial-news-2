Hungary’s new constitution will
impose “strict” rules to guarantee a gradual decline in the
state’s debt and make public finances “sustainable,” said
Jozsef Szajer, a ruling party deputy in the European Parliament.  The government won’t be allowed to take loans or
liabilities which increase debt from the previous year or push
it above 50 percent of the previous year’s gross domestic
product, according to a draft constitution posted on
parliament’s  website  today.  Hungary, the European Union’s most indebted eastern member,
was the first in the bloc to obtain a bailout led by the  International Monetary Fund  in 2008. Seeking to avoid a credit
rating downgrade to junk, Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  on
March 1 presented a plan to cut spending and delay tax cuts
which he said will help reduce debt to less than 70 percent of
output in 2013 and below 60 percent in 2016.  “We are not saying debt will have to reach 50 percent by
next week, because then the country would suddenly collapse,”
Szajer said. “We are saying it will have to go downward. We
chose a version which imposes quite strong and strict limits on
indebtedness.”  Further legislation will be needed to specify how fast debt
will have to fall to 50 percent from the current 80 percent and
whether it will be measured in forint, euros or dollars, Szajer,
who has led preparations of the new constitution, told
reporters.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  set an April deadline for
parliament to approve the text of the new constitution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
