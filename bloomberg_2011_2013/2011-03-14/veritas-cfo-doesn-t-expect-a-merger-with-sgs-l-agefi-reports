  Bureau Veritas SA (BVI)  doesn’t expect to
merge with  SGS SA (SGSN) ,  L’Agefi  reported, citing Francois Tardan,
chief financial officer of the inspection company.  The two companies are very different and the cost savings
wouldn’t be worth the price of integrating them, Tardan told the
Lausanne-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
