Makoto Yamashita, chief rates
strategist in  Tokyo  at Deutsche Securities, a unit of Deutsche
Bank AG, comments on the Bank of  Japan ’s meeting today and the
impact on bonds from the nation’s strongest earthquake on
record.  “The BOJ is providing ample liquidity, and bond yields
mainly in short- and medium-term zones are declining sharply
amid speculation there may be more easing at today’s monetary
policy meeting.”  “Concerns over fiscal risks and an increase in debt sales
are weighing on longer-term bonds. Investors are reluctant to
buy super-long notes ahead of a 20-year bond auction. The yield
curve will likely steepen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
