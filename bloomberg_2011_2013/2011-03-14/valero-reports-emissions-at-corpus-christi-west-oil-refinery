  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  had emissions
from a cooling tower at its  Corpus Christi  West refinery in
Texas.  An exchanger leaked into a cooling tower, causing
emissions from the tower, according to a filing with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality. The incident started at
5:50 a.m. local time and ended at 3:20 p.m., the filing said.  “The leak was in a cooling tower,” Valero spokesman Bill Day said in an e-mail. “There was no material impact to
production.”  The refinery consists of east and west plants about a mile
apart with a capacity of about 315,000 barrels a day, the
company said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
