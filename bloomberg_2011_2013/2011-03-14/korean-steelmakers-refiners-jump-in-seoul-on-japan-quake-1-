  Posco (005490) , South Korea’s biggest
steelmaker, jumped by the most since 2008 in Seoul trading,
while oil refiner SK Innovation Co. rose the most in almost
eight months after the strongest earthquake on record in  Japan 
disrupted output at steel mills and refineries.  Posco, the world’s third-largest by output, rose 8.3
percent to close at 488,000 won on the Korea Exchange, the
biggest gain since November 2008, while the benchmark Kospi
stock index increased 0.8 percent. SK Innovation, the nation’s
biggest refiner, advanced 6.7 percent to 198,500 won, the most
since July 22.  “Supply disruptions at Japanese mills are boosting Korean
steel stocks,” said Kim Gyung Jung, steel and metals analyst
with Seoul-based Eugene Investment & Securities Co. “Reduced
supplies from Japanese makers should help improve steel prices,
and raw material prices can also come down as there should be
less need for iron ore in Japan, benefiting Korean
steelmakers.”  Nippon Steel Corp. and JFE Holdings Inc., Japan’s top
steelmakers, restarted blast furnaces at their factories near  Tokyo  after a halt triggered by the earthquake.  Sumitomo Metal
Industries Ltd. (5405) , the third largest, won’t likely resume
operations at its Kashima plant north of Tokyo “for a while”
as the quake damaged blast furnaces and other facilities,
Chairman Hiroshi Shimozuma told reporters in Osaka. Kashima
produces about half Sumitomo’s crude steel output, forecast to
be 13.5 million metric tons this fiscal year.    Hyundai Steel Co. (004020) , South Korea’s second-biggest maker of
the metal, advanced 10 percent to 136,000 won, the biggest gain
since December 2008, and Dongkuk Steel Mill Co. soared 13
percent to 37,750 won, gaining the most since April 12.  Production Disrupted  Production at six steel plants, which account for as much
as 22 percent of Japan’s annual output, may have been disrupted,
according to Hyundai Securities Co. As Japan provides more than
30 percent of  South Korea ’s annual steel imports, production
losses will affect steel supply and demand conditions in Korea,
it said.  An electricity shortage after nuclear  power plants  were hit
by the 8.9-magnitude temblor that shook buildings across Tokyo
and unleashed a seven-meter-high tsunami that engulfed towns on
the northern coast could prolong disruptions at industrial
factories in Japan, Eugene’s Kim said.  Japanese companies including JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp.
and Cosmo Oil Co. have shut more than 820,000 barrels a day of
capacity, or about 19 percent of the country’s total processing
ability. That will reduce the supply of refined products such as
diesel and gasoil, or middle distillates, available for export
from the country, the third-largest crude consumer.  Korean Refiners  “Refining margins may rise with Japanese facilities
suspending operations, which should benefit Korean refiners,”
Lee Jae Hun, an analyst with Mirae Asset Securities Co., wrote
in a report dated March 11.    GS Holdings (078930)  Corp., the parent of South Korea’s second-
biggest oil refiner, gained 8.3 percent to 83,400 won, the
biggest advance since December 2008, and  S-Oil Corp. (010950)  jumped 13
percent to 140,000 won, rising by the most since February 2004.  A potential shortage of naphtha will lower the operating
ratio of Japanese chemical facilities, while a power shortage
and port shutdowns are likely to delay petrochemical shipments
from Japan, reducing supply in the region, Dongbu Securities Co.
analysts led by Lee Min Hee said in a note today.    LG Chem Ltd. (051910) , South Korea’s biggest chemicals maker, gained
5.4 percent to 409,500 won, the most since Jan. 5, while  Honam
Petrochemical Corp. (011170)  jumped 11 percent to 385,000 won, the
biggest increase since January 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
