  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , India’s largest
mobile-phone operator, and  Punj Lloyd Ltd. (PUNJ) , an engineering
company, didn’t renew offers to buy the government’s stake in a
wireless services provider in the northwestern state of
Rajasthan.  Both companies said in separate statements today they
exited from the bid after the government’s stake sale in Bharti
Hexacom Ltd. took longer than expected. Their offers expired
March 13. Bharti owns 70 percent of the company, while the
government holds the rest.  “It was due to procedural delays as the government has to
fix a reserve price on” the sale of stake in Hexacom, said K.B.
Batra, director, finance at  Telecommunications Consultants India
Ltd. , which holds the stake in the Bharti unit. “It took time
in examining it.”  Bharti, which bought Hexacom from  India ’s Shyam Group seven
years ago, has been trying to buy the remaining stake in the
unit since 2006, when it first bid to buy out the government.  “The process of disinvestment of 30 percent holding of
TCIL in Bharti Hexacom had been initiated by the government
several times,” according to Bharti’s statement. “Due to
procedural issues the  process has not culminated into finality.
Bharti Airtel therefore has decided not to extend the bank
guarantee and the offer to buy 30 percent equity.”  Punj Lloyd’s aim to buy the stake was to make a
“significant gain” by investing in Hexacom for a short time,
spokeswoman Louise Sharma said in an e-mailed statement.  Hexacom also offers services in northeastern Indian states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
