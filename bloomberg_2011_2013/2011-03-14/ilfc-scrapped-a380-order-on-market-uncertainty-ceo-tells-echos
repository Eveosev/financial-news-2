International Lease Finance Corp.
scrapped an order of 10 Airbus SAS A380 superjumbo jets because
of uncertainty about the secondary market for the aircraft,  Les
Echos  reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive
Officer Henri Courpron.  ILFC has orders for a first lease of A380 planes, “but no
visibility” for 10 or 12 years thereafter, Courpron said,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
