Economists covering the Brazilian
economy cut their growth forecast for next year for the first
time in 12 months on bets that policy makers will need to slow
the economy to cool inflation running at a 26-month high.    Brazil ’s gross domestic product will expand 4.45 percent
next year, down from a week-earlier forecast of 4.5 percent,
according to the median forecast in a March 11  central bank
survey  of about 100 economists published today. The economists
also cut their 2011 GDP growth forecast for a third straight
week, to 4.1 percent from 4.29 percent the previous week, the
survey found.  Consumer prices will rise 5.82 percent this year, compared
with a week-earlier forecast of 5.78 percent. Inflation
expectations for 2012 were unchanged at 4.80 percent. The
central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus two
percentage points.  “Inflation is too high,” said Gustavo Rangel, chief
Brazil economist for ING Financial Markets in  New York . “The
government will have to slow down the economy materially to
bring it back to the target.”  Traders are reducing bets on interest rate increases after
the central bank signaled it may resort to additional “macro-
prudential” measures to curb credit growth. The yield on the
interest rate futures contract maturing in 2012 fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 12.32 percent at 8:34 a.m.
New York time. The yield fell 22 basis points last week.  Higher Rate  The central bank will increase the benchmark interest rate
50 basis points to 12.25 percent at its April 19-20 policy
meeting, the survey found, unchanged from last week. The pace of
rate rises this year will depend on whether the bank announces
further credit curbs, Rangel said. At their March meeting,
policy makers raised the rate 50 basis points for a second
straight meeting.  The central bank said credit curbs are a “rapid and
potent” method to contain demand, according to minutes of its
March 1-2 policy meeting, published March 10. The bank raised
reserve and capital requirements in December to prevent a credit
bubble. Economists estimate the higher  reserve requirements  will
have the same impact on inflation as a 75 basis-point increase
in the benchmark rate, according to a central bank survey
released Feb. 24.  Annual inflation quickened to 6.01 percent in February, the
fastest pace since November 2008. Inflation will start slowing
from the fourth quarter of this year, and will be “slightly”
below the target by the end of next year, the bank said in the
minutes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
