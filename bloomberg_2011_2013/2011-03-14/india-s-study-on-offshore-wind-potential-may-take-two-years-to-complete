India may take two years to study
and gather data on the potential for offshore  wind energy , a
minister said.  Preliminary studies indicate that coastal areas off Tamil
Nadu and Gujarat states may have potential, Farooq Abdullah,
minister of new and renewable energy, said in a written reply to
questions in parliament.  The results from the studies need to be validated by
setting up offshore masts to measure one to two years of wind
speed data and by analyzing the seabed to see if it can provide
an adequate foundation for offshore wind projects, he said.  India is planning two pilot offshore wind farms,  Deepak
Gupta , secretary at the ministry of new and renewable energy,
said in an interview on Feb. 17.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp.,  India ’s biggest explorer, is
helping the government to analyze the data and the UN’s Risoe
Centre on Energy, Climate & Sustainable Development is helping
to carry out an offshore wind resources assessment in Chennai,
Abdullah said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
