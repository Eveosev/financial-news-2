Rebels in the  Ivory Coast  who back  Alassane Ouattara  as the nation’s elected leader said they took
control of a fourth town in the western cocoa-growing region, as
residents reported fighting in the commercial capital, Abidjan.  The New Forces insurgents drove out forces loyal to  Laurent Gbagbo  from the town of Doke, rebel spokesman Lass Com said by
phone today from the northwestern city of Man. Residents said
gunfire erupted in several neighborhoods of Abidjan, with
fighting reported in the densely populated neighborhood of
Yopougon.  “There was a lot of gunfire in Yopougon and the army has
blocked off the main highway toward the interior of the
country,” Aimee Aka, a resident of the neighborhood, said by
phone.    Ivory Coast , the world’s top cocoa producer, is on the
brink of civil war, with at least 365 people killed since a
disputed Nov. 28 election, according to the  United Nations .
Gbagbo retains the loyalty of the armed forces, while Ouattara
has set up his rival administration in the Golf hotel in the
commercial capital, Abidjan, protected by UN peacekeepers.  A State Department spokesman today said a group of U.S.
diplomats were turned back from Abidjan’s international airport
on March 10. They left on the next available flight, Harry
Edwards said in an e-mailed response to questions. He didn’t say
how many diplomats were stopped from entering the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
