Dowa Holdings Co.,  Japan ’s second-
largest zinc producer, said that it doesn’t know when it may be
able to resume operations at its smelter in Akita prefecture
after an earthquake cut the power supply on March 11.  The Tokyo-based company is checking its facilities,
spokesman Takahiro Yoshioka said by phone today. The Akita
smelter has an annual capacity of 200,000 metric tons, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
