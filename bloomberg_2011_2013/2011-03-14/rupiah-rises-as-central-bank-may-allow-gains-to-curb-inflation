Indonesia’s rupiah strengthened the
most in more than three months on speculation the central bank
will tolerate further appreciation to curb price pressures.
Bonds gained.  The currency snapped a two-day decline after Bank Indonesia
Governor Darmin Nasution said March 11 the central bank will
allow the rupiah to gain to help manage imported inflation.
Consumer prices in  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy rose 6.84
percent last month from a year earlier, near the 21-month high
of 7.02 percent in January.  Overseas funds  have boosted holdings
of the nation’s bonds by 2.6 percent so far this month to 205.6
trillion rupiah ($23.5 billion) as of March 11.  “The central bank has repeatedly said it will allow the
rupiah to strengthen,” said Lindawati Susanto, head of foreign-
exchange trading at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta.
“Investors still like Indonesian assets because the economic
environment is favorable.”  The rupiah advanced 0.5 percent to 8,763 per dollar as of
4:44 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the biggest gain since Nov. 18.    Indonesia ’s gross domestic product increased 6.9 percent in
the three months through December from a year earlier, the
fastest pace in six years.  The yield on the 8.25 percent bond due July 2021 fell five
basis points to 8.40 percent, according to closing prices from
the Inter-Dealer Market Association. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
