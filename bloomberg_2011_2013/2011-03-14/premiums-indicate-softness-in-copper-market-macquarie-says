Premiums added to metals prices
indicate “softness” in the copper market and are “fairly
firm” for aluminum, Macquarie Bank Ltd. said.  A drop in copper premiums was particularly “pronounced”
in  China , Macquarie analysts including Max Layton in London said
in a report dated March 11. Buyers in the country, the world’s
largest copper consumer, have been holding back as a result of
record-high prices and tighter credit conditions while
continuing to run down stockpiles, they said.  “This softness in physical copper premiums is clearly
inconsistent with recent record-high exchange prices and is one
of the key reasons that we expect to see continuing softness in
the copper market in the short term,” the analysts said.  Much stockpiled aluminum is “tightly held in storage-
financing deals,” making it less easily available to consumers,
Macquarie said. “Off-exchange” inventories are shrinking,
according to the bank.  “The tightness that end users experience in the market
currently is supporting aluminum premiums,” the analysts said.
The premiums are fees for delivery to a particular location

recent months, while premiums in  Asia  show signs of “some
softening,” with China in particular reported to be quiet,
according to Macquarie.  To contact the reporter on this story:
