  Mitsubishi Materials Corp. (5711) , Japan’s
third-largest copper producer, said it doesn’t know when it may
be able to resume operations at its Onahama smelter after an
earthquake halted the power supply on March 11.  “We’ve no idea when we can resume operations,” spokesman
Toshiaki Yamada said today. The smelter in Fukushima prefecture,
northern Japan, has an annual capacity of 258,000 metric tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
