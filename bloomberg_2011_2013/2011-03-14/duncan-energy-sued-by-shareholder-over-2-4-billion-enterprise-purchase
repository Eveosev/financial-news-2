Duncan Energy Partners LP was sued
by a shareholder over claims its $2.4 billion purchase by  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  undervalues the partnership.  Enterprise, the biggest U.S. pipeline partnership,
announced Feb. 23 plans to reacquire its former subsidiary in an
all-stock deal in which Duncan holders would get 0.9545 unit of
Enterprise for each unit they own. The exchange ratio fails to
compensate the partnership’s unit holders for their interest in
future performance, shareholder Sanjay Israni said in a
complaint.  “The proposed acquisition is expected to significantly
improve the growth and value of Enterprise,” lawyers for Israni
said in the complaint filed March 11 in Delaware Chancery Court.  Enterprise, which sold units of Duncan Energy in a 2007
initial public offering, is seeking to buy the 42 percent of the
company it doesn’t already own. The deal represents a 28 percent
premium over Houston-based Duncan Energy’s closing price on Feb.
22.  Israni is seeking to represent all Duncan Energy unit
holders.  Officials at both companies couldn’t immediately be reached
for comment.  The case is Israni v.  Duncan Energy Partners LP (DEP)  et al,
CA6270, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
