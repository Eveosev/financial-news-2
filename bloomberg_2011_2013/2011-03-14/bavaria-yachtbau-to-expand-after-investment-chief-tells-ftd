Bavaria Yachtbau is planning an
expansion after two U.S.  hedge funds  invested in the
manufacturer,  Financial Times Deutschland  cited Chief Executive
Officer Jens Ludmann as saying.  The yachtmaker, based in Giebelstadt, Germany, agreed three
months ago to buy a French-Italian boat builder, and it plans to
add sales in the U.S. after getting a new dealer there, with
annual deliveries of 100 to 150 sailboats possible in three to
five years, FT Deutschland cited Ludmann as saying in an
interview. The company is also looking at growth markets in  Asia , Russia and  Brazil , he said, according to the report.  Bavaria Yachtbau’s capital situation is “comfortable”
following investment by the hedge funds, Oaktree Capital
Management LLC and Anchorage Advisors LLC, Ludmann said,
according to FT Deutschland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
