Indicators of price momentum suggest
that the difference in yields between two- and 10-year Treasury
notes may narrow further, according to CRT Capital Group LLC.  Daily stochastics, used to predict a security’s movement
based on how close its price is to the highest or lowest levels,
are signaling that the yield curve has “room to extend
further,” as the level approaches the bottom of the 2011 range
and is below a 21-day moving average of 2.78 percentage points.  “There is a downward momentum on the yield curve that
continues to build,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government bond
strategist at CRT Capital in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “If we do
get a continuation of this rally we would expect the curve to
flatten further led by the long end.”  The difference is 2.77 percentage points, down from a high
this year of 2.92 percentage points on Feb. 7. It widened one
basis point today.  The curve faces initial resistance at 2.83 percentage
points, Lyngen said. Resistance is a level on a chart where sell
orders may be clustered. In  technical analysis , investors and
analysts study charts of trading patterns to forecast changes in
a security, commodity, currency or index.  Two-year note yields touched 0.56 percent today, the lowest
level since Feb. 1. The 10-year note yield slid four basis
points to 3.36 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
