The Ugandan government halted plans
for  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ’s local unit to block calls to the network
operated by Libyan-owned Uganda Telecom Ltd. over a disputed
unpaid bill, Information and Communication Minister Aggrey Awori
said in a statement published in the New Vision newspaper.  The government intervened to save the public from the
communication disruption which would result from the blockage,
the press release in the Kampala-based newspaper said.  “The government has reached an agreed position with both
parties to resolve the matter amicably as soon as possible,”
Awori said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
