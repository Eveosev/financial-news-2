  Ghana ’s central bank will reduce
the number of investors allowed to purchase government debt in
auctions to 15 “big banks” by April 1 to develop a more liquid
secondary market, said Stephen Tetteh, chief executive officer
of the bank’s central securities depository arm.  “Currently, the primary dealing system is very loosely
managed,” Tetteh said in an interview in  London  today. “Any
bank that obtains a banking license automatically has access to
the primary market. Even with as little as $2 you can buy at the
primary market.”  Under the new rules, primary dealers of the West African
country’s government bonds will need a minimum of 5 million
Ghanaian cedis ($3 million) of capital to participate, he said.

them to maturity, he said.  “Liquidity has been a problem,” according to Tetteh. “A
lot of investors have a tendency to buy and hold.  There are 27 banks operating in the country.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
