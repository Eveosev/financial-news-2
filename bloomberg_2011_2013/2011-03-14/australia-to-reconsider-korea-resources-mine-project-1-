  Australia ’s New South Wales state
government plans to reconsider a rejected coal mine proposal by
Korea Resources Corp., said the Korean state-owned explorer.  Korea Resources will re-submit a proposal to develop the
Wallarah 2 coal mine near Wyong “as soon as possible” after
doing some more work on issues raised by the state government,
the Seoul-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  The Korean company last week sent a delegation to the state
to urge the government to withdraw its decision to reject the
proposal. The government refused it because of unresolved
concerns regarding subsidence, water, ecological and heritage
impacts, state Planning Minister Tony Kelly said March 4.  A Korea Resources-led group, including SK Networks Co. and
a Japanese partner, has invested about 45 billion won ($40
million) on the project since 1995, according to Korea Resources
spokesman Kang Shin Young.  To contact the reporter on this story:
