White Tiger Gold Ltd. dropped 28
percent in Toronto trading after the mining company agreed to
buy  Century Mining Corp. (CMM)  in an all-stock deal to add gold output
from mines in  Canada  and Peru.  Each Century share will be exchanged for 0.4 of a White
Tiger share, giving investors in Toronto-based White Tiger 39
percent of the new company and Century shareholders 61 percent,
White Tiger and Century said today in a statement. The takeover
requires shareholder, regulatory and court approval, the
companies said.  White Tiger fell C$1.30 to C$3.25 as of the close of
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, its biggest decline since
the shares started trading Dec. 31. Blaine, Washington-based
Century rose 16 percent to 67 cents on the  TSX Venture Exchange .  Century Chief Executive Officer Daniel Major will be
president and CEO of the enlarged company. Maxim Finskiy, White
Tiger’s executive chairman, will continue in the role. White
Tiger CEO Geoffrey Cowley will be chief operating officer.  White Tiger’s Savkino mine in  Russia  near the Chinese
border, Century’s Lamaque gold project in Quebec and San Juan
mine in Peru will produce a combined 111,000 to 121,000 ounces
of gold this year, the companies said.  Moelis & Co. is advising White Tiger on the deal and Blair
Franklin Capital Partners Inc. is advising Century.  To contact the reporter on this story:
