Royal Dutch Shell Plc ,  Europe ’s
largest oil company, said its venture made a “significant”
deepwater crude discovery off Brunei.  Brunei Shell Petroleum Co , which is equally owned by Shell
and the government, made the Geronggong discovery in about 1,000
meter-deep water (3,300 feet), Shell said today in a  statement .
That’s the deepest water depth in which BSP has discovered
hydrocarbons in Bruneian acreage, it said.  Shell used the Noble Phoenix rig, owned by  Noble Corp. (NE) , the
world’s third-largest deep-water drilling contractor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
