  Bulgaria  will seek additional
safety guarantees on two Russian nuclear reactors planned for a
plant at Belene on the Danube after an earthquake off  Japan 
caused an explosion at the Fukushima plant and raised the
potential for a reactor meltdown.  Bulgaria’s Energy and Economy Minister Traicho Traikov will
“request additional information and guarantees from the
manufacturer and the Vienna-based  International Atomic Energy
Agency  on the safety of the new reactor, in light of events in
Japan,” the ministry said today in an e-mail.  Bulgaria contracted in 2005 Russia’s Atomstroyexport ZAO, a
unit of Rosatom Corp. to build two pressurised, light water
1,000-megawatt reactors of type B-466. The project has since
stalled because of lack of funding and disagreements over the
price increase caused by the delay.  Rosatom has increased the price to 6.4 billion euros ($8.9
billion) from 4 billion euros because of delayed construction.
Bulgaria estimates the cost at about 5 billion euros.  Kozloduy, Bulgaria’s only atomic power plant, has two
Russian-made 1,000-megawatt reactors, which supply 38 percent of
the nation’s needs. The government is also considering building
one or two reactors at Kozloduy, also on the Danube.  To contact the reporter on this story:
