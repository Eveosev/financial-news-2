Investors should buy the euro
against the yen on bets European Union leaders will come up with
a plan to solve the debt crisis while Japanese officials resist
yen gains after last week’s earthquake, BNP Paribas said.  “While we expect continued pressure on dollar-yen on
repatriation flows, it seems likely that the  Bank of Japan (8301)  will
be far more aggressive in its approach,” analysts led by Hans- Guenter Redeker, London-based global head of foreign-exchange
strategy, wrote in an investor note today. “We look for
opportunities to go long euro-yen over the medium term.”  The euro bought 114.29 yen as of 9:53 a.m. in  London ,
compared with 113.76 at the end of last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
