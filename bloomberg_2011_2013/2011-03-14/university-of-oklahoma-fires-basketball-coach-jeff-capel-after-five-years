Jeff Capel was fired as basketball
coach at the  University of Oklahoma  following the Sooners’
second straight losing season.  Capel, 36, led  Oklahoma  to the quarterfinals of college
basketball’s 2009 national tournament before going a combined
27-36 the past two seasons. He was released because the Big 12
Conference school “would be best served by a change of
direction,” Athletic Director Joe Castiglione said today in a
statement.  “As we look to the future, we do so with a great
university, a proud tradition in basketball, continued
commitment to excellence in all areas and some of the country’s
finest facilities,” Castiglione said on the school’s website.
“We expect that those qualities will play an important role in
our search for a new coach. We’re ready to embark on that
process.”  Capel, who played at  Duke University  from 1994 to 1997, had
a  96-69 record  and 37-43 mark in conference play over five
seasons with the Sooners, twice leading the Norman, Oklahoma,
school to the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
