Rick Martin, a Quebec native who
played left wing for the Buffalo Sabres’ French Connection line
in the 1970s, died yesterday after being involved in one-car
accident. He was 59.  The Sabres didn’t disclose a cause of death and said an
autopsy will be performed. The Buffalo News reported Martin had
a heart attack while driving, citing police in the Buffalo
suburb of Clarence,  New York .   Martin was selected by the Sabres with the fifth overall
pick in the 1971 draft and set a then-National Hockey League
rookie record with 44 goals in his first season. He played on a
line with center Gilbert Perreault and right wing Rene Robert
that became known as the French Connection.   Over 11 NHL seasons, including nine in Buffalo, Martin
scored 384 goals in 685 games.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
