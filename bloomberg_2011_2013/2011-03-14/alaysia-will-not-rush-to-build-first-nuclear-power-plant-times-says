Malaysia says it will not rush into
building its first nuclear power plant after an earthquake and
tsunami left  Japan  struggling to prevent a potential meltdown,
the New Straits Times reported, citing Energy, Green Technology
and Water Minister Peter Chin Fah Kui.  The country is planning to build two 1,000-megawatt nuclear
power plants, with the first unit expected to start operating in
2021, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
