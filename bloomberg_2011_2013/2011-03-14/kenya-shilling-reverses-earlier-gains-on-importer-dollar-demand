  Kenya ’s shilling reversed earlier
gains versus the dollar and headed for a 17-year low on demand
for the U.S. currency from importers.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened 0.2
percent to 85.55 per dollar by 2:11 p.m. in Nairobi after
earlier strengthening as much as 0.7 percent to 84.80 from a
close of 85.38 on March 11.  “The demand for the greenback is still high as importers
are engaged in forward coverage, hence seeking more dollars, a
situation likely to remain in the coming days,” Steve Lagat, a
trader at Nairobi-based CfC Stanbic Bank Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
