  Honeywell International Inc. (HON)  and
four other U.S. companies will invest in Slovakia, creating a
combined 2,500 jobs, Economy Minister Juraj Miskov said today.  Honeywell will spend 38 million euros ($53 million) to
build a turbocharger plant near Presov, eastern Slovakia, which
will employ 446 people, Miskov said at a press conference in the
capital Bratislava today. The ministry will recommend the
Cabinet to provide the company with state aid in the form of tax
breaks and cash subsidies, he said.    International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) ,  AT&T Inc. (T) ,  Johnson
Controls Inc. (JCI)  and Hewlett Packard Co. also plan to expand their
operations in Slovakia, aiming to hire about 2,000 people
between them, Miskov said.  The government is seeking to attract more foreign investors
after the global economic slowdown cut the inflow by half to 123
million euros in 2010. Sario, the state agency for promoting
foreign investment, is currently working on 20 possible
projects, Director Robert Simoncic said at todayâ€™s press
conference, without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
