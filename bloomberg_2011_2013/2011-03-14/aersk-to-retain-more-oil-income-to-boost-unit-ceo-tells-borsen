A.P.Moeller-Maersk A/S will retain
a larger portion of income from its oil business to invest in
new  oil fields , exploration and technological improvements after
completing a turnaroun of its container business, Chief
Executive Officer Nils Smedegaard Andersen said in an interview
with the Borsen newspaper.  “There is a need for an improvement of the way in which we
run our oil business,” Smedegaard Andersen said, according to
the Copenhagen-based newspaper.  The company has been selling oil faster than it’s been able
to find new reserves, Borsen said.  “We haven’t re-established enough reserves to secure the
long term in the company,” Smedegaard Andersen told the
newspaper. “We’re not about to run out of oil, but in the oil
business one needs finds that at least match one’s annual
production, and we haven’t invested enough here.”  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
