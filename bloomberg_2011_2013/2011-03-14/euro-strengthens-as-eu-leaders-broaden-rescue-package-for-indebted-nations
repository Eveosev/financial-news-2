The euro advanced versus a majority
of its 16 most-traded counterparts after European Union leaders
agreed on a retooled bailout plan for the region’s most indebted
nations.  The 17-nation currency rose for a second day against the
dollar after regional leaders agreed during the weekend to widen
the scope of a rescue fund aimed at resolving the debt crisis
and cut the cost of loans to Greece. The yen erased a gain
against the dollar as  Japan ’s central bank said it will add 15
trillion yen ($183 billion) to the financial system and increase
its asset-purchase program following last week’s earthquake.
South Africa’s rand posted the best performance against the
greenback among the major currencies on rising gold prices.  “People are buying euros on the fact that the euro-zone
leaders have reached a deal on key reforms,” said  Andrew Busch ,
a global currency strategist at Bank of Montreal in  Chicago .  The euro climbed 0.6 percent to $1.3992 at 5 p.m. in New
York, from $1.3903 March 11. The Japanese currency traded at
81.63 per dollar after weakening as much as 0.8 percent and
appreciating as much as 1.5 percent to 80.62, the strongest
since November.    Europe  Accord  Europe’s shared currency advanced after euro-area leaders
negotiated an accord to allow primary-market bond purchases that
will offer a lifeline to aid recipients in return for austerity
commitments. Leaders will allow the facility to spend its full
440 billion-euro capacity, removing restrictions that would have
capped outlays at about 250 billion euros ($350 billion), though
it won’t be used to finance bond buybacks for debt-strapped
states.  A final agreement is slated for a summit on March 24-25.  The yen erased its earlier advance to a four-month high
against the dollar after the Bank of Japan pumped record funds
into an economy reeling from last week’s earthquake.  The emergency measure represents the Japanese central
bank’s first same-day repurchase operations since May when it
added funds to help stabilize markets amid  Greece ’s debt crisis.  BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his board also doubled
the facility that buys assets from  government bonds  to exchange-
traded funds to 10 trillion yen. Besides the 15 trillion yen of
emergency funds deployed, the central bank offered to buy 3
trillion yen of government bonds from lenders in  repurchase
agreements  starting March 16.  Japan Borrowing  Japanese borrowing costs were cut near zero in 2008 as
officials sought to revive growth and end deflation. Finance
Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said earlier today that he’s closely
watching the foreign exchange, stock and Japanese bond markets.  Investors should buy the euro against the yen on bets
European Union leaders will come up with a plan to solve the
debt crisis while Japanese officials resist yen gains after last
week’s earthquake, BNP Paribas said.  “While we expect continued pressure on dollar-yen on
repatriation flows, it seems likely that the  Bank of Japan  will
be far more aggressive in its approach,” analysts led by Hans-
Guenter Redeker, London-based global head of foreign-exchange
strategy at BNP Paribas, wrote in an investor note today.  Japan’s currency advanced earlier as stocks slid and on
prospects domestic investors will buy back yen to pay for damage
caused by the disaster. The 8.9-magnitude temblor on March 11
and subsequent tsunami may have killed 10,000 in Miyagi
prefecture north of  Tokyo , according to local police.  Yen Level  The yen may approach its weakest level since May against
the euro should it breach key levels, according to analysts at
UBS AG, the world’s second-largest foreign-exchange trader.  “Resistance levels to watch are at 115 yen and 115.25
yen,” strategists including London-based  Richard Adcock  wrote
in a client note today. “Clearing this zone would again open
the way to the recent high of 115.93 yen, which remains the key
medium-term reversal trigger when combined with a daily close
above 115.65 yen. Support today lies at 113.70.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.6 percent and the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average slumped 6.2 percent.  The Swiss franc rallied 0.6 percent to 92.44 centimes per
dollar, trading within less than 30 centimes of a record high of
92.02 reached March 2. The pound strengthened 0.6 percent to
$1.6172.    South Africa ’s rand rose 0.9 percent to 6.8181 per dollar.
Gold, one of the nation’s exports, increased 0.3 percent to
$1,426.50 an ounce.  Aussie, Kiwi  The currencies of countries that trade with Japan, such as  Australia  and  New Zealand , lost the most against the yen.  Australia’s dollar slid 0.4 percent to 1.0097 per  U.S.
dollar  and dropped 0.7 percent to 82.43 yen after earlier
declining to 81.47, the lowest since Jan. 31. New Zealand’s
currency fell 0.5 percent to 73.93 cents per U.S. dollar and
eased 0.7 percent to 60.35 per yen.  Oil-exporting countries are cutting holdings of  U.S.
government debt  as energy prices rise, helping depress the
dollar, the worst-performing major currency of the past six
months.  Treasuries owned by oil producers and institutions such as
U.K. banks that are proxies for Middle East nations fell 9
percent in the second half of 2010 to $654.6 billion, the first
decline in the final six months of a year since the Treasury
Department began compiling the data in 2006. The sales may
continue, if history is any guide, because Barclays Plc said
Middle East petroleum exporting nations have traditionally
placed only 25 percent of their savings in dollar-based assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
