Raw sugar fell to a two-week low,
leading commodities lower, as conditions in  Japan  worsened
following last week’s earthquake and tsunami, threatening to
hurt economic growth and demand for raw materials.  Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said Japan faces its worst crisis
since the end of World War II, and local media estimated the
death toll from the March 11 temblor may top 10,000. The  Bank of
Japan  today injected 15 trillion yen ($183 billion) into the
financial system. The UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity
Index fell, extending the longest slump since August.  Most prices “are down because people are still assessing
the impact of the quake,” said Jeff Bauml, a senior vice
president at R.J. O’Brien & Associates, a broker in New York.  In other markets,  crude oil  rebounded on speculation that
unrest in the Middle East may escalate after Saudi Arabia sent
its troops into Bahrain. Cotton tumbled. The UBS Bloomberg index
declined 0.3 percent to 1,717.89, the sixth straight decline.  Raw sugar for May dropped 1.07 cents, or 3.7 percent, to
27.79 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The
sweetener posted the biggest drop among 26 commodities in the
UBS Bloomberg index. Earlier, the price touched 27.41 cents, the
lowest since Feb. 25.  Crude Oil  Oil futures for April delivery rose 3 cents to $101.19 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , ending a four-
session slump. Earlier, the price touched $98.47, the lowest
since March 1.    Saudi Arabia ’s cabinet said the kingdom has responded to a
Bahraini request for “support.” Prices were lower most of the
day on speculation that energy demand in Japan, the third-
largest economy, may decline after an 8.9-magnitude earthquake
devastated parts of the northeast.  “The situation in Bahrain appears to be escalating and
people start to wonder that it could become a bigger issue,”
said Carl Larry, the president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in
Houston.  Saudi troops entered the neighboring country as part of a
regional force from the Gulf Cooperation Council, the first
outside intervention since a wave of popular uprisings swept
through parts of the region.  Cotton  Cotton tumbled the most allowed by the ICE exchange on
signs that demand may ease in  China , the world’s biggest buyer,
after prices approached a record high.  The China National Cotton Information Center said  imports 
dropped 53 percent in February to 184,200 metric tons from
January, down 17 percent from a year earlier. On March 11, the
price jumped as much as 3.5 percent to $2.0798 a pound. The
fiber climbed to an all-time high of $2.197 on March 7.  “This sell-off is largely on a reduction to demand
expectations at these high prices,” said Erica Rannestad, a
commodity analyst at CPM Group in New York. “A lot of
manufacturers are expected to purchase less cotton and use less
in end-products.”  Cotton for May delivery fell by the exchange limit of 7
cents, or 3.4 percent, to $1.9794 on ICE. The price dropped 3.6
percent last week. The fiber has more than doubled in the past
year as demand outstripped global supplies.  Commodities settled as follows:  Precious metals:
