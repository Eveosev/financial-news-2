  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest
U.S. energy company, plans to boost oil and natural-gas output
20 percent by 2017, more than double the rate of growth from
2003 to 2010.  The production forecast is based on $79-a-barrel oil, the  San Ramon , California-based company said in a slide presentation
to be delivered to analysts today in  New York . Chevron expects
to pump the equivalent of 3.3 million barrels of crude daily in
2017, up from 2.76 million last year.  The company’s production growth will be driven by projects
such as the $37 billion Gorgon development in Australia, which
is scheduled to begin liquefying gas for export in 2014, Chevron
said in the slide presentation.  Chevron expects to surpass  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  in liquefied
natural gas production by 2020 to become the world’s fourth-
largest supplier of the fuel, according to the slides. Only
Qatar, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Algeria’s Sonatrach Group will
have greater LNG output by then, Chevron said.  Chevron rose 87 cents to $100.80 in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange at 4:00 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
