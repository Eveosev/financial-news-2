Riksbank Deputy Governor Karolina
Ekholm said the difference between Swedish and international
rates mustn’t become so big that the krona strengthens too fast
in relation to the Riksbank’s inflation target, Dagens Nyheter
reported citing an interview with Ekholm.  This is what could happen if the Riksbank raises the repo
rate too fast while other important central banks let their
rates remain unchanged, the newspaper quoted her as saying. The
combination of higher rates and a stronger krona will have
repercussions because it will take longer to get back to a
normal employment rate level, she said in the interview with
Dagens Nyheter.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
