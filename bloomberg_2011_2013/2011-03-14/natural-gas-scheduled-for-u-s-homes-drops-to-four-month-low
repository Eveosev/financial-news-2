Natural gas shipments scheduled for
delivery to U.S. households dropped to the lowest level in
almost four months as warmer weather reduced heating demand.
Deliveries for  Ohio  fell 8.6 percent.  Scheduled shipments for residential use declined for a
fourth day, dropping 1.7 percent to 32.8 million dekatherms
(31.9 billion cubic feet), the lowest level since Nov. 22,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of 3:24 p.m. in  New
York .  About 2.17 million dekatherms were to be delivered to Ohio
homes, down from yesterday’s 2.38 million, Bloomberg data show.  Wholesale gas delivered into Columbia Gas Transmission in
Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia and New
York gained 12.68 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $3.9971 per million
British thermal units on the  Intercontinental Exchange .  Temperatures will be as much as 14 degrees Fahrenheit above
normal across the country through March 18, according to
Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  The low temperature in Cincinnati may be 39 degrees
Fahrenheit (4 Celsius) tomorrow, 5 degrees above normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  About 69 percent of Ohio’s heating demand is powered by
natural gas, according to  the Energy Department .  To contact the reporter on this story:
