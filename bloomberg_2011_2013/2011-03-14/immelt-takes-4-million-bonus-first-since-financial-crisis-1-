  General Electric Co. (GE)  awarded Chief
Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt a $4 million bonus, the first
he has accepted since the financial crisis, after consistent
quarterly profit growth and two dividend increases in 2010.  Immelt, who received a bonus of $5.8 million in 2007,
declined the payment for the next two years as GE grappled with
the crisis and a worldwide recession and its shares trailed the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Last year, GE profit climbed and the shares topped the  S&P
500  for the first time since 2004. The company unlocked a war
chest of cash to restart share buybacks, boost its dividend a
total 40 percent and make more than $8 billion in acquisitions.  “This performance is a direct result of actions taken by
Mr. Immelt and the GE leadership team over the last few years,”
the management and compensation committee of the board wrote in
a  proxy statement  filed today with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.  Immelt, who works without a contract, received a 2010
salary of $3.3 million, unchanged since 2005, the Fairfield,
Connecticut-based company said in the proxy statement. Total
compensation under SEC rules, including a grant of 2 million
options and a $6.2 million increase in pension value, was $21.4
million.  ‘Pretty Humbling’  “Being a CEO can be pretty humbling,” Immelt, 55, wrote
in the company’s annual  letter to shareholders , released
yesterday. “The toughest years of my life were 2008 and 2009.
They were difficult for the company, investors and the economy
as well. But our team worked hard for investors and the company.
We promised you we would come out of the crisis a stronger
company and we have.”  GE ended the year with a record $175 billion order backlog
and surpassed the board’s financial objectives for Immelt on
margins, profit, cash from operations and return on total
capital. Earnings gained 15 percent, while  GE Capital ’s  ending
net investment , a measure of a financial company’s size, was
trimmed 9 percent as Immelt worked to shrink the unit.  The company’s board created a three-member risk committee,
chaired by board member W. Geoffrey Beattie, the deputy chairman
of Thomson Reuters Corp., to oversee GE and GE Capital’s risk
assessment structure after the annual corporate governance
assessment, said Anne Eisele, a spokeswoman.  The new panel reduces the audit committee’s workload and
streamlines “the oversight of GE Capital’s enterprise risk
management,” Eisele said.  Outpacing S&P 500  GE shares climbed 21 percent last year, compared with 13
percent for the S&P 500. GE fell 44 cents, or 2.2 percent, to
$19.92 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.  Immelt, 55, has run the world’s biggest maker of  jet
engines , locomotives, medical-imaging systems and power-
generation equipment since Sept. 7, 2001.  His total realized compensation last year was $5.85
million, up from $5.75 million the year before, according to the
proxy filing. The measure essentially reflects what would be on
his personal W-2 tax form, Eisele said.  The CEO was granted 2 million  stock options  with a value of
$7.4 million, half vesting in three years and half in five
years, “to increase the equity-based portion of his bonus and
to underscore the board’s confidence in his leadership,” GE’s
compensation committee, chaired by retired Johnson & Johnson CEO
Ralph Larsen, wrote.  The options have a strike price of $16.11, the closing
share price on March 4, 2010.  ‘American Competitiveness’  Immelt hasn’t sold stock during his tenure and has
purchased a total of 870,000 shares on the open market. That
includes 40,000 more shares he purchased earlier this month,
also on the open market, Eisele said.  In January, U.S. President  Barack Obama  named Immelt to
lead his council on job creation and competitiveness, an
advisory position.  “Rest assured, I will continue to work as hard as I ever
have for success at GE,” Immelt wrote to investors. “At the
same time, I will work with other CEOs and public leaders to
improve American competitiveness and innovation.”  Immelt has added about 6,300 manufacturing jobs in the U.S.
as he pushes to bolster exports. GE’s total workforce still
declined 5.6 percent to 287,000 employees last year while the
number of employees in the U.S. shrank 1 percent to 133,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Rachel Layne  in  Boston  at
