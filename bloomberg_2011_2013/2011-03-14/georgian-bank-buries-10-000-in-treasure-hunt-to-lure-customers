TBC Bank,  Georgia â€™s second-largest
lender, said it will bury $10,000 in the capital Tbilisi as the
prize in a treasure hunt as part of a promotional campaign to
attract new customers.  The game will begin on March 18 at 10:00 a.m., and players
will be given a map and list of clues, TBC said today in an e-
mailed statement. The winner gets to keep the cash, the bank
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
