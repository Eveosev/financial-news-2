European Union regulators started
legal action against the governments of France and  Spain  over
charges levied on phone operators, and threatened similar
measures against a proposed telecommunications tax in Hungary.  European Commission  regulators will sue France and Spain in
the EU’s Court of Justice to end charges both countries levy on
telecom operators to support public television, the bloc’s
executive arm said in a statement. Separately, the Commission
said it will ask Hungary to formally defend a similar tax
introduced last year, which may be “incompatible with EU
rules.”  French phone companies have been paying some 400 million
euros ($560 million) a year since the country’s charge was
introduced in March 2009, to offset the end of paid advertising
on public television, the EU said. Meanwhile, Spanish operators
must pay 0.9 percent of their gross revenue to help support the
country’s public broadcaster under a similar levy introduced in
October 2010, according to the regulators.    Hungary  in October introduced a “special tax” on phone
operators that also applied to retail and energy as part of a
deficit-fighting plan. Together with a separate bank levy, the
taxes were intended to raise 343 billion forint ($1.76 billion)
annually over a three year period.  EU rules specify that charges levied on operators may only
be used to cover administrative and regulatory costs, the
Commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
