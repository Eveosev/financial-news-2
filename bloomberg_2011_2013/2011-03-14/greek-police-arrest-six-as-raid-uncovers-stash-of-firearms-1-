Greek police arrested six people
today after anti-terrorism raids uncovered a stash of firearms,
police uniforms and other equipment.  The five men and one woman were arrested in raids on two
houses, in  Athens  and Nea Ionia, Volos, in the early hours of
the morning, police said in an e-mailed statement. Police found
three assault rifles, seven pistols, one revolver, ammunition,
police uniforms, wigs and wireless communication devices. They
also found notes relating to a planned bank robbery in the Volos
area, the statement said.  Three of those arrested are wanted for participation in the
Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire urban guerrilla group, the
statement said. The group has claimed responsibility for a
series of letter bombs sent to foreign dignitaries and embassies
in November, and also took credit for a Dec. 30 bomb that
damaged a courthouse in the Panormou district of Athens.  The three have been charged with being part of a terrorist
organization; procurement and possession of explosives; and
setting off explosions with the possibility of causing injury,
the statement said.  A second woman was also detained after the raid on the
house in Athens, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
