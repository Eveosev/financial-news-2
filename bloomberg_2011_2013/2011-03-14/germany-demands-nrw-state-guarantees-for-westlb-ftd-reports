  Germany  is pushing the state of
North Rhine-Westphalia to provide guarantees for WestLB AG to
make sure the lender doesn’t have liquidity problems during its
restructuring or sale, the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Apollo Global Management LLC and  Lone Star Funds , which
last week presented their bids for Dusseldorf-based WestLB in
Brussels, are now talking to the lender’s management and non-
binding offers are expected by April 7, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
