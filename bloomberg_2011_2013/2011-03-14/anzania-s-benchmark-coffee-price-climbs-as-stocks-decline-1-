Tanzania’s benchmark coffee price
advanced 11 percent at an auction on March 10 amid lower
supplies, the  Tanzania Coffee Board  said.  The average price of the top arabica AA grade rose to
$327.93 per 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, from $294.14 two weeks
earlier, the board said in an e-mailed statement today. Supplies
of the grade fell 51 percent to 1,218 bags, it said. Prices of
other grades rose as stocks declined and global prices improved,
the board said.  “We’re very close to the end of the season and there’s
been mixed quality,” said William Harris, managing director of
coffee trader Taylor Winch (Tanzania) Ltd., by phone from the
northern city of Moshi. “The rise in prices was both because of
higher prices in  New York , and some good quality beans here.”  Tanzania reaps its crop from April through August. Arabica
accounts for 75 percent of the country’s output, with robusta
making up for the rest. Output in the 12 months through June may
rise 54 percent to 55,000 tons because of improved weather,
Adolph Kumburu, the board’s director general, said on Aug. 3.  Total supplies at the 28th auction of the 2010-11 season
fell 12 percent, while sales dropped 18 percent to 10,038 bags,
according to the board’s statement.  The following are details of the March 10 auction in U.S.
