The Bovespa stock index gained for
a second day as steelmakers rallied, offsetting concerns that  Brazil  will face higher inflation and lower growth than
previously expected.  Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA, Brazil’s third-biggest
steelmaker, gained on bets that prices for the metal will climb.
Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA rose on speculation a
rival plans to buy a stake. Homebuilder Cyrela Brazil Realty SA
Empreendimentos e Participacoes fell the most since October 2009
after reducing its sales estimates for 2011 and 2012, adding to
concerns that rising borrowing costs will hurt demand.  The Bovespa stock index advanced 0.7 percent to 67,169.25
at the close of Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time. It
fell as much as 0.9 percent earlier. Forty-four stocks rose on
the index, while 21 fell. The real strengthened 0.3 percent to
1.66 per  U.S. dollar .  “Steelmakers are gaining on bets they’ll be able to
fulfill the demand that will not be met by Japanese producers,”
said  Felipe Casotti , who helps manage 1.2 billion reais ($722.8
million) at Maxima Asset Management in Rio de Janeiro.  At least five “big” Japanese  steel mills  could be shut
for the next six months following last week’s earthquake and
tsunami, said Raphael Biderman, a Sao Paulo-based analyst at
Bradesco BBI, citing a report from the Steel Index in a note to
clients.  Cia. Siderurgica, known as CSN, gained 2.3 percent to 26.40
reais, the most since Feb. 16.  Usiminas  Voting shares of Usinas Siderurgicas, known as Usiminas,
jumped 9.6 percent to 31.55 reais, the most since December 2008,
and preferred shares rose 2.1 percent to 21.52 reais. Investors
are wagering Gerdau SA, Latin America’s largest steelmaker, will
acquire part of the company, according to e-mails to clients
today from Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Press officials at Gerdau and an outside agency
representing Usiminas, who asked not to be identified because of
internal policies, didn’t immediately comment.  Gerdau gained 3.7 percent to 21.82 reais.  Economists covering the Brazilian economy cut their growth
forecast for next year for the first time in 12 months on bets
that policy makers will need to slow the economy to cool
inflation running at a 26-month high.  GDP  Brazil’s gross domestic product will expand 4.45 percent
next year, down from a week-earlier forecast of 4.5 percent,
according to the median forecast in a March 11 central bank
survey of about 100 economists published today. The economists
also cut their 2011 GDP growth forecast for a third straight
week, to 4.1 percent from 4.29 percent the previous week, the
survey found.  “With weak momentum coming from last year, and preliminary
first-quarter data on the weak side, we decided to revise down
our full-2011 growth forecast,” said Joyce Chang, an analyst at
JPMorgan Chase & Co., in a note to clients. A “tight labor
market and strong wage growth, combined with higher commodity
prices” are likely to keep inflation running at higher rates
this year, said Chang.  Consumer prices will rise 5.82 percent this year, compared
with a week-earlier forecast of 5.78 percent, according to the
central bank survey. The central bank targets inflation of 4.5
percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  Policy makers will increase the benchmark interest rate 50
basis points to 12.25 percent at the April 19-20 policy meeting,
according to the survey.  Cyrela tumbled 6.5 percent to 15.15 reais. Gafisa SA,
Brazil’s third-biggest homebuilder by revenue, declined 1.2
percent to 10.15 reais.  Tim, Hypermarcas  Hypermarcas SA, Brazil’s fourth-largest consumer-goods
company by market value, gained 2.2 percent to 18.40 reais. The
company posted fourth-quarter profit of 87.9 million reais ($53
million), a 5.8 percent increase from a year earlier.  Voting shares of Tim Participacoes SA, the Brazilian unit
of  Italy ’s largest phone company, fell 2.2 percent to 7.70 reais
after tumbling as much as 5.3 percent earlier. Milan prosecutors
are targeting Chief Executive Officer Luca Luciani in a probe of
inflated client numbers, two people familiar with the
investigation said.  Prosecutors are investigating whether Telecom Italia’s
wireless phone unit issued more than 1.5 million false phone
cards to inflate its client numbers, the people said.  A press official at an outside agency representing Tim, who
can’t be identified because of internal policy, declined to
comment.  Power Distributors  CPFL Energia SA gained 1.5 percent to 44.05 reais. Brazil’s
largest private-sector power distributor is in talks with
Neoenergia SA to evaluate “alternatives that could generate
synergies,” according to a regulatory filing. The companies
haven’t reached any agreement so far, CPFL said.  The Bovespa is down 3.1 percent this year after
homebuilders and banks retreated on concern rising inflation
will spur additional measures to restrict credit growth,
outweighing gains in oil and raw-material producers.  The index trades for 10.5 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares to a ratio of 13.8 for the Shanghai Composite Index,
7.3 for  Russia ’s Micex, and 17.3 for  India ’s Sensex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
