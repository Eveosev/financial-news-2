  NBNK Investments Plc (NBNK) , a U.K.
company listed in August that plans to build a bank by buying
lenders such as Northern Rock Plc, reported a full-year loss of
1.81 million pounds ($2.9 million).  NBNK had administrative expenses of 1.51 million pounds in
2010 and a loss of 424,000 pounds on the value of its derivative
financial liabilities, the company, chaired by Peter Levene,
said in a statement today. Interest income was 125,000 pounds
for the period.  The lender said last year it plans to offer customers
traditional branch-based banking, a personalized, locally
focused service and Internet and telephone banking. Its rivals
include Britain’s major banks,  Richard Branson ’s Virgin Money
Holdings U.K. Ltd. and Metro Bank.  NBNK agreed not to bid for Northern Rock for 12 months
starting from Nov. 1, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
