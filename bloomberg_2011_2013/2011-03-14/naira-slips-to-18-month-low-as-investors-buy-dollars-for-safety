  Nigeria ’s naira fell to the weakest
versus the dollar in 18 months after investors bought the U.S.
currency for safety and companies acquired dollars to pay
dividends.  The currency of sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy
depreciated as much as 0.5 percent to 155.59 and traded down 0.2
percent at 155.15 to the dollar by 5:20 p.m. in Lagos. That’s
the lowest level since August 2009.  Nigeria’s naira is overvalued and more exchange-rate
flexibility is needed to prevent the central bank from running
down foreign currency reserves to fix the rate, the  International Monetary Fund  said in February. Policy makers want
to keep the naira at about 150, and have depleted reserves to
defend the currency, which hasn’t traded at stronger than 151
per dollar November.  “Whether insinuations that the IMF wants the naira
devalued are true or not, this is enough to make many feel safer
to keep their money in dollar,” said Babatunde Obaniyi, an
analyst at Lagos-based Afrinvest West  Africa  Ltd. The naira has
always been weakened by multinational companies wanting to make
quarterly payouts abroad, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
