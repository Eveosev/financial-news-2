Toys “R” Us Inc., the world’s
biggest toy retailer, canceled a $1.1 billion loan transaction
to refinance debt and reduce borrowing costs, according to five
people briefed on the matter.  The company, bought by KKR & Co., Bain Capital LLC and  Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)  in 2005, had initiated lender negotiations
March 7 to re-price a $700 million  term loan  due September 2016
and raise a new, $400 million term loan due in 7.5 years.  Toys “R” Us follows Swift Transportation Co., the biggest
truckload carrier in  North America , and Apax Partners LLP-owned
Advantage Sales & Marketing LLC in pulling $3.34 billion of
loans that would cut borrowing costs. Investors are resisting
deals that would reduce their returns as the S&P/LSTA U.S.
Leveraged Loan 100 Index declined to 95.36 cents on the dollar
as of today from its Feb. 14 peak of 96.48 cents, the highest
since Nov. 7, 2007.  Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.,  Wells Fargo & Co ., Credit Suisse Group AG, Citigroup
Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG were leading the Toys “R” Us
transaction, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Wayne, New Jersey-based company proposed to pay an
interest rate 3 percentage points to 3.25 percentage points more
than the London interbank offered rate, Bloomberg data show.
Libor, the rate banks charge to lend to each other, would have
had a 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent floor.  Toys “R” Us planned to issue the loans at par, according
to Bloomberg data.  Kathleen Waugh, a spokeswoman for Toys “R” US, didn’t
immediately return a telephone message left at her office after
regular business hours in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
