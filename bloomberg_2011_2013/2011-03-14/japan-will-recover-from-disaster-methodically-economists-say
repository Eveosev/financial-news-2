  Japan  will recover from the
earthquake, tsunami and nuclear plant accident in a “calm and
methodical manner,” said Howard Davidowitz, chairman of
Davidowitz and Associates Inc. in  New York .  “They are good on sacrifice,” Davidowitz, a retail
industry analyst who splits his time between the U.S. and Japan,
said today in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Surveillance Midday” with Pimm Fox. “They deal with pain
very well. If any country can overcome this, it’s Japan.”  Economist Gary Shilling, who appeared with Davidowitz,
called Japan “unbelievably organized” and “sell sufficient.”
Shilling is president of A. Gary Shilling & Co. Inc. in
Springfield, New Jersey. “It’s not the end of Japan but it’s
going to be a tough time,” Shilling said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
