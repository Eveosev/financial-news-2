CSR Corp.,  China ’s biggest train
maker, is exploring options to build trains in Bulgaria,
Transport Minister Alexander Tsvetkov said.  Company representatives visited an engine plant in Sofia
and will see carriage production and maintenance plants before
discussing cooperation and investment, Tsvetkov told reporters
in Sofia today.  Bulgaria can offer CSR the lowest taxes in the European
Union and access to the EU’s 27-nation market, Tsvetkov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
