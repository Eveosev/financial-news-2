  Nelson Peltz ’s Trian Fund
Management LP urged  Family Dollar Stores Inc. (FDO)  to reconsider its
rejection of the hedge-fund firm’s takeover offer, saying it’s
confident of raising the capital necessary.  The firm also asked Family Dollar for a confidentiality
agreement so it can perform due diligence, according to a
regulatory filing today. Trian, based in New York, plans to fund
the offer with a combination of debt and equity.  Family Dollar rejected Trian’s offer, worth as much as $7.7
billion, earlier this month, saying the bid didn’t reflect the
value of its business. A successful purchase of the dollar chain
would be the largest of a U.S. retailer in six years.  Trian made its initial overtures public Feb. 15, proposing
an offer of $55 to $60 a share. Family Dollar declined to
comment today, spokesman Josh Braverman said by telephone.
Carrie Bloom, a Trian spokeswoman, didn’t immediately return a
phone call seeking comment.  The shares rose $1.05, or 2.1 percent, to $52.32 at 12:17
p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. They had
gained 3.1 percent this year before today.  Profit in the quarter ended Feb. 26 exceeded Family
Dollar’s projections, according to a separate statement from the
Matthews, North Carolina-based company today. Earnings were as
much as 98 cents a share, compared with a previous projection of
92 cents to 97 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
