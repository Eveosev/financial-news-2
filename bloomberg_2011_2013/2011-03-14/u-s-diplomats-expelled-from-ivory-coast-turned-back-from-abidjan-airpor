U.S. diplomats were expelled from
the  Ivory Coast  where President  Laurent Gbagbo  has refused to
relinquish power to  Alassane Ouattara  following a disputed Nov.
28 election, U.S. State Department spokesman Harry Edwards said.  A group of diplomats was “turned back” from Abidjan’s
airport on March 10, Edwards said in an e-mailed statement
today, without saying how many diplomats were expelled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
