  Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd. (127) , the  Hong Kong  developer controlled by billionaire Joseph Lau, said
it will post a loss for 2010 on decreases in the fair value of
its investment properties.  The shortfall, attributed to “unrealized valuation loss on
certain investment properties” in Hong Kong and mainland China,
“will not have any material adverse impact on the business
operation of the group,” Chinese Estates said in a statement to
the Hong Kong’s stock exchange today after the market closed.  Chinese Estates last year reported net income of HK$8.65
billion ($1.11 billion) for 2009.  The shares fell 1.1 percent to HK$12.84 at the 4 p.m. local
time close. They are unchanged this year, while the benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  is up 1.4 percent.  Lau is sixth on Forbes Magazine’s list of Hong Kong’s
richest people with an estimated wealth of $6.3 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
