The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4:15 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index plunged 1.7 percent to 14,289.95, while the
Colcap Index dropped 0.8 percent to 1,685.54.    Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC)   slid 7.8 percent to
53,020 pesos, its lowest level on a closing basis since Nov. 16.
The shares are reacting to the company’s earnings release on
March 11 and a report that showed “disappointing” reserve
levels, Paola Andrea Hernandez, an analyst at Valores
Bancolombia SA brokerage, wrote in a note today. The Toronto-
based  oil company  reported income of $217.6 million in 2010,
missing the average estimate of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg for a $259 million profit.    Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  ,  Colombia ’s largest oil company,
fell 0.1 percent to 3,890 pesos. The state-controlled oil
producer  said  in a March 11 statement published after markets
closed that its board of directors approved a share issuance
which will be carried out once financial regulators approve.    Inversiones Argos SA (INVARGOS)  , the owner of Colombia’s
biggest cement company, erased an earlier decline, rising 1.2
percent to 17,480 pesos. The company said in a late March 11
statement it took a $16 million loan from Banco de Bogota SA,
which raises the company’s total debt by about 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
