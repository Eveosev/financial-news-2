The  Carlyle Group , the world’s
second-biggest private equity fund, said it’s forming a
venture to buy more than $5 billion in container, dry bulk,
and tanker vessels as well as other shipping assets.  The venture, led by investors Gerry Wang and Graham Porter,
will deploy $900 million in equity capital over the next five
years, the Carlyle Group said today in a statement. It will
focus on Chinese state-backed shipbuilders, lenders and shipping
companies, it said.  “There is increasing desire among Chinese state-owned
entities to control the ships that transport their goods around
the world,” Wang said in the statement.  The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of commodity shipping
costs, has advanced 50 percent to 1,562 points since reaching
its 2011-low on Feb. 4. Container shipping costs as measured by
the Hamburg Shipbrokers’ Association have gained 23 percent to
685 points so far this year.  The venture has been formed by Carlyle, Tiger Group
Investments,  Seaspan Corp. (SSW) , the Washington Family, Gerry Wang
and Graham Porter, Carlyle said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
