  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) ’s application to
delist its Zambian unit from the country’s bourse has been
delayed by court action taken by minority shareholders, said
Beatrice Nkanza, chief executive officer of the exchange.  “They attempted last Friday to take over the remaining
shares in the company but failed because of a court action that
has been filed by the minority shareholders who refused to sell
their shares,” Nkanza said yesterday by phone from Lusaka, the
capital.  New Delhi-based Bharti last month applied for a second time
to delist from the exchange after the Securities and Exchange
Commission gave it permission to buy out the remaining 3 percent
of shareholders who last year refused to accept an offer of 710
kwacha ($0.15) a share.  The company has to wait for the court to give its final
decision on an application by the shareholders to stop the sale,
Nkanza said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
