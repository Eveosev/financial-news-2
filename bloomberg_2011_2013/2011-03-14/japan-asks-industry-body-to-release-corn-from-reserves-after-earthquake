  Japan , the world’s biggest corn
buyer, has asked an industry group to release feed grains
including corn from stockpiles to ensure supply after the March
11 earthquake, the agriculture ministry said in a statement.  The ministry has asked the Tokyo-based Feed Supply
Stabilization Organization to release the reserves.  Corn, wheat, soybean and rice futures tumbled on Friday
after Japan was struck by an 8.9-magnitude temblor and a tsunami
engulfed towns on the northern coast. The government was
checking ports and grain depots for damage, the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said on March 11. Farmland
was flooded with burning debris in some areas as the tidal surge
swept inland, images from state broadcaster NHK showed.  Japan imported 11 million metric tons of feed corn in the
year ended March 31, 2010, with 96 percent of it from the U.S.  The country has corn and sorghum inventories of 600,000
tons for the year ending March 31, the agriculture ministry said
on Sept. 30. Corn represents about 90 percent of Japan’s feed
grains stored for this year, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
