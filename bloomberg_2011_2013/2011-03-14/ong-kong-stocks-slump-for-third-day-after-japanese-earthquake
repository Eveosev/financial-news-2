Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose,
led by steel and coal producers, on speculation Japan’s
strongest earthquake on record will boost demand for raw
materials needed to rebuild from the devastation.  Citic Pacific Ltd., a steel producer and arm of  China ’s
biggest state-owned investment company, rose 4.8 percent for the
biggest advance in the  Hang Seng  Index. Coal producers China
Shenhua Energy Co. and China Coal Energy Co. advanced at least
1.6 percent.  Belle International Holdings Ltd. (1880) , China’s No. 1
retailer of women’s shoes, tumbled 2.4 percent amid concern
consumer spending will decline.  The Hang Seng Index rose 0.4 percent to 23,345.88 as of
4:01 p.m. in Hong Kong, erasing a loss of as much as 0.7 percent
earlier.  Japan ’s Topix index closed 7.5 percent lower, the most
since October 2008, after police said the 8.9-magnitude temblor
may have killed 10,000 people.  “Producers of conventional energy have very good support
right now,” said Banny Lam, Hong Kong-based associate director
of research at CCB International Securities. “While the
earthquake has stopped production in Japan, the orders will be
picked up by other countries nearby.”  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of H shares of
Chinese companies gained 1 percent to 12,882.75. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index tumbled 2.7 percent to 131.36 for the largest
decline since June 7.  The Hang Seng trades at 12.6 times estimated profit, near
the lowest level since April 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Among companies in the index, 25 rose and 18 declined.  Volatility Jumps  The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for  Hong Kong 
stock options, rose 1.5 percent to 20.73, indicating the Hang
Seng may swing 6 percent in the next 30 days.  The Hang Seng Commerce & Industry Index rose for the first
time in three days, climbing 0.7 percent. Citic Pacific rose 4.8
percent to HK$21.90. China Shenhua jumped 2.7 percent to
HK$34.35. China Coal Energy gained 1.6 percent to HK$11.64.  “The rebuilding process will drive demand for cement,
timber, steel, copper, aluminum, coking coal and telecom
equipment,” wrote analysts at UOB Kay Hian Holdings Ltd. in a
research report today.  Belle International retreated 2.4 percent to HK$13.70.  Orient Overseas (International) Ltd. rallied 10 percent to
HK$79.85, the biggest advance in the Hang Seng Composite Index.
The operator of Hong Kong’s biggest container line said it would
pay a $2.09 special dividend.  BYD Co. fell 1 percent to HK$34.60. The Chinese automaker
backed by  Warren Buffett  reported a 66 percent decline in
fourth-quarter profit after demand for its vehicles slumped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
