So-called “covenant-lite” loans,
which offer investors reduced safeguards, have made a comeback,
totalling almost $30 billion so far this year, the Financial
Times reported, citing Standard & Poor’s LCD, a research group.  Such loans proliferated before the financial crisis,
amounting to $24 billion in 2006 and $100 billion in 2007, the
newspaper said.    Dan Fuss , the vice chairman of money manager Loomis Sayles
& Co., commented that covenant-lite loans “are red flags for
weakening creditworthiness and they create a vulnerable
market,” the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
