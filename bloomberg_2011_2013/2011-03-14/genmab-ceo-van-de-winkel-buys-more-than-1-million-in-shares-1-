Genmab A/S Chief Executive Officer
Jan van de Winkel bought shares valued at more than $1 million
over the past two weeks, saying he wanted to show employees and
investors “confidence” in the Danish drugmaker.  “This is a pretty substantial investment and should be
seen as a strong sign of confidence,” van de Winkel said today
by phone. “This is a significant amount.”  Van de Winkel, who became CEO last year after the
Copenhagen-based drugmaker reported a record deficit for 2009,
has bought 110,000 shares for 5.74 million kroner ($1.08
million) since March 4. The executive said he now holds “just a
little under 2 percent” of Genmab, including warrants and
120,000 shares he already owned.  Regulatory requirements prevent van de Winkel from saying
whether he intends to buy more, he said. Investors and employees
will see in “due time” whether he acquires more shares, he
said.  Genmab fell March 1 to its lowest level in eight months on
the Copenhagen exchange after the Danish company forecast an
operating loss of as much as 400 million kroner this year. Jyske
Bank A/S expected a loss of 190 million kroner.  The company, which makes antibodies used in cancer
treatment, is seeking a partner to develop its tumor-righting
zalutumumab. Genmab also aims to find a buyer for its Minnesota
manufacturing plant within the year, van de Winkel said.  Genmab fell 1.70 kroner, or 3.3 percent, to 50.30 kroner,
its third straight day of losses. The stock has gained 3.7
percent since March 3, the day before van de Winkel began buying
shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
