Middle East crude oils for sale to  Asia  fell the most in more than two weeks after an earthquake in
Japan shut as much as a third of the country’s refining capacity.  Oman oil for immediate loading dropped $1.86, or 1.7
percent, to $107.15 a barrel at 4:07 p.m. in Singapore,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Dubai for loading in
May declined 1.7 percent to $106.92 a barrel and Murban crude
fell 1.5 percent to $110.94. Prices of the three grades dropped
the most since Feb. 25.  Japan was struck by an 8.9-magnitude temblor on March 11
that unleashed a 7-meter (23-foot) tsunami and may have killed
10,000 people in the north of the country. The disaster shut
about 1.3 million barrels a day of capacity, or 29 percent of
the country’s total of 4.516 million, based on data from the
Petroleum Association of  Japan .  Murban for May loading, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil
Co., gained 16 cents to a premium of 66 cents a barrel to its
official selling price, the highest since Jan. 5, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The grade, which yields large
amounts of gasoil, is becoming more valuable to refiners as
diesel processing profits climb.  Oman futures for May delivery were down $2.52 to $106.08 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange , with 1,039 contracts
traded. The settlement price was set at $106.55 a barrel at
12:30 p.m. Dubai time.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, or EFS, for April
narrowed 12 cents to $5.90 a barrel, according to data from
brokers PVM Oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
