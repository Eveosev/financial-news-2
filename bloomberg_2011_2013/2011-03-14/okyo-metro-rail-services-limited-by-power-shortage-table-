Tokyo Metro Co., the city’s biggest
subway operator, said it would reduce  service  to 50 percent of
normal to save electricity after the March 11 earthquake
crippled a nuclear power plant north of the city.  The reduction will come on all nine Tokyo Metro lines, some
of which had been operating at as much as 90 percent of normal
capacity today. East Japan Railways Co., the nation’s biggest
train operator also reduced services to save power and as some
of its lines are still damaged from the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami. Keisei Electric Railway Co. suspended its express
service to Narita International Airport after two runs this
morning.  Below is a list of Tokyo area train lines and their status
