  France ’s  CAC 40 Index (CAC)  slid 50.64,
or 1.3 percent, to 3,878.04 in Paris. The SBF 120 Index also
retreated 1.3 percent.  The following shares rose or fell in Paris. Stock symbols
are in parentheses.    Areva SA (CEI)  , the world’s largest maker of nuclear
reactors, sank 9.6 percent to 31.50 euros, declining the most in
more than two years. Electricite de France SA (EDF FP), the
biggest operator of nuclear reactors, tumbled 5.3 percent to
28.96 euros after an atomic power plant north of  Tokyo  suffered
a second hydrogen explosion in the aftermath of  Japan ’s
strongest earthquake on record.    Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  , France’s third-largest bank,
jumped 3.3 percent to 12.05 euros.  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA,
the country’s second-biggest lender, advanced 1.5 percent to
47.46 euros. JPMorgan Chase & Co. upgraded European bank stocks,
citing the industry’s recent underperformance and an earlier-
than-predicted policy package from the region’s leaders to stem
the sovereign-debt crisis.  The brokerage raised its recommendation on bank shares to
“overweight” and said investors should fund the change by
taking money out of energy stocks, according to a report today.
The leaders of the 17 euro nations agreed to let the European
Financial Stability Facility buy bonds directly from governments
and increased its size to 440 billion euros ($614.7 billion).    LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  , the world’s
largest maker of  luxury goods , declined 3.1 percent to 106.60
euros.  Hermes International (RMS)  SCA slipped 3.1 percent to
148.25 euros.  PPR (PP)  SA, the French owner of Gucci and
online retailer Redcats, slid 2.5 percent to 105.80 euros.
Luxury goods makers dropped on concern that sales in Japan will
suffer following the earthquake. Japan is the world’s second-
largest market for luxury goods after the U.S., accounting for
11 percent of global sales, according to consulting firm Bain &
Co.    Renault SA (RNO)  , France’s second-biggest carmaker,
slumped 6.3 percent to 38.18 euros. Renault’s mishandling of an
espionage investigation has weakened Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  in a tussle with the French state, its largest
shareholder, to decide the carmaker’s future, four people
familiar with the matter said.  Renault wants to reduce its 43 percent stake in Nissan
Motor Co. and grant the Japanese carmaker voting rights for its
14 percent holding in Renault, according to the same people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
