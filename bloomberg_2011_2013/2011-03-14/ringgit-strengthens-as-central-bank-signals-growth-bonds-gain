Malaysia’s ringgit strengthened the
most in almost two weeks after the central bank said it may
tighten monetary policy as economic growth stokes inflation.  The currency rebounded from its worst week in a month after  Bank Negara Malaysia  doubled the statutory  reserve ratio  for
banks to help soak up capital inflows on March 11, while not
changing its policy rate for a fourth meeting. The degree of
monetary accommodation may be reviewed given the sustained
growth in the economy and risks to inflation, the central bank
said.  Government bonds  gained after an auction.  “The central bank remains on the hawkish side and there
could still be some form of tightening ahead,” said D.
Sivadass, a currency forwards trader at EON Capital Bhd. in
Kuala Lumpur. “The trend is still for the ringgit to
strengthen.”  The ringgit gained 0.2 percent to 3.0391 per dollar as of
4:25 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency slid 0.6 percent last week, the most
since the five days ending Feb. 11, as a major earthquake in  Japan  sparked a regional stock slump. It may rise to 3.0280 this
week, Sivadass said.    Bank Negara  kept its  overnight rate  at 2.75 percent, in a
move predicted by 16 of 20 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The
central bank raised the reserve-ratio requirement for banks from
1 percent to 2 percent, effective from April 1. The ratio was
slashed from 4 percent after the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. caused credit markets to freeze in 2008.  Higher consumer and business spending are compensating for
weaker external demand, the central bank said.  Bond Auction  Five-year notes advanced after demand for the securities
increased compared with the previous sale of similar-maturity
debt as a slide in stocks boosted demand for the safest debt.  The treasury auctioned 4 billion ringgit ($1.3 billion) of
September 2016 notes in a reopening sale at an average yield of
3.567 percent. Demand exceeded the amount of debt offered by
2.24 times, compared with 1.92 times at the sale of five-year
bonds in August 2010.  The yield on the 2016 bonds fell 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.56 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.
The price rose 0.126, or 1.26 ringgit per 1,000 ringgit face
amount, to 103.45.  Today’s auction brought total bond issuances this year to
20.5 billion ringgit, compared with 15.5 billion ringgit at the
same time last year, according to official statistics. The
government is scheduled to sell Islamic bonds due 2014 later
this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
