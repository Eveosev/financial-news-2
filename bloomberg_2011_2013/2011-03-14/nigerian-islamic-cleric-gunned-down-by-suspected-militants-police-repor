A Nigerian Muslim cleric was shot
dead yesterday by suspected Islamic militants in the
northeastern city of Maiduguri, a police spokesman said.  At least four gunmen in a sport utility vehicle carried out
the attack on Ibrahim Ahmed Gomari at about 7 p.m. local time,
according to witnesses, spokesman Lawal Abdullahi said today by
phone from Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State.  Authorities in the region have blamed a radical Islamic
sect, Boko Haram, which draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s
Taliban movement, for a spate of killings targeting government
officials and the security forces in recent months.    Nigeria ,  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous
country of more than 140 million people, is roughly split
between a mainly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian
south. More than 14,000 people died in ethnic and religious
clashes in the West African nation between 1999 and 2009,
according to the Brussels-based  International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
