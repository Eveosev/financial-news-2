  Japan ’s shrinking share of global
output means the worst earthquake in the nation’s history will
have a limited effect on world growth, economists say.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows Japan’s contribution to world
gross domestic product has been shrinking since its peak in
1994. The world’s third-biggest economy accounted for $5.4
trillion, or 8.7 percent, of total GDP in 2010, when it ceded
its No. 2 position to  China .  The global economy is forecast to expand 4.4 percent this
year, after growing 5 percent in 2010, the fastest since 2007,
according to the Washington-based  International Monetary Fund .
Japan will grow 1.5 percent in 2011, the fifth-worst rate among
the world’s 24 developed nations, the IMF’s World Economic
Outlook said in October. The country’s real GDP expanded at an
average 0.8 percent annual pace in the past decade.  “From a global perspective, Japan has not been a
significant contributor to aggregate growth in recent years,”
said  Jim O’Sullivan , global chief economist at MF Global Inc. in  New York . It has been “generally lagging not just emerging
market countries but even other developed economies.”  The Bank of Japan poured a record 15 trillion yen ($183
billion) into the financial system to help stabilize the
country, which was hit by the temblor and subsequent tsunami
last week that killed an estimated 10,000 people.  O’Sullivan said natural disasters boost gross domestic
product after some initial disruption as rebuilding begins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
