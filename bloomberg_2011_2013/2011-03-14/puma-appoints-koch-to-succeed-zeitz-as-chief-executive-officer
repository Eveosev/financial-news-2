Puma AG,  Europe ’s second-largest
sporting-goods maker, appointed Franz Koch to succeed Chief
Executive Officer Jochen Zeitz, who will become chairman
of the supervisory board that will be formed when Puma changes
its corporate structure.  Koch, currently head of global strategy, will immediately
join Puma’s executive board as chief strategic officer, the
Herzogenaurach, Germany-based company said today in a statement.  Puma, controlled by French retailer  PPR SA (PP) , will  convert 
into a Societas Europaea if shareholders approve the plan at the
April 14 annual general meeting, the company said. Koch, 32,
joined Puma in 2007 from  Oliver Wyman , a management consulting
firm. Zeitz, who has been head of Puma for 18 years, is the
longest-serving CEO among companies on  Germany ’s DAX or MDAX
indexes.  “Having an exceptionally analytical yet most pragmatic
mind, Franz Koch has been one of the key drivers of Puma’s
strategic course and strongly contributed to our 2010 record
sales level,” Zeitz said in the statement.  There will be no changes to Puma’s strategy in the short
term, Koch said today on a conference call. Puma will focus
on tactical acquisitions only, PPR Chief Executive Officer
Francois-Henri Pinault said on the call. PPR owns about
71 percent of Puma.  Puma  declined  as much as 3.6 percent in Frankfurt trading
and was down 2.50 euros, or 1.2 percent, at 206.95 euros at
10:29 a.m. The MDAX index, which includes Puma, fell 0.9
percent, while PPR shares dropped 1.6 percent in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
