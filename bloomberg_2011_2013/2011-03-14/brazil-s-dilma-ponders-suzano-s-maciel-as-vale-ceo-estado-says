Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
may push major shareholders of  Vale SA (VALE5)  to name Suzano Papel e
Celulose SA’s Antonio Maciel Neto to replace Chief Executive
Officer Roger Agnelli, O Estado de S. Paulo reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Pension funds of government-controlled companies hold 49
percent of the iron-ore producer, the newspaper said today.
Maciel is currently the CEO of Suzano, Latin America’s second-
biggest pulp exporter.  An official at the Brazilian presidency in Brasilia wasn’t
immediately available to comment when called by Bloomberg News.
A Vale official in Rio de Janeiro, who declined to be named
citing corporate policy, said the company won’t comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
