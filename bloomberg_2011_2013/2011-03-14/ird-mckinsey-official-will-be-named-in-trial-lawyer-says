Raj Rajaratnam, the co-founder of
hedge fund Galleon Group LLC, tried to convince former McKinsey
& Co. employee David Palecek to “play ball” with him, a lawyer
representing Palecek’s wife said today.  Palecek’s name is expected to be named on an audiotape that
will be played today at the insider trading trial of Rajaratnam,
according to Catherine Redlich, a New York-based lawyer who
represents Palecek’s wife. Palecek, who was a classmate of
Rajaratnam’s brother Rengan, died last year, the lawyer said.  “What the tape does not reflect is that Mr. Palecek never
agreed to “play ball” with the Rajaratnams, never received
money from them, and never agreed to put his wife on Galleon’s
payroll,” Redlich said in a statement this morning.  Testimony in Rajaratnam is continuing this morning as
another ex-McKinsey partner,  Anil Kumar , testifies for the
government.  The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York    Manhattan ).  To contact the reporters on this story:
