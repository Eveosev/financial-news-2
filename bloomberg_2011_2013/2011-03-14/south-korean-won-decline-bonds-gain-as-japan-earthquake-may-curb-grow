  South Korea ’s won fell for a third
day and bonds gained on concern  Japan ’s worst earthquake on
record may slow global economic growth.  Exports and industrial production will probably be hurt by
an extended period of supply disruption following Japan’s
earthquake, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said in a
statement today. The March 11 earthquake in Japan, South Korea’s
third-largest single export market, may have killed more than
10,000 people.  “Japan’s earthquake can affect the Korean economy both
positively and negatively,” said Kim Sung Soon, a currency
dealer at Industrial Bank of Korea in  Seoul . “It could affect
it negatively if global growth slows. The Korean won will be
range-bound,” he said.  The won weakened 0.5 percent to 1,129.63 per dollar at the
3 p.m. close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Three-year  government bonds  gained for a fifth day, with the
yield on the 3 percent note due December 2013 dropping 5 basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.65 percent, according to
prices from Korea Stock Exchange. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The decline in the won may be limited as South Korea and
Japan compete in overseas markets in many industries such as
electronics and cars, said Kim. The benchmark  Kospi index (KOSPI) 
dropped as much as 1.4 percent before recovering to close 0.8
percent higher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
