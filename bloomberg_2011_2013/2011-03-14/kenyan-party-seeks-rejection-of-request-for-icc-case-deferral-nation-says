The Orange Democratic Movement, one
of the two political parties in  Kenya ’s ruling coalition, asked
the United Nations Security Council to reject the state’s
request for the postponement of cases facing six Kenyans at the
International Criminal Court, the Daily Nation reported.   ODM Secretary General Anyang Nyong’o said Kenya’s request
showed that President Mwai Kibaki and his Party of National
Unity were unwilling to punish those who committed crimes after
the country’s December 2007 presidential election, the Nairobi-
based newspaper reported today.   The party, whose leader is Prime Minister  Raila Odinga ,
provided 16 reasons for why the deferral should not be granted,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
