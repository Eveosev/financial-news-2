The European Union should regularly
review the terms of Ireland’s bailout and discuss other options
instead of demanding that it raise its corporate  tax rate ,
Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden said.  “We have to constantly review the pricing and maturity”
of the bailout loans, Frieden told reporters before a meeting
with euro-area counterparts in Brussels today. “I think there
can be other options that should be explored. Taxation is not an
aspect which is harmonized in Europe.”  At a meeting of European leaders on March 11, Irish Prime
Minister Enda Kenny refused to raise the country’s 12.5 percent
company tax rate in return for a 1 percent interest-rate cut on
the aid the EU is providing to Ireland.  “All things are linked to some extent,” Frieden said.
“So I find it normal that there will be discussions with the
Irish government as we had with the previous Irish government.”  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  refused to extend a cut in Greece’s borrowing
costs to Ireland as Kenny pushed back on taxes. Kenny’s
government, which took power last week, maintains that raising
the rate that has drawn companies including  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and
Pfizer Inc. would jeopardize the country’s economic recovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
