Trading of bearish options on
Japanese stocks jumped to a record in the U.S. as investors
bought protection against further losses after an 8.9-magnitude
earthquake hurt the world’s third-largest economy.  Almost 190,000 puts to sell the  iShares MSCI Japan Index
Fund (EWJ)  changed hands, more than 23 times the four-week average.
The ETF tracking 323 companies tumbled 7 percent to $10.05 for
the biggest slide since November 2008.  Investors paid higher prices for options after the
earthquake on March 11 caused a tsunami that killed thousands
and sparked the risk of a nuclear meltdown. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock
Average today fell to 6.2 percent to 9,620.49, the biggest
decline since December 2008.  “People are trying to protect their exposure,” said Steve Oh, an ETF sales trader at Newedge Group in New York. “We’ve
seen the fallout from the earthquake, the tsunami. But now the
new threat is the nuclear reactors. If there’s a nuclear
meltdown, that could further put a damper on  Japan ’s economic
prospects.”  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index, a measure of
Japanese option prices, jumped by a record 74 percent to 40.72.
The gauge, which is similar to the Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index for U.S. equity derivatives, has more
than doubled from this year’s low of 16.12 on Feb. 8.  The Japan ETF’s March $10 puts, today’s most traded puts,
soared fivefold to 20 cents for the fifth-biggest percentage
gain among all U.S. ETF options contracts. They accounted for
more than one-fourth of all put volume on the fund. March
options expire at the end of this week.  Nikkei put trading jumped to a record in Japan as traders
snapped up bearish contracts. More than 414,500 puts changed
hands on the Osaka Securities Exchange. The most-active
contracts were April 7,500 puts, which more than doubled to 85
yen. Japan’s benchmark equity index hasn’t closed below 7,500
since March 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
