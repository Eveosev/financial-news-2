Major economies in the  Association
of Southeast Asian Nations  are likely to maintain economic
growth momentum in the first quarter of this year, according to
the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.  Indonesia, the  Philippines  and Thailand have been supported
by exports, domestic demand and improving business sentiment, it
said. Inflationary pressures from surging oil and food prices
are posing an “important challenge” to policy makers in the
region, the OECD said.  Nations are facing the challenge of tightening interest-
rate policy to quell inflation while avoiding additional capital
inflows and maintaining competitiveness. Inflationary pressures
are also mounting in China and India, and “activity” in India is
showing some signs of slowing, the group said in its Asian
Business Cycle Indicators report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
