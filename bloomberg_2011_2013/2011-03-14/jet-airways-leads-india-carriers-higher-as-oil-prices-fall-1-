Jet Airways (India) Ltd., the
nation’s largest airline, led gains by local carriers after  oil
prices  fell to the lowest in about two weeks.  Jet climbed as much as 4.8 percent, the biggest intraday
jump since March 8, to 464.70 rupees and was at 462.25 rupees as
of 11:24 a.m. in Mumbai trading.  SpiceJet Ltd. (SJET) , the nation’s
biggest listed discount carrier, rose as much as 4.2 percent and  Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. (KAIR)  gained as much as 3.2 percent.  Oil dropped below $100 in New York trading on concern that
an 8.9-magnitude earthquake in Japan will limit demand in the
world’s third-largest economy. Fuel accounts for about 25
percent of Jet’s operating costs, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Any softening in prices helps them,” said Shumukh Ghosh,
an analyst at Mumbai-based Naman Securities & Finance Pvt.
“Crude is such an important component of the airlines’ costs.”  Oil for April delivery fell as much as $1.98, or 2 percent,
to $99.18 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
lowest intraday price since March 1. It was at $99.58 at 1:36
p.m. Singapore time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
