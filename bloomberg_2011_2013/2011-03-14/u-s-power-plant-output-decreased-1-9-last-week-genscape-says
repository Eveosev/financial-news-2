U.S. power-plant output fell 1.9
percent during the week ended March 10, according to an analysis
by  Genscape Inc.   Genscape says it calculates weekly total generation using a
multiple regression approach that includes power output measured
at more than 280 monitored plants and publicly available
electric demand data.  Output at plants monitored by Genscape accounts for about
46 percent of all U.S. electricity generation. The calculation
yields results with an absolute average error of less than 2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
