Borders Group Inc. hopes to exit
bankruptcy by August or September by starting early on its plan
to identify 200 of its superstores for closure, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing an interview with President Mike
Edwards.  The bookseller is looking at closing an extra 75 stores and
wants to present a business plan to creditors, including
publishers, by early April; the final number of extra story
closures may depend on talks with landlords, Edwards told the
newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
