  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.’s plans to
implement rolling blackouts following Japan’s strongest
earthquake on record may cut the nation’s gross domestic product
by about 0.29 percent, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  The power cuts, which may last until the end of April to
pare a supply shortfall of 25 percent, may cut GDP contributions
from the electric power industry in the Kanto region by 90
billion yen, wrote economists Takahide Kiuchi and Ryota Takemoto
in a Nomura report today. While the direct impact from the
sector is small, the ripple effects from the cuts on other
industries may reduce nominal GDP by around 0.29 percent, the
report said.  “Although we think these estimates could end up being on
the high side, we would caution that power cuts are bound to
have a negative impact on the Japanese economy,” Kiuchi and
Takemoto wrote.  Workers battled to prevent a nuclear meltdown after a
second hydrogen explosion rocked an atomic plant north of Tokyo,
while officials said the death toll from the nation’s strongest
earthquake may top 10,000 following the 8.9-magnitude temblor on
March 11 and subsequent tsunami. Tokyo Electric Power,  Asia ’s
largest utility, is flooding two reactors at the plant with
water and boric acid to avert a catastrophic release of
radiation.  A 25 percent cut in the power supply may hurt production in
the manufacturing sector by 2.5 percent, 5 percent for the non-
manufacturing sector and 10 percent for the financial,
insurance, information and telecommunications sectors, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
