Thailand’s baht appreciated to its
strongest level in more than two months as a slide in crude-oil
prices eased concern inflation will accelerate and hurt growth
in  Southeast Asia ’s second-biggest economy.  The baht advanced by the most since Jan. 31 as fuel prices
fell 2 percent in  New York . The currency rose for the first time
in three days on speculation the Bank of Thailand will add to
this year’s two interest-rate increases.  “Falling oil prices ease concern about inflationary
pressures, supporting regional currencies,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a global economist at Mizuho Securities Co. in  Tokyo .
“The baht sees appreciation pressure also from prospects of a
rate hike.”  The baht climbed 0.3 percent to 30.36 per dollar as of 3:21
p.m. in Bangkok and touched 30.22, the strongest level since
Jan. 7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
may appreciate to near 30 by the end of this month, Hayashi
said.  The Bank of  Thailand  still needs to keep lifting rates,
Assistant Governor Paiboon Kittisrikangwan said on March 9 after
the bank announced its fifth increase in the benchmark rate
since June. The bank boosted the one-day bond repurchase rate by
a quarter of a percentage point to 2.50 percent that day.  The core consumer price index rose 1.45 percent last month,
the most since March 2009, government data show. The central
bank uses the core index, which excludes fresh food and fuel
prices, to guide policy, and aims to keep the rate below 3
percent.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, fell 10.5 basis points to
2.625 percent.  The yield on the 3.125 percent bond due December 2015 was
little changed at 3.35 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
