  Boeing Co. (BA) , which relies on
Japanese contractors for about 35 percent of 787 Dreamliner’s
structure, said the disruptions caused by an earthquake in  Japan 
have so far had no impact on output.  The major subcontractors for the Chicago-based company,
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd.
and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., all have their main operations
in Nagoya, which is in the south of Japan, Boeing spokesman
Charlie Miller said by phone today. It’s still “early days” to
assess the final fallout from the quake, he said. Boeing has 200
employees in Japan, and they are all accounted for.  Boeing’s ties to Japan stretch back to the country’s post-
World War II reconstruction, and local manufacturers have
traditionally played a major role on aircraft for the company.
Japanese contractors also supplied 20 percent of parts for
Boeing’s 777 in the early 1990s and 15 percent on the earlier
767. Japanese airlines were major customers for both.  The Dreamliner, which is more than three years behind its
original delivery schedule, gets its center wing box from Fuji,
and its landing gear wheel well from Kawasaki. Mitsubishi also
contributes to the wings. Miller referred all detailed questions
on the aircraft to spokeswoman Lori Gunter in  Seattle .  To contact the reporter on this story:
