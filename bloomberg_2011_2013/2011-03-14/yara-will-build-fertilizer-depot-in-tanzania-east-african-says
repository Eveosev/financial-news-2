  Yara International ASA (YAR) ’s Tanzanian
unit plans to start building a $20 million fertilizer terminal
in the East African country in August as domestic farmers seek
to boost crop yields, the  East African  reported.  The depot, to be built at the port city of  Dar es Salaam ,
will have a 45,000 metric-ton storage capacity, the Nairobi-
based newspaper reported today, citing Wayne Forbes, managing
director of the Tanzanian unit. Fertilizer kept at the facility
will also be sold to neighboring Rwanda and Burundi, it said.  Yara, based in Oslo, Norway, is the world’s largest
publicly traded nitrogen-fertilizer maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
