The cost of protecting Japanese
sovereign and corporate bonds from default surged after the
nation’s most powerful earthquake on record, credit-default swap
prices show.  Swaps on Japanese government debt rose 7.5 basis points to
86 basis points as of 8:26 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. That’s the biggest increase since Nov. 30 and the highest
level since Jan. 18, prices from data provider CMA show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index soared 21.5 basis points to
119 basis points as of 8:54 a.m. in Tokyo, the biggest rise
since May 25 and the highest level since Aug. 16, according to
Deutsche Bank AG and CMA in  New York .  The 8.9-magnitude temblor on March 11 and subsequent
tsunami may have killed 10,000 in Miyagi prefecture north of
Tokyo, national broadcaster NHK reported, citing local police.
The official toll reached 1,597, with 1,481 more missing and
1,683 injured, the  National Police Agency  said. More than
350,000 people are in emergency shelters.  Radiation levels around the Tokyo Electric Power Co.
station in Fukushima, 135 miles (217 kilometers) north of the
capital, rose after cooling systems at a second reactor failed,
heightening concerns about a possible meltdown following an
explosion there March 13. Water levels fell at a third reactor,
raising the possibility of a hydrogen explosion,  Japan ’s top
government spokesman said.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on  credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
