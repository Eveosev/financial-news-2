Trading of bullish  Lubrizol Corp. (LZ) 
options surged to the highest level in a year on March 9, before  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) ’s offer today to buy the world’s largest
producer of lubricant additives lifted the shares 28 percent.  Call trading surged to 2,931 contracts on March 9, and open
interest for the April $110 calls jumped to 2,654 from 41. A
block of 2,168 April $110 calls traded for $2.35 each on March
9, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Lubrizol’s four-week average
trading volume is 413. The April $110 calls advanced almost 11-
fold to $24.70 today. The Wickliffe, Ohio-based company surged
28 percent to $134.68.  “That is more than suspicious,” said Ophir Gottlieb, head
of client services at Livevol Inc., a San Francisco-based
provider of options market analytics. “It looks like a naked
purchase of calls, and that’s highly suspicious if not straight
insiders trading.”  Berkshire, owned by billionaire  Warren Buffett , today
agreed to buy Lubrizol for about $9 billion in the investor’s
second-biggest acquisition in the past five years. Berkshire
will pay $135 a share in cash, 28 percent more than Lubrizol’s
closing price on March 11, the Omaha, Nebraska-based company
said in a statement today. The purchase includes an additional
$700 million of net debt.  Calls for Comment  Julie Young, a spokeswoman for Lubrizol, didn’t immediately
return a call for comment. Buffett didn’t respond to a request
for comment e-mailed to his assistant,  Carrie Kizer .    Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR)  were financial
advisers to Lubrizol, while Jones Day was legal counsel. Munger,
Tolles & Olson LLP was legal counsel for Berkshire.  Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for Citigroup, and
Dana Gorman, a spokesman for Evercore, declined to comment. Mary
Ann Todd, the lead partner at Munger, and Dave Petrou, a
spokesman for  Jones Day , didn’t immediately return calls.  Lubrizol call volume rose to a record today. More than
20,000 calls changed hands, 49 times the four-week average and
five times the number of puts to sell. The most-traded contracts
were the September $135 calls, which accounted for more than
four-tenths of all call volume. A block of 2,650 April $110
calls traded at 9:51 a.m.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Investors use
options to guard against fluctuations in the price of securities
they own, speculate on share-price moves or bet that volatility,
or stock swings, will rise or fall.  To contact the reporters on this story:
