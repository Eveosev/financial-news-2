Corn prices fell in  South Africa ,
the continent’s largest producer of the grain, as a forecast for
rain in growing areas bolstered prospects for yields.  The  South African Weather Service  predicted showers and
thunderstorms across the provinces of Mpumalanga, the biggest
producer of yellow corn, and Free State, where most of the
nation’s white-corn crop is grown. Rain fell in Free State and
Mpumalanga during the 24 hours to 8 a.m. local time, the service
said on its website.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract on
the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg, fell 23
rand, or 1.5 percent, to end trade at 1,520 rand ($221) a metric
ton. Meal made from the grain is the country’s staple food.  “It’s because of the rain in Free State and Mpumalanga,”
Henriku Delport, a trader at Bushveld Grain Ltd., said by phone
from South Africa’s capital,  Pretoria . “It’s also because the
rand is stronger,” Delport said, after the rand strengthened
against the dollar, cutting the cost of imports for local
millers.  The rand traded at 6.8704 a dollar at 12:12 p.m. in
Johannesburg, compared with 6.9387 at the close of grain trading
at noon on March 11.  Yellow corn for July delivery dropped 32 rand, or 2
percent, to 1,560 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as  animal
feed  in South Africa.  Wheat for May delivery declined 22 rand, or 0.7 percent, to
2,970 rand a ton.  Gains or losses for the most active contracts of the
following crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold per ton:  To contact the reporter on this story:
