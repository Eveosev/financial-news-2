Open Finance SA, the consumer
financial advisory company controlled by Polish billionaire
Leszek Czarnecki, will start selling 482.6 million zloty ($167
million) of shares tomorrow in an initial public offering, the
country’s biggest in five months.  Book building, the process of determining the issue price
by ascertaining the levels at which investors are prepared to
buy, will end on March 22, according to a prospectus published
on Open Finance’s  website  today. The company plans to start
trading on the  Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW)  on April 5, it said. The
offering of a 46 percent stake would be the largest IPO in  Poland  since the Warsaw Stock Exchange’s 1.2 billion-zloty sale
in October.    Getin Noble Bank SA (GNB) , owned by Czarnecki’s Getin Holding SA,
is selling 20.5 million shares while Open Finance will offer an
additional 4.25 million new shares to raise funds for
acquisitions and expand its network of outlets. The maximum
price for individual investors was set at 19.5 zloty per share,
Getin Noble said in a statement on March 12.  More than $10 billion of shares were sold in Poland last
year, the biggest amount since the Warsaw bourse was created 20
years ago, as the government sped up asset sales to help finance
the  budget deficit  and private companies sought funds for
expansion. Of the eighty-six share sales in Poland last year, 69
were IPOs, Bloomberg data showed.  Last year’s sales included a 478 million-zloty offering by
TU Europa SA, Czarnecki’s insurer, and Getin Noble Bank, and the
8.1 billion zloty offering of state-controlled insurer PZU SA,
the country’s largest IPO on record.  Getin Noble Bank shares declined 0.4 percent to 6.77 zloty
at 10:56 a.m. in Warsaw after gaining 2.2 percent earlier.  Getin
Holding SA (GTN)  added 0.2 percent to 13.39 zloty, while Europa
slipped 0.1 percent to 209.3 zloty.  Open Finance’s sale is managed by UniCredit CAIB Poland SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
