  Peru ’s Congress pledged to vote
this week on legislation that seeks to improve miners’ pension
benefits and profit-sharing, a union leader said.  Mining unions agreed to suspend a vote on a national strike
this month, said Luis Castillo, general secretary of the
Federation of Mining and Steel Workers. The group, representing
28,000 workers and 70 unions, is pushing Congress to boost
pensions and workers’ share of profits to 10 percent from 8
percent.  “We have Congress’s commitment to voting on these two
issues,” Castillo said today in a telephone interview. “We
have called off all labor action to give them time to pass the
legislation.”  Miners in Peru have staged three national strikes in the
past three years, seeking a bigger slice of record earnings
after both copper and gold rose to all-time highs. Copper has
more than doubled in the past two years, while gold jumped 54
percent and touched a record $1,445.70 an ounce on March 7.  Congresswoman Cecilia Chacon, head of the congressional
Energy & Mines Committee, didn’t immediately return a telephone
call and an e-mail to her office seeking comment.  Copper futures for May delivery fell 0.5 percent to settle
at $4.1865 a pound on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ’s Comex
division, while gold rose 0.2 percent to $1,424.90 an ounce.
Zinc for delivery in three months increased $55, or 2.4 percent,
to $2,330 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Alex Emery  in  Lima  at
