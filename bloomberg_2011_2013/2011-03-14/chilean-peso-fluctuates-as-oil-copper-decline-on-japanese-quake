  Chile ’s peso sank as copper, the
country’s biggest export, fell on concern that the Japanese
earthquake will limit demand.  The peso slid 0.5 percent to 481.13 per  U.S. dollar  from
478.95 on March 11. It earlier gained 0.1 percent to 478.46.  Copper for May delivery declined as much as 1.6 percent to
$4.14 a pound and West Texas crude oil for April delivery
declined as much as 2.7 percent to $98.47 a barrel.  Japan  is the
second-largest buyer of Chilean copper after  China  and ahead of
the U.S. and  South Korea , according to central bank data.  “What happened in Japan is hitting stocks and
commodities,” said Eugenio Cortes, head of currency forwards at
EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “In the short
term that will mean the peso weakening. It had already been
falling because of weaker copper. It may go as far as 485 per
dollar.”  Copper makes up more than half of Chile’s exports. The  MSCI
World (MXWO)  Index of global stocks slid 1.4 percent today to 1296.57.  Foreign investors reduced bets on the peso weakening
against the dollar to $1.2 billion on March 10 from $2.3 billion
on March 9, according to central bank data, the biggest shift
since at least the beginning of last year.  Chilean interest-rate swaps were mixed today ahead of a
central bank meeting on March 17. Three-month interest-rate
swaps in pesos gained three basis points to 4.03 percent, the
highest in a year. The one-year swap rate in pesos declined for
a third day, falling one basis point to 5.03 percent.  The two-year breakeven inflation rate slid five basis
points to 4.1 percent. The rate, which reflects traders’ views
of average future price rises, has fallen from 4.62 percent a
week ago as the price of oil declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
