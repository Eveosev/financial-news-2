join National Bank of Ras al Khaimah, two people familiar with
the matter said.  Reuters reported earlier today Khumri will help start an
Islamic branch at RAKBank. The bank’s spokeswoman declined to
comment when reached by telephone. She would not be named
because of company policy.  An ADCB spokesman, who declined to be identified because of
