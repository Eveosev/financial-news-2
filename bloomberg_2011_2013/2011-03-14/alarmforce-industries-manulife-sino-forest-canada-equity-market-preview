Canadian stocks fell for a second
day, led by precious-metal producers, as some investors sold
metals to raise cash following declines in world equity markets.    Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest producer, dropped
2.4 percent as the metal dropped the most since Jan. 4.  Teck
Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) ,  Canada ’s biggest base-metal and coal producer,
rose 4.3 percent after the U.S. Federal Reserve said the
recovery is gaining strength.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , which
had 120 life insurance sales offices in  Japan  on Dec. 31, lost
4.2 percent as the costs of the country’s earthquake mounted.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index declined 72.23
points, or 0.5 percent, to 13,546.96, the lowest level since Jan
31. The S&P/TSX has retreated 4.2 percent this month after eight
months of gains.  “People are uncertain about what’s going to happen in
Japan,” said David Baskin, president of Toronto-based money
manager Baskin Financial Services Inc., which manages about
C$400 million ($406 million). “They’re worried, so they’re
fleeing to safety. They’re buying U.S. dollars, U.S. Treasury
bills and selling pretty much everything else.”  The Canadian stock benchmark fell 4.1 percent last week as
the U.S. reported an increase in initial jobless claims and oil
dropped from a post-2008 high. The index sank as much as 2.8
percent in the first five minutes of trading today on concern
the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear emergency in Japan will
cripple Canada’s fourth-biggest export market.  Crisis Continues  Shoppers grabbed water, food and batteries from store
shelves in  Tokyo  as the death count from last week’s events
climbed to 2,734. A third explosion occurred at the nuclear
power plant north of the city where the cooling system failed
after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Commodity Price Index
declined the most in four months. Gold dropped 2.3 percent to
$1,392.80 an ounce in  New York .  Barrick slipped 2.4 percent to C$48.45.  Semafo Inc. (SMF) , which
mines gold in  Africa , declined 5.4 percent to C$8.08 a day
before it is to release fourth-quarter financial results. Silver
reseller  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW)  lost 3.7 percent to C$39.06 as
that metal decreased 4.8 percent.    Alamos Gold Inc. (AGI) , which mines in  Mexico , retreated 6.3
percent to C$15.86 after saying it crushed less ore in January
and February than it had planned. This should lead to a smaller
profit than previously forecast for the first quarter, Anita Soni, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a note to
clients.  Renaissance Jeopardized    Uranium One Inc. (UUU) , a mining company controlled by Moscow-
based ARMZ Uranium Holding, fell 14 percent to C$3.72 as the
Japanese crisis jeopardized a renaissance in nuclear power. The
shares have plunged 37 percent this week.  Producers of other raw materials rebounded after the Fed’s
Open Market Committee, for the first time since September,
issued a statement that did not call the recovery
“disappointingly slow.”  Teck gained 4.3 percent from a three-month low to C$51.71.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s second-largest publicly
traded copper producer, advanced 2.3 percent to C$113.71 before
the scheduled release of its fourth-quarter financial results.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s biggest
fertilizer producer by market value, climbed 2.7 percent to
C$53.14 after touching a 2011 intraday low.  ‘Overdone’  “The market’s saying the selloff has been overdone;
agricultural fundamentals remain strong,”  Edlain Rodriguez , a
New York-based analyst with Gleacher & Co., said today in a
telephone interview. “We’ve seen sell-offs like this before,
and then the rebound as people come to their senses.”  Thirty-five of 43 stocks in the S&P/TSX Financials Index
declined. The  Bank of Japan  has injected 23 trillion yen ($284
billion) into money markets this week to try to contain
investors’ panic.  Manulife,  North America ’s fourth-largest insurer, lost 4.2
percent to C$16.04 even after saying it doesn’t expect property
and casualty reinsurance claims related to the earthquake and
tsunami to be material to full-year results.    Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s largest lender by
assets, decreased 0.8 percent to C$59.58.  Thomson Reuters Corp. (TRI) ,
the financial news and information provider, retreated 2.6
percent to C$37.86.  Aerospace and defense contractor MacDonald, Dettwiler &
Associates Ltd. surged 7.5 percent, the most since Oct. 28, to
C$52.63 after winning an agreement the parties valued at more
than $280 million to service Intelsat SA satellites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
