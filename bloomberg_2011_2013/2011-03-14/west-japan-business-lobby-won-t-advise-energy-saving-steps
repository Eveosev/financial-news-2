Hiroshi Shimozuma, chairman of the
 Kansai Economic Federation , comments on the earthquake in
northern  Japan . The group, Japan’s second-biggest business lobby,
represents more than 1,400 companies and organizations including
Panasonic Corp. and Sharp Corp. in the country’s western Kansai
region.  Shimozuma, who is also chairman of Sumitomo Metal
Industries Ltd., spoke today at a news conference in Osaka.  On request for cutting electricity consumption:  “We have no intention to ask our members to cut power
consumption after the earthquake because western Japan hasn’t
been affected much and there is sufficient power supply. Also,
there is a difference in the frequency level for power supplied
in western and eastern Japan, so it would be difficult to
transfer electricity even if we save energy in this region.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
