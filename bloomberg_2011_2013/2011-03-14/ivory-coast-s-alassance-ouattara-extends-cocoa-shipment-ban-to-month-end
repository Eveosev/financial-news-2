Ivory Coast’s  Alassane Ouattara ,
the internationally recognized winner of a disputed presidential
election, extended a ban on cocoa exports until the end of the
month, said Malick Tohe, an adviser to his administration.   “The ban has been extended until March 31,” Tohe said in
an interview today from the commercial capital, Abidjan.
Ouattara on Jan. 24 imposed the ban to cut off  tax revenue  to
incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo , who refuses to step down.   All major cocoa exporters in Ivory Coast, the world’s
biggest producer of the crop, have heeded the ban. About 440,000
metric tons of cocoa are currently stored in exporters’
warehouses near the port of Abidjan, said Tohe.   In a bid to collect export taxes and resume shipments,
Gbagbo on March 7 said he took control of cocoa purchases and
exports. Four days later, the Gbagbo-controled national cocoa
management committee in a statement warned exporters that
undeclared cocoa bean stocks would be seized.  To contact the reporter on this story:
