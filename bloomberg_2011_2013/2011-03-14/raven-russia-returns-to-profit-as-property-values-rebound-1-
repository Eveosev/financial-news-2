  Raven Russia Ltd. (RUS)  returned to
profit last year as the value of its warehouses in Moscow and  St. Petersburg  increased and demand for space rose.  Net income was $41.5 million, or 7.4 cents a share, last
year, compared with a loss of $139.3 million, or 28.5 cents, a
year earlier, the Guernsey-registered company said in a
statement today.  “Russia is getting better more quickly than people
thought,” Chief Executive Officer Glyn Hirsch said in a
telephone interview. “Rents are going up and we are slowly
starting to build again.”  The recovery of the Russian economy meant the availability
of warehouse space has shrunk. Developers, including Raven
Russia, stopped constructing logistics buildings in 2009
following the financial crisis. Raven  Russia  now has only 5
percent of its total space available after leasing 220,000
square meters (2.4 million square feet) this year.  Retailers are leading the demand for space, and Raven
Russia is building more space in the Moscow region as the
capital is leading the country’s economic recovery, Hirsch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
