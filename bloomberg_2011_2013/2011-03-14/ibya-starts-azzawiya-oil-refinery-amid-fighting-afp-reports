  Libya ’s Azzawiya oil refinery
resumed operations after shutting because of the conflict in the
North African country, Agence France Presse  reported .  The refinery near the capital, Tripoi, reached normal
production levels late on March 10, the news agency reported on
its website two days ago, citing Shokri Ghanem, chairman of
Libya’s state-run National Oil Corp. Ghanem did not respond
today to calls to his mobile phone by Bloomberg News.  Azzawiya is the country’s second-largest refinery, with a
capacity to process 120,000 barrels of crude a day. The plant
was closed because of fighting, Abdeljalil Mayuf, manager of
Arabian Gulf Oil Co.’s information department, said March 7.  To contact the reporters on this story:
