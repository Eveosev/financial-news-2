The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options jumped, as global stocks slid on concern  Japan ’s biggest
earthquake on record will hurt economic growth.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, advanced 5.2 percent to 21.13 today, after
earlier gaining as much as 13 percent to 22.74. The index
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which retreated 0.6 percent
to 1,296.39. Oil dipped below $99 a barrel before settling
nearly unchanged at $101.19.  VIX March futures gained 1.9 percent to 21.70. The most-
active VIX options were the May 30 calls, which accounted for a
fifth of all call volume and rose 4.2 percent to $1.25.  In  Europe , the benchmark gauge of stock-market volatility
surged for a fourth day. The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the
cost of protecting against a decline in shares on the Euro Stoxx
50 Index, jumped 8.2 percent to 26.74 in  Frankfurt . The Euro
Stoxx 50 stock index fell 1.1 percent to 2,852.11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
