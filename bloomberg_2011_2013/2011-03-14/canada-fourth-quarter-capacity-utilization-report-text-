The following is the text of  Canada 's capacity utilization report for the fourth
quarter
released by  Statistics Canada .  Canadian industries operated at 76.4% of their
production capacity in the fourth quarter, up slightly
from 76.2% in the third quarter. This was the sixth
consecutive quarterly increase in the rate, although the
pace of growth slowed progressively during 2010.  Overall capacity utilization rates for both
manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors recorded
slight changes in the fourth quarter.  For 2010 as a whole, capacity use in Canadian
industries intensified to 75.8% from 71.3% in 2009.  Manufacturing: Little overall change  Canada's manufacturers operated at 76.7% capacity in
the fourth quarter, virtually unchanged from 76.8% in the
previous quarter, following five consecutive quarterly
increases.  Utilization rates rose in 11 of the 21 major
manufacturing industries in the fourth quarter.  Among the industries that recorded an increase, the
ones that contributed most were computer and electronic
products, machinery, paper, clothing and fabricated
metals. These were offset by declines in the
transportation equipment, primary metals, food, chemicals
and beverage industries.  Capacity use in the computer and electronic products
industry rose from 87.0% in the third quarter to 97.0% in
the fourth quarter, one of the highest rates ever for this
industry. This increase was mainly the result of higher
production of communications equipment.  Capacity use in machinery manufacturing reached 79.3%,
up from 76.9%. This growth was due to increased production
of construction, mining and oil and gas field machinery,
as well as commercial and service industry machinery.  In the  paper industry , capacity use rose from 85.0% to
87.0%, as a result of higher output from pulp mills and
paperboard mills.  Non-manufacturing: Capacity use increases in the oil and
gas extraction industry  Among non-manufacturing industries, fourth-quarter
utilization rates were either stable or underwent moderate
change.  Capacity use in the oil and gas extraction industry
rose from 81.4% in the third quarter to 83.9% in the
fourth quarter.  In the forestry and logging industry, the rate of
capacity use declined from 92.9% to 91.6% in the fourth
quarter. However, this was still one of the highest rates
in the last five years.  The rate of capacity use in the mining sector,
excluding oil and gas extraction, remained unchanged at
68.8%. Increased activity in metal ore and non-metallic
mineral mining was offset by weakness in support
activities.  Capacity utilization in the  construction industry  also
stayed unchanged, its rate remaining at 73.2%. The decline
in residential construction was offset by a pickup in
engineering construction activity.  In the electric power generation, transmission and
distribution industry, the utilization rate was nearly
unchanged at 76.7% as production remained stable.  Annual 2010: Capacity use up  Canadian industries operated at 75.8% capacity in 2010,
up from 71.3% in 2009. Despite this increase, the 2010
rate was still below the rate of 77.5% in 2008.  Among manufacturing industries, annual capacity use
strengthened to 76.2% in 2010, from 70.9% in 2009 and
75.6% in 2008. However, the 2010 rate was lower than the
2007 rate of 82.8%.  Capacity use also increased strongly in 2010 in
forestry and logging, mining, and in transportation
equipment and non-metallic mineral products manufacturing.  Some industries declined moderately in their capacity
use in 2010. These are electric power generation,
transmission and distribution, and manufacturers in
electrical equipment, appliances and components, printing
and related support activities, beverage, food, and
plastic products.  Note to readers  The industrial capacity utilization rate is the ratio
of an industry's actual output to its estimated potential
output. For most industries, the annual estimates are
obtained from the Capital and Repair Expenditures survey
while the quarterly distribution is derived from output-to-
capital ratio series, the output being the real gross
domestic product at factor cost, seasonally adjusted, by
industry.  This program covers all manufacturing and selected non-
manufacturing industries.  With this release, rates have been revised back to the
first quarter of 2008 to reflect updated source data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
