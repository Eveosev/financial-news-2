An increase in Czech  interest rates 
by a quarter of a percentage point would be “adequate” now
because of “significant” risks that inflation may start to
accelerate, central bank board member Kamil Janacek told  Reuters 
in an interview.  The rate should rise even with the “unimpressive”
economic data published last week, Janacek told Reuters in the
interview published today.  The policy maker, who joined the Czech National Bank nine
months ago, won’t be present at the bank’s next voting session,
the newswire added.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
