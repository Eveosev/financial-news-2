  China  has overtaken the U.K. to
become the world’s second-largest art market after the U.S.,
according to research published today.  Auction and gallery sales in China totaled the equivalent
of almost 6 billion euros ($8.3 billion) in 2010, giving the
country a 23 percent share of the global market, said the
 British Art Market Federation . The U.S. continues to dominate,
with 34 percent. The U.K. remains Europe’s biggest auction
center, with 22 percent of international sales.  The full survey is scheduled to be released later today by
the Netherlands-based European Fine Art Foundation three days
before the world’s largest art and antiques fair, Tefaf,
previews in the Dutch city of Maastricht.  Since 2006, the U.K.’s share of the global art market has
fallen to 22 percent from 27 percent, the BAMF said in an e-
mailed statement.  Europe ’s share has fallen even more sharply.  “This study makes alarming reading for us,” said Anthony Browne, BAMF’s chairman, in the statement.  He warns that sales are being damaged by a European Union
levy that entitles living artists to a portion of the resale
value of their work. “The EU alone applies this levy,” he
said. “It does not exist in China, the U.S. or  Switzerland , our
main global competitors.”  Levy Extension  The levy was introduced in the U.K. in 2006 under a
European Union directive. The BAMF was set up in 1996 to
represent the interests of Britain’s auction houses and art
trade associations. It’s campaigning against European Commission
plans to extend the levy in the U.K. in 2012 to the work of
deceased artists 70 years after their deaths.  The European Fine Art Foundation’s study “The
International Art Market in 2010: Crisis and Recovery” comes as
more than 260 dealers prepare for  Tefaf . The event will offer
30,000 works with a total value of more than 1 billion euros,
said insurers.  International sales of art and antiques totaled 43 billion
euros in 2010, a 52 percent increase on 2009, when the market
suffered from economic worries and sluggish growth, the Tefaf 
report said.  The recovery was strongest in the U.S. and China. Art sales
in the latter have nearly doubled in value since 2009, according
to the report, prepared by Clare McAndrew, founder of the
Dublin-based consulting company Arts Economics. The headline
figures combine transactions made by both dealers and auction
houses.  Modern and contemporary art represented 58 percent of the
2010 sales with pre-1950 pieces accounting for six times the
value of more recent works. The auction sector has become
dependent on individual lots selling for more than 50,000 euros.  Results such as the record $106.5 million paid for
Picasso’s 1932 “Nude,  Green Leaves  and Bust” accounted for 81
percent of the market by value, though only 5 percent by volume.  “Buyers were seeking higher quality or well-established
works, whereas sales in the middle of the market were recovering
more slowly,” the report said.  The Tefaf preview for VIPs is on Thursday March 17.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
