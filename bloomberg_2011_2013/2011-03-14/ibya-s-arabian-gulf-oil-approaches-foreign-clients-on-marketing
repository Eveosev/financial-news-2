  Libya ’s Arabian Gulf Oil Co. has
contacted its foreign clients to discuss direct marketing of
crude and oil products instead of via its state-owned parent
company, a company official said today.  The company, also known as Agoco, split from its parent
company, Tripoli-based National Oil Corp., a few days after
uprisings broke out in Libya. Agoco said at the time it was
siding with the protesters.  “We are in touch with our clients to arrange the
marketing,” Hassan Bolifa, member of the management committee,
said by phone from Benghazi today. “A special committee has
been formed but no agreement has yet been reached.”  Eastern Libya, home to most of the country’s crude
reserves, has come under the control of rebels demanding an end
to leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s four-decade rule following mass
demonstrations that began on Feb. 17. The territory between the
North African country’s eastern border with  Egypt  and the area
to the east of the oil town of Brega is claimed by the
opposition who are represented by the Benghazi-based
Transitional National Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
