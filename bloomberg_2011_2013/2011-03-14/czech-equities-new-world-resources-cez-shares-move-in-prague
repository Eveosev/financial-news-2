The Czech Republic’s benchmark PX
stock index retreated 0.7 percent to 1,208.1 at 4:28 p.m., its
lowest close in almost three months.  The following were among the most active equities on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.    Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV)   slid 2.2
percent to 341 koruna, its lowest close since March 2, after the
broadcaster said Chief Executive Officer Adrian Sarbu sold
100,000 shares in the company last week.    CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest power utility, fell
0.7 percent to 803 koruna, its lowest close since March 2. CEZ
may face a lawsuit from its brown-coal supplier, Sokolovska
Uhelna, which claims it faces discrimination over price,
Hospodarske Noviny reported, citing Sokolovska’s Chief Executive
Officer Frantisek Stepanek.    New World Resources NV (NWR)  , the largest Czech supplier
of coal to steelmakers, increased 2.2 percent to 264.2 koruna,
ending a six-day selloff.  Europe ’s benchmark coal derivatives
jumped for a second day in Amsterdam to $127.25 per metric ton,
the highest price since October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
