South African consumer confidence
declined in the first quarter, falling back to levels last seen
at the end of 2009, led lower by high-income earners.  The FNB/BER consumer confidence index was 9, compared with
14 in the fourth quarter of 2010,  First National Bank  and the
Bureau for Economic Research said in an e-mailed statement
today. “Fewer consumers expect the economy and their own
finances to improve over the next 12 months,” FNB and BER said.    Consumer spending , which accounts for two-thirds of
expenditure in the economy, has been slow to recover from a 2009
recession.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
