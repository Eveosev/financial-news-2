The renewal of the natural gas flow
from Egypt to  Israel  has been furthered delayed by the discovery
of a leak in the pipeline, Calcalist reported, without saying
how it obtained the information.    Ampal-American Israel (AMPL)  Corp., which holds a 12.5 percent
stake in Egyptian gas exporter East Mediterranean Gas Co., said
yesterday that the flow, halted on February 5 after an explosion
damaged a Sinai pipeline facility, would resume today. A
spokesman for Ampal was not immediately available for comment.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
