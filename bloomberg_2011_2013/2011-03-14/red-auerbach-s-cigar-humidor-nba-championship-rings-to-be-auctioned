Red Auerbach’s championship rings
and a team-signed cigar humidor are among the personal
memorabilia of the late Boston Celtics Hall of Fame coach to be
auctioned online.  Auerbach’s National Basketball Association title rings from
1957, 1962, 1974, 1976 and 1981  will be auctioned  by SCP
Auctions from April 15 to 30, the auction house said in a news
release.  Known for often having a cigar in his mouth and lighting
one up on the bench when victory was assured, Auerbach’s
presentational humidor from the 1954-55 season, engraved with
team signatures, is also up for auction, as is a 1950 Bob Cousy
game-worn rookie jersey that belonged to Auerbach.  Auerbach, who died on Oct. 28, 2006, at age 89, coached the
Celtics to nine NBA championships, in 1957 and from 1959 to
1966. He later became the team’s president and general manager.
The first coach to win 1,000 games, Auerbach was inducted into
the  Basketball Hall of Fame  in 1969.  To contact the reporter on this story:
