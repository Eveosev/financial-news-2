Former Chief Executive Officer of  El Al Israel Airlines (ELAL)  Ltd. Haim Romano will pay back $350,000 in
extra bonus received by the company, Calcalist reported, without
saying where it obtained the information. The airline on March
10 agreed to pay a 1.5 million-shekel fine to
the Israel Securities Authority levied over the manner in which
the terms of his employment were approved.  A spokeswoman for El Al declined to comment on the report.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
