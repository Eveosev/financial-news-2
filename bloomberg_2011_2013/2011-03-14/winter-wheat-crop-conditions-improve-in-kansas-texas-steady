Winter-wheat conditions in  Kansas 
improved last week after most of the state received some
precipitation, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said.
Conditions in Texas were unchanged.  About 26 percent of the crop in  Kansas , the biggest U.S.
winter-wheat grower, was in good or excellent condition as of
yesterday, up from 25 percent a  week earlier , the USDAâ€™s
National Agricultural Statistics Service said today in a report
on its website. About 18 percent of  Texas  crops were rated good
to excellent, unchanged from a week  earlier .  To contact the reporter on this story:
