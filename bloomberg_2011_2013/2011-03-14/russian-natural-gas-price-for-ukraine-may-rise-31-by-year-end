Ukraine may pay Russia $347 per
thousand cubic meters of natural gas in the fourth quarter
because of higher oil prices, said Energy and Coal Industry
Minister Yuriy Boyko.  That is 31 percent higher than the $264 that Ukraine is
paying this quarter. The price will rise to $293 in the second
quarter and $313 in the third quarter, Boyko said late yesterday
in an interview with Ukrainian  private  TV Channel 5. The gas
price is linked to oil and product prices.  To contact the reporters on this story:
