Russia’s food safety service,
 Rosselkhoznadzor , said it may temporarily restrict deliveries of
fish and fish products from U.S. companies that failed to supply
required documentation.  The measures may be applied after agency officials found
that 2,000 kilograms (4,409 pounds) of frozen salmon roe shipped
from the U.S. to the Russian port of Kaliningrad weren’t
accompanied by such documents, the service said on its website
today. It didn’t specify which U.S. companies may be affected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
