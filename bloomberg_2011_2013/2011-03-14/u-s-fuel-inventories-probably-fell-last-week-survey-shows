U.S. inventories of gasoline and
heating oil probably declined last week as refiners operated at
reduced rates, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Gasoline inventories dropped 2 million barrels in the seven
days ended March 11 from 229.2 million a week earlier, according
to the median of seven analyst estimates before an Energy
Department report on March 16. Six of the respondents projected
a decrease and one said there was an increase.  Stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, slipped 1.5 million barrels from 155.2
million the previous week. All seven respondents forecast a
decline.  “Refinery utilization rates are low because the margins of
producing products are still relatively low,” said Carl Larry,
president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston.  Refineries probably operated at 82 percent of capacity last
week, unchanged from the previous week, according to the median
of analyst responses. During the week ended Feb. 18, refineries
operated at 79.4 percent of capacity, the lowest rate in a year.
Plants ran at 88 percent in the week ended Dec. 31.  Stockpiles of crude oil probably rose 1.75 million barrels
from 348.9 million the prior week, according to the survey. Six
of the analysts anticipated a gain and one projected a drop.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its weekly
report at 10:30 a.m. on March 16 in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
