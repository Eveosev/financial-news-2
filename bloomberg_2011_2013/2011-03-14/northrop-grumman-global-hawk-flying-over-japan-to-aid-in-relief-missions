A  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC)  Global
Hawk drone, based in  Guam , is flying over Japan collecting data
and imagery for Japanese government relief efforts, according to
a U.S. military spokesman.  The drone, best known for missions over Iraq and
Afghanistan, “is being used exclusively in relief efforts at
the request of the Japanese government,” said the U.S. Forces-
Japan spokesman, Air Force Major Joseph Macri, in an e-mail
statement. It was also used over  Haiti  last year for broad-area
surveillance.  The 9.0-magnitude temblor and subsequent tsunami on March
11 has led to what Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  called the country’s
worst crisis since War II.  The long-range drone, which  arrived in Guam  in September,
“is flying aerial surveillance missions in support of
earthquake and tsunami relief operations in  Japan ,” Macri said.
It’s part of a U.S. military support effort that may include 13
Navy vessels and hundreds of U.S. personnel.  The Global Hawk’s imagery may help Japan assess damage as
well as logistical information such as functional ports or
landing sites that could be used for relief, he said.  “It’s flying almost continuously” and “will continue at
the request of the Japanese government,” Macri said.  The aircraft can fly as high as 60,000 feet and is equipped
with sensors and cameras that can take infrared and electro-
optical images as well as detailed synthetic aperture radar-
based pictures. It is designed to flights as long as 35 hours,
according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
