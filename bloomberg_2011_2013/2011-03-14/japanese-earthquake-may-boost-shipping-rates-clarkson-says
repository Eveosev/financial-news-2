  Japan ’s strongest earthquake on
record may be “positive” for short-term shipping rates as
laden vessels unable to berth are taken off the market,  Clarkson
Plc (CKN) , the world’s largest shipbroker, said.  Three Japanese oil ports and one terminal remained closed
after being damaged during the 8.9-magnitude earthquake and
tsunami on March 11, Inchcape Shipping Services said. Sendai,
Onahama and Kashima are closed while the Cosmo terminal at the
port of Chiba is also still shut, Inchcape said in an e-mailed
report today.  “Immediately you have major disruption to the logistics
system,” Martin Stopford, London-based managing director of
Clarkson Research Studies, said in a phone interview today. A
ship stuck with a cargo will be one fewer available for the  spot
market , he said.  The ports of Akita, Niigata, Chiba (excluding the Cosmo
facility), Kawasaki, Yokohama, Nagoya, Yokkaichi, Atsumi, Owase,
Shimotsu, Sakai, Sakaide, Mizushima, Iwakuni, Tokuyama,
Kanokawa, Kikuma, Namikata, Oita and Saganoseki are open,
Inchcape said.  Inchcape has offices in  Tokyo , Yokahama, Osaka, Kobe and
Imabari, according to its website. It is a global port agent,
organizing shipping arrivals and departures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
