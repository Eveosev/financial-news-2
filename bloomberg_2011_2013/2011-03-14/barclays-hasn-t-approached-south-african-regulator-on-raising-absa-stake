  Barclays Plc (BARC)  hasn’t approached
South Africa’s banking regulator about increasing its stake in  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) , Errol Kruger, the registrar of banks, said.  “Prior discussion and consultation with the office of the
Registrar of Banks would most certainly be required,” Kruger
said in an e-mailed response to questions today, declining
further comment on the matter. Barclays is considering raising
its stake in Absa, Johannesburg-based Business Day newspaper
reported today, citing an interview with Barclays Chairman
Marcus Agius.  Barclays was in 2005 given approval to buy more than 49
percent and less than 74 percent of the shareholding of Absa by
South Africa’s Department of Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
