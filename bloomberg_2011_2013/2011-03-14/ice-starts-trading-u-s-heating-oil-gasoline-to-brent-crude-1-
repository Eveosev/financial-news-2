ICE Futures Europe exchange, a unit
of  Intercontinental Exchange  Inc., began trading today on the
spread between U.S. oil-products and North Sea Brent crude.  The new contracts are “in response to requests from U.S.-
based market participants who require a tradable crack
relationship to the global Brent crude benchmark,” Atlanta-
based Intercontinental Exchange said today by e-mail.  The exchange will offer a contract on U.S. heating oil
versus Brent futures and a contract for U.S. gasoline against
the same crude, it said. “Brent is the most widely used
contract for pricing global crude, including grades in Africa,
the Middle East and  Asia ,” according to the statement.  The price difference between Brent traded in  London  and
West Texas Intermediate traded in  New York  widened to $13.27 a
barrel from $12.68 on March 11. Brent exceeded WTI by a record
$19.54 on Feb. 21 as supplies advanced in the U.S. and unrest
spread in the Middle East and North Africa.  “The two new Brent-based cracks make it possible to
effectively align U.S.-refined product pricing with the
benchmark that best represents the global price of crude oil for
refiners, traders and hedgers,” according to today’s statement.  Brent has been trading at a premium to WTI since August
2010 after inventories in Cushing, Oklahoma, the main U.S. hub
rose to records. Unlike WTI, Brent can be shipped to overseas
markets making its price more sensitive to political unrest and
export disruptions in North  Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
