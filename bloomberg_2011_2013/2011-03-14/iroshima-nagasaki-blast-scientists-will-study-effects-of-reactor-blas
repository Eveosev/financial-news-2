The Japanese research center that’s
studied atomic bomb survivors for 35 years will send scientists
to monitor the health effects of an explosion at a nuclear
reactor in Fukushima.  An initial team comprising two medical researchers from the
 Radiation Effects Research Foundation  may leave as early as this
week, Evan Douple, the foundation’s associate chief of research,
said in a telephone interview today. Additional researchers may
follow, he said. The team will measure radiation and collaborate
with health officials to better understand the ramifications of
any  radiation exposure  on human health.  The radioactivity measured at a building housing Tokyo
Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi No. 3 reactor, where an
explosion occurred earlier today, was less than 2 percent of the
level known to be detrimental to people, Hidehiko Nishiyama,
deputy director-general of Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety
Agency, said in Tokyo.  The Radiation Effects Research Foundation in  Hiroshima  was
established in 1975 to study the medical effects of radiation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
