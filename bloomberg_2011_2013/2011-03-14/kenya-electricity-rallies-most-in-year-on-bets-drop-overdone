Kenya Electricity Generating Co.,
the nation’s biggest power producer, rose the most in a year on
speculation a 14 percent drop last week was overdone.  The stock increased 7.6 percent to 14.25 shillings by the 3
p.m. close in Nairobi.  The company’s 14-day relative strength index fell to 14.57
on March 11, below the 30 threshold that some traders see as a
sign an asset’s price has fallen too far and is poised to rise.  “People have started coming back to the market to pick
bargains,” Renaldo D’souza, an analyst at Nairobi-based Genghis
Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
