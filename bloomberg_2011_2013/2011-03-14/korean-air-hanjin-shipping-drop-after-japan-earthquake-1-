  Korean Air  Lines Co., the country’s
biggest carrier, led declines among the nation’s airlines and
shipping lines on concern an earthquake in  Japan  will damp
travel and trade between the two countries.  Korean Air dropped as much as 7.2 percent to 57,000 won,
the biggest intraday drop since Feb. 22, and traded at 57,800
won as of 10:48 a.m. in Seoul. Hanjin Shipping Co., South
Korea’s largest shipping line, fell as much as 5.8 percent to
35,200 won.  An 8.9-magnitude earthquake struck Japan on March 11,
followed by a tsunami, which together destroyed buildings and
may have killed as many 10,000 people in Miyagi prefecture,
north of  Tokyo , alone. The cost of rebuilding may sap demand for
travel to  South Korea , which received 3.02 million Japanese
visitors last year, or 34 percent of foreign arrivals, according
to the  Korea Culture and Tourism Institute .  “There could be some immediate impact on tourism and trade
from the quake,” said Yun Hee Do, an analyst at Korea
Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “But eventually, it could
spur travel as more tourists may choose to visit Korea instead
of Japan.”    Asiana Airlines (020560)  Inc., South Korea’s No. 2 carrier, dropped
as much as 8.3 percent to 9,130 won. Hyundai Merchant Marine
Co., the country’s second-largest shipping line, fell as much as
6 percent to 27,250 won.  Exports to Japan made up 15 percent of South Korea’s total
shipments in 2010.  Flights between South Korea and Japan accounted for 16
percent of Korean Air’s passenger sales in the fourth quarter,
according to company data. Less than 1 percent of Hanjin
Shipping’s total volume comes from trade between the two Asian
countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
