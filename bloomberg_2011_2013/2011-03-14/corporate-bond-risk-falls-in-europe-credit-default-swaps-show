The cost of insuring against
European corporate bonds fell, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 8 basis
points to 389, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 8 a.m. in  London . The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and a decline signals improvement in
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 2.5 basis points to 101, JPMorgan
prices show. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks and
insurers decreased 1.5 to 164 and the subordinated index was
unchanged at 284.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.9 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
