Mauritius’s current account deficit
widened to 8.5 percent of gross domestic product last year on a
larger trade gap, the Bank of Mauritius said.  The deficit increased from 7.4 percent in 2009, the Port
Louis-based central bank said in a  statement  on its website
today. The gap jumped to 8.5 percent in the fourth quarter of
2010 compared with 6.9 percent a year earlier, it said.  It is “mainly as a result of a marked increase in the
merchandise trade deficit coupled with lower surplus on current
transfers,” the central bank said.  The Indian Ocean island nation’s trade deficit widened to
59 billion rupees ($2 billion) in 2010 from 49.5 billion a year
earlier, it said. Net inflows into the capital and financial
account climbed 67 percent to 19.9 billion rupees, the bank
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
