Israeli Foreign Minister  Avigdor
Lieberman  said that the Islamic militant Hamas group that
controls the Gaza Strip will try to take over the West Bank, the
daily Haaretz reported today.  Lieberman, who said Hamas is now stronger than the
Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas ’s Fatah faction,
made the comments to parliament’s foreign affairs and defense
committee, the paper said.   Hamas is waiting for Abbas to achieve political goals in
the international arena before it makes it move, Haaretz cited
Lieberman as saying. The paper did not say where it got the
information.   To contact the reporter on this story:
