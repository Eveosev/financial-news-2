Coal prices, up 8.1 percent this
month, will be supported by flooding in Australia and an
earthquake in  Japan , Societe Generale SA said.  Japan, which depends on imports for most of its fuel needs,
suffered an earthquake and tsunami this month, knocking out
nuclear-powered generators. Flooding inundated coal mines in
northeast Australia this year, forcing producers to declare
force majeure, a legal clause allowing companies to miss
contract terms because of circumstances beyond their control.  “An already nervous market has undoubtedly grown tighter
as a result of these supply and demand shocks,” Paris-based
Societe Generale analyst  Emmanuel Fages  wrote. “As a result,
there is little chance of coal prices moving back down even
below $110 a ton.”  Coal delivered to northwest  Europe  rose to $129.11 a metric
ton in the week to March 18, according to data from researcher
IHS McCloskey. Societe Generale forecast Rotterdam prices of
$118 for the second quarter and $123 for the following three
months.  Rio Tinto Group ended a declaration of force majeure at its
Claremont mine in  Australia  on March 9 after more than two
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
