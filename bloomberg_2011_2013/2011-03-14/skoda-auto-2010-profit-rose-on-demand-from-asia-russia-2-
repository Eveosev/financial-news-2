Skoda Auto AS, the Czech unit of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , said its full-year after-tax profit more than
tripled, boosted by demand in  Russia ,  India  and  China .  Profit after tax for 2010 was 349 million euros ($487
million) from 110 million euros a year ago, the  Czech Republic ,
Mlada Boleslav-based company said. Revenue grew 22.4 percent to
8.69 billion euros. The company delivered 762,600 vehicles in
2010, up 11.5 percent from the previous year.  The debut of the “City Car” will be the most important
development for the company this year, Chief Executive Officer
Winfried Vahland told reporters at a press conference in Prague
today. Skoda expects the model will “significantly” contribute
to its 2018 sales targets, Vahland said.  Volkswagen is seeking to reposition Skoda under Vahland and
reinforce the carmaker’s traditional focus on Eastern  Europe  and  Asia . Europe’s largest carmaker wants to pass Toyota Motor Corp.
as the world’s biggest automaker and is looking to units such as
Skoda to broaden sales in emerging markets in Asia.  ‘Moderate’ Growth  Skoda Auto, which was acquired by Volkswagen in 1991, sees
“moderate” growth rates in European markets while demand in
Russia and Asian countries such as China and India will help
boost growth, it said. The company aims to deliver 1.5 million
units annually by 2018.  The car-maker aims to increase production at all locations,
as it seeks to “internationalize” the company with plants in
the Czech Republic, and in Russia, India, China that it uses
together with Volkswagen, the executive said.  Skoda Auto is still studying the potential effect of the
Japanese earthquake and tsunami on its Chinese assembly plants,
officials said. About 90 percent of the parts for Chinese-made
cars are produced locally, they said.  While making a firm forecast is difficult due to questions
about the price of oil and the outlook for the European
economies, Skoda Auto should produce better earnings than in
2010 and remains “positive” about the global automobile
market, Vahland said.  Skoda reported full-year net profit of 8.8 billion koruna
($505 million) from 3.5 billion koruna a year ago, it said in
its annual report handed out at the press conference today.  The company will distribute about 50 percent of its after-
tax earnings for a dividend of about 195 million euros, Skoda
Auto’s chief financial officer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
