  Palm oil  tumbled to the lowest
level in more than three months on concern that  Japan ’s worst
earthquake on record may slow global economic recovery, cooling
demand for commodities.  The May-delivery contract plunged as much as 2.5 percent to
3,281 ringgit ($1,079) a metric ton before closing at 3,335
ringgit, the lowest price since Nov. 26. Futures shed 8.1
percent last week, the most since the period ended Dec. 5, 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  “Commodity prices are lower across the board on concern
that shipments to Japan could be affected, softening demand in
the near term,” said Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB Investment Bank
Bhd. “Japan’s economic recovery may temporarily stall, which
could affect other Asian counterparts.”  Asian shares slumped, with the Nikkei 225 Stock Average
tumbling the most in two years, after the March 11 quake sent
crude oil lower and spurred a jump in gold and default risk. The  Bank of Japan  today injected 7 trillion yen ($86 billion) into
the financial system.  Japan’s Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister  Kaoru Yosano 
said the impact of the earthquake and tsunami will hit the
economy in its core. The official toll reached 1,597, with 1,481
more missing and 1,683 injured, the  National Police Agency  said.
More than 350,000 people are in emergency shelters.  Improved Supply  Prospects for higher output and inventory in Malaysia, the
second-largest producer, also pressured palm oil prices.  Production in February climbed 3.5 percent to 1,094,473
tons, the first gain after three months of declines. Stockpiles
rose 4.2 percent to 1,478,793 tons, the country’s palm oil board
said March 10. Output in January fell to a four-year low, data
from the board show.  World soybean reserves before the next Northern Hemisphere
harvests will be larger than forecast in February because of
higher output from Brazil, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said March 10. Palm and soybean oils are substitutes for food
and fuel uses.  Soybean oil for May delivery shed 1 percent to 55.34 cents
a pound in  Chicago  at 7:06 p.m. in  Singapore . Soybeans for
delivery in the same month fell 1 percent to $13.2175 a bushel.  September-delivery palm oil on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  fell 2 percent to close at 8,988 yuan ($1,368). Soybean
oil for delivery in the same month shed 1.3 percent to close at
9,880 yuan. CME Group Inc.’s most-active June palm-oil contract,
pegged to the Malaysian benchmark price, dropped 2.9 percent to
$1,087.25 at 4:51 p.m. Singapore time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
