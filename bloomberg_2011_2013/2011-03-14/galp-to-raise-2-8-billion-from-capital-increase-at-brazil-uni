  Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) ,  Portugal ’s
biggest oil company, aims to raise about 2 billion euros ($2.8
billion) from a capital increase at its Brazilian unit as it
develops offshore projects in the Latin American nation.  The company plans to complete the share sale in the second
half of the year, Lisbon-based Galp said today in a regulatory
filing. Galp plans to invest 1.2 billion euros to 1.5 billion
euros this year in Portugal and elsewhere. It will invest about
3.5 billion euros in the 2012-2015 period, with exploration and
production representing 70 percent of the total.  Galp is expanding exploration in regions such as Brazil’s
offshore  Santos Basin , where the Lula project is located, and  Angola  to improve access to crude supplies and rely less on
refining and sales of fuel in Portugal and  Spain . Its refining
business recovered last year after the global recession curbed
demand for oil products.  The oil company’s stock rose 0.9 percent to 15.39 euros at
1:30 p.m. in Lisbon. The shares have gained 7.3 percent this
year, giving Galp a market value of 12.8 billion euros.  No-one was immediately available at Galp’s press office to
comment on how the Brazilian unit’s capital increase will be
arranged.  Earnings Growth  Galp forecasts average annual growth in earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about 15
percent from 2010 to 2015 as it develops the Lula and Cernambi
fields offshore  Brazil  and completes upgrade projects at its two
refineries to increase diesel output and improve margins. The
company previously had a forecast for Ebitda to climb 15 percent
to 20 percent a year from 2009 to 2014.  The Oporto refinery will start full production in the
second quarter after the conversion project is completed, while
Sines will start by the end of the year, the company said in a
presentation on Feb. 11. The refinery in Oporto can process
about 90,000 barrels a day, while the Sines plant has a 220,000-
barrel-a-day capacity.  Galp today said it targets a 10-fold increase in working
interest production to 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day
in 2020 from 19,500 barrels in 2010. It aims to reach working
interest production of 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day
before 2025.  In Brazil, the company has stakes in four offshore blocks
in the Santos Basin, including the Lula and Jupiter finds. The
Lula field, formerly known as Tupi, holds an estimated 6.5
billion barrels of recoverable oil and equivalents. Galp is also
a partner of  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  at Cernambi, which holds 1.8
billion barrels of estimated reserves.  Petrobras, Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, is
developing offshore deposits that include the Americas’ two
largest oil discoveries since  Mexico ’s Cantarell field in 1976.  Investment    China  Petrochemical Corp., China’s second-largest oil and
gas producer, last year agreed to invest $7.1 billion in the
Brazilian unit of  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  as that Spanish company raises
funds for its offshore projects. Sinopec Group, as the Chinese
company is known, holds 40 percent of Repsol’s Brazilian unit.  Galp in February said proved and probable reserves, on a
net entitlement basis, were 397 million barrels of oil and
natural gas at the end of last year, compared with 35 million
barrels at the end of 2009, after adding Brazilian fields. In
Angola, the volume of reserves fell to 20 million barrels from
35 million barrels. Galp’s contingent resources fell to 2.356
billion barrels from 3.065 billion barrels at the end of 2009.    Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Italy ’s biggest oil company, and Portuguese
holding company Amorim Energia BV each control a third of Galp.
Petrobras on Feb. 7 said it ended talks with Eni about the
purchase of a stake in Galp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
