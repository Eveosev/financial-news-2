Denmark’s ruling Liberal-
Conservative bloc is catching up in the polls with the Social-
Democrat led opposition, a Gallup Denmark survey for Berlinsgke
Tidende showed.  The Liberal-Conservative minority coalition, which rules
with the backing of the Danish  People’s Party , would win 48.9
percent of votes if an election were held today, the Gallup poll
conducted March 11 showed, Berlingske reported today. The
opposition bloc would get 50.8 percent backing, Berlingske said,
citing the Gallup poll. That compares with 47.8 percent backing
for the government and 52.2 percent to the opposition in a Jan.
14 poll, Berlingske said. The newspaper didn’t give a margin of
error.   Denmark is due to hold parliamentary elections by November.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
