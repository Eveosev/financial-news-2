More than 5,000 people joined a
march called by a Turkish free press advocacy group to protest
against the arrests and harassment of journalists,  Radikal 
newspaper reported.  Some 1,000 reporters formed the core of the march down
Istiklal Street, central Istanbul’s main pedestrian
thoroughfare, Radikal said. The protesters called for the
release of imprisoned journalists and for greater freedom of the
press, Radikal said.  Four journalists were sent to prison on March 6 in an
expanding probe into the alleged “Ergenekon” coup plot against
the government of Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan .  Turkey  is
ranked 138th out of 178 countries in the Reporters Without
Borders press freedom index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
