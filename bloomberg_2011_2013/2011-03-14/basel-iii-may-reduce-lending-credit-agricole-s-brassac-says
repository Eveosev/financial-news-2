Additional  capital requirements  as
part of the so-called Basel III rules may prompt banks to
reduce lending to companies because corporate credit can no
longer be used to calculate short-term liquidity ratios, Les
Echos reported, citing an interview with  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) 
Deputy Chairman Philippe Brassac.  The solvability rules agreed upon by the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision would require greater equity, raising
the cost of credit,  Brassac  said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
