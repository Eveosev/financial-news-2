The yen fell versus the dollar and
the euro, reversing earlier gains, before a  Bank of Japan (8301) 
meeting today amid speculation policy makers may decide to sell
the currency to weaken it.  The yen dropped to as weak as 82.15 per dollar before
trading at 82.07 as of 9:55 a.m. in Tokyo, from 81.84 on March
11 in  New York . Earlier today the yen climbed to 80.62, the
strongest since Nov. 9. Japanâ€™s currency declined to 114.14
against the euro from 113.76.  To contact the reporter on this story:
