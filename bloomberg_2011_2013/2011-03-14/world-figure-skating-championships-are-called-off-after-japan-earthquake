The  International Skating Union 
called off the world figure skating championships in  Tokyo 
scheduled for next week as  Japan  deals with the earthquake and
tsunami that hit the country.  The ISU said it took the decision on safety concerns after
consultation with the Japan Skating Federation and in light of
advice from national authorities. The event may be rescheduled,
the group said.  “The postponement of the event or alternatively the final
cancellation is under evaluation,” the ISU said  on its website .  Japan’s Daisuke Takahashi is the men’s defending world
champion, while his compatriot Mao Asada is the title holder in
the women’s event.  The world championships had been scheduled for March 21-27
at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium in Tokyo, 135 miles (217
kilometers) from the stricken Fukushima Dai-ichi atomic complex.  Workers battled to prevent a nuclear meltdown after a
second hydrogen explosion rocked the plant, while officials said
the death toll from the nation’s strongest earthquake may top
10,000.  “The situation at the Fukushima nuclear plant continues to
be a concern,” Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said at a
meeting of the government’s crisis response team in Tokyo.  The 8.9-magnitude temblor and subsequent tsunami has left
thousands stranded without food, water or heat in Sendai, 193
miles north of Tokyo, and the government has warned there may be
rolling power outages in the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
