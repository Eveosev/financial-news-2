Kazuaki Oh’e, a debt salesman at
CIBC World Markets  Japan  Inc. in  Tokyo , comments on  government
bonds  and the  Bank of Japan ’s plan to add a record amount of
funds into the banking system.  “They’re indicating they will support  cash flow  100
percent. We need money at the banks. They shouldn’t be lacking
cash.”  Trading is taking place as usual, he said. “It’s not too
busy, not a panic. We are trading calmly.”  The Bank of Japan pumped 15 trillion yen ($183 billion) of
money into the financial system and doubled the size of its
asset-purchase program to shield the economy from the effects of
the nation’s strongest earthquake on record.  -- Editors: Nicholas Reynolds  To contact the reporter on this story:
