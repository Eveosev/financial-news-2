U.S. nuclear-power output fell 2.5
percent to its lowest level in almost four months as  Exelon
Corp. (EXC) , American Electric Power Co. and the Nebraska Public Power
District shut reactors, the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  said.  Production nationwide decreased by 2,215 megawatts since
March 11 to 85,699 megawatts, or 84 percent of capacity, the
smallest amount since Nov. 18, according to a report today from
the NRC and data compiled by Bloomberg. Sixteen of the nationâ€™s
104 reactors were offline.  Exelon shut the 1,164-megawatt  Byron 1 reactor  for more
than $3 million in refueling and maintenance, Paul Dempsey, a
plant spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. The plant is 85
miles (137 kilometers) west of Chicago. The 1,136-megawatt Byron
2 is operating at full capacity.  American Electric closed its 1,009-megawatt Donald C. Cook
1 reactor on the eastern shore of  Lake Michigan , 26 miles
northwest of South Bend, Indiana. The 1,060-megawatt Cook 2 is
at full power.  The Nebraska Public Power District shut its 830-megawatt
Cooper reactor near Brownville, on the Missouri River 64 miles
south of Omaha.    NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  started the 693-megawatt Turkey Point 3
reactor in Florida. It is operating at 2 percent of capacity.
Another 693-megawatt reactor at the site, Turkey Point 4, is
operating at full power. The plant is 20 miles south of Miami.    PPL Corp. (PPL)  boosted its 1,149-megawatt Susquehanna 1 reactor
in Pennsylvania, 50 miles northwest of Allentown, to 99 percent
of capacity from 17 percent on March 11. The 1,140-megawatt
Susquehanna 2 unit was operating at 94 percent of capacity.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
