  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  Vice
Chairman Charles Munger is donating $20 million to the
University of Michigan’s law school to renovate a housing
complex.  The gift will help upgrade student rooms and living areas,
the university in  Ann Arbor  said in a statement today.  Munger, who studied math at Michigan as an undergraduate,
has lectured at the university and acted as its investment
adviser, according to the statement. The 87-year-old billionaire
also donated $3 million in 2007 for lighting in public areas of
the Law Quadrangle, where the housing will be renovated.  “Charlie Munger has a powerful vision of world-class
facilities that will match a world-class law school at the
University of Michigan,” Mary Sue Coleman, president of the
university, said in the statement. “I am particularly pleased
because this gift directly benefits the living-learning
experience for our law students.”  Munger, a 1948 graduate of  Harvard Law School , founded the
Los Angeles law firm of Munger, Tolles & Olson. He became vice
chairman of Warren Buffett’s Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway in
1978, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Janet Lorin  in New York   jlorin@bloomberg.net .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
