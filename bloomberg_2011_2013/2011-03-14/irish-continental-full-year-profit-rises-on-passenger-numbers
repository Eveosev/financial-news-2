  Irish Continental Group Plc (IR5A)  full-
year profit climbed 55 percent as an increase in passengers
offset “weakness” in freight operations.  Net income rose to 39 million euros ($54.4 million) in the
year ended Dec. 31 from 25.2 million euros a year earlier, as
sales rose for the first time in three years, the Dublin-based
company said in a statement today. Operating profit rose 54
percent to 40.9 million euros. Sales increased 0.7 percent to
262.2 million euros.  Revenue from passengers rose 12 percent last year as
Ireland became better value for tourists and new attractions
such as a convention center and football stadium in Dublin
helped draw visitors, the company said. Freight revenue dropped
5.2 percent as Ireland experienced “one of the most difficult
periods” in is economic history and overcapacity in the
shipping market weighed on traffic.  “We are facing into an uncertain year with the combined
effects of higher fuel costs and austerity programs in Ireland
and the U.K. providing a challenge,” Chairman John B McGuckian
in today’s statement. “We have made a solid start to the year
and with a strong balance sheet to support us we look forward to
the rest of the year with confidence.”  For this year to March 5 Irish Ferries’ passenger numbers
are up 4 percent, while the number of containers carried is up 1
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
