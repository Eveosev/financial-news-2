Praktiker AG lost its position as  Germany ’s second-biggest home-improvement retailer last year as
closely held competitor Bauhaus GmbH generated higher revenue,
industry publisher  Daehne Verlag  said.  Praktiker’s gross sales dropped 6.6 percent to 4.07 billion
euros ($5.68 billion) in 2010, according to the Daehne Statistik
DIY yearbook for Germany. That compares with a 7 percent sales
gain to 4.44 billion euros at Bauhaus, according to the
publication.  Full-year net sales at Praktiker, excluding value-added
tax, fell 5.9 percent to 3.45 billion euros as the company
offered fewer discount days in its home market, the Kirkel-based
retailer said on Jan. 6. Revenue also declined in Romania and  Greece , where local governments cut back spending to reduce
budget deficits.  Praktiker had 438 outlets in 10 countries last year.
Mannheim-based Bauhaus has more than 215 stores in 16 countries,
the company’s  website  says. Germany’s largest do-it-yourself
chain is the Obi brand of Tengelmann Group, which according to
Daehne had 6.2 billion euros in gross sales last year.  Harald Guenter, a spokesman at Praktiker, confirmed the
company’s gross sales figures and new ranking. Bauhaus declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
