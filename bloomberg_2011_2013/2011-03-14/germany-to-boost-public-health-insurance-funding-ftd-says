The German government plans to help
pay public health-insurance surcharges to assist people with
lower incomes who have difficulty affording their premiums,
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing unidentified
government officials.  Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  reserved 700 million
euros ($975 million) in budget plans for 2015 to help fund
additional insurance premiums that people with lower incomes
can’t afford, the newspaper said. Net new borrowing won’t be
affected, according to FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
