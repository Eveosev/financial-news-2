Romanian President Traian Basescu
said he wants to amend the constitution to limit the  budget
deficit  at the European Union’s ceiling of 3 percent of economic
output before the Balkan nation holds an election next year.    Romania  is facing political irresponsibility: before a
general election, politicians are raising wages and pensions,
exceeding limits and then the future government will have to
borrow more to pay off its debts to fulfil electoral promises,”
he said on state television yesterday. “The budget-deficit cap
would discipline the political class.”  Romania, the 27-member EU’s  second-poorest country after   Bulgaria , is struggling to recover from its worst recession on
record. The government increased investment spending in the
first half of the year to boost the economy after imposing
austerity measures to qualify for payments from a bailout.  The country is seeking a new precautionary loan agreement
to safeguard against potential effects from  Europe ’s sovereign-
debt crisis while pledging to narrow the budget deficit to 4.4
percent of gross domestic product this year and 3 percent in
2012.  A parliamentary committee will work over the summer in
Bucharest on a draft of the constitutional changes, Basescu
said. No date for parliamentary elections in 2012 has been set.  “The estimate is for the new Constitution to take effect
once the current lawmakers finish their mandate,” he said in
the television interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
