Ethanol futures rebounded from the
lowest price in three weeks on speculation that  Japan  will
increase purchases as it recovers from last week’s earthquake.  The grain-based gasoline additive followed corn higher
after Standard Chartered Plc said Japan, the largest importer of
U.S. corn, may increase grain purchases to guarantee food
supplies. One bushel of corn distills into about 2.75 gallons of
ethanol in the U.S.  “It’s uncertainty over Japan,” said Terry Reilly, an
analyst at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in  Chicago . “The corn
price definitely has the upper hand on the price impact for
ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery increased 1.3 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $2.462 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices hit $2.449 a gallon on March 11, the lowest level
since Feb. 22. Futures are up 3.5 percent this year and are up
60 percent in the past year.  Corn futures for May delivery advanced 1.75 cents, or 0.3
percent, to close at $6.66 a bushel. The grain is the primary
ingredient used to distill ethanol in the U.S.  An average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is losing 2 cents on every
gallon produced, while a plant in  Illinois  is pocketing about 5
cents, according to Ag Trader Talk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
