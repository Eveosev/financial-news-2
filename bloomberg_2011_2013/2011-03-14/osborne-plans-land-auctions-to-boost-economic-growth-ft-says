U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  is about to invite a small number of local
authorities to take part in pilot “land auctions,” in an
attempt to force down the price of development land, the
Financial Times reported.  The aim is to induce councils to give more planning
approvals for homes, business parks and other projects, thus
stimulating economic growth, the newspaper said.  Under the system, councils would ask local landowners to
submit sealed-bid letters stating prices at which they would be
willing to sell their land; those prices would be binding and
councils would have the right to buy the land for a set period,
the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
