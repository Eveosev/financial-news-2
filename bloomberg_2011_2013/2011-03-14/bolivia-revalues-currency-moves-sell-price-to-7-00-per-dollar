  Bolivia  revalued the exchange rate
of the boliviano to a sell price of 7.00 per dollar from 7.02.
The change to the boliviano’s crawling peg went into effect
Saturday, according to information released by the Andean
nation’s central bank Friday.  The central bank has strengthened the boliviano six times
since Nov. 23, when the sell price was 7.07 per dollar, as
Bolivia looks to control inflation that reached 10 percent in
February compared with the same month a year earlier.
