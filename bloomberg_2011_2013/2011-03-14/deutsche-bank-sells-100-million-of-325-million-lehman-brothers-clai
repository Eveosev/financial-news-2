  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  sold $100 million
in claims on bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. to Dolostone
LLC of New York, according to a bankruptcy court filing.  The two claims on Lehman and its commercial paper unit were
part of an original $325 million claim, according to the filing
today in Manhattan.    Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  sold a $325 million claim on Lehman and its
commercial paper unit to Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank last
week, according to court records.  IOUs issued by Lehman, which unsuccessfully sued  Barclays
Plc (BARC)  for $11 billion to try to raise its payout to creditors,
trade frequently between banks and investors or speculators. The
face value of Lehman claims traded in the firm’s second year of
bankruptcy totaled $28.8 billion, four times the total for 2009,
according to data from SecondMarket Holdings Inc., which tracks
illiquid markets.  Dolostone, which listed a P.O. Box number in New York and
an e-mail address in court filings, didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mail seeking comment.  Renee Calabro, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, declined to 
comment.  Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC bought $20 million of
a $325 million Lehman claim from Deutche Bank last week,
according to filings.  The case is In re  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
