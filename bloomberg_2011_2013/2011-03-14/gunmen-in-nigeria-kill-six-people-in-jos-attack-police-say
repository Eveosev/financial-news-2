Gunmen in  Nigeria  carried out
simultaneous attacks today on two Christian villages killing six
people in the country’s Plateau state, a region beset in recent
months by sectarian violence, police said.  A police statement said five people from the same family
were killed in Kai village while another person was killed in
Gohog village.  “Efforts are on to apprehend the fleeing suspects and
investigations into the killings have commenced,” a police
statement said. The statement was signed by Jacob Apev, the
spokesman in Plateau State.  More than 200 people have died in reprisal attacks by
Christian and Muslim groups in the Plateau region, according to
New York-based  Human Rights Watch , since multiple bomb blasts in
Jos city on Christmas Eve killed 80 people. A radical Islamic
sect known as Boko Haram, or “Western education is a sin,”
claimed responsibility for the explosions.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous nation
with about 140 million people, is roughly split between a mainly
Muslim north and a predominantly Christian south. More than
14,000 people died in ethnic and religious clashes in the West
African nation between 1999 and 2009, according to the Brussels-
based  International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
