  Kenya ’s shilling snapped a seven-
day losing streak against the dollar after the nation’s central
bank last week said it supports a flexible exchange-rate policy.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy strengthened
0.6 percent to 84.9 per dollar at 11:03 a.m. in Nairobi from a
close of 85.38 on March 11, the weakest since 1994. The
shilling’s 14-day relative strength index fell to 21.25 on March
11, below the 30 threshold that some traders see as a sign an
asset’s price has fallen too far and is poised to rise.  Kenya’s central bank said the shilling will “rediscover its
path consistent with fundamentals” once the political crises in
North Africa and the Middle East are resolved. The country’s
“flexible exchange-rate policy is an automatic stabilizer meant
to absorb the external shocks hitting the economy,” Governor
Njuguna Ndung’u wrote in an e-mailed report dated March 9.  “The central bank’s decision not to intervene has calmed
the market’s nerves, allowing the shilling to snap the domino
effect experienced last week,” Dickson Magecha, a dealer at
Nairobi-based Standard Chartered Bank Kenya Ltd., said in a
phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
