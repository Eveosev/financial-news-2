Alpha Bank SA Chief Operating
Officer Spyros Filaretos said the bank wouldn’t consider any
merger offers from National Bank of Greece SA and that “as far
as we are concerned this deal is dead,” the Financial Times
reported, citing Filaretos.  The bank’s stance is supported by its “large, visible
foreign shareholders,” which include Qatar,  Blackrock Inc. (BLK)  and
Fidelity International Ltd., and who are “pretty appreciative
of the approach we’re taking,” Alpha Bank’s Chief Financial
Officer Vassilios Psaltis said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
