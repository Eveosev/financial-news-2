Laureate Education Inc., the
provider of campus- and Internet-based college education that
was bought for $3.82 billion, is seeking a seven-year, $1.295
billion  term loan  to refinance existing debt, according to a
person with knowledge of the deal.  The  company , which is based in Baltimore, is offering to
pay lenders 3.25 percentage points to 3.5 percentage points more
than the London interbank offered rate for the term loan, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private. Libor is the rate the banks charge to lend to each
other.  The term loan would have a Libor floor of 1.25 percent and
be sold at a discount of 99.5 cents on the dollar, the person
said.  It is also seeking a five-year, $300 million multicurrency
revolving line of credit, the person said.    Citigroup Inc. (C)  is arranging the loans, along with  Barclays
Capital , Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase & Co., the person said.  Lenders must let the banks know if they are participating
by March 21, the person said.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  Debra Epstein, a Laureate spokeswoman, declined to comment.  Laureate was bought in 2007 by an investor group led by
Douglas Becker, Laureate’s chairman and chief executive officer,
and also included KKR & Co., according to a June 4, 2007,  news
release .  To contact the reporter on this story:
