Kenya’s Ministry of Labor appointed
Deputy Labor Commissioner Elizabeth Onuk to resolve a dispute
between Kenya Power and Lighting Ltd., the nation’s monopoly
electricity distributor, and its unionized workers.  The parties are expected to meet tomorrow for talks, Joseph
Yida, an official at the ministry, said by phone from the
capital, Nairobi.  About 10,000 employees stopped work earlier today to
protest about issues ranging from the use of contractual
laborers to the company’s failure to renew a collective-
bargaining agreement, according to Ernest Nadome, secretary
general of the labor union.  The workers will “remain on strike until all these issues
are resolved,” he said by phone from Nairobi.  The strike isn’t expected to disrupt power supplies, Kenya
Power spokesman Migwi Theuri said. The company has contingency
plans in place to ensure normal service continues, he said,
without commenting further.  Last year, workers at Kenya Power called off industrial
action after the Ministry of Labor intervened in the dispute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
