Japan may declare force majeure to
prevent additional costs of buying emission permits as required
by the 1997  Kyoto Protocol  after an earthquake devastated the
country, according to an analyst at Orbeo.  The quake may add emissions of 74 million metric tons of
carbon dioxide equivalent as the country is forced to replace
power from nuclear reactors with fossil-fuel alternatives. That
would cost Japan an additional 370 million euros ($516 million)
assuming it has to pay 5 euros for every Assigned Amount Unit,
Emmanuel Fages, a Paris-based analyst at the emissions venture
of  Rhodia SA (RHA)  and  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, said today by e-mail.  Under the Kyoto treaty, developed nations agreed to limits
on emissions and received so-called AAUs up to that amount. The
extra costs for Japan would be “a significant drain on a budget
already strained,” Fages said.  By declaring force majeure, Japan would be saying that it
is no longer able to meet its Kyoto obligations due to events
beyond its control. The March 11 quake and tsunami, the biggest
to hit Japan, left 1.3 million people without power. It will
prompt  Asia ’s second-largest economy to scramble for alternative
fuel sources, driving up prices as it competes with other
importer nations for spot supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
