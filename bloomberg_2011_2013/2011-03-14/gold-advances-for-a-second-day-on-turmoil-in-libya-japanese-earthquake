Gold futures rose for the second
straight session as  Japan ’s strongest earthquake on record
boosted demand for a haven asset. Palladium fell for an eighth
straight session, the longest slump since July 2008.  Equities declined worldwide as officials said the death
toll from the earthquake and tsunami may top 10,000. Technicians
tried to contain damage from a second explosion at a nuclear
plant north of  Tokyo .  “Given the global political and financial uncertainty,
you’re seeing investors shifting assets away from dollars and
other currencies into hard assets,” said Stephen Platt, an
analyst at Archer Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago . “You’re
still going to see a lot of excess liquidity being pumped into
these markets that will encourage a flight to metals as a safe
haven.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose $3.10, or 0.2 percent,
to settle at $1,424.90 an ounce at 2:05 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The price climbed 0.7 percent on March 11. The metal has
gained 29 percent in the past year.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  poured a record 15 trillion yen ($183
billion) into the world’s third-biggest economy today as the
earthquake triggered a plunge in stocks and surge in credit
risk. The central bank also doubled the size of its asset-
purchase program to help shield the economy from the effects of
the quake.  Gold’s gains were limited after crude oil touched a two-
week low, easing demand for an inflation hedge. Gold reached a
record $1,445.70 on March 7 as oil topped $106 a barrel amid
escalating violence in the Middle East and northern  Africa .  Platinum Drops  Palladium and platinum, used mainly in pollution-control
devices in vehicles, fell on concern that industrial demand will
ease as damage from the quake hinders the global economy, said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter.  Companies including  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Honda Motor Co. and
Nissan Motor Co. shut some plants in Japan following the quake.  “Gold has risen sharply higher, while platinum and
palladium have fallen equally as sharply,” Gartman said.
“These moves imply a material weakening of the global
economy.”  Palladium futures for June delivery fell $17.30, or 2.3
percent, to close at $748.20 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price has dropped 9.1 percent since March 2.  Platinum futures for April delivery declined $29.40, or 1.7
percent, to $1,752.30 an ounce on the Nymex.  Silver futures for May delivery fell 9.5 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $35.84 an ounce on the Comex. The metal has more
than doubled in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
