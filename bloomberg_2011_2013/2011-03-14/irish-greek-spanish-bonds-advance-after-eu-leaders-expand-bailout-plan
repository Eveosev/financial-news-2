Irish, Greek and Spanish 10-year
bonds opened higher after European Union leaders agreed during
the weekend on a retooled bailout plan for the region’s most-
indebted nations.  The yield on Irish 10-year bonds fell six basis points to
9.59 percent as of 7:35 a.m. in  London , with the yield on
similar-maturity Greek debt down five basis points at 12.76
percent. Spanish 10-year yields dropped six basis points to 5.37
percent and equivalent-maturity Italian bond yields were seven
basis points lower at 4.80 percent.  Euro-area leaders struck an agreement on an expanded
bailout plan for the region’s most indebted nations during the
weekend, two weeks sooner than investors anticipated. Leaders
agreed to ease the terms of Greek rescue loans and will allow
the 440 billion-euro ($614 billion) bailout fund to be used to
its full extend to assist debt-strapped nations.  The yield on German bunds,  Europe ’s benchmark governement
debt securities, fell two basis points to 3.19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
