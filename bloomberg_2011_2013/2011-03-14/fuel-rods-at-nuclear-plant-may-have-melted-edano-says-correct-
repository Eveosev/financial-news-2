(Corrects spelling of Edano’s name in second paragraph.)  Fuel rods at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear power plant may have melted when water levels fell,  Japan ’s top government spokesman said.  Rods in the Nos. 1, 2 and 3 reactors may have melted, Chief
Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said to reporters in a briefing
today. Molten rods would increase the risk of a meltdown.  Tokyo Electric Power Co., the operator of the nuclear power
plant, stopped pumping seawater into its Nos. 1 and 3 reactors
earlier today because it needed to use the one working water
pump on the No. 2 reactor to cool it down, said Nishiyama
Hidehiko, director general at Japan’s trade ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
