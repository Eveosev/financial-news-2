  Tokyo  Electric Power Co. can’t rule
out that the fuel rods are melting at the Fukushima Dai Ichi No.
2 reactor, heightening the risk of a meltdown, after water
levels dropped, exposing them a second time.  An air flow gauge was accidentally turned off causing air
pressure into the reactor to rise suddenly and blocking the flow
of cooling water, the company said in a press conference on
national broadcaster NHK’s website. Tokyo Electric is now
attempting to reopen the valve to release pressure building
inside the reactor and inject water to cool the rods, the
company said.  This was the second time the fuel rods have been exposed at
the earthquake-stricken nuclear power plant 220 kilometers (135
miles) north of Tokyo. Earlier yesterday Cabinet Secretary Yukio
Edano said the fuel rods may have melted after heat evaporated
the water, leaving them fully exposed.  Radiation levels reached a record 3,130 microsieverts an
hour at the monitoring site near the gate of the plant as of
9:37 p.m. March 14 local time, twice the previous record.
Radiation had retreated to 326.2 microsieverts per hour at 10:35
p.m., the utility said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
