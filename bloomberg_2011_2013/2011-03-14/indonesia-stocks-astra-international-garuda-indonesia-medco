Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  advanced 27.61 points, or 0.8
percent, to 3,569.84, the first increase in three days.  Coal producers: PT Adaro Energy (ADRO IJ),  Indonesia ’s
second-largest coal producer, rose 3.2 percent to 2,400 rupiah
and PT Indo Tambangraya Megah (ITMG IJ), the local unit of  Thailand ’s largest coal miner Banpu Pcl, jumped 6.2 percent to
45,500 rupiah, the steepest increase since Jan. 3.  The March 11 earthquake that struck  Japan  may increase
demand for coal following a shutdown of some nuclear  power
plants , Herman Koeswanto, an analyst at PT Mandiri Sekuritas,
wrote in a note today.  PT Garuda Indonesia (GIAA IJ), Indonesia’s largest airline,
gained 3.8 percent to 550 rupiah after crude oil futures fell,
improving the outlook for lower fuel costs. Oil declined for a
fifth day, losing as much as 2.7 percent to $98.47 a barrel in
after-hours trading in  New York .  PT United Tractors (UNTR IJ), Indonesia’s biggest heavy
equipment supplier that sells Komatsu Ltd. excavators and other
machinery, declined 4.3 percent to 22,400 rupiah, the sharpest
drop since Jan. 21. Komatsu’s plants in Japan were hit by the
tsunami following the March 11 quake and this may affect
supplies of heavy equipment to United Tractors, analysts at CLSA
Asia-Pacific Markets led by Sarina Lesmina wrote in a note
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
