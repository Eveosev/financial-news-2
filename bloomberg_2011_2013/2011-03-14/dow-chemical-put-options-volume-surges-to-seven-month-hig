  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  put volume rose to
its highest level since August with most of the trading
concentrated in contracts with a strike price 4.4 percent below
today’s close.  More than 28,000 puts to sell the stock of the biggest U.S.
chemical maker changed hands today, four times the four-week
average and 2.5 times the number of calls to buy. The most-
traded contracts were the June $35 puts, which accounted for
more than half of all put trading. Midland, Michigan-based Dow
fell for a fourth day, dropping 0.5 percent to $36.61.  Dow’s implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices,
for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose to 35.17 from
32.19 on March 11.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
