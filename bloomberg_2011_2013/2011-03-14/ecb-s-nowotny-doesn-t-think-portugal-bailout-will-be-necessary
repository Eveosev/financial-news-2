Council member Ewald Nowotny doesn’t believe a bailout of  Portugal  will be necessary, Reuters reported citing an
interview.  “With the set of information (available) under the present
circumstances I do not consider this necessary, but we are all
aware that there is of course a high degree of uncertainty,”
Nowotny told the newswire, adding that he didn’t “see any
direct connection” between Portugal and  Spain , where the
situation was “very different.”       Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
