The pound posted its first weekly
advance in a month versus the dollar after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said America’s economy still needed
stimulus, weakening the U.S. currency.  Sterling strengthened from a three-year low against the
greenback even after a government report showed Britain’s
industrial output unexpectedly shrank in May. U.K. government
bonds rose this week, with 10-year yields falling the most in
four months, before the Bank of England publishes the minutes of
its July meeting, the first led by new Governor  Mark Carney .  “The pound’s rebound this week against the dollar was
driven mostly by Mr. Bernanke’s comments, which led to a selloff
in the dollar,”  Lee Hardman , a foreign-exchange strategist at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  London . “That doesn’t
change our view that the pound will resume its weakness. We
think the  Bank of England  under Carney will be more aggressive
with its accommodative policy than expected by the market.”  The pound strengthened 1.4 percent this week to $1.5103 at
5:13 p.m. in London yesterday after sliding to $1.4816 on July
9, the weakest level since June 2010. The U.K. currency
depreciated 0.2 percent to 86.36 pence per euro.  Sterling will decline to $1.48 by year-end and be little
changed at 85 pence per euro, Hardman said, citing Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi’s forecasts.  “Highly accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable
future is what’s needed in the  U.S. economy ,” Bernanke said on
July 10 in response to a question following a speech in
Cambridge,  Massachusetts . The pound jumped 1 percent against the
dollar that day and 1.1 percent the following day.  Manufacturing Contracts  U.K. manufacturing fell 0.8 percent in May from April, when
it declined 0.2 percent, the  Office for National Statistics  said
on July 9. The median forecast of 25 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was an increase of 0.4 percent increase.  The pound has declined 2 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10 developed-nation currencies. The dollar rose 6.4 percent and the euro
gained 5 percent.  The U.K. recovery “remains weak” by historical standards
and rising market interest rates pose a threat to the economy,
the Bank of England said in a statement released after its July
3-4 policy meeting. The central bank will release the minutes of
the gathering on July 17.  Ten-year gilts rose for the first week in a month, with the
benchmark yield dropping 16 basis points to 2.33 percent, the
biggest decline since the period ended March 1. The 1.75 percent
security due in September 2022 rose 1.25, or 12.50 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 95.26.  U.K. government securities handed investors a loss of 3
percent this year through July 11, according to Bloomberg World
Bond Indexes. German bonds dropped 1.1 percent and Treasuries
declined 2.7 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
