New Manchester City manager Manuel
Pellegrini may be ready to make a bid for Paris Saint-Germain
striker Zlatan Ibahimovic, the Daily Mirror said.  Ibrahimovic has already fallen out with new PSG coach
Laurent Blanc, who was hired 18 days ago, and has told his agent
to open negotiations with Real Madrid, the Mirror said.  The Swede is willing to take a pay cut to move to Spain,
but new Real coach Carlo Ancelotti, who led PSG to the French
title last season, spiked the move after making a “no
poaching” agreement when he left his former club, the Mirror
said.  That could open the door for Pellegrini, the Mirror said.
While City has yet to make a formal bid, Ibrahimovic is keen to
prove himself in the Premier League, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
