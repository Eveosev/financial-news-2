Alex Rodriguez  remained silent
during a four-hour meeting yesterday with Major League Baseball
officials, the New York Daily News reported without saying where
it got the information. MLB is preparing to suspend the New York
Yankees’ third baseman for violating drug rules.  Rodriguez is among as many as 20 players said to face
suspension in the league’s investigation of Biogenesis, a South
Florida anti-aging clinic that allegedly distributed
performance-enhancing drugs, the newspaper said.  Rodriguez and 10 other players are said to have invoked a
baseball rule that allows them to avoid self-incrimination,
according to the report.  The meeting was said to include Rodriguez, his counsel, two
MLB officials and two representatives of the MLB Players
Association, the Daily News said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
