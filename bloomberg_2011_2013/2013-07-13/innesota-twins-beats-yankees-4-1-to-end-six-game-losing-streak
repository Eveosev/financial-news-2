Trevor Plouffe, Ryan Doumit and
Pedro Florimon each hit home runs to help the Minnesota Twins
beat the New York Yankees 4-1 to end a six-game losing streak.  “Exciting baseball game,” said Twins manager Ron Gardenhire, who was ejected yesterday in the eighth inning for
arguing a call at first base. “That was needed. It’s been a
tough go here to get a win, so to see the guys smile again is
very exciting.”  Plouffe and Doumit hit solo homers at Yankee Stadium and
Florimon added a two-run shot as the Twins beat New York for the
first time in six games this season. Robinson Cano hit a run-scoring single for the Yankees.  “It’s a big sigh of relief,” Doumit told reporters.
“This has been a tough road trip, no doubt.”  Samuel Deduno (5-4) allowed one run over seven innings to
pick up the win, while Glen Perkins worked a scoreless ninth
inning for his 21st save.  “Everything was around the plate and everything was
working today,” Deduno said.  New York starter Phil Hughes (4-9) allowed all four runs
and struck out 10 in 7 1/3 innings to take the loss.  “I thought it was some of the better stuff he’s had all
year,” Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. “I think he threw the
ball exceptionally well except for a few mistakes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
