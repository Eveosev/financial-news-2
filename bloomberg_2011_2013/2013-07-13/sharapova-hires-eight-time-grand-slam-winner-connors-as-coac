Maria Sharapova  has hired eight-time
Grand Slam tennis champion  Jimmy Connors  as her new coach, one
day after splitting with Thomas Hogstedt.  “I have known Jimmy for many years and we briefly worked
together in 2008 just before the Australian Open,” Sharapova,
ranked No. 2 by the WTA Tour, said in a statement on her
 website . “I am really excited about our new partnership and
looking forward to the upcoming tournaments.”  Sharapova, 26, was knocked out in the second round at
Wimbledon last month by qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito of
Portugal. The Russian began working with Hogstedt in 2010 and
won the French Open two years later to complete the career Grand
Slam of claiming all four major championships at least once.  Connors, 60, won 109 singles titles during a 20-year career
and was ranked No. 1 in the world three times, including a
three-year run from 1974 to 1977. He retired from the ATP Tour
in 1991 and was elected to the Tennis Hall of Fame seven years
later. In 2008, he quit as  Andy Roddick ’s coach after 19 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
