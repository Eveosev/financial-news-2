Italy’s Matteo Trentin won the 14th
stage of the  Tour de France  in a sprint finish, while Chris Froome retained the race leader’s yellow jersey.  Trentin passed Switzerland’s Michael Albasini at the end of
the 191-kilometer (119-mile) ride from Saint-Pourcain-sur-Sioule
to Lyon, with Andrew Talansky of the U.S. third.  It was the Omega-Pharma team’s fourth stage victory in this
year’s race. British sprinter  Mark Cavendish  has two of the
wins, while German Tony Martin took the other in a time trial.  Froome, a Briton born in Kenya, was part of a pack
finishing more than seven minutes behind Trentin. The Team Sky
rider is two minutes, 28 seconds ahead of Bauke Mollema of the
Netherlands, with Spain’s two-time winner  Alberto Contador  of
the Saxo team 17 seconds further back in third.  “He’s in great shape and we can’t wait to get onto
tomorrow,” Team Sky manager Dave Brailsford said of Froome in
an interview with Eurosport. “We think it’s a stage that’s
going to be exciting.”  Tomorrow’s 15th stage, a 242.5-kilometer mountainous ride
from Givors to Mont Ventoux, is the longest of the 100th Tour.  “A climb like Mont Ventoux at the end of a 240-kilometer
stage, that’s brutal,” Froome told Eurosport. “I’m expecting
big gaps in the general classification tomorrow night.”  The race, which covers 3,404 kilometers, ends July 21 on
the  Champs Elysees  in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
