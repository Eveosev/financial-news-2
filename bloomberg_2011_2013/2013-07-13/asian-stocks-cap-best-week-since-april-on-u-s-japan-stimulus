Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index capping its biggest weekly advance since April,
after the U.S. and Japanese central banks signaled they will
maintain measures to boost their economies.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , the Japanese carmaker that gets about 34
percent of sales from North America, climbed 3.7 percent.
Newcrest Mining Ltd.,  Australia ’s biggest gold producer, jumped
13 percent as the price of the precious metal rose for the first
time in four weeks. Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. advanced
9.4 percent in Hong Kong after the world’s largest jewelry chain
reported an increase in sales.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 2.7 percent to 134.88 this
week. The gauge has rebounded 7.9 percent from a 2013 low on
June 25 as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the
U.S. will maintain accommodative monetary policy and the Bank of
 Japan  pledged to maintain unprecedented measures to stimulus the
economy.  “Economic growth in the U.S. will continue to improve and
the Fed won’t start tapering until the end of the year,”  Daphne Roth , Singapore-based head of Asia equity research at ABN Amro
Private Bank, which oversees about $207 billion, said by
telephone. “The Bank of Japan will continue with monetary
policy, fiscal policy and, with support in the upper house,
hopefully growth strategies as well. We are quite positive on
equities.”  ‘Highly Accommodative’  Bernanke, who sparked a stock and bond rout in May after
signaling the Fed’s asset buying could be reduced this year,
said this week that “highly accommodative” monetary policy
will be needed for the “foreseeable future.”  Minutes of the Fed’s June meeting showed that while
“several members judged that a reduction in asset purchases
would likely soon be warranted,” many want to see further
improvement in the labor market before reducing the central
bank’s $85 billion-a-month  quantitative easing  program.  Through yesterday the MSCI Asia Pacific Index has fallen
6.6 percent from a five-year high on May 20 amid concern the Fed
will begin tapering its stimulus as  China ’s economy slows and
Japan puts off unveiling economic reforms until after upper-house elections this month. Shares on the gauge yesterday traded
at 13.2 times average estimated earnings compared with multiples
of 15.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13.2 times for
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  BOJ Stays Course  The Bank of Japan maintained course on its unprecedented
monetary stimulus at the end of its two-day policy meeting on
July 11 and upgraded its view of the economy, referring to a
recovery for the first time since before a record 2011
earthquake.  Japanese shares rallied for a fourth week, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index gaining 1.1 percent this week and the benchmark Nikkei 225
Stock Average rising 1.4 percent. South Korea’s Kospi index
advanced 2 percent, while  Taiwan ’s Taiex index jumped 2.7
percent.  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index climbed 2.1 percent,
extending gains for a third week, as the nation’s economy grew
at the fastest pace in more than two years.  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  increased 2.7 percent, while
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 1.8 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang
Seng Index rose 2 percent, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index of mainland companies added 2.4 percent.  China’s Shanghai Composite rose 1.6 percent, extending
gains for a second week, amid speculation the government will
take measures to bolster the world’s second-largest economy
after exports contracted by most since 2009 in June.  ‘Targeted’ Policy  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang may announce “targeted” policy
support measures in coming months, boosting investment in urban
infrastructure, affordable housing and public services to
bolster domestic consumption,  Jian Chang , a Hong-Kong based
economist at Barclays Plc, wrote in a note to clients.  Chinese  developers  gained this week. China Overseas Land &
Investment Ltd., the biggest mainland developer traded in Hong
Kong, jumped 7.5 percent to HK$21.55 in Hong Kong. China
Resources Land Ltd. gained 5.8 percent to HK$21.80. Agile
Property Holdings Ltd. increased 5.1 percent to HK$8.09.  Exporters also advanced. Nissan advanced 3.7 percent on the
week to 1,095 yen in  Tokyo . Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s
biggest smartphone maker, climbed 3.6 percent to 1.312 million
won in  Seoul .  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , a building materials
supplier that gets about 70 percent of sales from the U.S., rose
1 percent to A$9.86 in Sydney.  Gold, Oil  All 10  industry groups  in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
advanced this week, with raw material producers leading the
gains after gold posted its biggest weekly advance since October
2011, while copper and oil rose. Newcrest jumped 13 percent to
A$12.09 in Sydney.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining
company and Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, climbed 5.4 percent
to A$33.31.  Chow Tai Fook climbed 9.4 percent to HK$8.94 in Hong Kong.
Same-store sales for the three months ended June 30 increased 48
percent from a year earlier, the company said on July 9.  ABC-Mart Inc. (2670)  gained 7.3 percent to 4,320 yen in Tokyo this
week after the Japanese shoe retailer reported first-quarter
profit rose 15 percent.  Among stocks that declined, Asiana Airlines Inc. retreated
5.1 percent to 4,860 won in Seoul after one of its planes
crashed at San Francisco International Airport on July 6. Three
of the 307 people on board died.  Olympus Corp., the world’s biggest maker of endoscopes,
fell 3.8 percent to 3,005 yen. The company plans to sell as much
as 118 billion yen ($1.2 billion) of shares overseas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
