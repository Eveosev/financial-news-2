San Francisco International Airport
has all four of its runways open for the first time in almost a
week after  Asiana Airlines Inc. (020560) ’s Flight 214 crash-landed July 6
on runway 28L.  The fourth runway reopened today at 5:05 p.m. local time,
the airport said in a  statement . Southwest Airlines Co. was the
first to land on the reopened runway.  The National Transportation Safety Board released the
runway to the airport on July 10 and released the airfield
yesterday. The fuselage of the Boeing Co. 777 was moved from the
site today and transported to temporary storage, the airport’s
statement said. The  Federal Aviation Administration  made a
series of flyover flights this afternoon to check the navigation
systems and the alignment of runway lights and other markings.  The airport closed 28L after the Asiana plane slammed its
tail into a seawall at the end of the runway, then crashed and
caught fire. Three of its 307 passengers were killed and more
than 200 were taken to hospitals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
