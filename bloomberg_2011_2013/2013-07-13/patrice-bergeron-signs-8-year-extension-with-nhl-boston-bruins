Patrice Bergeron signed an eight-year extension that will keep him a Boston Bruin until the 2021-22 National Hockey League season.  Bergeron, 27, has a year left on the three-year deal he
signed during the 2011 preseason. The new contract, with an
annual salary cap figure of $6.5 million a year, takes effect in
the 2014-15 season.  “I’m really happy now to see that I will hopefully retire
a Bruin,” Bergeron said. “That’s the goal and that’s what I
want.”  Bergeron would have become an unrestricted free agent after
the 2013-14 season. The center had 10 goals and 22 assists for
32 points in 42 games during the regular season.  “It wasn’t any question that he’d be able to get more on
the open market,” Bruins General Manager Peter Chiarelli said.
“We’ve seen his performance over the years. We saw a gutty
performance this year in the playoffs. We’re really happy that
we can get Patrice signed to a long-term extension.”  The Bruins reached the Stanley Cup playoffs, losing 4-2 to
the Chicago Blackhawks in the final series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
