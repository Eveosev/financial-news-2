Kloeckner & Co SE (KCO) , the German steel
trader part-owned by the Knauf family, expects a pretax loss
this year because of the industry’s crisis in Europe, Chief
Financial Officer Marcus Ketter said.  “For a positive result before taxes we needed a very
strong second half,” Ketter said in an interview in today’s
Boersenzeitung newspaper. “It is not conceivable.” His
comments were confirmed by Christian Pokropp, a Kloeckner
spokesman.  Dwindling demand for steel from the auto and construction
industries in Europe and increased competition from  China  have
curbed prices and squeezed profit margins as producers grapple
with surplus capacity. Kloeckner said in March it forecast net
profit for 2013, without giving a figure.  “It just doesn’t improve. I expect a net loss” for 2013,
Marc Gabriel, an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe KG in Dusseldorf,
said today by phone. Pokropp declined to comment on whether a
loss before taxes would mean a net loss.  The company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization in the three months ended June 30 were “in the
lower half” of its forecast range of 35 million euros ($46
million) to 45 million euros, Ketter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
