England claimed three late wickets
to put itself in position to win the opening Test of the Ashes
cricket series against Australia.  Australia’s late collapse left it 174-6 and needing 137
runs on Sunday’s final day at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. The
visitors were set a record target of 311 to win after  Ian Bell 
scored 109 as England was dismissed for 375.  Australia made a strong start to its second innings,
reaching 84 not out before Shane Watson was trapped leg-before-wicket by  Stuart Broad  for 46.  Joe Root then dismissed Ed Cowan with the final ball before
tea, and Chris Rogers was caught by Bell from James Anderson to
leave Australia at 124-3. England then took three wickets for
three runs to gain the upper hand. Brad Haddin will resume on 11
on Sunday, July 14, with Ashton Agar on one.  The late flurry began when  Michael Clarke  edged to Bell.
The Australian captain challenged the call of umpire Aleem Dar,
which was upheld by review.  Steve Smith  was dismissed lbw by Graeme Swann with the very
next ball. Phil Hughes was out in the same manner two overs
later, leaving Australia at 164-6. Haddin and Agar, who made 98
in Test debut in the first innings, were then able to see out
the remainder of the day.  No team has ever chased more than 284 to win a Test match
at Trent Bridge.  Earlier, Bell, who made his 18th Test century, teamed for a
seventh-wicket stand of 138 with Broad, who made 65.  To contact the reporter on this story:
