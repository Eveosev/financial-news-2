Australia is 111-2 as it chases the
target of 311 set by England to win the opening Test of the

14 by Joe Root with the final ball before tea on day four at
Trent Bridge in Nottingham. Opener Shane Watson was trapped leg-before-wicket by  Stuart Broad  for 46.  Earlier,  Ian Bell  scored 109 as England was dismissed for
375 in its second innings. Bell shared a seventh-wicket stand of
139 with Broad, who made 65.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
