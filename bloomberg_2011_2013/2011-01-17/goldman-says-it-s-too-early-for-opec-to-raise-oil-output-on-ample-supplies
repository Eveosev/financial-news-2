The discount of West Texas
Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, to North Sea Brent will
narrow to $7 a barrel from about $12 currently as U.S.
refineries resume operations,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc . said.  Brent futures surged to a two-year high of $108.70 a barrel
yesterday as intensifying violence in Libya, holder of Africa’s
largest crude reserves, heightened concern that supplies may be
disrupted. It would take half of OPEC’s spare production
capacity to replace Libya’s output, Goldman said in a research
note today.    London ’s Brent contract, normally cheaper than WTI, is
about $12 more expensive than the U.S. benchmark as inventories
at the nation’s storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, increase while
nearby refiners conduct seasonal maintenance.  “The recent collapse has reflected a dislocation of the
U.S. midcontinent from the world oil market,” analysts led by  David Greely  in  New York  wrote in the report. “We expect the
WTI-Brent spread to continue to narrow to $7 a barrel in the
near-term as the affected refineries were reportedly ramping
back up as of the end of last week.”  Goldman predicts WTI’s discount versus Brent will be at
$5.50 a barrel in five months, $4.50 in six months, and $3.50 in
a year.  The bank reduced its projection of WTI prices over those
time periods to $97.50, $100.50, and $103, while raising its
Brent forecasts to $103, $105 and $106.50 a barrel.  Political unrest across North  Africa  and the Middle East
may cause prices to exceed these targets, Goldman added. Libyan
production will be about 1.6 million barrels a day this year,
according to the bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
