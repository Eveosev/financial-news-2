Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS,
 Turkey ’s biggest mobile-phone operator, should discuss only a
dividend payment proposal if an extraordinary  shareholders’
meeting  is held today, Bloomberg HT reported, citing Murat
Vargi, a founder and minority shareholder in Turkcell.  Turkcell won’t be able to hold the meeting after the market
regulator published new rules late yesterday on appointment of
independent board members, Vargi said, according to the
Istanbul-based news channel. Vargi called for four independent
members to be elected to Turkcell board on Oct. 7 to prevent a
shareholder dispute from harming minority investors.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
