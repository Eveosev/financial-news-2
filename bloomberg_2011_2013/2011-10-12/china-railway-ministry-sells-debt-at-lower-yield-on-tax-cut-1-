China’s Ministry of Railways sold
seven-year bonds at a lower coupon than its last auction of
five-year debt, as a  tax cut  on interest income lured investors
back after a high-speed train accident hurt confidence.  The rail operator, the nation’s biggest issuer of corporate
debt, sold 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) of seven-year notes at
5.59 percent today, 34 basis points lower than the rate on the
five-year debt sold on Sept. 7. The ministry also sold another
10 billion yuan of 20-year bonds at 6 percent, according to a
statement on the Chinese bond clearing house website. The
Ministry of Finance said Oct. 11 companies investing in railway
bonds issued between 2011 and 2013 will have the levies on their
interest earnings halved.  “The ministry has undertaken a lot of measures to regain
investors’ confidence, including the tax cuts,” said Shi Lei,
head of fixed-income research in Beijing at Ping An Securities
Co., a unit of the nation’s second-biggest insurance company.
“Liquidity has eased and the  bond market  has become more
vibrant. That increased demand for the bonds as well.”  Ten-year borrowing costs for the rail operator, the
nation’s biggest issuer of corporate debt, have jumped 51 basis
points, or 0.51 percentage point, to 6.1386 percent since two
high-speed trains collided on July 23 in the eastern city of
Wenzhou, killing 40 people. The ministry removed three top
regional railway officials from their posts and suspended
approvals on new projects nationwide, while 54 similar trains
were recalled.  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of funding
availability in the financial system, has fallen 570 basis
points from its 2011 high of 9.04 percent. It fell 86 basis
points today to 3.34 percent at 12:05 p.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
