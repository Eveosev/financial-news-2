Moser Baer India Ltd. (MBI) , the country’s
second-largest solar-cell maker, completed the biggest sun-
powered plant in India.  The 4.65 billion rupee ($95 million) project in Gujarat
state, which uses thin-film panels supplied by  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) ,
DuPont Co., and Moser Baer, has a capacity of 30 megawatts, the
New Delhi-based company said today.  That makes it the largest solar plant commissioned to date
in India, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data. It
will generate 52 million kilowatt-hours or enough electricity
for 50,000 homes per day, according to the e-mailed statement.  Moser Baer’s solar division, which also works as a
contractor for other companies, plans to build 300 megawatts of
sun-powered projects in India,  Germany , Italy and the U.K. over
the next 12 months, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
