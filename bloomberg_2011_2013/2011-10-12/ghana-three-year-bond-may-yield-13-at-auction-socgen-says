Ghana’s offer of 300 million cedis
($185 million) in three-year bonds tomorrow may yield 13
percent, the same rate as the previous auction of the duration
held in June, according to  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA.  “Rising domestic inflationary pressures and fiscal
uncertainties ahead of an election year with the
2012 budget still due to be announced may dampen investor
interest in the issue,” according to an e-mailed note from the
lender’s emerging markets analysts including Nalini Cundapen and
Anne Benoit. “The currency’s poor performance over the last few
months also lends support to the view that foreign interest will
be minimal.”  The Ghanaian cedi has weakened 8.4 percent this year as
demand by importers for dollars has climbed amid a world Bank
forecast for economic growth of 20 percent this year. Inflation
in September was 8.4 percent, unchanged from the two previous
months, the Ghana Statistical Service said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
