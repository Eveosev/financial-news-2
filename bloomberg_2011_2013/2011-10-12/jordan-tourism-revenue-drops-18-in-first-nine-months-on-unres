Jordanian tourism revenue declined
18 percent in the first nine months of 2011 from a year earlier
because of regional turmoil, the  Jordan  Times said, citing a
report by the Ministry of Tourism.  Revenue dropped to 1.544 billion dinars ($2.17 billion)
from 1.876 billion dinars, the newspaper said. The number of
visitors fell 13 percent during the first nine months of this
year to 5.1 million from 5.9 million, it said.  Protests, some of them violent, have been taking place in
Jordan since the start of the year amid regional revolts that
ousted the longstanding leaders of Tunisia, Egypt, and  Libya ,
and conflict in Syria and Yemen.  Tourism revenue makes up about 14 percent of gross domestic
product in Jordan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
