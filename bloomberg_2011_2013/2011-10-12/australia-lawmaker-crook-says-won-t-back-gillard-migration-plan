Australian lawmaker Tony Crook said
today he won’t support Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s proposal
to send asylum-seekers abroad for processing. Crook won’t back
the plan for “humanitarian’’ reasons, he said in a news
conference with reporters in Canberra broadcast on Australian
Broadcasting Corp. television. The proposal is due for a vote
today in  Australia ’s lower house of parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
