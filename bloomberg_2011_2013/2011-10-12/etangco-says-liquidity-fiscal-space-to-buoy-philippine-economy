The  Philippines  has sufficient
liquidity, a stable  exchange rate  and a “manageable” inflation
outlook along with “fiscal space” to help support economic
growth, central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said today.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will consider global
developments, including  Indonesia ’s rate cut and the slump in
Philippine exports in next week’s policy meeting, Tetangco said
in an email reply to questions. “In most jurisdictions,
inflation seems to have become less of a pressing concern,” he
said. “The weakness in advanced economies is seen to weigh more
on emerging economies than previously anticipated,” he said.  While “the Philippines is not immune to what’s happening
externally,” the domestic environment “will help sustain
growth,” the governor said. “If the fiscal stimulus does its
job, this should give the necessary push to keep our economic
growth in a solid upward trajectory. For our part, the BSP has
policy flexibility. We will ensure that our policy stance
remains supportive of growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
