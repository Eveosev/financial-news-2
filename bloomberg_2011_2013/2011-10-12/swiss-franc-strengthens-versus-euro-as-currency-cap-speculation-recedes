The franc strengthened against the
euro as investors pared expectations that the  Swiss National
Bank  will adjust its cap to further weaken the currency.  Switzerland ’s currency surged versus the dollar,
strengthening through 90 centimes for the first time this month,
as European stocks climbed and investors reduced demand for the
perceived safety of the greenback. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index
rose 1.5 percent amid optimism the European Union bank
recapitalization proposals may help to stem the debt crisis.  An adjustment of the SNB ceiling “isn’t likely going to
happen,” said  Chris Walker , a currency strategist at UBS AG in
London. The market is today “getting rid of those rumors and
pricing against that,” he said.  The franc strengthened 0.3 percent to 1.2355 per euro at
4:20 p.m.  London  time. It jumped 1.6 percent to 89.44 centimes
per dollar.  The SNB imposed a ceiling on the franc for the first time
in more than three decades on Sept. 6, pledging to defend the
target with the “utmost determination.”  InterContinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback versus the currencies of six trading partners,
fell 0.9 percent today.  Franc strength “is coming from a lot of dollar selling,”
Walker said. “You can’t really view the Swiss franc as a haven
anymore because it has the floor. That type of dynamic has
completely changed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
