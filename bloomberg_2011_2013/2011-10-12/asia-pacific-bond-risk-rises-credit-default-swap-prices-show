The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment increased,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index jumped 10 basis points to
204.5 basis points as of 9:25 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc.
prices show. A close of 204.5 would be the highest since Oct. 7,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 3 basis points to 223 as of 8:40
a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 2 basis points to
204 as of 11:25 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default, and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
