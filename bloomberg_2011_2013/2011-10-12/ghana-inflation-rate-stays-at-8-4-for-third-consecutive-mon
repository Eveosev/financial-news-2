Ghana ’s inflation rate was unchanged
for a third consecutive month in September, adding to
expectations the central bank may keep  interest rates  on hold.  The inflation rate stayed at 8.4 percent,  Grace Bediako , a
statistician at the  Ghana  Statistical Service, told reporters in
the capital, Accra, today.  “Apart from the weakening of the currency against the
dollar, all other economic pointers largely behaved well,” Nii
Ampa-Sowa, head of research at Accra-based  Databank Financial
Services Ltd. , said before today’s data.  The central bank may leave its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 12.5 percent for a second consecutive meeting on
Oct. 19, Ampa-Sowa said. The  Bank of Ghana  cut the key rate
twice this year as inflation eased, holding it steady on Sept. 1
as rising electricity and water costs threatened to boost
inflation. The cedi slumped 4.7 percent against the dollar in
September, extending its decline this year to 8.4 percent,
adding to price pressures.  Inflation has eased since reaching a five-year high of 20.7
percent in June 2009. A 30 percent increase in petroleum costs
pushed the inflation rate to 9.2 percent in February from 9.1
percent a month earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
