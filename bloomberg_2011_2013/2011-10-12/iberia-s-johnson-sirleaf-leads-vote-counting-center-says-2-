Liberian President and Nobel Peace
Prize winner Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf led in early unofficial
returns from yesterday’s election, according to a tally compiled
by the Liberia Media Center today.  Johnson-Sirleaf, 72, received 152,662 of the more than
300,000 votes counted, the Monrovia-based reporters’ association
said. About 1.8 million votes were cast.  Winston Tubman, a 70-year-old lawyer running under the
banner of the main opposition Congress for Democratic Change
(CDC), received 127,814 votes. Prince Yormie Johnson, a former
warlord and current senator, was in third place with 39,090,
according to the center’s data.  Liberia’s National Elections Commission will begin
releasing provisional results tomorrow, according to Chairman
James Fromoyan. A second round will be held if no candidate wins
more than 50 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
