Hungary has tied its support for
Serbia’s European Union candidacy to lawmakeres in Belgrade
changing a restitution law by December, the Foreign Ministry
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Hungary considers the law, passed by the Serbian parliament
last month, as discriminatory, the ministry said.  “We expect the Serbian side to solve this problem by early
December at the latest,” the ministry said. “That’s the only
way the European Council can muster the unanimous support
necessary to approve the candidacy on December 9.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
