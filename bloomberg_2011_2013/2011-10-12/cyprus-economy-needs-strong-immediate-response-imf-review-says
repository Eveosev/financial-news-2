Cyprus’s economy faces substantial
challenges and “bold” measures are needed to help jumpstart
the expansion, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  The eastern Mediterranean island-state will show little or
no growth this year and shrink slightly in 2012, the Washington-
based lender said in an annual review e-mailed by the Nicosia-
based  Central Bank  of Cyprus today.  Reversing the deterioration in public finances is urgent,
and the country must reduce a budget deficit of some 7 percent
of gross domestic product in 2011 to halt the rapid increase in
debt over the past three years, the IMF said.  “Decisive and credible measures to reverse the fiscal
slippage and put the public debt ratio on a declining path are
essential to restore access to capital markets, safeguard the
confidence of investors that underpins Cyprus’s role as an
international financial center, and protect the competitiveness
of the economy,” the IMF said.  Measures to achieve fiscal savings should focus mostly on
expenditure reductions, according to the statement. An overhaul
of the pension system is vital as the country faces one of the
largest increases in retirement costs in the 17-nation single-
currency area, with the system becoming unsustainable as the
population ages, the IMF said.  While Cyprus’s banking industry is a pillar of the economy,
financial turbulence in the region and lenders’ holdings of
Greek sovereign debt and presence in  Greece ’s retail-banking
market have hurt asset performance, profitability, and capital
and liquidity buffers, the IMF said.  Cyprus should be ready for further negative shocks and
undertake rigorous stress tests on banks to identify capital and
liquidity shortfalls under adverse scenarios, and require
lenders to strengthen buffers accordingly, the statement said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
