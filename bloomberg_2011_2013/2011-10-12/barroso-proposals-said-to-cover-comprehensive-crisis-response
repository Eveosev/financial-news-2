European Commission President  Jose
Barroso  will today lay out his vision of what the comprehensive
response to the debt crisis should encompass, a person familiar
with the matter said.  Barroso this afternoon will unveil proposals on
coordinating bank recapitalizations across the EU, on  Greece  and
private-sector participation in its bailout, and on the region’s
rescue funds, according to the person, who declined to be named
because the proposals aren’t yet public.  Barroso will announce the proposals, which also will cover
the economy and economic governance, in a speech to the European
Parliament at 3 p.m. in Brussels, the person said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
