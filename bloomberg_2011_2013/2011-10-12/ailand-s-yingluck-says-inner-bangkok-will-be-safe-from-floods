Parts of the Thai capital Bangkok
may be affected by floods later this week, though the city’s
commercial and tourist districts will remain safe, Prime
Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said.  Bangkok’s outer suburbs “may be at risk to be flooded,”
Yingluck said today. “But the amount of water won’t be much.
But the inner part of Bangkok, I believe it should be safe.”  Yingluck said there was no reason to declare a state of
emergency in the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
