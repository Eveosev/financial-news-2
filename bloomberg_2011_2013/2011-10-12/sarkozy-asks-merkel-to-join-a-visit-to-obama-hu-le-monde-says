French President Nicolas Sarkozy has
asked German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to travel with him to
Beijing and  Washington  this month for talks with Chinese and
U.S. leaders before a November summit of world leaders,  Le Monde
reported , citing an unnamed French official.  Sarkozy and Merkel would see President Barack Obama and
President  Hu Jintao , traveling after an Oct. 23 European Union
summit in Brussels where they will discuss plans to rescue
European banks and the euro-region crisis, the French newspaper
reported on its website today.  A German government spokesman in Berlin, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, said no such joint trip is
planned. Merkel is currently on a tour of Vietnam and Mongolia.
