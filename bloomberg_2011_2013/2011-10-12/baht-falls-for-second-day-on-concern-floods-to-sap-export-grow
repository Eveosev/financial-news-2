Thailand ’s baht dropped for a second
straight day on concern the nation’s worst floods in more than
half a century will crimp export growth. Government bonds fell.  Southeast Asia’s second-biggest economy will expand 3.7
percent this year, the  finance ministry  estimated this week.
That compares with a range of 3.8 percent to 4.3 percent it had
forecast last month. The floods, which have forced companies
including Honda Motor Co., Canon Inc. and Nikon Corp. to suspend
production, have damaged 762 factories in 28 provinces, deputy
government spokesman Chalitrat Chandrubeksa said yesterday.  “Thailand’s export outlook has deteriorated, and slower
export growth means slower economic growth,” said  Hideki
Hayashi , a specially appointed fellow at the Japan Center for
Economic Research in  Tokyo . “The baht will see downward
pressure.”  The baht fell 0.2 percent to 31.04 per dollar as of 8:18
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency is unlikely to weaken below 31.20 this week on concern
the central bank will intervene to slow the decline, Hayashi
said.  The yield on the government’s 5.25 percent bonds due May
2014 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.45
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
