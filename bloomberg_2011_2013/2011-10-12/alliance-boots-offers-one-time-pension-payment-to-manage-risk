Alliance Boots Holdings Ltd. said it
offered pensioners and their dependents a one-time payment in
return for giving up future increases linked to inflation on
part of the pension.  The payments will allow the U.K.’s largest drugstore chain,
acquired by KKR Inc. and partners for 12 billion pounds in 2007,
to manage the pension “funding position and the risks
associated with its pension liabilities more effectively,” the
company said in a statement on its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
