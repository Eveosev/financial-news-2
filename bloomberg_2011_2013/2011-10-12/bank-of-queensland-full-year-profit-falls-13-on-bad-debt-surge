Bank of Queensland Ltd. (BOQ) , Australia’s
worst performing bank stock this year, said full-year profit
fell 13 percent as bad debts almost doubled.  Net income in the 12 months ended Aug. 31 dropped to
A$158.7 million ($161 million) from A$181.9 million a year
earlier, the Brisbane-based bank said today. Bad debts jumped 92
percent from a year earlier to A$200.5 million as a “result of
one-off commercial deals, the current economic conditions, and
extreme weather events of early 2011,” the bank said.  Acting Chief Executive Officer Ram Kangatharan, who took
over the post after David Liddy stood down in August and will
pass the role to Stuart Grimshaw next month, is overseeing a
bank battered by natural disasters and waning property prices in
its home state. The highest borrowing costs in the developed
world have cut demand for loans in  Australia  to the weakest
level in more than three decades.  “Credit quality is the key risk that is holding back BOQ’s
returns and shareprice,” Sydney-based analysts led by John Buonaccorsi at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said in a note
dated Oct. 7. “Although the Queensland economy is now picking
up, a recovery in property valuations will lag the improvement
in the wider economy.”  Bad Debts  The shares rose 1.4 percent to A$8.10 in Sydney after
Kangatharan said bad debts “will fall” in the current fiscal
full year. The shares have slipped 22 percent this year. The
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 10.6 percent in 2011.  Liddy, CEO for more than 10 years, in February cut his
annual profit forecast for a second time after Queensland’s
worst floods since 1974 and cyclone Yasi. Liddy’s replacement by
Grimshaw was announced in August.  Retail deposits rose 1.5 times the system in the fiscal
full year, and loan growth expanded at 1.4 times the total
market, the bank said today.  Bank of Queensland’s underlying profit, which excludes one-
off bad debts and weather-related provisions, gained 18 percent
in the 12 months to A$447.4 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
