European Central Bank Governing
Council memberJens Weidmann said a restructuring of Greek debt
“can’t be ruled out,”  Germany ’s  Bild newspaper  reported,
citing an interview.  “A debt haircut mustn’t become an attractive way out of
self-imposed problems,” Weidmann, who also heads Germany’s
Bundesbank, told the newspaper. “Otherwise, confidence in the
sovereign debt of endangered countries won’t return.”  Weidmann also said that a repeated increase in the size of
the region’s rescue fund “can’t be the solution,” Bild
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
