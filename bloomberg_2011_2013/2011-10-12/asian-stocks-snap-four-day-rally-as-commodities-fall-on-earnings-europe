Stocks climbed, briefly erasing the
Dow Jones Industrial Average’s 2011 loss, while commodities
gained and Treasuries slid as European leaders provided a road
map of plans to tame the debt crisis and the  Federal Reserve 
said it discussed further asset purchases to boost growth.  The Dow rose 102.55 points, or 0.9 percent, to 11,518.85 at
the 4 p.m. close in New York and climbed as high as 11,625.3,
briefly wiping out a 2011 drop that reached 8 percent last week.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1 percent to 1,207.25,
its highest close in almost a month, and indexes in France,
Germany and Italy surged at least 2.2 percent. The 10-year
Treasury note’s yield increased six basis points to 2.21
percent, copper added 3.1 percent and the euro strengthened more
than 1 percent versus the dollar and yen.  The S&P 500 extended its rebound since Oct. 3 to almost 10
percent, the biggest gain over seven sessions since March 2009,
as financial and industrial companies led gains. European
Commission President  Jose Barroso  called for support for crisis-
hit banks, the payout of a sixth loan to  Greece  and a faster
start for a permanent rescue fund. Lawmakers in Slovakia, the
last euro nation to vote on an enhanced European bailout fund,
reached an agreement to approve the mechanism.  “The situation in  Europe  is going to take a heroic
effort,” Warren Koontz, head of U.S. large-cap value stocks at
Loomis Sayles & Co. in  Boston , which manages $150 billion, said
in a telephone interview. “At least for now, it seems that they
are making steps in the right direction. The fact that there’s a
road map is good. They are now starting to lay out a few more
concrete steps.”  Earnings Season  Walt Disney Co., Bank of America Corp., American Express
Co. and 3M Co. climbed at least 2.5 percent to help lead gains
in 25 of 30 stocks in the Dow. The  S&P 500  trimmed its 2011 loss
4 percent. PepsiCo Inc., the world’s largest snack-foods maker,
advanced 2.9 percent after earnings increased on higher sales of
Frito-Lay products. JPMorgan Chase & Co. climbed 2.8 percent and
Google Inc. advanced 1 percent before reporting results
tomorrow.  The rebound from a 13-month low on Oct. 3 has yet to bring
the S&P 500 out of a trading range it’s been stuck in for more
than two months. The benchmark index for U.S. stocks has
fluctuated between 1,074.77 and 1,230.71 since Aug. 5 as
investors remained cautious toward riskier assets amid
speculation Greece will default on its debt.  ‘Sustained Advance’  The 1,230 level is “where the rally was capped in late
August,” Roger Volz, director of equities at BGC Partners LP in
 New York , said in a telephone interview. “If we can close above
the previous major high, that would open the door for a
sustained advance.”  The S&P GSCI has rebounded more than 8 percent after
plunging 24 percent from its high for the year on April 8 to
Oct. 4. The Dollar Index has slipped 3.2 percent from a nine-
month high last week and the 10-year Treasury yield has
increased from a record low of 1.67 percent in September.  The cost of protecting against losses on Morgan Stanley
debt plunged to the lowest level in more than three weeks today
amid improving confidence in Europe’s efforts to tame the debt
crisis. Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley fell 45 basis
points to a mid- price of 350 basis points as of 11:04 a.m. New
York time, according to broker Phoenix Partners Group.  Default Protection  Credit-default swaps on Bank of America Corp. fell 28 to
335 and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s eased 13 to 132. Contracts on
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  declined 24 to 296, CMA data show. A
benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk fell for a second
day, reaching its lowest level in three weeks.  Coffee, copper, lead and silver increased at least 2
percent to lead gains in 16 of 24 commodities tracked by the S&P
GSCI. Gold futures climbed to a two-week high, rising 1.3
percent to settle at $1,682.60 an ounce. Crude oil fell for the
first time in six days, slipping 0.3 percent to $85.57 a barrel
to snap its longest streak of gains this year, after the
 International Energy Agency  cut its 2012 global demand forecast
and the dollar weakened.  French banks advanced today, with BNP Paribas and Societe
Generale SA up more than 5 percent, as Budget Minister Valerie
Pecresse said the government is willing to recapitalize lenders
unable to tap markets. Burberry Group Plc rose 3.5 percent as
the U.K.’s largest luxury-goods maker reported sales that beat
estimates.  Fiat SpA (F)  and Daimler AG helped lead a rally in
European automakers’ stocks, climbing at least 5.6 percent.  Treasury 30-year notes fell for a sixth session, pushing
the yield 10 basis points higher to 3.20 percent. Growing
confidence in European leaders’ efforts to fight the debt crisis
reduced the haven appeal of the 10-year notes sold at today’s
$21 billion auction.  Treasury Auction  The auction drew a 2.271 percent yield, the highest since
July, compared with the average forecast of 2.231 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of eight of the Federal Reserve’s 22
primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.86, the lowest since November 2010.  Equities climbed to their highs of the session as the Fed
said some officials last month wanted to keep further asset
purchases as an option to boost the economy as policy makers saw
“considerable uncertainty” that U.S. growth will pick up. Most
participants favored giving additional information on the
central bank’s goals and how they influence the Fed’s decisions,
and most “saw advantages” in tying the Fed’s near-zero
 interest rates  to more-specific developments in the economy, the
Fed said in minutes of the Sept. 20-21 session, released today.  European Bonds  Italy ’s 10-year bond yield rose 12 basis points to 5.74
percent, according to generic rates, and  Spain ’s note yield
increased nine basis points to 5.12 percent. The yield on the
Greek two-year note jumped 30 basis points to 73.50 percent
after climbing as much as 253 points. The two-year Irish yield
decreased 11 basis points to 7.41 percent, erasing earlier
gains. German 30-year bonds fell, with the yield rising 12 basis
points to 2.93 percent.  The euro strengthened 1.2 percent to $1.3794, the highest
level since September 16, and gained 2 percent to 106.60 yen
while the Dollar Index slid 0.8 percent. The pound jumped 1.2
percent to $1.5762 even after a report showed U.K. unemployment
rose to 8.1 percent, the highest in 15 years, in the three
months through August.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index climbed 1.5 percent,
bringing its six-day gain to 11 percent, the biggest rally since
July 2009.  Indonesia ’s Jakarta Composite Index surged 3 percent
after the central bank cut interest rates yesterday.  The Shanghai Composite Index rallied 3 percent, its biggest
gain in a year, amid speculation that  China  will boost support
for the equity market after valuations dropped to record-low
levels. As U.S. lawmakers move closer than ever to punishing
China for having an undervalued currency, trading in  Hong Kong 
suggests the yuan is too strong. The  U.S. Senate  passed a bill
on Oct. 11 that would allow sanctions on countries with
misaligned exchange rates.  Yuan Moves  The currency sank as much as 1.1 percent to 6.5463 per
dollar in the city yesterday, a record 2.4 percent discount to
the prevailing Shanghai rate, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The yuan has traded at a discount for almost four weeks,
undercutting the onshore rate by 1 percent on average, as
Europe’s debt crisis spurs demand for dollars. The premium
investors demand to hold China’s dollar-denominated debt instead
of  U.S. Treasuries  widened 53 basis points in the past month to
279 basis points, based on a JPMorgan Chase & Co. index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
