Nouriel Roubini, the co-founder and
chairman of Roubini Global Economics LLC., said European leaders
have to increase the size of the region’s rescue fund to at
least 2 trillion euros ($2.8 trillion) by early November to
safeguard Italy and Spain, German magazine Stern reported,
citing an interview.  It’s the responsibility of German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
to prevent a crash of global financial markets and a world
recession by acting speedily to expand the European Financial
Stability Facility, even if it jeopardizes  Germany ’s AAA rating,
Roubini was quoted as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
