U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary
Clinton  said the U.S. government is betting the Arab uprisings
that have toppled governments will “deliver for the people.”  Clinton said it was “unfortunate” that the U.S. hasn’t
offered a mini-Marshall Plan for the emerging democracies in the
 Middle East .  To contact the reporter on this story:
