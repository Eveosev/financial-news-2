The Czech Republic’s 2011 public
finance deficit will be less than 4 percent of economic output,
CTK reported, citing Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek.  “The deficit was approved at 4.6 percent and in the spring
we revised it to 4.2 percent, and today I am certain that the
final result will begin with the number 3,” the Prague-based
newswire quoted the minister as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
