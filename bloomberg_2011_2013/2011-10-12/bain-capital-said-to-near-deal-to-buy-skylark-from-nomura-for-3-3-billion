Bain Capital  LLC may reach an
agreement this month to buy family-restaurant chain Skylark Co.
from  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s largest brokerage, two people
with knowledge of the matter said.  The brokerage may sell Skylark to Bain in a deal valued at
about 250 billion yen ($3.3 billion) including debt, said one of
the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are
private. Another person familiar with the negotiations said in
March that Nomura’s principal finance unit and Bain were
discussing a sale.  Skylark would be at least the third sale by Nomura’s
private-equity unit this year as the Tokyo-based brokerage
focuses on expanding in overseas markets including the U.S.
Nomura last year ended investments in Huis Ten Bosch, a Japanese
holiday resort, and builder Misawa Homes Co.  Spokespeople for Nomura, Bain and Skylark declined to
comment.  Nomura led a management and employee buyout of Skylark in
2006. The chain, which started in 1970, operates about 3,700
restaurants, mainly in  Japan .  Nomura Principal Finance Co. owned 40.2 percent of shares
in Skylark and Nomura-led investors held 34.7 percent, according
to a financial statement by the restaurant operator in February.
The brokerage held 3.7 percent of preferred shares in Skylark.  Skylark posted profit of 7.9 billion yen on an
unconsolidated basis last year, with revenue of 242.1 billion
yen, the statement showed.  The Nikkei newspaper reported the timing for the Skylark
agreement earlier today, without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
