Peru ’s sol advanced to its highest
level in more than three years as copper, the nation’s top
export, rose on bets Europe will contain its sovereign debt
crisis and spur global demand for the metal.  The sol strengthened 0.2 percent to 2.7245 per  U.S. dollar 
at 11:41 a.m. Lima time, from 2.7310 yesterday. The currency
earlier advanced to 2.7215, its strongest since April 2008.  Copper rose as the European Union released a road map of
its plans to recapitalize banks and halt the region’s debt
turmoil, allaying concern the continent’s slowing economy will
derail global growth. Gold, Peru’s second-biggest export, also
gained.  “Optimism has returned,” said Ricardo Villamonte, the
head trader at Banco de Credito del Peru in  Lima . “There’s more
confidence that the situation in Europe will improve and won’t
affect the United States,  China  or Peru.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell for a sixth day, declining
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.74 percent,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
