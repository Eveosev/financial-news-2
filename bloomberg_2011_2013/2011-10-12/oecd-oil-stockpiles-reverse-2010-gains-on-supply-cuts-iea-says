Fuel inventories in member countries
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
have reversed last year’s increases to fall below the five-year
average as disruptions cut supply, the  International Energy
Agency  said.  Stockpiles stood at 2.692 billion barrels in August, the
Paris-based IEA said today in its monthly oil market report.
That’s 22.5 million below the average for the past five years,
compared with 119 million above the mean at the same time in
2010, according to the report.  The loss of Libyan oil production this year along with
strikes at French seaports contributed to the decline, it said.
Output from North Sea fields has also been curtailed in 2011 by
maintenance and Russian supplies have been redirected to  Asia ,
the IEA said.  “A lot has changed in one year,” the report said. “A
never ending chain of supply and refining outages caused by
various weather, labor, technical or political problems has
contributed to the steady erosion of OECD inventory levels.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
