The  European Central Bank  said
overnight deposits dropped to the lowest in two months.  Euro-region banks parked 62.2 billion euros ($84.9 billion)
at the ECB on the last day of the maintenance period, down from
269.2 billion euros the previous day. That’s the lowest level
since Aug. 10. The ECB yesterday absorbed 273.8 billion euros in
a fine-tuning tender to counter a “large positive liquidity
imbalance.”  Banks need to hold a certain amount of reserves on
average during an ECB maintenance period. This results in
fluctuations at the end of the period as lenders seek to balance
their accounts.  Financial institutions borrowed 4.2 billion euros at the
marginal rate of 2.25 percent, up from 2.9 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
