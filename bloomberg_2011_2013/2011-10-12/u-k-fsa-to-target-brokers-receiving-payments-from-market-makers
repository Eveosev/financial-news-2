The U.K.’s  Financial Services
Authority  proposed that brokers that receive payments from
market-makers in return for orders be forced to prove to clients
that the deal didn’t damage their trade.  The practice, known as payment for order flow, may “lead
to client detriment through breaches of our conflicts of
interest, inducements and best execution rules,” according to a
 report  on the FSA’s website today. Brokers would be banned from
accepting payments unless they can prove it doesn’t hurt
customers.  “It is difficult to see any advantage in the payment for
order flow arrangements for the end client,” the FSA said.
“For this reason, PFOF is a serious concern for the FSA.”  The European Commission, the 27-nation European Union’s
executive arm, is scheduled to propose this month an overhaul of
trading rules for financial markets following the 2008
contraction in the credit markets that followed the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
