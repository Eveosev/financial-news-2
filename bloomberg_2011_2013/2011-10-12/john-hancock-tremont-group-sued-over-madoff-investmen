Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance
Co. and John Hancock Life Insurance Co. USA were sued by a
limited-liability company that said they lost millions of the
company’s dollars to  Bernard Madoff ’s Ponzi scheme.  SSR II LLC bought variable life insurance policies from
John Hancock and Security Life of Denver Insurance Co. Through
the investment-account component of the policies, SSR invested
$13 million in a Tremont Group Holdings Inc. fund, according to
a lawsuit filed today in New York State Supreme Court.  The fund, through its fund-of-funds structure, allocated
22 percent of its assets to other funds, substantially all of
which went to Madoff, according to the complaint. MassMutual and
other defendants “maintained significant influence and/or
control over and provided substantial assistance to” various
Tremont entities, SSR said.  “Rather than managing a portfolio of underlying
securities, however, defendants funneled over one-fifth of
plaintiff’s investment to Madoff’s Ponzi scheme, where those
funds were dissipated,” SSR II said.  Representatives of Boston-based  John Hancock , MassMutual
and Security Life of Denver couldn’t be reached for comment
after normal business hours.  The case is SSR II LLC v. John Hancock Life Insurance Co.,
652793-2011, New York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
