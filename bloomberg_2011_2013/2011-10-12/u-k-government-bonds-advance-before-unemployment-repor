U.K. government bonds gained before
reports economists say will show jobless claims rose last month
while unemployment increased in August, weighing on prospects
for economic growth.  The advance pushed the yield on 10-year gilts down for the
first time in six days as the FTSE 100 Index declined, stoking
demand for safer assets. The pound was little changed versus the
dollar and the euro.  “The ongoing flow of poor data points to a weakening
recovery,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income strategist at Bank
of America Merrill Lynch Global Research in London. “There’s an
increasing propensity to own gilts.”  The 10-year gilt yield fell three basis points to 2.55
percent as of 8:24 a.m. in London. The 3.75 percent security due
September 2021 added 0.3, or 3 pound per 1,000 pound ($1,559)
face amount, to 110.405. Two-year yields were two basis points
lower at 0.61 percent.  The pound was less than 0.1 percent stronger at $1.5589 and
traded little changed at 87.54 pence per euro. Sterling climbed
0.1 percent to 119.53 yen.  “The market accepts that the growth path in the U.K. will
be subdued for some time,” said Chris Huddleston, a trader at
Investec Bank Plc in  London , which oversees about $95 billion in
assets. That may “weigh on the pound,” he added.  Jobless claims increased 24,000 in September after a 20,300
gain in August, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey. The ILO unemployment rate in the three months through
August probably increased to 8 percent, the highest since March
2010, a separate survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
