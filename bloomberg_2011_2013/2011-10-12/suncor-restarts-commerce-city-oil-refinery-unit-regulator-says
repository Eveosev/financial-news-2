Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  restarted a
gasoline-producing unit at its Commerce City refinery in
 Colorado  after a “malfunction,” said Shannon McMillan, a unit
supervisor for Colorado’s Air Pollution Control Division.  The unit was down for “a fairly short duration” and after
it was back online “Suncor experienced problems with the
compressor on the Plant 1 flare gas recovery system,” McMillan
said in an e-mail. “With the compressor being down, gases that
would normally be captured by the recovery system were instead
flared.”  The compressor was back online about 2 a.m. yesterday,
McMillan said.  Lisha Burnett, a company spokeswoman, did not immediately
return a phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
