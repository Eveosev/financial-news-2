Irish banks’ reliance on central
bank funding will be lower at the end of the year  than it was
at the start, according to John Moran, head of bank
restructuring at the finance ministry.  Banks “are now starting a trend” of deposit growth,
following a “catastrophic fall-off’ in deposits before lenders
were recapitalized, Moran said in a speech in Dublin today. He
said banks are also pressing ahead with deleveraging.  To contact the reporter on this story:
