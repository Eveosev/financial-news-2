The  New York  Jets traded wide
receiver Derrick Mason to the Houston Texans for a conditional
2012 draft choice, newspapers in New York and Houston reported.  Mason, 37, who was in his first season with the Jets after
spending eight with  Tennessee  and the last six with Baltimore,
had 13 catches for 115 yards this season.  “I thought Derrick would catch 80 to 90 balls,” Jets
coach  Rex Ryan  told reporters two days ago. “That hasn’t
happened.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
