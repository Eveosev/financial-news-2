Euro-region banks benefiting from
recapitalization by governments must accept state influence on
their supervisory and management boards and share their profits,
 Germany ’s  Handelsblatt  newspaper today cited Luxembourg Prime
Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  as saying.  Should a report by the International Monetary Fund, the
European Central Bank and the European Commission show that
Greece can’t sustain its debt burden under aid programs, “one
has to deal with the question of how Greek debt can be better
assured beyond a participation of the private sector,” Juncker,
who also chairs meetings of euro-region finance ministers, told
the newspaper in an Oct. 10 interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
