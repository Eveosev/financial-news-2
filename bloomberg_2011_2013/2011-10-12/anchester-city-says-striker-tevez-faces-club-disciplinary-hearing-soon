Manchester City  striker  Carlos Tevez 
will face a club disciplinary hearing “to answer of alleged
breaches of contract,” the English soccer team said today in a
 statement  on its website.  The team said Tevez, 27, an Argentinian international
player, will be required to report for practice tomorrow and
that a disciplinary hearing will be held soon.  Tevez was suspended with full pay pending a club probe
after Manchester City manager  Roberto Mancini  said Tevez refused
to be inserted as a substitute during the second half of a 2-0
loss on Sept. 27 in a Champions League game at Bayern Munich.  Tevez’s adviser, Kia Joorabchian, said the player never
refused his manager’s request to enter the game and that
comments he made in a television interview after the match were
mistranslated. The comments were translated as Tevez saying he
wasn’t “mentally right” to play.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
