Oil fell for the first day in six
after the  International Energy Agency  reduced its demand
forecast and the euro surged on European Union plans to help
banks. Brent oil’s premium to New York futures increased.  Futures snapped the longest winning streak this year as the
IEA cut 2012 demand estimates by 210,000 barrels a day and said
Libyan output will rebound to 600,000 barrels a day by year’s
end. Brent oil and the euro rose in London on speculation that
Europe’s debt problems will be resolved and after the U.S. said
Iran was linked to a plot to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador
to the U.S.  “Crude is latching onto the stronger euro and the optimism
that we’re going to see the European debt crisis contained,”
said  Matt Smith , a commodities analyst with Summit Energy
Services Inc. in Louisville, Kentucky.  Oil for November delivery fell 24 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
settle at $85.57 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the first decline since Oct. 4. Futures have fallen 6.4 percent
this year.  November oil dropped to $84.80 a barrel in electronic
trading after the trading floor closed, then rebounded to $85.04
at 4:32 p.m. after the American Petroleum Institute reported
that U.S. crude-oil stockpiles decreased 3.81 million barrels to
340.4 million.  The IEA reduced its world demand forecast to 90.5 million
barrels a day. That means consumption will increase by 1.3
million barrels a day, or 1.4 percent, from this year.  Brent oil for November settlement rose 63 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $111.36 on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange at 2:32 p.m. in New York.  Brent-WTI Spread  Brent expanded its premium to New York futures to $25.79 a
barrel, near the Sept. 6 record of $26.87 based on settlement
prices. The spread has widened for the past four days,
pressuring West Texas Intermediate oil futures traded in New
York and supporting Brent.  “People are playing the Brent-WTI spread because they
think the European situation is going to be resolved and they’re
going to use some oil in Europe,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “The other reason
is the Iranian situation. If we lose Iranian oil, it’s kind of
the same thing as losing Libyan oil, and that drove the spread
earlier this year.”  Libyan production dropped 97 percent this year to a low of
45,000 barrels a day in August as rebels deposed longtime leader
 Muammar Qaddafi , based on Bloomberg News estimates. Output
increased to 100,000 barrels a day in September as a
transitional government took over.  Iran  produced 3.59 million barrels a day last month, second
only to  Saudi Arabia  in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.  Condemnation of Iran  The U.S. will work closely with international partners to
condemn Iran and further isolate it, Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said in a speech in  Washington . She said the Islamic
republic “must be held accountable” for its “flagrant
violation” of U.S. and international laws.  Brent also increased more than WTI after the supervisory
committee for the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index said yesterday
that it will include Brent in the index for the first time from
January, with a weighting of one-third of the crude portion of
the index. It said it was reducing its WTI allocation.  Earlier,  New York  futures rose as much as 0.9 percent as
the euro surged to a three-week high after European Commission
President  Jose Barroso  called for a “coordinated approach” to
recapitalize the region’s banks and Slovakia’s political parties
reached an agreement to approve Europe’s enhanced bailout fund.  Slovakia is the only country in the 17-member euro area yet
to approve the European Financial Stability Facility. Lawmakers
rejected the measure yesterday amid a dispute over the future of
Prime Minister  Iveta Radicova .  Euro Surges  The euro gained 1.1 percent to $1.3789 at 4:42 p.m. in New
York. Earlier, it touched $1.3834, the highest intraday level
since Sept. 16.  “There’s relief about the risk in the EU,” said Thorbjorn Bak Jensen, an analyst at Global Risk Management in Middelfart,
 Denmark .  Oil prices  also rebounded from the day’s lows because of a
rally in the equity markets. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
gained 1 percent to 1,207.25, and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  increased 0.9 percent to 11,518.85.  “The crude oil market doesn’t really have much to trade on
other than following the stock market around like a puppy dog,”
said  Stephen Schork , president of Schork Group Inc., an energy
advisory company in Villanova, Pennsylvania.  U.S. Forecast  The U.S. Energy Department cut its crude-oil price
projection for 2011 after futures prices in New York tumbled in
September by the most since May 2010. WTI oil will average
$92.36 a barrel this year, down 2.2 percent from the September
projection of $94.40, the department said today in its monthly
 Short-Term Energy Outlook . Prices have averaged $94.92 a barrel
so far this year.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 580,034
contracts as of 4:34 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 810,036
contracts yesterday, 21 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.42 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
