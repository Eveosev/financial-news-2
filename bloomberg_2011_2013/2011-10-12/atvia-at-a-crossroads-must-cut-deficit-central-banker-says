Latvia is at a crossroads and must
cut its deficit further amid economic turmoil in  Europe  and
plans for euro adoption in 2014, the country’s central bank
governor said.  “At the moment Latvia is at a crossroads,” Governor
Ilmars Rimsevics said in a speech in Riga today. The country
should target a deficit next year of 2 percent of gross domestic
product and find measures equal to at least 150 million lati
($290 million) in next year’s budget, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
