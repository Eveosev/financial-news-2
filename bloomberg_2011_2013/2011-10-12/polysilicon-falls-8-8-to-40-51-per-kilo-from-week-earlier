The average price of polysilicon,
the raw material for solar modules, fell 8.8 percent to $40.51 a
kilogram from last week because of “less than ideal” demand,
Taipei-based EnergyTrend said today.  Solar modules fell 1.3 percent to $1.08 per watt,
EnergyTrend said in an e-mailed statement. Solar cells slipped
2.3 percent to 67 cents a watt, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
