Crude oil inventories declined 3.81
million barrels to 340.4 million last week, the  American
Petroleum Institute  said.  Gasoline stockpiles fell 1.19 million barrels to 211.2
million, the report showed.  Inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , rose 460,000
barrels to 30.5 million.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report tomorrow at 11 a.m. in  Washington . Both the API and DOE
reports are delayed by a day because of the U.S. Columbus Day
holiday on Oct. 10.  The government report may show stockpiles of crude oil rose
800,000 barrels last week, according to the median of 15
responses in a Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline inventories
probably gained 250,000 barrels, the survey showed.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil  for November delivery fell 82 cents, or 1
percent, to $84.99 at 4:31 p.m. in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. The contract, which settled at $85.57,
traded at $84.83 before the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
