Intercell AG (ICLL)  said the European
Medicines Agency gave the company positive scientific advice on
a planned trial of its experimental vaccine for Pseudomonas
aeruginosa.  The Vienna-based company obtained confirmation for the
studyâ€™s design, size, population and main goal, Intercell said
today in a statement. The trial follows a mid-stage study in
which the vaccine cut mortality in intensive care patients on
ventilators.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
