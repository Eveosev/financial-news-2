European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said the prospect for inflation
isn’t as worrying as the euro-region’s growth outlook, Market
News International reported.  “One need not have any fear of inflation,” Nowotny told a
group of financial managers in Vienna last night, according to
MNI. “What one must fear is the real economy. There is the risk
that we will enter a relatively long phase of weaker growth. The
dynamic of exports is dwindling and at the same time we see weak
domestic demand because of the consolidation of public
finances.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
