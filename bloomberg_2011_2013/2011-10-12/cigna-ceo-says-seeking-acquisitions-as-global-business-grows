Cigna Corp. (CI) , the world’s largest
provider of employer-purchased medical insurance for
expatriates, is “perpetually” looking at acquiring companies
and has the capability to make purchases of more than $1
billion, chief executive David Cordani said.  Cigna’s capital position and profit growth of 19 percent a
year allow the company to be “opportunistic with
acquisitions,” Cordani said at a meeting with reporters in
Istanbul today. The company received a license to operate in
 Turkey  in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
