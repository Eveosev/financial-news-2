Irish Finance Minister  Michael
Noonan  said he expects recent interest rate increases are going
to “go out of the system.”  “While there was an increase in the interest rate of half
a percent, that’s going to go out of the system shortly,” he
said in an interview on Dublin-based broadcaster RTE. “We are
expecting a reduction now of three quarters of one percent.”  Noonan’s comments are based on what financial markets are
pricing in for interest rate movements and he has no insights
into how the  European Central Bank  will act, a spokesman for the
minister said in a telephone interview.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
