The U.S. is unprepared for a large-
scale biological attack, according to a bipartisan report that
gave failing grades to federal, state and local governments.  Governments received the letter grade F for their ability
to diagnose large-scale attacks with drug-resistant and
contagious pathogens, according to a report today by the WMD
Center, a nonprofit group in Washington that seeks to improve
preparedness. The group also said governments aren’t prepared to
determine who is responsible for attacks.  “A thinking enemy, armed with biological weapons, could
change the very nature of America, our economy, our government,
and even our social structure,” said former Senator  Bob Graham ,
a Florida Democrat and the center’s chairman, in a statement.
“America does not yet have adequate bio-response capability to
meet fundamental expectations during a large-scale biological
event.”  The center took over the work of Congress’s Commission on
the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and
Terrorism. That panel, in a January 2010  report , gave the
federal government an F grade for biological-attack response.  The center in the report released today gave the grade C
for federal, state and local officials’ ability to detect small-
scale attacks and the grade B for their preparation to treat
victims of those incidents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
