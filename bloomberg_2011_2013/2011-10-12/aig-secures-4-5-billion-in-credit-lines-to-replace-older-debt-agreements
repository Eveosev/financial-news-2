American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer majority owned by the U.S. government, obtained $4.5
billion in credit facilities to replace old debt agreements.  AIG entered into a $3 billion four-year credit pact and a
$1.5 billion 364-day facility, the New York-based company said
today in a statement distributed by  Business Wire .  The accords replace $3.18 billion of AIG credit facilities
and a $1.3 billion 364-day letter of credit for property-
casualty unit Chartis, which were arranged in December 2010,
according to the statement. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup
Inc. arranged the bank lines.  “These new credit facilities provide AIG and our
subsidiaries with financial flexibility on more favorable
terms,” David Herzog, AIG’s chief financial officer, said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
