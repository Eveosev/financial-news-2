Irish Finance Minister  Michael
Noonan  will examine the issue of mortgage interest relief for
home owners in the upcoming budget.  Ireland will stick to its 8.6 percent debt-to-gross
domestic product target for 2012, Noonan said in an interview
with Dublin-based RTE television today. This may require more
than 3.6 billion euros of budget cuts next year.  The government said in March as it came to power it will
examine increasing mortgage interest relief to 30 percent for
first-time buyers who bought houses between 2004 and 2008 from a
current sliding scale of 20-25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
