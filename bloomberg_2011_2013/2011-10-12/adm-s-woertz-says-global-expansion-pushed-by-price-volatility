Volatile commodity prices are
spurring Archer Daniels Midland Co. to diversify its sources of
food and processing, Chief Executive Officer Patricia Woertz
said.  “It’s important to fill out our global footprint” by
growing in  Africa ,  South Asia  and other regions where more food
is needed to meet  population growth , Woertz said today in an
interview at the World Food Prize conference in Des Moines,
 Iowa . “Volatility is here to stay,” said Woertz, the head of
the Decatur, Illinois-based company since 2006.  Corn, the biggest U.S. crop, fell to $5.7225 a bushel last
week from a record $7.9975 in June as adverse weather and swings
in the global economy changed forecasts for supply and demand.
Wheat has ranged from $5.92 a bushel to $9.1675 this year, and
soybeans have traded from $11.52 to $14.65.  Cargill Inc., the grain distributor that is the largest
closely held company in the U.S., said on Oct. 10 that fiscal
first-quarter profit from continuing operations fell 66 percent
because of volatility in commodity markets.  The World Food Prize conference is held annually to honor
individuals “who have advanced human development by improving
the quality, quantity or availability of food.” It also fosters
discussion among agribusinesses, governments and nonprofit
organizations on how best to feed a global population expected
to top 9 billion by 2050, up from almost 7 billion this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
