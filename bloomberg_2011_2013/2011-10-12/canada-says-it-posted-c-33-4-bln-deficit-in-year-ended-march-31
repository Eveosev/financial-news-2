Canada’s budget deficit was a
smaller-than-forecast C$33.4 billion ($32.9 billion) in the year
ended March 31, Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said, adding he
may increase stimulus if the global recovery falters.  The figure for the last fiscal year was C$2.8 billion less
than predicted in the June budget because revenue was higher
than expected while spending was lower, according the finance
department’s annual  report  posted on its website today. About
half of the deficit came from stimulus programs that the
government has wound down, the report said.  “We will continue to carefully monitor the economy and
will remain flexible and pragmatic in responding to any material
deterioration in global economic conditions,” Flaherty said in
a summary of the annual report posted on the department’s
website today. “We are exercising fiscal responsibility and we
are urging other countries around the world to demonstrate the
same discipline.”  Flaherty has said the government plans to balance the
budget by the year beginning April 2014 through government
spending cuts of up to C$4 billion annually and closing tax
loopholes. Canada projects a deficit of C$32.3 billion this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
