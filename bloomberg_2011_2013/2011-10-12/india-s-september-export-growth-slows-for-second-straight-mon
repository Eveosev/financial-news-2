India ’s merchandise export growth
slowed for a second straight month in September, the top
bureaucrat in the nation’s commerce ministry said.  Merchandise shipments rose 36.3 percent to $24.8 billion
from a year earlier, Commerce Secretary  Rahul Khullar  said in
New Delhi today. Exports gained 44.25 percent in August.  Asian nations such as  Indonesia  and the  Philippines  have
stepped up efforts to shield their economies as  Europe ’s debt
crisis and a faltering recovery in the U.S. curb overseas
demand. India’s export target of $300 billion by the end of
March is “credible,” Kullar told reporters today.  India’s imports rose 17.2 percent to $34.6 billion in
September, Khullar said. The trade deficit was $9.8 billion last
month, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
