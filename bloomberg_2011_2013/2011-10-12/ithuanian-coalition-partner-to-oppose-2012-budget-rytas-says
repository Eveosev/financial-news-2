The Liberal and Center Union, a
junior member of  Lithuania ’s three-party coalition, will vote
against the 2012 budget plan today,  Lietuvos Rytas  reported ,
citing Transport Minister Raimundas Palaitis.  Palaitis said the state budget is based on “ungrounded
fears about the financial markets and lacks social balance,”
Lietuvos Rytas quoted him as saying.  The Baltic nation’s government aims to cut the  budget
deficit  to 2.8 percent of gross domestic product next year by
cutting financing for ministries and raising more revenue from
state-owned companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
