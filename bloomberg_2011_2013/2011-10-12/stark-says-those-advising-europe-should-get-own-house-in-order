European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said those giving advice to  Europe  on
how to solve the debt crisis “should get their own house in
order” first.  “We get a lot of advice, in particular from the other side
of the Atlantic,” Stark said during a speech in Riga today.
“All those who give advice to the Europeans should get their
own house in order. Only then is it justified.”  Europe is “not to be compared with a fully fledged
federation and it takes more time to come to decisions,” Stark
said. “This is not necessarily a weakness.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
