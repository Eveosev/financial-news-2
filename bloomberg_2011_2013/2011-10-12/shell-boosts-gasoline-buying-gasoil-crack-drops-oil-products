Royal Dutch Shell Plc extended its
gasoline-cargo purchases in  Singapore , where the company is
resuming some operations at the Pulau Bukom refinery after a
Sept. 28 fire. Gasoil’s crack spread narrowed.  Light Distillates  Shell bought two 50,000-barrel cargoes of gasoline in
Singapore, bringing its purchases since Sept. 29 to at least
700,000 barrels, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders
monitoring transactions on the Platts window. The company paid
$130 a barrel to Total SA for a 97-RON cargo and $125.30 a
barrel to Vitol Group for 95-RON grade.  Vitol bought two similar-sized 92-RON cargoes, paying
$123.50 a barrel to PetroChina Co. and Morgan Stanley, the
survey showed. Shell also purchased a 25,000 metric-ton open-
specification naphtha contract for first-half December for a
third day, paying Vitol $906 a ton.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha fell $2 to $24.80 a barrel,
declining from the highest since May 6, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. This reforming margin widened in the
previous nine days, signaling motor fuel was more profitable to
produce.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures rose
$25.47 to $63.36 a ton at 5:55 p.m. Singapore time, according to
Bloomberg data. This crack spread, a measure of refining profit,
rebounded from the lowest since May 2009.  Middle Distillates  Shell sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5
percent sulfur to Glencore International AG in Singapore,
according to the Bloomberg survey.  Europe ’s largest oil company
received 50 cents a barrel over benchmark quotes, an increased
premium from 30 cents in a transaction yesterday. The cargo is
for Oct. 27 to Oct. 31, the earliest loading period.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude slid 67 cents
to $15.30 a barrel at 6:18 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread was
the narrowest since Sept. 15.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil decreased 25 cents to $2.40 a
barrel, PVM said. This regrade is the lowest so far this month,
indicating it is becoming less profitable to produce  aviation
fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  Hin Leong Trading Pte bought two 20,000-ton cargoes of 380-
centistoke  fuel oil  in Singapore, according to the Bloomberg
survey. The closely held trader paid $8.50 a barrel over October
quotes to Vitol and Lukoil OAO to load between Oct. 27 and Oct.
31.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 74 cents to
$3.49 a barrel at 6:18 p.m. Singapore time, based on PVM data.
That’s the smallest gap in four days, signaling reduced losses
for refiners turning crude into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade gained 50 cents to $8.25 a ton, the highest since Sept. 26,
PVM said. A widening viscosity spread means higher-quality fuel
oil has climbed less than bunker, or marine fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
