President Giorgio Napolitano said
Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  must spell out how he intends
to get  Italy ’s 2010 budget approved when he addresses Parliament
tomorrow.  “It will then be up to the speakers of the two houses” of
Parliament “to decide on the sustainability” of Berlusconi’s
suggested solution to the legislative impasse, Napolitano said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Berlusconi’s government failed to muster a majority in the
lower house yesterday in a vote to rubberstamp the 2010 budget,
raising doubts about the strength of his parliamentary majority.
Opposition leaders have called on him to resign and he may call
a confidence vote during his address to the Chamber of Deputies
tomorrow at 11 a.m.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
