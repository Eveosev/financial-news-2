Two  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  client
advisers were charged yesterday with helping U.S. customers of
the Zurich-based bank evade taxes, according to an indictment
and a person with knowledge of the matter.  Daniela Casadei and Fabio Frazzetto conspired with more
than 180 U.S. clients and others at the bank to hide at least
$600 million in assets from the Internal Revenue Service,
according to the indictment in federal court in New York and the
person, who wasn’t authorized to speak about the matter. The
indictment refers to the bank as Swiss Bank No. 1.  The Justice Department has said eight offshore banks are
under grand-jury investigation for facilitating tax evasion. The
U.S. crackdown has led to charges against  UBS AG (UBSN) , the largest
Swiss bank; at least 19 other bankers, advisers and attorneys;
and at least 36 U.S. taxpayers. Seventeen of those charged are
outside the U.S. and haven’t responded in court to the charges.  The IRS has said 30,000 U.S. taxpayers with offshore
accounts avoided prosecution since 2009 by entering a limited
amnesty program, paying back taxes and saying who helped them
hide their accounts from authorities.  The taxpayers who were criminally charged had accounts at
banks including UBS;  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s
second-largest bank; and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest
bank.  Below is a summary of the cases filed in federal courts
around the U.S.:  To contact the reporter on this story:
