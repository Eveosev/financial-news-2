South Korea ’s bank lending to
households increased the least in eight months as payment of
holiday bonuses to workers reduced the need to borrow.  Lending to households increased by 600 billion won ($511
million) last month to a record 448.7 trillion won, the Bank of
Korea said in an e-mailed statement today.  Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo has said the central
bank needs to “normalize”  interest rates  to curb record
household debt and inflation above his target. Even so, Kim and
his board will keep borrowing costs at 3.25 percent for a fourth
straight month tomorrow amid concern a global slowdown will damp
the nation’s growth, according to all 15 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Mortgage lending rose 1.1 trillion won to 299.7 trillion
won, today’s report showed. Loans to companies advanced 4.8
trillion won to 553.6 trillion won.  The broadest measure of  money supply , M2, gained 4 percent
in August from a year earlier after rising 3.2 percent in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
