BAE Systems Plc (BA/) , Europe’s largest
defense company, said markets remain challenging as the U.S. and
other nations consider cuts to defense budgets.  Sales so far this year are in line with management
predictions and the company reiterated full-year underlying
earnings per share will be broadly similar to 2010’s result,
according to a statement from BAE today.  BAE, based in  London , is reviewing operations globally as
U.S. and European governments seek ways to reduce spending. BAE
said Sept. 27 it will cut about 3,000 jobs across sites in the
U.K. to trim costs and slow production of Eurofighter planes.  Hurricane damage to BAE’s Johnson City electronics facility
may result in some sales being deferred to 2012, the company
said. The flooding is not expected to impact full-year earnings
materially, it added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
