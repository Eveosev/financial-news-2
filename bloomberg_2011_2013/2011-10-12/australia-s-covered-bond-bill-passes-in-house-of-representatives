Australia ’s lower house passed
legislation today allowing the nation’s financial companies to
sell covered bonds, a move the Treasury estimates may lead to
A$130 billion ($129 billion) of sales.  The legislation, introduced to parliament last month by
Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan, will amend the nation’s  Banking
Act  to allow domestic lenders to sell the debt for the first
time. It now depends on a vote in the upper house Senate to
become law.  “This represents an important new source of funding for
our financial system, particularly while global capital markets
are so volatile,” Swan’s office said today in an e-mailed
statement confirming the  House of Representatives  vote.  While offshore banks have been allowed to sell covered
notes in Australia, the ban meant domestic lenders were unable
to access cheaper funding in a nation with the highest  interest
rates  in the developed world. Covered bonds, which typically
have the highest credit rating, are backed by assets that stay
on the bank’s balance sheet and can be sold in a default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
