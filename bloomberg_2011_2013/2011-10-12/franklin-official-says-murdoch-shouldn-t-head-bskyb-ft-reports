James Murdoch  should step down as
chairman of  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) , according to
Peter Langerman, who heads Mutual Series, an investment team
within Franklin Templeton Investments, a leading BSkyB
shareholder, the Financial Times reported.  Murdoch is deputy chief operating officer of  News Corp .,
the Murdoch-controlled media company that owns 39.1 percent of
BSkyB and that abandoned a bid for full control because of the
phone-hacking scandal, the newspaper said.  While Mutual Series recognizes Murdoch’s “track record,”
it thinks “an independent chairman would be advisable,” the FT
cited Langerman as saying.  He didn’t express a view on whether Murdoch should leave
BSkyB’s board altogether, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
