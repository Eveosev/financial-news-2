Tanzania’s shilling depreciated for
the first day in three as companies increased dollar demand.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy lost
as much as 0.9 percent to 1,715 per dollar, and traded down 0.2
percent at 1,704 by 12:37 p.m. in Dar es Salaam, the commercial
capital.  “The foods and beverages sector has been buying dollars
today,” Eric Chijoriga, a trader with National Bank of Commerce
Ltd., Absa Group Ltd.’s Tanzanian unit, said by phone from Dar
es Salaam. “We have also seen oil importers’ demand for dollars
pick up slightly. It is mainly the tourism sector that is
supplying the dollar today, as they pick up shillings.”  Tanzania’s inflation rate climbed to 14.1 percent in
August, on higher energy and food costs, the National Bureau of
Statistics said Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
