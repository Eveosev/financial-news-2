Florida’s orange crop will be 4.8
percent larger than last season, exceeding estimates by
analysts, as favorable weather aided crops, the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said.  The state, the world’s second-biggest orange grower, will
produce 147 million boxes in the harvest that is just getting
under way, up from a 140.3 million in the previous season, the
USDA said today in its first  estimate  for the new crop. The
average forecast of seven analysts and traders in a Bloomberg
News survey was 144.5 million boxes. A box weighs 90 pounds, or
41 kilograms.  “We’ve had good rain over the summer and a large bloom in
the spring, so this is pretty close to what we expected,”
Michael W. Sparks, the chief executive officer of Florida Citrus
Mutual in Lakeland, Florida, said in a statement.  The group is the state’s largest organization of citrus
growers.  Brazil  is the leading orange producer.  Orange juice  for November delivery rose 1.2 percent to
$1.634 a pound at 1:29 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Before today, the commodity tumbled 20 percent from a four-year
high of $2.0265 on July 19.  Florida’s yields will average 1.6 gallons per box, up from
1.59 gallons a year earlier, the USDA said. The state’s harvest
runs into July.  “The weather has been good for the crop,” Fain Shaffer,
the president of Infinity Trading Corp. in Medford,  Oregon , said
in a telephone interview before the report. “They got plenty of
rain, which helped the fruit size, and overall yields will be
better.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
