French Prime Minister  Francois
Fillon  is seeking to increase the countryâ€™s supplementary tax on
high earners,  Les Echos  reported, without citing anyone.  The extra tax will be increased to 3 percent for households
with individuals earning 250,000 euros a year each, and 4
percent for households where the individuals earn at least
500,000 euros each, the newspaper said.  The change will double projected state receipts from the
extra tax to slightly over 400 million euros, the newspaper
said. The finance commission is likely to approve the proposal
today, Les Echos said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
