India ’s rupee rebounded from a one-
week low after the nation’s second-largest software exporter
reported profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  The currency rose for the fourth time in five days as the
BSE India Sensitive Index gained 1.2 percent. Infosys Ltd. said
net income was 19.1 billion rupees ($387 million) last quarter,
compared with a median forecast of 35 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey for 18.7 billion rupees. The rupee fell earlier on
concern  Europe ’s debt problems will damp demand for emerging-
market assets.  “On one hand, we have news such as that from Infosys which
suggests exports and the economy may not perform as badly as
some believe, and on the other, the European problems are not
yet gone,” said Krishnamurthy Harihar, treasurer at FirstRand
Ltd. in Mumbai. “The rupee will likely stay in a range until we
have stronger cues.”  The rupee strengthened 0.2 percent to 49.2325 per dollar as
of 11:01 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It dropped to 49.4750 earlier, the weakest level
since Oct. 5. FirstRand’s Harihar expects the currency to trade
between 49.00 and 49.50 in the coming weeks.  Slovakia’s parliament failed to ratify changes to a bailout
fund for the euro region in a vote yesterday. European officials
are striving to meet an end-of-month target set by French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  to get to grips with a crisis that’s
propelled  Greece  to the brink of default and shaken global
financial markets.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 49.87 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations for a
rate of 49.97 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
