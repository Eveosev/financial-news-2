Chile’s President Sebastian Pinera
plans to make last year’s increase in the corporate taxes to 20
percent from 17 percent permanent, raising an estimated $450
million in annual revenue, El Mercurio reported.  The  Finance Ministry , which temporarily raised corporate
taxes to fund reconstruction after the February 2010 earthquake,
is studying the changes, the Santiago-based newspaper reported
today, citing government and congressional officials that it
didn’t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
