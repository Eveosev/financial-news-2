WestLB AG’s potential sale of its
real-estate unit, Westdeutsche ImmobilienBank AG, to Apollo
Global Management LLC has been delayed because of the complexity
of the transaction, the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported
today, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.  The bank won’t make a decision on the sale to Apollo until
next month, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
