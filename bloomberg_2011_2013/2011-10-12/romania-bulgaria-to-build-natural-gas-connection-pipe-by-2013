Romania  and  Bulgaria  plan to
complete the construction of a 23.8 million-euro ($33 million)
natural-gas pipeline to connect their two national grids by
2013.  The 25-kilometer (15.5 miles) link with planned capacity of
1.5 billion cubic meters will help Bulgaria diversify gas
sources, as it now fully relies on Russian natural gas imports,
Bulgaria’s Economy and Energy Ministry in Sofia said in an e-
mail today.  Bulgartransgaz AD, the state-run company that operates the
national grid, opened a tender to commission a feasibility study
for the 15.4-kilometer Bulgarian section of the pipeline,
according to the ministry. Romania’s natural-gas grid operator
Transgaz SA is currently evaluating design and construction bids
for the 2.1-kilometer section under the Danube and the Romanian
section of the link, the ministry said.  The two Black Sea countries held a bilateral governments
meeting in Bucharest today to discuss regional projects. The two
countries also discussed future joint exploration of shale gas
deposits on both sides of the Danube river, the ministry said.  The European Union will contribute 9 million euros of the
connection’s total cost. Bulgaria is building similar natural
gas connections with grids in Greece and  Serbia .  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
