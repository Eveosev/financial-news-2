Bulgarian inflation slowed in
September as the domestic harvest held down food costs and
prices of leisure activities declined.  Consumer prices rose 3.3 percent from a year earlier, after
a 4.1 percent increase in August, the National Statistics
Institute in the capital, Sofia, said today in a statement. The
median estimate of three economists surveyed by Bloomberg was
3.5 percent. Prices were unchanged from the previous month.  Bulgaria â€™s currency-board system limits options for the
central bank to stem price growth through  interest rates .
Factory-gate prices slowed to an annual 6.6 percent in August,
the slowest growth in 14 months, according to Bloomberg data.  Food prices, the biggest item in the consumer basket, with
a 36.6 percent weighting, rose 0.1 percent from the preceding
month, the statistics office said. Leisure prices declined 4
percent from August as the summer holiday season wound up.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its inflation forecasts
for Bulgaria on May 20 to an average of 4.2 percent this year
and 3 percent in 2012, from 4.8 percent and 3.7 percent
respectively. The government forecasts inflation at 3.6 percent
in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
