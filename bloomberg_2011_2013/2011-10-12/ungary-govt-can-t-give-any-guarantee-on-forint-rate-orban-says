Hungary’s government can’t give any
guarantee on the exchange rate of the forint as  Europe  is faced
with at least two “very challenging” years ahead, Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban  said.  “We can not and do not want to guarantee anything with the
exchange rate of the forint, it’s shaped by external factors,”
Orban said at a press conference in Budapest today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
