Greece ’s central-government deficit
widened 15 percent in the first nine months of the year, meeting
a target in the budget.  The shortfall, which excludes outlays by state-owned
institutions and companies, rose to 19.2 billion euros ($26.5
billion) from 16.7 billion euros a year earlier, according to
preliminary figures e-mailed today by the  Finance Ministry  in
Athens. The new nine-month target was 19.2 billion euros, the
statement said.  The government’s 2012 budget draft revised this year’s
deficit target to 8.5 percent of gross domestic product. The
draft was passed at the parliament committee level this week.  “The fact that the fourth-quarter of 2011 is seasonally
soft on interest costs means that there is a good chance that we
will see the overall budget in balance or even some surplus,”
Athens-based Alpha Finance analyst Nikos Lianeris said in an e-
mail today.  Spending and revenue performance in the period was in line
with the new targets. Ordinary spending rose 7 percent from
January through September to 52.5 billion euros, the ministry
said. Net revenue decreased 4.2 percent to 35 billion euros.  The ministry blamed the revenue drop on a deeper-than-
forecast recession and an increase in tax rebates. Final
central-government data are due around Sept. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
