Doha Bank QSC (DHBK) , Qatar’s fifth-largest
lender by market value, reported a 10 percent jump in third-
quarter profit as interest income increased.  Net income rose to 308 million riyals ($85 million) from
280.6 million riyals a year earlier, according to a  financial
statement  posted on the Qatar Exchange website today. Net
interest income climbed 10 percent to 382 million riyals, while
gains from fees increased 14 percent to 93.5 million riyals.  Qatar, the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural
gas, forecasts its economy may expand by about 16 percent this
year, helped by fuel exports. Qatar National Bank SAQ, the
country’s largest lender, posted a 31 percent increase in third-
quarter profit, beating estimates.  Doha Bank’s lending grew about 9 percent so far this year
and may increase as much as 20 percent in 2012 after the
government raised wages and announced infrastructure projects
for the 2022 soccer World Cup, Chief Executive Officer  Raghavan Seetharaman  said in an interview on Sept. 23.  The shares have dropped 4.5 percent this year compared with
a 3 percent decline in the benchmark  QE Index. (DSM)  The stock closed
1.3 percent higher at 62.1 riyals in Doha trading today before
the results were announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
