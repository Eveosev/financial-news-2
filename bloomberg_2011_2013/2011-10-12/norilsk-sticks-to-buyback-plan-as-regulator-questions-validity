OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel,  Russia ’s
largest mining company, plans to press ahead with a share
buyback even after the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service said the
program may require state approval.  The buyback, which began Sept. 28, doesn’t breach the Law
on Foreign Investment, Norilsk said today in a  website  statement
after receiving a letter from the antitrust agency. The
regulator hasn’t banned the company from accepting offers from
shareholders tendering their stock, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
