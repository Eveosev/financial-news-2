German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said that  Europe  won’t take the “easy way” of
“cheap money” to deal with its crisis.  “It has to be clear that we won’t go the easy way of using
the printing press or betting on inflation,” Schaeuble said
today in remarks in Berlin. “We mustn’t go down the path of
cheap money.”  “We can study on the other side of the Atlantic that
another way -- even with a totally different economic dynamism -
- has obviously reached its limits,” he said.  “It is not a pure coincidence that  Lehman Brothers  had its
origins in the U.S. with the subprime crisis. Behind that was
the political attempt to solve important tasks of social policy
-- wider wealth distribution, integration of the socially-
underprivileged -- by means of monetary policy. This is a
dangerous attempt. We can’t evade the difficult political
processes by taking the monetary policy short-cut,” said
Schaeuble.  To contact the reporter on this story:
