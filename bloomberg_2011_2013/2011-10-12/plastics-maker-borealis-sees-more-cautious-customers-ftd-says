Borealis AG, a maker of plastics and
chemicals for the infrastructure and auto industries, sees its
customers becoming “more cautious” because of the European
debt crisis,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing an
interview with Chief Executive Officer Mark Garrett.  Business in  Europe  has slowed compared with the first half
as customers reduce inventories, the newspaper said. Still,
Borealis is targeting record sales of more than 7 billion euros
($9.6 billion) this year, boosted by  Asia , FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
