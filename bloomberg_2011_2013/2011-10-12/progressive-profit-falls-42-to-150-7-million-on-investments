Progressive Corp. (PGR) , the fourth-
largest U.S. auto insurer, said profit fell 42 percent on
declines in the value of investments and weaker underwriting
results as  Hurricane Irene  struck the East Coast.  Third-quarter net income dropped to $150.7 million, or 24
cents a share, from $261.6 million, or 40 cents, in the year-
earlier period, the Mayfield Village, Ohio-based company said
today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer Glenn Renwick, 56, said the company
needs to limit writedowns to maximize the funds available to
back the sale of new insurance policies. He has reduced the
allocation to preferred stocks, which he said could become hard
to sell at a time of market disruption.  “We’re trying to avoid some of the risks that are front
and center right now, and leaving us with more flexibility,”
William Cody, chief investment officer for Progressive, said in
a conference call Aug. 11.  The insurer had a net realized loss on securities of $52.6
million, compared with a gain of $26.9 million in last year’s
second quarter. Book value, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, fell to $9.37 a share from $9.88 on June 30. The
value of the company’s equity portfolio, including preferred and
common stocks, fell to $2.47 billion as of Sept. 30 from $2.9
billion three months earlier.  Industrywide Slump  Progressive fell 5 cents to $18.33 at 9:53 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The insurer slipped 7.5
percent this year through yesterday, compared with the 22
percent drop in the 24-company  KBW Insurance Index. (KIX)   Progressive had an underwriting profit margin of 4.8 cents
on every dollar in premiums for the quarter, compared with 7.1
cents a year earlier. The insurer had previously said that
catastrophe losses in August, led by Irene claims, jumped to $37
million, or 3.2 cents per premium dollar, from about $2.2
million in the year-earlier period. Progressive reports results
monthly.  Property insurers including State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Co. and  Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the largest U.S. auto
insurers, have been pressured by catastrophes including second-
quarter tornadoes and Irene. The storm lashed the U.S. from
 North Carolina  to  New England , where flooding may have fueled
car-damage claims, said  Mark Dwelle , an analyst at  RBC Capital
Markets , who rates Progressive as “outperform.”  “People were encouraged to stay put more than evacuate”
in New England states, leaving their vehicles vulnerable to
floods, he said.  Sales Gain  Policy sales advanced 4.2 percent to $3.87 billion.
Progressive’s total personal auto insurance policies
climbed to 8.41 million from 8.38 million on June 30, led by
gains in clients who purchased their policies through the
Internet or phone.  Operating income, which excludes some investment results,
was about 29 cents a share, beating by 1 cent the average
estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Miles traveled in July on U.S. roads fell to the lowest
for the period since 2002, as  gas prices  above $3 per gallon and
unemployment at 9.1 percent limited the number of trips,
according to the most recent monthly  report  from the Federal
Highway Commission. Fewer miles driven may result in a lower
frequency of collision claims for auto insurers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
