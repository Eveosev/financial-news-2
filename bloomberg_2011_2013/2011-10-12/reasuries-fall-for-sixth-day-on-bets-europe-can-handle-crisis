U.S. 30-year bonds fell for a sixth
day in the longest losing streak in four years as speculation
 Europe ’s leaders will be able to contain the region’s sovereign-
debt crisis reduced the refuge appeal of the securities.  Treasury 10-year yields climbed to a six-week high before
the U.S. sells $21 billion of the debt. Thirty-year yields were
at almost the highest in three weeks as European Commission
President  Jose Barroso  called for a reinforcement of crisis-hit
banks and a faster start for a permanent rescue fund. Investors
bet for the first time in three weeks that Treasury notes will
decline, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. customer survey showed.  “Yields are rising ahead of new supply and as more
positive sentiment about Europe and global growth enter the
market,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader at Societe Generale SA in
New York, one of the 22 primary dealers that trade with the
 Federal Reserve . “The concessions in prices that we are seeing
should help the auctions go better as people will look to come
in at cheaper levels.”  Thirty-year yields climbed 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 3.20 percent at 12:34 p.m. in New York, the
highest level since Sept. 21. The yield hasn’t risen for six
days since the period through May 18, 2007. The 3.75 percent
bond due in August 2041 fell 1 31/32, or $19.69 per $1,000 face
amount, to 110 5/8.  The 10-year yield increased eight basis points to 2.22
percent and touched 2.23 percent, the highest since Sept. 1.  Thirty-year yields have advanced 25 basis points since Oct.
6, the day before a Labor Department report showed U.S. payrolls
added 103,000 jobs in September, more than economists predicted.  Yield Outlook  Economists in Bloomberg surveys taken from Oct. 5 to
yesterday raised year-end forecasts for two-year note yields and
lowered projections for 10- and 30-year yields. Two-year notes
will yield 0.25 percent on Dec. 31, according to the median
estimate, compared with the previous forecast of 0.2 percent.
Ten-year notes will yield 2.1 percent, versus an earlier
projection of 2.22 percent, and 30-year bonds will yield 3.25
percent, versus 3.6 percent.  The Fed is due to release at 2 p.m. minutes of its last
meeting. Policy makers at the Sept. 20-21 session said the
central bank will buy $400 billion of bonds with maturities of
six to 30 years through June while selling an equal amount of
debt maturing in three years or less.  It sold $8.87 billion today of Treasuries maturing in two
years or less as part of the program. The securities were due
from March 2013 to October 2013.  Treasury Auction  The Treasury 10-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded
a record low 2 percent the last time they auctioned on Sept. 13.  “The auction today will be interesting and will give us
insight into whether domestic and foreign investors see these
levels as attractive given the backup, or if they are going to
put up their hands and see how far the risk rally runs,” said
 John Briggs , a U.S. government bond strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc’s RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , a primary dealer.  Investors at last month’s 10-year offering bid for 3.03
times the amount of available debt, versus the average of 3.16
for the past 10 sales. Indirect bidders, a category that
includes foreign central banks, bought 48.5 percent of the
securities, versus the 10-auction average of 48.8 percent.  The government will sell $13 billion of 30-year bonds
tomorrow. It auctioned $32 billion of three-year debt yesterday.  Barroso, speaking to the European Parliament in Brussels,
called for the payout of a sixth loan to  Greece . He urged a
“coordinated approach” to deliver a “significantly higher
capital ratio of highest quality capital” for banks, while
offering government funds only as a last resort. Banks that
require aid would be barred from paying dividends or bonuses.  ‘Affordable Rates’  “The most important problem is they have to make sure that
the major economies of Europe that are under pressure now are
able to borrow at affordable rates,” Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said yesterday in an interview with Bloomberg
Television. “They recognize the need to do more than they’ve
done so far.”  Treasuries returned 6.4 percent in the third quarter, the
most since the  U.S. economy  was in a recession in the final
three months of 2008, amid demand for the safety of  U.S. debt , a
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index shows. They declined 1
percent this month.  The percent of net shorts on Treasury notes in JPMorgan’s
“all clients” survey, or bets that the price of the securities
will fall, rose to 2 percent for the week ending Oct. 11. That
compared with a net long position, or bets prices will rise, of
11 percent the prior week. About 85 percent of the clients
surveyed remained neutral.  The difference between yields on U.S. 10-year notes and
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt, widened to as
much as 2.05 percentage points yesterday, the most in a month,
signaling investors are increasing wagers that consumer-price
increases will accelerate as the economy recovers. The gap was
1.98 percentage points today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
