AS Tallinna Vesi (TVEAT) ,  Estonia ’s biggest
water utility, fell to the lowest level since it started trading
in June 2005 after saying the country’s competition regulator
may cut its prices by almost a third.  The stock fell as much as 6.8 percent in Tallinn, the
steepest decline since June 6, and traded 4.5 percent lower at
6.79 euros at 11:18 a.m. local time. The shares have declined
4.2 percent this year compared with a 21 percent average decline
for the company’s Eastern European utilities peers, according to
Bloomberg data.  Tallinna Vesi, which supplies the Tallinn area, said
regulators may unilaterally impose a 29 percent cut in the
pricing mechanism if the company doesn’t apply by Nov. 14 to
reduce its prices. Tallinna Vesi will seek a court injunction to
block the move because it “completely” disagrees with the
watchdog’s position, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
