Singaporeâ€™s government said it will
implement an energy conservation act for industries in 2013 that
will require large users to formulate efficiency improvement
plans.  The users must also appoint energy managers and submit
energy consumption data, the government said in a statement
elaborating on plans laid out by President Tony Tan in
parliament earlier this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
