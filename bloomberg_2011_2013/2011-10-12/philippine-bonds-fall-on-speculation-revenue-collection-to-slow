Philippine 10-years bonds fell,
halting five days of gains, on speculation revenue collection
will slow after the government cut its growth forecast for the
economy. The peso gained, erasing earlier losses.  Gross domestic product will increase 4.5 percent to 5.5
percent this year, down from a previous estimate of 5 percent to
6 percent, Economic Planning Secretary Cayetano Paderanga said
in  Manila  today. The peso fell as much as 0.5 percent earlier in
the day after official data showed yesterday exports dropped in
August by the most since September 2009.  “If growth slows, so will tax collections,” said Radhika
Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore . “That’s why
bond yields went up.”  The yield on the 6.5 percent notes due April 2021 increased
four basis points to 5.93 percent, according to noon fixing
prices at the Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.  The peso advanced as central bank Governor Amando Tetangco
said today the Asian nation has sufficient liquidity, a stable
 exchange rate  and a “manageable” inflation outlook along with
“fiscal space” to help support economic growth. The economy
will expand between 5 percent and 6 percent in 2012, Paderanga
said.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 43.405 per dollar in Manila,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It reached 44.215 on Oct. 4,
the lowest level since Feb. 1.  Philippine exports declined 15.1 percent in August from a
year earlier after falling 1.7 percent in July, the  National
Statistics Office  said yesterday. President Benign Aquino said
today the global slowdown has become a “formidable” problem as
he announced 72 billion pesos ($1.6 billion) of extra spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
