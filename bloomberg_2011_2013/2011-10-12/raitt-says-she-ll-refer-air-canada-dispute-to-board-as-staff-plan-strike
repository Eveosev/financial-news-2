Canada ’s labor minister reiterated
she will refer a dispute at  Air Canada (AC/A)  to the country’s labor
relations board today, a move she has said would prevent a
strike from starting at midnight Toronto time.  “Given our fragile economy, a work stoppage is
unacceptable,” said a message e-mailed by Lisa Raitt’s
spokeswoman Jana Regimbal. “The government has considered all
its options and we will be referring this labour dispute to the
CIRB today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
