Stima Sacco Ltd. ,  Kenya ’s fourth-
biggest credit union, said it received 43 percent more bids than
the 500 million shillings ($5 million) worth of stock on offer
in a sale to existing shareholders.  The credit cooperative, which sold 5 million shares at 100
shillings each between July 11 and Sept. 9, received
applications worth 713 million shillings, Chairman Joseph Njoroge told reporters in the capital, Nairobi.  “We are the first sacco to have mobilized funds from our
members in terms of shares,” said Njoroge, who is also the
managing director of Kenya Power Ltd., the country’s sole
electricity distributor. The credit union currently has no plans
to list on the stock exchange, he said  Savings and credit cooperatives, known as saccos, account
for about one-third of savings in  East Africa ’s biggest economy.
Deposit-taking saccos had 171.3 billion shillings of assets at
the end of 2010, while another 3,756 cooperatives that don’t
collect deposits had assets of 39 billion shillings, according
to the  Sacco Societies Regulatory Authority .  Savings held by the saccos have risen at an average pace of
20 percent annually over the past five years, the authority said
in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
