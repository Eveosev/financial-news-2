Blackstone Group LP (BX)  may become the
controlling shareholder in Miller Group, the U.K.’s largest
closely held construction company, Sky News’s Mark Kleinman
said, without saying where he got the information.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ,
which already owns 20 percent of Edinburgh-based Miller, and
possibly Clydesdale Bank, a unit of  National Australia Bank
Ltd. (NAB) , may end up owning as much as 30 percent of Miller under a
debt-for-equity swap, Sky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
