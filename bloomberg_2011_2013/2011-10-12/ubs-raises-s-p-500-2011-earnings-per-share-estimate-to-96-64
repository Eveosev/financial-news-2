UBS AG (UBSN)  raised its 2011 earnings
forecast for companies in the the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
citing stronger-than-forecast U.S. economic data.  Thomas Doerflinger, a New York-based strategist for
 Switzerland ’s biggest bank, raised his profit estimate for the
benchmark U.S. equity index to $96.64 a share from $95, saying
earnings in the second half of the year will reflect higher
economic growth expectations after U.S. manufacturing, auto
sales, construction and payrolls data beat forecasts.  “Profits are weakening but are stronger than investors,
ourselves included, feared,” Doerflinger wrote in a note dated
today. A September UBS report showed “results of ‘early
reporters’ indicated that third-quarter profits were soft but
were not collapsing,” he wrote.  Concern European officials will fail to contain the
region’s sovereign debt crisis and the global economy will slip
back into a recession has spurred analysts who cover stocks in
the  S&P 500  to cut their profit forecasts for the year. The
average estimate for 2011 earnings has fallen 0.3 percent to
$100.03 from its high on Sept. 1. Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S.
aluminum producer, reported earnings yesterday that trailed
estimates, becoming the first company in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  to report quarterly results.  The S&P 500 has fallen as much as 19 percent from its high
in April. The benchmark measure for American equities rose 1.2
percent to 1,210.12 at 10:17 a.m. New York time.  Weaker ‘Tone’  While Doerflinger raised his third-quarter earnings-per
share-estimate to $24.50 from $23.50 and for the fourth quarter
to $24.50 from $23.84, he also noted the “tone” of the current
earnings reporting season may be much weaker than in the past
six quarters.  “The weakening global economy and risk of major negative
surprises from Wall Street firms keep us cautious,” Doerflinger
said. “Potential negative wild cards” for future quarters are
weaker commodity prices and an overhang of losses that are
mostly mortgage-related at banks, he said.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  predicted combined profit by
companies in the S&P 500 will rise to $25 a share in the third
quarter,  David Kostin , the New York-based equity strategist,
wrote in a note dated today. That’s a 16 percent increase from a
year earlier and “a modest upside surprise to consensus
estimates,” Kostin wrote.  After profits in the second quarter exceeded estimates,
analysts have been cutting forecasts for the remaining two
quarters of the year, according to Goldman. This allows for a
“low hurdle” in the third-quarter earnings season, the firm
said. Technology stocks are the most likely to beat analysts’
projections, Kostin said.  “Strong micro data from earnings results could offset poor
macro data,” he wrote. “This would indicate companies can
continue to produce strong earnings growth despite weaker
economic data, as was the case in both the first and second
quarters of 2011.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
