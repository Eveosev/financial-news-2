Phoenix Solar AG (PS4) , which builds and
sells solar plants, had a record decline in  Frankfurt  trading
after cutting its full-year sales and earnings outlook.  Phoenix Solar plunged as much as 27 percent, the steepest
intraday decline since November 2004, and was at 6.463 euros as
of 11:10 a.m. local time. The shares have lost 73 percent of
their value this year.  Consolidated losses before interest and tax are expected to
be 42 million euros ($58 million) to 49 million euros in 2011,
the Sulzemoos, Germany-based company said today in a statement.
Revenue is seen at 350 million to 400 million euros.  German solar companies including  Solarworld AG (SWV) ,  Q-Cells SE (QCE) 
and Conergy AG have been struggling to deal with weakening
demand in  Germany , which has cut subsidies twice since June
2010. They’re also under pressure from Chinese manufacturers
that boosted production capacity just as demand slowed, causing
cell and module prices to plummet.  “The primary cause of the now expected high losses is the
writedown of inventories resulting from the continuing decline
in the market price for solar panels,” Phoenix Solar said
today. “The change in outlook reflects a weaker-than-expected
market recovery in the second half of 2011, particularly in
Germany.”  The company said it didn’t expect a year-end rally in
Germany, which added a record 7,400 megawatts of panels in 2010
on surging sales in the final months of the year.  The new forecast is “way below expectations,” and a
“negative read-across for the entire sector,” Sven Kuerten, an
analyst at DZ Bank AG in Frankfurt, said in an e-mailed note.  Phoenix Solar said it would analyze “potential
adjustments” to its business model and is looking to cut costs
to return to profitability in fiscal 2012.  SMA Solar Technology AG (S92) , Germany’s biggest solar company by
market value, fell 6 percent, while Solarworld retreated 5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
