Kenya ’s shilling strengthened the
most in almost two weeks as the central bank offered to drain
 money supply  through a repurchase agreement.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
1.3 percent to 104.75 at 12:31 p.m. in Nairobi, the strongest
intraday gain since Sept. 29.  Kenya’s central bank offered 10 billion shillings ($95
million) of seven-day  repurchase agreements , according to a
central bank official who declined to be identified in line with
the regulator’s policy.  “The shilling has strengthened following the central bank
decision to curb liquidity in the market through a 10 billion
shilling repurchase agreement,” Chris Muiga a senior trader at
Nairobi-based Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said by phone today.  The Central Bank of Kenya raised its benchmark  interest
rate  by 4 percentage points to a record 11 percent on Oct. 5,
signalling a policy shift in a bid to combat inflation and
rescue the shilling.  Kenya’s parliamentary finance committee proposed long-term
measures to address supply-side problems including increased
domestic food production and building food reserves to reduce
imports, Chris Okemo, head of the parliamentary finance
committee, said yesterday in Nairobi.  The committee will meet officials from the agriculture,
finance and energy ministries at a future date to discuss the
measures, Okemo said.  The shilling has depreciated 23 percent this year, making
it the world’s worst performer against the dollar. Inflation
accelerated for the eleventh consecutive month in September to
17.3 percent from 16.7 percent in August, more than triple the
government’s target.
