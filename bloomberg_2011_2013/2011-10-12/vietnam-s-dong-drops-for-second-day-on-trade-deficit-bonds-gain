Vietnam ’s dong held near a two-week
low on speculation policy makers will allow the currency to
weaken as the nation’s trade deficit widens.  Government bonds 
gained.  The shortfall jumped to $1 billion last month from a
revised $396 million in August, government data show. The
 exchange rate  is under “large” pressure as the nation’s
foreign-exchange reserves remain “thin,” Communist Party
General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong said in the text of a speech
posted on the government’s website on Oct. 10.  The dong traded at 20,873 per dollar as of 2:50 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,868 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the currency’s
reference rate at 20,668 today, the same as yesterday, according
to its website. It weakened the  reference rate  for the fourth
time this month yesterday, from 20,653 on Oct. 10. The local
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the fixing.  The central bank may weaken reference rate by less than 1
percent by the year-end, Marc Djandji and Doan Thi Thu Hoai,
analysts at  Viet Capital Securities Joint-Stock Co.  in  Ho Chi
Minh City , wrote in a research note yesterday.  “The central bank may choose to adjust the official
exchange rate on a daily basis rather than a one-time adjustment
to avoid a shock,” the analysts wrote.  The yield on Vietnam’s five-year bonds fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.41 percent, according to
a daily fixing price from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
