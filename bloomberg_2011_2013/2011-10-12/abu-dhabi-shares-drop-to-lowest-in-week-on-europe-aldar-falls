Abu Dhabi ’s shares retreated to the
lowest in a week after Slovak lawmakers failed to approve an
overhaul of Europe’s bailout fund, raising concern that the
region won’t be able to resolve its debt crisis.  Aldar Properties PJSC (ALDAR) , an Abu Dhabi developer that’s had
three chief executive officers in four years, slumped to the
lowest intraday level on record. Sorouh Real Estate PJSC, Abu
Dhabi’s second-biggest property developer by market value, lost
2 percent. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  dropped 0.1 percent to
2,491.95 at 11:52 a.m. in the emirate, poised for the lowest
close since Oct. 5. The measure lost as much as 0.3 percent
earlier. About 14 million shares traded in Abu Dhabi today,
compared with a 12-month daily average of about 67 million.  “These days local asset managers have to spend more and
more time digesting global news,” said Ahmed Talhaoui, head of
asset management at Abu Dhabi-based Royal Capital PJSC.
“Downgrades continue in  Europe  with Spanish banks. Even if
expected, that doesn’t help the mood.”  Slovakia, the only country that hasn’t ratified a revised
European Financial Stability Facility, headed for a second vote
after failing to approve the package yesterday. S&P said it no
longer sees 2012 as a “turnaround year” for Spanish banks and
the rating company expects problematic assets to “continue
accumulating during 2012 and potentially into the first months
of early 2013.”  Oil Declines  The STOXX Europe 600 Index dropped 0.9 percent and Standard
& Poor’s 500 futures fell 0.4 percent. Crude for November
delivery declined as much as 1.5 percent to $84.52 a barrel.
Gulf Arab oil exporters, including the U.A.E. and  Saudi Arabia ,
supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  Aldar sank as much as 2.8 percent to 1.05 dirhams, the
lowest intraday level since listing in April 2005. It last
traded at 1.07 dirhams. Sorouh retreated for a third day to 98
fils, poised for the lowest close on record.  Kuwait’s gauge decreased 0.4 percent. Oman’s MSM 30 Index
fell 0.3 percent. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  gained 0.1 percent and
Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  climbed 0.2 percent, while Bahrain’s BB All
Share Index and the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  were little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
