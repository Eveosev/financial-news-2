The trustee liquidating  Bernard
Madoff ’s firm opposed an effort by Melvyn Weiss, the disbarred
co-founding partner of the law firm Milberg LLP, to move a
lawsuit to district court.  The trustee,  Irving Picard , who sued Weiss and other
defendants in  bankruptcy court  demanding the return of money
withdrawn from Madoff’s Ponzi scheme, said Weiss’s search for
another judge was “a waste of time and resources,” according
to a court filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
