Yields on Colombian peso bonds due
August 2026 fell to 7.65 percent at a government auction of
fixed-rate securities today.  The yield on the bonds declined from 7.75 percent at the
last auction on Sept. 28.  Colombia  also sold bonds due October 2018 to yield 6.96
percent, down from 6.97 percent, while the yield on the October
2015 securities fell to 6.25 percent from 6.27 percent, the
 Finance Ministry  said in a statement. Investor demand for the
fixed-rate securities totaled 1 trillion pesos ($528 million),
more than three times the 300 billion pesos of debt offered, the
ministry said in the statement.  Colombia has no plans to begin meeting its 2012 financing
needs by auctioning more local bonds, known as TES, after this
year’s issuance program ends this month, Public Credit Director
German Arce said in an interview yesterday. The government’s
2011 financing plan includes auctioning 18 trillion pesos worth
of TES.  To contact the reporter on this story:
