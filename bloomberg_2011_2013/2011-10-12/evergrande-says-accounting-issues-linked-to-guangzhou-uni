Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. (3333) ,
China’s second-biggest developer by sales, posted correct
information on its assets and an investigation by the nation’s
finance ministry on accounting irregularities refers to its
Guangzhou unit.  China’s ministry of finance said the company will pay a
penalty for inaccurate accounting information for its 2009
statement. Evergrande’s Guangzhou unit failed to combine the
assets of its 57 subsidiaries, CEO Xia Haijun said at a press
conference in  Hong Kong , adding that it has since amended that
practice in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
