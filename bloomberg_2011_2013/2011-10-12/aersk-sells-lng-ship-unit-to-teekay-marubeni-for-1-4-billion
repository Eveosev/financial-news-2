A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, Denmark’s
largest company, agreed to sell its liquefied natural gas tanker
unit to Teekay LNG Partners LP and Marubeni Corp. for $1.4
billion in cash.  The unit owns six LNG vessels and has 26 percent stakes in
two additional ships. Five of the ships are operating under
long-term leases with an average of 17 years left to run,
Bermuda-based Teekay said in a statement. The other three are on
short-term contracts.  “Maersk LNG does not in itself have the neccessary scale
to significantly influence the overall development of the
industry,” the Copenhagen-based company said in a statement.
“The conclusion is that Maersk LNG would benefit from a
different ownership.”  The venture between Teekay and Japanese trading company
Marubeni will borrow $1.12 billion to finance the deal. The rest
will be paid for in cash by the two partners, according to
Teekay’s statement.  Teekay said the purchase will be accretive to the company’s
cash flow.  Marubeni told Bloomberg on Oct. 5 it was bidding for Maersk
LNG in a 50-50 partnership with Teekay LNG. Maersk was advised
by Deutsche Bank on the transaction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
