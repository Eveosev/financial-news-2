Platinum Underwriters Holdings Ltd. (PTP) 
fell the most in seven months after the reinsurer said it
underestimated the costs of second-quarter catastrophes.  Platinum dropped $2.09, or 6.6 percent to $29.68 at 10:26
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock has slumped
34 percent this year, compared with the 14 percent fall of the
Russell 2000 Financial Services Index.  Third-quarter earnings will be reduced by $112.4 million
including claims from Hurricane Irene in August and additional
costs from the earthquakes that stuck Japan and  New Zealand  in
the first half of the year, the company said late yesterday in a
statement. The New Zealand temblors in February and June are
responsible for about $54 million of the total, the Bermuda-
based reinsurer said.  “We view the magnitude of the losses as disappointing,”
said analysts led by Dean Evans at  KBW Inc. (KBW)  Evans lowered his
12-month price target on the stock to $36 from $39.  To contact the reporter on this story:
