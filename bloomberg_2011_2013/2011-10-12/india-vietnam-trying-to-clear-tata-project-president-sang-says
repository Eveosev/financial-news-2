India and Vietnam are trying to
clear  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) ’s proposed $5 billion factory in the
Southeast Asian nation, delayed for more than four years by
regulatory hurdles.  “We understand the importance of the  Tata Group ,”
Vietnam’s President Truong Tan Sang told reporters today in  New
Delhi . “Indian and Vietnamese officials are trying their best
to kickstart the project.”  Vietnam set up a group of officials from the central and
provincial governments to resolve land clearance and
compensation issues. The group will work with Tata Steel
executives to find a solution within a month, Vice Minister of
Planning and Investment Dang Huy Dong said on Aug. 31. The
proposed factory would rank among Vietnam’s biggest by
investment capital.  Tata Steel,  India ’s largest producer, first signed an
agreement with Vietnam Steel Corp. in May 2007 to develop a
plant with an output capacity of about 4.5 million metric tons a
year in coastal Ha Tinh province. The Indian company, which
operates in Africa, Europe and Australia, estimated the first
phase of the project would be completed by the end of 2010,
according to a 2008 press release.  Tata Steel would have a minimum 65 percent stake in the
project, with Vietnam Steel Corp. and Vietnam Cement Industries
Corp. the remainder, according to the 2008 press release. Tata
would also hold a 30 percent stake in Thach Khe Iron Ore Joint
Stock Company, which would undertake mining in the Thach Khe
iron ore mine, according to details on Tata Steel’s  website .  To contact the reporters on this story:  To contact the reporter on this story:
