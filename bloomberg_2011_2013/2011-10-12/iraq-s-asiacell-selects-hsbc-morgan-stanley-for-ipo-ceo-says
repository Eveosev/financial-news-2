Iraq ’s Asiacell, an affiliate of
Qatar Telecom QSC, selected  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
to manage an initial public offering on the Iraqi bourse, Chief
Executive Officer Diar Ahmed said.  He said the company will offer 25 percent of its shares,
declining to give a timeframe.  “The company as a whole will be listed and we will offer
25 percent of shares to the public,” he said in a telephone
interview today. Asiacell is in talks with Iraqi authorities to
complete the listing procedures and set a timeframe, he said.  The company should also convert from a limited liability
company to a shareholding company before listing on the stock
exchange, according to regulations.  Mobile Telecommunications Co.,  Kuwait ’s biggest mobile-
phone company, also known as Zain, as well as Asiacell, and
Korek Telecom, part-owned by  France Telecom SA (FTE) , were due to
trade 25 percent of their shares on the Iraq Stock Exchange by
the end of August, according to their licenses.  The three companies will be fined for missing the Aug. 31
deadline, Salim Mashkour, a member of the trustee board of
Iraq’s Communications and Media Commission, said yesterday.  “We have heard that there won’t be fines, as this would
not be helpful for the process,” Ahmed said.  Iraq has 23 million mobile-phone subscribers, according to
an Oct. 5 statement by the Communications and Media Commission.  To contact the reporters on this story:
