European Union President Herman  Van
Rompuy  and European Commission President  Jose Barroso  called on
Slovakia’s feuding leaders to set aside local politics and
quickly approve the expanded euro rescue fund.  “This is about the prosperity of us all,” the two
officials said in a joint statement released by the commission
in Brussels today. “We call on all parties in the Slovak
parliament to rise above the positioning of short-term
politics.”  Van Rompuy and Barroso urged “swift adoption” of the
upgraded European Financial Stability Facility, which failed in
a first parliamentary vote yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
