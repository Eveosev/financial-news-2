YIT Oyj (YTY1V) ,  Finland ’s biggest builder,
slumped 6.3 percent to 12.20 euros at the start of trading in
Helsinki after cutting its full-year outlook for operating
profit.  YIT made a 10 million-euro ($13.7 million) provision in its
third-quarter earnings as it deals with excess ammonia found in
flats it constructed in  St. Petersburg ,  Russia . YIT said
operating profit in 2011 will increase, compared with a
projection of a “clear” increase versus 2010.  YIT is negotiating compensation with insurance companies
and concrete suppliers, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
