Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam’s gains from  insider trading  were at least $50
million, U.S. prosecutors said in response to arguments by his
lawyers that he doesn’t deserve a stiff sentence for his crimes.  The defense’s calculations on gains Rajaratnam made as a
result of his insider-trading scheme “would not come out
anywhere close to bringing the overall number below $50 million
and thus place Rajaratnam in a different bracket of gain,”
prosecutors said today in a filing in federal court in
 Manhattan .  Rajaratnam, 54, was convicted in May of 14 counts of
 securities fraud  and conspiracy. Prosecutors, saying he made
$72 million from his crimes, asked for a prison term of 19 years
and seven months to 24 1/2 years, which Rajaratnam’s lawyers
called “grotesquely severe.”  Rajaratnam’s lawyers said he made only $7.4 million from
the trades. Based on that amount and other findings that
Rajaratnam’s lawyers are asking the judge to make, he is seeking
a term of 6 1/2 to 8 years, said a person familiar with the
defense case who spoke on condition of anonymity.  John Dowd , a lawyer for Rajaratnam, declined to comment on
the sentencing range.  Rajaratnam is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District
Judge Richard Holwell on Oct. 13.  The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-01184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
