Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Jakarta.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  rose 3 percent to 3,635.93.  Banks: PT Bank Mandiri (BMRI IJ),  Indonesia ’s biggest bank
by assets, rose 3.1 percent to 6,650 rupiah, the highest close
since Sept. 16. PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI IJ), the second
largest by market value, gained 3.2 percent to 6,450 rupiah.  Bank Indonesia’s decision to cut its benchmark interest
rate yesterday for the first time in more than two years is
unlikely to be a one-time policy move, Deyi Tan and Seen Meng
Chew, analysts at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note today. The
central bank cut the benchmark rate to 6.5 percent from 6.75
percent to spur economic growth.  Palm oil producers: PT Astra Agro Lestari (AALI IJ), the
nation’s largest listed plantation company by market value,
jumped 6.5 percent to 18,100 rupiah, the steepest gain since
Jan. 25. PT Sampoerna Agro (SGRO IJ) rallied 3.7 percent to
2,825 rupiah.  Palm oil futures advanced as much as 2.6 percent to 2,874
ringgit ($917) a metric ton in  Kuala Lumpur , rising for a third
consecutive day.  PT Dian Swastatika Sentosa (DSSA IJ), a power producer,
climbed 3.9 percent to 13,500 rupiah, closing at the highest
level since Sept. 21. Dian Swastatika provided a $100 million,
one-year loan to a unit for the development of a power plant in
South Sumatra, Kontan reported, citing Corporate Secretary
Hermawan Tarjono. Three calls to the company’s office in Jakarta
