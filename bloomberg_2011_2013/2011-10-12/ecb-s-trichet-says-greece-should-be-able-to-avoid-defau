European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said  Greece  should be able to avoid default.  “A very large adjustment is necessary in Greece to correct
the errors of the past in the greater interests of the country
and in the interests of growth and sustainable  job creation ,”
Trichet said in an interview with French magazine L’Express
posted on the ECB’s website.  When asked whether the debt-strapped country will be able
to avoid a default, Trichet said: “The commitments made by
Greece and those made by all the European countries on 21 July
should enable the scenario you mention to be avoided, and we
have always warned the governments against it.”  Trichet also said governments must be able to increase the
effectiveness of the region’s rescue fund “through recourse to
a ‘leveraging’ effect.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
