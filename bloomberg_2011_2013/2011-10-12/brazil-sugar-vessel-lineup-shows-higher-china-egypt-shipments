The amount of sugar awaiting
shipment to  China  and  Egypt  from ports in top global producer
Brazil rose 18 percent in the past week, according to data from
Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltd.  Vessels destined for China and Egypt are waiting to load
341,000 metric tons of the sweetener as of today, up from
288,450 tons on Oct. 5, the data showed. Shipments to China
amounted to 165,000 tons, while exports to Egypt totaled 176,000
tons, according to Williams Brasil.  Raw-sugar imports by Egyptâ€™s state-owned Sugar and
Integrated Industries Co. will exceed 400,000 tons this year.
Since the year began, the company has agreed to buy 365,000
tons, Hussein Ahmed, a purchasing manager, said in an interview
on Sept. 22.  China may need to import as much as 3 million tons of the
sweetener in 2011-12 as production will lag behind demand by 2.5
million tons, according to Sucden, the trading arm of Paris-
based company Sucres et Denrees SA.  ED&F Man Holdings Ltd., Bunge Ltd. and Cargill Inc. will be
sending the sweetener to Egypt, while Noble Group Ltd., Bunge
and Louis Dreyfus will be shipping to China, the data show.  White, or refined, sugar for December delivery rose $5.90,
or 0.9 percent, to $674.40 a ton by 3:19 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in
 London . Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 0.13 cent, or 0.5
percent, to 26.07 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
