Munich Re’s Hartford Steam Boiler
unit, the factory-equipment insurer acquired from  American
International Group Inc. (AIG) , was upgraded by A.M. Best Co. based on
the prospect of improved sales in  Europe .  The unit’s financial strength rating was lifted to A++ from
A+ as its ownership by the German insurer may have “provided
access to new markets in continental Europe and refocused the
U.S. business on HSB’s core equipment-breakdown coverage,” the
ratings firm said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
