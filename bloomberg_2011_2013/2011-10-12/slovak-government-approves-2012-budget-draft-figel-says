Slovakia’s government, which lost a
no-confidence vote yesterday, approved the 2012 budget draft
that targets a deficit of 3.8 percent of gross domestic product,
Deputy Premier Jan Figel said.  The Cabinet will submit the spending plan to parliament,
where its support is uncertain after a rift in the coalition led
to the government’s collapse yesterday, Figel told journalists
today in the capital, Bratislava.  Prime Minsiter Iveta Radicova’s government fell after
Freedom and Solidarity, a junior ruling party, didn’t back an
overhaul of the European bailout mechanism, to which the no-
confidence motion was tied. Figel urged deputies of the rebel
party, known as SaS, to back the budget.  Smer, the largest opposition party, will continue to oppose
legislation submitted by the government even after striking an
agreement with Radicova’s party on early elections in March,
 Robert Fico , the party chairman, said today.  The budget, which cuts the deficit from a projected 4.9
percent of GDP this year, is based on an assumption of a 3.4
percent economic growth. Finance Minister Ivan Miklos has said
the ministry will revise its economic forecasts next month and
will adjust the budget if necessary to keep the deficit goal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
