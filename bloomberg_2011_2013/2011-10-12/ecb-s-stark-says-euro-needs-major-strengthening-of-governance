European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said the euro area needs a “major
strengthening” of economic governance if the currency area is
to solve its problems.  The “ultimate objective” is “institutional arrangements
that provide credible incentives for sound policies,” Stark
said at an event in  Riga  today. Countries “should be aware this
requires the transfer of sovereignty to a central institution
with much stronger powers.”  Stark announced his resignation from the ECB board on Sept.
9 after signaling discontent over the ECB’s program of buying
the bonds of debt-strapped European governments. The European
Parliament’s economic committee endorsed German Deputy Finance
Minister  Joerg Asmussen  as Stark’s replacement on Oct. 10.  The reform package agreed by the European Union “falls
short of the ‘quantum leap’ in economic governance that the ECB
has long advocated for the euro area,” Stark said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
