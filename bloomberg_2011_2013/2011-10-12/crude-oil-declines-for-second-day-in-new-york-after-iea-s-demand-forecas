Oil dropped for a second day in New
York as signs of weakening U.S. fuel demand and slowing crude
imports in  China  stoked speculation that consumption will falter
in the world’s largest energy users.  Futures fell as much as 1.9 percent before the Energy
Department publishes figures that may show that crude
inventories rose last week. The  American Petroleum Institute 
said yesterday that U.S. gasoline demand slid the most in more
than five years. China’s net crude imports declined to the
third-lowest level this year, the customs bureau said today.  “ Oil prices  are still high compared to the economic risks
we face, not only in  Europe  but also in the U.S. and  Asia ,”
said  Sintje Diek , an analyst at  HSH Nordbank  in Hamburg who
correctly predicted in January that prices would fall in the
second half of the year. “Overall, volatility is very high.”  Crude for November delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  declined as much as $1.63 to $83.94 a barrel in
electronic trading. It was at $84.11 at 1:09 p.m. London time.
Yesterday, the contract slid 24 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$85.57. Prices are down 8 percent this year.  Brent oil for November settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange fell $1.76, or 1.6 percent, to $109.60 a
barrel. The European benchmark crude was at a premium of $25.49
to the U.S. contract. It reached a record of $26.87 on Sept. 6.
The more actively traded December Brent future fell $1.20 to
$107.77.  Gasoline Consumption  Implied gasoline demand in the U.S., the world’s biggest
oil consumer, dropped 10.5 percent in the week to Oct. 7, the
API report showed. That’s the biggest decline since March 2006.
Crude stockpiles fell 3.81 million barrels to 340.4 million, the
lowest in nine months.  The Energy Department may say today inventories rose
800,000 barrels, according to the median estimate of 15 analyst
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Initial jobless claims in the U.S.,
the world’s biggest crude consumer, rose for a second week to
405,000 in the period ended Oct. 8, a separate report may show.  Oil may extend losses in  New York  if futures settle below
chart support along the 50-day moving average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prices have closed in the past three days
above this level, around $84.86 a barrel today. Sell orders tend
to be clustered below technical-support levels.  China Economy  China, the world’s second-largest oil user, reduced net
imports of the commodity in September as the economy slowed. Net
purchases declined to 4.92 million barrels a day last month from
4.95 million in August, according to data from the General
Administration of Customs today. Purchases exceeded 5 million
barrels a day in each of the first five months of this year.  The nation’s economic growth slowed to 9.3 percent in the
third quarter from 9.5 percent in the second, based on the
median estimate of economists polled by Bloomberg News. Export
growth in September slowed to the lowest in seven months, a
report today showed.  The  International Energy Agency  cut its 2012 oil-demand
estimate by 210,000 barrels a day yesterday and predicted output
from  Libya  will rebound faster than earlier forecast.  Libya, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, may pump about 600,000 barrels a day of crude by the
end of the year, up from an earlier estimate of as much as
400,000 barrels, according to the IEA. The national  oil company 
and international partners have restored production from some
areas and four fields have started, the Paris-based agency said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
