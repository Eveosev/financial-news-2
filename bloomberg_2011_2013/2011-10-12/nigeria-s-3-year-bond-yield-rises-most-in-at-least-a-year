Nigerian bonds declined sending
yields for three-year notes to the highest in at least a year,
spurred by the central bank’s record increase of its benchmark
interest rate.  The yield on 5.5 percent debt of  Africa ’s top oil producer
due 2013 surged 81 basis points to 13.56 percent, according to
data from the Financial Market Dealers Association. That’s the
highest since September 2010, when Bloomberg started compiling
the data.  The central bank raised its benchmark rate by 275 basis
points to 12 percent on Oct. 10, the most since it was
introduced in 2007, to help bolster the naira and curb
inflation. Pressure had built up on the currency from declining
prices for crude oil, the source of 95 percent of the country’s
export earnings, and mounting demand for foreign currency to
fund imports.  “Bond yields increased because of investors taking
advantage of the rise in benchmark  interest rate ,” Wale Abe,
chief executive officer of the Financial Market Dealers
Association, an interbank clearing house for Nigerian banks,
said today by phone from Lagos. “We expect more of such
investments in short-tenured bonds.”  The 9.45 percent bond due 2013 rose 47 basis points to
12.65 percent, while the 8.50 percent debt due 2029 jumped 100
basis points, rising to 14.68 percent.  The naira rallied for a second day against the dollar,
climbing 2 percent to 155.75 per dollar by 1:12 p.m. in Lagos,
the commercial capital, taking its gain in the past two days to
5.1 percent, biggest two-day advance since November 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
