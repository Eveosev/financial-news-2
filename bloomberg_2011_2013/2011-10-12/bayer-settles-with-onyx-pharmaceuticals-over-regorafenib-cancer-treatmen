Bayer AG (BAYN)  settled a lawsuit with Onyx
Pharmaceuticals Inc. over the promotion and sale of regorafenib,
a cancer treatment. Onyx jumped 6.5 percent in early U.S.
trading.  Under the agreement reached yesterday, Bayer will pay Onyx
a 20 percent royalty on worldwide sales of regorafenib for use
in oncology, South San Francisco-based Onyx said today in a
regulatory filing. Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer also will pay
Onyx $160 million for the Japanese royalty rights for Nexavar, a
liver-cancer treatment, according to the filing.  “These new agreements strengthen the collaboration and
provide Onyx the opportunity to participate significantly in the
market potential of regorafenib,” Onyx Chief Executive Officer
N. Anthony Coles said in a statement distributed by PR Newswire.  Onyx climbed $2.09 to $34 in trading before U.S. markets
opened. The shares had declined 13 percent on the Nasdaq Stock
Market this year before today.  Regorafenib hasn’t been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration or the European Medicines Agency, according to
the statement. Nexavar is approved in the U.S.  The case is  Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX)  v. Bayer Corp., 09-
2145, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California ( San
Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
