The Italian government has approved
a plan to break up  Edison SpA (EDN)  and sell part of it to  EDF SA (EDF)  of
France, news agency Radiocor reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Italian Industry Minister Paolo Romani asked EDF Chief
Executive Officer Henri Proglio to give Edison’s Italian
investors an “honorable” exit, either in cash or assets,
according to Radiocor. The transaction should be completed by
an Oct. 31 deadline, the news agency reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
