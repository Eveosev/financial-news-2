Ghana ’s cedi weakened for a fourth
day as banks bought back dollars to shore up supplies after low
foreign-investor interest in a three-year bond auction planned
by the central bank for tomorrow.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated as much as 0.2 percent to 1.6349 per dollar before
paring the loss to trade at 1.6319 per dollar as of 3:37 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Offshore interest in the bonds is so far disappointing,”
Coura Fall, a Johannesburg-based currency trading analyst at
Citigroup Inc., said in an e-mailed comment today. Some lenders
may be “short dollars in expectation of dollar inflows for the
bonds” and are now looking to rebuild their reserves, Fall said.  The Accra-based  Bank of Ghana  will offer 300 million cedis
($184 million) worth of the debt tomorrow, it said Sept. 27.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
