The  Swiss People’s Party  is likely
to gain the most votes in this month’s general elections,
followed by the Social Democrats, the  Gfs.Bern polling institute 
reported, citing a survey.  The  People’s Party  may win 29.3 percent of the vote, while
the Social Democrats would get 19.9 percent, the Bern-based
institute said in an e-mailed statement today, citing a
telephone survey among 2,007 participants conducted Oct. 1 to
Oct. 8. Some 15.2 percent of voters would back the Free
Democrats, with the  Christian Democrats  winning 14.2 percent.  All four parties are members of the governing coalition.
The margin of error was 2.2 percentage points, Gfs.Bern said.  The SVP gained 1.3 percentage points since the institute’s
last survey published Sept. 9. Swiss voters will cast their
ballots on Oct. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
