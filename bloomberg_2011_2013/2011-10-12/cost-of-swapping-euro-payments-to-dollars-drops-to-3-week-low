A measure of how much European banks
pay to fund in dollars declined to the lowest more than three
weeks amid investor optimism  Europe  is tackling its debt crisis.  The one-year cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks pay
to convert euro payments into dollars, fell to 63 basis points
below the euro interbank offered rate as of 12:47 p.m. in
London, from 68 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the smallest gap since Sept. 16.  The European Commission’s Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said a consensus on resolving Europe’s
debt crisis is in the making. Slovakia Finance Minister Ivan
Miklos said parliament will probably approve the revamped
European Financial Stability Fund this week after failing to
adopt it yesterday.  “Slovakia is delaying but not compromising its final
decisions on EFSF,” Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income strategist
at Newedge Group SA in London, said in an interview. “A more
solid government in Slovakia and some changes in  Italy  might be
good news for the euro area in the medium term.”  The three-month cross-currency basis swap, fell to 91.5
basis points under Euribor from 95 yesterday. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
Europe rose. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, increased to 74
basis points from 71 yesterday. The rate reached 89 basis points
on Sept. 23, the widest since March 2009.  ECB Deposits  Overnight deposits at the  European Central Bank  fell as
banks made adjustments to meet their commitments to the so-
called maintenance period. Banks parked 62 billion euros ($85
billion) at the Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, down from 269
billion euros on Oct. 10. That compares with a year-to-date
average of 58 billion euros.  Six banks bid for three-month dollar loans from the ECB
today, snapping up $1.35 billion in the central bank’s first 84-
day dollar tender. The banks will pay a fixed rate of 1.09
percent.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- rose to 1.571 percent from 1.570
percent yesterday. One-week Euribor fell to 1.186 percent from
1.191 percent.  The three-month dollar  London  interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for a 24th day to 0.401 percent from 0.398 percent,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the
highest since Aug. 9, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, was
unchanged at 39.  To contact the reporters on this story:
