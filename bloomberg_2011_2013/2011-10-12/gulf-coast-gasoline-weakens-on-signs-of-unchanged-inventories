Gulf Coast gasoline weakened on
expectations that a government report tomorrow will show that
supplies of the fuel were unchanged more than a month after the
end of the summer driving demand season.  Gasoline inventories in the week ended Oct. 7 may have held
steady at 213.7 million barrels, according to the median
estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. The summer
driving season ended on the U.S. Labor Day holiday Sept. 5.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf region weakened 1.5 cents to 1.3 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 12:34
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
fell 1.95 cents to $2.7561 a gallon.  Husky Energy Inc. returned an isocracker to service at the
Lima refinery in  Ohio  after maintenance,  Graham White , a company
spokesman, said in an e-mail. The unit is approaching full
rates, he said.  Regular gasoline in  Chicago  slipped 0.63 cent to a discount
versus futures of 7.5 cents a gallon.  Crude throughput at the Husky plant was expected to be
130,000 to 135,000 barrels a day during the work, between 80
percent and 85 percent of capacity, Carla Yuill, a spokeswoman
for the Calgary-based company, said Sept. 6 in an e-mail.  The Lima refinery has a capacity of 155,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Isocrackers, also known
as hydrocrackers, convert heavy oil into lighter fuels such as
high-octane gasoline or high-grade  fuel oil  through the
catalytic addition of hydrogen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
