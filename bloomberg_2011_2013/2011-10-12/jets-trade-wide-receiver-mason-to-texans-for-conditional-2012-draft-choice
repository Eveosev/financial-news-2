The  New York Jets  traded wide
receiver Derrick Mason to the Houston Texans for a conditional
2012 draft choice.  Mason, 37, who was in his first season with the Jets after
spending eight with Tennessee and the last six with Baltimore,
had 13 catches for 115 yards this season.  “I thought Derrick would catch 80 to 90 balls,” Jets
coach  Rex Ryan  told reporters two days ago. “That hasn’t
happened.”  The New York Daily News reported on Oct. 9 that Mason along
with receivers Santonio Holmes and Plaxico Burress went to coach
Rex Ryan to complain about the team’s offense.  “Things didn’t work out on the field with Derrick,” Jets
General Manager Mike Tannenbaum said today during a televised
news conference.  After winning their first two games, the Jets have lost
three straight.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
