Greek finance ministry workers
blocked access to the ministry’s main building in central  Athens 
as part of protests against government plans to cut jobs and
wages.  Members of the Federation of Finance Ministry Unions hung a
banner reading ‘Occupation’ from the roof of the eight-story
building and hoisted black flags around the roof. The federation
plans a nine-day strike beginning Oct. 17, according to an e-
mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
