Investors are betting that  U.S.
Treasuries  will decline for the first time in three weeks,
according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. customer survey.  The percent of net “shorts” in the firm’s “all clients”
survey rose to 2 percent for the week ending Oct. 11, compared
with a net “long” position of 11 percent the prior week. About
85 percent of the clients surveyed remained neutral. A short
position is a wager the price of a security will fall, while a
long position is a bet it will rise.  Treasury yields have risen since reaching record lows on
Sept. 23, two days after the  Federal Reserve  announced purchases
of the securities as part of a plan known as Operation Twist.
Yields on 10-year securities rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 2.21 percent at 8:48 a.m. in  New York ,
after falling to a record 1.6714 percent on Sept. 23.  JPMorgan doesn’t disclose the number of clients in the
survey. Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in New York,
wasn’t immediately available to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
