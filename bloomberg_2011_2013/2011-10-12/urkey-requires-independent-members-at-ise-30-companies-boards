Turkey ’s market regulator requires
the appointment of at least one independent member to boards of
companies other than banks in the  Istanbul Stock Exchange ’s
National 30 index to ensure that “minority investors are
effectively represented” and boards disputes “due to possible
clashes of interest” are avoided.  The move is aimed at enforcing certain corporate governance
principles at the ISE National 30 firms, to support Turkish
firms’ competitiveness amid a global financial crisis, the
Ankara-based capital market board  said  on its website late
yesterday after the government published related legislation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
