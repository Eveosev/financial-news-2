Singapore’s economic growth probably
nearly stalled last quarter as a faltering global recovery hurt
exports, putting pressure on the central bank to join nations
from  Indonesia  to  Pakistan  in easing monetary policy.  Gross domestic product probably rose an annualized 0.8
percent last quarter from the previous three months, when it
fell 6.5 percent, according to the median of 16 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. The Monetary Authority of Singapore,
which uses the island’s dollar as its main tool to manage
inflation, may slow or end currency appreciation, a separate
survey showed. Both reports will be released at 8 a.m. tomorrow.  Any return to recession for the global economy would
threaten a Singaporean economy that saw an 11 percent collapse
in exports in 2009. With a potential Greek default threatening
to reverberate through world financial markets,  Singapore  may
shift to stimulus measures just six months after its last
monetary tightening.  “With the U.S. and European indicators pointing to a
sluggish, faltering recovery and no signs of any determined
policy response, Singapore’s investment and external demand
could only have deteriorated further in the third quarter,
bringing down overall GDP growth,” said Vincent Conti, a
Singapore-based analyst at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. “The MAS will likely shift to a neutral stance.”  Singapore Dollar  The  central bank  said in April it would allow further
currency appreciation to tame price gains, the third monetary
policy tightening in a year. The Singapore dollar reached
unprecedented levels since then, trading below S$1.20 against
its U.S. counterpart in July. It has dropped 6.1 percent since
the beginning of August.  The monetary authority guides the  Singapore dollar  against
a basket of currencies within an undisclosed band. It adjusts
the pace of appreciation or depreciation by changing the slope,
width and center of the band.  The island located at the southern end of the 600-mile
(965-kilometer) Malacca Strait is among the first countries in
the region to report third-quarter data.  The global slowdown has prompted some Asian central banks
to start cutting  interest rates  or refrain from increasing
borrowing costs. The  Bank of Korea  left its key rate unchanged
today at 3.25 percent for a fourth straight month.  Singapore’s economy will probably expand at a slower pace
in the next few years and the central bank will continue
“judicious management” of its currency to curb inflation and
support growth, Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said Oct.
11.  Overseas Demand Risks  The city state, home to the world’s second-busiest
container port, has remained vulnerable to fluctuations in
overseas demand for manufactured goods even after Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong’s administration boosted financial services and
tourism. The government forecasts growth of 5 percent to 6
percent this year, lower than an earlier forecast of as much as
7 percent expansion.  The economy probably grew 5.6 percent in the third quarter
from a year earlier, according to the median estimate of 19
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The monetary authority will remain “vigilant” against a
resurgence in inflationary pressures and price gains are
expected to moderate toward the end of 2011, Shanmugaratnam said
this week.  The central bank raised its inflation estimate for 2011 in
July to 4 percent to 5 percent, from a previous estimate of 3
percent to 4 percent. Inflation in August accelerated to the
fastest pace since 2008 as consumer prices rose 5.7 percent from
a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
