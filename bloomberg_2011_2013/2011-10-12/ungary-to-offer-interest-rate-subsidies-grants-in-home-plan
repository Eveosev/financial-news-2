Hungary has earmarked 6.5 billion
forint ($30.6 million) in the 2012 budget for interest-rate
subsidies and non-repayable state grants to families wishing to
purchase homes, Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said.  The state will pay a one-time aid to families with at least
two children, where one of the parents is employed, for
purchasing or building homes, Matolcsy said at a press
conference in Budapest today. The size of the grant will depend
on the number of children in a family, he said.  The government expects as many as 5,000 families applying
for interest-rate subsidies on  mortgage loans  in 2012, the
minister said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
