Corporate bond offerings surged to
the highest level in four weeks as borrowers from  General
Electric Co. (GE) ’s finance unit to  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  took advantage
of growing confidence that Europe’s debt crisis will be
contained.  Kohl’s Corp. (KSS) , the fourth-largest U.S. department store-
chain and Montreal-based National Bank of Canada are also among
companies that sold $9.1 billion of debt in the U.S. today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Laredo Petroleum Inc.
issued $200 million of high-yield, high-risk bonds in the first
offering of the debt since Sept. 27.  Issuance is showing signs of life after failing to exceed
the 2011 weekly average of $24.4 billion for three straight
periods, Bloomberg data show. Political leaders in Slovakia, the
only country in the 17-member euro area yet to sign off on the
European Financial Stability Facility, agreed today to approve
the region’s enhanced bailout fund.  “If we keep seeing positive developments out of  Europe ,
the new-issue calendar will continue to open up, maybe even to
the extent that we start to see some activity from high-yield
issuers again,”  Adrian Miller , a New York-based fixed income
strategist at Miller Tabak Roberts Securities LLC, said in a
telephone interview.  GE Capital sold $1.25 billion of five-year notes that yield
222 basis points, or 2.22 percentage points, more than similar-
maturity Treasuries and $1.75 billion of 10-year debt that pays
a 247 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show.  Time Warner issued $500 million of 4 percent, 10.25-year
securities that yield 200 basis points more than the benchmark
and the same amount of 5.375 percent, 30-year bonds that pay a
spread of 225 basis points, Bloomberg data show.  Canadian Banks  National Bank of Canada (NA)  sold $1.4 billion of five-year, 2.2
percent covered bonds and  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  issued $1.5
billion of 2.35 percent notes coming due in October 2016,
Bloomberg data show.  Kohl’s, based in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, issued $650
million of debt due in 2021 in its first offering since
September 2007, Bloomberg data show.  Petroleos Mexicanos  priced
an additional $1.25 billion of 6.5 percent bonds due in June
2041, doubling the amount outstanding.  Laredo Petroleum increased the size of its offering of 9.5
percent notes due in February 2019, which are rated Caa2 by
Moody’s Investors Service and CCC+ by  Standard & Poor’s , from
$150 million, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction who declined to be identified because the marketing
was private. The company sold $350 million of the debt in
January, Bloomberg data show.  Companies had issued $1.55 billion of debt this week
through yesterday after selling $8.63 billion during the period
ended Oct. 7, Bloomberg data show. Issuance reached $12.2
billion on Sept. 14.  Speculative, or high-yield, high-risk, corporate bonds, are
ranked below Baa3 by Moody’s and BBB- by S&P.  Editors: Pierre Paulden, John Parry  To contact the reporter on this story:
