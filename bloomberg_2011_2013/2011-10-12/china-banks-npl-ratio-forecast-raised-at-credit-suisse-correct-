(Corrects forecast in first paragraph.)  Credit Suisse Group AG raised its
forecast for Chinese banks’ non-performing loan ratio to 8-12
percent of loans in the “next few years” from 4.5-5 percent
earlier.  Real estate, manufacturing, local government and small-
medium enterprises are the “four main sources of risk,” Credit
Suisse analysts led by  Sanjay Jain  wrote in a report dated
today. The four account for about 55 percent of the loan book
and are expected to contribute “more than” 80 percent of
potential NPLs, the analysts wrote. “The NPLs would work out to
65–100 percent of banks’ equity,” they wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
