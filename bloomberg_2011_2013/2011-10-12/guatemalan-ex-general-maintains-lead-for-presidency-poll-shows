Former Guatemalan army general  Otto
Perez  Molina holds close to a 12-point lead ahead of next
month’s second round presidential election, according to a poll
conducted by Prodatos and published by Prensa Libre.  Perez, who heads the ticket for the Patriot Party, was
backed by 55.8 percent of those surveyed, compared with 44.2
percent for Manuel Baldizon of the Renewed Democratic Freedom
party, Prensa Libre  reported  today. Perez won the first round of
elections on Sept. 11 with 36 percent of the vote, while
Baldizon had 23 percent.  The Oct. 4-8 survey of 1,204 people didn’t list a margin of
error. Guatemala’s runoff vote is Nov. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
