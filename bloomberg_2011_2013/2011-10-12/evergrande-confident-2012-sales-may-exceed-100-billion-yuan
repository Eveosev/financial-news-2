Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. (3333) ,
China’s second-biggest developer by sales, said it’s
“confident” contracted sales will exceed 100 billion yuan in
2012 as it focuses on less affluent cities that aren’t affected
by the government’s property curbs.  The developer plans to increase prices and slow sales after
achieving its target of 70 billion yuan this year, Chief
Executive Officer Xia Haijun said at a press conference in  Hong
Kong  today. Evergrande doesn’t plan on buying more sites as its
land holdings are sufficient for the next five to eight years,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
