Jaime Ayovi scored in the 79th
minute to give Ecuador a 1-0 soccer exhibition win against the
U.S. last night at Red Bull Arena in Harrison,  New Jersey .  It was the third loss in five games for U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann since he replaced Bob Bradley in late July.  In another international exhibition last night, Brazil
rallied with 10 men to defeat Mexico 2-1 as Ronaldinho scored in
the 79th minute and Marcelo hit the net four minutes later at
TSM stadium in Torreon, Mexico.  Mexico scored in the 10th minute of the game when Brazilâ€™s
 David Luiz  knocked the ball into his own net, and Brazil lost
 Dani Alves  just before halftime when he received his second
yellow card.  To contact the reporter on this story:
