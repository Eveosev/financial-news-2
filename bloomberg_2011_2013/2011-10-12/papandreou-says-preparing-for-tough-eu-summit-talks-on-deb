Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said support of an austerity bill and the 2012 budget
in Parliament before a European Union summit later this month
will help “difficult” talks.  “Parliament’s support of basic decisions we have taken
before the summit will be an important step to achieve the best
terms in a difficult negotiation,” Papandreou told his Cabinet
in  Athens  today, according to an e-mailed transcript of his
comments.  Papandreou said the government was “negotiating in every
way on lightening the debt” and that the country needed to stop
producing deficits. He repeated the goal of a primary surplus
for next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
