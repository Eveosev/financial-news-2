The 28 percent plunge in zinc that
drove the metal into a  bear market  may be ending as record
demand from steelmakers erodes stockpiles and the price slump
spurs producers to curb output.  About 50 percent of zinc is used to rust-proof steel and
production of the alloy reached an all-time high of 31.7 million
metric tons in the second quarter, according to Macquarie Group
Ltd. Global stockpiles monitored by exchanges in London and
Shanghai are the lowest since April. Prices may climb as much as
27 percent to $2,450 a ton next year, according to the median in
a Bloomberg survey of 10 producers, analysts and traders.  Prices plunged 58 percent since reaching a record $4,580 in
2006 as increased production created a five-year glut. The
surplus is narrowing as consumption expands to a record, and
will shrink next year to its smallest since 2007, according to
Morgan Stanley. China expanding at more than twice the speed of
the global economy and using more steel than ever may mean
shortages as early as 2014, the bank estimates.  “I’m bullish with regards to zinc over the next two to
three years and even longer,” said  Gavin Wendt , the founder and
senior resource analyst at Sydney-based Mine Life Pty., who has
followed the  mining industry  for two decades. “Given the level
of underlying demand for zinc and at the same time the fact that
new reserves are not being added, there is going to be a supply
side problem to emerge over the next few years.”  Price Drop  Zinc declined in three of the past four years on the London
Metal Exchange, the worst performance of any of the six main
industrial metals. Benchmark three-month futures slumped to
$1,820 from $2,539.50 since July on speculation that slowing
global growth will sap demand. The metal fell 1.7 percent to
$1,913a ton today in  London . The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of
24 raw materials entered a bear market last month after
retreating more than 20 percent since April.  More than $9 trillion has been wiped off the value of
global equities since May as the MSCI All-Country World Index of
equities retreated about 17 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Treasuries maturing in 10 years or more returned 24
percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analyst Societies.  This year’s anticipated production surplus of 270,000 tons
will drop to 130,000 in 2012, Morgan Stanley estimates. Demand
will advance 2.6 percent to a record 13.3 million tons in 2011
as supply increases 1.5 percent to 13.43 million tons, the bank
forecasts. That supply is valued at about $31 billion, based on
this year’s average price.  Below Cost  Production may lag behind estimates because prices are
below extraction costs at some mines, according to Macquarie.
Mines in China, accounting for about 29 percent of global
supply, need as much as $2,200 a ton to break even, the bank
estimates. The nation’s zinc-ore imports rose to the highest in
almost a year in August, customs data show.  Growth in demand may be curbed as economies slow. The
 International Monetary Fund  lowered its global growth forecasts
to 4 percent for this year and next on Sept. 20, from earlier
estimates of 4.3 percent for 2011 and 4.5 percent in 2012.  Demand contracted 5.2 percent in 2009 as the global economy
contended with its worst recession since World War II, Morgan
Stanley estimates. Crude-steel consumption fell 1.5 percent in
2008 and 6 percent in 2009, the bank estimates.  ‘Confidence Weak’  “With market confidence getting weaker about the prospects
for global growth, zinc prices will face pressure from
oversupply,” said  Tetsu Emori , the chief  fund manager  at Astmax
Co. in  Tokyo  who helps manage $400 million in assets.  While stockpiles have dropped about 7 percent since
reaching an all-time high of almost 1.3 million tons in July,
they are still more than double the four-year average. The 1.2
million tons of inventories reported by the LME and  Shanghai 
Futures Exchange are equal to more than a year of demand from
the U.S. Orders to withdraw metal from warehouses monitored by
the LME more than doubled since the start of the year.  Higher prices would boost earnings for Zug, Switzerland-
based  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and Vancouver-based  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK) , the
world’s biggest producers. The metal accounted for 10 percent of
Teck Resources’ sales last year, while Xstrata’s lead and zinc
mining brought in 13 percent of the company’s revenue, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Steel Production  World steel production may rise 7 percent to 1.6 billion
tons next year, according to the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, the state
forecaster. Steel consumption in  China  will advance 6 percent to
664 million tons in 2012, the bureau estimates.  Australia  is the
largest producer of  iron ore , the main ingredient in steel.  China’s zinc demand may reach 6.58 million tons in 2015,
compared with 4.75 million in 2010, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co., a state-backed research group, and
Raw Materials Group, a Solna, Sweden-based company that has
compiled commodities data for more than two decades. Zinc is
also combined with copper to make brass and alloyed with other
metals for electrical components.  Imports of refined zinc by China rebounded 64 percent to
26,685 tons in August after tumbling 57 percent from a 20-month
peak reached in March, customs data show. Domestic production of
zinc ore and concentrates, an intermediate product, fell 8.8
percent to 358,734 tons in July, according to the Ware, England-
based World Bureau of Metal Statistics.  “Of all the base metals, we still very much like zinc,”
Tony Hall, the chief investment officer of Duet Commodities Fund
Ltd., which manages more than $100 million of assets, told
Bloomberg Television’s “On the Move.” “We make sure that we
are accumulating and not cutting our positions.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
