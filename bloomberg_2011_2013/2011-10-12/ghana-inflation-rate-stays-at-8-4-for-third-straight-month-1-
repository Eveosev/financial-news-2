Ghana ’s inflation rate was unchanged
for a third consecutive month in September, adding to
expectations the central bank may keep interest rates on hold.  The inflation rate stayed at 8.4 percent,  Grace Bediako , a
statistician at the  Ghana  Statistical Service, told reporters in
the capital, Accra, today. Prices declined 1.52 percent in the
month.  The Bank of Ghana left its benchmark interest rate
unchanged on Sept. 1, after lowering it twice this year, as
rising electricity and water costs threatened to boost
inflation. The cedi slumped 4.7 percent against the dollar in
September, extending its decline this year to 8.4 percent,
adding to price pressures.  “As much as the central bank will take comfort from these
numbers, the emphasis should be on the outlook,”  Razia Khan ,
head of Africa research at Standard Chartered Plc in  London ,
said in an e-mail today. “The cedi has succumbed in some
measure to the volatility that has affected other markets, and
domestic pressures are ramping up, making the inflation outlook
more worrying.”  The central bank will make its next  interest rate  decision
on Oct. 19. The cedi was little changed at 1.6319 against the
dollar as of 2:33 p.m. in Accra.  Inflation eased last month as food prices increased at a
slower pace of 3.7 percent in September from 3.9 percent a month
earlier, said Bediako.  “Barring any significant external shocks, inflation should
again record a small change in the coming month, due to the
favorable food harvest,” Bediako said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
