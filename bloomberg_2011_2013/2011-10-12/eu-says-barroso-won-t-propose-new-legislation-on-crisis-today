European Commission President  Jose
Barroso ’s plan for mastering the debt crisis won’t include
proposals for new legislation today, the commission said.  “There’s no specific new piece of legislation,”
commission spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen told reporters in
Brussels today. “That is not the objective.”  Barroso speaks to the European Parliament at 3 p.m. in
Brussels.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
