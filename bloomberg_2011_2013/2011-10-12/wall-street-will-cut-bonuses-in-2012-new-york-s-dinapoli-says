Wall Street  will cut bonuses next
year as revenue drops amid a sluggish U.S. economic recovery,
the European debt crisis and new compensation structures to curb
risk taking, New York State Comptroller  Thomas DiNapoli  said.  Bonuses are “certainly going to be lower,” DiNapoli said
today in a Bloomberg Television interview with Erik Schatzker on
“Inside Track.” Banks will have less money to pay awards, and
“you’re seeing an increase in base salary pay, and more in
terms of bonuses and incentives that are paid out over time,”
he said.  Wall Street cash bonuses fell 8 percent last year from 2009
as financial companies disbursed $20.8 billion. The average Wall
Street cash award for an employee was $128,530 in 2010, a 9
percent drop that was greater than the total decline because the
pool was shared among more workers.  After adding 9,900 jobs between January 2010 and April
2011, the securities industry cut 4,100 positions through August
and may shed an additional 10,000 jobs by the end of 2012,
DiNapoli said in a  report  released yesterday. Each job gained or
lost in the industry creates or eliminates three other jobs in
 New York  City and state, according to the report.  “When we shed jobs, over time, it will have a ripple,
negative effect on other parts of our economy,” DiNapoli said
in the interview.  The anti-Wall Street protesters in New York’s financial
district are “channeling the frustration I think many Americans
feel,” DiNapoli said.  “This is a money-maker for our city and state,” he said
referring to Wall Street. “We can argue about what’s the
appropriate level of regulation, but we want this industry to be
profitable and sustainable and to employ even more people.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
