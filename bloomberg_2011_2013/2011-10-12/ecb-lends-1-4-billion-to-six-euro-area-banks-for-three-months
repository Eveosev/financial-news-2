The  European Central Bank  said six
euro-area banks asked for three-month dollar loans in the first
of three operations.  The European lenders asked for a total of $1.353 billion in
the ECB’s 84-day dollar tender, the Frankfurt-based central bank
said in a statement today. The six banks will pay a fixed rate
of 1.09 percent for the funds. The ECB also allotted $500
million to one bank in its weekly dollar operation. The ECB
doesn’t identify the banks it lends to.  The ECB announced last month that it would coordinate with
the  Federal Reserve  and other central banks to conduct three
separate dollar liquidity operations to ensure banks have enough
of the U.S. currency through the end of the year as the
sovereign debt crisis roils money markets. The three-month loans
are in addition to the bank’s regular seven-day dollar offerings
and are fixed-rate tenders with full allotment. The next loans
will be offered on Nov. 9 and Dec. 7.  European banks need dollars to fund their own lending in
the U.S. as well as to clients elsewhere doing business in the
world’s leading reserve currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
