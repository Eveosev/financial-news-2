BankMuscat SAOG (BKMB) , Omanâ€™s biggest bank
by assets, reported an 18 percent jump in third-quarter profit,
helped by higher income from lending.  Net income advanced to 29.8 million rials ($77 million)
from 25.2 million rials a year earlier, according to Bloomberg
calculations based on nine-month  results  provided by the Muscat-
based lender. EFG-Hermes Holding SAE forecast a profit of 24
million rials, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nine-month lending increased 17 percent from a year ago to
4.54 billion rials and deposits rose 37 percent to 4.72 billion
rials, the bank said.  BankMuscat shares lost 0.3 percent to close at 0.665 rial
in Muscat today before the results were announced. The stock has
declined 21 percent this year compared with an 18 percent drop
in the benchmark Muscat Securities Market Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
