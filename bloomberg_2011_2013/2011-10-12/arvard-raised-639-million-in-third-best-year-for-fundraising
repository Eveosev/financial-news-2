Harvard University , the world’s
richest college, raised $639 million in the year ended June 30,
the third-highest annual total in its history.  The haul marked a 7 percent increase over the $597 million
that Harvard received in the same period a year earlier,
according to a statement from the university in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. Harvard has a $32 billion endowment, the biggest
in higher education.  Colleges including  Yale University  in New Haven,
Connecticut, and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
also have reported a rebound in contributions even with a
sluggish  U.S. economy .  “We are fortunate to have a dedicated community of alumni
and friends who are unwavering in their support of the
University,” Tamara Elliott Rogers, Harvard vice president for
alumni affairs and development, said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
