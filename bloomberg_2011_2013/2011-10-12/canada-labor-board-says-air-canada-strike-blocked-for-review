Air Canada (AC/A)  flight attendants were
barred from striking when the government referred their contract
dispute to a labor board.  The Industrial Relations Board received two referrals from
the Labour Ministry, asking for a review of the proposed
strikeâ€™s effect on public health and safety and whether the
attendants union had created unfavorable settlement conditions
by rejecting two contract offers.  Canada law suspends the right to strike while a health and
safety referral is being considered, the board said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
