OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel slid after
Vedomosti reported  Russia ’s largest miner may need to get
government approval for its buyback program, citing a letter
from the Russian antitrust regulator.  The shares dropped as much as 2.3 percent and closed down
0.8 percent at 6,284 rubles by 6:45 p.m. in Moscow.  Norilsk, which is carrying out the buyback through a unit
that is registered outside Russia, forms a single group with
billionaire  Vladimir Potanin ’s Interros Holding Co. that holds
more than a 10 percent stake combined, meaning it needs
permission from the government foreign investment commission to
buy the shares in Norilsk, a strategic company, the newspaper
said. Interros holds about 30 percent of the nickel producer.  “This news is negative for Norilsk shares since the
buyback was a key factor helping the share outperform,” Alfa
Bank analysts Barry Ehrlich and Andrey Lobazov, said in an e-
mailed report today. “A heightened risk of a delay to the
buyback will likely cause an underperformance until the risk is
removed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
