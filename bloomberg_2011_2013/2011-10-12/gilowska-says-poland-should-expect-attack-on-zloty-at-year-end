Polish policy makers should expect a
possible “attack on the zloty” at the end of the year as
markets test the government’s resolve to keep the public debt
below the European Union limit of 60 percent of gross domestic
product, rate setter Zyta Gilowska said yesterday in an
interview in Warsaw.  Every 10 percentage-point depreciation of the zloty would
increase Poland’s debt ratio, now at 57 percent of GDP according
to EU accounting rules, by 2 percentage points of GDP, Gilowska
said.  “This is an extremely risky situation,” she said. “We
have to assume that markets could stage an attack on the zloty,
because they know very well that the government will defend the
currency at a level that will prevent a breach of the 60 percent
limit.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
