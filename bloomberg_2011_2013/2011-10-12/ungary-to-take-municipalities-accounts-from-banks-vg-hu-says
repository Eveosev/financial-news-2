The Hungarian state treasury will
take over the accounts of local municipalities from local banks
as part of its plan to tighten control over local spending, news
portal  Vg.hu  said.  OTP Bank Nyrt., the country’s largest lender, stands to
lose the largest number of clients, according to the portal.  Hungarian local councils’ bank deposits amounted to 340.3
billion forint ($1.6 billion) at the end of June and their loans
totaled 469.9 billion forint, Vg.hu said, citing data from the
financial supervisory authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
