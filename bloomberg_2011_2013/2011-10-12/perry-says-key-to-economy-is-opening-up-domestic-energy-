Texas Governor  Rick Perry  called for
expanded U.S. energy production as a way to invigorate the
nation’s economy, criticizing regulations he says have “put our
 energy industry  and the rest of our economy in jeopardy.”  Perry said he would “pull back” other federal regulations
“that are strangling the economic entrepreneurship that’s out
there.”  Perry spoke at a debate sponsored by Bloomberg LP and The
Washington Post in Hanover,  New Hampshire .  To contact the reporter on this story:
