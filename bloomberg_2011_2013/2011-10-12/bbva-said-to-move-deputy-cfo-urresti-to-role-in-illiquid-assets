Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
 Spain ’s second-biggest bank, is moving Deputy Chief Financial
Officer Pedro Urresti to a new role where he’ll help manage the
lender’s illiquid assets including real estate, according to two
people with knowledge of the situation.  Urresti will help oversee assets such as property loans
acquired during Spain’s real-estate boom and non-performing
debt, said the people, who declined to be identified before an
announcement is made.  A spokesman for the Bilbao, Spain-based bank, who wouldn’t
be named citing internal policy, confirmed that Urresti will
lead a new project, while saying that his exact role is yet to
be defined.  BBVA hired Erik Schotkamp from Dutch pension manager APG
Algemene Pensioen Groep NV to share Urresti’s old
responsibilities with Antonio Borraz, the spokesman said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
