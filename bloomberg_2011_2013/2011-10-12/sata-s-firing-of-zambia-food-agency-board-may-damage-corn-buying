Zambia’s President  Michael Sata ’s
decision to fire the chief executive officer of the Food Reserve
Agency and disband its board will affect corn purchases, said
Lazarus Mawele, the agency’s fired deputy chief executive
officer.  “Clearly there will be an impact on the purchase of maize
lying around the country uncollected right now,” Mawele said by
phone today from Lusaka, the capital. “I think things might be
made worse by the fact that the rainy season has now started and
the maize risks rotting.”  Mawele, who was in charge of purchasing the 3 million
metric tons of corn harvested this year, said the agency had
bought about 1.5 million tons of corn before the management and
board were fired. Corn is known in  Zambia  as maize.  Sata has fired several officials since he beat incumbent
President Rupiah Banda in an election last month, including the
head of the anti-corruption agency and revenue authority’s board
in a campaign against corruption. He also removed Caleb Fundanga
as central bank governor.  The food agency’s new managers will struggle to organize
the logistics to collect the corn, Mawele said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
