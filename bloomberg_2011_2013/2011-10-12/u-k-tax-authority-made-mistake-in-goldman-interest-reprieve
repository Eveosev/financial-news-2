Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs,
the U.K. tax authority, “made a mistake” in granting  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  a reprieve on the interest it owed on bonus
payments, HMRC Permanent Secretary for Tax David Hartnett said.  The U.K.’s most senior tax official was answering questions
from a parliamentary committee on his role in an agreement with
Goldman in December, which resulted in the U.S. investment bank
paying tax it owed but foregoing interest payments.  The reprieve was worth “less than 10 million pounds” to
Goldman Sachs, Hartnett said. He declined to elaborate further,
citing tax confidentiality rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
