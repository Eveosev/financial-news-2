Boston  Red Sox  General Manager Theo Epstein is close to joining the Chicago Cubs, the Boston Herald
reported, citing people familiar with the situation.  The Red Sox want to keep Epstein or receive compensation
from the Cubs if he chooses to leave, the Herald said. It was
unclear whether Boston would want money, a Major League Baseball
player or a combination of the two for Epstein, the newspaper
said.  Epstein, 37, joined the Red Sox in 2002, becoming the
youngest general manager in baseball history at the age of 28.
The Red Sox won  World Series  in 2004 and 2007 and made the
playoffs in six of his nine seasons.  The Red Sox blew a nine-game lead for the American League
wild-card spot in the final month of play this season. Manager
Terry Francona left after  Boston  failed to make the playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
