The City Council of Harrisburg,
 Pennsylvania , facing a state takeover of its finances, sought
Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection.  Jason Hess, the acting city attorney, told the council
members before the vote today that they didn’t follow procedure
and their action would be nonbinding. The members went ahead
anyway, voting 4-3.  The city’s filing was faxed to a  bankruptcy court  in the
Middle District of Pennsylvania after the council meeting,  Mark
D. Schwartz, a lawyer the panel hired to handle the case, said
in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
