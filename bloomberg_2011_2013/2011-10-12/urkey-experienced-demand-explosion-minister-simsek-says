Turkey  experienced an “explosion”
in domestic demand this year and an extraordinary increase in
investment, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said.  Economic growth would have been 15.6 percent in the first
half if net exports were excluded, Simsek said in a speech in
Istanbul today. The economy is now slowing and the current
account deficit, which reached unsustainable proportions, will
narrow, Simsek said.  The current account gap has peaked at 9.5 percent of gross
domestic product and will decline to below that level by the end
of the year, Simsek said. The deficit is expected to fall
further in 2012, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
