Ireland may need to increase its
planned 3.6 billion euro budget adjustment by 400 million euros
in 2012 to reach its deficit target, according to the Irish
Fiscal Advisory Council.     Irish Energy Minister Pat Rabbitte said late yesterday the
government “reckoned” that 3.6 billion euros of spending cuts
and tax rises in 2012 will be enough to reach the deficit target
of 8.6 percent of gross domestic product.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
