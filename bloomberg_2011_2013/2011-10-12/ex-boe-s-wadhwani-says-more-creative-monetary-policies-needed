Former Bank of England policy maker
Sushil Wadhwani said global central banks need to do “more
creative” forms of monetary policy to prevent the global
economy slipping into a recession.  “Policymakers need to do three things if they are to
prevent a relapse,” Wadhwani said in an e-mailed note co-
written with  Michael Dicks . “First, they need to get firms
better access to credit. Second, they need to help boost demand.
And, third, they need to deal with the euro crisis.”  Wadhwani, founder of Wadhwani Asset Management LLP,
recommended U.K. authorities take a more direct approach to
boosting demand by issuing every adult a voucher that can be
spent in the next three months. That is “surely a more
effective form of quantitative easing” than the central bank
buying gilts, he said.  On  Europe ’s debt crisis, he said the U.K. and the U.S.
can’t afford to “play the innocent bystander and plead with
Europe to sort out its mess.”  “Better surely to recognise both the global scale of the
problem and the political constraints that are currently
limiting European policymakers’ room for manoeuvre, and act
in accordance,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
