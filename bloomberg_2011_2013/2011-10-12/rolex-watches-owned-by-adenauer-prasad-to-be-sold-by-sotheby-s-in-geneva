Sotheby’s (BID)  will auction Rolex
wristwatches that belonged to Konrad Adenauer, the first
chancellor of  West Germany , and Rajendra Prasad, the first
president of  India , next month.  Sotheby’s is offering more than 270 lots estimated to be
worth more than 8 million Swiss francs ($8.9 million) in its
Nov. 13 watch auction in Geneva, the auctioneer said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Prasad’s 18 karat pink gold Oyster has a face that’s
decorated with the map of India. The estimate is $222,000 to
$444,000. The sale also includes a French watch made about 1574,
timepieces for Chinese buyers in the 18th and 19th centuries,
and watches for the Ottoman and Spanish markets.  Sotheby’s will also auction a one-of-a-kind Patek Philippe
reference 1518 chronograph with a so-called perpetual calendar
that adjusts for leap years. That watch is estimated at $890,000
to $1.33 million, Sotheby’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
