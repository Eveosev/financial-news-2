Paz Corp SA (PAZ) ,  Chile ’s second-largest
publicly traded home builder by sales, posted a record two-day
gain after its valuation dropped to the lowest in three years.  Paz surged 18 percent to 239.26 pesos at 4:21 p.m. Santiago
time, bringing the two-day gain to 33 percent. Volume was more
than five times the average of the last three months. Chile’s
stock market was closed for a holiday on Oct. 10.  The stock began gaining after its price-to-earnings ratio
fell to 7.8 on Oct. 7, the lowest since September 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It currently trades at
10.3 times trailing earnings. That compares to a ratio of 15.6
for the benchmark Ipsa index. Paz’s price-to-book ratio is 0.9.  Paz “has been overly punished, even more than other home
builders and construction companies,” Hernan Campos, head of
research at Santiago-based wealth management firm Wac
Inversiones, said in a phone interview. “Investors simply see a
bargain, even as growth estimates for the construction sector
aren’t very good.”  Shares dropped 66 percent this year through last week,
while the Ipsa stock index fell 21 percent.  Paz knows of no extraordinary event or news that may
explain the variation in price over the past two days, the
company said in a statement posted today on the website of the
Santiago stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
