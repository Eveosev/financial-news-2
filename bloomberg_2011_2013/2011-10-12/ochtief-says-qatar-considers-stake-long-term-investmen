Hochtief AG (HOT)  said Qatar Holding
Luxembourg II has notified it that its acquisition of voting
rights is a long-term investment. Qatar plans to acquire further
voting rights within the next 12 months which may be implemented
by way of purchases of voting shares or by other means. Qatar
doesn’t plan to influence appointments to Hochtief’s boards and
doesn’t aim at a capital structure change to the company.  Qatar held 10.000001 percent in Hochtief as of Sept. 28,
Hochtief said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
