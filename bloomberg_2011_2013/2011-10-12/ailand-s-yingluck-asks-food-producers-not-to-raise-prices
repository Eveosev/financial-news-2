Thai Prime Minister Yingluck
Shinawatra urged food producers not to raise prices as flooding
cuts production and residents rush to stock up on staple goods.  “I want to beg and ask for cooperation from all
producers,” Yingluck told reporters in Bangkok. “Today people
are suffering. Please sell products at appropriate prices. If
you raise product prices, people will try to stockpile more
food, which will create more problems.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
