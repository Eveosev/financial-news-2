Chile ’s peso posted its biggest
winning streak in more than two years, reaching a three-week
high as copper rose on investor optimism that  Europe  will
contain its debt crisis.  The peso strengthened 2 percent to 499.21 per dollar,
pushing through 500 per dollar for the first time since Sept.
21. The currency has gained 6.3 percent in the past week, the
most among 25 major emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg and the most for any five-day period since June 2009.  The price of copper, Chile’s principal export, has gained
13 percent to $3.3955 a pound for December delivery from a low
of $2.994 reached on Oct. 3 at the Comex in  New York . French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
vowed after a meeting on Oct. 9 to recapitalize European banks.  “The news about recapitalization of banks at the weekend
has brought more confidence,” said Matias  Madrid , chief
economist at Banco Penta in Santiago. “The copper price is now
above $3.30 again. Those are the two factors driving this.”  Foreign investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
trimmed their net long dollar position against the peso to $6.1
billion on Oct. 7 from $6.5 billion on Oct. 6, according to
central bank data.  Chile’s benchmark interest rate will fall to 4.5 percent
next September from 5.25 percent now, according to the median
forecast of 59 economists in a central bank survey published
today. Interest-rate swap rates are pricing in steeper rate cuts
than that.  The one-year interest-rate swap at 4.43 percent implies
traders expect the average central  bank rate  between Oct. 14
2011 and Oct. 14, 2012, to be about that level, lower than the
economists’ projections.  Bond Yields  Increased confidence has led to a selloff in Chilean
central bank and government bonds as investors seek out higher
yielding assets. The yield on a basket of five-year inflation-
linked central bank bonds rose 19 basis points to 2.14 percent
today. The yield has increased from 1.76 percent on Oct. 4.
Interest-rate swap rates also climbed.  The two-year swap rate rose 9 basis points to 4.26 percent.
The three-year swap rate in pesos jumped 14 basis points to 4.41
percent. Inflation-linked swap rates also climbed. The one-year
inflation-linked swap increased 13 basis points to 2.04 percent.  Market Mood  “The big driver has been the better international
scenario,” said Sebastian Ide, a fixed-income trader at  Banco
Santander Chile (BSAN)  in Santiago. “The market mood has been better
than last week. We have seen flows from active investors closing
positions in Chilean  interest rates  and the curve has given back
quite a lot of the  risk premium  that was there in recent
weeks.”  While 17 of 20 economists in Bloomberg’s survey expect the
central bank to hold rates unchanged at its meeting tomorrow,
Larrain Vial SA chief economist Leonardo Suarez forecasts a 50
basis-point cut to 4.75 percent. Larrain Vial expects the
benchmark rate to fall below 3 percent in March 2012, economists
wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  Chile’s central bank sold $328 million of 10-, 20- and 30-
year inflation-linked bonds.  The 10-year bonds paid a yield of 2.35 percent, the bank
said today on its website. The 20-year bonds paid 2.75 percent,
and the 30-year bonds paid 2.9 percent.  Banks bought 72 percent of the 10-year bonds while pension
funds and others bought all of the 20-year bonds and 98 percent
of the 30-year bonds. The 10-year bonds were 179 percent
subscribed, the 20-year bonds were 194 percent subscribed and
the 30-year bonds were 193 percent subscribed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
