India ’s 10-year bonds fell, driving
yields toward a three-year high, as a government report this
week may show inflation was near a 13-month peak in September.  The wholesale-price index rose 9.75 percent last month,
according to the median estimate of 20 economists in a Bloomberg
survey before the data is released on Oct. 14. That compares
with a 9.78 percent gain in August that was the most since July
2010. The  Reserve Bank of India  has boosted borrowing costs 12
times since the start of last year to help quell rising prices.  “More rate increases may be in store,” said Krishnamurthy Harihar, treasurer at FirstRand Ltd. in Mumbai. “Inflation
remains sticky and that has to be tackled.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.74 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. It
reached 8.75 percent on Oct. 10, the highest for a benchmark 10-
year bond since August 2008.  The yield has climbed 30 basis points since the  finance
ministry  increased its bond-sale target by 32 percent for the
fiscal year ending March 2012 on Sept. 29.  Reserve Bank  Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said in Jaipur
today that inflation still remains high. The next central bank
policy review is on Oct. 25.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose 10 basis points to 8.07 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
