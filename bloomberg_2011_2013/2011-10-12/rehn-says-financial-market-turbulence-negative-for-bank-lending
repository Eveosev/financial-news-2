European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said financial market turbulence
arising from the euro area’s debt crisis is impinging on bank
lending.  “The financial market turbulence which stems from the
sovereign debt crisis is having very negative ramifications on
the banking sector and its lending capacity and even more
important, taking a very heavy toll on economic growth and  job
creation  in  Europe ,” Rehn told the European Parliament in
Brussels today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
