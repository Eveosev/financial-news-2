Prime Minister  David Cameron  called
on U.K. companies to speed up moves to appoint more female
directors, as a progress report showed they’re falling short of
a target set by a government-appointed panel.  Women accounted for 22.5 percent of board appointments made
by companies in the FTSE 250 index since the committee called in
February for a third of all new directors to be female,
according to the report published today by Cranfield University.
Of 93 board appointments, 21 were women.  “I want more to see more companies setting out their plans
for women on boards and driving this forward,” Cameron said in
a statement issued by his office in  London  today. “Important
steps forward have been made. But there is still a long way to
go to encourage the best to rise to the top of industry,
regardless of their background or gender.”  The review, led by  Mervyn Davies , the ex-chairman of
Standard Chartered Plc, recommended that companies in the
benchmark FTSE 100 index double the proportion of women on their
boards to 25 percent. Shareholders should hold companies to
account if they fail to appoint more women, it said.  Britain’s accounting regulator, the  Financial Reporting
Council , said yesterday it will require companies to report each
year what steps have been taken to implement their boardroom-
diversity policies and explain failures to comply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
