The Progressive Conservative
government led by Kathy Dunderdale won a renewed majority in
Newfoundland and Labrador,  Canada ’s easternmost province.  Unofficial results posted yesterday showed the
Conservatives winning 37 of 48 districts with 56 percent of the
vote. While the Liberals won six seats with 19 percent of the
vote to maintain official opposition status, leader Kevin
Aylward was defeated in his own district. The  New Democratic
Party  under Lorraine Michael won the other five seats with 25
percent of the vote.  The result marks the first time a woman has been elected as
premier of a Canadian province. Dunderdale took over in December
last year after former Premier Danny Williams stepped down. Both
Christy Clark of British Columbia and Alison Redford of  Alberta 
became premier after former leaders quit.  At  dissolution , the Progressive Conservatives held 43 seats
in the Newfoundland legislature, the Liberals had four and the
 New Democrats  had one.  Moody’s Investors Service said in a report last week that
the province has seen a steady improvement in its public
finances linked to the development of its offshore oil industry.
Moody’s rates Newfoundland’s debt Aa2, with a stable outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
