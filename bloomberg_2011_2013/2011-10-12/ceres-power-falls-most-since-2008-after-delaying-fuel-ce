Ceres Power Holdings Plc (CWR)  fell the
most in almost three years in  London  trading after it delayed
until 2014 the commercial introduction of its fuel cells for
homes. Its loss widened.  Ceres fell 19 percent to 25.25 pence, the biggest decline
since Dec. 19, 2008.  David Pummell, who was named chief executive officer last
month, said today in a Regulatory News Service statement that
Ceres’s fuel cells won’t be commercially available until the
first half of 2014. The Horsham, England-based company said in
March 2010 that they would be available in the second half of
this year. The cells provide heat and power for homes.  The company’s loss for fiscal 2011, ending June 30, widened
to 13.8 million pounds ($21.7 million) from 11.7 million pounds
a year earlier.  “The product has had teething problems and Ceres went two
months without a CEO,” Jefferies analyst Gerard Reid wrote in a
note to investors. “The company will need to raise more equity
than we had expected over the next years.” Peter Bance resigned
as CEO in June.  Ceres has 26.7 million pounds in cash and will need to
raise more funding during the next year, Chairman Brian Count
said in the statement. The company “is likely to continue to
incur losses at the operating level,” he said.  Ceres in March said its products had experienced
reliability and durability problems.  “Significant progress” has been made in fixing the
problems since then and a second trial is scheduled for the
second half of next year, Pummell said. The company is seeking
to gain a share of the U.K. boiler market and is working with
partners in  North America ,  Asia  and elsewhere in  Europe , he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
