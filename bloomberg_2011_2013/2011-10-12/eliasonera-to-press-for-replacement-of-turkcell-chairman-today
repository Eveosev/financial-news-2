TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  will press for the
replacement of Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS Chairman  Colin
Williams  at a meeting of the unit’s shareholders today, said
 Cecilia Edstroem , spokeswoman for TeliaSonera.  Teliasonera welcomes a legal change yesterday requiring
Turkey’s largest companies to fill one-third of seats on their
boards with independent members, Edstroem said by telephone today
from Istanbul prior to the start of the meeting.  The three companies that control Turkcell - TeliaSonera,
Russia’s Alfa Group and Cukurova Holding AS of Turkey - are in a
dispute over control of Turkcell.   The shareholders meeting was called for today after two 
previous scheduled meetings failed to agreee on a dividend payout
and resolve a dispute over the board's makeup. TeliaSonera and Alfa
say Williams, who was appointed as independent chairman, should be 
replaced because he sides with Cukurova and an additional two
independent members should be appointed.   To contact the reporter on this story:
