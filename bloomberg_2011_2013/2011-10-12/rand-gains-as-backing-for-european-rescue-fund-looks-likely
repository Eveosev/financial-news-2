The rand strengthened, reversing an
earlier decline, as European plans to tackle its sovereign-debt
crisis helped ease concern for the global economic recovery.
   South Africa ’s currency advanced 0.4 percent to 7.8829 per
dollar by 8:55 a.m. in Johannesburg. Earlier, the currency
traded 0.8 percent lower at 7.9759. Bonds advanced, with 10-year
bond yields declining 2.6 basis points, or 0.026 percentage
points, to 8.061 percent.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said backing for the
European Financial Stability Facility should be in place by Oct.
23. The EFSF was rejected by Slovakia yesterday, the last of the
17 euro-zone members to approve the mechanism. Slovakia’s
parliament is expected to approve  Europe ’s enhanced bailout plan
in its second vote, European Union Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said.  “It’s all now down to the politicians and what they
conjure up,” David Gracey, head of currency and derivatives
trading at Investec Bank Ltd. said by phone. “We are going to
see volatility until we get some resolution as far as the
European vote is concerned. Until we get some clarity, we are
really not ready to call the direction one way or another.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
