Mexico ’s central bank is
“unlikely” to cut its benchmark lending rate this week after
the peso weakened against the dollar, Credit Suisse Group AG
economist  Alonso Cervera  said today in an e-mailed research
note.  Cervera had previously forecast a 25 basis point cut to
4.25 percent in a note sent last month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
