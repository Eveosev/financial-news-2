Ethanol declined for the first time
in three days as corn prices fell from yesterday, when the grain
advanced the most since June 2010.  The biofuel declined 0.1 percent in Chicago after the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  reported that corn inventories will be
29 percent larger than forecast last month. Corn, the primary
ingredient in U.S.-made ethanol, is the nation’s largest crop,
valued at $66.7 billion last year, according to USDA data.  “I’m surprised it didn’t pull back more,” Jim Damask, a
manager at BiofuelsConnect, a Jupiter, Florida-based alternative
energy broker, said by telephone. “A four-cent or five-cent
pullback on corn probably is pretty normal after what we saw
yesterday.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery fell 0.3 cent to
settle at $2.627 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Yesterday, it gained the most since July 5.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 4.25 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $6.4075 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York fell 1 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $2.825 a gallon, and on the West Coast the
biofuel added 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.855, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf fell 12.5 cents, or 4.5 percent,
to $2.65 a gallon, and in Chicago the additive declined 1.5
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.675, Bloomberg data show.  Gasoline for November delivery rose 0.11 cent to settle at
$2.7487 a gallon in New York. The contract covers reformulated
gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
