The ruble climbed to the strongest
level against the dollar in almost four weeks on optimism  Europe 
will ease its sovereign-debt crisis, boosting demand for
Russia’s exports.  The Russian currency rose 1.4 percent to 31.1125 per dollar
and gained 0.2 percent to 42.9175 per euro by the 7 p.m. close
in Moscow, leaving it up 0.8 percent at 36.4248 against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket. Investors pared bets
the Russian currency would weaken further, with non-deliverable
forwards showing it at 31.5540 per dollar in three months.  Global currencies and commodities rallied as European
Commission President  Jose Barroso  called for a reinforcement of
crisis-hit banks, the payout of a sixth loan to  Greece  and a
faster start for a permanent rescue fund to master Europe’s debt
woes. Urals crude oil,  Russia ’s main export blend, climbed 2.5
percent to $110.79 per barrel.  Russia’s dollar Eurobond due 2020 advanced, pushing the
yield down 17 basis points to 4.879 percent. The yield on
government dollar debt due 2015 was down 31 basis points at
3.467 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
