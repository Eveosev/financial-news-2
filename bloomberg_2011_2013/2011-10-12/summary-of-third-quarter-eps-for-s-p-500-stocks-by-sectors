Here are the cumulative earnings per share
results for the third quarter of 2011 for Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index

outstanding and market capitalization values. Share and market
capitalization percentages are year-over-year changes.  NM -- The calculations of percentage changes between profit and loss
and vice versa are not meaningful, hence not calculated.  #-- Estimates were used for those companies that have not yet reported
