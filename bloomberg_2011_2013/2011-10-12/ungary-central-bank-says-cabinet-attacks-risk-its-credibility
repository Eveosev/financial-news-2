Hungary ’s central bank said
government accusations of business mismanagement at the bank are
“baseless” and threaten the  Magyar Nemzeti Bank ’s “authority
and professional credibility.”  The central bank’s finances are “fully compliant with the
rules concerning the legal and decent management of public
funds,” the Budapest-based bank said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Gyula Budai, a government commissioner in charge of
investigating the financial activities of officials during
previous administrations, accused the central bank of having
signed illegal contracts, state news agency MTI said today,
citing his statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
