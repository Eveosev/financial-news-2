The  International Energy Agency  cut
forecasts for global oil demand in 2012 for a second month as
the economic recovery loses momentum.  The Paris-based adviser reduced estimates for world demand
for next year by 210,000 barrels a day, to 90.5 million a day in
its monthly oil market report. That means consumption will
increase by 1.3 million barrels a day, or 1.4 percent, from this
year. Oil inventories in industrialized nations fell below their
five-year average for the first time in more than three years,
according to the IEA.  “The risks lie to the downside,”  David Fyfe , head of the
IEA’s industry and markets division, said in an interview with
Maryam Nemazee on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse.” There is
“still robust growth but it’s being affected by this economic
slowdown.”  Brent oil futures in London have lost 12 percent from this
year’s peak, trading at about $111 a barrel today, as the global
recovery fades and  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis rattles
investors. The agency sees “significant downside risks” to
expectations for world economic growth in 2012, lowered last
month by the  International Monetary Fund  to 3.9 percent.  Fragile Prospects  “Economic prospects remain fragile, particularly with the
euro zone’s ongoing sovereign debt crisis,” the IEA said today.
“Global oil demand has grown at a moderate, but stable pace in
recent months. The picture could deteriorate, however, with a
downward lurch in economic prospects,”  This year world oil demand will increase by 1 million
barrels a day, or 1.1 percent, to 89.2 million a day, following
a downward revision of 50,000 barrels, according to the agency.  The reductions are “just in line with everyone’s
expectations,” Timothy Guinness, chief executive officer of
Guinness Atkinson Asset Management in  London , said in a separate
interview on the same program. The “absolutely key factor in
determining where the oil price will be in the next 12 to 24
months is the behavior of  Saudi Arabia  and their fellow Middle
Eastern states.”  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will need
to provide an average of 30.8 million barrels a day in the
fourth quarter, according to the IEA. That’s about 300,000 a day
more than the agency estimated in last month’s report. OPEC
pumped 30.15 million a day in September.  Sabotage Attacks  OPEC members pumped less crude in September as Saudi Arabia
cut its production from the 30-year high achieved in August and
 Nigeria ’s output was hindered by sabotage attacks, the IEA said.
Daily supply from the organization’s 12 members fell from 30.17
million in August, the agency said.  The decline was partly offset by the resumption of Libyan
production, the IEA said. Libyan output averaged 75,000 barrels
a day and could approach 600,000 barrels by year-end, it said.  Oil stockpiles held by companies in the OECD declined by
3.4 million barrels to 2.69 billion in August, or about 58.4
days worth of consumption, as Asian refiners boosted operating
rates, according to the agency. Inventories slipped below their
five-year average for the first time since June 2008, according
to the report.  The IEA trimmed estimates for supplies from outside OPEC
next year by 200,000 barrels a day. Non-OPEC producers such as
Russia, Brazil and  Canada  will boost output in 2012 by 900,000
barrels a day to 53.6 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
