Ghana ’s economy may expand 13.6
percent this year, as oil output boosts the contribution of
industrial production to the gross domestic product.  The provisional estimate, which is based on data for the
first nine months of the year, compares with 7.7 percent in
2010, according to a statement handed to reporters by the  Ghana
Statistical Service . West  Africa ’s second-biggest economy after
 Nigeria  is valued at 56.3 billion cedis ($34.5 billion) at
current prices, the agency said in the statement.  Industry, which includes manufacturing, mining and
quarrying and oil, will grow 36 percent in 2011, compared with
5.6 percent in 2010, it said.  The forecast means  Ghana  may miss the target of 14.4
percent made by the Finance Ministry in a supplementary budget
announced in July, said Joe Abbey, an economist at Accra-based
 Centre for Policy Analysis . The rate is even “a shade higher
than what we would have expected, because oil production levels
are supposed to be delayed,” Abbey said by phone today.  Output at the Jubilee oil field, which made Ghana the
newest oil exporter in Africa, will not reach a production
target of 120,000 barrels a day by the end of the year,
according to the  Finance Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
