Irish home loan arrears will rise
further after a “dramatic” increase in the last two years,
according to a government-appointed group.  Some 55,000 mortgage accounts are in arrears of more than
90 days, with another 70,000 accounts restructured, the group
said in a report published today in Dublin. The group
recommended the creation of two mortgage-to-rent schemes and the
examination of split mortgages and negative equity loans.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
