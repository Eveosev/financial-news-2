Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) , the largest
U.S. auto supplier, rose as much as 6.6 percent after
forecasting per-share profit and revenue growth for the 2012
fiscal year.  Johnson Controls rose 5.7 percent to $31.86 at 11:08 a.m.
in  New York  after earlier reaching $32.13. The shares dropped 21
percent this year before today.  Profit in the year that ends Sept. 30, 2012, will be $2.85
a share to $3 a share, including 9 cents to fund pensions and
consolidate a lithium-ion battery joint venture, a gain of as
much as 23 percent from fiscal year 2011. The average estimate
of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is for a profit of $3.11 a
share, excluding the one-time items.  “The guidance of at least 20 percent earnings growth is
much better than what is priced into the stock,”  David Leiker ,
an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co. in  Milwaukee , said in an
e-mail.  Sales will be about $44.2 billion, compared with $44.6
billion, the average estimate of 20 analysts, Johnson Controls
said today before its investor day conference in New York.  Profit in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 increased to 75
cents a share, excluding some costs, compared with 60 cents a
year earlier, Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls said today in a
preliminary earnings statement. The average estimate of 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of 78 cents a
share. Sales in the quarter were $10.7 billion, compared with an
average estimate of $10.5 billion.  Improving Margins  The company said sales and margins will improve in its
three business units, and it forecast higher auto production in
 North America  and  China , while  Europe  mostly will be unchanged.  Johnson Controls received 48 percent of its $34.3 billion
in revenue in its fiscal 2010 from its auto parts unit, which
makes seats and instrument panels. Johnson Controls also makes
car batteries and systems to manage building climate and
security. The company said it plans $1.7 billion in capital
investments this year.  “The company’s long-term growth story is intact,” Chief
Executive Officer Stephen Roell said in the statement.  Johnson Controls will release full fourth-quarter results
Oct. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
