Parts of the U.S. Midwest and East
may have low temperatures in the 30s to 40s Fahrenheit (minus 1
to 4.4 Celsius) during the next two weeks, said  Matt Rogers ,
president of the Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Rogers said the Midwest may have one or two cold nights
from Oct. 17 to Oct. 21, while the cooling will reach the East
during the Oct. 22 to Oct. 26 period. Parts of the South may
also get lower temperatures next week.  “Cooler weather dropping into the Midwest, East, and South
could be the strongest so far this season, but it is still very
short-lived, just a few days,” Rogers, based in Bethesda,
Maryland, said in a note today to clients. “The biggest impact
is on low temperatures -- overnight heating demand.”  Traders use long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather can
increase demand for heating and cooling, and  power plants  use
about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  Hot weather is expected from southern  California  to the
 Rocky Mountains  throughout the 6- to 10-day and 11- to 15-day
forecasts, Rogers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
