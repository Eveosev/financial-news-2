Zain Saudi Arabia, a unit of Mobile
Telecommunications Co. of  Kuwait , posted a narrowed third-
quarter loss as it added customers and introduced 4G services.  The loss was 484 million riyals ($129 million), compared
with 544 million riyals a year earlier, the company said in a
statement to the Saudi  bourse  today. The mean estimate of five
analysts was for a loss of 378 million riyals, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Zain Saudi started on Sept. 14 a high-speed mobile Internet
network service in the three main cities of  Riyadh , Jeddah and
Dammam and will cover all of the kingdom by the end of 2012.  The loss narrowed “despite the very competitive and
saturated market conditions,” Board Chairman Prince Hussam Bin Saudi Bin Abdul Aziz said in a statement today. Revenue rose 8
percent to 1.8 billion.  Saudi Arabia ’s third-largest phone operator by market value
yesterday appointed Khalid Al-Omar as chief executive officer
after Saad al-Barrak resigned. Zain Saudi’s parent company Zain
Group last month failed to sell a 25 percent stake in its Saudi
unit to Kingdom Holding Co. and Bahrain Telecommunications Co.  Zain Saudi’s shares dropped 0.8 percent to 5.9 riyals at
11:53 a.m. in Riyadh after the results were announced. The stock
has tumbled 24 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
