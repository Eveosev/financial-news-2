It will take at least until 2015 for
the U.S. jobless rate to drop to 6 percent if the  labor force 
and employment keep growing at the current pace.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the projected path of
unemployment assuming monthly payroll gains match the 124,167
increase averaged over the past 12 months and the labor force
expands as it’s done since January 2010.  “If anything, the estimate of when we would return to the
target unemployment rate is optimistic,” said Patrick O’Keefe,
chief of economic research at JH Cohn LLP in Roseland,  New
Jersey , and a former deputy assistant secretary at the Labor
Department. “This jobs recovery is so weak that it will take
years before we get back to an unemployment rate that, prior to
the recession, would have been considered high.”  The departure from the workforce of discouraged workers,
who have stopped looking for a job and are therefore no longer
considered unemployed, is helping depress joblessness. The labor
force has grown 0.4 percent over the past 20 months.  By contrast, the  Congressional Budget Office  forecasts the
labor force will climb 0.9 percent a year through 2014. At that
rate, and with payroll growth holding at the pace of the last
year, it will be 2025 before unemployment reached 6 percent.  The  unemployment rate  has remained above 8 percent since
February 2009, the longest such stretch since record-keeping
began in 1948. The proportion of the labor force either working
or actively looking for work was 64.2 percent in September,
close to July’s 63.9 percent, which was the lowest since 1984.  To contact the reporters on this story:
