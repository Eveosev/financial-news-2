First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the largest thin-
film solar panel maker, sank to a four-year low on concern that
 Germany , the world’s biggest market for power from the sun,
won’t provide a year-end surge.  First Solar fell 3.5 percent to $53.93 at 8:31 a.m. in
premarket trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have
dropped 59 percent this year and are trading at their lowest
since March 2007.  Paul Leming, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities in New
York, downgraded First Solar to “sell” from “neutral” in a
report today because an expected surge in installations ahead of
a planned reduction in German subsidies hasn’t materialized and
further cuts may be gaining political support.  “Thin-film module prices are now at or below 90 cents per
watt, a level at which First Solar’s module manufacturing is at
best break-even after operating expenses,” Leming said in a
note to clients.  Leming reduced his 2011 profit estimate to $8 a share from
$8.23 a share, and for 2012 to $6.30 from $7 a share. He expects
2013 earnings will fall short of that and initiated a 12-month
price target of $40 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
