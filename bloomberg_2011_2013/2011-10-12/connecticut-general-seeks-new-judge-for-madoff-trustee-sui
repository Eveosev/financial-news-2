Connecticut General Life Insurance
Co. asked a district judge to review a $15 million lawsuit by
the liquidator of  Bernard Madoff ’s firm, saying the suit was one
of many against innocent investors in the Ponzi scheme that
demands “vast sums of money” that the Madoff estate isn’t
legally entitled to.  The insurer cited recent rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court
and district courts in support of its argument that trustee
 Irving Picard ’s clawback suits raise issues that are beyond the
power of a bankruptcy judge to decide, according to a court
filing today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
