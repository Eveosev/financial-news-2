Sweden ’s central bank will keep its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 2 percent in the next 12
months and raise it to 2.3 percent in two years, according to a
survey of money market participants commissioned by the bank.  Consumer prices will rise 1.9 percent in the next 12 months
and 2.1 percent the following year, according to the survey
published today by  TNS Sifo Prospera  on its website. The Swedish
economy will grow 2 percent in the next 12 months and 2.2
percent the following year, the survey showed.  The Stockholm-based Riksbank kept its benchmark lending
rate unchanged at 2 percent last month and scaled back
tightening plans as weakening growth prospects abroad hurt
Swedish output, of which half is sold abroad.  “This autumn we’ll see the Riksbank revise downward and
flatten their repo path,” Anders Brunstedt, an analyst at
 Svenska Handelsbanken AB (SHBA) , said in a note yesterday after
inflation last month slowed more than analysts estimated. Price
increases will slow and the rate will fall to 2 percent by the
end of the year, he said.  The central bank, which targets a 2 percent inflation rate,
sees consumer prices rising 3 percent this year before slowing
to 2.1 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
