Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt
Romney said his economic plan calls for cutting  capital gains 
tax rates for middle-class taxpayers because they are the people
“who are hurting the most.”  In a debate among Republican presidential candidates,
former House Speaker  Newt Gingrich  questioned Romney’s proposal
for restricting lower capital gains taxes to people making less
than $200,000 a year. Wealthier Americans get most of the
capital gains, Gingrich said.  “I’m not worried about rich people, they’re doing just
fine,” Romney said.  The candidates spoke at a debate sponsored by Bloomberg LP
and The Washington Post in Hanover, New Hampshire.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
