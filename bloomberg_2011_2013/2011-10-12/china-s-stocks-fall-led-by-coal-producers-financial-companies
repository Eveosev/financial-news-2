China ’s stocks rallied, spurring the
biggest gain for the benchmark index in a year, on speculation
the government is seeking to bolster the share market after
valuations dropped to record low levels.  Haitong Securities Co. led a rally for brokerages after
Xinhua News Agency reported regulators approved cross-border
exchange-traded funds. China Minsheng Banking Corp. surged the
most in seven weeks as banks extended yesterday’s rally after
Central Huijin Investment Ltd. began buying shares of lenders.
Trainmakers CSR Corp. and China CNR Corp. rose more than 4
percent after the 21st Century Business Herald reported their
parent companies may get cash injections from the government.  The Shanghai Composite Index advanced 71 points, or 3
percent, to 2,420 at the close, the most since Oct. 15, 2010.
The CSI 300 Index gained 3.6 percent to 2,644.76.  “ Central Huijin ’s move was a flash point, boosting
investors’ confidence and buying sentiment,” said Wu Kan, a
 fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Insurance Co. which manages
$285 million. “The government’s move fueled speculation that
China’s stocks are undervalued.”  The Shanghai Composite has tumbled 14 percent this year,
driving down estimated price earnings to 11.2 times, compared
with the record low of 10.8 times set on Oct. 10, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Stocks have fallen after the
government raised  interest rates  and reserve-requirement ratios
for banks to cool inflation that’s at the highest level in
almost three years.  Inflation probably eased to 6.1 percent in September from
6.2 percent in August, according to the median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg survey. The data are scheduled to be
released Oct. 14. Consumer prices rose 6.5 percent in July.  Cross-Border ETFs  A gauge of financial companies in the CSI 300 surged 4.5
percent, the most among the 10 industry groups.  Haitong Securities surged 0.81 yuan to 8.87 yuan, the
biggest percentage gain since December 2008. Citic Securities
Co., the nation’s biggest listed brokerage, gained 6.2 percent
to 11.92 yuan.  The China Securities Regulatory Commission has approved
cross-border exchange-traded funds, Xinhua reported, citing an
unidentified person. ETFs mimic the performance of an index and
trade like stocks. Chinese investors may benefit from the
exchanges’ plans to introduce ETFs tracking overseas indexes
they currently have limited access to foreign stocks.  Banks Extend Rally  China Minsheng jumped 4.9 percent to 5.76 yuan.  Industrial
& Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., the world’s largest bank by
market value, extended yesterday’s 1.5 percent gain, adding 1.7
percent to 4.12 yuan.  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288)  gained 2.4
percent to 2.58 yuan.  Central Huijin bought 14.6 million Shanghai-listed A shares
in ICBC, 7.38 million yuan-denominated shares of Construction
Bank, 39.1 million shares in Agricultural Bank and 3.5 million
shares in  Bank of China , the four lenders said in statements to
the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.  The Shanghai Composite jumped 21 percent in a week after
the government said it would buy shares of the three largest
lenders on Sept. 18, 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Central Huijin’s move proved to be useful in the past as
a short-term stimulus, so it still might work for the banking
industry this time,” said Zhang Han, a strategist at Guotai
Junan Securities Co.  Train Stocks  CSR rose 5.2 percent to 4.67 yuan, the first increase in
six days. China CNR gained 5.2 percent to 4.70 yuan.  CSR and China CNR’s parent companies may each receive 2
billion yuan cash injections from the government provided their
listed units complete share sales to raise money this year, 21st
Century Business Herald reported today, citing an unidentified
person familiar with the matter.  The units applied last month to the State-owned Assets
Supervision and Administration Commission for the injection to
counter cash shortages caused by tight credit, the newspaper
said.  Jiangxi Copper Co. the nation’s biggest copper producer,
advanced 3.5 percent to 27.47 yuan. Yunnan Copper Industry Co.
