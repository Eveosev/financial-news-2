France ’s inflation rate held at its
highest in almost three years in September as a weaker euro
increased the cost of dollar-priced energy products.  Consumer prices rose 2.4 percent from a year earlier based
on European Union methodology, the same as the 2.4 percent
increase in August, the Paris-based national statistics office,
Insee, said today. The reading was the highest since October
2008. Economists forecast an increase of 2.6 percent, according
to the median of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. In the
month, prices were unchanged.  With  oil prices  30 percent higher in a year and the euro
weaker, French motorists are paying more for gasoline, sapping
disposable income. The price of regular unleaded gasoline
averaged 1.51 euros ($2.05) a liter in September, up from 1.49
euros a liter in August,  according to the Energy and Environment
Ministry .  Energy prices are increasing across the euro area,
“primarily owing to the fall in the euro,” said Pierre-Olivier Beffy, an economist at Exane BNP Paribas in Paris. “This
situation is unlikely to last beyond 2011 as the economic
slowdown should rapidly impact prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
