OAO Sberbank can’t get credit from
foreign banks on terms as favorable as those of a July loan by
VTB Group,  Kommersant  reported, citing several unidentified
people familiar with the situation.  Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest lender, initially wanted to
raise $2 billion, the newspaper said, adding that the bank hoped
to agree on a loan at 130 basis points over the London interbank
offered rate and finally agreed on Libor plus 165 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
