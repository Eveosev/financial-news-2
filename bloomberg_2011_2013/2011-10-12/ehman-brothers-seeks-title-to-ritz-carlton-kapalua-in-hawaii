Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , which
lent $232.4 million for a resort in  Hawaii  in 2007, said it
intends to take title to the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua after
foreclosing on its loan, according to a court filing today.  The resort is one of the distressed real estate projects
financed by Lehman before its 2008 bankruptcy. The defunct
investment bank, which is trying to boost asset sales to help
pay creditors, valued its real estate at $13.2 billion in a
court filing detailing a $65 billion liquidation plan.  Real estate sales will run through 2014, New York-based
Lehman said in the June filing.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
