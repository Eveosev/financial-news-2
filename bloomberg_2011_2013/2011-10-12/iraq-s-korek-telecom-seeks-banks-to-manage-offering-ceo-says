Korek Telecom, part-owned by  France
Telecom SA (FTE) , is in talks with banks to manage an initial public
offering on the Iraqi bourse, Chief Executive Officer Ghada
Gebara said, declining to name them.  “We are working on the issue and our information is
confidential at the moment,” she said in a telephone interview
today.  According to their licences, Korek along with Mobile
Telecommunications Co.,  Kuwait ’s biggest mobile-phone company,
also known as Zain, as well as Asiacell, an affiliate of Qatar
Telecom QSC, were due to trade 25 percent of their shares on the
Iraq Stock Exchange by the end of August.  The three companies should also convert from a limited
liability company to a shareholding company before listing on
the stock exchange, according to regulations.  The three companies will be fined for missing the Aug. 31
deadline, Salim Mashkour, a member of the trustee board of
 Iraq ’s Communications and Media Commission, said yesterday.  “Fining us is not going to accelerate this thing, on the
contrary, it’s going to create more issues and will also put
pressure on the value of the company,” Gebara said.  Iraq has 23 million mobile-phone subscribers, according to
the Communications and Media Commission.  To contact the reporters on this story:
