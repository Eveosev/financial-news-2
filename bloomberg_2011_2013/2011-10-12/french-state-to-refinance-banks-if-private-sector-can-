France  is willing to help
recapitalize banks that are unable to tap markets, Budget
Minister Valerie Pecresse said, as the European Union prepares a
plan to support banks.  She said the French government wants a “collective,
European plan” for banks. France will not seek to borrow from
the European Financial Stability Facility to fund any eventual
bank recapitalization, Pecresse said today in Paris.  “The market turbulence is such as that augmenting the
capital of some European banks has become necessary,” Pecresse,
who is also government spokeswoman, told reporters. “We favor
private capital, but if public capital is needed, the French
state is ready to meet the demand.”  European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso will
outline a “comprehensive” set of proposals to deal with the
debt crisis later today, the commission said. The proposals will
cover coordinated bank recapitalizations across the EU, private-
sector participation in the Greek bailout, and the region’s
rescue funds, EU officials say.  To contact the reporters on this story:
