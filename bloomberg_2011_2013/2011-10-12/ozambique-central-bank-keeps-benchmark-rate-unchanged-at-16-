Mozambique â€™s central bank kept its
benchmark interest rate unchanged as economic growth in the
southern African nation slowed.  The standing lending facility rate was held at 16 percent,
the Maputo-based Bank of Mozambique said in a statement on its
website today. The rate was cut by half a percentage point on
Aug. 11. The bank also said it will intervene in the  interbank
market  to ensure that  money supply  does not exceed 33 billion
meticais ($1.22 billion) by the end of October.  Inflation in Maputo, which is tracked by the central bank,
eased to 7.8 percent in September from 7.9 percent a month
earlier, the statistics office said on Oct. 7. The metical has
gained 20 percent against the dollar this year, the best
performing currency of more than 170 currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
