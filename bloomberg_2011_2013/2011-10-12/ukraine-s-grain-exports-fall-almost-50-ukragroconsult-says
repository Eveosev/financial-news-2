Ukraine’s grain exports fell by
almost 50 percent in the first nine days this month to about
201,000 metric tons from 400,000 tons in the same period last
month, according to UkrAgroConsult.  Shipments included 50,500 tons of wheat and 150,900 tons of
corn, the researcher, which is based in the capital Kiev, said
