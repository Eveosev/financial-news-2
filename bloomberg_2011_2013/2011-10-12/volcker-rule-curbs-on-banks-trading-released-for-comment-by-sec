The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission joined three other federal regulators in seeking
comment on a rule that would bar banks from making short-term
trades for their own accounts and limit their ownership of
private-equity and hedge funds.  SEC commissioners voted 4-0 at a meeting in  Washington 
today to release the so-called Volcker rule for public comment
through Jan. 13. The  Federal Reserve , Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released the
proposal yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
