Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures fluctuated after the  International Energy
Agency  cut its 2012 global oil-demand forecast.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
December, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 41.3 percent at noon in New York,
down from 41.7 percent yesterday.  Oil for November delivery fell 16 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
$85.65 a barrel at 12:24 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Oil has dropped 6.3 percent this year.  The most active options contract in electronic trading
today was December $110 calls, with 2,462 lots changing hands as
of 12:26 p.m. The options were unchanged at 11 cents. December
$65 puts, the next-most-active contract, declined 1 cent to 37
cents on volume of 1,541. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of
crude.  The volume of calls outnumbered puts by about 52 percent to
48 percent.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  December 2012 $80 puts were the most-active options traded
in the previous session, with 8,825 lots changing hands. They
fell 41 cents to $9.67 a barrel. The next-most-active options,
