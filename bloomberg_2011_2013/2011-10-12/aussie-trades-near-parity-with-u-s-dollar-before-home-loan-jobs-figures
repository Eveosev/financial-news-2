Australia’s dollar was worth more
than its U.S. counterpart by the most in three weeks as global
stocks rose amid increased demand for riskier assets.  The Aussie gained against the yen after data showed that
home-loan approvals rose for a fifth month, adding to signs the
domestic economy remains resilient.  New Zealand ’s currency,
nicknamed the kiwi, rose against the dollar and yen as a gauge
of  house prices  rose to a 22-month high.  “The housing financing data probably helped the Aussie at
the margin,” said Jonathan Cavenaugh, a Singapore-based senior
currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp.  Australia’s dollar advanced 2.3 percent to $1.0177 U.S.
cents at 11:23 a.m. New York time, after sliding 0.9 percent
earlier. It gained 3.2 percent to 78.71 yen from yesterday, when
it fell 0.4 percent. New Zealand’s dollar strengthened 2.2
percent to 79.71 U.S. cents and 3.1 percent to 61.63 yen.  The MSCI World index of shares rose 1.6 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 1.4 percent.  The number of loans granted to build or buy houses and
apartments in  Australia  gained 1.2 percent in August from July,
when they increased a revised 1.9 percent, the statistics bureau
said in Sydney today. Economists had predicted a 1 percent
advance, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  New Zealand home prices increased in September to the
highest since November 2009, according to an index by the Real
Estate Institute. House sales climbed to 5,235 from 5,192 in
August, the Auckland-based institute said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
