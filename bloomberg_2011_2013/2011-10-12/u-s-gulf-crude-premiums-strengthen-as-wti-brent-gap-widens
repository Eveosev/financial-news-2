U.S. Gulf crude premiums increased
as the discount for West Texas Intermediate versus Brent
widened.  The gap between WTI and Brent November contracts increased
83 cents to $25.75 a barrel in  New York . The spread settled
Sept. 6 at a record margin of $26.87.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened $1.15 to
$29.50 a barrel at 12:13 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet gained $1.20 to
$29.25.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend grew 80 cents to $24.90 a barrel while Poseidon
strengthened $1.35 to $25 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium increased 50 cents to
$23.50 a barrel and West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at
70 cents a barrel. Thunder Horse’s premium increased 75 cents to
$27.25 above the benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $8.80 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at $10
a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
