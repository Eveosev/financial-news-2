Plans to revamp  China â€™s fuel-pricing
mechanism and the system for setting domestic natural-gas prices
was sent to the State Council for approval, Reuters said today,
citing an unidentified person in the industry.  Refineries will be able to break even or make a small
profit under the new fuel-pricing mechanism, Reuters said. The
new natural gas system may peg domestic prices to international
 oil prices , the news service said, without giving details.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
