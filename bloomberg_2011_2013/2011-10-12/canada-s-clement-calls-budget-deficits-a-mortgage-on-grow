Budget deficits are a “mortgage”
that must be paid down by governments to ensure economic growth,
Canada’s Treasury Board President  Tony Clement  said.  The Canadian government’s plans to cut C$4 billion ($3.9
billion) in annual spending by the fiscal year beginning April
2014 will help the nation’s recovery, Clement said.  “We want to ensure that we can continue to invest in the
priorities of Canadians and that the economy can continue to
grow and create jobs,” Clement said in the prepared text of a
speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in  Washington . “That’s
also why we launched our deficit reduction action plan.”  He said Canada’s elimination of its budget deficit in the
1990s was one of the factors that allowed the country to handle
the 2008 global slump better than others.  “We learned that deficits are a mortgage on future
economic growth that create higher taxes for our kids and our
grandkids,” said Clement, whose  department  is leading the
spending review.  Asked after his speech whether  Canada  was trying to tell
the U.S. how to handle its budget, Clement said, “It is
important that we let American political leaders decide what is
best for America. All we can do is continue to show our support
and our concern.”  “My message here was just about the Canadian experience,”
he said. “If that’s helpful for political leaders to know
that’s great.”  Canada’s budget deficit was a smaller-than-forecast C$33.4
billion in the year ended March 31, the Finance Department
announced today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
