China ’s benchmark money-market rate
dropped to a seven-week low as policy makers added cash to the
financial system and demand for funds declined after last week’s
public holidays.  The People’s Bank of China injected funds into banks for an
11th week in the five-day period through Sept. 29 before
financial markets shut last week for the National Day holidays,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank kept
the yield on one-year bills unchanged at an auction yesterday.  “The availability of money is relatively good after the
central bank’s fund injections,” said Yiming Li, Beijing-based
interest-rate strategist at BOCI Securities Ltd., a unit of Bank
of China Ltd. “I don’t think the pressure on the central bank
to ease monetary policy is too big.”  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of funding
availability in the financial system, fell 86 basis points, or
0.86 percentage point, to 3.34 percent in  Shanghai , according to
a weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. The rate touched 3.2 percent earlier, the lowest level
since Aug. 24.  The central bank sold 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) of
one-year bills at a yield of 3.584 percent, according to a
statement on its website yesterday. It also sold 50 billion yuan
of seven-day  repurchase agreements  at 2.7 percent and 40 billion
yuan of 28-day repos at 2.8 percent.  The  finance ministry  sold 30 billion yuan of seven-year
bonds today at an average yield of 3.65 percent, according to a
trader at a  finance company  that is required to bid at
government debt auctions.  The one-year swap rate, the fixed cost to receive the
seven-day repurchase rate, decreased 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 3.56 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
