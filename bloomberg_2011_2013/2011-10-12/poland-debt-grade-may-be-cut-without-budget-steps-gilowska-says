Poland ’s credit rating may be cut
unless the government takes measures to narrow the budget
deficit, central bank policy maker Zyta Gilowska said.  The 2012 budget is based on “unrealistic” assumptions and
the fiscal consolidation plan of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who
led his party to a second consecutive election victory on Oct.
9, is “not credible” and public debt is getting “dangerously
close” to 60 percent of gross domestic product, Gilowska said
in an interview in Warsaw yesterday.  “Such risks, especially in the light of the European
financial situation crisis, weigh seriously on Poland’s
perception,” Gilowska said. “Without the government action
that defend Poland from the crisis effects, Poland’s credit
rating may be cut.”  Polish government debt is rated A- by Standard & Poor’s and
Fitch Ratings, putting it four steps above junk, and at A2 at
Moody’s Investors Service. The country’s rating outlook may come
under pressure unless the government presents “contingency
plans” to reduce the  budget deficit  as economic growth slows,
Jaime Reusche, an assistant vice president for sovereign risk at
Moody’s in  New York , said on Oct. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
