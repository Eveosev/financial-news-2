Indonesia ’s rupiah declined for a
fourth day, its longest losing streak in almost a month, after
the central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark interest rate
yesterday.  Bank Indonesia lowered its  reference rate  by 25 basis
points to 6.50 percent after holding it steady for seven months,
citing easing inflation. All 15 analysts in a Bloomberg survey
had predicted that the rate would stay unchanged. The currency
has slid 1.8 percent this month as foreign funds sold $55
million more Indonesian shares than they bought through
yesterday, according to exchange data.  “The rupiah is declining because of the rate cut,” said
Bambang Eko Joewono, the Jakarta-based head of the global-
markets division at PT Bank UOB Indonesia. “We have also seen
foreign investors exiting the market.”  The rupiah dropped 0.2 percent to 8,928 per dollar as of
4:10 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It slid as much as 0.6 percent earlier.  Bank Indonesia ’s foreign-exchange reserves remain above the
level considered “safe” and the central bank is selling
dollars when needed to ease volatility in the rupiah, Deputy
Governor Hartadi Sarwono said on Oct. 7.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 8.25 percent bonds
due July 2021 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 6.56 percent today, according to the Inter-Dealer Market
Association. The rate dropped for a fifth day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
