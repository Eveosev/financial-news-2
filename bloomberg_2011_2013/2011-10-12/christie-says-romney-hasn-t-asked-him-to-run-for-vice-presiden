New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
said  Mitt Romney  hasn’t asked him to be his vice presidential
running mate in the 2012 U.S. presidential race.  “It hasn’t been offered, so there’s nothing to consider,”
Christie said today in Paramus. “There are certain personalities
appropriate for being vice president. I don’t necessarily think
mine is one of them.”  Christie, 49, endorsed Romney for president yesterday in
New Hampshire prior to the Republican presidential debate. On
Oct. 4, he said he wouldn’t join the presidential race.  Christie said he is a “member of the team” and plans to
campaign for Romney, the former Massachusetts governor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
