Segolene Royal, the French 2007
Socialist presidential candidate, called on her supporters to
vote for  Francois Hollande  in the second round of her party’s
primaries, boosting his chances to win the nomination.  Royal announced her decision in a statement sent to  Agence
France-Presse  saying: “He is leading in the first round. It is
legitimate to amplify this lead.” Royal is Hollande’s former
companion and the mother of their four children.  The winner of the second round will face President Nicolas Sarkozy, should he choose to seek a second term, in the
presidential election in May 2012.  Hollande got the most votes in the first round, followed by
 Martine Aubry , whom he faces in the runoff on Oct. 16.  Royal 
faced a setback in the first round on Oct. 9, garnering only 7
percent of the vote behind lawmaker, Arnaud Montebourg, who
advocates nationalizing banks and got 17 percent of the vote.  Hollande got 39.2 percent of the 2.67 million votes, ahead
of Aubry with 30.4 percent. Montebourg, whose support could be
decisive, hasn’t said whom he’ll back. Manuel Valls, who came in
fifth, and Jean-Michel Baylet, who got 0.6 percent of the votes,
said they support Hollande.  A poll for  Le Figaro  released yesterday showed 54 percent
of voters plan to choose Hollande on Sunday, compared with 46
percent for Aubry. The survey was conducted by Paris-based
OpinionWay institute.  To contact the reporters on this story:
