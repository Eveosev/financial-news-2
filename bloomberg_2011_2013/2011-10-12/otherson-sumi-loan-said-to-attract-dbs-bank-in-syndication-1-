Motherson Sumi Systems Ltd. (MSS) ’s 370
million euro ($510 million) loan to help fund its acquisition of
an 80 percent stake in Germany’s Peguform Group has attracted
DBS Bank Ltd. in syndication, according to a person familiar
with the matter.  The facility comprises 190 million euro of acquisition
facilities, for part funding the purchase, and a 180 million
euro loan for refinancing purposes, the person said, asking not
to be identified as details are private.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  was
awarded the mandate for both facilities last month.  The transaction is structured as three loans -- a 97
million euro five-year loan, a 93 million euro five-year loan
with a put option at the end of 18 months, and a 180 million
euro loan further split into a 120 million euro term facility
due in six years and a 60 million euro revolving credit facility
due in five, the person said.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  joined as a mandated lead arranger
last month, agreeing to underwrite 135 million euros, the person
said. Export-Import Bank of  India  and  Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB)  have also
joined as mandated lead arrangers with commitments of 50 million
euros and 75 million euros respectively, the person said.  Motherson Sumi agreed to buy a stake in Peguform in July
from Cross Industries AG, which will continue to hold a 20
percent share. Peguform supplies interior and exterior products
for automotive makers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
