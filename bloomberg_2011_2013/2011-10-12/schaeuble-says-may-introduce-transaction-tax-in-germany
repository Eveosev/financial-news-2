German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said he may introduce a transaction tax in Germany as
a measure of last resort if agreement can’t be reached on such a
move in the euro region, the European Union or at the global
level. Schaeuble made his comments today in Berlin.  Schaeuble later said there’s no agreement in Chancellor
Angela Merkel’s coalition, which includes the Free Democratic
Party, on the areas in which a transaction tax would be applied,
adding that there’s resistance against the proposal in the state
of Hesse, home of the Frankfurt stock exchange, which is led by
Merkel’s  Christian Democratic Union .  To contact the reporter on this story:
