China  stocks may extend their rally
after having traded at the biggest discount to global equities
in more than five years, if history is any guide.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks the price-to-book ratios of
shares on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index and the MSCI
World Index of developed and emerging stocks since March 2006.
Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong were valued at 1.3 times
net assets on Oct. 5, compared with 1.5 times for the MSCI
counterpart, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That discount was
the biggest since March 22, 2006. The China measure traded at a
1.4 multiple yesterday, after the index rallied 2.1 percent.  The last time there was such a discount, the Hang Seng
China gauge surged 66 percent in less than 10 months through
early 2007, compared with a 12 percent advance by the MSCI index,
the data show. After the Chinese index’s multiple sank to a
record low of 1.05 on Oct. 27, 2008, the index rallied 176
percent through Nov. 16, 2009, compared with a 47 percent
advance by MSCI’s global measure.  “The market has reacted very negatively to the potential
for overheating and hard landing in China,” as well as concerns
about European debt and the  U.S. economy , said  Mark Konyn , who
helps manage about $15 billion as chief executive officer of RCM
Asia Pacific Ltd. “We look more towards the price-to-book ratio,
and believe the market is oversold and share prices have
discounted a significant number of potential negatives.”  The so-called H-share  stock index  tumbled 29 percent in the
past 12 months through Oct. 11, compared with a 6.2 percent
decline by MSCI’s gauge. Chinese stocks dropped as the
government set measures to cool inflation and amid expectations
export demand would falter. Twelve percent of global investors
in a Bloomberg poll published last month predicted economic
growth will slow to less than 5 percent within a year, a pace
unseen in the past two decades.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 17 percent over
the five days through Oct. 12, rebounding from its lowest level
since April 2009 and boosted by China’s state-run Central Huijin
Investment Ltd. buying shares of the nation’s four biggest banks.
The index’s price-to-book ratio yesterday was 43 percent less
than the five-year average of 2.5 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
