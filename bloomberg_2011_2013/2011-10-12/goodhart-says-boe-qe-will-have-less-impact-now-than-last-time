Former Bank of England policy maker
 Charles Goodhart  said the central bank’s latest round of so-
called quantitative easing will have a smaller impact than
previous stimulus conducted during the financial crisis.  Quantitative easing now will “have less effect this time
than last time,” Goodhart said in an interview with  Andrea
Catherwood  on Bloomberg Television’s “Last Word” in London
today.  He also said there was “a very strong case” to help boost
lending to small and medium-sized companies, as well as ease
requirements for first-time homebuyers who face large down
payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
