Investors should buy the euro versus
the pound, betting the 17-nation currency will appreciate to
90.70 pence, according to Nordea Bank AB.  “The single currency is rallying,” Stockholm-based
strategists Jonas Thulin, Nils Rosendahl and Alexander Wojt
wrote in an e-mailed note today. “This is against our macro-
view but could be a good opportunity as euro seems to be off for
a massive short-squeeze rally.”  The bank recommends purchasing the euro at 87.70 pence, and
exiting the trade if the shared currency weakens to 85.90 pence,
the analysts said.  The euro was little changed at 87.51 pence at 1:22 p.m. in
 London , after strengthening from a six-month low of 85.30 pence
on Sept. 12.  In a short squeeze, a lack of supply forces prices upward
and traders with short positions are forced to buy securities to
cover their positions and limit losses. The surge of buying
results in even higher prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
