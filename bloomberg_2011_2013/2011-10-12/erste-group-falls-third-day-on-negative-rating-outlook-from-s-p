CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest power utility in
the  Czech Republic , led the country’s equities higher as the
price of electricity and other commodities rallied and amid
optimism  Europe  will contain its sovereign-debt crisis.  CEZ jumped 5.5 percent to 751 koruna at the 4:24 p.m. close
in Prague, largest rally since February 2009. The PX stock
index, in which CEZ has a 21 percent weighting, increased 2.5
percent, snapping a two-day drop. Coal company New World
Resources Plc advanced 2.8 percent to 140.51 koruna, a three-
week high.  Stocks and commodities rose worldwide and the euro gained
after European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli
Rehn  said today the region is moving toward a consensus on
resolving the crisis. Slovak parties reached agreement to
approve a boosted European Financial Stability Facility this
week after lawmakers failed to pass the bill yesterday.  “European stock markets resumed growth” as “the effect
of yesterday’s rejection in Slovakia of the EFSF top-up
evaporated during the day,” Miroslav Adamkovic, an analyst at
Komercni Banka AS in  Prague , wrote in an e-mail to clients.
“CEZ was the star of the day” in Czech trading, he wrote.  Power for next-year delivery in  Germany , where CEZ exports
some of its output, increased for a third day to 56.50 euros per
megawatt-hour, headed for the highest this month. Benchmark coal
derivatives rose 0.3 percent to $120.85 a metric ton. A close at
that level would be the highest since Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
