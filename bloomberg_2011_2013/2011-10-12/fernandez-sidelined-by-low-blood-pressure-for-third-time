Argentine President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  was forced to cancel her scheduled
activities for a third time this year because of low blood
pressure, less than two weeks before she seeks re-election.  Fernandez, 58, was ordered to rest yesterday and has
cleared her schedule for today, according to a statement on her
official website. “She’s recovering well” and will resume her
activities tomorrow, Dr. Marcelo Ballesteros said in a separate
statement on the website.  Fernandez, who leads polls ahead of the country’s Oct. 23
election, had been scheduled to visit a plant owned by food
producer Molinos Rio de la Plata SA in  Buenos Aires  today. Her
spokesman, Alfredo Scoccimarro, didn’t return a phone call by
Bloomberg to his office seeking comment.  The president also canceled a trip to  Mexico  in April and
suspended official activities in Argentina for a day in January
due to low blood pressure. Fernandez succeeded her late husband,
 Nestor Kirchner , who died of a heart attack last October at the
age of 60, as president in December 2007.  In June, Fernandez canceled a planned trip to a meeting of
leaders of the Mercosur regional trade bloc in Paraguay after
falling and cutting her forehead at an event in Buenos Aires.  To contact the reporter on this story:
