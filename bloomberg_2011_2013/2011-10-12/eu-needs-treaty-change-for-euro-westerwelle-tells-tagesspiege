European Union governments must
change the treaties governing the bloc to restore its financial
stability, German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said in a
commentary published in the  Tagesspiegel  newspaper.  Deficit controls at EU level must be strengthened and the
union must be given the power to intervene in the budgets of
countries that “stray from the path of fiscal virtue,”
Westerwelle said, according to an e-mailed advance copy of his
opinion piece.  Article 126 of the EU treaty, which determines deficit
procedures against overspending members, should be altered, a
move that could be accomplished within a year, Westerwelle said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
