Lithuania ’s planned new nuclear
power plant would give a boost to the country’s economic growth,
said Finance Minister  Ingrida Simonyte .  “Projects of this size give a substantially strong boost
to gross domestic product,” Simonyte said in an interview
yesterday. “There’s strong potential for other businesses as
well.”  Lithuania picked Hitachi Ltd. together with its Hitachi-GE
Nuclear Energy Ltd. as a strategic investor and technology
supplier to construct a nuclear power plant in the Baltic
country by the end of 2020. The government is seeking to cut its
dependence on energy imports after closing the Soviet-era
Ignalina facility at the end of 2009.  “Strong interest from the investor is the best indicator
that the project is viable” financially, Simonyte said. “The
strategic investor is not only supplying the technology, it’s
also seeing benefit in the project.”  Hitachi offered its ABWR reactor technology with a proposed
capacity of 1,300 megawatts in output at the projected plant in
Visaginas, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) northeast of the
capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
