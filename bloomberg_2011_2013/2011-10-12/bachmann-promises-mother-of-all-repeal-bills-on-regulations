Minnesota Representative  Michele
Bachmann  promised to push through “the mother of all repeal
bills” to cut government regulations if she is elected
president.  Bachmann singled out President  Barack Obama ’s health-care
law as the “number one reason employers say they aren’t hiring
today.”  Bachmann spoke at a debate among Republican presidential
candidates sponsored by Bloomberg LP and The Washington Post in
