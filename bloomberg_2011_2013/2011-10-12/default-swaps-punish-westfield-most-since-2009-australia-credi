Westfield Group is being penalized
in credit markets more than global peers as the world’s biggest
mall operator faces weaker sales growth in the U.S. and at home.  In Australia, data released yesterday showed consumer
confidence has plunged 16.9 percent in the past year, while in
the U.S. an unemployment rate over 9 percent for six months will
limit retail sales growth during this year’s holiday season, the
 National Retail Federation  said this week. For Westfield, the
world’s biggest mall owner, that may increase vacancies and
lower what it can charge tenants in its two biggest markets.  “The retail environment in the U.S. is over-saturated, and
that, combined with the lack of growth, would put pressure on
Westfield,” said Justin Davey, a Sydney-based asset manager at
BT Investment Management Ltd., which has about A$13 billion ($13
billion) of fixed income assets under management. While
Westfield has managed to maintain near-full occupancy rates in
Australia, “the concern is that problems will start to appear
over a longer period of time if they don’t get the growth they
need,” he said.  Credit-default swaps on Sydney-based Westfield’s debt
climbed 264 basis points this half to 388 basis points on Oct.
5, the highest since May 2009 and the most expensive relative to
 Australia ’s benchmark corporate bond-risk index in more than two
years. Contracts on the 52-year-old company are more expensive
than an index of global real-estate investment trusts for the
first time since May 2009, Bloomberg and CMA data show.  Relative Yields  The relative yield on $1.4 billion of 5.125 percent notes
expiring in 2014 issued by Westfield rose to 266.5 basis points
yesterday from 132.5 basis points on Aug. 1, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc prices show. The spread to Treasuries on $650
million of 5.25 percent notes maturing in 2016 issued by
Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group Inc. jumped to 283.6
from 132.3 in the same period, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  Westfield spokeswoman Julia Clarke declined to comment on
the debt market pricing.  Consumer confidence  in Australia slumped to 97.20 this
month from 117 a year earlier, according to a Westpac Banking
Corp. and  Melbourne  Institute survey of 1,200 consumers taken
Oct. 3-8 and released yesterday in Sydney.  “The fall in the Australian dollar had a significant
impact on sentiment towards buying a major household item,”
Westpac Chief Economist  Bill Evans  said in the report. “Global
equity markets were also weak with the Australian share market
falling by around 8 percent between surveys.”  Australian Dollar  The Australian dollar has declined about 8 percent versus
its U.S. counterpart since peaking on July 27, and the benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 index has fallen 14 percent its 2011 high on April
11. The so-called Aussie, the world’s fifth-most traded
currency, advanced to $1.0184 as of 2:44 p.m. in Sydney, from
$1.0159 yesterday in  New York .  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia, at its policy meeting on
Oct. 4, cited a “softer” labor market and consumers who are
“more concerned about the possibility of unemployment rising,”
as it kept rates unchanged at 4.75 percent for an 11th straight
month.  The nation’s  unemployment rate  declined in September for
the first time since March to 5.2 percent. Still, monthly
employment growth in Australia averaged 4,600 from January
through September, compared with an average of 31,422 in the
first nine months of 2010.  Interest Rates   Traders are betting RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  will reduce
the key rate by 113 basis points over the next 12 months, down
from 161 on Oct. 4, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG index
based on swaps.  The 10-year bond yield climbed 15 basis points to 4.45
percent. It dropped below 4 percent on Oct. 4, the least since
January 2009.  The gap between yields on Australian  government bonds  and
inflation-indexed notes shows investors estimate consumer prices
will rise an average of 2.49 percent for the next five years,
down from 2011’s peak of 3.14 percent on May 6.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index, the nation’s benchmark
gauge of corporate bond risk, dropped 11 basis points to 196
basis points as of 11:35 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp.
prices show. A close of 196 would be the lowest since Oct. 12
while a decline of 11 basis points would be the most since Oct.
5, according to data provider CMA.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Australian dollar-
denominated corporate bonds instead of similar-maturity
government debt rose to 250 basis points yesterday, the highest
since August 2009, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data
show.  U.S. Malls  In the U.S., same-store sales fell 0.6 percent in the week
of Oct. 8, compared with a month earlier, according to data by
Johnson Redbook Research. The Conference Board Consumer
Confidence Index remained essentially unchanged in September
after a sharp decline in August. Vacancies at U.S. regional and
super-regional malls climbed to 9.4 percent in the three months
ended Sept. 30, the highest in at least a decade, Reis Inc.
figures showed. Shopping centers, usually anchored by
supermarkets, drugstores or discount retailers, had a net
decrease in occupied space of 17,000 square feet (1,600 square
meters) last quarter, compared with a net gain of 696,000 square
feet a year earlier, Reis said.  The share market too is reflecting the risk perceived by
debt investors.  Westfield Group (WDC)  shares have slumped 20 percent
this year, compared with a 7.3 percent drop in the S&P/ASX 200
A-REIT index. Westfield Retail Trust, which the group spun off
at the end of last year to buy half ownership of its Australian
and New Zealand shopping centers, has declined 0.4 percent in
2011.  Riskier Markets  The creation of the trust increased the parent company’s
exposure to riskier markets including the U.S. and  Europe , while
offering investors seeking relatively safer options a domestic
vehicle to put their capital into, the group said at the time.  Westfield also announced joint ventures to buy and develop
shopping centers in Milan and  Brazil  in August, its first forays
into new markets in 11 years, and said last month it is
assessing the Toronto Port Lands site for a possible investment.  “Global growth figures have been ratcheted down just about
everywhere you look,” said Stuart Cartledge, managing director
of boutique fund manager Phoenix Portfolios in Melbourne.
“Following the spinoff of  Westfield Retail Trust (WRT) , the impact of
a weakening environment offshore will have a bigger impact on
Westfield Group today than it would have 12 months ago.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
