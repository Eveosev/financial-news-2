Mauritius’s central bank is
targeting inflation of 5 percent to 6 percent, Business Magazine
reported, citing Bank of Mauritius Governor Rundheersing Bheenick.  The bank may “come back” to pursuing positive real
interest rates after pausing at its policy meeting last month,
the Port Louis-based magazine cited Bheenick as saying.
Inflation was 6.3 percent in September from a year earlier and
bank rate is 5.5 percent.  The Indian Ocean island nation’s economy will probably grow
at least 4 percent next year after expanding 4.4 percent in
2011, Bheenick said, according to the magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
