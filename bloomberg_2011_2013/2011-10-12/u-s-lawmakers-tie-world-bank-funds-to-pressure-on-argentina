U.S. lawmakers are trying to block
development loans to  Argentina  and seek out allies to pressure
President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  to settle with holders
of defaulted debt in exchange for funding development banks.  The measures are attached to a  bill  that authorizes a
combined $1.4 billion capital increase at development banks over
several years, including the  World Bank . The House Financial
Services Committee’s panel that oversees development banks today
approved the proposed legislation, which would then require a
vote by the full committee.  Under the proposed legislation, U.S. directors at the World
Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank should “oppose any
loan to the government of Argentina” and “initiate discussions
with other executive directors at the respective bank to
advocate and vigorously promote efforts to encourage Argentina
to normalize relations with its official and private creditors
and elsewhere in the international community.”  The U.S. has already started to vote against loans to
Argentina in the strongest move to date against Fernandez, who
polls show will win a second, four-year term in the Oct. 23
presidential election. The goal is to have Argentina make
payments owed investors and settle with holders of defaulted
debt, as well as respect obligations with institutions such as
the  International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporters on this story:
