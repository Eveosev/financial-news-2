About a year ago  I miscalculated   — badly — on the Microsoft Kinect. In terms of speed of adoption, only Apple's iPad has rivaled the Kinect. Aside from some tough comments on my blog, the long-term repercussions were low. That's pretty much what happens to a pundit who gets it wrong — nothing. Life is tougher for the strategist. A prescient call provides career rocket fuel, while the wrong one can be career limiting. So how to sift through the noise to evaluate the predictions that warrant the most careful attention? Watch out for the following four types of pundits. The non-user.  This pundit makes bold predictions about a product or service he's never used. Remember, a wide gulf separates a corporate press release or a carefully scripted demo and in-the-field reality. I ran into this trap when I  started getting excited  about Research in Motion's  Playbook  before the product had even been officially launched. The product's performance didn't live up to early press releases and has struggled in the market.  The projector.  This pundit makes predictions about markets that she doesn't participate in. For example, in 2008 a company called  Peek  launched a seemingly game-changing device that made it simple for people to access their email on the go. Many tech savvy reviewers said the product would take off because its simplicity would appeal to everyday users. The reviews convinced me to buy a Peek for my wife, but watching her use the device for five minutes led me to believe that as simple as the device seemed, it just didn't fit into my wife's life. That Christmas present quickly turned into a paperweight. The freeze framer.  Back in 2005 I wrote a piece [ PDF ] looking at a new video recorder introduced by Pure Digital Technologies, the Flip. I said the simple, easy-to-use product had one fatal flaw — customers had to drop it off at drugstores to get videos processed. How many would do that, I wondered? The mistake I made was assuming that Pure wasn't already working on its second version, which featured a simple mechanism to load video onto computers. The company took off and was ultimately acquired by Cisco for hundreds of millions of dollars. (Cisco strangely shut down Pure Digital this year, but that's  a different story .) Markets are dynamic, and if pundits don't take the long view they can make mistakes. This problem is one reason why I am skeptical of anything that is declared to be a "killer." The opiner.  Michael Mauboussin, the Chief Investment Strategist at Legg Mason Capital,  eloquently describes  how the key thing to evaluate when looking at equity investors isn't  what  they buy but  how they choose  what to buy. In other words, ask "What models do they use to make decisions? What process do they follow to gather data?" The same holds true for pundits. Offering opinions without explaining underlying assumptions or mental models isn't helpful. The real world is complicated and any prediction ought to at least spell out the assumptions that would have to be true for a prediction to hold. Wrong predictions based on well-reasoned (at the time) assumptions are useful because they help strategists develop their own instincts for assessing future technologies. As an occasionally unhelpful pundit myself, I hope I've helped you dodge these dangerous characters — or at least put their opinions into perspective.
