Farmers in  Portugal  may boost
plantings of genetically engineered corn by 59 percent this
year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s attache in Madrid
said, citing mandatory notifications submitted by growers.  The increase is due to an increase in overall corn
plantings, a rebound after damage from corn borer and a
temporary suspension of new applications for “agri-
environmental payments” that discriminate against genetically
engineered crops, the attache wrote in a report on the USDA
website. Portugal is the second-largest grower of genetically
engineered corn in the European Union after  Spain , according to
the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
