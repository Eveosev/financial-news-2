Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , the  United Arab
Emirates ’ biggest bank by assets, will pay for the acquisition
of state-owned Dubai Bank in cash, EFG-Hermes Holding SAE said.  The takeover will lower Emirates NBD’s total capital
adequacy ratio by 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point,
analysts Murad Ansari and Shabbir Malik said in a report, citing
guidance provided by management in a conference call yesterday.
With Tier 1 capital of 13.4 percent and a total capital adequacy
ratio of 21.2 percent at the end of June, “Emirates NBD has the
capacity to absorb Dubai Bank,” the investment bank said.  In the worst case scenario, the acquisition could reduce
Emirates NBD’s Tier 1 capital ratio by 263 basis points and the
total capital adequacy ratio by 307 basis points, “which though
lower are still healthy,” according to the report.  A spokesman for Emirates NBD, who declined to be identified
because of company policy, confirmed the bank made the
statements.  The Dubai government, which owns 56 percent of Emirates
NBD, said yesterday the lender will take over Dubai Bank PJSC as
part of a plan to enhance the emirate’s banking industry. Dubai
Bank, which was 70 percent owned by Dubai Holding LLC and 30
percent by  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , was nationalized in May after
loan losses increased.  Dubai Bank will be a stand-alone subsidiary of Emirates NBD
and not be merged with Emirates Islamic Bank PJSC, the bank’s
other Islamic unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
