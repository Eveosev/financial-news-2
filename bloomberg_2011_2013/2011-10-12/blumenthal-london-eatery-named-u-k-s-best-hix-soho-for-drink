Dinner by  Heston Blumenthal  in
 London  was last night named the U.K.’s best restaurant in the
Observer Food Monthly awards, just eight months after it opened.  Mark’s Bar, at Hix Soho in London, triumphed for best place
to drink, while Koya, also in Soho, was best for cheap eats. The
Sunday lunch award went to the Bull & Last in Kentish Town,
London. Michel Roux Sr. took the lifetime achievement crown.
Blumenthal, who also owns the Fat Duck in Bray, opened in the
U.K. capital in February this year.  The awards were announced in a party at the  London Film
Museum . The event has become a main event over the past eight
years for British restaurateurs, food producers and writers.
Some of the winners are picked by readers of the Observer Food
Monthly, others by a panel that includes chefs Jason Atherton,
Sat Bains,  Angela Hartnett  and Thomasina Miers.  It’s the season for giving in the U.K. restaurant business.
Zagat, AA Hospitality, Michelin and National Restaurant Awards
have named their favorites in the past month. The London
Restaurant Awards are on Oct. 17 and the Sunday Times Food List
follows later in October.  Last night’s winners included:  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
and leisure section of Bloomberg News. He is U.K. and Ireland
chairman of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants awards. Opinions
expressed are his own.)  To contact the writer on the story:
