U.S. crude refinery processing is
being “supported” by strong demand for oil-product exports,
the  International Energy Agency  said in its monthly report.  In July, the latest month for which detailed monthly data
is available, total U.S. exports averaged a record 2.9 million
barrels a day, 400,000 barrels a day more than in July last
year, the IEA said today.  Of this finished oil products accounted for 85 percent,
with gasoline blending components and other liquids the bulk of
the remainder. Diesel and other distillate fuels are exported to
Europe and  Latin America , while gasoline is mostly sent to
Mexico and other Latin American countries, the Paris-based
agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
