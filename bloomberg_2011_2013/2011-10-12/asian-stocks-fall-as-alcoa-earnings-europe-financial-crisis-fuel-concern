Asian stocks rose, with a regional
benchmark index posting its biggest five-day advance since March
2009, amid speculation that  China  will boost support for the
equity market after valuations dropped to record-low levels.  China Minsheng Banking Corp., the nation’s first non-state
lender, gained 2.7 percent in Hong Kong.  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) ,
China’s biggest Internet company by revenue, rose 1.9 percent.
Infosys Ltd., India’s second-largest software exporter, surged 7
percent in Mumbai after posting profit that beat analysts’
estimates.  Alumina Ltd. (AWC) , an Australian resource company, sank
2.5 percent in Sydney after U.S. partner  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  reported
profit that trailed analyst estimates.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.7 percent to 116.57 as
of 7:31 p.m. in  Tokyo  after reversing a loss of as much as 1.3
percent. Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong advanced, with banks
extending yesterday’s rally after Central Huijin Investment Ltd.,
a state-run investment arm, began buying shares of the top four
financial institutions.  “The government’s move fueled speculation that China’s
stocks are undervalued,” said Wu Kan, a fund manager at Dazhong
Insurance Co. which manages $285 million. “Central Huijin’s
move was a flash point, boosting investors’ confidence and
buying sentiment.”  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index climbed 1 percent, erasing a
loss of as much as 1.9 percent. The Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong rose 2.1 percent.
South Korea’s Kospi Index increased 0.8 percent.  Shanghai Composite  The Shanghai Composite Index surged 3 percent, the steepest
increase in a year. The measure has tumbled 14 percent this year,
driving down estimated price earnings to 11 times, compared with
the record low of 10.8 times set on Oct. 10, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Stocks have fallen as the Chinese
government raised  interest rates  and reserve requirement ratios
for banks to cool inflation that’s at the highest level in
almost three years.  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined for the first
time in four days, losing 0.4 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index dropped 0.6 percent, snapping five straight daily advances.
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell 2.1 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1 percent
today, erasing losses of as much as 0.7 percent. In  New York ,
the index rose 0.1 percent yesterday, while the Dow Jones
Industrial Average retreated 0.2 percent.  China Minsheng gained 2.7 percent to HK$5.31 in Hong Kong.
Bank of China Ltd. added 1.5 percent to HK$2.69 and  China
Construction Bank Corp. (939)  increased 2.5 percent to HK$5.24.
Tencent rose 1.9 percent to HK$173.30 and  Belle International
Holdings Ltd. (1880) , a Chinese retailer of women’s shoes, climbed 1
percent to HK$14.36.  ‘Nearing the Floor’  “China’s purchases of banking shares is sending a message
to investors that we’re nearing the floor,” said  Pauline Dan ,
Hong Kong-based chief investment officer at Samsung Asset
Management, which oversees about $72 billion. “Valuations,
particularly for Chinese banks, are certainly cheap.”  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped 0.3 percent
yesterday, ending a four-day rally amid uncertainty that
 Slovakia  will ratify the euro area’s revised bailout fund.
Slovakia is the only member of the euro area that hasn’t
ratified the action.  European leaders must go beyond a planned recapitalization
of banks to resolve the continent’s sovereign-debt crisis, U.S.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said in a Bloomberg
Television interview yesterday. Geithner will be in Paris on Oct.
13-14 for a meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers.  “Asian stocks remain vulnerable to short-term setbacks,
particularly in places like  Europe , which could trigger profit
taking,” said Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-based strategist for AMP
Capital Investors Ltd. “You’ve had some very strong equity
gains recently, which means a pause right now wouldn’t be too
surprising.”  Estimated Earnings  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 16 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 4.9 percent loss by the  S&P
500  and a 15 percent decline by the Stoxx 600. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 11.9 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 12 times for the S&P 500 and 10.1 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Infosys climbed 7 percent to 2,679.35 rupees in Mumbai. The
company reported second-quarter net income rose 9.8 percent from
a year earlier to 19.1 billion rupees ($387 million), exceeding
the median estimate of 18.7 billion rupees by 35 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  ‘Lock In Profits’  Alumina sank 2.5 percent to A$1.555 in Sydney. Alcoa, the
first company in the Dow to report results, said profit
excluding some costs was 14 cents a share last quarter, trailing
the 22 cents forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Less-than-expected earnings from Alcoa will likely move
investors to sell exporter shares to lock in profits, as the
market had been rising on optimism about U.S. corporate
earnings,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in Tokyo at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.  Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-largest automaker by
revenue that gets 40 percent of its revenue from the U.S., fell
2.2 percent to 2,295 yen in Tokyo, pacing declines among
Japanese companies that suspended production in  Thailand  because
of floods.  Nikon Corp. (7731) , a maker of cameras, lenses and scanners,
dropped 3.5 percent to 1,780 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
