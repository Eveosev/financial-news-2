The outcome of the euro crisis may
determine whether  Hungary  will need to resort to another
 International Monetary Fund  loan, said Zsigmond Jarai, a former
central bank president and head of the state Fiscal Council.  “Nothing is unimaginable on this front and it depends on
what happens in the world economy,” Jarai told TV2 late
yesterday, according to a  video  posted on the commercial
station’s website. “It’s unforeseeable what will happen in the
world economy, and only that could push Hungary into a situation
where the financing of the state debt becomes uncertain.”  Hungary may be “part of a group of countries” whose
economies would be most affected by a potential Greek default,
said Jarai, who is an ally and former finance minister of Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban .  That would be comparable to the 2008 Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. bankruptcy, Jarai said, referring to the cataclysm
that plunged global financial markets into turmoil and forced
Hungary to become the first European Union member to obtain an
IMF bailout three years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
