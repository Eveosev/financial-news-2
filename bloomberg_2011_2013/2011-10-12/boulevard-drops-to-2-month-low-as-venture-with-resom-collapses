Boulevard Holdings Inc. (BHI) , a
Philippine real-estate developer, fell to a two-month low in
Manila after the company said it failed to close talks with
South Koreaâ€™s Resom Resorts to lease an existing golf course and
spa hotel site south of Manila.  Boulevard slumped as much as 15 percent to 17 centavos and
traded at 17.8 centavos at 9:53 a.m. local time, heading for the
lowest close since Aug. 9. The benchmark Philippine Stock
Exchange Index decreased 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
