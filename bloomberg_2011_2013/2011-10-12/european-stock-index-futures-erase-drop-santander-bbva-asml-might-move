European stocks climbed to a two-
month high as the European Commission’s Olli Rehn said the debt
crisis can be resolved, outweighing earnings from  Alcoa Inc. (AA) 
that missed estimates.  Greek banks rallied, with Alpha Bank SA and  National Bank
of Greece SA (ETE)  soaring at least 15 percent.  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY) ,
the U.K.’s largest luxury-goods maker, climbed 3.5 percent as
sales topped forecasts.  ASML Holding NV (ASML)  added 6.3 percent after
Europe’s biggest semiconductor-equipment maker reported income
that beat projections.  YIT Oyj (YTY1V) ,  Finland ’s largest builder, slid
4.1 percent after cutting its profit outlook.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 1.7 percent to 239.16 at
the close of trading, the highest since Aug. 4. The measure has
rallied 10 percent since Oct. 4 for the biggest six-day gain
since January 2009. The gauge has still tumbled 18 percent from
its high on Feb. 17 amid concern that the sovereign debt crisis
in Europe will spread from  Greece  to the larger economies of
 Italy  and  Spain .  “Equity markets are still giving euro-zone leaders the
benefit of the doubt in their efforts to stem the crisis,”
Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in
 London , wrote in an e-mail. “A greater sense of urgency should
not be mistaken for measures to tackle the sovereign debt crisis
head-on.”  National benchmark indexes climbed in all of the 18
western-European markets, except Iceland.  Germany ’s DAX advanced
2.2 percent and  France ’s CAC 40 increased 2.4 percent. The
U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.9 percent to a two-month high.  Coordinated Action  Rehn, the EU’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner,
said in a prerecorded speech to a Dublin conference that the
euro area is approaching a consensus on resolving the debt
crisis. He said economic growth is stalling and  Europe  is in “a
very dangerous place,” though the region can avert “calamity”
by coordinating action, increasing banks’ capital and enhancing
growth.  The Stoxx 600 earlier fell as much as 1 percent as
political wrangling in Slovakia delayed the ratification of the
euro area’s overhauled bailout fund. Slovak parties reached an
agreement to approve the European Financial Stability Facility
today after failing to pass the package yesterday. Foreign
Minister Mikulas Dzurinda said lawmakers may vote again on the
measures tomorrow.  Alcoa Earnings  Alcoa, the first company in the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  to report earnings this quarter, posted profit that
trailed estimates, saying European customers “dramatically”
cut orders because of economic uncertainty. The U.S. aluminum
producer reported income in the third quarter excluding
restructuring costs and tax benefits of 14 cents a share,
missing the average estimate of 22 cents in a Bloomberg survey.  European industrial production unexpectedly rose for a
second month in August as increasing output in countries from
France to Portugal and Italy offset a slump in Germany.  Production in the 17-nation euro area advanced 1.2 percent
from July, when it rose 1.1 percent, the EU’s statistics office
said today. That’s the biggest gain since November 2010.
Economists had forecast a drop of 0.8 percent, the median of 32
estimates in a Bloomberg survey showed.  Alpha Bank and National Bank of Greece soared 18 percent to
98 euro cents and 15 percent to 1.84 euros, respectively.
 Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)  rallied 14 percent to 29 euro cents.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  jumped 6.4 percent to 187 pence.  Societe
Generale (GLE)  SA and  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, France’s biggest banks, added 6
percent to 23.16 euros and 5.7 percent to 35.35 euros.  ‘Piecemeal Responses’  European Commission President  Jose Barroso  called for a
reinforcement of crisis-hit banks, the payout of a sixth loan to
Greece and a faster start for a permanent rescue fund to master
Europe’s debt woes.  “Reactive and piecemeal responses to different aspects of
the crisis are no longer sufficient,” Barroso said in Brussels.
“We now need to get ahead of the curve.”  Burberry gained 3.5 percent to 1,308 pence after reporting
fiscal second-quarter sales that beat analysts’ estimates and
dispelled concern that demand has slowed with plans to add 15
percent to its average retail space.  Revenue in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to 463
million pounds ($729 million) from 382 million pounds a year
earlier, the London-based company said. The average of 11
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 447.8 million pounds.  ASML increased 6.3 percent to 28.20 euros after reporting
third-quarter net income of 355 million euros ($489 million),
topping the average estimate of 323 million euros in a Bloomberg
survey of 16 analysts.  Carmakers, Chemicals Gain  Michelin & Cie., the world’s second-largest tiremaker,
gained 5.6 percent to 49.18 euros as a gauge of auto stocks
posted the best performance of the 19 industry groups in the
Stoxx 600.  Fiat SpA (F) , Italy’s biggest automaker, jumped 7.8
percent to 4.92 euros and Germany’s  Daimler AG (DAI)  surged 5.6
percent to 37.85 euros.  Clariant AG (CLN)  and  Yara International ASA (YAR)  led a rally in
chemical stocks, climbing 6.4 percent to 9.76 Swiss francs and
4.8 percent to 247 kroner, respectively. K+S AG, Europe’s
biggest potash producer, added 3.9 percent to 43.80 euros.  A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S rose 4.2 percent to 35,320 kroner
as the world’s biggest container-shipping line said it agreed to
sell its Maersk LNG A/S unit to Teekay LNG Operating LLC and
Marubeni Corp. for $1.4 billion.  YIT plunged 4.1 percent to 12.49 euros. The company cut its
full-year outlook for operating profit after making a 10
million-euro provision in the third quarter for an ammonia
problem at its flats in  St. Petersburg .  Man Group Plc (EMG) , the world’s largest hedge fund manager, sank
6 percent to 155.30 pence after reporting that the net-asset
value of its AHL Diversified fund fell 5.5 percent in the week
through Oct. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
