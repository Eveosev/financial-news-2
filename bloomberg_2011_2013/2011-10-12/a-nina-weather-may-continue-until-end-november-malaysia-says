La Nina weather conditions may
continue in  Malaysia  until the end of November, the
Meteorological Department said. There should be “normal”
rainfall in most states, though it’s likely to be above average
in Sabah, the government said in a report today.  “The amount of rainfall basically should be enough for
agricultural activities such as  palm oil ,” it said. “This
abundant rainfall may cause prolonged soil saturation that will
affect crop growth or yields for rice, palm oil, cocoa,
especially over low-lying areas.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
