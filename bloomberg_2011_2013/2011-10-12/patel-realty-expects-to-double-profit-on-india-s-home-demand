Patel Realty Ltd. , the real estate
unit of Indian construction company  Patel Engineering Ltd. (PEC) ,
expects profit to double this year on rising demand for homes in
the world’s second-fastest growing major economy.  The developer may post a profit of as much as 400 million
rupees ($8.2 million) in the year ending in March, compared with
about 200 million rupees in the previous 12 months, Managing
Director Rupen Patel said in an interview in Mumbai today.
Earnings may gain about 80 percent next year, he said.  Sales may double to as much as 3 billion rupees by the end
of next year as the company expects to increase sales from
office and residence projects in Mumbai and Bangalore, Patel
said.  India ’s young population, low penetration of mortgages and
rapid urbanization are helping boost home demand, UBS AG said in
a report in May.  Mumbai-based Patel Realty has a land bank of 1,100 acres
(4.4 million square meters), mostly in cities such as Hyderabad,
Chennai, Bangalore and Mumbai. It has 7 million square feet
(650,321 square meters) under development.  Patel Engineering rose 3.6 percent to 99.3 rupees at close
in Mumbai today. The stock has dropped 67 percent this year,
compared with BSE-500 index’s 18 percent decline.  The company is also setting up townships in Bangalore, the
New Delhi suburb of Noida and  Port Louis , the capital of
 Mauritius , under the brand ‘Neotown.’ Patel Realty will start
its first residential project in the southern city of Hyderabad
by year-end and aims to complete its first mall in Bangalore in
two years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
