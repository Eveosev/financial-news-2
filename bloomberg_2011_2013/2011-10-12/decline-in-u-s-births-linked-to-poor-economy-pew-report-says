A decline in U.S. births since 2007
is linked to the recession that started in December of that
year, with hard-hit  Florida ,  California  and  Nevada  experiencing
sharp fertility declines, a report by Pew Research Center said.  Nevada, where housing prices have dropped by more than half
since 2006, saw its birth rate drop to 71.2 births per thousand
women aged 15 to 44 in 2009 from 74.8 in 2008, the report said.
 North Dakota , with an unemployment rate of just 3.1 percent in
2008, was the only state to show an increase in births from 2008
to 2009, Pew said. Nationwide, the birth rate dropped to 66.7 in
2009 from 68.5 the year before.  Many younger women may be postponing childbirth for
economic reasons and may decide to have children when the
economy improves, the report said. Pew’s report sought to
explain a decline in births to about 4 million nationally in
2010 from 4.3 million in 2007, according to National Center for
Health Statistics data.  “States experiencing the largest economic declines in 2007
and 2008 were most likely to experience relatively large
fertility declines from 2008 to 2009,” the  report  said.
“States with relatively minor economic declines were likely to
experience relatively small declines.”  Hispanics, whose employment levels and household wealth
were more severely hurt in the recession, experienced the
largest fertility declines of the nation’s three major racial
and ethnic groups, Pew said.  “People put off having children during the economic
downturn, and then catch up on fertility once economic
conditions improve,” Pew said. Still, “It’s too early to know
if fertility will bounce back as the  U.S. economy  recovers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
