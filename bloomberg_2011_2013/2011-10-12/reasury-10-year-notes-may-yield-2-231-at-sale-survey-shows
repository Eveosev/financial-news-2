The Treasury Department’s $21
billion sale of 10-year notes may draw a yield of 2.231 percent,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
eight of the  Federal Reserve ’s 22 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in August 2021, yielded 2.225
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time.  Last month’s $21 billion offering of the notes drew a
record low yield of 2 percent. The Sept. 13 sale’s bid-to-cover
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the
amount offered, was 3.03, versus 3.22 at the August auction and
an average of 3.16 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 48.5 percent of the securities
at last month’s auction, compared with the average for the past
10 sales of 48.8 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 11.1 percent of
the notes at the September sale, compared with a record 31.7
percent in August and a 10-sale average of 10.6 percent.  Ten-year notes have returned 13.5 percent this year,
compared with a 7.7 percent gain for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The U.S. sold $32 billion of three-year debt yesterday at a
yield of 0.544 percent. It will auction $13 billion in 30-year
securities tomorrow in the last of this week’s $66 billion in
note and bond offerings.  The entire amount raised this week is new cash, with none
of the proceeds dedicated to redeeming maturing securities,
according to the Treasury Department.  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the
central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
