Damage to rice crops from  Thailand 
to Philippines may ‘push up’ prices this year as global
production of milled rice may be less than previously forecast,
according to the International Rice Research Institute.  Flooding in Thailand, the world’s biggest rice exporter,
has damaged as much as 5 million metric tons of paddy, while a
typhoon in Philippines and flooding in Cambodia and Laos will
trim grain output, Samarendu Mohanty, a senior economist at the
institute, said in an interview in New Delhi today.  Global production of milled rice may be as low as 455
million tons in the year that began on Sept.1, less than the 460
million tons forecast last month, he said.  Damage to crops in Thailand,  Cambodia  and Philippines could
boost import demand for rice,  Robert Zeigler , director-general
of the institute, said in a separate interview.  “There will be supply-demand imbalances by the end of this
year and early 2012,’” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
