Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc
Frieden said heâ€™s confident that  Greece  will receive a sixth
tranche of financial aid and Slovakia will approve the European
Financial Stability Facility rescue fund.  The European Union must act quickly to implement the EFSF
fund and boost its flexibility and some European lenders should
be recapitalized to help stop sovereign debt contagion spreading
from Greece, Frieden said at a conference in  Frankfurt  today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
