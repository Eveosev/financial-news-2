Arseus NV (RCUS)  has been approached by one
or more investment funds with regard to a takeover, De Tijd
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The whole process is in a very early phase, with no talk of
a price or concrete bid, the newspaper said.  “I can give no comment on something that I myself know
nothing about,” Chief Executive Officer Ger Van Jeveren said,
according to the newspaper.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
