Oil advanced to trade near its
highest in three weeks in  New York  on speculation that European
Union proposals on bank recapitalization will support economic
growth and fuel consumption.  Futures rose for a sixth day, their longest winning streak
this year. European Commission President  Jose Barroso  is due to
outline plans in Brussels today. The  International Energy
Agency , which cut its global oil demand forecast for 2012, said
recent data doesn’t signal a “downward consumption spiral.”  “There’s relief about the risk in the EU,” said Thorbjorn Bak Jensen, an analyst at Global Risk Management in Middelfart,
 Denmark , who forecasts Brent will average $107 a barrel this
quarter. “On a longer horizon, inflation expectations and
recovered growth after the sovereign debt problems have been
solved will support  oil prices .”  Crude for November delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose as much as 78 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $86.59 a
barrel and was at $86.27 at 12:40 p.m. London time. The contract
yesterday climbed as high as $86.64, the highest price since
Sept. 21. Prices are down 5.4 percent this year.  Brent oil for November settlement rose $1.13 to $111.86 on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European
benchmark contract was at a premium of as much as $25.60 to U.S.
crude, the most since Sept. 15 and down from a record of $26.87
on Sept. 6.  IEA Cuts Forecast  The Paris-based IEA reduced estimates for world demand in
2012 by 210,000 barrels a day, to 90.5 million a day. That means
consumption will increase by 1.3 million barrels a day, or 1.4
percent, from this year. Oil inventories in industrialized
nations fell below their five-year average for the first time in
more than three years, according to the IEA.  “There’s still robust growth but it’s being affected by
this economic slowdown,”  David Fyfe , head of the IEA’s industry
and markets division, said in an interview with Maryam Nemazee
on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse.” The IEA doesn’t “think
the balance of probabilities has tipped towards that much weaker
picture of economic growth for next year.”  U.S. crude-oil stockpiles probably rose by 800,000 barrels
last week, according to the median of 15 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey before a weekly Energy Department report
tomorrow. The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute 
publishes its weekly figures today. Both sets of data are being
released a day later than usual because of this week’s Columbus
Day holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
