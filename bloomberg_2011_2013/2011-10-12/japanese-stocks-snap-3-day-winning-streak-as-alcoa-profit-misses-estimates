Japanese stocks fell for the first
time in four days after U.S. bellwether  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  missed
analysts’ earnings estimates, signaling the world’s biggest
economy is slowing.  Nintendo Co., a maker of game consoles that gets almost 40
percent of its sales from the Americas, slid 2.5 percent.
Chemicals maker Showa Denko K.K. and  Nikon Corp. (7731) , a camera
manufacturer, fell after flooding disrupted production in
Thailand. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., Japan’s second-largest
shipping line by revenue, jumped 6.4 percent after cargo rates
hit a 10-month high.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 0.4 percent to 8,738.90
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The gauge snapped a three-day
winning streak that came as German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President Nicholas Sarkozy pledged to contain  Europe ’s
debt crisis. The Topix lost 0.2 percent to 753.44 today amid
uncertainty about Slovakia ratifying a euro-area bailout fund.  “Investors expected that stocks would have plunged after
Alcoa’s earnings and the news on Slovakia, but the market has
been resilient,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and
strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “Some
investors are buying back stocks.”  Debt Crisis  The Topix has tumbled 16 percent this year amid concern
U.S. growth is sputtering and Europe’s debt crisis will spread
to the banking system. The decline has cut the price of shares
on the index to 0.89 times estimated book value, near the lowest
since March 2009.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed after falling as much as 0.7 percent earlier today in
 New York . The index rose 0.1 percent yesterday, while the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  retreated 0.2 percent.  Alcoa, the first company of the Dow to report results for
the third quarter, tumbled 4.8 percent at 5:08 p.m. after the
largest U.S. smelter of aluminum reported profit that trailed
analysts’ estimates as production costs increased and the pace
of global demand growth slowed.  “Alcoa earnings lost momentum last quarter and that
suggests the  U.S. economy  is also slowing down,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , who helps oversee $6 billion at Shinkin Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo. “That’s made investors wary.”  Thai Floods  Exporters to the U.S. declined. Nintendo dropped 2.5 percent to
11,600 yen.  Olympus Corp. (7733) , an optical-equipment maker that gets
more than 20 percent of its revenue from  North America , slid 2.1
percent to 2,373 yen.  Showa Denko led declines among Japanese companies that
suspended production in Thailand because of flooding. The
chemical company sank 5.1 percent to 150 yen. Nikon fell 3.5
percent to 1,780 yen, while Honda Motor Co. slumped 2.2 percent
to 2,295 yen.  JS Group Corp., a housing materials maker, declined the
most on the Topix, plunging 12 percent to 1,800 yen after saying
it missed its forecast for net income by 22 percent in the six
months ended Sept. 30, coming in at 18 billion yen ($235
million). The company said earnings were hurt by bigger-than-
expected impact from  Japan ’s earthquake.  Japanese stock losses were limited after the nation’s
August machinery orders grew at the fastest pace in a year and
the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index rallied, rising 2.4
percent as of the close in Tokyo amid speculation that  China 
will boost support for the equity market after valuations
dropped to record-low levels.  Chinese Sentiment  “Sentiment is picking up in Chinese markets,” said  Ryuta
Otsuka , a strategist at Toyo Securities Co. in Tokyo.
“Investors bought companies and industries that largely depend
on China’s market after stocks there rose.”  Shipping lines advanced the most among the 33 Topix
industry groups after the Baltic Dry Index of cargo rates rose
yesterday to the highest since Dec. 9. Mitsui O.S.K. soared 6.4
percent to 301 yen and Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s biggest
shipping line by sales, gained 5.2 percent to 202 yen.  Kawasaki
Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107) , the No. 3, jumped 6 percent to 159 yen.  Makers of factory equipment gained after Japan’s machinery
orders rose in August at the fastest pace in a year, signaling
that companies are willing to invest even as global economic
growth slows and the yen stays near post-World War II highs.
Makino Milling Machine Co. gained 4.5 percent to 514 yen, while
Okuma Corp. climbed 2.9 percent to 528 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
