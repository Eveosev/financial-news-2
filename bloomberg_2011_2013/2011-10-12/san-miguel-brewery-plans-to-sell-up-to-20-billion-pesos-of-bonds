San Miguel Brewery Inc. (SMB) , the largest
Philippine beermaker, plans to sell as much as 20 billion pesos
($458 million) of bonds to refinance debt from 2009 due next
year, a regulatory filing showed.  The new bonds will come due no sooner than five years from
their issue date, San Miguel Brewery said in an Oct. 11 filing
the Philippine Stock Exchange released today. The company
announced the planned bond sale after the energy venture of
parent  San Miguel Corp. (SMC)  postponed plans for an $854 million
initial share sale this year due to “market volatility.”  Net income rose 40 percent from a year earlier to 3 billion
pesos in the three months ended June 30, the brewer, a venture
with  Japan ’s Kirin Holdings Co., reported last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
