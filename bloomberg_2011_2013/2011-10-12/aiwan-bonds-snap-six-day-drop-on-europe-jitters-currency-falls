Taiwan ’s government bonds snapped a
six-day slide and the local dollar weakened on concern  Europe ’s
debt crisis and a slowdown in the  U.S. economy  will sap demand
for the island’s exports.  The Taiex index of shares retreated today amid uncertainty
that Slovakia will ratify the euro area’s revised bailout fund.
Indonesia unexpectedly cut its benchmark  interest rate  by 25
basis points to 6.5 percent yesterday and the nation’s
government said last month it was preparing measures to support
the economy. Philippine President Benigno Aquino unveiled today
a 72.1 billion-peso ($1.7 billion) stimulus package to protect
economic growth.  “Investors are concerned about Asia’s growth prospects,”
said Albert Lee, a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Cathay
United Bank Co. “The fall in both Taiwan stocks and U.S. stock
futures increased demand for bonds.”  The yield on the government’s 2 percent bonds due July
2016, the most-traded securities, dropped one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 1.04 percent, prices from Gretai
Securities Market show. The rate touched 1.05 percent yesterday,
the highest level for benchmark five-year debt since Aug. 17.  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.2 percent to NT$30.400 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
this year’s low of NT$30.722 on Oct. 4.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.392 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
