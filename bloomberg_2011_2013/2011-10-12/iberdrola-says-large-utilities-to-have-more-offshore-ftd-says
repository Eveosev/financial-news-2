Iberdrola SA (IBE) ’s head of offshore
business, Alvaro Martinez Palacio, said “offshore facilities
will become a business for large utilities,” Financial Times
Deutschland reported, citing an interview.  Small and medium-sized business will barely be involved in
the offshore business in the future, he told the German
newspaper. Iberdrola is building a park with 80 turbines in the
German Ostsee, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
