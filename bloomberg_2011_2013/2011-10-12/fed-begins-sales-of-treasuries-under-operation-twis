The  Federal Reserve  began selling as
much of $9 billion of Treasuries as part of its program to
replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries in an effort to reduce borrowing costs.  The central bank is offering securities maturing from March
2013 to October 2013 for sale between 10:15 a.m. and 11 a.m. New
York time, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York
statement  today .  The Fed will purchase $44 billion of longer-maturity
Treasuries and sell the same amount of shorter-term debt in
October under a monetary stimulus plan thatâ€™s become known as
Operation Twist.  To contact the reporter on this story:
