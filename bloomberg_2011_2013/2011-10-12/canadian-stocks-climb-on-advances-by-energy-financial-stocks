Canadian stocks rose for a second
day, led by energy and financial shares, after European
Commission President Jose Barroso’s call for a coordinated
response to the continent’s debt crisis spurred optimism about
the global economy.  Suncor Energy Inc., the nation’s largest oil and gas
producer, gained 2.6 percent after the commission released a so-
called  road map  to address Greek debt, European lenders and the
economy.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  North America ’s fourth-
largest insurer, increased 4 percent.  First Quantum Minerals
Ltd. (FM) ,  Canada ’s second-largest publicly traded copper producer,
jumped 6.2 percent as the  U.S. dollar  dropped against six major
counterparts.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index rose 154.41
points, or 1.3 percent, to a three-week high of 12,029.96. The
S&P/TSX rebounded 7.6 percent in five days after closing at a
14-month low on Oct. 4 as optimism European officials will aid
the continent’s banks led to gains in the euro and a weaker U.S.
dollar.  “The global mindset had been very negative, very focused
on worst-case scenarios,” David Baskin, president of Baskin
Financial Services Inc., said in a telephone interview from
Toronto. The firm oversees C$400 million ($393 million). “That
doesn’t seem to be happening, so there’s a sigh of relief.”  Crude oil futures surged 13 percent and copper rallied 6
percent from Oct. 4 to yesterday, boosting energy and raw-
materials stocks. Companies in those industries make up 47
percent of Canadian stocks by market value, according to
Bloomberg data.  Currency Gains  The euro advanced 1.1 percent against the U.S. dollar
today, extending its climb since Oct. 3 to 4.7 percent.  Fifty-nine of 66 S&P/TSX energy companies rose. Suncor
increased 2.6 percent to C$29.61.  Crescent Point Energy Corp. (CPG) 
rallied 4.9 percent to C$41.91 as oil and gas producers with
operations in western Canada climbed a day after China
Petrochemical Corp. agreed to buy Daylight Energy Ltd. for C$2.2
billion.  Athabasca Oil Sands Corp. (ATH) , an oil-sands developer that
began trading in April 2010, soared 8.15 percent to C$12.60
after advancing a record 8.17 percent yesterday.  Trican Well Service Ltd., the country’s biggest oilfield-
services company, gained 8.8 percent, the most since September
2009, to C$18.56. The shares rallied for a second day after New
Orleans-based Superior Energy Services Inc. agreed to buy
Houston-based Complete Production Services Inc. for about $2.6
billion in cash and stock.  All S&P/TSX banks and insurers advanced. Manulife climbed 4
percent to C$12.85.  Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) , Canada’s third-
biggest insurance company, climbed 3.7 percent to C$26.45.  Royal
Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s largest lender by assets, gained
1.8 percent to C$48.83.  Copper Producers  Copper futures increased 3.1 percent on the Comex in  New
York  as Asian inventories shrank. First Quantum Minerals surged
6.2 percent to C$17.21.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , the country’s
biggest base-metals and coal producer, rose 2.1 percent to
C$36.03. Quadra FNX Mining Ltd., which operates in the U.S.,
Canada and  Chile , climbed 5 percent to C$11.01.  Extorre Gold Mines Ltd. (XG) , which explores in  Argentina ,
gained for a second day after reporting high-grade drilling
results, advancing 13 percent to C$8.89. The shares jumped 9
percent yesterday.  BlackBerry maker  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  retreated 3.5
percent to C$24.27 after service outages spread to North America
and  South America . Disruptions continued in  Europe , the  Middle
East  and  Africa  for a third day.  The S&P/TSX has increased at least 150 points four of the
past five days. That has happened only once before, when the
index climbed at least 150 points five times in a six-day period
in December 2008 and January 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
