The Serbian dinar gained 0.7 percent
as markets anticipated the country will receive positive news
about its bid to become a candidate for European Union
membership.  The dinar traded at 100.50 against the euro as of 11:39
a.m. in the capital Belgrade, according to Bloomberg data, up
from the central bank’s official mid-rate of 101.2273 yesterday.  The market is “essentially expecting good news from
Brussels” on top of “some corporate demand for dinars,” said
Ljiljana Grubic, an analyst with Belgrade-based Raiffeisen Bank
AD.  The EU will release its 2011 enlargement report later today
with new opinions on the progress made by Western Balkan
countries toward membership in the world’s largest trading bloc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
