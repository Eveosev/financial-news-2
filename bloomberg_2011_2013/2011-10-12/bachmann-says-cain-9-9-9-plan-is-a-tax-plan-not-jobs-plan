Congresswoman Michele Bachmann
attacked Republican presidential rival  Herman Cain ’s tax
proposal as “a tax plan, not a jobs plan.”  The so-called 9-9-9 plan would create “a new pipeline for
Congress” to collect taxes from Americans, she said at a
Republican debate tonight in  New Hampshire . “When you take the
9-9-9 plan and turn it upside down, I think the devil is in the
details.”  Cain, a former pizza executive, has proposed replacing the
current tax system with 9 percent corporate and individual taxes
and a 9 percent sales tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
