Boston  Red Sox  General Manager Theo
Epstein agreed to a five-year, $15 million contract with the
 Chicago Cubs , Boston sports radio station WEEI reported.  The move won’t be complete until the two teams agree on how
the Cubs would compensate the Red Sox for the loss of the
general manager, the radio station reported, citing people it
didn’t identify.  Epstein has been general manager for nine seasons, winning
two World Series. The Cubs last won baseball’s championship in
1908.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
