Former Utah Governor  Jon Huntsman 
called for a flat-tax plan that is “doable,” saying former
Godfather’s Pizza chief executive  Herman Cain ’s so-called nine-
nine-nine plan is a “catchy phrase” that he thought “was the
price of a pizza when I first heard it.”  Huntsman said he supports ending loopholes and deductions
in exchange for a “revenue neutral” decrease in income tax
rates.  Cain responded that his plan -- which calls for a 9 percent
individual income tax rate, a 9 percent corporate tax rate, and
a 9 percent national sales tax -- would pass Congress and has
been “well-studied” by economists.  Huntsman and Cain spoke at a debate sponsored by Bloomberg
LP and The Washington Post in Hanover,  New Hampshire .  To contact the reporter on this story:
