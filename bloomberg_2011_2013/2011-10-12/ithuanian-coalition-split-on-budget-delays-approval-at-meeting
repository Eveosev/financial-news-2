Two of  Lithuania ’s three coalition
parties opposed the 2012 budget plan in government talks today,
delaying its approval as an Oct. 17 deadline looms.  The Liberal and Center Union and the Liberal Movement
oppose the  Finance Ministry ’s plan to cut financing for
ministries by 300 million litai ($119 million), the parties said
in a press conference in Vilnius.  “It’s not normal” to further deepen the austerity burden
on public employees such as teachers and doctors at a time when
the government plans to raise pensions to levels last seen
before the global financial crisis, said Transport Minister
Eligijus Masiulis, head of the Liberal Movement. Masiulis called
for “more solidarity” in sharing the burden and a delay in the
pension increases until the second quarter of 2012.  The Baltic nation’s government aims to cut the budget
shortfall to 2.8 percent of gross domestic product next year by
cutting financing for ministries and raising more revenue from
state-owned companies. The government must submit the draft to
parliament by Oct. 17.  The coalition agreed on the 2.8 percent budget target, even
though discussions continue on how to achieve it, Prime Minister
Andrius Kubilius said.  The government is “prepared to respond” with additional
budget measures for 2012 should the European sovereign-credit
crisis deteriorate in November and December, Kubilius said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
