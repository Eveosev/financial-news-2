U.K. doctors are undertreating a
major risk factor for strokes, according to  research  published
in the journal  BMJ Open .  Only one in four stroke patients who were diagnosed for
atrial fibrillation, or irregular heartbeat, were prescribed
preventative blood-thinning treatment, researchers at Boehringer
Ingelheim GmbH and  Imperial College London ’s National Heart and
Lung Institute wrote after analyzing data from 32,151 patients
who had a stroke between 1999 and 2008.  Atrial fibrillation occurs when the upper chambers of the
heart quiver rather than contract, allowing blood to pool and
form clots that can lead to strokes. About 110,000 strokes occur
in  England  each year, with 46,500 deaths resulting from them in
England and  Wales  in 2008, or 9 percent of all deaths, the
researchers said.  “Survival after stroke has improved in the past 10
years,” the researchers wrote. “There is, however, scope for
further improvement.”  While women were significantly more likely to have serious
atrial fibrillation than men, they were less likely to be given
blood-thinning therapy, according to the study. The treatment
was given to 29 percent of men with the condition and 22 percent
of women, the study found.  Boehringer Ingelheim, based in Ingelheim,  Germany , funded
the research. The company sells the Pradaxa blood-thinning
medicine.  -- Editors: Kristen Hallam, Phil Serafino  To contact the reporters on this story:
