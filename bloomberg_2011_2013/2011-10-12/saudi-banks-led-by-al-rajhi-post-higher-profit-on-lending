Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , Saudi Arabia’s
largest lender by market value, led others in posting higher
third-quarter profit as lending income rose amid higher
government spending in the biggest Arab economy.  Al Rajhi’s net income in the period climbed 18 percent to
1.94 billion riyals ($516 million), it said in a statement to
the Saudi bourse today. The mean estimate of six analysts was
for a profit of 1.9 billion riyals, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Higher lending has helped improve earnings at Saudi banks
as growth in the world’s largest oil producer accelerates,
spurred by a $130 billion spending plan announced by  King
Abdullah .  Saudi British Bank (SABB) , the kingdom’s fourth-largest
lender by market value,  Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR)  and  Saudi Hollandi
Bank (AAAL)  reported higher quarterly profit.  Saudi British reported a 50 percent jump in profit to 630
million riyals and Banque Saudi, a Saudi lender part-owned by
Credit Agricole SA, said profit climbed to 760 million riyals in
the period.  Saudi Hollandi posted a third-quarter profit of 299.4
million riyals, compared with 85.3 million riyals a year
earlier, and beating the 239.6 million-riyal mean estimates of
five analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Al Rajhi’s profit rose as the lender gained “higher income
from banking fees and investment income,” the company said.
Operating profit rose 7.6 percent to 3.65 billion riyals in the
third quarter, while total lending climbed 12.3 percent to 134.6
billion riyals at the end of September.  Al Rajhi  shares advanced 0.4 percent to 68.50 riyals while
Saudi British dropped 0.5 percent to 40 riyals. Banque Saudi
declined 1 percent to 38.60 riyals and Saudi Hollandi fell 0.8
percent to 25.90 riyals. The Tadawul All Share Bank Index has
tumbled 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
