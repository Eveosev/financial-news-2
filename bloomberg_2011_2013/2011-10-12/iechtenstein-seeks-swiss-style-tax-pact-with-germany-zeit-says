Liechtenstein Prime Minister Klaus Tschuetscher said the principality will seek a withholding tax
on undeclared German assets in its banks along the lines of a
recently signed German-Swiss tax agreement,  Die Zeit  reported.  Liechtenstein’s government is in talks with  Germany ’s
 Finance Ministry  about an agreement and Tschuetscher said he
prefers new rules to take effect next year at the same time as
the Swiss accord, he told the newspaper in an interview. There
should be no regulatory gaps between Switzerland and
Liechtenstein with respect to Germany, he said.  “Liechtenstein should in no way profit from a German-Swiss
regulation,” he said.  German and Swiss officials signed an accord last month that
foresees a levy on German assets in Swiss accounts that
preserves an element of Swiss banking secrecy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
