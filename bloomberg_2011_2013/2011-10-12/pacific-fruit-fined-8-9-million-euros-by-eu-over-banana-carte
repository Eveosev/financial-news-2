Firma Leon Van Parys NV’s Pacific
Fruit unit was fined 8.9 million euros ($12.3 million) for
fixing banana prices in an antitrust case brought to the
European Union’s attention by  Chiquita Brands International Inc. (CQB)   Chiquita, the world’s biggest banana producer, wasn’t
punished because it was first to tell regulators about price-
fixing in Italy, Greece and  Portugal  from July 2004 to April
2005, the European Commission said in an e-mailed statement.  “Companies need to be aware that the commission takes its
anti-cartel enforcement duties very seriously,” said  Joaquin Almunia , the EU’s competition commissioner. “There are only two
ways to avoid a fine: refrain from joining a cartel or, if you
have fallen for it, repent rapidly and inform the commission
about it.”  Chiquita, based in Cincinnati, avoided EU fines for blowing
the whistle in a similar case in 2008. Dole Food Co. and Fresh
Del Monte Produce Inc. were fined about 60 million euros for
fixing the price of bananas with Chiquita. The two companies
rejected claims that they shared commercially sensitive
information, arguing that they were required to exchange trade
data under the EU’s system of setting import volumes and duties.  Pacific Fruit, based in Antwerp,  Belgium , and owned by
Firma Leon Van Parys, declined to comment. It imports bananas to
 Europe  using the brand name Bonita. Chiquita is “pleased to
have this issue concluded,” Ed Loyd, a spokesman for Chiquita,
said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
