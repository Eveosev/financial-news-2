Canadaâ€™s new-home price index rose
for a fifth month in August led by a gain in Toronto, the
government statistics agency said.  The index advanced 0.1 percent matching the July increase,
 Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. The August increase was
also the same as the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey with
14 responses.  Prices in Toronto and Oshawa, which make up 27 percent of
the index, rose 0.2 percent. Vancouver prices fell 0.4 percent,
tempering its rise.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  tightened mortgage rules to
check record consumer debts earlier this year, and said
Canadians should ensure they can afford to finance their homes
because  interest rates  will rise at some point.  From a year earlier, new-home prices increased 2.3 percent
in August, matching the July rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
