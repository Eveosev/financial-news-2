OPEC members pumped less crude oil
in September as Saudi Arabia cut its production from August’s
30-year high and  Nigeria ’s output was hindered by sabotage
attacks, the  International Energy Agency  said.  Daily supply from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries’ 12 members fell to 30.15 million barrels a day in
September from 30.17 million in August, the Paris-based IEA said
today in its monthly oil market report.  The decline was partly offset by the resumption of Libyan
production, the IEA said. The North African country’s output
averaged 75,000 barrels a day last month, and “production from
four fields brought online so far reached an estimated 350,000
barrels a day in early October.”  Libyan “production now looks on track to reach an average
400,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2011, with year-
end output closer to 600,000 barrels a day,” it said. That
compares with an earlier forecast of 350,000 to 400,000 barrels
a day by the end of this year, the IEA said.  Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest crude exporter, pumped
9.6 million barrels a day last month, compared with 9.8 million
in August.  Nigeria daily supplies were 100,000 barrels less at 2.18
million barrels, “following a series of pipeline outages on the
Bonny and Forcados network due to sabotage and oil theft”, the
IEA said.  Kuwait , Iraq Production  Daily output from Kuwait and the  United Arab Emirates  rose
to three-year highs. The two countries pumped 2.55 million
barrels a day each last month. Iraqi production climbed to 2.74
million barrels a day, the highest level in almost 10 years,
according to the IEA.  Production from the 11 OPEC members bound by quotas,
excluding  Iraq , dropped to 27.41 barrels a day in September from
a revised 27.49 million in August. That implies a compliance
rate of 39 percent with OPEC’s output targets, from 37 percent
in August.  OPEC, provider of about 40 percent of the world’s crude,
set its biggest-ever supply cuts in late 2008 amid a collapse in
global demand. The decision capped production at 24.845 million
barrels a day for all members except Iraq, which is exempt from
the quota system. Members have largely exceeded quotas this year
as they sought to take advantage of higher global crude prices
earlier this year and to make up for the lack of Libyan crude.  Compliance percentages are based on combined output from
the 11 members that committed to reduce from a base production
rate in September 2008 of 29.045 million barrels a day.  OPEC’s members are  Algeria , Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq,
Kuwait,  Libya , Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
