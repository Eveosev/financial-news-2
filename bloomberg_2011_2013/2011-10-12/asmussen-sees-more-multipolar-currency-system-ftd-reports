German Deputy Finance Minister  Joerg Asmussen  said he expects a more “multipolar” currency system
in the future, Financial Times Deutschland reported, citing an
interview.  “The U.S. dollar will remain the most important reserve
currency for the foreseeable future but its relative weight will
diminish,” he was quoted as saying. Asmussen this week won the
support of the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary
Affairs Committee to succeed Juergen Stark at the European
Central Bank’s Executive Board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
