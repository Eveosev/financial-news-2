President  Barack Obama  vowed to keep
pressing Congress to vote on individual components of the jobs
plan that was blocked in the Senate last night.  “We will not take ‘no’ for an answer,” Obama said today
at an American Latino Heritage Forum sponsored by the White
House and the Interior Department.  Voting on provisions of the legislation separately will
force Republican lawmakers to go on record in support of or
opposition to tax cuts, aiding teachers and repairing the
nation’s infrastructure, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
