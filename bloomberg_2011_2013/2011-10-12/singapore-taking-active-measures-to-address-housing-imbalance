Singaporeâ€™s government said it is
taking active measures to address a temporary imbalance in
supply and demand in the public housing market, including
building more homes and accelerating their completion.  It will also study expanding heath-care subsidies for the
needy, the government said in a statement elaborating on plans
laid out by President Tony Tan in parliament earlier this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
