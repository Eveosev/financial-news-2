Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index rose,
capping its longest winning streak since May, as Chinese
financial shares extended gains, and as metal producers advanced.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the nation’s No. 2 lender by
market value, rose 2.5 percent, climbing for a second day after
a mainland sovereign wealth fund started buying bank shares.
Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the nation’s biggest producer of
the resource by market value, surged 8.5 percent after metal
prices rose.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330)  fell 7.5 percent after a
report the clothier overstated the number of its stores.  The Hang Seng Index rose 1 percent to 18,329.46, advancing
for a fifth day, the gauge’s longest winning streak since May 31.
More than three stocks rose for each that fell on the 46-member
index. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese
companies listed in Hong Kong rose 2.1 percent to 9,455.84.  “People aren’t too bullish or bearish right now, but we
may have some recovery from here,” said  Alex Wong , asset-
management director at Ample Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong. “There
is some room for upside” because market has been oversold in
recent weeks, he said.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  sank 20 percent this year, making it
the worst performing developed-market benchmark index outside
the  euro zone . Shares declined on concern China will maintain
its tightening measures and  Europe ’s debt crisis will spread,
damping global demand.  Banks Extend Gains  Companies on the index traded at 9.9 times forecast
earnings, around March 2009 levels. That compares with 12 times
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  China Construction Bank gained 2.5 percent to HK$5.24.
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s biggest
lender by market value, rose 1.2 percent to HK$4.36, and
Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s No. 3, rose 2.3
percent to HK$3.06.  Financial shares surged yesterday after  China ’s state-run
Central Huijin Investment Ltd. started buying shares in the
nation’s four biggest banks, according to a statement on the
fund’s website.  “Valuations, particularly for Chinese banks, are certainly
cheap,” said  Pauline Dan , Hong Kong-based chief investment
officer at Samsung Asset Management, which oversees about $72
billion. “China’s purchases of banking shares is sending a
message to investors that we’re nearing the floor. While non-
performing loans of Chinese banks could rise, they have stronger
balance sheets to weather the increase.”  Aluminum Corp. of China advanced 8.5 percent to HK$4.07.
Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No. 1 producer of the metal, rose
3.3 percent to HK$15.22, while Minmetals Resources Ltd. gained
4.8 percent to HK$3.26.  Copper Price Rises  Aluminum for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange gained as much as 0.6 percent. Copper climbed as much
as 1.6 percent, reversing an earlier decline of 1.7 percent.  Ping An Insurance Group Co. rose 8 percent to HK$50.20
after UBS AG raised the insurer’s rating to “buy” from
“neutral.”  CSR Corp., a mainland maker of railway equipment, surged 14
percent to HK$3.44. The 21st Century Business Herald said CSR’s
parent and another company may get 4 billion yuan ($628 million)
from the government, citing an unidentified person familiar with
the matter.  China Railway Group Ltd. (390) , a builder of the nation’s
railroads, jumped 8.7 percent to HK$1.88.  Shimao, Esprit  Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. (813) , which gets all its sales
from the mainland, gained 6.3 percent to HK$6.78 after saying
contracted sales rose 25 percent in the nine months through
September from a year earlier.  Among stocks that fell, Esprit tumbled 7.5 percent to
HK$10.18 after Next Magazine, a local publication, said out of
37 directly operated stores and 35 department-store counters in
 Shanghai  listed by the retailer, seven don’t exist and 13
couldn’t be reached. Patrick Lau, Esprit’s investor relations
vice president, wasn’t immediately available for comment.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index gained 2.5 percent to 18,445.
The HSI Volatility Index lost 8 percent to 35.34, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 10 percent in the Hang Seng
Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
