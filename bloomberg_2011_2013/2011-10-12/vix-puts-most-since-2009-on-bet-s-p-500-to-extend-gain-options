Traders are placing more bets than
any time since 2009 that the  Chicago  Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index will fall, a sign they expect concern about
 Europe ’s credit crisis to recede and the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index to rally.  There are 101 puts to sell the VIX for every 100 calls,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s up from 70 on
Sept. 22. Yesterday’s largest trade was for November 25 puts,
which pay if futures on the VIX, which derives its value from
S&P 500 options, fall 25 percent through the end of next month.
The index fell below 30 intraday today for the first time since
Aug. 5, before the U.S. lost its top credit rating from S&P.  Pledges by German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  to do “everything necessary” to
ensure European banks have enough capital are helping build
confidence in equity markets. Increased speculation the VIX will
fall follows a 9.2 percent retreat in the gauge this week
through yesterday, and a 3.5 percent gain in the  S&P 500 .  “They’re bets on a return to some semblance of
normality,” according to Jeremy Wien, a VIX options trader at
Peak6 Investments LP, which oversees about $1 billion in
Chicago. “Things were really looking dismal into last week, and
as the market turned around, so did sentiment. We’re seeing lots
of VIX put buying, and buyers in much bigger size.”  Biggest Rally  The last time there were this many VIX puts in relation to
calls was January 2009, two months before the S&P 500 began the
biggest rally in seven decades. The gauge of 30-day S&P 500
options has stayed above 30 since Aug. 4, compared with its 21-
year average of 20.48. It retreated 4.9 percent to 31.26 today,
dropping for a seventh day straight for the longest losing
streak since March. In Europe, the  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures
the cost of Euro Stoxx 50 Index options, fell 6.3 percent to
35.77 today, its lowest level since Aug. 31.  The S&P 500 plunged 19 percent between April 29 and Oct. 3,
with losses accelerating after July 22 amid speculation the U.S.
government would lose its top credit rating. S&P cut the ranking
to AA+ from AAA on Aug. 5.  The  stock index  then rose 8.7 percent through Oct. 10, the
most over five days since the  bull market  began in March 2009,
on optimism European leaders will take action to solve the
region’s debt crisis. Merkel and Sarkozy gave themselves three
weeks on Oct. 9 to devise a plan to recapitalize banks, get
 Greece  on the right track and fix Europe’s economic governance.  “Investors don’t want to bet as hard against the market
because the market pulled back quite severely,”  Lawrence Creatura , a Rochester, New York-based fund manager at  Federated
Investors Inc. (FII) , said in a telephone interview yesterday. The
firm oversees about $350 billion. “Although we have our
challenges, both domestically and globally, the sky is not
exactly falling just yet.”  Fear Barometer  Another gauge of concern among options investors fell to a
two-year low as investors pay more for contracts that gain in
value when equities rally. The Credit Suisse Fear Barometer, a
gauge of prices to sell three-month S&P 500 calls while buying
puts, has tumbled to 19.65. It slipped to 17.54 on Oct. 3, the
lowest level since October 2009.  “People looking at the VIX would have missed the message
that sentiment had turned,” said Mandy Xu, an equity
derivatives strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in  New York .
“As the market sold off going into the end of September and the
VIX surged higher, investors were actually selling out of their
put protection and positioning for a rally.”  In yesterday’s largest VIX options trade, an investor
bought a block of 55,550 November 25 puts for 40 cents each,
according to a report from Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based
provider of options-market data and analytics. That’s a bet the
November future will settle below 24.60 before Nov. 16. It
accounted for 9.4 percent of the day’s trading in VIX options.  Less Volatility  “People are increasingly willing to sell the upside in VIX
and buy the downside,” Michael Khouw, director of U.S. equity
derivatives trading at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, said yesterday in a
telephone interview from  San Francisco . “As long as we can hold
off on a huge bomb going off, you’re going to see lower
volatility in the indices.”  VIX futures indicate options will remain elevated into next
year. Futures for every month through May were priced at 32.05,
which is 56 percent above the gauge’s 21-year average, or higher
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The VIX will stay high until European leaders announce
concrete steps to solve the sovereign debt crisis,  Andrew Wilkinson , chief economic strategist at New York-based Miller
Tabak & Co., said in a telephone interview yesterday.  ‘People Saying Nothing’  “Merkel and Sarkozy came out over the weekend and said
something, but they didn’t actually say anything, and that has
been the problem for 18 months,” he said. “The rally was built
upon an edifice of people saying nothing.”  When the S&P 500 lost 57 percent from October 2007 to March
2009, the VIX tripled. The options indicator rose to a record
close of 80.86 in November 2008, two months after Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy, and closed above 30
every day between Sept. 15, 2008, and May 18, 2009.  This year, the highest VIX close was 48 on Aug. 8, the
first trading session after S&P cut the U.S. government’s  credit
rating . The index has exceeded 30 since Aug. 4.  The S&P 500 is rebounding from an 18 percent drop between
July 22 and Oct. 3 that brought it within 1 percent of a  bear
market , or 20 percent slump from its April 29 peak. During the
past week, the fastest growing VIX bets were November 25 puts
and November 26 puts, with open interest climbing by 30,595
contracts and 19,963 contracts, respectively, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’ve seen heightened interest” in puts betting the VIX
will fall, Dominic Salvino, a specialist on the CBOE floor for
Group One Trading, the primary market maker for options on the
index, said in an e-mail yesterday. “People are starting to
position for the possibility of a return to normalcy.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
