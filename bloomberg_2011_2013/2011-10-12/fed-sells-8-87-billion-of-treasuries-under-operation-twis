(Corrects the maturity reference in the first paragraph.)  The  Federal Reserve  sold $8.87
billion in Treasury securities due in two years or less as part
of its plan to lower borrowing costs that’s become known as
Operation Twist.  The central bank sold debt maturing from March 2013 to
October 2013, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of  New
York ’s  website .  The Fed is replacing $400 billion of short-term debt in its
portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an effort to reduce
borrowing costs further and counter rising risks of a recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
