Poland  has taken adequate steps to
correct its budget deficit and narrow the shortfall to within
the European Union’s 3 percent of  gross domestic product  limit
this year, the European Commission said.  The Polish government has taken “effective action” after
a warning by the commission on Nov. 10 that the country was at
risk of not meeting its obligation to reduce the shortfall to
within the bloc’s ceiling, the commission, the EU’s executive
arm in Brussels, said today.  “Our assessment is that Poland does not have an excessive
deficit in 2012,” Rehn told reporters.  The government of the EU’s largest  eastern  economy has
struggled since 2008 to control public finances, with the  budget
deficit  ballooning to 7.8 percent of GDP in 2010 and public debt
hovering near a 55 percent of GDP legal threshold that would
prompt mandatory austerity measures. The commission gave Poland
until 2012 to exit its excessive-deficit procedure by cutting
its shortfall to the required threshold.  Raising Revenue  Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who won a second term in
October, will reduce tax incentives, raise employers’ social-
security contributions and increase levies on metals extraction
to narrow 2012  budget gap  to 2.9 percent of GDP this year. The
government is also pushing for more revenue from state-owned
companies and asset sales to compensate for slowing growth.  The government estimates economic growth may slow to 2.5
percent this year as euro-region economies, which buy 54 percent
of Polish exports, struggle with a debt crisis.  Poland was the only member of the 27-nation EU to avoid a
recession in 2009 as its larger internal market offset waning
external demand. The  economy expanded  4.2 percent from a year
ago in the third quarter.  Poland risked sanctions from the EU, which warned it would
reduce the country’s eligibility for the bloc’s funding that
helped generate growth in 2009, should the government fail to
meet its deficit reduction obligations.  The government’s plan to narrow the budget deficit by 2.7
percentage points this year may fail as the global economic
outlook sours and the government relies too much on raising
revenue, the Narodowy Bank Polski said on Dec. 22. The central
bank-led Monetary Policy Council estimates the 2012 shortfall
will fall to 3.9 percent of GDP.  Tusk’s government also plans to trim general government
debt to 56 percent of GDP this year from 56.7 percent last year
and then gradually reduce it to 50.2 percent in 2015.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
