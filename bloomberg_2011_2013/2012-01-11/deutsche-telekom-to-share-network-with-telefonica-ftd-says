Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  is close to an
agreement to make its fiber-optic network available to Spanish
rival  Telefonica SAâ€™s (TEF)  German unit, the  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported in a preview of a story to be published
tomorrow, without saying where it got the information.  Telefonica and its O2 brand want to share the cost of fiber
networks to provide faster long-term evolution or LTE
technology, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
