Bill Templer and Richard Evans,
managing directors at Morgan Stanley’s equities unit in  London 
were among bankers who left the firm this week, a person with
knowledge of the matter said, as the sovereign debt crisis
erodes trading profit in the industry.  Templer was the co-head of listed derivatives and Evans
worked for Delta One strategy, the person said, declining to be
identified as the details aren’t public. The Delta One desk
handles trades for clients, typically helping them to speculate
on, or hedge the performance of, a basket of securities.  Morgan Stanley said last month it planned to eliminate
1,600 jobs because of an industrywide drop in revenue from
investment banking and trading. The cuts amount to about 2.6
percent of the New York-based bank’s employees at the end of
September. The job losses will take place in the first quarter
at all levels,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  said.  A spokesman for the bank in London declined to comment on
the departures today. Templer and Evans didn’t pick up calls to
their office. The Financial Times reported the story earlier
today.  Financial-services firms have scaled back and shut
divisions that trade equities in  Europe  as the region’s debt
crisis trimmed profitability last year. UniCredit SpA,  Italy ’s
largest bank, shuttered its western European equities unit in
November, joining at least five other firms including, Nomura
Holdings Inc., that eliminated equities staff in Europe last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
