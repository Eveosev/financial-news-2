Lebanon’s budget deficit narrowed in
the first 10 months of 2011 because of increased revenue from
telecommunications.  The shortfall narrowed to 2.28 trillion Lebanese pounds
($1.5 billion) at the end of October from 3.78 trillion pounds a
year earlier, the Ministry of Finance said today in an e-mailed
statement from  Beirut .  The ministry included estimated revenue of 1.8 trillion
pounds from the Telecommunications Ministry in its calculations,
up from 331 billion pounds in the first 10 months of 2010. The
funds haven’t yet been transferred to the Treasury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
