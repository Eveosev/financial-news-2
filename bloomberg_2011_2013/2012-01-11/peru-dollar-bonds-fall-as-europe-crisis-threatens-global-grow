Peru ’s benchmark dollar bonds fell,
pushing up yields the most in eight weeks, as concern that
Europe’s debt crisis may curb global growth cut demand for
higher-yielding assets.  The yield on the nation’s 6.55 percent dollar-denominated
bond due March 2037 rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 4.82 percent at 10:13 a.m. in Lima. That’s the
steepest increase on a closing basis since Nov. 21. The bond’s
price fell 0.79 cent to 125 cents per dollar.  Stocks fell in Europe and the U.S. after Spanish industrial
production shrank the most in two years in November and
Germany’s Federal Statistics Office said the economy probably
shrank in the fourth quarter from the third.  “The dynamics in Peru’s external debt are aligned with the
global context,” said  Roberto Melzi , a strategist at Barclays
Capital Inc. in New York. “Europe remains the main threat to
global growth.”  The sol fell 0.1 percent to 2.6950 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.6925 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
