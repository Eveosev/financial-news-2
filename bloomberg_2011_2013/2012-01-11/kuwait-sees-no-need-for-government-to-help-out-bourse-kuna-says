Kuwait’s government has no plans to
support the country’s stock exchange by purchasing shares,
state-run news agency  KUNA  reported, citing Finance Minister
Mustafa al-Shimali.  There is no need for the government to help the bourse
“given existing concerns about investing in the market, and
that conditions will return to normal once the global economic
situation stabilizes and political circumstances improve,” he
said, according to KUNA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
