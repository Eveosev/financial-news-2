Ferrox Holdings Ltd.  agreed to sell
as much as a 20 percent stake to the first black South African
central bank governor and his brother as the company seeks to
raise $150 million to start its  iron-ore  project in the nation.  Ferrox, based in the British Virgin Islands, signed a
memorandum of understanding to sell a stake in the company or
some of its units in  South Africa  for $32 million to Mboweni
Brothers Investment Holdings (Pty) Ltd., founded by former
governor Tito Mboweni and brother Alto, it said in an e-mailed
statement. It plans to raise $150 million in working capital for
the Tivani site in Limpopo province during the next 12 months.  The Mbowenis share a “commitment to advance the Tivani
project -- one of the most significant deposits of its kind in
South Africa -- into a major African iron-ore producer,” Ferrox
Chief Executive Officer David McAdam said in the statement.  Tivani output is scheduled to begin in two years, with full
annual production of about 2.5 million metric tons of iron ore
concentrate expected in three to four years, Ferrox said. It’s
also studying output of ilmenite, used to produce titanium.  Mboweni, who quit as central bank governor in 2009, is
chairman of AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., the third-biggest miner of
the metal, and Nampak Ltd.,  Africa ’s largest packaging company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
