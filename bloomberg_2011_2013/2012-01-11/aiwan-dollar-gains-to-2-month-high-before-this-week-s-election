Taiwan ’s dollar rose to the
strongest level in more than two months after global funds
boosted holdings of the island’s shares on optimism President Ma
Ying-jeou will get reelected on Jan. 14.  The currency advanced for a seventh day after overseas
investors bought $402 million more local equities than they sold
in the past three days, according to exchange data. Taiwan will
vote for a new president over the weekend, with Tsai Ing-Wen,
chairwoman of the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party ,
contesting against Ma, who is chairman of the Kuomintang party.  “It’s very unusual for foreign funds to come in at this
time of the year as the Chinese New Year is just around the
corner,” said Tarsicio Tong, a currency trader at Union Bank of
Taiwan in Taipei. “Maybe there’s some optimism that the
incumbent Kuomintang will win, and investors are looking forward
to a stock rally on Monday.”  The island’s dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$29.999
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
reached NT$29.904 earlier, the strongest level since Nov. 1.
