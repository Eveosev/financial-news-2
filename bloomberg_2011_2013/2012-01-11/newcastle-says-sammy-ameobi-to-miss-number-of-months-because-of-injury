Newcastle United said forward Sammy
Ameobi will miss “a number of months” after injuring himself
during a reserves match against Wigan.  The 19-year-old was hurt in the second half and came out of
the game, the team said today on its website. The England
under-21 player started one game and appeared in 12 others for
Newcastle this season.  He “will be sidelined for a period of time, likely to be a
number of months,” the team said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
