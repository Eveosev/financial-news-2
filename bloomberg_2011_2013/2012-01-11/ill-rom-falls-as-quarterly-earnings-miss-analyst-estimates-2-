Hill-Rom Holdings Inc. (HRC) , which makes
products for patient handling in acute care, fell the most since
July after reporting preliminary results that missed analyst
estimates.  Hill-Rom fell 12 percent to $30.50 at 4 p.m. Earnings for
the first quarter ended Dec. 31 were 52 to 53 cents a share, the
Batesville, Indiana-based company said in a statement yesterday.
Analysts had estimated 56 cents in a survey by Bloomberg.  The results “represent a bit of a slow start to 2012,”
said Matt Miksic, an analyst for Piper Jaffray Cos. in New York
with an “overweight” rating on Hill-Rom.  The company’s growth in  emerging markets  didn’t make up for
weaker European and North American sales as hospital clients cut
spending, he said in a note to investors today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
