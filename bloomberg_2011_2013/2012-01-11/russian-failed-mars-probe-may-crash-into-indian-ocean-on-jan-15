Russia’s failed Mars probe may crash
into the  Indian Ocean  on Jan. 15, the space agency Roscosmos
said.  The spacecraft may fall to Earth at 1:18 p.m. Moscow time
(9:18 a.m. GMT), Roscosmos said in a  statement  on its website
today.  Some 20 to 30 fragments weighing no more than 200 kilograms
(441 pounds) will reach the earth’s surface, the space agency
said in December.  The $163 million Phobos-Grunt, designed to return soil
samples from Phobos, one of two Martian moons, became stuck in
low-earth orbit after its Nov. 9 launch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
