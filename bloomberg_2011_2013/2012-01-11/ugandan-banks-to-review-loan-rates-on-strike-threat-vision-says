Uganda â€™s commercial banks offered to
review  interest rates  on old loans, which rose after the central
bank increased its lending rates,  New Vision  reported, citing
Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi.  Lenders are reviewing rates to save some businesses, secure
properties offered as collateral and protect salary earners, the
Kampala-based newspaper reported. Banks made the offer after a
meeting with members of the Kampala City Traders Association,
who threatened to strike to demand lower interest rates and
easier access to credit, according to  New Vision .  Interest rates on old loans were increased after the
central bank raised its key rate by 10 percentage points from to
23 percent in November, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
