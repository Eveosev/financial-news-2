Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN) , manager of
the Franklin and Templeton mutual funds, fell the most in more
than two months after assets under management declined in
December.  Franklin dropped 5 percent, the most since Nov. 9, to close
at $96.67 in New York trading. Assets under management declined
to $670.3 billion at the end of December from $675.8 billion in
the previous month,  San Mateo , California-based Franklin said
yesterday.  Global bond assets, the key driver in Franklin’s growth
over the past two years, declined to $174.7 billion from $179.4
billion on Nov. 30. Investors pulled $1.8 billion from the $58
billion Templeton Global Bond Fund in November and December, the
first redemptions in three years after performance lagged behind
rivals, according to data compiled by  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  The fund
attracted $15 billion in net deposits in the first 10 months of
2011, according to the Chicago-based research firm.  A reversal in the growth of global fixed-income products
“could greatly impact results negatively,” Jonathan Casteleyn,
an analyst with Susquehanna International Group LLP, wrote in a
note to clients yesterday. He maintained his “neutral” rating
on the stock.  Franklin was cut to “market perform” from “outperform”
by Robert Lee, an equity analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. It
was cut to “neutral” from “buy” by William Katz, an analyst
with Citigroup Global Markets Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
