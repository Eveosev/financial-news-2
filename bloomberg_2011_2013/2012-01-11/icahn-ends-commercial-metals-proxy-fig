Billionaire Investor  Carl Icahn  is
ending his proxy fight against the board of  Commercial Metals
Co. (CMC)  after his tender offer received 23 percent of the
steelmaker’s shares, less than the 40.1 percent he sought.  “We respect the views of the shareholders and hopefully
their decision not to tender will prove to be the right one,”
Icahn, Chairman of New York-based Icahn Enterprises Holdings LP,
said today in a statement.  Getting 40.1 percent or more of the stock would have given
Icahn a majority when combined with his current stake of about
10 percent. Icahn offered $15 apiece for the rest of Irving,
Texas-based Commercial Metals. The shares fell 4.8 percent to
$14.05 at 11:17 a.m. in  New York .  Icahn, who announced his $1.56 billion offer in November,
said he would sell Commercial Metals’ “non-core” assets,
appoint new management and combine the company with his existing
metals-recycling assets. Commercial Metals said the bid was too
low and that it planned to raise profits by shutting a steel
mill in  Croatia  and rebar-fabrication plants and reducing its
global workforce.  Commercial Metals distributes steel and also collects scrap
that it melts to make products such as rebar used in
construction. It has  dropped  42 percent in the past five years
while the the Standard and Poor’s Midcap Materials Index has
increased 30 percent.  Icahn, 75, who often buys distressed companies, started his
metals business through the acquisition of Philip Services
Corp., a bankrupt Canadian scrap metals and industrial-services
company, in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
