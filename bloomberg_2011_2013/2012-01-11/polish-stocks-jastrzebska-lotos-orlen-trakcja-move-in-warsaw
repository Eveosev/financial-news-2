Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  declined 0.2
percent to 2,132.99 at 3:06 p.m. in Warsaw, falling for a second
time this week.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA (JSW)  (JSW PW) rose for the first
time in five days, increasing 1.6 percent to 89.7 zloty after
Poland’s largest coking coal producer released reserves for
local taxes. Releasing reserves will add about 290 million zloty
($83 million) to 2011 profit, the company said in a regulatory
statement today.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN)  , Poland’s largest oil company, fell
0.9 percent to 34.3 zloty and  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the
second-largest refiner, lost 0.3 percent to 21.45 zloty. Oil
fell from near the highest settlement in almost a week amid
concern that a shrinking German economy may drag Europe into a
recession, reducing demand.  Trakcja-Tiltra SA (TRK)  , Poland’s biggest publicly
traded rail building company, rose 1 percent to 1 zloty,
extending this week’s gain to 41 percent as Citigroup Inc.
upgraded the stock to “buy” from “sell.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
