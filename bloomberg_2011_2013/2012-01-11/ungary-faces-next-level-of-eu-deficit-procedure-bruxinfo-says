The European Commission will today
propose to advance the so-called excessive deficit procedure
against  Hungary  to a higher level, the website  Bruxinfo  reported
yesterday, without saying where it obtained the information.  The European Union’s executive arm will propose the step
because Hungary hasn’t acted on the proposals made by EU finance
ministers in 2009 and because the country’s budget deficit may
exceed the 3 percent of gross domestic product limit in 2013,
Bruxinfo said.  The Commission will state that Hungary hasn’t taken
adequate steps to correct the excessive deficit and may move
closer to withholding subsidies from the country in punishment,
Bruxinfo added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
