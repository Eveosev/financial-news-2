Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG) , 2011’s best-
performing stock in the  Standard & Poor’s 500  index, led
declines by natural-gas producers today as price for the heating
fuel fell to a 28-month low on a mild weather forecast.  Cabot, based in Houston, fell 10.5 percent to $70.15 at
3:08 p.m. in New York, today’s worst performance by an S&P 500
energy stock.  Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN) ,  Range Resources Corp. (RRC)  and
 QEP Resources Inc. (QEP) , which also produce more gas than oil, fell
more than 6 percent.  Gas contracts for February delivery fell as much as 6.8
percent on the New York Mercantile Exchange to $2.74 a million
British thermal units, the lowest intraday price since September
2009, after the National Weather Service forecast above-normal
temperatures from the Rocky Mountains to the East Coast Jan. 18
through Jan. 24.  Cabot shares doubled in 2011 to $75.90 as output rose.
Production from the Marcellus Shale, a gas-rich deposit near U.S.
East Coast markets, more than doubled to 600 million cubic feet
a day before royalties during the final two days of 2011.  The U.S. benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, fell 1.3
percent to $100.92 at 2:35 p.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
