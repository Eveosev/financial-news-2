The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission completed Dodd-Frank Act regulations to protect swap
traders’ collateral that is used to reduce risk in trades.  CFTC commissioners voted 4-1 today to complete the rule,
which gained urgency after as much as $1.2 billion in client
funds went missing as  MF Global Holdings Ltd (MFGLQ) . collapsed last
year. The CFTC, Securities and Exchange Commission,  Justice
Department  and bankruptcy trustee are investigating if funds
were misused before the New York-based broker filed for
 bankruptcy protection  Oct. 31.  The rule approved today seeks to insulate clients’
collateral if their broker defaults, while also allowing the
customer funds to be pooled before a bankruptcy, according to a
CFTC summary.  Moore Capital Management LP, Paulson & Co. Inc., Fidelity
Investments, Tudor Investment Corp. and  Och-Ziff Capital
Management Group LLC (OZM)  had urged the CFTC to adopt tougher
standards than those completed today. The CFTC should allow
investors the option to set aside collateral in separate
accounts at third-party banks instead of allowing the funds to
be pooled, the investment firms said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
