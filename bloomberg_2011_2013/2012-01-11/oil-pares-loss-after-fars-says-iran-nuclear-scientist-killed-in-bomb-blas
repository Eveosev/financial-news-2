Oil pared its decline in  New York 
after Iran’s Fars news agency reported that an Iranian nuclear
scientist was killed in a bomb explosion in northern Tehran.  Crude for February delivery was at $102.02 a barrel, down
22 cents, at 2:33 p.m. Singapore time, after earlier sliding as
much as 64 cents.  Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, a director at the Natanz uranium 
enrichment facility in Isfahan province and a professor at 
Tehran’s technical university, was killed when a person on a
motorcycle placed a magnetic bomb under his car, Fars said.
Two other people were hurt in the blast, the agency said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
