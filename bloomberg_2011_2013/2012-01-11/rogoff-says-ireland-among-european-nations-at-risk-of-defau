Ireland is among the European
countries apart from  Greece  that are at risk of defaulting on
their debt, Harvard University economist  Kenneth Rogoff  said.  While Ireland, which got a 67.5 billion-euro ($86 billion)
bailout from the  International Monetary Fund  and the European
Union in 2010, has “done a lot of great things” to restructure
its economy, it isn’t immune to the “trauma” that is still
occurring in  Europe , Rogoff, whose work has examined the history
of sovereign defaults, told reporters in Bangkok today.  “There’s talk in Europe about ‘Maybe Greece, but everybody
else is just perfect, we don’t have a problem besides Greece’,”
Rogoff said, referring to the possibility of defaults. “All of
my work suggests that would be a very, very, very fortunate
outcome.”  Greece is in final negotiations to persuade investors to
forgive at least half of its debt, the euro area’s first large-
scale restructuring. Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  expects to
have an outline for the 100 billion-euro plan next week, when
talks on the terms for a second financing deal with EU and IMF
officials start in Athens.  “Most countries default long before they really couldn’t
pay,” Rogoff said. “They choose to default. That’s clearly the
case with Greece today.”  Rogoff is the co-author, with Carmen M. Reinhart, of “This
Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly,” a
history of financial crises that focuses on government defaults.  To contact the reporters on this story:
