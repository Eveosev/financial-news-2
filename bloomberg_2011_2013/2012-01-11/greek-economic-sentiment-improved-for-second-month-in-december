Greek economic sentiment improved
for a second month in December after the formation of an interim
government stabilized the country’s political situation.  An index measuring short-term economic trends rose to 70.4
from 68.6 in November, the Athens-based  Foundation for Economic
& Industrial Research  said in an e-mailed report today. In
October the index sank to 67.5, its lowest level in more than
two years.  Consumer confidence improved to minus 81.9 from minus 82.3
in November, the foundation said. Sentiment in the industrial
sector dropped to 70.9 from 72.6, reaching its lowest level
since April 2009. In the service sector, sentiment declined to a
new record low, dropping to 55.2 from 56.5.  Lucas Papademos, a former vice president of the  European
Central Bank , became Greece’s prime minister in November in an
interim administration charged with implementing decisions
linked with a second bailout for Greece agreed on at an Oct. 26
European Union summit. His predecessor,  George Papandreou ,
roiled markets with an aborted plan to hold a referendum on the
rescue plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
