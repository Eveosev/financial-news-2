Western Canada Select oil weakened
to the largest discount to West Texas Intermediate since July as
higher oil imports into the U.S. Midwest and lower product
prices threatened to cut refining margins.  The heavy grade sank 16 percent after producers such as
 Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  and Syncrude Canada Ltd. reported a rise in
December production from the previous month. Exxon Mobil Corp.
reported Jan. 5 a compressor associated with a coker at the
Joliet refinery in  Illinois  shut.  Crude imports to the Midwest jumped 12 percent last week,
Energy Department data show. Gasoline and diesel in the region
tumbled to the lowest levels since March.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount to WTI widened $2.90 a
barrel to $21 at 3:48 p.m. according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS) ’s discount widened 20 cents to $3 below WTI.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  Among Gulf Coast grades,  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to
West Texas Intermediate added 25 cents to $10.75 a barrel.  Heavy
Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE) ’s premium gained 10 cents to $12.25 over the
U.S. benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium increased 60 cents to $11. Mars
Blend’s premium widened 80 cents to $8.50 over WTI.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s
premium added 50 cents to $8 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN)  added 75 cents to $7.75 over WTI.
