Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the world’s biggest
software company, sued Shanghai Gome Electrical Appliances Co.
in China, alleging the retailer had offered computers with
pirated versions of its Windows and Office programs.  The lawsuit against Gome was filed at the Shanghai Huangpu
District People’s Court, the Redmond, Washington-based company
said in an e-mailed statement dated Jan. 6. Separately,
Microsoft sued  Clevo Co. (2362) ’s Buynow retail unit at a court in
Beijing, according to the statement.  Microsoft is boosting efforts to counter unauthorized use
of its software in China, which surpassed the U.S. last year as
the world’s biggest market for personal computers. About 78
percent of software in China was pirated in 2010, according to
estimates by the Business Software Alliance.  Two computer vendors with stores in a Buynow mall in
Beijing were offering products with pirated Microsoft software,
the U.S. company said.  Philip Cheung, an investor relations manager at Hong Kong-
listed  Gome Electrical Appliances Holdings Ltd. (493) , couldn’t
confirm if Shanghai Gome is a unit of his company, or is
privately owned by founder Huang Guangyu. He declined to comment
on the case.  Buynow has measures to curb intellectual property
infringement by vendors at its malls, and “regrets” the legal
action by Microsoft, Buynow said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
