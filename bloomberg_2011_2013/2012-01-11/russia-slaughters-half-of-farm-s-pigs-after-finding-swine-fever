Russian authorities slaughtered
about half of the pigs at a farm in the country’s south after
finding African swine fever at the site, the government food-
safety watchdog said.  A total of 15,200 animals were killed at the farm in the
Krasnodarsky region’s Timashevsky district, Rosselkhoznadzor
 said  in a statement yesterday. There were 30,736 pigs at the
site, it said. Veterinary officials are taking steps to prevent
the virus from spreading, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
