Kenya ’s shilling appreciated for the
first time in four days on speculation the central bank’s
monetary policy committee will keep the benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at a meeting today.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained 0.1
percent to 87.23 at 1:16 p.m.  The committee, led by Governor Njuguna Ndung’u, will hold
the policy rate at a record 18 percent, according to five of six
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The Nairobi-based bank is
scheduled to announce its decision later today.  Kenya’s monetary policy committee raised the  policy rate  by
1.5 percentage points on Dec 1. to bolster the fight against
inflation after price increases surged more than double the
government’s target.  The Tanzanian shilling weakened for the first day in four
days on higher dollar demand from oil importers.  The currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 1,584 per dollar at
1:02 p.m. in  Dar es Salaam .  “The market has seen demand coming in from corporate
customers, particularly from the oil sector today,” Hamis
Mwakibete, head of trading for Commercial Bank of Africa
Tanzania Ltd., said in a phone interview from the commercial
capital.  Uganda’s currency remained unchanged at 2,455 per dollar.
