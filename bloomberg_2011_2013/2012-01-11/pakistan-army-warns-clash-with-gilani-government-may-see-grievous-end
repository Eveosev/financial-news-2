Pakistan’s parliament, summoned by
Prime Minister  Yousuf Raza Gilani  as he seeks support amid a
power struggle with the military, will limit today’s special
session to offering prayers for a lawmaker who died this week,
according to its website.  The ruling coalition convened the emergency sitting of the
National Assembly after the  Supreme Court  warned Jan. 10 that it
may charge Gilani with contempt for his government’s failure to
pursue corruption cases against President Asif Ali Zardari and
other officials.  In a separate development, Gilani and army chief Ashfaq
Parvez Kayani clashed yesterday over a Supreme Court probe into
a purported government memo seeking U.S. help to prevent a
possible military coup.  Gilani had been expected to ask for lawmakers’ support as
the two cases raised tensions between civilian and military
leaders to their highest level since the end of army rule in
2008.  -- Editor:  Mark Williams   To contact the reporters on this story:
