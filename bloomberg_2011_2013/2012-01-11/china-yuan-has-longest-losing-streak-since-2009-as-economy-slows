China ’s yuan had its longest losing
streak in more than two years on speculation policy makers will
slow currency appreciation as the outlook for growth in  Asia ’s
biggest economy dims.  Exports (CNFREXPY)  increased 13.4 percent last month from a year
earlier after climbing 13.8 percent in November, according to
official data released yesterday. The surplus in the current
account, a measure of trade and investment flows, was $53.4
billion in the third quarter of last year, the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange said today, revising an
earlier estimate of $57.8 billion.  “The yuan dropped as investors are getting more worried
about China’s economic growth and capital outflows,” said Banny Lam, a Hong Kong-based economist at CCB International Securities
Ltd. “The slowdown in export growth also adds to the
concerns.”  The yuan fell 0.01 percent to close at 6.3155 per dollar in
 Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The currency declined for a sixth day, the longest losing streak
since August 2009.  ‘Political Move’  The People’s Bank of China raised the currency’s reference
rate 0.03 percent to 6.3155 per dollar, coinciding with a visit
to the nation by U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner . The
U.S. official will hold talks with Premier  Wen Jiabao  today, two
weeks after the Treasury Department said in a report that the
yuan is “substantially undervalued” and the U.S. will “press
for policy changes that yield greater exchange-rate
flexibility.”  “The stronger fixing is a political move as Geithner is
visiting,” said Kenix Lai, a Hong Kong-based currency analyst
at Bank of East Asia Ltd.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan was little changed
at 6.3133. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.06
percent to 6.3190.  Consumer prices  rose 4 percent in December, the least since
September 2010, according to the median estimate of economists
in a Bloomberg survey before government data due tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
