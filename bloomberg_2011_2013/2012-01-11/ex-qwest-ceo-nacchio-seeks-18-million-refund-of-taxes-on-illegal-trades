Joseph Nacchio , the former  Qwest
Communications International Inc. (Q)  chairman convicted of  insider
trading , sued the U.S. seeking a refund of almost $18 million in
taxes he paid on gains from illegal stock sales.  In a lawsuit filed yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal
Claims in Washington, Nacchio said he and his wife are owed a
refund because court-ordered disgorgement of those gains wiped
out their tax liability.  Nacchio, 62, received a 70-month prison sentence after his
conviction in 2007 for selling stock in Denver-based Qwest in
2001 based on inside information. Nacchio of Rumson, New Jersey,
made more than $44 million on the sale, according to court
papers. CenturyLink Inc., a telecommunications company based in
Monroe,  Louisiana , bought Qwest last year for $24 billion.  The suit claims that “$44,632,464.38 was included in
plaintiffs’ gross income for tax year 2007 because it appeared
that the plaintiffs had an unrestricted right” to the money.
“As such, plaintiffs paid $17,999,030.00 in federal income
tax.”  In the criminal case, Nacchio was ordered to pay a
$19 million fine and forfeit $44.6 million.  The  Internal Revenue Service  rejected an earlier request
for a tax credit on Nacchio’s payment, claiming it would
“violate public policy as it would force a portion of the
penalty to be borne by the U.S. government,” according to a
letter from the IRS cited in the suit.  William Lipkind, Nacchio’s lawyer in the tax lawsuit,
didn’t immediately return a telephone message seeking comment on
the filing.  Grant Williams, an IRS spokesman, said federal law
prohibits the agency from discussing or commenting on any
particular taxpayer situation or case.  The case is Nacchio v. U.S., 12-00020, U.S. Court of
Federal Claims ( Washington ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
