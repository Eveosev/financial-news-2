TUI  France ,the country’s biggest
tour operator, is posting losses and expects a difficult year,
targeting profitability only in three years, La Tribune
reported, citing unit chief Pascal de Izaguirre.  De Izaguirre is “very pessimistic” about the year that’s
unfolding, particularly as election years in France portend
lower travel overseas, the newspaper reported. As the parent
company has  low debt  and is well positioned, the French unit
expects to gain market share in 2012, La Tribune reported,
citing de Izaguirre.  TUI’s Nouvelles Frontieres, Marmara, Tourinter and
Adventura operating units in France all merged on Jan. 1 to
create critical mass and lower overhead costs, the newspaper
cited de Izaguirre as saying. TUI France’s airline unit,
CorsairFly, plans to change its name in July, La Tribune cited
de Izaguirre as saying, without specifying the new brand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
