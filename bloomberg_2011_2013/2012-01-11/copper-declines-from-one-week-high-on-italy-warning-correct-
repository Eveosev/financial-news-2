Copper, little changed, may drop as
 Fitch Ratings ’ warning that it may downgrade  Italy ’s credit
rating raised concern over Europe’s economic growth, eroding
demand prospects for industrial metals.  The three-month contract on the  London  Metal Exchange fell
as much as 1.3 percent to $7,642.25 a metric ton and traded at
$7,750 by 4:16 p.m. Tokyo time. The March-delivery contract
gained 0.3 percent to $3.522 a pound on the Comex.  Italy faces a “significant chance” of a credit-rating
downgrade by Fitch Ratings, which is reviewing all European
sovereign ratings and will make a decision by the end of the
month. The euro weakened versus the dollar before a report that
may signal Europe’s debt crisis is hurting the region’s
prospects for economic growth. The euro lost as much as 0.4
percent to $1.2729.  “The market was under pressure from the European headline
that made the euro weaken against the dollar,” said Hwang Il Doo, a senior trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul .  Copper stockpiles tracked by the LME declined 0.4 percent
to 365,375 tons, the lowest level since Dec. 22, 2010, daily
exchange figures showed yesterday. Orders to draw the metal from
LME warehouses, or canceled warrants, gained 2 percent to 40,375
tons on an increase in Rotterdam.  Copper for March delivery on the Shanghai exchange climbed
1.8 percent to close at 56,860 yuan ($8,998) a ton.  Aluminum was little changed at $2,163 a ton in London and
zinc retreated 1 percent at $1,911 a ton. Nickel dropped 0.2
percent to $19,461 a ton, while lead was up 0.6 percent at
$2,000.50 a ton. Tin declined 0.3 percent to $20,325 a ton.  Norsk Hydro  Norsk Hydro ASA (NYO) ,  Europe ’s third-largest  aluminum  maker,
plans to cut the capacity of its Kurri Kurri smelter in
 Australia ’s New South Wales by a third due to low metal prices.  Norsk Hydro may cease production at one of the smelter’s
three potlines, which together have capacity to produce about
180,000 tons of aluminum annually, Halvor Molland, a spokesman
for the company, said by phone. The operation is currently
running at a loss, he said.  The cut comes after  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the biggest U.S. aluminum
producer, said last week it will close 531,000 tons of capacity,
12 percent of its global supply, after the price of the
lightweight metal slumped amid a global surplus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
