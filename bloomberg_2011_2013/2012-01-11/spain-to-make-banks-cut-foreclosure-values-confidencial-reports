Spain ’s new government will force
banks to cut the values of foreclosed homes by as much as half
as part of its plan to clean up lenders’ balance sheets,  El
Confidencial  reported, citing unidentified people with knowledge
of the matter.  The banks, which will be given two years to make provisions
for the losses, will also be required to cut the values of their
urban land assets by 80 percent and value rural land on their
books at virtually zero, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
