AllianceBernstein (AB)  LP, the investment
unit of French insurer  Axa SA (CS)  that has suffered net redemptions
for the past four years, said its assets fell in December as
investors continued to withdraw money from the firm.  Assets dropped to $406 billion from $411 billion at the end
of November, the New York-based firm said today in a statement.
The company blamed the decline on withdrawals in its
institutional, retail and private-client businesses, according
to the statement.  Investors have pulled more than $200 billion from
AllianceBernsteinâ€™s funds since the beginning of 2008, according
to company reports. During the first three quarters of 2011,
they removed $49.3 billion from the firm.  Last month the company named James A. Gingrich chief
operating officer, replacing David Steyn, as part of a push to
diversify investment services amid client redemptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
