Romania ’s  inflation  rate fell to the
lowest level in two decades in December, meeting the central
bank’s target for the first time in five years, as a bumper
harvest eased food prices.  The rate fell to 3.1 percent from a year earlier from 3.4
percent in November, the Bucharest-based  National Statistics
Institute  said today in an e-mail. The median estimate of eight
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 3.3 percent rate.
Prices rose 0.2 percent on the month.  Romanian policy makers cut the main  interest rate  by a
quarter of a percentage point for the second time in a row this
month to 5.75 percent, as record-slow inflation made room for
lower borrowing costs to boost economic growth in the export-
reliant country.  The inflation rate may fall to less than 2 percent by March
and be at about 3 percent by the end of this year, central bank
Governor Mugur Isarescu said on Nov. 7.  Food-price growth slowed to 0.95 percent in December from a
year earlier, compared with 1.4 percent growth in November, on
lower fruit and vegetable prices, the institute said.  Non-food costs rose 4.45 percent from a year earlier last
month, mainly driven by higher heating bills, compared with 4.9
percent in November, the institute said. Service-price growth
quickened to 4.2 percent from 4 percent in the previous month,
on higher railway and water prices, according to the institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
