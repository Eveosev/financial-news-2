AMR Corp (AAMRQ) ., the owner of  American
Airlines , sought a bankruptcy judge’s approval to hire Perella
Weinberg Partners LP as a financial adviser on labor agreements
and pension plans.  AMR will pay Perella Weinberg $225,000 a month, the company
said in a filing yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Manhattan.  “PWP had been engaged to provide labor-related
restructuring advice, which includes reviewing and analyzing the
strategic alternatives available to the debtors with respect to
its labor agreements, costs and negotiations and its pension and
other post-retirement plans,” lawyers for Fort Worth, Texas-
based AMR said in the filing.  AMR has already enlisted Rothschild Inc. to advise on its
debt restructuring, according to the filing. Once the world’s
largest airline, AMR filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 29 listing
debt of almost $30 billion.  The case is In re AMR Corp., 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
