Germany â€™s transport ministry stopped
the release of a study on noise pollution caused by the Berlin-
Brandenburg airport, which is to open on June 3,  Financial Times
Deutschland  said.  A press conference scheduled for yesterday by the Federal
Environment Agency was canceled, the German newspaper said. The
study sets forth the risk of illness through noise pollution and
calls for a ban on night flights as well as daytime flights over
the district of Wannsee, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
