The U.S. government may trim its
forecast for  Florida’s orange  crop by 0.7 percent to 149 million
boxes, according to the average estimate of six traders and
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  In  December , the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  increased
its projection by 2 percent to 150 million boxes for the 2011-
2012 harvest, which ends in July. The previous crop totaled
140.3 million boxes, each weighing 90 pounds, or 41 kilograms.
The agency will update its forecast tomorrow at 8:30 a.m.
