U.S. natural-gas supplies probably
fell by less than the seasonal average last week as above-normal
temperatures limited demand for heating fuels, according to
analyst estimates compiled by  Bloomberg (DOENUSCH) .  Inventories dropped 90 billion cubic feet, or 2.6 percent,
to 3.382 trillion cubic feet in the week ended Jan. 6, based on
the median of 14 estimates. The five-year average stockpile
change for the week is a decrease of 128 billion, according to
Energy Department data. Supplies fell 137 billion cubic feet a
year earlier.  The weather was warmer than normal across most of the
continental U.S. in the week covered by the report, according to
Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland . Gas
 stockpiles  totaled 3.472 trillion cubic feet as of Dec. 30, 15.2
percent above the five-year average and 11.4 percent above year-
earlier levels, the Energy Department said last week.  “Temperatures cooled last week in the consuming East, but
warmed elsewhere, so we expect a withdrawal similar to the
previous week,” said  Martin King , an analyst at FirstEnergy
Capital Corp. in Calgary. “This modest withdrawal will only
serve to further widen the year-over-year storage surplus.”  The stockpile estimates ranged from decreases of 70 billion
to 103 billion cubic feet. The Energy Department’s weekly supply
report is scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in
 Washington .  The low temperature in Chicago on Jan. 6 was 41 degrees
Fahrenheit (5 Celsius), 22 above normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania. About 51
percent of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, Energy
Department data show.  Natural gas for February delivery rose 7.3 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $3.062 per million British thermal units last week
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices today fell 16.8
cents, or 5.7 percent, to $2.773 per million Btu at 12:32 p.m.
after falling to the lowest intraday price in more than two
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
