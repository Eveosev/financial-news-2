Greece , backed by the European Union
and  International Monetary Fund , and a negotiating committee for
the countryâ€™s lenders have agreed on the coupon and maturity of
new bonds to be issued as part of a debt swap,  Euro2day  said,
without saying where it got the information.  Lenders who participate in the debt swap will have a choice

year bonds with a 5 percent interest rate, the Athens-based news
