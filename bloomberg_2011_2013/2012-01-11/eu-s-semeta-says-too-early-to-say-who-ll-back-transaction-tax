European Taxation Commissioner
Algirdas Semeta said it’s too early to tell how proposals for a
financial-transaction tax will take shape or which countries
will participate.  Semeta said he’s “quite optimistic” that “good
progress” on the proposal will be made over the next six
months, while  Denmark  holds the EU’s rotating presidency.
Speaking to reporters in Copenhagen today, he declined to say
whether the U.K., which opposes any tax not imposed on a
worldwide basis, could be convinced to participate or whether
the plan could otherwise proceed.  Denmark has voiced a national position that’s similar to the
British view. An EU-only financial transaction tax would drive
away investment and weaken employment unless a levy was accepted
worldwide, said Margrethe Vestager, Denmark’s economy minister,
in an interview last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
