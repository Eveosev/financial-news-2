ZTE Corp. (000063) ,  China ’s second-largest
maker of phone equipment, said sales of its smartphones will
double this year as it gains market share in Europe,  North
America , Brazil and Japan.  Sales of the handsets that can be used to surf the Web,
watch videos and play games rose fivefold to more than 12
million units last year, Shenzhen-based ZTE said in an e-mailed
statement today.  ZTE said in November the U.S. will be its largest market
for handsets and tablet computers by 2015, overtaking its home
market in China. China accounted for about 35 percent of ZTE’s
handset sales in the first nine months of 2011, while the U.S.
made up about 10 percent, He Shiyou, ZTE executive vice
president, said in November.  ZTE became the fourth-largest handset maker in the world in
the third quarter as shipments rose 58 percent from a year
earlier, research firm IDC said in October. ZTE took 4.9 percent
of the global market, passing Apple Inc.’s 4.3 percent.  ZTE rose as much as 1.6 percent and was 0.4 percent higher
at HK$24.50 as of 11:46 a.m. in trading on the Hong Kong stock
exchange. The  shares  have dropped 4.7 percent in the past 12
months, less than the 20 percent decline in the benchmark  Hang
Seng Index  in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
