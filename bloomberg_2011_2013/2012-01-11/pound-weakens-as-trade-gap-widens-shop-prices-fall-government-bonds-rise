The pound fell to a three-month low
versus the dollar after a government report showed the trade
deficit widened more than economists forecast, fueling bets the
central bank will need to add more stimulus to spur growth.  Sterling declined versus all 16 of its major counterparts
and gilts advanced after the  British Retail Consortium  said
shop-price inflation slowed to a 16-month low in December. The
 Bank of England  will keep its bond-purchase target unchanged at
275 billion pounds ($421 billion) at a policy meeting tomorrow,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “The trade data is worse than expected, and it has
negative connotation on sterling,” said Jane Foley, a senior
currency strategist at Rabobank International in London. “There
is also some outside talk about possibility that the Bank of
England may expand the target for bond purchases. The consensus
view is that it remains unchanged.”  The pound declined 1 percent to $1.5324 at 5:17 p.m. London
time after falling to $1.5309, the weakest level since Oct. 6.
Sterling dropped 0.9 percent to 117.91 yen, and slid 0.3 percent
to 82.77 pence per euro.  The trade deficit widened to 8.64 billion pounds in
November from a revised 7.87 billion pounds in October, the
 Office for National Statistics  said in London. Exports fell 1.5
percent on the month, while imports rose 1.1 percent. Retail-
price inflation slowed to 1.7 percent last month from a year
earlier, versus 2 percent in November, the British Retail
Consortium and Nielsen Co. said.  Gilts Gain  The yield on the 10-year  gilt  fell seven basis points to
2.01 percent. The 3.75 percent bond due in September 2021 rose
0.68, or 6.80 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 115.24.
Two-year yields dropped four basis points to 0.39 percent.  Gilts stayed higher after the U.K. sold 3 billion pounds of
10-year bonds, with the auction attracting bids for more than
twice the amount of debt allotted. The bonds were sold at an
average yield of 2.085 percent, compared with 2.382 percent at
the previous auction last month.  The implied yield on short-sterling interest-rate futures
maturing in March fell three basis points to 1.07 percent,
signaling investors are increasing bets that the central bank
will further loosen monetary policy.  U.K.  government bonds  have handed investors a loss of 0.6
percent this year, compared with a decline of 0.3 percent from
German bunds and 0.4 percent from  U.S. Treasuries , according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Gilts outperformed all 26
government bonds tracked by Bloomberg last year.  The pound has fallen 0.9 percent this year and 2.8 percent
in the past 12 months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes, which track 10 developed-nation currencies.  Sterling will strengthen to $1.56 by year-end, according to
a Bloomberg survey of analysts with the most recent forecasts
given the heaviest weighting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
