Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO) ’s 60
percent share of the Paris grocery market “constitutes a
barrier to competition” that the French antitrust regulator
said will be “difficult to reverse.”  The Autorite de la Concurrence said it doesn’t have the
power to do anything other than advise the city of Paris
encourage more competition. Paris complained to the regulator in
2011, claiming the French supermarket operator’s brands exert
excessive influence on the capital region’s retail food sales.  Casino’s French chains and brands include Franprix, Leader
Price, Monoprix, Geant and Cdiscount, along with its namesake
stores. The Saint Etienne-based company was founded in 1898 and
gets over half its pre-tax income in  France , where sales rose
5.9 percent in the first half of 2011.  The Parisian market is open to competition and doesn’t have
barriers to entry, Casino said in a statement. It said its
market share in the capital won’t exceed 38.5 percent.  The regulator recommended ending the approval process for
stores bigger than 1,000 square meters (10,763 square feet) and
that the city designate “sufficiently large spaces” to allow
large supermarkets, according to a statement by the authority on
its decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
