Philippine 20-year bonds rose,
pushing yields to the lowest level since July, on speculation
the central bank will cut borrowing costs as  Europe ’s debt
crisis threatens economic growth. The peso was little changed.  European Central Bank Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said yesterday that he sees the risk of a “mild
recession” in the euro area. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas may
ease monetary policy this quarter as inflation cools, Governor
Amando Tetangco said yesterday. The central bank will review its
4.5 percent benchmark rate on Jan. 19. Philippine  exports  fell
19.4 percent in November from a year earlier, official data
showed yesterday.  “More people are anticipating the central bank will cut
rates and that’s prompting funds to add to their holdings of
 government bonds ,” said Antonio Espedido, treasurer at China
Banking Corp. in  Manila . “The peso is getting its cue from
regional currency movements. Europe’s crisis is making it
difficult for it to recover and appreciate.”  The yield on the government’s 8 percent bonds due July 2031
fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.99
percent as of 4:00 p.m. in Manila, according to Tradition
Financial Services. That’s the lowest level since the bonds were
issued in July. The peso was little changed at 43.99 per dollar
from 43.98 yesterday, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  The government likely had a budget deficit of 140 billion
pesos ($3.18 billion) to 170 billion pesos in 2011, Budget
Undersecretary Laura Pascua told reporters today in Manila,
compared with an October forecast of 260.6 billion pesos. The
shortfall was 22 billion pesos in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
