Ford Motor Co. (F)  is recalling about
490,000 vehicles to fix defects that can cause fires or loss of
power.  The action covers 205,896 Ford Freestar and Mercury
Monterey minivans and 244,530 Ford Escape sport-utility vehicles
in the U.S. and about 40,000 Escapes outside the U.S., according
to statements on the  National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration  website and from Dan Pierce, a Ford spokesman.  “Ford is committed to top quality and responding quickly
for our customers concerning any safety issues,” Pierce said.  The Escape recall follows another in 2007 during which
Ford, based in Dearborn,  Michigan , said some of the vehicles may
not have been properly repaired. The minivan recalls followed an
investigation by the U.S. auto-safety regulator.  The 2001 and 2002 model Escape SUVs may have brake-fluid
leaks from the caps of their brake master cylinder reservoirs,
leading to corrosion that may cause fire, according to the
company.  “Ford has received a few reports of property damage beyond
vehicle-only damage as a result of alleged vehicle fires,”
Pierce said of the Escape recall. The company isn’t aware of any
accidents or injuries caused by the leaks, he said.  Ford is recalling 2004 and 2005 model Freestar and Monterey
minivans because the torque converter output shafts in their
power trains may fail and cause sudden loss of power.  Two “minor” accidents are have alleged to have resulted
over eight years, with “minor” injuries in one and no injuries
in the other, Pierce said of the Freestar and Monterey recall.  Ford rose 2.3 percent to $12.07 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
