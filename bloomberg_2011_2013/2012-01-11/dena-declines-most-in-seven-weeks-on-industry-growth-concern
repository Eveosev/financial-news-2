DeNA Co. (2432) ,  Japan ’s biggest social-
network game operator, fell the most in seven weeks in Tokyo
trading on concern earnings growth in the industry may slow.  DeNA  slumped  6.3 percent to 1,899 yen at the close of
trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest decline since
Nov. 21.  Gree Inc. (3632) , the country’s second-largest social-network
game operator, lost 4.9 percent to 2,282 yen.  Gree may report full-year operating profit of 70 billion
yen ($910 million), the Nikkei newspaper reported Jan. 6. That
would miss analysts’ expectations of 74.9 billion yen, according
to the average forecast of 21  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “The sentiment in the sector worsened after the Nikkei
reported about Gree earnings,” Yusuke Tsunoda, an analyst at
 Tokai Tokyo Securities Co. (8616)  said by phone. “DeNA and Gree have
the same earnings trend.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
