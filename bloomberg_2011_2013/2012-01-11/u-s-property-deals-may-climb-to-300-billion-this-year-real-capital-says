U.S. commercial property deals are
likely to climb 50 percent to $300 billion this year as loan
maturities force asset sales and the economy grows,  Real Capital
Analytics Inc.  said in its annual list of market predictions.  “Commercial real estate remains very attractive relative
to other asset classes, and it is likely that equity capital
will be both more plentiful and more motivated over the coming
year,” the New York-based real estate research company said in
today’s report. While a 50 percent increase is likely, there is
a “good chance for a surprise to the upside,” the firm said.  Property owners and lenders have at least $160 billion of
troubled commercial mortgages to resolve by reworking debt or
selling the real estate backing them, according to Real Capital.
With attractive financing difficult to come by, loan maturities
will drive transactions, the firm said.  “While prices and loan terms have not improved enough to
make refinancing feasible in most cases, properties can
increasingly be sold at prices above their outstanding loan
balance and are being listed for sale six to twelve months prior
to maturity date,” Real Capital said.  As rents and occupancies start to rise consistently,
investors will face increasing pressure to make acquisitions
before expansion peaks and price gains accelerate, according to
the firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
