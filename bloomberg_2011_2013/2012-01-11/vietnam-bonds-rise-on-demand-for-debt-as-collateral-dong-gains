Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained on
speculation commercial banks purchased the securities for
collateral to get central bank loans. The dong rose.  “Demand for bonds on the secondary market has increased as
banks need to buy the notes to use as collateral to borrow money
to ensure liquidity,” said Ho Chi Minh City-based Cao Tan Phat,
an analyst at ACB Securities Inc.  Lenders need more cash as depositors usually withdraw funds
ahead of the Lunar New Year, or Tet, Phat said. Vietnam will
celebrate the Tet festival from Jan. 23 to Jan. 27.  Yields (GGVN5YR)  on five-year debt fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 12.47 percent as of 3:02 p.m. in Hanoi,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong gained 0.1 percent to 21,013 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the
 reference rate  at 20,828, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
official rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
