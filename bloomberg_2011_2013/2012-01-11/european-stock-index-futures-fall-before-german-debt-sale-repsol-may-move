European stocks  fell from a one-week
high as  Fitch Ratings  said the  European Central Bank  must do
more to prevent debt crisis from spreading and a report
indicated the German economy is shrinking.  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , Spain’s largest oil company, tumbled 5.7
percent after selling 61 million of its own shares. Pirelli & C.
SpA, Europe’s third-largest tiremaker, lost 4.5 percent after
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. said global tire demand is weak.  Chr.
Hansen Holding A/S (CHR)  jumped 9.8 percent as Novo A/S agreed to buy
a 26 percent stake in the Danish food-ingredient company.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  dropped 0.4 percent to 249.93 at
the close of trading, after earlier climbing as much as 0.3
percent. The gauge has still advanced 2.2 percent this year as
economic reports around the world added to optimism the global
economy can withstand the euro area’s debt crisis.  “There is nothing different between the crisis at the end
of 2011 and at the beginning of 2012,” said Lorne Baring,
managing director at B Capital SA in Geneva, which oversees
almost $500 million. “The rally in markets was a search for
optimism away from  Europe , but at some point it was going to
come back onto the table.”  National benchmark indexes declined in 13 of the 18 western
European markets today.  Germany ’s DAX and  France ’s CAC 40 lost
0.2 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 slipped 0.5 percent.  ECB Bond Purchases  The ECB should step up its government bond purchases to
combat the debt crisis,  David Riley , head of Fitch’s sovereign-
debt unit, said at an event in  Frankfurt  today.  “We need to have a credible buyer put in place and we
don’t have that at the moment,” Riley said. “The ECB needs to
be more actively engaged, but it can’t save the euro on its own.
The crisis won’t be over until we have a broad-based economic
recovery.”  Germany may be on the brink of recession after the debt
crisis caused the economy to contract in the final quarter of
2011. Europe’s largest economy shrank “roughly” 0.25 percent
in the fourth quarter from the prior period, the Federal
Statistics Office said today.  Germany received bids for 8.97 billion euros ($11 billion)
of five-year notes at an auction today, more than double the
maximum target.  Spain  and  Italy  are due to sell as much as 17
billion euros in debt tomorrow.  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said his nation deserves
recognition for the austerity measures it has adopted and should
not be “feared” as a source of contagion in the region’s debt
crisis. Italians have supported “very tough” measures by his
government, Monti said at a press conference with German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  in Berlin today.  Repsol Retreats  Repsol dropped 5.7 percent to 22.20 euros in  Madrid , the
largest decline in four months, after the company sold 5 percent
of its shares to investors.  A gauge of oil and gas companies sank the most of all 19
 industry groups  in the Stoxx 600 as crude fell. The gauge
declined 1.8 percent, the most in four weeks.  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA)  retreated 3.1 percent to 2,327.5 pence, while  BG Group Plc (BG/) 
slipped 2 percent to 1,448 pence.  Statoil ASA (STL)  lost 1.7 percent
to 152.40 kroner and  SBM Offshore NV (SBMO) , the world’s biggest
supplier of floating oil and gas output platforms, dropped 5.6
percent to 14.87 euros.  Pirelli slid 4.5 percent to 6.63 euros after Goodyear, the
largest U.S. tiremaker, said it’s experiencing weakness in
global demand.  “The volume environment globally is a little bit
challenging as we finish 2011 and get started on 2012,”
Goodyear Chief Executive Officer Darren Wells said late
yesterday.  Metro Downgrade  Metro AG (MEO) ,  Germany’s largest retailer , declined 3.3 percent
to 28.36 euros after Benjamin Peters, an analyst at UBS AG, cut
the stock to “sell” from “neutral.” The shares “will come
under increasing pressure from earnings downgrades,” Peters
wrote in a report.  Nestle SA, the world’s biggest food company, fell 1.7
percent to 53.85 Swiss francs after Bank of America Corp.
downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy.”  Aryzta AG (ARYN) , a Swiss supplier of bakery products to
supermarkets and restaurants, tumbled 6.8 percent to 42.8 francs
after it sold 4.25 million new shares at 41 francs each. That
was the largest drop since April 2009 and the  worst performance 
in the Stoxx 600 today.  Chr. Hansen Rises  Chr. Hansen jumped 9.8 percent to 135.10 kroner, the
biggest jump since the company first sold stock in June 2010, as
Novo agreed to buy 35.4 million shares at 117 kroner apiece.
Chr. Hansen also reported first-quarter net income that matched
analyst estimates.  Alcatel-Lucent climbed 6.9 percent to 1.36 euros after Kai Korschelt, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, raised the stock to
“buy” from “hold.”  Italian banks advanced today, with  Banca Popolare di Milano
Scarl (PMI)  jumping 9.4 percent to 29.4 euro cents.  Banca Monte dei
Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS)  increased 8.1 percent to 21.3 euro cents.
 UniCredit SpA (UCG)  gained 5.5 percent to 2.56 euros as the shares
were raised to “outperform” from “underperform” by Sanford
C. Bernstein & Co. analysts, who cited the stock’s “now
attractive” valuation. The bank was also upgraded to
“neutral” from “reduce” by WestLB AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
