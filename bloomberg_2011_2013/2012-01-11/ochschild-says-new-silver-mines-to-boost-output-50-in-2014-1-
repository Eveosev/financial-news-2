Hochschild Mining Plc (HOC) , a producer of
silver in Peru and  Argentina , plans to increase output of the
metal by about 50 percent in 2014 by constructing two mines.  Hochschild decided to build the mines that will add about
10 million silver equivalent ounces a year after successful
feasibility studies, the company said in a statement today.
Hochschild targeted output of 22.5 million silver ounces in
2011. Its stock rose to a one-month high in London trading.  The Inmaculada project, due to start output in the third
quarter of 2013 and 60 percent owned by Hochschild, will cost
$315 million to construct and produce about 12 million silver
equivalent ounces annually. The Crespo mine will add 2.7 million
silver ounces starting 2014, the London-based company said.  Silver producers are seeking to expand output to benefit
from prices that have almost tripled in the past three years.
Fresnillo, the worldâ€™s largest miner of the metal, plans to
boost production by about 60 percent to 65 million ounces by
2018.  Hochschild rose 2.7 percent to 431.8 pence by the close in
 London , the highest since Dec. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
