Russia ’s exports of grain, beans and
peas were 17.9 million metric tons from the start of the
marketing season on July 1 to the end of 2011, the Institute for
Agricultural Market Studies said.  Grain shipments exceeded 17.5 million tons, including 14.5
million tons of wheat, more than 2 million tons of barley and
700,000 tons of corn. Exports of legumes exceeded 390,000 tons,
the institute, known as Ikar, said on its  website .  Exports will be “significantly less” in the second half
of the season that ends on June 30 and will probably total no
more than 24.5 million tons in the whole period, Ikar said.
Russian farmers harvested an estimated 94 million tons of grain
in the 2011-12 season, Ikar said, without specifying whether the
figure related to the crop before or after drying and cleaning.
Last season, the harvest was 60.9 million tons after drying and
cleaning, according to government statistics.  Russia’s grain crop reached 93.9 million tons after drying
and cleaning, up from 60.96 million tons, Moscow-based
researcher SovEcon said on its website yesterday, citing
preliminary state statistics.  Russia’s rice harvest was 1.05 million tons, of which it
may export up to 160,000 tons, according to Ikar. The crop of
buckwheat gained to 800,000 tons, covering domestic consumption
of about 700,000 tons, the researcher said.  The oilseeds crop will exceed 12 million tons for the first
time, including 9.6 million tons of sunflower seeds, almost 1.7
million tons of soya beans, 1.05 million tons of rapeseeds and
more than 350,000 tons of flax seeds, Ikar said. That will allow
Russia to export about 350,000 tons of sunflower seeds and
produce 1.2 million tons of sunflower oil, the institute said.  Russia’s exports of sunflower oil exceeded 325,000 tons
from the start of the oilseed industry’s season to the end of
December, an “absolute record,” the institute said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
