Hong Kong  will measure pollutants
smaller than 2.5 micrometers at all its monitoring stations by
March, as roadside smog reached a record last year.  The government is testing sampler monitors at nine stations,
adding to the five that are already measuring the fine particle
pollutants, Environment Secretary Edward Yau said in a written
reply to the Legislative Council today. Yau didn’t say if the
data would be released to the public.  PM2.5 particles are more dangerous than larger particles
because they may interfere with gas exchange inside the lungs
when inhaled,  according to  the  World Health Organization .
Roadside pollution in Hong Kong was the worst ever last year,
the  South China Morning Post  reported on Jan. 9, citing data
from the government’s environmental protection department.  The Hong Kong government is working on a final proposal to
update its air quality objectives, which it plans to submit to
the Legislative Council for discussion “as soon as possible,’
Yau said.  Beijing will publish its PM2.5 data before the Lunar New
Year Holiday starts on Jan. 23, Xinhua reported on Jan. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
