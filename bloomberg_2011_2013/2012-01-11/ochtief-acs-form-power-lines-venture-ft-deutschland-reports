Hochtief AG (HOT)  will form a venture with
its owner Actividades de Construccion & Servicios SA to build
power lines, a move that will allow it to benefit from the
change in energy policy in Germany,  Financial Times Deutschland
said , citing a Hochtief spokesman it didn’t name.  The joint venture, with  ACS (ACS) ’s unit Cobra, has been filed
with antitrust authorities, the German newspaper said. The
change in energy policy means that “billions” must be invested
in power lines, partly to transmit energy generated by wind
power from the north of the country to the south, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
