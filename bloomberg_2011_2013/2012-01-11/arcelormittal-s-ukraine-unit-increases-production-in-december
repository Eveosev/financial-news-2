ArcelorMittal (MT) ’s Ukrainian unit said
steel production rose in December from the same month a year
earlier, the first time there’s been a year-on-year increase
since August, as the mill finished equipment upgrades.  Production jumped by 13.9 percent, to 547,600 metric tons,
from 480,600 tons in December 2010, ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih,
based in the Ukrainian city of that name, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  In 2011 as a whole, the unit’s output declined to 5.7
million tons, from 6.1 million the previous year, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
