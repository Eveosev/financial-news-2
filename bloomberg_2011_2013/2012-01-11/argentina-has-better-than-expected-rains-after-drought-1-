Argentine farmers received “better
than expected” rainfall in the past 24 hours to limit damage to
corn and soybean crops caused by dry weather, the Rosario
Cereals Exchange said in an e-mailed report today.  The precipitation, which measured up to 90 millimeters
(3.54 inches) in some areas, remain insufficient to alleviate
dry conditions that have harmed crops, the exchange said.  “These rains bring relief,” exchange agronomist Cristian Russo said by telephone today. “But they are not enough for
farmers to restart planting.”  Corn and soybean futures fell today on the Chicago Board of
Trade on speculation cooler weather and rains for  Argentina  and
 Brazil  may benefit crops damaged by dry conditions. Argentina is
the world’s second-largest corn exporter behind the U.S. and the
third-largest shipper of soybeans.  Only 40 percent of the Pampas received rains measuring more
than 40 millimeters, the exchange said in the report. Farmers
need between 100 millimeters and 150 millimeters to curb the
damage to crops, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
