Uruguay’s  industrial  production fell
8.7 percent in November from a year earlier as a state-owned
refinery remained closed for maintenance, the national
statistics institute said in a report on its website.  Excluding the refinery, industrial production rose 4.5
percent, according to the report.  In October, industrial production fell 14 percent from a
year earlier because of the closure at state-run energy company
Ancap’s La Teja refinery, the only one in the South American
country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
