DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private coal
and power producer, won a bid for power distributor PAT
 Donetskoblenergo (DOON) ’s 40 percent stake, its third purchase of power
companies in one week.  Ukraine’s state property fund sold the stake in
Donetskoblenergo to DTEK for 467.6 million hryvnia ($58
million), according to a statement on the fund’s website today.
DTEK, owned by the country’s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov,was the
only bidder for 25 percent of power producer  PAT Dniproenergo (DNEN)  in
another auction today, the property fund said.  The fund will complete the sale of Dniproenergo to DTEK
after a so-called independent estimate of the price for
Dniproenergo, the property fund said. DTEK offered 1.174 billion
hryvnia for the stake. Donetsk-based DTEK already holds 47.55
percent in Dniproenergo.  DTEK also paid 1.931 billion hryvnia to the country’s state
budget today for 45.1 percent in another power producer, PAT
 Zakhidenergo (ZAEN) , the company said today by e-mail.  The state property fund confirmed the sale of the
Zakhidenergo stake to DTEK yesterday after an independent
estimation of the price. DTEK was the only bidder for
Zakhidenergo at an auction in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
