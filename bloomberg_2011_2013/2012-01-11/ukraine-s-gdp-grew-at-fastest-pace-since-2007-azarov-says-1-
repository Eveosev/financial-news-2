Ukraine’s  gross domestic product 
expanded at the fastest pace since 2007, spurred by a good
harvest and increased exports, Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov 
said.  The economy grew “almost” 5 percent, Azarov told a weekly
Cabinet meeting today in the capital, Kiev. That compares with a
4.2 percent rise in 2010 and a 3.9 percent forecast by the
government for 2012. The European Union’s debt crisis is a
“risk” for Ukraine’s economy this year, he said.  Ukraine’s state debt declined to 27.4 percent of GDP last
year, compared with about 30 percent in 2010, Azarov said. The
government cut the  budget deficit  to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2011,
he said without giving any details.  The former Soviet republic’s economy has picked up after an
almost 15 percent decline in 2009 as foreign demand for its
steel and chemicals waned. The grain harvest probably increased 
by about 50 percent in 2011 because of favorable weather.  Ukraine, which relies on  Russia  for more than 70 percent of
its natural gas needs, is seeking to negotiate a discounted
price to help its public finances. The 2012 budget assumes an
average price of $416 per 1,000 cubic meters for the fuel from
Russia.  “This year will be decisive for solving the gas issue,”
Azarov said, adding that Ukraine will cut gas consumption and
should use more electricity.  Ukraine also wants to reduce gas imports to 27 billion
cubic meters of gas in 2012, compared with 45 billion cubic
meters in the previous year.  -- With assistance from Kateryna Choursina in Kiev. Editors:
