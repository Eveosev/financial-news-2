Spanish banks may be unable to
generate more than 30 billion euros ($38 billion) of the
estimated 50 billion euros of extra provisions needed to clean
up the banking system,  Expansion  reported, citing unidentified
people in the financial industry.  While the biggest banks would be able to repair their
balance sheets without help, 20 billion euros of taxpayersâ€™
money might be needed to help smaller ones, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
