Illinois’s (STOIL1)  cost to borrow relative
to top-rated issuers tripled from 2009 when it sold $800 million
of bonds today, after its  credit rating  was cut by Moody’s
Investors Service to the lowest among U.S. states.  The $525 million tax-exempt part of today’s sale included
10-year general-obligation bonds priced to yield 3.1 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s 110 basis points
more than the  2 percent yield  of top-rated 10-year debt.  A 10-year bond sold on Sept. 16, 2009, the last time
Illinois took competitive bids for tax-exempt general
obligations, was priced at 37 basis points above  top-rated debt. 
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Moody’s cited “chronic” late bill payments and unfunded
retirement obligations when it cut $32 billion of  Illinois 
general-obligation debt one level on Jan. 6 to A2, the sixth-
highest rating and the lowest among U.S. states. The pension has
assets to cover only 45 percent of projected liabilities, the
least of any state, according to a study by Bloomberg Rankings.  The sale benefited from the lowest yields on AAA rated
general obligations since at least 1991, Bloomberg  data  show.  Absolute rates on the tax-exempt sale for capital projects
were the lowest for Illinois since at least 1976, according to
 Kelly Kraft , a spokeswoman for Governor Pat Quinn’s budget
office.  “These bond bids make clear that investors know we are
taking steps to correct the decades of fiscal mismanagement in
our state,” David Vaught, director of the state Office of
Management and Budget, said in a statement.  The debt will pay for projects including schools and
transportation in the fifth-most-populous U.S. state.  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  beat seven other bidders for the $525
million of tax-exempt bonds.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  outbid eight
banks for the $275 million of taxable bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
