Investors may be about to turn
toward government bonds and away from stocks and other riskier
assets, according to  Bob Janjuah , global head of tactical asset
allocation at Nomura International Plc.  This shift may begin by the end of the week, Janjuah wrote
yesterday in a report. Yields on 10-year U.S., U.K. and German
notes will be closer to 1.5 percent than 2 percent during the
first quarter, he predicted.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks yields on these securities
since the start of last year, and illustrates his prediction.
Yields on the 10-year Treasury note and its German counterpart
fell below 1.75 percent, the middle of his range, in September.
The U.K. note’s yield set a low of 1.955 percent last month.  The first quarter “is going to be extremely bearish for
risk,” according to Janjuah, based in  London . He cited the
possibility that Greece may default on its debt before the
quarter ends, along with other concerns.  Janjuah, who predicted last year’s second-half retreat in
U.S. stocks, estimated that the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
fall to 1,000 or lower this quarter. That would be a decline of
at least 20 percent from last year’s close.  Appetite for risk may return next quarter, he wrote, as the
 Federal Reserve  and the Bank of England buy bonds in a so-called
quantitative easing and the  European Central Bank  possibly does
the same. After that, he expects a second-half slump that sends
the S&P 500 tumbling to 800.  To contact the reporter on this story:
