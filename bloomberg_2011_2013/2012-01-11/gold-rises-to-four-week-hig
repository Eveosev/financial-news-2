Gold futures rose to a four-week
high as  China ’s physical demand surged to a record and Europe’s
debt woes spurred demand for a haven.  Mainland China bought 102,779 kilograms, an all-time high,
from  Hong Kong  in November, up from 86,299 kilograms in October,
according to the Hong Kong government. Fitch Ratings said
yesterday that Italy faces a “significant chance” of a credit
downgrade. The  European Central Bank  should boost bond purchases
to stem the debt crisis, Fitch said. Gold prices declined 10
percent last month.  “The dip in prices could not have come at a better time
for the Chinese buyers,”  James Cordier , the founder of
Optionsellers.com in Tampa, Florida, said in a telephone
interview. “Gold is regaining its safe-haven qualities.”  Gold futures for February delivery advanced 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,639.60 an ounce at 1:55 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Earlier, the metal reached $1,648, the highest for a most-
active contract since Dec. 13.  China’s imports “are extremely bullish,” Bernard Sin, the
head of currency and metal trading at bullion refiner MKS
Finance SA in Geneva, said in a telephone interview. “We see a
lot of investors rebuilding their gold portfolios again. People
are still very concerned about Europe.”  Gold rose 10 percent in 2011, the 11th straight annual
gain, as investors sought to diversify away from equities and
some currencies.  Silver futures for March delivery gained 0.3 percent to
$29.89 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum rose to a four-week high, and palladium climbed
for the third day in a row.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery rose 2.3 percent to $1,497.70 an ounce. Earlier,
the metal reached $1,501.50, the highest since Dec. 13.  Palladium futures for March delivery advanced 1.6 percent
to $645.65 an ounce. The price gained 3.5 percent in the
previous two days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
