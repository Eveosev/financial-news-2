Australia ’s dollar fell for the
first time in three days versus its U.S. counterpart as Spain
and Italy prepared to auction debt this week amid concern their
credit ratings may be cut as Europe’s debt crisis worsens.  The Aussie also declined versus the yen after Fitch Ratings
said Italy faces a “significant chance” of a downgrade,
sapping demand for riskier assets.  New Zealand ’s dollar,
nicknamed the kiwi, fell as much as 0.2 percent against the
greenback as stocks declined amid speculation France’s credit
rating may be lowered.  “Australia and New Zealand are not immune to what’s
happening in the euro zone,” said Lee Wai Tuck, a strategist at
Forecast Pte in  Singapore . “They’re likely to come under
pressure” against the U.S. dollar, he said.  Australia’s dollar declined as much as 0.5 percent to
$1.0263 before trading at $1.0298 at 12:48 p.m. in  New York ,
down 0.2 percent. The Aussie was little changed at 79.21 yen.  New Zealand’s currency was little changed at 79.47 U.S.
cents after earlier dropping to 79.25 cents. It appreciated to
79.66 yesterday, the highest level since Nov. 9. The kiwi rose
0.1 percent to 61.13 yen.  Spain will sell bonds due in 2015 and 2016 tomorrow. Italy
will auction bills on Jan. 12 and debt due in 2014 and 2018 on
Jan. 13.  Ratings Reviews  Standard & Poor’s  placed the ratings of 15 euro nations,
including AAA rated Germany and France, on review for possible
downgrades on Dec. 5, saying it may cut the French grade by as
many as two steps. Moody’s Investors Service said Dec. 12 it
will review the ratings of European Union countries after a
summit on Dec. 9 in Brussels failed to produce “decisive policy
measures” to end the region’s debt turmoil.  French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  denied having been
notified by a ratings company about a downgrade of France’s top
rating.  The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of stocks fell 0.4 percent.  Fitch said yesterday Italy faces a “significant chance”
of a downgrade. The company is reviewing nations including Italy
and Spain and will make a decision by the end of the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
