Chinese  stocks  listed in  Hong Kong 
may rise about 17 percent by the end of the year as  China ’s
government relaxes monetary policies, according to  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)   The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of so-called H shares
may reach 12,200 by Dec. 31, compared with yesterday’s close of
10,413.61, Helen Zhu, a Goldman Sachs strategist, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview today. The gauge advanced 0.8
percent to 10,500.34 as of 3:17 p.m. local time. Hong Kong’s
benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  may reach 22,000, Zhu said. The gauge
settled yesterday at 19,004.28.  The H-share index has risen 5.6 percent this year, while
the Shanghai Composite Index advanced 3.5 percent after a
weekend central bank report showed new bank lending and  money
supply  exceeded economist estimates in December.  The data prompted investors to think that “the government
may have moved very preemptively,” Zhu said. China may reduce
the amount banks have to keep in reserve in the first half of
the year and any cut in interest rates would likely happen in
the second half, she said.  The People’s Bank of China cut banks’ reserve-requirement
ratios from a record high for the first time in three years on
Nov. 30. Expectations for more monetary easing escalated after
inflation cooled to the slowest pace in 14 months in November
and industrial output growth weakened. Import growth fell to a
two-year low in December, data yesterday showed.  CLSA Cautious  The Shanghai and H-share indexes tumbled 22 percent last
year after the PBOC raised  interest rates  and reserve
requirement ratios to combat rising prices. Data due tomorrow
may show  inflation  slowed to 4 percent in December, the lowest
level since September 2010, according to the median estimate in
a Bloomberg economist survey.  CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets has turned cautious on China’s
stocks because of “downside risk” to the economy from slumping
property prices. The  CSI 300 Index  may rise to 2,600 in the
first half of this year while earnings growth may slow to 5
percent compared with the consensus estimate of 19 percent,
Manop Sangiambut, CLSA’s head of China A-share research, said in
a report dated yesterday.  The central bank may undertake “reactive” policy
loosening rather than “proactive,” he said. The  CSI 300 index (SHSZ300) ,
the 300 most valuable companies trading in the Shanghai and
Shenzhen exchanges, retreated 0.5 percent today to 2,435.61.  New  bank lending  totaled 640.5 billion yuan ($101 billion)
in December, according to a statement posted on the PBOC’s
website on Jan. 8. The amount exceeded the 575 billion yuan
median estimate of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. M2, a
measure of money supply, rose 13.6 percent, compared with the
12.9 percent median of 18 estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
