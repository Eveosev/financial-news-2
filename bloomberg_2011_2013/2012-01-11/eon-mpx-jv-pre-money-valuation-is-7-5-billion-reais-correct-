(Corrects to say valuation refers to MPX in first
paragraph.)  MPX Energia SA (MPXE3)  is worth about 7.5
billion reais, MPX Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Karrer said
on a conference call. The valuation refers to current values
prior to a capital increase and doesn’t include mine assets in
 Colombia  that will be spun off, Karrer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
