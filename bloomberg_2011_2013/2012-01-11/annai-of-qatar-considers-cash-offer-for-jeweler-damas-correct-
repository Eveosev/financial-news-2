(Corrects date in second paragraph of story first
published Jan. 10.)  Qatar’s  Mannai Corp. (MCCS)  is considering
a cash bid for  Damas International Ltd. (DAMAS) , the Dubai jewelry
retailer that was forced to restructure its board and debt after
unauthorized trading by its founders. Damas shares surged.  Mannai, a retailer of  consumer goods  and automobiles,
secured commitments on 58.79 percent of Damas shares, the Doha-
based company said in a statement today. The Abdullah brothers,
the founders of Damas, and other shareholders agreed “to accept
that offer at a price of $0.45 per Damas share, provided that an
announcement of a firm intention to make the offer is made on or
prior to April 30, 2012,” it said.  Damas was fined as much as 2.57 million dirhams ($699,700)
in 2010 by the Dubai Financial Services Authority and its board
was asked to resign after an inquiry found the Abdullah brothers
withdrew funds without board approval and owed the company 614
million dirhams. The withdrawals triggered a liquidity crunch at
the company and a default on loan repayments, which pushed it to
negotiate debt restructuring.  The company reached an agreement with a bank steering
committee last year, which involved extending the maturities on
about 3 billion dirhams of loans. Damas said Nov. 27  six-month
profit  attributable to shareholders rose to 24.7 million dirhams
from 992,000 dirhams a year earlier.  Mannai said it may make the bid for Damas with one or more
investors, without identifying them. “There can be no guarantee
that any offer will ultimately be made for Damas nor as to the
terms on which any offer might be made,” it said.  The Abdullah brothers appointed a financial adviser to sell
some of their stake in the company for no less than 45 cents a
share, Damas said last week.  Damas  shares  soared 133 percent the past month to 35 cents
today, the highest since October 2009. An offer of 45 cents a
share will value the company at $445 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
