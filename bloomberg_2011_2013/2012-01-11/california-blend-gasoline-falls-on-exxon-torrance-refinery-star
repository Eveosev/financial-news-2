California-blend gasoline in  Los
Angeles  tumbled after  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  said the  Torrance (XOTOCRUD)  oil
refinery in  Southern California  was restoring production
following two power failures Jan. 9.  Carbob in Los Angeles dropped 4 cents to a premium of 4.25
cents a gallon against gasoline futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 5:17 p.m. New York time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery of the fuel fell
4.95 cents to $2.8058 a gallon.  Exxon may flare gases at the 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance
refinery through Jan. 15 as the plant recovers from two
“external power interruptions,” according to a notice from the
Irving, Texas-based company to the  South Coast Air Quality
Management District .  Gasoline inventories  on the West Coast, known as the Padd 5
region, rose 5.4 percent to 30.2 million barrels in the week
ended Jan. 6 from a week earlier, the highest level since
August, the Energy Department said.  Carbob in  San Francisco (MOGSD85P)  dropped 4.75 cents to a discount of
2.25 cents to futures, its lowest level since Aug. 16.  California-blend diesel in  Los Angeles (DIEILCAD)  slipped 0.25 cent to
a premium of 5.5 cents against Nymex heating oil futures. The
same fuel in  San Francisco (DIEISCAD)  was 6 cents over futures, the highest
margin since Nov. 10, for a third straight day.  West Coast stocks of  distillate fuel oil  jumped 11 percent
to 14.9 million barrels last week, the highest level in almost a
year, the Energy Department said.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland (MOGHD87P) ,  Oregon , was
unchanged at a premium of 5.5 cents.  BP Plc (BP/)  is performing work
on a coker at the 234,000-barrel-a-day  Cherry Point (BPFECRUD)  oil refinery
in Washington state, a person with knowledge of the maintenance
said earlier this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
