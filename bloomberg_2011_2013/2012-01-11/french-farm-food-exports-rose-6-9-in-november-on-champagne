The value of  France ’s farm and food
exports, the world’s fifth-biggest, rose 6.9 percent in November
on increased sales of champagne and other wines.  Exports of farm products and food climbed to 5.2 billion
euros ($6.6 billion) from 4.86 billion euros a year earlier, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said in an online  report  today. Shipments
jumped 16 percent to 51.9 billion euros through the first 11
months of last year.  France is the European Union’s largest farm producer and
within the 27-nation bloc trails only the Netherlands and
 Germany  in the value of agricultural exports, World Trade
Organization data show. Farm products and food contributed a
10.7 billion-euro surplus to France’s current account in the 11-
month period.  “The exports of wines and champagne remain the leading
source of growth, in particular those to  China , the U.S. and the
U.K.,” the ministry said. Companies based in France make
champagne under brands from Moet & Chandon to Perrier-Jouet.  France also is the EU’s biggest wheat exporter. The
country’s grain deliveries rose 2.8 percent from a year earlier
to 631 million euros by value in November, while oilseed
shipments surged 64 percent to 92 million euros.  Corn exports rose on demand from Spain, the Netherlands and
 Algeria , while durum-wheat shipments to Algeria gained,
according to the report. Rapeseed deliveries increased on demand
from Germany, while soft-wheat exports fell 15 percent in
November, the ministry said.  The country imported 3.9 billion euros of agricultural
goods and food in the month, compared with 3.83 billion euros in
November 2010, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
