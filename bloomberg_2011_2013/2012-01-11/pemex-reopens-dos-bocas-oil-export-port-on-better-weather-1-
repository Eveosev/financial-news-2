Petroleos Mexicanos , the state-owned
 oil company , reopened a crude-export terminal in the  Gulf of
Mexico  today after weather conditions improved.  The terminal at the port of Dos Bocas reopened in the
afternoon, Mexico’s Merchant Marine said in a weather  bulletin 
on its website.  Pemex, the third-largest supplier of oil to the U.S.,
exported about 1.3 million barrels of crude a day in December.
About 84 percent of Mexican crude exports is sold to the U.S.,
according to statistics from Mexico City-based Pemex. Canada is
the largest supplier of crude to the U.S followed by  Saudi
Arabia .  Dos Bocas is Pemex’s third-largest export terminal behind
Cayo Arcas and Coatzacoalcos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
