Tottenham defeated Everton 2-0 to
pull even with second-place  Manchester United  in English
soccer’s Premier League.  Aaron Lennon  and Benoit Assou-Ekotto scored last night at
White Hart Lane in London for Tottenham, which has lost once in
its past 18 league matches. Spurs and defending champion United
have 45 points, three fewer than leader Manchester City.  “We’re up there,” Tottenham manager  Harry Redknapp  told
Sky Sports. “I keep saying nothing is impossible, you just have
to keep believing.”  Since opening their league campaign with back-to-back
losses to the Manchester clubs, Spurs have climbed the standings
with 14 wins, three draws and one defeat. Tottenham hosts Wolves
next before visiting Manchester City on Jan. 22.  Lennon gave Tottenham the lead in the 35th minute when he
took a cross-field pass from Assou-Ekotto, went past two
defenders and shot past goalkeeper  Tim Howard .  Assou-Ekotto doubled the lead in the 63rd minute when he
took a pass 30 yards from goal and smashed a shot that glanced
off Everton’s Tim Cahill and into the top right corner. It was
the defender’s first goal since the opening game of the 2009-10
season.  “He couldn’t have hit it better,” Redknapp said. “It was
absolutely superb.”  Last night’s match was originally scheduled for the opening
day of the season in August and was postponed by the London
riots. Everton lost its second straight game and remains in 11th
place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
