Michigan Governor  Rick Snyder , a 
Republican, talks with Bloomberg's Chris Christoff about his 
efforts to attract immigrants to the state.  Other Republican governors in Arizona, Alabama and South 
Carolina are embroiled in political tumult over their efforts to
weed out illegal immigrants. Snyder assigned agencies to woo 
educated immigrants to the only state that lost population in 
the 2010 U.S. census. (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 02:18
