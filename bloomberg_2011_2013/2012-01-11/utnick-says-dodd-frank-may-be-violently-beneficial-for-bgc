Howard Lutnick , chairman and chief
executive officer of BGC Partners Inc., said the Dodd-Frank
financial overhaul act may be “violently beneficial” for the
New York-based firm.  “Dodd-Frank will either be beneficial, or violently
beneficial for BGC Partners, I’m just not sure which one,”
Lutnick, who also heads New York-based  Cantor Fitzgerald LP (56582) ,
said today in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Inside
Track.” “But the law, the way it’s written, really, really
works for us, because it opens up markets and makes it bigger
for BGC Partners.”  One  of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act enacted in
2010 requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the
Securities and Exchange Commission to increase transparency in
the over-the-counter  derivatives market , where largely
unregulated trades helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis.  BGC specializes in trading over-the-counter financial
instruments and related derivative products. The firm reported
post-tax distributable earnings of $52.3 million, or 20 cents
per share, in the third quarter, compared with $39.5 million, or
17 cents, in the year-earlier period. The company is named after
B. Gerald Cantor, the co-founder of BGC’s predecessor and of
 Cantor Fitzgerald .  Lutnick said BGC and Cantor Fitzgerald plan to hire about
500 employees this year between the two firms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
