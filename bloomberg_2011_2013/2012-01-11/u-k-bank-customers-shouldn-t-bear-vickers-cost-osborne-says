Costs for proposed firebreaks around
the consumer units of British banks shouldn’t be shouldered by
customers, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  told
lawmakers.  “I don’t accept the only way for the banks to absorb these
costs is to increase the cost of lending,” he said to the House
of Commons Treasury Committee today in  London . “They could
actually reduce -- shock, horror -- their remuneration packages.
That might be another way to absorb those costs.”  John Vickers , chairman of the Independent Commission on
Banking, recommended in September that banks insulate consumer
units from  investment banking  to increase stability in the
financial system. The proposals may cost the industry as much 7
billion pounds ($10.7 billion), the ICB report said, and should
be implemented by the government in 2019.  Banks may be a more attractive investment for shareholders
if they’re better regulated, Osborne said. The so-called
implicit guarantee for U.K. banks “was pretty explicit” as the
prior government had no alternative but to bail out  Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , he said.  “No Chancellor of the Exchequer is going to shut down the
cash machines,” Osborne said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
