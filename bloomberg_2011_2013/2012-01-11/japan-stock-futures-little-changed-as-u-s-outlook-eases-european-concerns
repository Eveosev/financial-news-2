Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian stocks were little changed as the  Federal Reserve 
said the U.S. economy improved last month across most of the
nation, while concern mounted  Europe  is heading toward a
recession.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1
exporter of consumer electronics, rose 0.8 percent from the
closing share price in Tokyo even as the yen traded near an 11-
year high against the euro.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , a Japanese trading
company, slid 0.3 percent after oil fell. BHP Billiton Ltd.,
Australia’s largest miner, rose after metal prices increased for
a fourth day.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 8,445 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 8,430
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at  8,440 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index was
little changed today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slipped 0.6
percent in Wellington.  “A solid  U.S. economy  is outweighing concerns about
Europe’s slowdown,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about
$600 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.
“The yen’s strength against the euro continues to weigh on the
market.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The index rose less than 0.1 percent in  New York 
yesterday after climbing 1.1 percent over the previous two days.  The U.S. economic expansion improved last month across most
of the country, while hiring was limited and housing remained
stagnant, the Fed said in its Beige Book business survey
yesterday.  German GDP  Germany’s gross domestic product shrank “roughly” 0.25
percent in the fourth quarter from the third, the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said yesterday, adding to signs
Europe’s largest economy may be on the brink of recession amid
the region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 2.1 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 2.8 percent advance by the
S&P 500 and a 2.2 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.2 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 12.3 times for the
S&P 500 and 10 times for the Stoxx 600.  Chinese stocks traded in the U.S. fell for the first day in
three on concern slumping property prices and Europe’s debt
crisis may hamper growth in the world’s second-largest economy.
The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index retreated 0.2 percent yesterday
from a one-month high to 100.57 as trading closed in New York.  The yen was at 97.70 per euro today after reaching 97.28 on
Jan. 9, its highest level since December 2000. A stronger yen
hurts Japanese exporters as it erodes the value of their
overseas profits.  Crude oil for February delivery declined $1.37 to settle at
$100.87 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The London Metals
Exchange Index, which tracks prices of six metals including
copper and aluminum, rose 0.3 percent yesterday, its fourth
straight daily gain.  To contact the reporters on this story:
