American Apparel Inc. (APP) , the young-
adult clothing retailer, said an investigation by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission into its accounting practices
ended without enforcement.  The investigation was completed and the SEC doesnâ€™t
recommend any action, the Los Angeles-based company said today
in a regulatory  filing .  The SEC requested documents from the chain in 2010 after
Deloitte & Touche LLP quit as its accounting firm and was
replaced by Marcum LLP. Before ending the relationship, Deloitte
notified the retailer that its 2009 financial statements may not
be reliable.  The retailer, led by Chief Executive Officer Dov Charney,
has improved results in the past few months after posting losses
for most of the past two years as sales fell. Revenue grew 15
percent to $56.3 million in December, following a 4.8 percent
gain last quarter.  American Apparel  rose  16 percent to $1 at the close in  New
York . The shares sank 57 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
