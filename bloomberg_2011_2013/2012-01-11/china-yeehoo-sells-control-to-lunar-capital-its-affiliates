China  Yeehoo Group Ltd., a
Guangzhou-based Chinese baby products retailer, has sold a
controlling stake to  Lunar Capital Management  Ltd. and its
affilates.  Yeehoo’s existing management team will remain a substantial
minority shareholder of the company, while Lunar Capital will
appoint a majority of the board of directors and second members
of its operation team to the company, Yehoo said in a release
today. Financial details of the transaction weren’t disclosed.  Demand in China for baby and infant products has been
bolstered by urbanization and rising disposable incomes. Annual
per-household spending on children’s products in urban Chinese
regions increased from $288 in 2005 to $663 in 2009, and is
expected to reach $1,256 by 2013, the release said, citing
estimates by  Frost & Sullivan .  Established in 1995, Yeehoo designs products targeting
infants up to four years old and distributes to more than 650
stores, the company said. Lunar Capital, a Chinese private
equity fund, has investments in cement, forestry and juice-
producing companies in China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
