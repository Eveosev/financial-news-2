Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) , a South
African retailer controlled by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , climbed to
a record after sales for the 26 weeks to December increased 15
percent to 31.6 billion rand ($3.9 billion).  The shares closed 1.6 percent up at 182.35 rand, the
highest since at least June 2000, gaining for a seventh day.  In October, Massmart said it would repeat a price-cut
promotion at its stores and open 23 new outlets over the next
eight months. Massmart reduced prices for 10 weeks starting in
July, after Wal-Mart’s acquisition of a controlling stake was
approved by South African authorities.  “This is a good pick-up in the sales number, with volumes
being driven with extended price cuts and promotions,” Avior
Research analyst Simone Kruger said by phone from  Cape Town .
“Wal-Mart seems to be active in trying to bring in savings and
Massmart will also be adding new space in the next six months.”  Same-store sales increased by 9.2 percent over the 26-week
period, Johannesburg-based Massmart said in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
