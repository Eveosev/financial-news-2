EFG International AG (EFGN) , the Swiss
private bank controlled by Greek billionaire Spiro Latsis, said
investors yesterday approved swapping about a third of their
fiduciary certificates for new 10-year bonds.  The bonds will be compliant with Basel III regulations and
pay a coupon of 8 percent for the first five years, the Zurich-
based bank said today in a  statement  following an extraordinary
 shareholdersâ€™ meeting  yesterday.  EFG announced the exchange offer to holders of 400 million
euros ($510 million) of fiduciary certificates on Nov. 30. Banks
are switching between different types of equity, debt and hybrid
capital to comply with tougher crisis-prevention rules designed
to help financial firms absorb losses.  EFG rose 1 percent to 6.85 Swiss francs as of 9:12 a.m. in
Zurich trading, valuing the bank at 1 billion francs ($1.05
billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
