Uralvagonzavod, the state-run maker
of battle tanks in central  Russia  since World War II, generated
most of its profit from railcars last year as Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin  plans to invest in developing its businesses.  More than two-thirds of the company’s sales of 90 billion
rubles ($2.8 billion) came from the rail business, according to
preliminary 2011 results posted on the company’s  website . The
margin on operating income exceeded 19 percent, compared with
about 8 percent for the battle tank division, it said.  Putin said in September the government plans to spend 64
billion rubles on capital expenditure to develop Uralvagonzavod,
which is run by Chief Executive Officer Oleg Siyenko, a former
senior manager at the state-operated Gazprom Export.  To contact the reporter on this story:
