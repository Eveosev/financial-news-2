Ethanol futures advanced a fourth
day in  Chicago  on concern a government report tomorrow may show
a reduced corn crop, boosting prices for the feedstock.  Prices gained before the release of the Agriculture
Department’s World Supply and Demand Estimate report tomorrow in
 Washington . The last report projected that ethanol would consume
5 billion bushels of corn.  “It was kind of flat,” said Jim Damask, a manager at
Biofuelsconnect, a Jupiter, Florida-based alternative energy
broker. “Pricing didn’t do much. There’s the big report
tomorrow and people are just flattening positions, taking care
of needs in the short-term in case of a big swing.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 0.4 cent to
$2.267 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have
slipped 0.5 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf sank 3
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.275 a gallon and in  New York  and on
the West Coast the biofuel lost 2.5 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
$2.325, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago fell 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.195
a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
