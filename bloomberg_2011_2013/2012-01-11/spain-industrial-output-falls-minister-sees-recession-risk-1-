Spanish  industrial production  fell
the most in two years in November as Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro warned that the euro area’s fourth-largest economy is on
the edge of a recession.  Output at factories, refineries and mines adjusted for the
number of working days declined 7 percent from a year earlier,
the most since October 2009, after a revised 4.2 percent drop
the previous month, the National Statistics Institute said in an
e-mailed statement from  Madrid  today. Non-seasonally adjusted
output fell 7 percent from a year earlier.  Spain’s economy is close to entering a recession, Montoro
told lawmakers in Madrid as they began examining Prime Minister
Mariano Rajoy’s first package of austerity measures. The plan
was announced on Dec. 30 after the new government learned that
the 2011 budget gap will be a third larger than forecast.  “Spain’s economic woes have intensified again, with the
real gross domestic product expected to contract steadily until
late 2012,”  Raj Badiani , an economist at Global Insight Inc. in
 London , said in a note to investors.  Spain’s economy will shrink 1.2 percent this year due to
worsening credit conditions, fiscal tightening and exporters
facing “strong headwinds,” according to a forecast by  Global
Insight .  To contact the reporter on this story:
