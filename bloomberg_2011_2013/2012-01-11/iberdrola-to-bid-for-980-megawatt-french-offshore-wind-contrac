Iberdrola SA (IBE) , Spain’s biggest power
company, submitted two bids with partners Areva SA and Technip
SA to build wind projects off France, seeking to expand its
10,000 megawatts of global offshore capacity.  The combined installed capacity of the farms at Saint-
Brieuc and Saint-Nazaire in western France may be as much as 980
megawatts, enough to power 1.2 million homes, the Bilbao-based
company said today in a statement. Winning bids will be
announced later this year.  France, which has no offshore wind power yet, proposes to
install 6,000 megawatts, or about 1,200  wind turbines , by 2020
to boost energy output while limiting polluting emissions. Bids
are due today for the first round of five zones with a combined
capacity of 3,000 megawatts, which will require about 10 billion
euros ($12.7 billion) of investment, government data show.  Iberdrola, whose bidding partners also include France’s
Eole-Res SA and Neoen Marine, said  Areva (AREVA)  would build the
turbines and  Technip (TEC)  would conduct engineering studies and
install the machines. The Spanish utility oversees projects with
a total capacity of about 10,000 megawatts off France, Germany,
England and Scotland.  “The submission of these bids for the sites at Saint-
Brieuc and Saint-Nazaire is the first stage of a major
challenge,”  Keith Anderson , chief executive officer of
Iberdrola’s  Scottish Power Renewables  unit, said in the
statement.  Winning bids will be preselected in April, and a final
decision made in 2013 once the companies confirm funding. The
wind farms are scheduled to come into service from 2015 to 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
