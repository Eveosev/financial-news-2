Saudi Arabia â€™s oil output of almost
10 million barrels a day is close to the maximum the kingdom
could pump for a sustained period, Reuters reported without
identifying the sources of its information.  The Middle Eastern state, which invested to raise total
capacity to 12.5 million barrels, might not be able to produce
at this level for long periods and pumping that much oil might
yield heavier crudes that would be harder to sell, Reuters
reported.  Reuters also said in the report that Saudi officials were
confident of producing at the higher rate. The country, which
plans to keep about 1.5 million barrels of daily capacity
unused, could easily pump 1 million to 1.5 million barrels a day
of additional crude beyond current output, the agency cited an
unidentified Saudi source as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
