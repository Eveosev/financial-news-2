The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars declined to the lowest in almost four months,
according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 89 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 9 a.m. in
 London . That’s the lowest cost since Sept. 16, 2011 and compares
with minus 93 basis points yesterday.  The one-year basis swap was 80 basis points less than
Euribor, from 81 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  fell to the lowest in almost seven weeks. The Euribor-OIS
spread, the difference between the borrowing benchmark and
overnight index swaps, fell to 92 basis points from 93
yesterday. That’s the lowest since Nov. 24, 2011.  Overnight deposits  at the  European Central Bank  rose to a
record, as lenders parked 486 billion euros ($621 billion) with
the Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, exceeding the previous high
of 482 billion euros on Jan 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
