World No. 10  Andrea Petkovic 
withdrew from the Australian Open tennis tournament because of a
stress fracture in her lower back, organizers said.  Petkovic, a 24-year-old German, reached the quarterfinals
of the year’s first Grand Slam in 2011 and also advanced to the
last eight at the French and U.S. Opens.  “I’ve been having some back problems for the last three or
four months,” Petkovic said in comments distributed by the WTA
Tour. “I’ve been struggling with it, but I’ve always believed
it was going to be fine and so I pushed through the pain. The
doctors have said it will likely take me 6-8 weeks to recover.”  She’s the second woman to withdraw from the season-opening
major in as many days afterVenus Williams yesterday pulled out
citing health issues. The Australian Open starts Jan. 16.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
