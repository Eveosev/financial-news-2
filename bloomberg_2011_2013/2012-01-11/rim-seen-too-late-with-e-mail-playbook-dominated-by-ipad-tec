Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  may need
more than the souped-up software unveiled yesterday in  Las Vegas 
to turn its BlackBerry PlayBook tablet into a challenger to
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad.  At the Cosmopolitan hotel last night, RIM executives showed
off devices with the new PlayBook OS 2.0 software, which
includes built-in e-mail and calendar programs missing from the
original version of the device. A nine-month delay in getting e-
mail onto the PlayBook hurt the tablet’s chances of mainstream
success, said  Jennifer Fritzsche , an analyst at  Wells Fargo &
Co.  in  Chicago .  “It’s too little, too late,” said Fritzsche. “I would
call this a working version of what should’ve come last year --
things that should’ve been there out of the box.”  The fate of the PlayBook, RIM’s initial foray beyond
smartphones, is critical because it’s the first device to be
built using new software on which the company is betting its
future. After postponing the introduction of PlayBook OS 2.0 to
February, RIM said in December that the first BlackBerrys based
on the new operating system, called BB10, won’t be available
until the “latter part” of this year.  Fritzsche says the PlayBook’s appeal is now largely limited
to corporate BlackBerry customers who were willing to wait for
the software upgrade. She rates RIM “market perform” and
expects the company to ship 100,000 PlayBook devices this fiscal
quarter. RIM shipped 150,000 last quarter, while Apple sold 11.1
million iPads in its most recently reported period, outpacing
the PlayBook 74 to 1.  Nuclear Plants  Fritzsche is less optimistic than some other analysts, who
on average project RIM will ship 177,000 PlayBooks this quarter
and 186,000 in the three months ending in May, according to a
survey compiled by Bloomberg. The company shipped 200,000 in the
period that ended in August.  BB10 is based on QNX, sophisticated software also used to
run nuclear  power plants  and unmanned aerial drones. RIM
acquired the software when it bought Ottawa-based QNX Software
Systems in 2010. Difficulties in melding QNX to the PlayBook and
marketing missteps have left PlayBook shipments at a little more
than 1 percent of those for the market-leading iPad.  “The most frustrating thing about the last 12 months is
that PlayBook itself has had so much potential,” RIM Vice
President Alec Saunders said in an interview at the event.
“We’re finally starting to see that potential in the PlayBook
2.”  Amazon Swoops In  By not getting e-mail into the PlayBook from the outset,
RIM lost an opportunity to gain market share in a period when
some other tablets based on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android software
failed to catch on, said Fritzsche and Tavis McCourt, an analyst
at Morgan Keegan & Co. That prospect is now largely gone --
nabbed instead by Amazon.com Inc.’s two-month-old Kindle Fire
tablet, which is smaller than the iPad and similar in size to
the PlayBook, McCourt said.  “It’s an iPad market,” said McCourt, who is based in
Nashville,  Tennessee , and rates RIM “market perform.” He
expects RIM to ship 300,000 PlayBooks this quarter, with a drop
to 150,000 next quarter. “Every vendor has failed, with the
exception of Amazon.”  Amazon said in December that the Kindle Fire tablet had
been the top-selling product on Amazon.com since its September
unveiling and that the company was selling more than 1 million
of the tablets and Kindle e-readers a week.  Amazon (AMZN) ’s newest device hit store shelves on Nov. 14 and
quickly surpassed more-established tablets from Samsung
Electronics Co. and Barnes & Noble Inc. Last month, research
firm IHS Inc. estimated Amazon would ship 3.9 million Kindle
Fires in the last three months of 2011, making it the No. 2
tablet. Apple was projected to ship 18.6 million iPads.  Better Year?  One bit of good news for RIM is that after repeatedly
missing sales and profit targets and deadlines for new software,
PlayBook OS 2.0 is still scheduled for February, McCourt said.
RIM said on Jan. 9 that the free software upgrade “is expected
to be available” in February, without giving a more specific
time frame.  “That’s a positive,” McCourt said.  And RIM has added other tools to PlayBook OS 2.0 to entice
consumers attracted to the iPad. One new feature turns a
BlackBerry smartphone into a remote control for PlayBook users
to play movies on a connected big-screen TV. RIM says the
upgrade also includes BlackBerry Video Storefront, which will
offer “thousands of movies and TV shows” for rent the day they
appear on DVD.  New Features  To appeal to corporate customers, RIM said it has improved
the PlayBook’s ability to create and edit presentations and
transfer files from a laptop or desktop computer. Those
improvements may provide some additional incentive to enterprise
buyers that have held out for the e-mail upgrade, but guessing
the size of that potential market “is very hard to gauge” as
RIM’s grip on the corporate computing world loosens, said Alkesh Shah, an analyst at Evercore Partners Inc. in  New York . He  rates 
RIM “equalweight.”  “We should have done it earlier. But we’re doing it now,”
Saunders said last night. “It’s a great product. There are
going to be a lot of very happy people in February.”  RIM has had a better start to 2012 in the stock market as
well. After falling 75 percent last year to below its book
value, or the value of the company’s assets minus its
liabilities, the stock has climbed 7.7 percent this year,
compared with a 4.1 percent gain for the Nasdaq Composite Index.
RIM rose 0.6 percent today to $15.61 at the close in New York.  Fire Sales  Still, making any money from the PlayBook will be tough,
said  Matt Thornton , an analyst at Avian Securities LLC in
 Boston . RIM has cut the price of the PlayBook by as much as $400
to spur sales, wiping out any profit margin, he said.  The PlayBook with 64 gigabytes of memory now costs $300,
down from $700, on  Best Buy’s website . The basic 16-gigabyte
version is $300, down from $500.  “You can continue to bring out buyers with fire sales, but
RIM can’t make money at those prices,” said Thornton, who rates
RIM “neutral.”  “Volumes are going to be hard to come by, and margins are
less than smartphones,” he said. “When you roll that up, it
doesn’t amount to much.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
