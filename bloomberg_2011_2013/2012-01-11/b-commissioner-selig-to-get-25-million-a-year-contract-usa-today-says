Major League Baseball Commissioner
 Bud Selig  will receive a two-year contract extension that may
pay him $25 million annually,  USA Today  reported.  The deal will be approved at an owners’ meeting in Arizona
this week, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified baseball
official with knowledge of the accord.  Selig’s pay is tied to MLB revenue, which is more than $7
billion a year, USA Today said. In 2007, the most recent year in
which MLB tax documents are available, Selig earned $18.4
million, the report said. He agreed to a three-year contract
extension in 2009, it said.  Selig’s salary is by far the highest among commissioners in
the four major U.S. professional team sports, the report said,
with the NFL’s  Roger Goodell  the second-highest earner at more
than $10 million a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
