Iceland’s central bank Governor Mar Gudmundsson sued the bank for lowering his salary, Visir
reported, citing Lara V. Juliusdottir, chairman of Sedlabanki’s
board, and court documents.  Gudmundsson was appointed governor of Sedlabanki in August
2009 on a 1.6 million kronur ($12,600) monthly salary. An
independent wage commission that determines the pay of
government executives reduced his salary to a total of 1.3
million kronur in March 2010, the Reykjavik-based news service
 said .  Gudmundsson sued in December and the deadline for filing
documents is this month, Visir said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
