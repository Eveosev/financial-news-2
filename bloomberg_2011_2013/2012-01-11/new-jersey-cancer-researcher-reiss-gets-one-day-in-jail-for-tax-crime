A New Jersey cancer researcher who
admitted to hiding millions of dollars from U.S. tax authorities
in accounts at  UBS AG (UBSN)  and other Swiss banks was sentenced to a
day in jail and eight months in a halfway house.  Michael Reiss, 61, of Princeton, was also ordered today to
perform three years of community service by U.S. District Judge
Richard Berman in Manhattan.  Reiss pleaded guilty in August to failing to file reports
of foreign bank accounts in 2008 and 2009. As part of an
agreement with prosecutors, he paid a $1.2 million civil fine
plus $458,550 in taxes and interest he owed the government.
Reiss, a permanent U.S. resident and a citizen of the
Netherlands, may face deportation after he serves his sentence.  “I’m deeply sorry for the crimes I’ve committed against
this country that I owe so much to,” Reiss told the judge.  Reiss was a  professor  at the Cancer Institute of  New Jersey 
at the University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey’s Robert
Wood Johnson Medical School in  New Brunswick . He was forced to
leave because of the criminal conviction, he said.  For his community service, Reiss will work 30 hours a week
providing medical services for three organizations.  In 2009, Zurich-based  UBS (UBS)  paid $780 million to avoid
prosecution on charges that it helped Americans evade taxes and
turned over data on 250 secret accounts. It later handed over
information on 4,450 more accounts.  The case is U.S. v. Reiss, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
