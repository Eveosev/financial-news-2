Yemen postponed a debate and vote on
a draft law granting immunity to outgoing President Ali Abdullah Saleh to Jan. 14 because too few lawmakers turned up,
parliamentary speaker Yahia al-Raee said today in Sana’a.  The law, which also extends to the aides who worked with
Saleh during his 33 years in power, is part of a Gulf-brokered
accord signed in November transferring power to Vice President
Abdurabuh Mansur Hadi.  The opposition coalition, the Joint Meeting parties, has
suggested modifications to the draft law, which the Cabinet
passed three days ago, according to a report late yesterday on
the al-Wahdawi opposition website.  Suggestions include ensuring those who are pardoned aren’t
allowed to take up government posts and that an organization be
set up to care for the families of those who died during the 12-
month uprising demanding Saleh’s ouster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
