Jay Paterno is leaving  Pennsylvania
State University , where he spent 17 years as an assistant
football coach to his father, ESPN reported.  Paterno said he decided to leave his position as
quarterbacks coach after talking with new head coach Bill Oâ€™Brien, the New England Patriots offensive coordinator who was
hired Jan. 6 to succeed Joe Paterno.  Penn State  fired Joe Paterno on Nov. 9 because of the way
he handled a report by a junior assistant who said he saw former
assistant coach Jerry Sandusky sexually assaulting a boy in the
locker room showers in 2002. Paterno, 85, who was coach for a
record 46 years and 409 wins, has since been diagnosed with  lung
cancer .  Sandusky is awaiting trial on charges of sexual assault on
boys, which he denies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
