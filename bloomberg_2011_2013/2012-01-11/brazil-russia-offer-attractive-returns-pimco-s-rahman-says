Brazilian, Russian and Mexican local
markets offer the “most attractive” returns this year as low
debt levels allow them to weather the global economic slowdown,
according to Pacific Investment Management Co.  “Given it is likely to be a very challenging global
outlook, for  emerging markets  I believe the most attractive
opportunities really lie in those economies with very strong
balance sheets,” Lupin Rahman, a Newport Beach-based fund
manager at Pimco, which oversees the world’s largest bond fund,
said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. Brazil, Russia and
 Mexico  have “the ability to absorb any global shock,” she
said.  Economic growth in emerging markets is slowing with the
rest of the world and inflation has peaked, Rahman said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
