Douglas Holding AG (DOU) ,  Europe ’s largest
retailer of makeup and perfumes, said full-year profit rose 14
percent as sales in Germany expanded, and the company predicted
a “slight increase” in revenue.  Net income in the 12 months through September increased to
87 million euros ($111 million) from 76.1 million euros a year
earlier, the Hagen, Germany-based company said in a statement
today. Profit beat the 86 million-euro average of nine analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose to 3.38 billion
euros from 3.32 billion euros.  “The sales trend in our key home market of Germany has
been particularly satisfactory,” and the new fiscal year has
started “quite satisfactorily,” Chief Executive Officer
Henning Kreke said in a statement distributed at a news
conference in Dusseldorf,  Germany .  Germany’s retail sales probably rose within a range of 1.1
percent to 1.3 percent in 2011, according to preliminary
estimates by the country’s Federal Statistics Office. Sales in
October and November declined as the sovereign-debt crisis in
Europe weighed on consumers’ outlook for economic growth.  Douglas said in August that it wants to expand its online
business, create an e-commerce position on its management board
and offer “stronger online links” among its brands. The
company said today that its multichannel strategy offers a “big
opportunity.”  Perfume and cosmetic sales in Germany increased to 990.4
million euros from 946.7 million euros, while the division’s
revenue abroad declined to 888.2 million euros from 932 million
euros. Revenue at Douglas’s Christ jewelry division increased to
340.4 million euros from 310.2 million euros.  The company predicted that fiscal 2012 revenue will rise to
3.4 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
