CTC Media (CTCM)  Inc., a Russian television
network traded in the U.S., slid the most this month after
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  cut its recommendation on the stock,
citing declining audience share and slowing advertising revenue.  CTC Media sank 1.1 percent to $9.15 by 4 p.m. in New York,
the biggest one-day decline since Dec. 30. Goldman reduced the
Moscow-based company’s rating to “neutral” from “buy” and
cut its 12-month target price to $12.30 from $13.60, according
to a report by analysts including Alexander Balakhnin and Daria Fomina e-mailed today.  The average daily share of viewers for CTC’s television
channel, the company’s biggest source of advertising revenue and
Russia’s fifth-most-popular national station, fell to below 7
percent last month, from 7.5 percent in November and 7.9 percent
in October, according to weekly data from  TNS Gallup Media . CTC
uses TNS data in its financial reports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
