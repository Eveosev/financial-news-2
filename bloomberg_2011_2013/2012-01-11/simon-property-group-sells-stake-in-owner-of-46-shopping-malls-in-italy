Simon Property Group Inc., (SPG)  the
largest U.S. shopping mall owner, sold its stake in a venture
that owns 46 Italian shopping centers for an undisclosed sum to
its partner, French supermarket chain Auchan’s property arm.  Groupe Auchan SA’s  Immochan  unit acquired  Simon Property ’s
49 percent stake in Gallerie Commerciali Italia SpA, or GCI, to
own the business outright, according to a statement yesterday by
the property company based near Lille, France.  “Immochan’s increased holding in GCI allows the Auchan
Group to pursue its development in  Italy ,” the company said in
the statement.  Simon Property has scaled back its presence in Europe,
selling seven malls in France and Poland in 2010 that were held
in a venture with Caisse de Depot et Placement du  Quebec  to
Unibail-Rodamco SE for 715 million euros. The Indianapolis-based
company valued its stake in GCI, which also partly owns and
operates five retail parks, at $330.1 million as of the end of
2010, according to its annual report. A spokesperson for Simon
Property couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  Auchan, owned by France’s Mulliez family, operates 51 large
out-of-town supermarkets, or hypermarkets, in Italy and 1,700
supermarkets.  GCI’s  centers lease 570,000 square meters (5.38
million square feet) of property divided between 2,100 shops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
