Algeria is seeking to buy 50,000
metric tons of wheat in a tender for March delivery, Paris-based
farm adviser Agritel reported on its website today, without
saying where it got the information.  Syria  canceled a tender for 100,000 tons of wheat because
it considered the offered prices too high, Agritel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
