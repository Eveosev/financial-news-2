Astronomers have discovered the
three smallest planets ever found beyond the solar system, and
the smallest is the size of Mars, according to the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.  Using data from  NASA ’s Kepler Space Telescope to observe
flickers from a star called KOI-961, the scientists discovered
planets about .78, .73, and .57 times as large as Earth, the
agency said in a press release.  All three planets are probably rocky, like Earth, though
they are too close to their star to have liquid water. Their
orbit takes less than 2 days. The star is a  red dwarf , the most
common kind of star in the Milky Way, and is one-sixth the size
of the sun. The finding suggests there could be similar rocky
planets all over the galaxy, scientists said in the statement.  “Astronomers are just beginning to confirm thousands of
planet candidates uncovered by Kepler so far,” said Doug
Hudgins, who is a Kepler program scientist at NASA’s
headquarters in  Washington , in the statement. “Finding one as
small as Mars is amazing, and hints that there may be a bounty
of rocky planets all around us.”  The Kepler spacecraft was launched in 2009 to find
habitable planets. In February 2010, the mission identified
1,235 planets, about 68 or which are Earth-sized and about 54 of
which are in the habitable zone, which isn’t too hot or cold for
life. Five planets are both Earth-sized and in the habitable
zone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
