New Zealand ’s dollar touched a two-
month high before a report forecast to show a slowdown in
 China ’s inflation that may provide scope for monetary stimulus
in the South Pacific nation’s second-largest export destination.  The New Zealand dollar maintained three-day gains against
the greenback and the yen before a report that may show retail
sales in the U.S. grew for a fourth straight month, adding to
signs the world’s largest economy is recovering and supporting
investors’ appetite for riskier assets. Demand for the
Australian dollar was limited before  Spain  and Italy auction
debt this week amid concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening.  “If we see inflation slowing, it would give the PBOC room
to reduce  interest rates , which should obviously help the
Chinese economy to grow in the months ahead,” said Derek Mumford, a director in Sydney at Rochford Capital, a currency-
risk management company. Such stimulus from the People’s Bank of
China would boost both the Australian and New Zealand dollars,
he said.  New Zealand’s currency rose to 79.81 U.S. cents, the
highest since Nov. 9, before trading at 79.71 at 11:45 a.m. in
Sydney, little changed from yesterday’s close in  New York . The
so-called kiwi has climbed 2.1 percent this week versus the
dollar. It earlier rose to 61.35 yen, also the highest since
Nov. 9, before trading at 61.30 yen, 0.1 percent above
yesterday’s close.  Australia ’s dollar traded at $1.0312 from $1.0310 yesterday
and was at 79.30 yen from 79.24. It traded at 81.09 euro cents
from 81.14 yesterday, when it reached 81.20, a record high.  Australia’s government bonds advanced, with the yield on
10-year notes falling two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 3.76 percent.  Chinese Inflation  China’s consumer prices probably rose 4 percent in December
from a year earlier, according to median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News before the statistics bureau releases
its figures today. That would be the lowest inflation rate since
September 2010.  The PBOC announced a 50-basis-point cut to the reserve
requirement ratio for the nation’s banks in November, the first
reduction since 2008.  Sales at U.S. retailers probably rose 0.3 percent in
December, according to median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg, before the Commerce Department publishes the data
today.  The  Federal Reserve  said in its Beige Book survey released
yesterday that the  U.S. economy  “expanded at a modest to
moderate pace” from late November through year-end while hiring
was limited and housing remained stagnant.  Spain will sell bonds due in 2015 and 2016 today. Italy
will auction bills today and debt due in 2014 and 2018 tomorrow.  -- Editors: Benjamin Purvis, Jonathan Annells  To contact the reporter on this story:
