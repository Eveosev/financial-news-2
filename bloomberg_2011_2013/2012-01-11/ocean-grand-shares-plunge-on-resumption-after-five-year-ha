Ocean Grand Holdings Ltd. (1220) , the Hong-
Kong based aluminum producer whose shares have been suspended
for more than five years, fell as much as 65 percent to a record
on the city’s stock exchange after resuming trading today.  The company filed for protection from creditors in Hong
Kong in 2006 after discovering $105 million missing from its
books due to possible accounting irregularities at units in
 China . Founder and former chairman Yip Kim Po was sentenced to
seven years in prison after he and five other people, including
two directors, were convicted of defrauding the company, the
 China Daily   reported  in October 2010.  Ocean Grand resumed its aluminum business in June 2008,
according to a company filing. In September 2010, the  Hong Kong 
stock exchange approved its second appeal to resume share
trading, provided it fulfill compliance requirements.  The company reorganized its capital and debt to account for
accumulated losses of HK$2.6 billion ($335 million) for the year
ended March 31, 2011, it said. Ocean Grand met all conditions to
resume trading of its shares, it said on Jan 9.  Ocean Grand  fell  64 percent to close at 67 Hong Kong cents
on the city’s stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
