Archer Daniels Midland Co., the
world’s largest grain processor, plans to cut about 1,000 jobs,
or 3 percent of its workforce, to reduce costs.  The company will offer voluntary retirement incentives and
severance to achieve a significant portion of the job cuts, ADM
said today in a statement. When fully implemented, the work-
force reduction and other cost-cutting measures will trim annual
pretax expenses by more than $100 million, ADM said.  “To ensure that we can continue to compete effectively in
our global markets, we are taking actions to streamline our
organization and achieve significant, sustained cost
reductions,” Patricia Woertz, chief executive officer of
Decatur, Illinois-based ADM, said in the statement. “These
actions will help us enhance our productivity and earnings
power.”  ADM said it expects to record a $50 million to $75 million
pretax charge related to these actions in the quarter ending in
March, according to the statement.  ADM is among  agricultural companies  trimming costs and
reducing headcount. Closely held Cargill Inc. yesterday reported
an 88 percent drop in profit for the fiscal second quarter from
a year earlier and in December said it planned to cut as much as
2,000 jobs, or 1.5 percent of its global workforce.  ADM rose 0.5 percent to $28.93 at 12:13 p.m. in  New York .
 The shares  declined 10 percent in the 12 months through
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
