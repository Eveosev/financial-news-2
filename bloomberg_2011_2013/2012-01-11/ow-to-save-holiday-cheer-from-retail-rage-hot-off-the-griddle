Good morning, and welcome back to the Griddle, a menu of fortified items for the busy person's media diet. Countless shoppers left stores purple-faced with `retail rage' this holiday season. Companies wooed them by lowering prices, made possible by shaving costs, but failed to deliver a good shopping experience. For businesses competing in a tough economy, slashing employee headcount is an easy target -- just ask the 13 million Americans who are currently looking for work. But Marshall Fisher of the Wharton School of Business argues that eliminating jobs means cutting the muscle, not the fat, out of retail, as he explains in  this post  at the  Harvard Business Review  (our new content partner). He studied two years of store-level data and found revenue rose $10 for every extra dollar of payroll added to a store, and by as much as $28 for stores that were especially understaffed. For customers, employees and companies, better service really should be all the rage.
