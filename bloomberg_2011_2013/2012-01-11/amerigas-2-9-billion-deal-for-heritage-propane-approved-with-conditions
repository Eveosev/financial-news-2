Amerigas Partners LP (APU) , the largest
U.S. propane distributor, won antitrust approval for its
purchase of the Heritage Propane unit of  Energy Transfer
Partners LP (ETP)  on the condition that the deal excludes a cylinder
exchange business.  The Federal Trade Commission said today its settlement with
the companies resolves its claim that the deal, as originally
proposed, would have led to higher prices for the propane
exchange cylinders used by consumers to fuel barbeque grills and
patio heaters.  Without the exclusion, the $2.9 billion transaction “would
have substantially lessened competition in the nationwide market
for distributing and selling propane exchange cylinder services,
as well as in several smaller regional markets,” the FTC said
in a statement.  By cutting competitors in the industry from three to two,
the original proposal would also have ended the “maverick”
role played by Heritage Propane Express, which offered lower
prices and better terms to retailers than its rivals, the FTC
said.  The FTC will be able to review Dallas-based ETP’s sale of
Heritage Propane Express under terms of the settlement to ensure
that it remains a viable competitor after the sale, the FTC
said.  AmeriGas, based in King Of Prussia,  Pennsylvania , fell
61 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $42.64 at 12:55 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. ETP shares rose 8 7 cents to
$40.45.  To contact the reporter on this story:
