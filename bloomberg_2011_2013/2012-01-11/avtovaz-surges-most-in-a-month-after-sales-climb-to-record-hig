OAO AvtoVAZ (AVAZ) , the Russian carmaker
part-owned by Renault SA, rose the most in more than a month
after the chief executive of the French company said combined
sales increased to a record last year.  The shares added 9.2 percent to 22.05 rubles by the close
in Moscow, the biggest advance since Dec. 1.  Carlos Ghosn , who heads Renault and Nissan Motor Co., said
yesterday the carmakers and Russian partner  AvtoVAZ (AVAZ)  had
increased combined car sales 10 percent to a record in 2011.
Sales reached 638,000 at AvtoVAZ, Ghosn said at the Automotive
News World Congress in Detroit.  Nissan and Renault are in talks to own a majority of
AvtoVAZ, with Ghosn saying this week a deal may be completed
within weeks. Renault bought 25 percent of  Russia â€™s largest
carmaker in 2008 for $1 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
