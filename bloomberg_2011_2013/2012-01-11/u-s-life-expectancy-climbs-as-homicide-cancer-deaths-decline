U.S.  life expectancy  climbed to a
new high in 2010 as fewer people died from heart disease and
cancer, and homicide was no longer among the 15 leading causes
of death, the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  said.  Homicides fell 3.6 percent in 2010, dropping off the CDC’s
tally of leading causes of death and other vital U.S. statistics
for the first time in 45 years, according to preliminary data
released today by the agency. Life expectancy increased to about
78.7 years.  The homicide rate in 2010 was “the lowest it’s been since
1962,” accounting for 5.3 cases for every 100,000 people,
Sherry Murphy, the report’s lead author, said today in a
telephone interview. Killings have been among the top 15 causes
of death since 1965.  Pneumonitis, an inflammation of the lungs caused by
airborne irritants, chemotherapy or radiation therapy, replaced
homicide as the 15th biggest cause of death in 2010, according
to the report. While  heart disease  and cancer remained the top
two leading killers, accounting for 47 percent of fatalities,
deaths from heart disease declined 2.4 percent to 179 per
100,000 people, while cancer-related deaths dropped 0.6 percent
to 173 per 100,000, according to the CDC’s  National Center for
Health Statistics .  Living Longer  Almost 2.46 million people died in the U.S. in 2010, a 1.2
percent increase from the previous year, according to data
compiled from death certificates provided by all 50 states, the
 District of Columbia  and U.S. territories. Children born in 2010
can expect to live 37 days longer than those who entered the
world just a year earlier, the CDC said.  The homicide findings aren’t a surprise because murders in
the U.S. have been declining since the early 1990s, said  John
Eck , a professor of criminal justice at the University of
Cincinnati.  “It is a surprise to those who cling to the notion that
bad economic times cause crime to go up,” Eck said today in an
e-mail. “But the evidence for this has been weak at best and
this idea has probably always been more of a myth than a
reality.”  It’s a “a sign of the times” that homicide is no longer
among the nation’s 15 top causes of death, said  Chuck Wexler ,
executive director of the  Police Executive Research Forum , a
nonprofit in Washington.  “I don’t think it’s possible to point to any one factor,
but I do think we have seen major changes in how police and how
the community respond to crime” over the past decade, Wexler
said today in an interview.  Homicide Prevention  Los Angeles  and  Chicago  are among cities where police now
focus “not only on who did some crime, but on how they can
prevent the next crime,” such as retaliation for a gang-related
murder, Wexler said.  The national mortality rate, calculated according to 2010
census data, declined to a record low of 746.2 deaths for every
100,000 people, from 749.6 in 2009.  In addition to declines for heart disease and cancer, death
rates dropped for five other leading causes of death. Influenza
and pneumonia-related fatalities dropped by a combined 8.5
percent, while deaths from blood infections dropped 3.6 percent.
Fatal respiratory diseases, strokes and accidents also declined.  Mortality rates increased for five leading causes of death,
including Alzheimer’s and  Parkinson’s disease .  Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s  Deaths from  Alzheimer’s disease  rose 3.3 percent in 2010 to
25 fatalities per 100,000 people, while Parkinson’s-related
mortality increased 4.6 percent to 7 deaths for every 100,000
people, according to the report. Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s
retained their rankings from the previous year as the nation’s
6th and 14th leading causes of death.  The increase in deaths from Alzheimer’s may be partly a
result of “changes in terminology” on death certificates that
specify the disease instead of a “more generic dementia term,”
Murphy said.  The mortality rate from Parkinson’s has been “trending
up” in recent years, “but we can’t really say why that’s
happening,” she said.  Suicide also kept its spot as the 10th leading cause of
death in 2010, as the number of Americans who took their own
lives rose 2.4 percent to 37,793 from 36,909 in 2009.  While the CDC had previously reported that there were
36,547 suicides in the U.S. in 2009, and 741 deaths for every
100,000 people, the agency revised its 2009 mortality rates in
today’s report based on population data from the 2010 census.  To contact the reporter on this story:
