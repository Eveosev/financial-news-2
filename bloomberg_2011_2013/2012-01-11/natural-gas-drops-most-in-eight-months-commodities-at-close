The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
 Index (SPGSCI)  of 24 commodities fell 0.7 percent to close at 663.49 at
3:44 p.m. in  New York , led by natural gas.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials fell 0.3
percent to 1561.795.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures posted their biggest one-day decline in
eight months as revised forecasts showed milder weather across
much of the U.S. through late January, crimping demand for the
furnace fuel.  Natural gas for February delivery fell 16.7 cents to $2.774
per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the lowest settlement price since Sept. 4, 2009.  U.K. natural gas for next month advanced as cooler weather
was forecast to boost heating demand.  Gas for next month gained as much as 1.3 pence to 55.7
pence a therm. It was at 55.4 pence at 4:30 p.m. in  London ,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s equal to
$8.52 a million British thermal units.  BASE METALS  Copper futures rose to a four-week high on speculation that
China may loosen monetary policy to stimulate its economy,
boosting prospects for metal demand.  Copper futures for March delivery rose 0.9 percent to
settle at $3.546 a pound at 1:17 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the price reached $3.5565, the highest for a most-
active contract since Dec. 12.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months gained 0.5 percent to $7,780 a metric ton ($3.53 a
pound). Zinc, tin and lead also rose, while nickel fell.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Coffee futures rose the most in six weeks on speculation
that record output forecast in  Brazil , the world’s top grower,
isn’t keeping pace with gains in domestic demand and exports.
Cocoa and sugar gained, while cotton slid.  Arabica coffee for March delivery advanced 4 percent to
settle at $2.349 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S., the
biggest increase since Nov. 30. Earlier, the price reached
$2.352, the highest since Dec. 7. The contract was the biggest
gainer today among the 24 commodities tracked by the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  Cocoa futures for March delivery advanced 0.7 percent to
close at $2,350 a metric ton in New York, after touching $2,388,
the highest since Nov. 28. Prices have jumped 16 percent in
three days. A strike in  Nigeria , the fourth-largest producer,
has added to supply concerns as adverse weather threatens crops
in West Africa.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery climbed 1.6 percent to
23.69 cents a pound on ICE, the biggest gain since Jan. 3. The
sweetener plunged 27 percent last year as expanding crops in
 Asia  and  Europe  more than offset a decline in production in
Brazil, the top producer.  Cotton futures for March delivery dropped 0.1 percent to
96.87 cents a pound in New York, the first drop in four
sessions.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell as U.S. crude and fuel supplies climbed more than
expected and concern mounted that a contracting German economy
will drag Europe into recession.  Crude oil for February delivery declined $1.37, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $101.87 on the  New York Mercantile

Europe exchange.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold a 12th cargo of  North Sea 
Forties crude for January loading. Eni SpA failed to buy Russian
Urals on the Mediterranean even after raising its bid. North Sea  Shell sold a Forties cargo for Jan. 22 to Jan. 24 loading
to Morgan Stanley at 50 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders monitoring the
Platts trading window. Yesterday, Shell sold two shipments at
discounts of 40 and 60 cents.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil futures fell after the Energy Department
reported distillate demand slid 7.1 percent last week and
inventories rose to the highest level in 12 weeks.  February-delivery heating oil fell 3.68 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $3.0646 a gallon on the New York

week since July 2000.  Jet fuel premiums climbed in Europe as BP Plc bought a
barge for a second day. Benchmark gasoil dropped on London’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures rose to a four-week high as  China ’s physical

for a haven.  Gold futures for February delivery advanced 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,639.60 an ounce at 1:55 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the metal reached $1,648, the highest for a most-
active contract since Dec. 13.  Silver futures for March delivery gained 0.3 percent to
$29.89 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum rose to a four-week high, and palladium climbed

to $645.65 an ounce. The price gained 3.5 percent in the

the threat of crop damage from dry weather in  South America 
eased following rain in  Argentina  and forecasts for
precipitation in Brazil.  Soybean futures for March delivery dropped 2.4 percent to
