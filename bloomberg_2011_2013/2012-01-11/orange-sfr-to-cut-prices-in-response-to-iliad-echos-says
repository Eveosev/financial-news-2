French mobile telephone companies
are planning to cut prices after  Iliad SA (ILD) ’s Free yesterday
offered 19.99 euro ($26) a month unlimited service,  Les Echos 
reported, citing people at the companies involved.  Similar unlimited service costs between 78 and 85 euros at
 France Telecom SA (FTE) ’s Orange,  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s SFR, and Bouygues
Telecom, the newspaper said.  Executives at rivals doubt that Free can make a profit at
the prices it’s offering, Les Echos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
