Russia  will have “mainly
satisfactory” weather for winter grains in the 10 days starting
today, the state weather-forecasting center said.  Winter grains continued to grow during daylight in the
Southern and North-Caucasus federal districts because of “very
warm” weather in January’s first 10 days, the center said in a
statement on its  website . Local temperatures were between 7
degrees Celsius (44.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and 11 degrees
Celsius, it said. The districts are viewed as Russia’s main
source of grains for export.  Temperatures rose as high as 13 degrees Celsius in the
Southern district’s Krasnodar region in the 10-day period,
according to the center. Crops will experience limited further
growth on some days through Jan. 20 in southern parts of the
region, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
