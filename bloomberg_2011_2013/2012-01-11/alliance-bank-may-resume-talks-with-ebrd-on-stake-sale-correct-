Alliance Bank, a state-controlled
Kazakh lender, plans to resume talks on selling as much as a 25
percent stake to the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, Chief Executive Officer Maksat Kabashev said.  A sale will depend on Alliance’s capital surplus, Kabashev
told reporters today in Almaty,  Kazakhstan . The bank probably
had a surplus of 2 billion tenge ($13 million) last year under
international accounting standards, he said.  “I’m not aware of any talks with other investors,”
Kabashev said.  Kazakh state officials held talks on selling a stake in
Alliance to the EBRD in April last year, which would have made
it the first of the Kazakh banks that defaulted during the
financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 to attract an international
institutional investor, people familiar with the talks said at
the time.  Kazakhstan’s National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna holds 67
percent of Alliance’s ordinary shares after the bank, the first
Kazakh lender to default in 2009, restructured $4.5 billion of
debt.  The lender isn’t considering further debt restructuring
now, Kabashev said.  “Alliance Bank has successfully overcome the crisis years
2008-2010,” Kabashev said in a e-mailed statement from the
lender today. “Our plans for 2012 are even more ambitious in
terms of further improving the financial situation of the
bank.” Alliance plans to boost assets and liabilities by 19
percent this year, expanding its loan portfolio by 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
