Eritrea’s government accused
neighboring  Ethiopia  of jamming its satellite broadcasts and
threatened to take legal action, the Information Ministry said.  Ethiopia has been warned by the Arab Satellite
Communications Organization that the interference is illegal,
the Asmara-based ministry said in a statement on its website.  Ethiopian government spokesmen Bereket Simon and Shimeles
Kemal didn’t answer calls to their mobile phones seeking
comment.  Eritrea, formerly an Ethiopian province, won independence
after a 1993 referendum. The two countries fought a 1998-2000
border war that killed 70,000 people, according to the Brussels-
based International Crisis Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
