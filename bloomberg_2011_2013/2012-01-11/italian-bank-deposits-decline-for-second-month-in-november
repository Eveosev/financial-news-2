Italian household and corporate  bank
deposits  declined in November to the lowest in more than 12
months and lending to businesses and consumers grew at the
weakest pace in a year, the Bank of  Italy  said.  Corporate and household deposits fell 2.7 percent in
November, the Rome-based central bank said today in a report.
Bank lending increased 3.5 percent from a year earlier, the
least since November 2010, according to the report. Loans to
households rose at the slowest pace in more than a year.  Italian banks borrowed a record 210 billion euros ($286
billion) from the  European Central Bank  last month, 37 percent
more than in November, as their borrowing costs soared,
mirroring the rise in Italian government bond yields. Banks are
hoarding funds to meet refinancing needs for this year and are
parking most of the extra liquidity from loans granted by the
ECB at the institution.  November mortgage loan rates rose for the second month to
3.98 percent,  Bank of Italy  data show, even after the ECB cut
its benchmark  interest rate  by a quarter percentage point to
1.25 percent. The rates charged on corporate loans rose to the
highest in more than a year, the data show.  Non-financial companies cut deposits in November by 5.2
percent to 165.2 billion, while household deposits fell 1.4
percent to 815.8 billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
