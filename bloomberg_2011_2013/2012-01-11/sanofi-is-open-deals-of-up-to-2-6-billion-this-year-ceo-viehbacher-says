Sanofi, the French drugmaker that
bought Genzyme Corp. of the U.S., is planning “bolt-on”
acquisitions of up to 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) this year,
Chief Executive Officer  Chris Viehbacher  said.  Viehbacher, who defines his acquisition strategy as a
“string of pearls,” will keep on adding “more pearls” going
forward, the 51-year-old executive said in an interview in  San
Francisco  today.  Paris-based Sanofi will stick to transactions “in the
order of 1 billion to 2 billion euros per year,” Viehbacher
said. “It’s not a budget. I am pretty happy with the shape of
the company. All we want to do is continue to look for
opportunities, particularly in  emerging markets .”  Sanofi is interested in countries that “aren’t everybody’s
focus,” beyond  China  and India, Viehbacher said. It’s also
looking for deals to grow in animal healthcare, he said,
declining to name specific targets.   “The trick in M&A is to go find something not everybody is
looking at,” Viehbacher said.   Sanofi isn’t interested in acquisitions to grow in the
hepatitis C business, he said. It will privilege partnerships
and investments in “early-stage” assets to grow its research
pipeline, Viehbacher added.  The $20.1 billion takeover of Genzyme, the largest maker of
medicines for rare genetic disorders, was engineered to give
Sanofi access to innovative treatments that are less vulnerable
to generic competition.   Genzyme was a “bigger pearl than the others,” Viehbacher
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
