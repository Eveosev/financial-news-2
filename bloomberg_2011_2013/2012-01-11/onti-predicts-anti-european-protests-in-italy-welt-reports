There will be protests in  Italy 
against  Europe ,  Germany  and the  European Central Bank  unless
Italians soon see clear benefits resulting from their
willingness to step up savings and accept an economic revamp,
Germany’s  Welt  newspaper reported, citing an interview with
Italian Minister  Mario Monti .  “I am demanding heavy sacrifices from the Italians,”
Monti is citing as saying. “I can only do this if concrete
advantages become visible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
