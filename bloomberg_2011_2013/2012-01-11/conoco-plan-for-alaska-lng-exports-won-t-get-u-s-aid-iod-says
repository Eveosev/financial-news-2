ConocoPhillips (COP) ’ proposal to work
with other energy companies to export Alaskan natural gas to
Asia wouldn’t qualify for $21 billion in U.S. aid reserved for a
North American pipeline, the International Oil Daily reported.  The export of liquefied natural gas wouldn’t qualify for
loan guarantees authorized in the  Alaska  Natural Gas Pipeline
Act of 2004, Larry Persily, the U.S. government’s federal
coordinator for Alaska gas transportation projects, said Tuesday,
according to the Oil Daily.  ConocoPhillips has said it is in talks with  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) ,  BP Plc (BP/) , TransCanada Corp. and the state of Alaska to
evaluate the viability of the LNG-export project, the IOD said.  BP and ConocoPhillips dropped plans in May to build a $35
billion pipeline after failing to get enough customer interest.
 TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  and Exxon are behind a rival pipeline that may
cost as much as $41 billion.  The U.S. loan guarantee for the pipeline project,
originally authorized at $18 billion, was indexed to inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
