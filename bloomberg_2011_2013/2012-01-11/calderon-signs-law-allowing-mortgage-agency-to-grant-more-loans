Mexican President Felipe Calderon
signed into law a bill that would allow workers to get a second
home loan from the nation’s largest originator of mortgages,
known as Infonavit, to boost demand for housing.  The legislation also allows employees to recover payroll
deductions, automatically channeled to Infonavit, when they
haven’t exercised a loan.  Previously, Mexican workers were only allowed one mortgage
per person from Infonavit to acquire a new home or for household
improvements during the person’s working years.  Infonavit may now return as much as 18 billion pesos ($1.3
billion) to retired workers who never applied for a mortgage,
Martin Rico, head of the home committee in the lower house of
Congress, told reporters Nov. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
