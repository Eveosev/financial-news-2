TT Electronics Plc (TTG) , a U.K. maker of
car sensors for  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,
said it’s seeking acquisitions in  Asia  after eliminating debt.  The company, based in Weybridge,  England , had about 15
million pounds ($23 million) of net cash on Dec. 31, compared
with 9.9 million pounds of net debt at the start of 2011, it
said today in a Regulatory News Service statement. Trading in
the fourth quarter was in line with its forecasts and full-year
profitability was “significantly” ahead of 2010, it said.  TT Electronics seeks “acquisitions that would enhance our
offering into the target markets where we’re looking to grow,”
such as China, Indonesia and  India , Chief Executive Officer
Geraint Anderson said in a phone interview today.  Dominic Convey, an analyst at Peel Hunt with a “buy”
recommendation, said in a note that the “transformation of TT
Electronics remains on track,” management having “exceeded all
targets set in the strategic review two years ago.”  Anderson said the company had more than 110 million pounds
of debt when he joined as chief executive in 2008. It will
complete the closure of a facility in  North Carolina  by the end
of the year, he added.  The shares rose as much as 6.4 percent in London trading,
and closed up 5.71 percent, or 8.25 pence, at 152.75 pence. The
stock fell 21.8 percent in 2011 and has risen 13.6 percent so
far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
