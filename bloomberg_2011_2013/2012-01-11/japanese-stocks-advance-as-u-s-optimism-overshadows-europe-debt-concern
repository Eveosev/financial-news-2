Japanese stocks  advanced for a
second day as increased U.S. hiring boosted the earnings outlook
for exporters. Gains were limited before reports expected to
show Europe may be edging toward recession.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which depends on the U.S. for 20 percent of
its sales, rose 0.5 percent.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  climbed 3.2
percent on speculation the resignation of its wholesale banking
chief will allow the brokerage to revamp after overseas losses.
 Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , which operates the crippled Fukushima
Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, fell 6.1 percent after soaring as much
as 29 percent yesterday on speculation it will avoid delisting.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  gained 0.3 percent to 8,447.88
at the trading close in  Tokyo . The broader Topix Index added 0.2
percent to 733.47. Securities firms advanced the most among the
gauge’s 33 industry groups.  “There are more positive signs particularly on
employment” and  consumer spending  in the U.S., saidStephen Halmarick, Sydney-based head of markets research at Colonial
First State Global Asset Management, which oversees about $150
billion. “The outlook in the U.S. is for modest growth this
year, and that’s better than Europe. Expectations are Europe
will be in a recession.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.2 percent
today. The gauge rose 0.9 percent in  New York  yesterday to the
highest level since July 29.  U.S. Jobs  U.S. employers hired 4.15 million workers in November,
107,000 more than in the prior month, the Labor Department said
yesterday. Economists expect a report tomorrow will show retail
sales rose last month, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  Sony,  Japan ’s top exporter of consumer electronics, rose 0.5
percent to 1,350 yen.  Funai Electric Co. (6839) , a television maker
that gets half it sales in  North America , gained 2.5 percent to
1,970 yen.  Nomura rose after wholesale banking chief  Jesse Bhattal 
resigned. He is leaving after overseas operations posted their
biggest loss in at least six quarters and Moody’s Investors
Service said it was considering downgrading the brokerage.
Nomura gained 3.2 percent to 259 yen.  Daiwa Securities Group
Inc. (8601) , Japan’s second-largest brokerage, rose 2.5 percent to 251
yen.  European Concern  Gains in Japan’s stocks were limited before a report
expected to show  Germany ’s economic growth slowed to 3 percent
last year from 3.6 percent in 2010, according to analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. A separate report may show Spanish
industrial output slid 5.4 percent in November from a year
earlier after dropping 4 percent in October.  Fitch Ratings  said
Italy faces a “significant chance” of a downgrade, adding to
Europe’s debt concerns.  “Taking out the crisis premium means a credible
firewall,”  David Riley , head of the sovereign-debt unit at
Fitch, said at a conference yesterday in  London . “At the moment,
we don’t have that, and that’s a serious concern with respect to
Italy.”  Canon Inc., a camera maker that relies on Europe for a
third of its revenue, fell 0.9 percent to 3,285 yen.  Tokyo Electric, also known as Tepco, fell 6.1 percent to
202 yen. It jumped 24 percent yesterday after the Nikkei
newspaper reported the government will buy its shares, adding to
optimism the company will remain on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Olympus Corp. (7733) , the scandal-hit optics maker, slid 2.6
percent to 1,230 yen. The shares soared as much as 28 percent
yesterday after the Nikkei reported the company will probably be
fined by the Tokyo Stock Exchange rather than being delisted for
hiding losses.  Bridgestone Shakeup  Bridgestone Corp. (5108)  fell 1.5 percent to 1,723 yen after
competitor Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. said yesterday it faces
soft global demand. Bridgestone announced management changes
during today’s trading break. President Shoshi Arakawa was named
chairman and Masaaki Tsuya will be chief executive officer.  Japanese stocks tumbled last year amid a strengthening yen,
natural disasters and nuclear meltdowns at Tepco’s Fukushima
plant. The Topix dropped 19 percent in 2011, the biggest yearly
decline since 2008, exceeding an 11 percent decline on the Stoxx
 Europe  600 Index that tracks companies at the epicenter of the
region’s debt crisis.  The price of shares on the Topix is  valued  at 0.89 times
estimated book value, near the lowest since March 2009. A number
below one means investors can buy companies for less than the
value of their assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
