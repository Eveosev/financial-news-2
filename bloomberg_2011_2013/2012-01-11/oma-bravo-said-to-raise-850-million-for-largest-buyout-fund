     Jan. 11 (Bloomberg) --Thoma Bravo LLC, one of the two
private-equity firms that spun out of Chicago-based buyout
pioneer Golder Thoma & Co., has raised $850 million so far for
what would be its largest fund, according to a person familiar
with the matter.  The firm started raising money for the fund, Thoma Bravo
Fund X LP, in the second half of last year with an aim to gather
$950 million, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the information is private. The firm, based in  Chicago ,
plans to raise $1.2 billion by next month and won’t accept any
more money from investors, the person said.  Thoma Bravo’s new fund would be larger than its $822.5
million predecessor raised in 2008. That pool of capital has
produced a net internal rate of return of more than 45 percent
as of Sept. 30, the person said. The firm returned more than $1
billion to investors in its previous two funds during the six
months prior to the fundraising, the person said.  Thoma Bravo last year sold one of its companies, Flexera
Software Inc., to the private investment unit of the  Ontario
Teachers’ Pension Plan .  It sold another company, Excelligence
Learning Corp., to private-equity firm Sterling Investment
Partners.  Amy Coleman Redenbaugh, chief financial officer of Thoma
Bravo, declined to comment on fundraising.  Thoma Bravo, with offices in Chicago and  San Francisco ,
invests $50 million to $150 million per deal in software,
education, and business and financial-services companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
