China Everbright International Ltd. (257) ,
a Hong Kong-based renewable energy company, signed a $100
million loan today for the development of waste-to-energy plants
in  China .  A media conference to mark the signing was held in Hong
Kong. Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. and Hang Seng Bank Ltd. are the
loan’s bookrunners and mandated lead arrangers and Bank of
Kaohsiung, Cathay United Bank Co., Chang Hwa Commercial Bank and
Export Development Canada also joined the facility.  The loan signed today is the commercial portion of a $200
million A/B financing from the Asian Development Bank. In A/B
financing, a borrower signs a single agreement with a
development bank, which retains a part of the loan, known as the
A loan, and distributes the rest to commercial banks. The
commercial portion is known as the B loan.  Under this arrangement, commercial banks don’t have
recourse to the  development bank , the lender of record, in a
default. In the event of a default, the development bank seeks
payment from the borrower and is usually pari passu with the
commercial lenders. Pari passu is when lenders have equal access
to payments.  The ADB agreed to provide the $100 million A loan in 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That loan has a
maturity of 10 years with a grace period of three years, Hisaka
Kimura, the ADB’s head of private sector infrastructure finance
for east  Asia , said after today’s press event. The B loan has a
tenor of five years and a grace period of 18 months, said
Kimura.  To contact the reporter on this story:
