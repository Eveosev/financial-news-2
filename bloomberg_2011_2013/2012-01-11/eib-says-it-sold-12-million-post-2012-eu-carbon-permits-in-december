The  European Investment Bank  said it
sold 12 million carbon permits in December from a special post-
2012 reserve in the European Union emissions trading system to
help aid low-emissions technologies.  The Luxembourg-based bank got an average price of 8.15
euros ($10.35) per allowance in the first month of sales from
the 300 million-permit EU reserve for new entrants to the bloc’s
cap-and-trade program, known as NER300, according to a report
published on its website. The EU decided in 2008 to use proceeds
from the sales to encourage renewable energy and carbon capture
projects.  Permits for delivery in December 2013 declined 1.3 percent
to 7.61 euros on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London
today, valuing the reserve at 2.3 billion euros, compared with
as much as 6 billion euros in May. The contract lost 44 percent
over the past six months on oversupply concerns and speculation
the debt crisis in the region using the euro may worsen.  “The reported 12 million tons sold by the EIB during
December is slightly higher than our estimates of 10 million
tons,” said Konrad Hanschmidt, an analyst at Bloomberg New
Energy Finance in  London . “With many traders still expecting
the volumes to be closer to 20 million tons it may have a
bearish impact on prices tomorrow morning and push prices below
7 euros a ton for the rest of the week.”  NER300 allowances are the first brought to market from the
next phase of the EU emissions trading system, or the ETS, that
begins in 2013. The ETS, which imposes pollution limits on more
than 11,000 power plants and manufacturers, started in 2005 and
is now in the second phase running from 2008 to 2012. Every
permit carries the right to emit one metric ton of CO2.  Lower Sales Level  The bank began selling permits on Dec. 5 and sales were
conducted throughout the whole month, adapted to levels of
liquidity in the market, according to a senior EIB official
speaking today, who declined to be identified, citing EIB
policy. He said the bank kept sales at a lower level during the
second half of December, when liquidity is historically low.  “Volumes sold per trading day varied between 200,000 and
1,100,000 allowances during the reporting month, depending on
the available liquidity during the holiday period.” the bank
said in the report.  Expected proceeds on sales from the reserve is for at least
eight carbon-capture projects and 34 renewable-energy systems
covering as much as half the construction and operating costs
that companies and national governments will also help finance.  300 Million Permits  Clean-energy technologies will help the EU meet its climate
goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent in 2020
compared with 1990 levels. The aid, known as NER300, is on top
of subsidies approved in 2009, when the bloc allocated one-fifth
of a 5 billion-euro economic-stimulus package for carbon-capture
projects by utilities including Vattenfall AB,  Endesa SA (ELE)  and
 Enel SpA. (ENEL)  It earmarked 565 million euros for offshore wind power
initiatives.  The European Commission transferred 300 million permits
from the NER300 reserve to the EIB on Dec. 2 and the bank has to
sell the first tranche of 200 million by Oct. 2. The EIB has
signaled it planned to start sales soon after the transfer, with
implied indicative volumes of 20 million permits a month.  The bank said today all December sales were done through
over-the-counter deals and the bank will add other channels in
the coming months. Those will include ICE Futures Europe and the
 European Energy Exchange  during the first quarter of this year,
with exact timing depending on the EIB exchanges membership, as
well as auctions in the second quarter.  OTC Trades  “We were careful to ensure that no information in advance
was given to market participants during the execution of OTC
trades,” the EIB official said today from Luxembourg. “No
single player was able to benefit from knowledge of allowances
sales activity as counterparts were at no time aware of the
overall sales target.”  Allowances from the reserve are equivalent to about 15
percent of the average annual quota in the current 2008 to 2012
trading period of the EU emissions-trading system. The NER300
permits can, at the earliest, be used to cover greenhouse gas
discharges in 2013.  The next monthly report on NER300 sales will be available
on Feb. 9, according to the EIB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
