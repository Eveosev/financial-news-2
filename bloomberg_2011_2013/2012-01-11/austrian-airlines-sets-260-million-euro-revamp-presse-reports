Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) â€™s Austrian
Airlines unit aims to save 260 million euros ($331 million)
starting in 2014 under a reorganization program, Die Presse
 reported , without saying where it got the information.  Profit will already improve by about 200 million euros this
year under the plan, the Vienna-based newspaper said.  Two-thirds of earnings improvement will be generated by
cost reductions and one-third will come from higher revenue,
Austrian Airlines said yesterday in a statement announcing the
program, without specifying any figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
