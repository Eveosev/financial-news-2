New York (STONY1)  regulators are looking into
whether banks and insurers profit excessively from the insurance
polices they require homeowners to pay for when their original
coverage lapses, the  Wall Street Journal  reported.  Financial Services Superintendent Benjamin M. Lawsky
subpoenaed agents and brokerages run by large banks about so-
called forced-place insurance, the newspaper said, citing people
it didnâ€™t identify. David Neustadt, a spokesman for the
department, declined to comment on the report when reached by
Bloomberg News.  Lenders who require homebuyers to maintain insurance on
property that serves as collateral may unfairly force borrowers
into overly expensive new policies if their own lapses, the
Journal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
