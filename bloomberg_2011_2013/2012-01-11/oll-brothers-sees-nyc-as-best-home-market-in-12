New York City  is going to be the
strongest housing market for  Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL)  in 2012, Chief
Executive Officer Douglas Yearley Jr. said today.  “ New York  City. Absolutely,” Yearley said in an interview
on Bloomberg Television's ``InsideTrack.''  The luxury-home builder has completed 13 properties in the
New York metropolitan area under its City Living brand and is
developing four more, the Horsham, Pennsylvania-based company
said in a Dec. 7 statement. City Living has been Toll’s most
popular division because demand for housing is stronger in New
York than in other parts of the country, Yearley said in
September.  Last month, Toll said it was forming a joint venture with
Equity Residential, the largest publicly traded U.S. apartment
owner, to build a 40-story tower on Manhattan’s Park Avenue. The
bottom 22 floors will house retail and rental apartments and be
operated by Chicago-based  Equity Residential. (EQR)  Toll’s portion
will consist of condominiums on the upper 18 floors.  Nationwide, Toll Brothers expects to sell “not that much
more” than 2,600 homes in 2012, Yearley said in today’s
interview. If the traditional spring selling season is strong,
the company could deliver as many 3,200 houses this year, he
said. The company sold 2,611 homes in fiscal 2011, according to
its Dec. 6 earnings statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
