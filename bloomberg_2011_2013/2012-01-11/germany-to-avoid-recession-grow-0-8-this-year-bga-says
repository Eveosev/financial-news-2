The German economy will avoid a
recession and expand 0.8 percent this year, a company survey by
the BGA association of wholesalers and exporters showed.  German wholesale trade will rise to an all-time high of 887
billion euros ($1.1 trillion) even as sales grow just 1 percent
in real terms, the BGA said today in an e-mailed statement.
Wholesalers will add 5,000 new jobs this year after hiring
20,000 people in 2011, the BGA said.  “Based on the current sentiment, we can’t and don’t want
to share the economic pessimism that can often be seen,”  Anton Boerner , the Berlin-based BGA’s president, said in the
statement. “We trust in the ability of German businesses to
adjust and perform and are firmly convinced that they can master
the challenges.”  Europe ’s largest economy is cooling as slower global growth
and weaker demand from debt-stricken euro-area neighbors erode
foreign sales.  Gross domestic product  increased 3 percent last
year after gaining 3.7 percent in 2010, the most since German
reunification two decades ago, the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said today.  BGA’s wholesale business climate indicator for the first
half of 2012 fell to 128.5 from 130.1 in the second half of last
year. A sub-index for the current business situation declined to
133.4 from 133.6 while a sub-measure of business expectations
dropped to 123.6 from 126.7. Figures above 100 reflect a
“positive” assessment, the BGA said.  “There can be no talk of a recession, even if we have to
say goodbye to high growth rates this year,” Boerner said.  The BGA didn’t say how many companies participated in the
poll and what the margin of error was. It didn’t say when the
survey was conducted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
