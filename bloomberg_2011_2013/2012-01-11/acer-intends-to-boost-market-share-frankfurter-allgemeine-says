Acer Inc. (2353) , a Taiwan-based computer-
maker, wants to regain lost ground in the notebook computer
market, the  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing
Oliver Ahrens, who heads the company’s European business.  Acer is aiming for 25 percent to 28 percent market shares
“in its regions” by the end of 2013, up from 13 percent
currently, the newspaper said, adding that Acer has a 16.5
percent market share in Europe, according to Ahrens.  While notebooks will stay at the forefront of the company’s
 product  line, Ahrens said tablets could in future account for 10
percent to 15 percent of its business, up from 6 percent to 8
percent today, the FAZ reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
