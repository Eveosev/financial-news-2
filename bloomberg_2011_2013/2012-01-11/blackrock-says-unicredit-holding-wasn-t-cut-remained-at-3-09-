Italy’s securities market watchdog,
Consob, is reviewing statements by  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  about its
stake in  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  after the U.S. fund said it hadn’t cut
the holding as previously announced.  BlackRock said today it owned 3.09 percent of UniCredit as
of Dec. 28 and that a Jan. 2 filing in which it said it had
reduced the holding to 1.7 percent was mistaken. Consob is
reviewing the announcements as part of its oversight of market
abuse, said an official at the regulator, who declined to be
identified because of internal policy.  “The announcement made by BlackRock a few days before the
start of UniCredit’s rights offer may have penalized the stock,
contributing to the sell-off,” said Wolfram Mrowetz, chairman
of investment firm Milan-based Alisei SIM in Milan.  UniCredit on Jan. 9 started selling 7.5 billion euros ($9.5
billion) of shares in Italy’s biggest rights offer since 2009 to
boost  capital ratios  and comply with the European Banking
Authority’s targets. Chief Executive Officer  Federico Ghizzoni 
is also cutting costs and reducing staff to strengthen finances
and improve profitability.  A spokeswoman for BlackRock in Milan couldn’t immediately
be reached for comment. A spokesman at UniCredit declined to
comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
