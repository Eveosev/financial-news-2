The U.S. bond market surge that has
pushed debt yields to record lows may constitute a “bubble,”
said  Robert Shiller , a Yale University economics professor who
predicted the collapse of the U.S. housing market.  “I would say we’re at record low” on long-term rates, the
co-creator of the S&P/Case-Shiller home-price index said today
at a conference in Oslo. There has been “gradually increasing
confidence in  U.S. debt ” in the past 30 years, he said.  Demand for Treasuries has pushed U.S. government debt due
in 10 years or more up 28 percent in the past 12 months, the
most among 144 government-bond indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Ten-
year yields fell more than 140 basis points in 2011 as  Europe ’s
debt crisis intensified.  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.95 percent at 8:11 a.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. Yields dropped
to a record low 1.67 percent on Sept. 23.  Shiller is also the author of “ Irrational Exuberance ,” a
book published in 2000 that predicted the stock market collapse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
