Serbia’s foreign-currency reserves
totaled 12 billion euros ($15.24 billion) at the end of 2011,
660 million euros higher than in 2010, as banks raised funds to
meet mandatory  reserve requirements , the central bank said.  Net reserves, excluding the funds commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and funds from the  International Monetary
Fund , rose to 6.66 billion euros from 6.61 billion euros in
November, the National Bank of Serbia said today in an e-mail.
This equaled 430 percent of M1 money supply, down from 448
percent in the previous month, or about eight months of imports.  The Balkan country’s foreign-exchange reserves rose after
banks added 555.4 million euros to their mandatory reserve
accounts. Another 31.8 million euros arrived through credits and
donations, while debt repayments to external creditors were 51
million euros, the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said.  Interbank trading volumes expanded by 936.8 million euros
to reach 2.1 billion euros, with the full-year total reaching
19.5 billion euros, the most in three years.  The dinar weakened 0.6 percent against the euro in December
and was 0.8 percent stronger on the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
