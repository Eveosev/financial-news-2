India  is “better placed” in BRIC
nations as Brazil faces slowing growth, Russia’s economy isn’t
“well diversified” and  China ’s model is being “challenged,”
New York University professor Nouriel Roubini said.  “In relative terms, India is actually positioned well,”
Roubini said in an interview with Bloomberg UTV in  New Delhi 
today. At the same time, the pace of “structural reforms” in
India has been “mediocre” and unless India pushes ahead with
those changes, economic growth in “absolute terms” will
“disappoint,” he said.  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s efforts to bolster the
Indian economy have been hampered by corruption scandals,
inflation and the decision last month to stall the easing of
foreign investment rules in multibrand retail. Still, the
government yesterday ratified a Nov. 24 cabinet decision to
raise the ownership limit for overseas single-brand retailers to
100 percent from 51 percent.  India’s economy  expanded 6.9 percent in the third quarter
of 2011. By comparison, Brazil’s economy grew 2.1 percent,
Russia’s by 4.8 percent and China’s by 9.1 percent in the same
period.  Roubini, co-founder and chairman of Roubini Global
Economics LLC, predicted the U.S. housing bubble before the
market peaked in 2006, while failing to predict a rebound in
global stocks in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
