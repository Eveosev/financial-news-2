Lyxor Asset Management started four
commodity exchange-traded funds tied to returns of the Standard
& Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials.  The funds on the London Stock Exchange will invest in
equities, not necessarily tied to commodities, and provide a
total return of the S&P GSCI through a swap with  Societe
Generale , Lyxor’s parent company, said Nizam Hamid, deputy head
of Lyxor ETFs in London. Lyxor has two other commodity-based
ETFs tied to the CRB which started in 2006 and now have 1.2
billion euros ($1.52 billion) in assets, Hamid said.  “There is definite client interest especially in an
exchange-traded fund structure compared to other exchange-traded
products,” Hamid said. “Other ETPs are debt, so if you they
have no collateral you would be an unsecured creditor of the
issuer.”  Two of the Lyxor funds are in  livestock  and  agriculture ,
one for higher prices and the other for the inverse, and the two
others are in industrial metals, also for a  gain  or a  decline .  To contact the reporter on this story:
