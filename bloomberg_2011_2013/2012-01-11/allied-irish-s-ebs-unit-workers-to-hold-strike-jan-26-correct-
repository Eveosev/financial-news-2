     (Corrects date of strike in headline and first graf.)  EBS Ltd. staff will hold a second
one-day strike on Jan. 26 because of the Dublin-based lender’s
decision to withhold a Christmas payment to workers, labor union
Unite said in a statement.  “Pickets will also be placed at the offices” of EBS’s
parent company  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK) , Unite said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
