Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts declined for a fourth day after a report
showing inflation unexpectedly fell in January bolstered
speculation the central bank will speed the pace of borrowing-
cost cuts.  The yield on the contract due in January 2013 dropped two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 9.98 percent at 9:49
a.m. in  Sao Paulo .  Yields on most futures contracts declined after prices, as
measured by the first preview of the IGP-M report, fell 0.01
percent in January, the Rio de Janeiro-based Getulio Vargas
Foundation said today. The median estimate of 13 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for an increase of 0.1 percent.  “Inflation is converging to the central bank’s scenario,”
Mauricio Junqueira, who helps oversee about $300 million at
Squanto Investimentos in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone
interview. “That means at least two more cuts of 50 basis
points, and the possibility of more.”  The real weakened 0.4 percent to 1.8064 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1.7996 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
