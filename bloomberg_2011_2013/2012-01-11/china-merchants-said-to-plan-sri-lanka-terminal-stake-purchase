China Merchants Holdings
(International) Co. (144)  plans to increase its stake in an under-
construction Sri Lankan container terminal, according to two
people familiar with the situation.  The company, the largest shareholder in the facility, is
considering acquiring at least some of  Aitken Spence & Co. ’s 30
percent stake as the Colombo-based partner is quitting the
project, said the people who declined to be identified as the
discussions are private. The Sri Lanka  Port Authority  may also
buy some of the Spence holdings, one of the people said.  China Merchants, which owns 55 percent of the venture, in
August signed an agreement to build and operate the facility in
 Colombo , Sri Lanka’s biggest port, because of rising Southeast
Asia trade. The terminal will cost about $500 million to build
and have an annual capacity of 2.4 million containers.  Hong Kong-based China Merchants wasn’t immediately able to
comment, it said by e-mail. Spence’s Managing Director J.M.S. Brito was unavailable when called at his office and didn’t
answer at least five calls to his mobile phones.  Sri Lanka  Ports Authority Chairman Priyath Wickrama
declined to comment. The state agency owns 15 percent of the
terminal.  Spence is pulling out of the venture partly because of
rising costs,  Daily FT , a Sri Lankan newspaper, reported today,
citing unidentified people.  To contact the reporters on this story:
