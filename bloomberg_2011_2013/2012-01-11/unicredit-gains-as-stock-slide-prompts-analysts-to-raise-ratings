UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,  Italy ’s biggest bank,
climbed as much as 17 percent in Milan, the best performer,
before tomorrow’s deadline for trading the rights to its stock
sale.  The share performance shows the Milan-based bank’s 7.5
billion-euro ($9.7 billion) capital increase is “going well,”
Chief Executive Officer  Federico Ghizzoni  told reporters today.
The rights traded 34 percent higher at 2.58 euros at 4:25 p.m.  The lender is raising the money to plug a capital shortfall
and comply with the European Banking Authority’s targets.
Ghizzoni is also cutting costs and reducing staff to boost
profitability after the Milan-based lender reported a third-
quarter loss of 10.6 billion euros.  UniCredit climbed 11.4 percent to 3.31 euros, the best
performer on the benchmark FTSE MIB index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
