Container traffic through the Kenyan
port of  Mombasa , East Africa’s biggest, may increase 1.2 percent
this year, the Kenya Ports Authority said.  Traffic may climb to 800,000 twenty-foot equivalent units
following growth of 12 percent to 790,000 TEUs last year,
Gichiri Ndua, managing director of the authority, told reporters
today at the port.  The higher volume will require Kenya’s transport industry
to improve the country’s road networks as most containers that
leave the port are delivered by road, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
