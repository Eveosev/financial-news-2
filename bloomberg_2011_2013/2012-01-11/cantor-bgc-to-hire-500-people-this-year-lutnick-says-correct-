Cantor Fitzgerald  & Co., the New
York-based investment bank, and its BGC Partners unit will hire
more than 500 people this year, Chief Executive Officer Howard Lutnick said.  Cantor Fitzgerald, which focuses on the mid-market, will
hire about 200 people while inter-dealer broking arm BGC
Partners will hire between 300 and 400, Lutnick said on
Bloomberg Television today.  “These markets give us the opportunity to hire people you
never thought would leave the big firms,” he said. “We are in
a sweet spot.”  Securities firms cut more than 200,000 jobs last year as
trading slumped and deals were pulled amid declining economic
growth and the sovereign-debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
