Chile ’s peso gained for a second day
as traders cut their forecasts for interest-rate declines,
betting the central bank will leave borrowing costs on hold for
a seventh straight month in tomorrow’s policy meeting.  The peso gained 0.5 percent to 505.90 per  U.S. dollar  at
11:04 a.m. Santiago time after surging 1 percent yesterday. The
three-month interest-rate swap was unchanged at 5.08 percent.  Policy makers will leave the  key rate  at 5.25 percent
tomorrow before cutting to 4.5 percent by January next year,
according to a bi-weekly survey of traders and investors
released by the central bank today. In the previous survey they
forecast cuts would start in January and reach 4.25 percent by
January next year. Traders also raised forecasts for consumer
price increases after inflation exceeded the target in 2011.  “Copper remains solid, and as long as it remains above
$3.5 per pound it will keep pressuring the peso up,” said
Sergio Tricio, an analyst at ForexChile. “The market is betting
that the central bank will keep rates unchanged and that is also
strengthening the peso.”  Copper for delivery in March, which surged 2.8 percent in
 New York  yesterday, rose as much as 1.2 percent today before
sliding 0.3 percent to $3.5035 at 9:11 a.m. local time. Copper
accounts for more than half of Chile’s exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
