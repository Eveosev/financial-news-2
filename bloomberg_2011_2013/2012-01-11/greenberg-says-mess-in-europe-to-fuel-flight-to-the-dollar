Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, the
chairman and chief executive officer of C.V. Starr & Co., said
investors will increase bets on the U.S. currency to limit the
risk of losses from what he called a “mess” in  Europe .  “There’ll be a flight to the dollar,” Greenberg said
today in a Bloomberg Television interview with Betty Liu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
