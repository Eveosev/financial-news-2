The European Commission is
investigating whether new Austrian rules for the country’s
banks’ eastern European units are violating European Union
rules, Austrian newspaper  Der Standard  reported.  The Commission, the EU’s executive body, was alerted by
several eastern European finance ministers, which fear the rules
may crimp growth in their countries, the Vienna-based newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The rules, which demand that  Austria ’s top three banks fund
their lending in eastern  Europe  mostly via deposits, may be
inconsistent with the EU’s rules on the free movement of
capital, Der Standard said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
