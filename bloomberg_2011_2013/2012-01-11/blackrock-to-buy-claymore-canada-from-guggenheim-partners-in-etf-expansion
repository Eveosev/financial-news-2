BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest
asset manager, agreed to buy Claymore Canada from Guggenheim
Partners LLC to expand its offering of exchange-traded funds in
that country.  The transaction, the terms of which weren’t disclosed, will
add 34 ETFs and two closed-end funds with C$7 billion ($6.9
billion) under management, according to a statement today. The
deal is scheduled to close by the end of the first quarter and
will be “neutral to modestly accretive” to full-year earnings,
New York-based BlackRock said.  BlackRock, which in December 2009 acquired  Barclays Global
Investors  to become the biggest provider of ETFs in the world,
already manages C$29 billion in Canada through its iShares unit,
the largest seller of ETFs in  Canada . Claymore is the second-
biggest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Guggenheim acquired the ETF business through its purchase
of Claymore Group LLC, announced in July 2009 and completed
later that year. In 2010, when it rebranded Claymore’s U.S.-
registered funds and business units under the Guggenheim name,
Toronto-based Claymore Investments kept its brand.  BlackRock manages $3.3 trillion in assets worldwide through
mutual funds, institutional accounts and ETFs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
