A Russian-owned ship carrying
munitions, which was detained by Cyprus authorities yesterday
while en route to  Syria , didn’t violate the European Union’s
arms embargo against Syria, Cyprus’s  foreign ministry  said .  Customs and port authorities checked documents and the
cargo on the vessel, which flies the St. Vincent flag and is
called the Chariot, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Westberg Ltd., the ship’s St. Petersburg-based owner,
decided to change its destination, after which it was allowed to
put into Limassol for refueling. It was permitted to keep its
cargo, government spokesman  Stefanos Stefanou  said earlier.  The vessel’s agent, the Limassol-based  EDT Offshore , said
the ship will sail for Iskenderun, in southeast  Turkey . “She is
still refueling,” Michalis Sokratous, an EDT official, said in
a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
