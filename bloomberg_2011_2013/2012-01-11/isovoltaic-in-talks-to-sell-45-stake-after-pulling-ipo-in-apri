Isovoltaic AG (ISO) , the Austrian solar
company that canceled an initial public offering last year, may
sell a 45 percent stake to outside investors.  Talks with potential buyers are at a “very early stage,”
Klaudia Schober, a spokeswoman for the Lebring-based maker of
protective backing for solar panels, said today by telephone.  The company halted its 378 million-euro ($479 million) IPO
in April as  Europe ’s debt crisis sapped investor demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
