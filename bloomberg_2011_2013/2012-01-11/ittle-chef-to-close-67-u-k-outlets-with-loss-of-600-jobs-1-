Little Chef,  the U.K. roadside
restaurant chain founded in 1958, said it plans to close 67
unprofitable locations with the loss of as many as 600 jobs,
reducing its size to fewer than 100 outlets.  The restaurants being shut have been losing money for
several years due to a “variety of economic and locational
factors,” the company said today in a statement.  The closures extend the decline of Little Chef, which had
more than 400 restaurants at the end of the 1990s. The U.K.
market has become more crowded in the last decade amid expansion
by fast-food chains such as  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  and the addition of
stores such as Marks & Spencer Group Plc’s Simply Food.  The 94 surviving Little Chef outlets are profitable and
employ 1,500 people, according to the company, which was bought
by RCapital Ltd. from People’s Restaurant Group Ltd. in 2007.  Little Chef said it plans to expand by opening new sites in
coming years and continues to “trade strongly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
