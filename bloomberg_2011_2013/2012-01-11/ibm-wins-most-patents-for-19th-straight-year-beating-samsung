Corp. (IBM)  won a record number of U.S. patents in 2011, its 19th
straight year on top, as some Asian competitors advanced in the
rankings at the expense of  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Intel Corp. (INTC)   IBM, the world’s biggest computer-services provider, gained
6,180 patents last year, researcher IFI Claims Patent Services
said in a  statement .  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  was second, its
growth outpacing IBM, and Canon Inc. replaced Microsoft as
third.  Panasonic Corp. (6752)  moved up to No. 4 and  Toshiba Corp. (6502) 
advanced to fifth spot.  A patent portfolio spanning from computer memory to online
shopping provides Armonk, New York-based IBM with licensing
revenue and protection against intellectual-property
infringement lawsuits. That means IBM is spending less time in
courts than competitors, Manny Schecter, IBM’s chief patent
counsel, said in an interview before the numbers were released.  “Everyone knows that if they attempt to bring their patent
portfolio against us that they will be met with an equal and
opposite force -- and it will be formidable,” Schecter said.  IBM also uses its patents to affect trends in technology:
If it wishes to promote certain standards, it may tell other
companies it won’t sue anyone innovating in that area even if
its patents are infringed. So far, the strategy has attracted
clients for consulting on intellectual property management and
requests to testify before Congress, Schecter said.  Asian Surge  Still, IBM’s reign may be threatened in coming years by
Asian rivals, IFI said. Samsung’s 8 percent growth in patents
outpaced IBM’s 5 percent, and in the number of patent
applications Samsung has eclipsed IBM for two years, the
researcher said. Patent applications are an indication of future
patent grants, IFI said.  “IBM seems to have a successful strategy that keeps them in
a very prominent position,” Mike Baycroft, IFI chief executive
officer, said in an interview. “It may not last. As the Asians
file more and more, especially large companies like Samsung,
there is a possibility that they will take over that No. 1
position.”  Samsung, based in Suwon,  South Korea , gained 4,894 patents
last year, while Canon won 2,821. Microsoft dropped to sixth
place in the rankings, while Intel fell to 16th from eighth.
There were eight Asian and two U.S. companies in the top 10.  In all, the U.S. issued a record 224,505 patents in 2011,
up 2 percent from 2010, Madison, Connecticut-based IFI said.  Perforating Machine  Patents are part of IBM Chief Executive Officer Virginia “Ginni” Rometty’s strategy as the company seeks to expand in
areas such as  emerging markets , cloud computing and analytics.
Rometty, the first woman at the helm in IBM’s 100-year history,
took over from Sam Palmisano Jan. 1 and tries to meet a goal of
adding $20 billion in new revenue between 2010 and 2015.
Analysts on average  estimate  IBM will report $107.2 billion in
sales for 2011.  The company invests about $6 billion in research and
development each year, and makes about $1 billion in licensing
revenue, said Chris Andrews, a spokesman. IBM has a 250-person
team managing its patents, and it provides training for more
than 8,000 inventors. They record about 20,000 breakthroughs
annually, and only some are submitted for patents.  IBM  rose  0.6 percent to $182.32 at the close in  New York .
The stock reached a record in 2011 and advanced 25 percent for
the year.  IBM won its first patent for a perforating machine on July
25, 1911. Since then, the company’s inventors have received more
than 70,000 patents, 34,000 of which are active, Andrews said.
The company patented DRAM cells, which became the standard for
computer memory, in 1968. There are also non-computer
inventions, like a laser technique that went on to become the
foundation for LASIK eye surgery.  * The Top 10 U.S. Patent Winners of 2011:
