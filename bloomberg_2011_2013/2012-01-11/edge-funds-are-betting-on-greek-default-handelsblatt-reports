Some  hedge funds  won’t accept a plan
to cut Greek debt as they are betting that the country will
default,  Handelsblatt reported , without saying where it got the
information.  Hedge funds have bought Greek bonds as well as bad-debt
insurance in the form of credit default swaps and therefore have
no interest in the country’s rescue, the German newspaper said.  Should more than 50 percent of creditors take part in the
debt reduction agreement, it would be pleasing, an unidentified
banker familiar with negotiations said, according to
Handelsblatt. In contrast, European Union officials expect a
participation rate of not much lower than 100 percent, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
