Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  chief  Peter Voser  said the potential for shale gas development in Europe is
limited by the region’s regulations and its dense population.  Shell expects expansion in shale and tight gas -- which is
locked in rock that’s difficult and expensive to break -- in
 North America , China and Australia, and has signed a deal in
Ukraine, the chief executive officer said in an interview in
 Shell Venster , the company’s Dutch-language personnel magazine.  “We are looking further at possibilities in Europe, but
the development of shale gas there will be limited as a result
of regulation, legislation, high population density and the
challenge of obtaining permits,” he said in the interview.  Shell, based in  The Hague , applied for permits to drill for
oil in Arctic regions this year and next, he said. “We have all
the permits we need but we have a long way to go before we start
drilling. The emphasis is on Alaska and to a certain extent
Greenland, and in Russia some possibilities may arise.”  The company said in September it agreed to invest as much
as $800 million to explore for oil, natural gas and shale gas in
Ukraine. Shell will cooperate with Ukraine’s  Ukrgasvydobuvannia 
to explore six license areas covering about 1,300 square
kilometers (500 square miles) in the Kharkiv region. Drilling of
the first deep exploration well would begin this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
