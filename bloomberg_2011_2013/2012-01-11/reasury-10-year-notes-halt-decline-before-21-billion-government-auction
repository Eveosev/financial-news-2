Treasuries increased as  Fitch
Ratings  said the  European Central Bank  should step up government
bond purchases to combat the euro region’s debt crisis,
encouraging demand for a U.S. refuge.  America’s debt securities advanced before the $21 billion
auction of 10-year notes as stock-index futures dropped and
yesterday’s three-year offering produced the highest demand
ever. A  gauge  of inflation expectations over the next 10 years
fell to a one-week low.  “The primary  market sentiment  is still very positive,”
said  Kornelius Purps , a fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA
in Munich. “Yesterday’s auction went very well. The Fitch
comments had a little bit of an impact.”  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes fell three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.94 percent at 8:23 a.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
securities due in November 2021 rose 9/32, or $2.81 per $1,000
face amount, to 100 17/32.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  decreased 0.6 percent, while
futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in March
decreased 0.3 percent.  The ECB needs to be more “actively engaged,”  David Riley ,
head of the sovereign-debt unit at Fitch, said at an event in
 Frankfurt  today.  Demand for Treasuries as a haven has pushed debt due in 10
years or longer up 28 percent in the past 12 months, the most
among 144 government-bond indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Ten-year
yields fell more than 140 basis points in 2011 as Europe’s debt
crisis intensified.  German Economy  Germany ’s economy shrank “roughly” 0.25 percent in the
fourth quarter, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said
today in an unofficial estimate.  Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President  Sandra Pianalto 
said the economic recovery faces “headwinds” such as
“depressed” housing markets, the sovereign-debt crisis in
 Europe  and government spending cuts.  “Despite our current accommodative monetary policy, the
recovery from the recent financial and economic crisis has been
frustratingly slow,” Pianalto said in Wooster,  Ohio . “Going
forward, I will continue to weigh the costs and benefits of
further policy actions.”  Break-Even Rate  The spread between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, known as the break-even rate,
narrowed to 2.06 percentage points. The spread earlier shrank to
2.05 percentage points, the smallest since Jan. 4.  The Fed is replacing $400 billion of shorter-maturity
Treasuries in its holdings with longer-term debt to cap
borrowing costs under a plan announced in September. The central
bank is  scheduled  to buy as much as $2.75 billion of Treasuries
maturing from February 2036 to November 2041 as part of the
program today.  U.S.  unemployment  unexpectedly fell in December to 8.5
percent, the least since February 2009, the Labor Department
said last week. Manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in
six months, another report showed.  Sales at U.S.  retailers  probably rose in December,
economists said before a report tomorrow. The projected 0.3
percent gain in purchases would follow a 0.2 percent advance in
November, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey before Commerce Department figures.  Yield Outlook  The U.S. 10-year yield will climb to 2.63 percent by year-
end, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of financial companies, with the most recent forecasts
given the heaviest weightings.  The Treasury’s $32 billion three-year note sale yesterday
drew  bids  for 3.73 times the amount offered, the most since at
least 1993.  The 10-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 1.96
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with the all-time low
of 2 percent in the Sept. 13 auction. Investors bid for 3.53
times the amount of debt offered last month, the most since
April 2010.  The government is scheduled to conclude this week’s supply
with a $13 billion sale of 30-year bonds tomorrow. It will
announce tomorrow that it will auction $14 billion of 10-year
inflation-protected securities on Jan. 19, according to
Wrightson ICAP LLC, an economic advisory company in  Jersey City ,
 New Jersey , that specializes in  government finance .  To contact the reporters on this story:
