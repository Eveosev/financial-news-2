The U.S. Supreme Court rejected
calls for judges to assess the reliability of eyewitnesses
before letting them go before a jury to identify the culprit in
a criminal case.  The justices, voting 8-1, ruled against a  New Hampshire (BEESNH)  man
who was arrested for breaking into a car after a witness
identified him. The accused man, Barion Perry, contended the
identification wasn’t reliable because he was standing next to a
police officer when the witness saw him from her apartment
window.  In ruling against Perry, the justices said they wouldn’t
extend a constitutional rule that protects suspects against
witness identifications that are influenced by police
suggestions. Writing for the court, Justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
said that rule applies only in cases involving law-enforcement
misconduct.  “The jury, not the judge, traditionally determines the
reliability of evidence,” Ginsburg wrote.  Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the lone dissenter.  The case is Perry v. New Hampshire, 10-8974.  To contact the reporter on this story:
