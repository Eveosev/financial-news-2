Mexico ’s peso pared earlier declines
after the nation’s  auto industry  group said production hit a
record last year, fueling optimism for Latin America’s second-
biggest economy.  The peso dropped 0.1 percent to 13.6406 per  U.S. dollar  at
1:37 p.m. in Mexico City, from 13.6329 yesterday. The currency
weakened as much as 0.5 percent in intraday trading. It’s gained
2.2 percent in 2012, after posting the worst performance among
Latin America’s major currencies last year  The peso, which earlier fell amid concern a German economic
slump would damp global growth, pared losses after Mexico’s
Automobile Industry Association said auto production last month
outpaced that of December 2010, according to  Eduardo Suarez , a
 Latin America  currency strategist at Scotia Capital Inc. Output
hit a record in 2011, Eduardo Solis, president of the auto
association known as AMIA, said during an event in Mexico City.  Production of cars and light trucks rose to 2.56 million
units last year, a 13.1 percent increase from 2010, he said.  “The correlation with the auto industry and the economy as
a whole is really high,” Suarez said in a telephone interview
from Toronto.  Mexico’s industrial production rose 3.2 percent in November
from a year earlier, the national statistics agency said today
on its website. Economists had forecast an increase of 3.6
percent, according to the median estimate of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The yield on Mexico’s benchmark peso-denominated bond due
in 2024 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
6.58 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
of the security fell 0.31 centavo to 129.65 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
