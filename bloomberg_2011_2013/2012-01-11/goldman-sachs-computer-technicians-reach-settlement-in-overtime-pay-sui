Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  will pay
$993,841 to settle a suit brought by a group of computer
technicians who said they weren’t paid overtime for their work
as contractors.  The parties asked U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley in
Manhattan in a filing today to approve the settlement. Forty-one
technicians returned claim forms, according to the filing.  “The parties reached the settlement agreement after an
arm’s-length mediation held in March 2011,” according to the
filing.  In the lawsuit, the technicians said they deserved overtime
pay for working more than 40 hours a week. Work weeks topped 70
hours, and more than 100 employees in  New York  and New Jersey
were underpaid as a result, they said in the complaint filed in
May 2010.  David Wells , a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to comment
on the settlement.  The case is Bardouille v. Goldman Sachs & Co., 10-cv-4285,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
