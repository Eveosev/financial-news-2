Malaysia’s ringgit declined as data
today showed exports rose by less than economists forecast.
 Government bonds  fell.  Overseas sales climbed 8 percent from a year earlier in
November after a revised 15.4 percent gain the previous month,
the trade ministry said. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a 12.9 percent increase. Industrial production
advanced 1.8 percent in November from a year earlier, the least
since July, a government report showed yesterday, compared with
a median forecast for a 3.5 percent gain in a Bloomberg survey.  “Malaysia’s growth is likely to get slower,” said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja , a Singapore-based senior currency analyst at
Malayan Banking Bhd. “Global volatility is affecting the
movement of the ringgit.”  The ringgit fell 0.4 percent to 3.1450 per dollar as of
12:51 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency, which has gained 0.9 percent so far
this month, may drop to 3.19 by the end of March, Tanuwidjaja
predicted.  Italy faces a “significant chance” of a downgrade by
 Fitch Ratings ,  David Riley , head of the sovereign-debt unit at
the company, said yesterday. China’s imports rose 11.8 percent
in December from a year earlier, the slowest pace in 24 months,
official data showed yesterday.  The yield on the Malaysian government’s 3.434 percent bonds
due August 2014 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 3.04 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
