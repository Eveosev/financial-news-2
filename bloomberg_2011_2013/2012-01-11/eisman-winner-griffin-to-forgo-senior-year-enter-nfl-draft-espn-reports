Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III will forgo his senior year at Baylor University to enter
April’s National Football League draft,  ESPN reported , citing an
unidentified member of the quarterback’s family.  Griffin, 21, led the  Bears  to a 67-56 win over the
 University of Washington  in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 29 to secure
the second 10-win season in the 110-year history of Baylor’s
football program.  A former All-American hurdler, Griffin was the nation’s
top-rated passer during the regular season, completing 72
percent of his passes for 4,293 yards, 37 touchdowns and six
interceptions. He also rushed for 699 yards and 10 scores.  The deadline for underclassmen to declare for the draft is
Jan. 15.  The  Indianapolis Colts  are projected by analysts to take
Stanford University quarterback Andrew Luck with the first pick
in the draft.  The St. Louis Rams and  Minnesota Vikings  -- who have the
second and third picks -- took quarterbacks in the first round
of the draft over the past two years, making the  Cleveland
Browns , with the fourth overall pick, the favorites to draft
Griffin, according to online sports book Bovada. The Browns went
4-12 last season with Colt McCoy at quarterback.  To contact the reporter on this story:
