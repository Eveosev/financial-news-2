Russia swung to a  budget surplus  in
2011 after two years in deficit as spending was lower than
planned and oil prices exceeded estimates,  Vedomosti  said,
citing two unidentified  Finance Ministry  officials.  The budget surplus reached 414 billion rubles ($13
billion), or about 0.8 percent of gross domestic product, the
Moscow-based newspaper reported, citing preliminary data from
the Finance Ministry. The government initially expected a
deficit of 3.6 percent of GDP, according to Vedomosti.  To contact the reporter on this story:
