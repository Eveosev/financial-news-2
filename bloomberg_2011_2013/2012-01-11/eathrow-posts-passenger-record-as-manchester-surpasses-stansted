BAA Ltd.’s  London Heathrow airport ,
the busiest in  Europe , handled a record 69.4 million passengers
last year, pushing it to the limits of capacity constraints.  Passenger numbers at Heathrow rose 5.5 percent to exceed a
previous high of 67.9 million set in 2007 as the airport handled
476,197 flights, or 99.2 percent of its 480,000 limit, BAA said
today in a statement. The company’s Stansted base suffered a
traffic slump and fell below Manchester in the U.K. rankings.  BAA handled 105.8 million passengers across its six U.K.
airports last year, an increase of 4.4 percent, though adjusting
for disruption in 2010 from snow, volcanic ash and a strike at
British Airways the increase was 0.9 percent. Heathrow’s figures
are being spurred by business bookings to  emerging markets ,
helping to offset weaker domestic and short-haul leisure demand.  “ India ,  China  and  Brazil  in particular have been growing
really well,” BAA Commercial Director John Holland-Kaye said in
a telephone interview. “Given the way the world economy is
changing, the more routes we have to those markets the better
able we are to tap into those growing economies.”  London Stansted, previously Britain’s No. 3 airport after
Heathrow and  London Gatwick  -- which BAA sold in 2009 -- slipped
to fourth in the rankings following a 2.8 percent decline in
passenger numbers to 18 million.  That puts it behind  Manchester  in northern  England , where
the total rose 6.5 percent to 18.8 million, according to a
statement last week.  BAA’s Edinburgh airport, which the London-based company
aims to sell this year after an antitrust ruling, attracted 9.38
million passengers in 2011, an increase of 9.2 percent. Glasgow,
which it is keeping, posted a 5.1 percent gain to 6.86 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
