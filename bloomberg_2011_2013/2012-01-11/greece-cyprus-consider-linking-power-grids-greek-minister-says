Greece  and Cyprus may agree to link
the power grids of Crete, Greece’s largest island, and Cyprus to
raise security and increase supplies, the Greek energy minister
said.  “We will look into the financial and technical aspects of
linking Cyprus and Crete with the prospect of linking Crete with
continental Greece,”  George Papaconstantinou , Greece’s
environment, energy and climate change minister, said today in a
 statement  on the website of Cyprus’s Press and Information
Office. Papaconstantinou is on a visit to Cyprus.  State-owned power producer Electricity Authority of Cyprus
has been buying power from the Turkish Cypriot system daily
since a July 11 explosion damaged Cyprus’s largest power plant
and cut its producing capacity by half. The subsequent power
failures hurt the country’s economy, the euro area’s third-
smallest.  Cyprus, the east Mediterranean island state, is divided
between the self-declared Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus 
and the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus. The
territory was divided when  Turkey  invaded the northern third of
the island in 1974 after a coup, inspired by the military junta
then in power in Greece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
