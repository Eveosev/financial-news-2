Deutsche Bank AG (DB)  will list six
synthetic exchange-traded funds in Hong Kong tomorrow, according
to Chris Lee, head of global markets, investment products and
db-X Asia.  Five of the funds track, respectively, MSCI’s Indonesia,
Thailand, Malaysia, China and India indexes, Lee said at a press
briefing in the city.  Synthetic ETFs are investments that mimic the behavior of
exchange-traded funds through the use of derivatives such as
swaps.  The sixth fund reflects the performance of a daily rolled
deposit earning the  Reserve Bank  of Australia’s short-term money
market reference rate.  Marco Montanari, director and head of bank ETFs and db-X
funds for Asia, said today the bank consulted with the Hong Kong
regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission, for several
months before the products were authorized on Dec. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
