China’s gold imports from  Hong Kong 
surged to a record as consumers bought the metal before the
Lunar New Year this month and investors sought to hedge against
financial turmoil. Bullion rallied to a four-week high.  Mainland China bought 102,779 kilograms from Hong Kong in
November, up from 86,299 kilograms in October, according to the
 Census and Statistics Department  of the Hong Kong government.
China doesn’t publish gold trade data.  Demand for gold is climbing in China as investors seek to
protect their wealth against slumping property prices and equity
markets amid an inflation rate above 4 percent. The nation
overtook  India  in the third quarter as the largest gold jewelry
market, according to the World Gold Council. The country is also
the biggest producer. Bullion rose as much as 0.9 percent to
$1,647.45 an ounce today, the highest since Dec. 13.  “ China ’s appetite for gold is very strong and growing,”
said Tao Jinfeng, chief investment consultant at Haitong Futures
Co., China’s largest brokerage by registered capital. “The few
months before the Lunar New Year is typically the peak demand
period for Chinese people.” The weeklong holiday begins Jan. 23.  Imports were profitable as prices in Hong Kong mostly
traded at a discount to those in China in November. Gold for
immediate delivery of 99.99 percent purity on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange averaged 356.05 yuan a gram ($1,753 an ounce) in
November,  compared  with an average of 434.68 Hong Kong dollars
(353 yuan) at the Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange Society.  “There is always the possibility that some purchases were
made by the central bank,” said Tao, rated the fourth-best
China gold analyst in a Futures Daily and Securities Times poll.  Gold Reserves   The People’s Bank of China last made known its gold
reserves more than two years ago, announcing that it held 33.89
million ounces, or 1,054 tons, as of June 30, 2009. Officials at
the central bank weren’t immediately available to comment.  China’s holdings are the world’s fifth-largest by country,
according to World Gold Council data. Central banks and
government institutions bought 142 tons in 2010, International
Monetary Fund data show.  As incomes rise, Chinese investors are looking for
alternative investments as the Shanghai Composite Index tumbled
33 percent since 2009, making it the worst performer among the
world’s 15 biggest markets, while  home prices  fell for a fourth
month in December after curbs that included higher down-payment
and mortgage requirements. Per-capita disposable  income  for
households in towns and cities rose 14 percent to 16,301 yuan in
the first three quarters of 2011.  Gold climbed 10 percent last year, rallying for an 11th
year, as central banks joined investors in buying bullion to
diversify assets.  South Korea ,  Thailand ,  Turkey  and  Russia  were
among those who added gold to reserves in 2011.  Bullion for immediate-delivery in  London , which reached a
record $1,921.15 an ounce on Sept. 6, traded at $1,645.25 an
ounce by 5:32 p.m. Singapore time today.  --Glenys Sim and Feiwen Rong. Editor: James Poole  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
