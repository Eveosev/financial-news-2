Sri Lanka  was held to its lowest
one-day score in a 258-run loss to South Africa to open their
five-game cricket series.  Morne Morkel took 4-10 and Lonwabo Tsotsobe was 3-19 as Sri
Lanka was bowled out for 43 in reply to the host’s 301-8 in
Paarl.  Sri Lanka eclipsed its previous low score of 55 against the
West Indies in 1986. It also tied for the fourth-lowest score
ever, matching Pakistan’s total against the West Indies in 1993.  Hashim Amla scored 112 and  Jacques Kallis  added 72 as South
Africa finished 301-8, while Lasith Malinga took five wickets
for the visitors. The second game will be played in East London
in three days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
