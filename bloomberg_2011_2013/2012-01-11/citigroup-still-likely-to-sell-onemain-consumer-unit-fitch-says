Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, is likely to sell its consumer-finance unit
even as the lender postponed that effort until market conditions
improve, according to Fitch Ratings.  “Citigroup will continue its exploration of separation
opportunities once markets stabilize,” Fitch said today in a
statement.  The lender halted talks to sell the OneMain subsidiary,
previously known as CitiFinancial, after failing to reach
agreement with potential acquirers, a person familiar with the
matter said last week. The New York-based bank will continue to
seek buyers rather than keep the unit, Fitch said.  Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit, 54, tagged the unit
for sale after Citigroup received a $45 billion taxpayer
bailout. Interested buyers Centerbridge Capital Partners LLC,
 Leucadia National Corp. (LUK)  and Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) , mutually agreed to end negotiations, the person said.  Citigroup climbed 3.8 percent to $31.13 at 12:43 p.m. in
New York trading. The shares had dropped 39 percent in the past
year through yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
