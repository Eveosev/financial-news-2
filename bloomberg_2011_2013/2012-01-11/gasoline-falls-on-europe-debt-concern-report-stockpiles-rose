Gasoline fell as  Germany ’s economy
shrank, increasing concern the region will fall into recession,
and after a report that stockpiles rose last week.  Futures declined as  Europe ’s largest economy shrank
“roughly” 0.25 percent in the fourth quarter from the third,
the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. The
industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  said U.S. gasoline
supplies rose 1.89 million barrels last week.  “If the economy in Germany is slowing, that portends a
bleaker outlook for demand in Europe,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “And product
builds would be bearish.”  Gasoline for February delivery fell 0.91 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.7637 a gallon at 10:07 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , after touching $2.7542.  The European Union cut  euro-area growth  to 0.1 percent in
the third quarter, from 0.2 percent estimated earlier.  Europe’s
debt crisis may cost the U.S. as much as half a percentage point
in economic growth, Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius
said today at an event in Frankfurt.  U.S. gasoline inventories probably rose 2.25 million
barrels last week, according to the median estimate of 12
analysts in a survey by Bloomberg News. That would leave
supplies at the highest level in 10 months.  Distillate stockpiles increased 2.25 million barrels to
145.8 million, the highest in 11 weeks, the survey projected.
API reported that distillate inventories rose 846,000 barrels.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. today in  Washington .  February-delivery heating oil was unchanged at $3.1014 a
gallon on the exchange, after touching $3.0925.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, was
unchanged at $3.372 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
