Banco do Brasil SA may have to pay
out 3 billion reais ($1.7 billion) in crop insurance to drought-
stricken farmers in the south of the country, National
Integration Minister Fernando Bezerra said.  The drought in the states of Santa Catarina,  Rio Grande  do
Sul and Parana has hit producers of rice, soy and corn, Bezerra
said to reporters in Brasilia. The government will announce
measures to help farmers in the south on Jan. 13, Bezerra said.  Other regions of Brazil have been hit by heavy rains and
flooding in recent weeks. Floods and landslides in the states of
Rio de Janeiro,  Minas Gerais  and Espirito Santo have killed at
least 30 people and left more than 5,000 homeless.  To contact the reporter on this story:
