The large number of new requirements
on banks could lead to a credit crunch, Michael Meister, vice
chairman of  Chancellor Angela Merkel â€™s Christian Democratic
Union-led caucus in parliament, is cited as saying an interview
with Handelsblatt.  New rules such as  capital requirements  under Basel III and
stricter liquidity requirements could increase the cost of loans
for small and mid-sized borrowers, Meister said in the
interview, the newspaper reported in a preview of an article to
be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
