India ’s 10-year bond yields were
steady near a five-month low amid speculation debt purchases by
the central bank will spur demand.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will offer to buy 120 billion
rupees ($2.3 billion) of securities due in 2018, 2020, 2022 and
2032 on Jan. 13, it said in a statement yesterday. Bonds
reversed an earlier loss on optimism official data next week
will show  inflation  was the slowest in two years last month.  “The RBI’s open-market buying is a positive for bonds,”
said R.S. Chauhan, Mumbai-based chief dealer of treasury at
 State Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur. “Slowing inflation is also
spurring investors to add to holdings.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 was
little changed at 8.23 percent in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. It touched 8.20 percent on Jan.
9, the lowest level for benchmark 10-year rates since Aug. 10.  The wholesale-price  index  rose 7.68 percent in December,
less than the 9.11 percent pace in November, according to a
Bloomberg survey of economists before data due on Jan. 16.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
rose seven basis points to 7.86 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
