The Treasury sold $21 billion of 10-
year  notes  at a record low yield as speculation  France  may lose
its top  credit rating  amid Europe’s debt crisis bolstered the
refuge appeal of U.S. government securities.  The bonds drew a  yield  of 1.90 percent, compared with a
forecast of 1.928 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of nine of
the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers. The  bid-to-cover 
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the
amount of debt offered, was 3.29, versus an average of 3.11 for
the past 10 auctions. It was the second of three note and bond
auctions totaling $66 billion this week.  “ Risk aversion  continues to rule the day as the European
situation remains worrisome,” said  Suvrat Prakash , an interest-
rate strategist in  New York  at BNP Paribas SA, one of the
primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed. “That we are
auctioning this supply at such low yields is a good sign for
tomorrow’s auction, as investors seem to care more about safety
than return.”  The  yield  on the current 10-year note fell seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 1.90 percent at 3:48 p.m.
in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2
percent security due in November 2021 rose 19/32, or $5.94 per
$1,000, face amount, to 100 7/8.  Thirty-year bond  yields fell
six basis points to 2.96 percent.  Haven Demand  Demand for Treasuries as a haven has pushed debt due in 10
years or longer up 28 percent in the past 12 months, the most
among 144 government-bond indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Yields on 10-year notes fell more than 140 basis points in
2011 as  Europe ’s debt crisis intensified. The securities
returned 17 percent last year, outperforming the 9.8 percent
gain by the broader Treasury market, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The bid-to-cover ratio of 3.29 at today’s auction was the
lowest since 2.64 at the November 2011 offering. At the
Treasury’s last sale of the notes in December, the ratio was
3.53.  Indirect bidders, a group that includes foreign central
banks, bought 38.3 percent of the amount sold, compared with
61.9 percent in the prior auction. Primary dealers bought 44.3
percent, compared with 29.7 percent in the previous sale. Direct
bidders purchased 17.4 percent.  Last month’s offering of 10-year notes drew a yield of 2.02
percent, near the then-record low 2 percent yield at the
September sale.  ‘There’s a Need’  “There’s a need for the securities,”  Scott Graham , head
of government-bond trading in  Chicago  at Bank of Montreal’s BMO
Capital Markets Corp., a primary dealer, said before the
auction. “There’s a rumor that France has been given a 12-hour
notice for a downgrade.”  French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  denied having been
notified by a ratings company about a downgrade of France’s top
credit ranking.  The U.S. is due to auction $13 billion of 30-year debt
tomorrow, after selling $32 billion in three-year notes
yesterday at a record bid-to-cover ratio of 3.73. This week’s
auctions will raise $30.5 billion of new cash as $35.5 billion
of maturing securities are held by the public, according to
Treasury Department data.  “The Treasury is the one vehicle globally where you can
move billions into the marketplace very quickly, even though the
yield is not very attractive,” said  William Larkin , a fixed-
income money manager who helps oversee $500 million at Cabot
Money Management Inc. in Salem,  Massachusetts . “It’s the only
place a lot of capital can run to -- in and out.”  Low Volatility  Volatility in the Treasury market is near its lowest level
in almost seven months. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE
index (MOVE) , which measure price swings in Treasuries based on prices
of over-the-counter options maturing in two to 30 years, rose to
80.2 yesterday from the lowest point since June 13. The 2011
average was 94.1, with a high of 117.8 on Aug. 8 and a low of
71.5 on May 31.  Primary-dealer  holdings  of  government securities ,  including 
bills, coupon securities and inflation-indexed debt, increased
to the most since November 2010. The 21 primary dealers held
$74.7 billion of the securities as of Dec. 28. The firms held
$61.6 billion of  Treasury (.LTTSYS)  notes and bonds as of Dec. 28, a
record amount.  Treasuries held  in custody  at the Fed for foreign central
banks and other official investors dropped to $2.67 trillion at
the end of December from $2.73 trillion at the end of November,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Beige Book   The Fed purchased $2.25 billion in Treasuries today under
its program of replacing $400 billion of shorter maturities in
its holdings with longer-term debt to cap borrowing costs. It
bought $2.3 trillion of Treasury and mortgage-related bonds from
2008 through June in two rounds of quantitative easing to
support the economy.  The U.S. economic expansion improved last month across most
of the country while hiring was limited and housing remained
stagnant, the central bank said in its Beige Book anecdotal
business survey released today in  Washington .  The economy “expanded at a modest to moderate pace” from
late November through the end of December the Fed said. At the
same time, most industries saw “limited permanent hiring,” and
the housing market remained “sluggish.”  “The Beige Book suggests a recovery, while on questionable
footing, continues to make marginal progress toward
sustainability,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist
at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Instead,
the market is focusing on other risks facing the global recovery
-- namely, Europe.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
