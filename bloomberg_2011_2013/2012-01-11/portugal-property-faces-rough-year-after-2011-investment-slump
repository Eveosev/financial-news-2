Portugal ’s real-estate market
probably will show little improvement this year after investment
dropped by 66 percent in 2011, according to broker Cushman &
Wakefield Inc.  “We should see more of the same next year because it’s
difficult to obtain bank financing for real estate and there is
a perception of risk in the market,” said Eric van Leuven,
managing partner at the New York-based property company.  Real-estate spending in Portugal, which received a $78
billion-euro bailout last year, fell to 269 million euros ($341
million) in 2011 from 730 million euros the previous year, van
Leuven said at a presentation to reporters in Lisbon today.
Portugal’s economy is expected to contract by more than 3.1
percent this year, after falling by about 1.6 percent in 2011,
the Bank of Portugal said yesterday.  Fitch Ratings  and Moody’s
Investors Service both cut the country’s debt rating to below
investment grade last year.  A decision by the government to ease century-old rent
controls and the likelihood Portuguese banks will push harder to
sell repossessed properties in 2012 may push prices down,
creating a “good opportunity,” for investors, van Leuven said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
