Greece ’s finance ministry submitted
an omnibus bill on implementing structural reforms for the
period 2012 to 2015 as part of commitments made to secure a
second international financing package.  “This bill contains extremely pressing matters, the vast
majority of which are structural in nature and commitments by
our country which must be completed before the new loan
accord,” the ministry said in a release accompanying the bill
and posted on the parliament website.  Officials of the  European Commission,  European Central
Bank  and  International Monetary Fund , the so-called troika,
start talks next week in Athens on a 130 billion-euro ($166
billion) second financing package for Greece agreed in Brussels
last October. The deal includes a debt swap plan to reduce
Greece’s debt to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020.  The bill, part of Greece’s 2012 to 2015 medium-term fiscal
plan, is on reforms such as opening up professions, including
those of taxi drivers and lawyers, overhauling state media and
setting up a gambling market regulator.  A parliamentary committee is due to start debating the
omnibus bill, which also includes operational details for the
Hellenic Republic Asset Management Fund, on Jan. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
