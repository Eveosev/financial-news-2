OCI Solar Power , majority-owned by a
unit of South Korean polysilicon maker OCI Co., plans to build
400 megawatts of solar power projects for CPS Energy,  San
Antonio ’s municipal utility.  The proposal may be finalized within the next three months
and would include a 25-year power purchase agreement for
electricity generated by multiple projects, Doyle Beneby, chief
executive officer of CPS, said today on a conference call with
reporters. Project costs weren’t disclosed.  Construction is expected to begin next year, with the first
projects coming online in the second half of 2013 and the
remainder through 2016, said Kirk Milling, CEO of Atlanta-based
OCI Enterprises, the U.S. parent of OCI Solar.  OCI Solar plans to relocate its headquarters from Atlanta
to San Antonio. Nexolon Co., a South Korean manufacturer of
solar-panel components, also will establish its North American
headquarters in San Antonio and build new facilities to supply
the projects, CPS said today in a statement.  OCI Solar was formed in January 2011 following OCI’s
acquisition of solar-project developer CornerStone Power
Development LLC. The company is developing 20 other projects
totaling 150 megawatts of capacity in nine states and a Canadian
province, according to its  website . The company focuses on
ground- and roof-mounted projects ranging from 2 megawatts to 30
megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
