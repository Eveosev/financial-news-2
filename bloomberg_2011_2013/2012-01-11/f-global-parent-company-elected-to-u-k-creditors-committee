Clients and creditors of  MF Global
Holdings Ltd. (MF) ’s U.K. unit elected the failed broker’s U.S.
affiliate as one of five members of a committee representing
them in the U.K. bankruptcy procedure.  MF Global Inc., Peabody Coal Trade International Ltd., KIT
Finance Europe AS, BB Energy (Gulf) DMCC and Unipec Singapore
Pte., were selected at a meeting this week, KPMG LLP said on its
website.  The committee hasn’t been formally sworn in by KPMG, which
was appointed to supervise MF Global’s special administration in
the U.K.  MF Global Holdings Ltd. was the fifth-largest financial
company to file for bankruptcy when it sought protection on Oct.
31 in  New York  after making losing bets on European sovereign
debt.  MF Global’s U.S. affiliate is in a dispute with  KPMG  over
assets worth $700 million held by the London unit.  U.S. Trustee James Giddens wants the money returned to the
U.S. while KPMG says the assets, in the form of cash and
Treasury bills, don’t fit the definition of protected customer
funds under U.K. law.  KPMG administrator Richard Heis said clients and creditors
had voted “overwhelmingly” in favor of its plans for the
administration at the Jan. 9 meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
