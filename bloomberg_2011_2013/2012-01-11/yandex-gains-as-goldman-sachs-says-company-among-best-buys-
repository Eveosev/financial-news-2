Yandex NV (YNDX) , the operator of  Russia ’s
most popular Internet search engine, climbed after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. raised its recommendation on the stock to “buy”
from “neutral” and listed the company as one of the “best buy
ideas” in the European media and telecommunications industry.  Yandex gained 1.8 percent to $19.20 in New York, after
earlier jumping as much as 5.5 percent, the biggest intraday
advance since Dec. 22.  American depositary receipts of  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) ,
known as MTS, advanced 3.4 percent to $16.27, a five-week high,
after Goldman Sachs reiterated its “buy” recommendation on the
stock, also making it one of its “best buy ideas,” according
to an e-mailed report today.  Yandex is among companies that are “in the top quartile
among the European media companies as they benefit from exposure
to structural growth themes and economies that are expanding
faster,” Goldman analysts, including Moscow-based Alexander Balakhnin, Daria Fomina, Maxim Loginov and London-based Andrew Howard, said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
