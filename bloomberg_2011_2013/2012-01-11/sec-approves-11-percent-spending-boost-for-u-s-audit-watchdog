The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission approved a $227.7 million budget for the auditing
industry’s regulator, boosting its spending by 11 percent as it
takes on new duties overseeing broker-dealer audits.  SEC commissioners voted 5-0 for the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board’s 2012 spending plan today at a
meeting in Washington. The board, a nonprofit corporation
established by the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act  of 2002 to regulate and
inspect auditors of U.S.-listed firms, is funded by an
accounting fee on companies and registered broker-dealers.  “The PCAOB has grown into an important regulatory body
with a significant investor-protection role,” SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro  said before the vote. “To do its job -- and do it
right -- the PCAOB must have sufficient resources.”  Much of this year’s increase is attributed to a new
inspection program for auditors of broker-dealers established
under the Dodd-Frank financial-regulation overhaul. Brokers are
being assessed about $18 million for 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
