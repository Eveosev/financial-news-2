Bosnian Serb police arrested a man
suspected of bringing explosives and weapons into a sports hall
two days after Serbian President  Boris Tadic  attended a ceremony
at the site.  Anti-terrorist police units in Banja Luka, the capital of
the Serb entity in Bosnia-Herzergovina, found a detonator, a
sniper rifle and other firearms, a silencer and 400 bullets, B92
news portal reported, citing unidentified police officials.
Serbian police will send a team to help the investigation, the
portal said.  Tadic was in Banja Luka to attend the 20th anniversary of
the foundation of the Bosnian Serb Republic, one of two entities
in ethnically divided Bosnia. He leads the  Democratic Party ,
whose leader Zoran Djindjic, the first prime minister after the
fall of  Slobodan Milosevic , was assassinated in central Belgrade
in 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
