India ’s property investments by
 private-equity  firms rose 69 percent last year, according to
 Venture Intelligence , a research company that tracks private
equity, and mergers and acquisitions.  Private equity made $2.68 billion of real-estate
investments through 53 transactions in the country, Chennai,
India-based Venture Intelligence said in an e-mailed statement
late yesterday, based on deals that have been announced. In 2010,
they spent $1.58 billion on 55 investments, it said.  Indian developers are chasing private-equity funds because
of a liquidity squeeze after sales dried up, and banks and
finance companies cut funding. Private-equity deals are getting
transacted at internal rates of returns, or the yield of the
investment, of 25 percent to 30 percent, Amit Goenka, national
director of capital transactions at the Indian unit of London-
based Knight Frank LLP, said Sept. 15.  The largest investment last year was Jeff Morgan Capital
Ltd.’s $320 million in  Compact Disc India’s (CDI)  film city project.
Other major deals included Warburg Pincus LLC’s 14 billion rupee
($270 million) investment in a residential joint venture with
Lemon Tree Hotels and Blackstone Group LP’s $200 million
investment in Bangalore’s Manyata Embassy Business Park. Housing
projects accounted for 57 percent of the transactions, while
commercial projects made up 19 percent, the study showed.  A total of 69 private-equity investments were made in
India’s real-estate market in 2011, of which 53 were announced.
In the previous year, 55 of the 63 deals were publicly disclosed.  Divestments  Buyout firms made 19 exits last year. A total of 14 were
announced with a combined value of $603 million, Venture
Intelligence said, compared with eight in 2010, it said.  HDFC Property Ventures Ltd., which accounted for five of
the exits, sold its stake in the Embassy Property Developments
Ltd.’s information technology park in Bangalore in south India
back to the developer for 4.9 billion rupees in a deal funded by
Blackstone. HDFC also divested its two-year-old investment in
 Nitesh Estates Ltd.’s (NITE)  Bangalore mall project back to the
developer for 4.5 billion rupees.  Kotak Realty Fund realized $86 million from its stake sale
in Peepul Tree Properties Pvt., a commercial information
technology park in Mumbai, to Tata Realty Initiatives Fund.
Kotak also sold a 20-acre land parcel in the south Indian city
of Chennai that it had acquired from the Pentamedia Graphics
group in February 2007. Indiareit Fund Advisors Pvt. and Red
Fort Capital Advisors Pvt. also reported exits during the year,
Venture Intelligence said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
