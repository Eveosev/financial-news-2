Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM) ,
 Europe ’s second-largest wind-turbine maker, opened a turbine
blade-manufacturing plant in India as part of a plan to boost
production in the wind energy market.  The company, with about 30 factories worldwide, started
production at Vadodara in the western state of Gujarat after an
investment of 25 million euros ($32 million), it said today in a
statement. The facility, which created 157 jobs, will primarily
supply India’s northern states.  The factory is part of a 60 million-euro investment plan
announced by Zamudio, Spain-based Gamesa in March to strengthen
its manufacturing base in India to tap rising demand in the
country’s wind market. India now accounts for 20 percent of the
megawatts it sells around the world after almost tripling in a
year, it said.  Gamesa has been manufacturing in India since early 2010,
when it opened a facility to assemble nacelles. Last year, it
opened a wind tower factory in a joint venture and plans to
start another nacelle plant in  Tamil Nadu .  To contact the reporters on this story:
