Britain’s finance regulator charged
Richard Anthony Joseph with  insider trading  and  money laundering 
following his May, 2010, arrest for the crimes.  The Financial Services Authority said Joseph, 42, was
released on conditional bail after a hearing in London today. He
is scheduled to appear at a higher criminal court in March to
face the eight counts of insider trading and two counts of money
laundering, the regulator said in a  statement .  Joseph, who is not approved by the FSA to hold a regulated
position in Britain’s finance industry, faces as long as seven
years in jail for insider trading, plus a fine if he’s found
guilty.  The FSA, which prosecutes market abuse in the U.K., has at
least two insider trading trials scheduled to begin in the first
half of the year and another case awaiting a trial date.  Karen Roberts, a spokeswoman for Joseph’s law firm,  Irwin
Mitchell , didn’t immediately respond to a phone call or e-mail
seeking comment. FSA spokesman Christopher Hamilton declined to
comment further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
