Brokerage Exotix Ltd. will be
“winding down” its  Buenos Aires  office and transferring staff
to New York and London because of Argentine regulations,
Managing Director Peter Bartlett said.  The London-based brokerage that specializes in distressed
securities is transferring its staff because of the “regulatory
environment in Argentina,” Bartlett said in a telephone
interview from London, adding that “we can easily manage our
Argentine activities from elsewhere.”  President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  last month
approved anti-terrorism legislation that increases oversight of
financial markets, imposing prison sentences of as long as eight
years for “conduct that affects the economic and financial
order,” according to the law.  Barclays Plc also closed its wealth management office in
Buenos Aires on Jan. 6 “for strategic reasons,” the company
said in a statement. It will serve Latin American customers from
 New York  and Miami.  To contact the reporter on this story:
