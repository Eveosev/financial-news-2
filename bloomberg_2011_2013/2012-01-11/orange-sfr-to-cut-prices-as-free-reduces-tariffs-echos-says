France’s three established cell
phone companies are planning to cut prices after a new arrival,
Iliad SA’s Free, yesterday offered unlimited service for 19.99
euros ($26) a month,  Les Echos  reported, citing people at the
companies involved.  Similar unlimited service costs between 78 and 85 euros at
France Telecom SA’s Orange SA,  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s SFR, and Bouygues
Telecom, the morning financial newspaper said.  Some executives at the legacy companies doubt that Free can
make a profit at the prices it’s offering, Les Echos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
