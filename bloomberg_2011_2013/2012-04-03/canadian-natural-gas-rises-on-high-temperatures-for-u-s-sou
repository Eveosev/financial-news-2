Canadian natural gas rose as U.S.
nuclear generation climbed from near a 10-month low and cooling
demand approached double normal levels in parts of the South.  Alberta  gas gained 2.8 percent after U.S. reactor output
advanced 364 megawatts to 78,774, up from the lowest level since
May 24, according to filings with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and data compiled by Bloomberg.  Markets are responding to a “compounded effect” of
“cooling demand and spring nuclear maintenance season in the
U.S., which puts more onus on natural gas,” Eric Bickel, a
natural gas analyst at Summit Energy Services in Louisville,
Kentucky, said in a telephone interview.  Alberta gas for May delivery rose 4.75 cents to C$1.75 a
gigajoule ($1.68 per million British thermal units) as of 4:15
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is down 34 percent this year.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 3.5 cents to settle at $2.187 per million Btu.  The high temperature in Atlanta today may be 85 degrees
Fahrenheit (29 Celsius), 15 above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania. Demand for
cooling may be 91 percent above normal in the south-central
U.S., said Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri .  Spot Market  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near  Chicago  gained
12.43 cents, or 6.3 percent, to $2.1051 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas rose 10.46 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $1.9751 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, gas advanced 10.45 cents to $2.042.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.7 billion cubic
feet.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.51 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.9 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 838 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.82 billion cubic feet today, or 68 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.1
billion cubic feet at 2:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
