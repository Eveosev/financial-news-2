Bahrain’s Chamber of Commerce and
Industry said that persistent unrest may have “catastrophic
effects” on the nation’s economy and warned that investors may
pull out if it doesn’t abate, Gulf Daily News said.  The chamber said businesses, especially small and medium
enterprises and family-run businesses, have suffered major
losses in the past few months, the newspaper reported, citing a
statement issued by the chamber. Tensions have simmered in the
island nation since the Sunni monarchy cracked down on one month
of mass rallies last year by mostly Shiite demonstrators
demanding democracy and equal rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
