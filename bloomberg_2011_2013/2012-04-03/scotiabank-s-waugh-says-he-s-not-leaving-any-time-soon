Bank of Nova Scotia  Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Waugh , who turns 65 in December, said he’s not
intending to leave the job anytime soon.  Waugh spoke in an interview from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan,
where Scotiabank held its annual meeting of shareholders today.
He said he plans to be head of Canada’s third-largest bank by
assets at next year’s shareholder meeting.  “God willing and board willing,” Waugh said. “I serve at
the pleasure of both.” He declined to say when he plans to step
down.  Waugh has been with Scotiabank since 1970, beginning at a
branch in his native Winnipeg. He became CEO of the Toronto-
based lender in 2003 and has spent more than C$3.5 billion over
the past five years on acquisitions outside of  Canada , including
purchases in Colombia, Peru and  China .  Toronto-Dominion Bank’s  Edmund Clark , 64, said last week
that he is in his “final years” as CEO. Toronto-Dominion is
Canada’s second-largest bank, behind Royal Bank of Canada.  Waugh said succession planning has been taking place since
he took the top spot.  “We’re in regular discussions with the board on that,”
said Waugh. “And we’ve got great depth and breadth of
choices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
