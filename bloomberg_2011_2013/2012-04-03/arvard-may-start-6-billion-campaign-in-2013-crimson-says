Harvard University , the world’s
richest institution of higher learning, may begin a campaign
next year to raise more than $6 billion, a record for the
school, the Harvard Crimson reported today.  The university, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is
“considering a late 2013 launch” for the public phase of its
campaign, Tamara Rogers, vice president for alumni affairs and
development, said in an e-mailed statement. The university
hasn’t decided on the timing or fundraising goal, she said.  The Crimson cited senior administrators as its sources for
the $6 billion fundraising target.  Harvard’s last capital drive concluded in 1999 after
raising $2.6 billion. Since then, U.S. university fundraising
has grown in size and ambition, with  Yale University  amassing
$3.88 billion in a five-year campaign that ended in June and
Stanford University saying in December it raised $6.2 billion.
The University of  Southern California  kicked off its own $6
billion campaign in September.  This will be the first campaign headed by Harvard President
Drew Faust, who took office in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
