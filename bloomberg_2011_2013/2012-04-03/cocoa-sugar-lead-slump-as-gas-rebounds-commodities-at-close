The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 0.2 percent to 698.74 at 5:12 p.m. in
 London . The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials was

most, at 1.1 percent, and cocoa was down the most, at 2 percent.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn rose, heading for the biggest three-session rally

top exporter. Soybeans gained to a six-month high.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 1.2 percent to $6.63 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. A close at that price

May.  Soybean futures for May delivery climbed 0.4 percent to
$14.27 a bushel. Earlier, the price reached $14.3425, the

Index of 24 commodities.  U.K. natural gas for May was little changed amid ample
supplies of the heating fuel and lower-than-normal demand even

broker data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s equal to $9.57 a
million British thermal units. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  U.K. natural gas: NI NUKMKT
