Russian  equity futures  rose and coal
company  OAO Mechel (MTL)  climbed the most in five weeks in New York as
signs Chinese and U.S. manufacturing is expanding bolstered the
outlook for commodities.  Mechel,  Russia ’s biggest producer of steelmaking coal,
surged the most since Feb. 24 yesterday, while  OAO GMK Norilsk
Nickel (NILSY) , the world’s largest nickel producer, rose the most in a
week. The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of Russian companies
traded in New York jumped to the highest since March 27, while
futures expiring in June on Russia’s dollar-denominated RTS
Index advanced 1 percent to 161,285 in U.S. trading.  Manufacturing in the U.S. expanded at a faster pace than
economists anticipated in March, government data released
yesterday showed, while  China ’s Institute for Supply
Management’s factory  index  reached a one-year high last month.
 Mechel (MTLR)  drew a combined 14 percent of its revenue from Asia and
the U.S. in 2010, up from 3.7 percent three years earlier, while
Asia and  North America  are Norilsk’s second- and third-biggest
markets, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “This data is encouraging, it suggests that China isn’t
slowing, the U.S. recovery is clear,” James Fenkner, managing
director at Russian equity investment fund Red Star Asset
Management, which doesn’t hold Mechel or Norilsk shares, said by
phone yesterday in New York. “If China stops buying
commodities, then it hurts the economies like Russia that
produce commodities. The U.S. has been in a gradual recovery for
months now and that supports demand for commodities.”  Steel to Benefit  American depositary receipts of Mechel rallied 5.9 percent
to $9.51 yesterday, the biggest one-day gain since Feb. 24. The
jump widened the premium over the company’s Moscow-traded shares
to 3.6 percent, the widest since Feb. 3. The stock rose 5.6
percent in the first quarter, the best gain since the last three
months of 2010. Shares added 0.1 percent to 268.80 rubles, or
$9.18, in Moscow yesterday.  “Everyone is closely watching the developments in the
Chinese economy to determine the demand for steel, raw materials
and oil,”  Bruce Bower , a portfolio manager at Verno Capital in
Moscow, which manages $200 million, said by phone yesterday.
“Steel companies will benefit.”  ADRs of Norilsk, Russia’s biggest mining company, added 0.6
percent to $18.46 in the U.S. yesterday, the biggest jump since
March 26. The advance extended Norilsk’s 20 percent climb in the
first quarter, the biggest quarterly increase since the last
three months of 2010.  Norilsk got 22 percent of its revenue from  Asia  in 2010, up
from 17 percent in 2008,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  Copper Soars  Shares of  Norilsk (GMKN)  were little changed at 5,398 rubles, or
the equivalent of $184.33, on Moscow’s Micex Index yesterday.
The ADRs traded at a 0.1 percent premium to the Moscow shares.
One ADR is equal to one-tenth of an ordinary share.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI index  of 24 raw materials
climbed 1.7 percent to 700.40 yesterday, the biggest one-day
advance since Jan. 3. Copper rose the most in more than five
weeks, and aluminum, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc gained in
 London .  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, gained 1.1 percent to $31.20 yesterday,
the highest level since March 27. The  RTS Volatility Index (RTSVX) ,
which measures expected swings in the index futures, dropped 3.2
percent to 31.26.  The Bloomberg Russia-US measure added 0.8 percent to 108.10
yesterday.  OAO Rostelecom (ROSYY) , Russia’s biggest fixed-line telephone
company, added 2.4 percent to $29.89 in New York, trading at a
0.5 percent  premium  to its Micex-listed shares, the most since
March 26. Rostelecom gained 0.3 percent to 145.09 rubles, or
$4.95, in Moscow yesterday. Each ADR is equal to six ordinary
shares.  Rostelecom Merger  Moscow-based Rostelecom -- the second-best performer on the
Bloomberg Russia-US gauge yesterday after Mechel -- has started
the second stage of reorganization necessary for its merger with
state-controlled phone company OAO Svyazinvest, according to a
statement yesterday.  Russia’s government will hold more than 50 percent of the
new company and is considering selling stock in Rostelecom after
merging it with Svyazinvest, Alexei Uvarov, the head of the
 Economy Ministry ’s property department, said in June last year.  Crude oil for May delivery climbed 2.1 percent to $105.23 a
barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange yesterday. Crude,
Russia’s biggest export earner, gained 4.2 percent in the first
