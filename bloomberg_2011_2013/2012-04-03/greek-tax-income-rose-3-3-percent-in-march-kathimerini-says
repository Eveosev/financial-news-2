Greece â€™s tax revenue increased 3.3
percent to 3.5 billion euros ($4.7 billion) from the same month
a year earlier,  Kathimerini  reported, without saying where it
got the information.  The increased figure, which excludes tax refunds, was aided
by people settling tax arrears and a 2 percent rise in sales tax
revenue, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
