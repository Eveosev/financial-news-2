The owner of the unfinished
Federation Tower skyscraper in Moscow said it’s investigating
damage caused by a fire to see if it will delay construction.  “We’ve taken a time out to see if this affects our
construction schedule,” Yulia Brazhentseva, a spokeswoman for
Potok8, said by phone today.  Two fire-fighting helicopters were deployed to help
extinguish yesterday’s fire on the tower’s 66th and 67th floors.
The blaze broke out about 8 p.m. in Moscow after wind blew a
protective banner onto a light projector, the developer said.  The tower, which was originally planned to be  Europe ’s
tallest, was built with concrete that can withstand a fire for
as long as four hours, Potok8 said in an e-mailed statement.
“The building frame itself wasn’t damaged by the fire,” it
said. The blaze was put out four hours after it started, at
about midnight, the Interfax news agency reported.  There were no injuries from the fire, which affected about
300 square meters (3,200 square feet), according to a  statement 
on the Emergency Ministry’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
