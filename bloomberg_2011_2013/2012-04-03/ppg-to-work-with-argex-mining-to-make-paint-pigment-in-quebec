PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) , the world’s
second-largest paint maker, will work with  Argex Mining Inc. (RGX)  to
make titanium dioxide amid rising prices for the white pigment.  The technical collaboration agreement may lead to a new
supply of titanium dioxide for PPG, the Pittsburgh-based company
said in a statement today. Production of 15,000 metric tons a
year in  Quebec  is expected to begin in 18 to 36 months, rising
to 195,000 metric tons in 5 years, Jean-Francois Meilleur, a
spokesman for Montreal-based Argex, said in a telephone
interview.  PPG Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Charles Bunch is
developing methods to use less titanium dioxide, known by the
chemical formula TiO2, while buying cheaper pigment from  China 
as  prices  rose 45 percent in the last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Argex plans to spend C$800 ($807) million
on pigment factories through 2017, Meilleur said.  “This strategic initiative offers PPG the opportunity to
leverage our expertise and secure an enhanced supply of this
critical raw material,” Charles F. Kahle II, PPG chief
technology officer, said in the statement. “Volatile pricing
for titanium dioxide continues to be an important issue for the
company.”  Argex may also sell the chemical to battery makers, said
Meilleur, president of Montreal-based Paradox Public Relations.  PPG used to make TiO2 at its site in Natrium,  West
Virginia , according to the statement. Jeremy Neuhart, a PPG
spokesman, didn’t return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
