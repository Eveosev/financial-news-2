UT Bank Ltd. (UTB) , a lender in  Ghana ,
expects profit to rise by 70 percent this year after it uses an
investment by the International Finance Corp. to boost lending
to oil and construction companies.  “We are quite expectant of 2012,” Chief Executive Officer  Prince Kofi Amoabeng said in an interview in Accra, the
capital, yesterday. “With additional funds coming in we will do
more loans, which should translate into better profits.”  Lenders in Ghana have been seeking ways to raise cash to
meet a central bank capitalization requirement of 60 million
cedis ($34 million) by the end of the year. On March 30, UT Bank
said the  World Bank ’s lending branch, the IFC, would invest $15
million. Amoabeng said they will get shares worth about 20
percent of the company in return.  “With more funding coming in, we will also support more
cocoa buyers, expand on commerce, fishing and housing,” he
said. Ghana is the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer and
started production of crude oil for export in December 2010,
propelling economic growth to 13.6 percent last year. Expansion
of 9.4 percent is projected for this year, according to the
 Finance Ministry .  UT Bank’s net income rose to 13.1 million cedis in 2011
from 9.3 million cedis the previous year, the company said
yesterday. Loans and advances rose 51 percent to 475 million
cedis, it said. The stock was unchanged at 31 pesewas by 12:30
p.m. in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
