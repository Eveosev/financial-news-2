Boston Red Sox  relief pitcher  Andrew Bailey  has been told he needs thumb surgery, according to the
Boston Globe.  Bailey, the closer who is slated to replace Jonathan Papelbon as the Red Sox’s closer, will get a second opinion from
hand specialist Robert Graham at the Cleveland Clinic and may
have an operation today, the  newspaper reported , citing
unidentified people in Major League Baseball.  The 27-year-old Bailey pitched for the Oakland Athletics
last season before joining Boston in a December trade. He
strained his forearm a year ago during spring training and was
out until May 29. An All-Star the previous two seasons, Bailey
had 24 saves and a 3.24 earned run average in 2011.  Bailey’s spot in the bullpen may be filled by Mark Melancon, who had 20 saves for the Houston Astros last season,
and Alfredo Aceves, who has four career saves.  Joining Bailey in the visit to the Cleveland doctor’s
office will be  Red Sox  starter  Josh Beckett ,  Fox Sports
reported , citing unidentified people in the major leagues.  Beckett, who also has a thumb injury, is scheduled to start
Boston’s second game of the season on April 7, though the team
wants him to get a second opinion on his injury for “peace of
mind,” the people told Fox Sports. Beckett was in San Antonio
yesterday to have the thumb examined, and the exact nature of
the injury hasn’t been disclosed.  The 31-year-old Beckett is a three-time All-Star. He went
13-7 with a 2.89 ERA last season and didn’t miss a start this
spring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
