Italian Development Minister  Corrado Passera  denied a Financial Times report that Italy may need
further budget adjustments to reach its fiscal targets.  Italy doesn’t need new austerity measures, Passera told
reporters in Rome today, saying “there can’t be growth with
austerity.”  The European Commission said today Italy has taken
“decisive” steps to bring down its debt and spur growth.  “The Italian authorities have taken decisive action both
in terms of fiscal consolidation, putting the very high debt on
a declining path, and they’re taking decisive structural reform
to boost the growth potential of the Italian economy,”
commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said in Brussels.  Prime Minister  Mario Monti  is implementing a 20 billion-
euro ($26.7 billion) package of spending cuts and tax increases
to eliminate the deficit next year and trim the nation’s 1.9
trillion-euro debt. Those measures are weighing on growth, with
the European Commission forecasting on Feb. 23 a contraction of
1.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
