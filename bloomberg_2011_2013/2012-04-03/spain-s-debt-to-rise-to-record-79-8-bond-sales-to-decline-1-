Spain’s public debt will rise to a
record this year as it sells almost 37 billion euros ($49
billion) of bonds to finance a  budget deficit  that was nearly
three times the euro-area limit last year.  Total borrowing will reach 79.8 percent of gross domestic
product as the country breaches the European Union’s deficit
rules for a fifth year. That’s the highest since before the
country’s return to democracy in 1978 and up from 68.5 percent
last year, according to the 2012 budget that the government
presented to Parliament today in Madrid.  Net debt issuance will fall from 48.2 billion euros last
year as the government trims its budget deficit to 5.3 percent
of GDP from 8.5 percent in 2011, according to the plan.  Lawmakers began reviewing Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s
blueprint, which contains the deepest reductions in more than 30
years. The budget may fail to meet its goal of cutting the
deficit by more than one-third as its 27 billion euros of
spending cuts and tax increases will worsen  Spain ’s second
recession since 2009, economists including Barclays Capital
Antonio Garcia Pascual forecast.  “Achieving the 2012 deficit target of 5.3 percent of GDP
will remain very challenging,” Garcia Pascual, chief southern
European economist at Barclays, wrote in a note yesterday.  Bonds Slide  The yield on Spain’s 10-year bonds rose 6 basis point to
5.41 percent today and has gained more than 50 basis points
since March 2 when Rajoy raised the deficit target, citing a
deepening recession and his Socialist predecessor’s failures.
Rajoy is seeking to meet the EU’s 3 percent deficit ceiling next
year.  “The government will not hesitate to take measures to
comply with its deficit targets,” Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro told reporters. The goal is “unconditional” and the
government has the tools to make regional governments comply,
Montoro said.  The budget is based on bond yields at current levels,
Montoro told reporters. Budget documents forecast Spanish bond
yields in 2012 will remain near the levels of February, when the
yield on the country’s 10-year bond averaged 5.12 percent.  The Treasury faces redemptions of 149.3 billion euros in
2012, making for gross issuance of 186.1 billion euros,
according to budget documents. The government plans to reduce
the use of Treasury bills and increase the sale of longer-term
debt. The shift won’t be enough to boost average maturity, which
will fall to 6.2 years from 6.4 years.  Interest Payments  The government expects interest payments on the debt of
2.71 percent of GDP on a cash basis, or 28.8 billion euros this
year, according to the budget. That compares with 22 billion
euros that were spent last year, said Marta Fernandez Curras,
deputy minister for the budget.  The budget plan cuts spending by government ministries by
17 percent and seeks to raise revenue through ending some
corporate breaks and offering a one-time amnesty on  tax evasion .
Those tax measures are in place since March 31, as is the 15
billion-euro package of spending cuts and tax raises approved by
the one-month-old government in December and then included in
the budget.  Corporate-tax revenue is forecast to rise 17.8 percent this
year, while income-tax receipts will grow 4.7 percent due to
increases imposed in December, according to the documents.  The economy is forecast to shrink 1.7 percent this year,
following a 0.7 percent expansion last year and a contraction of
0.1 percent in 2010.  “We continue to forecast a 6.6 percent budget deficit for
2012,” Citigroup Global Markets senior economist Guillaume Menuet wrote in a note yesterday. “Implementing necessary
efforts designed to lift the economy’s potential growth rate
will likely have negative short-term consequences on activity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
