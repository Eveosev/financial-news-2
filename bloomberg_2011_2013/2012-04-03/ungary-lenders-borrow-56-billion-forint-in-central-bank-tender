Hungarian domestic banks borrowed 56
billion forint ($255 million) in the central bank’s first tender
of two-year collateralized loans, the  Magyar Nemzeti Bank  said
today.  The central bank, which announced the new credit facility
in February to prop up corporate lending, accepted all bids at
the tender, according to data  published  on the bank’s website.  Interest on the loans is equal to the benchmark  interest
rate  prevailing during their term and banks that keep from
reducing their adjusted outstanding loans to corporations to
below December 2011 levels during the term of the two-year loan
are eligible to bid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
