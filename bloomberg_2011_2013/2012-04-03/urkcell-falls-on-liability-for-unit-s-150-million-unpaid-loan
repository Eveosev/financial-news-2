Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL) ,
Turkey’s largest mobile-phone company, fell for a fifth day
after saying a majority-owned unit failed to pay a $150 million
loan, leaving Turkcell liable as the sole guarantor.  The shares fell 0.9 percent to 8.96 liras at 10:30 a.m. in
Istanbul.  Euroasia Telecommunications Holdings BV, in which Turkcell
owns a 55 percent stake, was unable to pay the loan when it came
due on March 30. Turkcell will have to pay by April 6, it said
in a statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  after the market
close yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
