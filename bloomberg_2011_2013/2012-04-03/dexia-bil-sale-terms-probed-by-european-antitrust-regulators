European Union regulators will probe
Luxembourg’s sale of Dexia Banque Internationale a Luxembourg SA
and will investigate a Belgian state guarantee for the
cooperatives of  Dexia SA (DEXB)  shareholder Groep Arco.  The European Commission opened in-depth investigations to
check that the sale of Dexia BIL by the Luxembourg government
“is conducted on market conditions” and that a Belgian deposit
guarantee program for financial cooperatives such as Arco didn’t
give those organizations an unfair advantage over other
investors, according to an e-mailed statement today.  Luxembourg plans to sell 90 percent of Dexia BIL’s retail
and private banking businesses and retain the remaining 10
percent. Regulators said they did not have enough information to
assess the value of the businesses “given that the proposed
sale is the result of exclusive negotiations with one private
investor.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
