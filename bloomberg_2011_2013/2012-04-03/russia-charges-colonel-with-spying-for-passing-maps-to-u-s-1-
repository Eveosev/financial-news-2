Russia  filed spying charges against
a reserve colonel accused of supplying maps to the U.S., the
Prosecutor General’s Office said.  The officer, named as Vladimir Lazar, is alleged to have
passed on 7,000 electronic maps to the Pentagon in 2008 via a
Russian based in  Estonia  working for American intelligence,
allowing the U.S. to plan military actions in Russia, the office
in Moscow said today in an e-mailed statement.  “According to experts, the topographical maps obtained by
the U.S. Defense Department contain state secrets,” the
Prosecutor General’s Office said. “Passing them to the military
structures of other countries risks serious damage to Russia’s
security.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
