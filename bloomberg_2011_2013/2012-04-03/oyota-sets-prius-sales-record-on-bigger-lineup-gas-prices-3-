Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s U.S. sales of
Prius hybrids reached a record in March and in the first
quarter, propelled by higher gasoline prices and two new models.  Toyota, the largest seller of gasoline-electric autos, sold
28,711 units in March of the Prius “family,” now comprising a
plug-in Prius and c subcompact, the original hatchback and v
wagon, the company said today in an e-mailed statement. Prius
sales surged 54 percent from a year ago, and topped the previous
monthly best of 24,009 set in May 2007.  First-quarter sales for the world’s best-selling
alternative powertrain car keeps Toyota on track to meet a goal
of 220,000 Prius sales in the U.S. this year, up from 136,463 in
2011. The vehicle accounts for half of U.S. hybrid sales. A
shortage of the car last year due to  Japan ’s earthquake and
tsunami cut industrywide deliveries to about 273,000 units from
about 275,000 a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “At this pace, and with the recovery in the  U.S. economy ,
Toyota’s target for Prius sales looks fairly doable,” said
Takashi Aoki, senior fund manager at Mizuho Asset Management Co.
in  Tokyo .  Toyota’s American depositary receipts fell 0.5 percent to
$86.22 at the close of trading in  New York .  First-Quarter Record  First-quarter Prius sales were 60,859. The model’s best
previous quarter was April-June 2007, said  Celeste Migliore , a
spokeswoman for the company’s U.S. sales unit in Torrance,
 California .  “Toyota’s move to raise the price of their bigger Prius
models is a good sign that the company is trying to make the
models more profitable, too,” Aoki said, citing the carmaker’s
planned $150 price increase for the v wagon model.  Hybrid sales typically track the cost of gasoline, rising
in line with pump price increases. Regular grade gasoline cost
an average of  $3.92 (3AGSREG)  a gallon on April 2, up from $3.28 at the
end of last year, according to AAA’s  Daily Fuel Gauge .  “Fuel economy remains a top purchase consideration among
consumers, and we are pleased with the continued response to
Toyota’s lineup,”  Bob Carter , group vice president of U.S.
sales, said in an e-mail yesterday.  The original Prius hatchback and the Prius c are rated as
delivering an average of 50 miles (80 kilometers) per gallon in
combined city and highway driving by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. The Prius v wagon averages 42 mpg and the
plug-in Prius, able to go as far as 15 miles on electricity
alone, is rated as getting 95 mpg-equivalent when drivers
frequently recharge the lithium-ion battery pack, according to
the EPA.  The Toyota City, Japan-based company today reported
combined sales of Toyota, Lexus and Scion models of 203,282
vehicles from a year ago, a 15 percent increase, matching the
average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
