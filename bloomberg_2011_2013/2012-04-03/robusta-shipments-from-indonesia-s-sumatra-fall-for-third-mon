Coffee-bean exports from  Indonesia ’s
southern Sumatra, the main growing region in the world’s third-
biggest robusta producer, declined for the third straight month
in March due to limited supplies.  Overseas sales from Lampung, Bengkulu and South Sumatra
provinces, which grow mostly robusta, declined to 5,070 metric
tons last month from 5,358 tons in February, according to data
released today by the Lampung trade and industry office.  Falling shipments from the Southeast Asian country may help
to extend the 12 percent rally this year in London on the price
of the bitter-tasting robusta variety used in instant drinks,
because of fewer cargoes from  Vietnam , the largest producer.
 Brazil  is the second-biggest grower and Indonesia ranked third.  “There aren’t too many beans available as supplies only
came from plantations on the low-lying areas that have an early
harvest with small quantities,” said Mochtar Luthfie, head of
research and development at the Lampung branch of the
Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters and Industry. This
year’s main harvest would run from May to July, with a smaller
crop through September, he added.  The three provinces account about 75 percent of supplies
from Indonesia. The beans were shipped from Panjang port in
Lampung.  May-delivery robusta futures fell 0.3 percent to $2,030 a
ton on the NYSE Liffe Exchange in  London  at 3:28 p.m. Jakarta
time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
