Occupy  London  protesters who camped
outside  St. Paul’s Cathedral  for more than four months cost City
of London Police more than 911,000 pounds ($1.5 million) to
monitor, according to their response to a Freedom of Information
request.  The protest encampment, the anti-capitalism campaigners’
largest in London, cost 525,257 pounds to move officers from
other duties and 386,434 pounds in expenses such as overtime,
City of London Police said in an e-mail.  The police said the cost didn’t include three other protest
camps and squats formed in and around the City of London. No
employment hours were lost to staff injury in policing the
movement, according to the e-mail.  Wealth disparities fueled protests around the globe last
year. The Occupy Movement began in September, when protesters
took up residence in  New York ’s Zuccotti Park to highlight the
plight of Americans who suffered even as the largest U.S. banks
recovered from the 2008 financial crisis.  Demonstrators inspired by the Occupy Wall Street protests
in New York moved to St. Paul’s in October, leading to the
cathedral’s temporary closure later that month. Police
dismantled tents and makeshift shelters as they evicted Occupy
London demonstrators from their campsite outside St. Paul’s on
Feb. 28.  Evicting protesters from their encampment around  City Hall 
in November cost Los Angeles taxpayers $2.35 million, officials
said Dec. 23. The New York police department spent $7 million in
overtime on the protests, while Boston spent $575,000, the
Associated Press reported in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
