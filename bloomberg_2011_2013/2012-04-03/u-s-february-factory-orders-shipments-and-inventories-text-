Following are the details of Feb.
full report on Manufacturers’ Shipments, Inventories and
Orders from the Commerce Department.  Benchmark Notice  Revised historical data for Manufacturers’ Shipments,
Inventories, and Orders will be issued on May 18, 2012.
These revisions reflect:  benchmarking the shipments and inventories data to the 2010
Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) data, as well as revised ASM
benchmarks for prior years;  incorporating the unfilled orders to shipments ratios obtained
from the 2009/2010 Manufacturers’ Unfilled Orders Survey by
applying these ratios to the respective ASM shipments data, as
well as incorporating revised unfilled orders to shipments
ratios for prior years;  adjusting the new orders data to be consistent with the
benchmarked shipments and unfilled orders data;  correcting monthly data for late receipts, reclassifications of
reported data, and revisions to previously reported data;  incorporating the monthly data corrections when producing
estimates for industry groups for which we identified companies
to be tabbed separately from the link-relative estimation
procedure;  implementing a new SAS® benchmarking program, which is based on
the same benchmarking methodology as the previous ASCII Fortran
program; and  updating the seasonally adjusted data, based on the results of
benchmarking and the recent annual review of the seasonal
adjustment models.  February Text  New orders for manufactured goods in February, up three of the
