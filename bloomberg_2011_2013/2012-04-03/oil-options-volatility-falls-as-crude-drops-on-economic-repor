Oil options volatility slipped as
the underlying futures fell after the  Federal Reserve  said it’s
holding off on increasing monetary stimulus.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 23.7 percent as of 4 p.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange versus 24.4 percent yesterday.  Crude for May delivery dropped $1.22 to settle at $104.01 a
barrel on the Nymex after minutes of the Fed’s March 13 meeting,
released today, showed a decreased urgency to add monetary
accommodation. The Commerce Department reported factory bookings
rose 1.3 percent in February, lower than the 1.5 percent
projected in a Bloomberg News survey of 60 economists.  “There was a tremendous amount of fear premium in crude
and some of that is getting taken out now,” Todd Horwitz, chief
strategist at Adam Mesh Trading Group in  New York , said in a
telephone interview. “Just the way the market’s been trading in
such tight ranges is also decreasing volatility.”  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $100 puts, which rose 10 cents to 62 cents a barrel at 4:01
p.m. in New York with 1,916 contracts trading. Next were June
$95 puts with 1,830 lots changing hands. They increased 11 cents
to 92 cents.  Puts accounted for 55 percent of electronic trading volume.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish options accounted for 58 percent of the 118,788
trades yesterday. June $100 puts were the most active, with
10,251 lots changing hands as they fell 87 cents to $1.73 a
barrel. The next-most active options, May $100 puts, dropped 65
cents to 52 cents on volume of 8,830.  Open interest in the previous session was highest for
December $80 puts with 45,872 contracts. Next were December $150
calls with 39,033 lots and December $100 calls with 34,927.  To contact the reporter on this story:
