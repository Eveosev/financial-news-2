E-Star Alternativ Nyrt. (ESTAR) , a Hungarian
energy company, gained for the first time in seven days on signs
the stock may be oversold.  The shares rose 1.1 percent to 2,850 forint by 10:18 a.m.
in Budapest.  The shares fell to the lowest since July 2009 last week
after the company reported a net loss for 2011. The stockâ€™s 16
percent plunge in the six days through yesterday pushed its 14-
day  relative strength index  to 30. A reading of 30 or below
indicates to some technical analysts that a security is
oversold. The RSI last traded at 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
