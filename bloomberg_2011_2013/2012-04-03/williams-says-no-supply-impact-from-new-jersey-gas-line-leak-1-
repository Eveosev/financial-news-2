A small leak on a segment of
Williams Cos.’ Transco natural gas pipeline in  North Bergen ,  New
Jersey , will have no impact on supplies to customers, the
company said.  “During a routine inspection of our 36-inch Transco line
in Bergen County, New Jersey, we discovered a tiny, pinhole leak
in the pipe,” Chris Stockton, a spokesman for the company in
Houston, said today in an e-mailed response to questions. “We
stopped flowing gas through the pipe and removed the gas from
that section of line.”  Gas volumes have been diverted to other delivery points,
Stockton said. Williams has no estimate for when repairs to the
line will be completed, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
