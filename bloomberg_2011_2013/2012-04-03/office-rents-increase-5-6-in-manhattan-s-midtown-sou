Rising demand for space from
Internet and media firms helped boost rents at office buildings
south of midtown  Manhattan  by 5.6 percent in the first quarter,
according to a report by Cushman & Wakefield Inc.  Rents in  Midtown South (CWRR1NMS) , the area below 32nd Street and
north of Canal Street, rose to $48.45 a square foot from $45.90
at the end of 2011, Cushman said today in a statement. Asking
rents at the highest-quality office properties rose 18 percent
to $67.52 a square foot, or about $4.56 less than Midtown’s so-
called Class A buildings. Midtown South’s  vacancy rate  fell to
5.9 percent, the lowest of any U.S. business district.  Increasing rents reflect “a whole cultural change” taking
place in Midtown South, which includes such trendy neighborhoods
as Chelsea and the Meatpacking and Flatiron districts, said
 Joseph Harbert , Cushman’s New York-area chief operating officer.
“Creative” firms are crowding into those areas, while rents in
the more traditional office markets in Midtown and lower
Manhattan grow more slowly, he said.  “Everyone wants to be in Midtown South,” Harbert said in
a telephone interview. “It’s been desirable from a residential
standpoint, and retail. And now people want to live close to
where things are cool, and then they want to work there too.”  Rents sought by landlords throughout Manhattan rose 3
percent from the fourth quarter to $58.96 a square foot, while
the borough’s vacancy rate was unchanged at 9.1 percent. In
 Midtown (CWRR1NMT) , rents gained 2 percent to $66.70 a square foot, and
vacancies climbed to 9.9 percent from 9.6 percent.  Downtown (CWRR1NDT) 
rents increased 1.2 percent to $40.37 a square foot as the
vacancy rate fell to 9.2 percent from 9.5 percent.  Steeper Increases  Manhattan in general is poised for steeper rent growth and
vacancy declines, said Kenneth McCarthy, senior economist at
Cushman. Office rents may increase about 15 percent by the end
of 2013, he projected.  A mid-March revision by the U.S Labor Department showed  New
York City  added 71,900 jobs in 2011, almost twice the earlier
estimate. The city now has a record 3.838 million jobs,
exceeding the previous high of 3.83 million set in June 1969,
McCarthy said. It is among three U.S. cities that have recovered
all the jobs lost in the 2009 recession -- the others are
Washington and Houston -- and employment growth should continue
in the next few years, he said.  The market will add about 7 million square feet (650,000
square meters) of offices by 2015, mostly because of the
rebuilding of the World Trade Center, bringing the total to
about 400 million square feet, McCarthy said. That won’t be
enough to head off rent increases, he said.  Financial Companies  In the first quarter, leasing by information and media
companies overtook financial services, the traditional main
source of Manhattan office demand, for the first time in Cushman
records, Harbert said.  While financial companies still occupy a third of the
borough’s office space, they took only 26 percent of the 5.8
million square feet leased so far this year, compared with 28
percent for media and technology firms. Those companies tend to
seek spaces of less than 100,000 square feet, Harbert said.  Companies that signed leases in the quarter included
Chandler Chicco Agency, a health-care communications firm that
took 75,000 square feet at 450 West 15th St. in West Chelsea,
near  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s building at 111 Eighth Ave.  Take-Two
Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO) , publisher of the “Grand Theft Auto”
video games, took 68,000 square feet at 622 Broadway in NoHo,
according to Cushman.  Silicon Alley  Midtown South had an influx of Internet companies in the
late 1990s, when it became known as Silicon Alley, only to crash
in the dot-com bust. Even if something similar happened, the
area will remain desirable for tenants of all kinds, Harbert
said.  “People are actually choosing the ambiance, the aura,” he
said. “There’s something about being down there that makes them
feel good about going to work every day as opposed to being in
the canyons of Sixth Avenue, in a corporate mode. There’s a non-
corporate trend going on as well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
