Chile’s peso strengthened for a
third day amid speculation the central bank will signal
interest-rate increases in a speech today as inflation quickens.  The peso gained 0.3 percent to 481.95 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:03 a.m. in Santiago, from 483.25 yesterday.  Central bank President Rodrigo Vergara will deliver to
Congress today his quarterly monetary policy report, including
forecasts for gross domestic product, copper prices and
inflation. Interest-rate swaps and breakeven inflation rates
have surged the most in at least three years since Vergara
unexpectedly lowered rates by a quarter point in January in just
his second meeting as president.  “Investors are waiting for the policy report and are
guessing the central bank will hint at potential rate increases,
which would strengthen the peso,” said Sergio Tricio, an
analyst at ForexChile in Santiago. “Also, copper broke an
important resistance level yesterday and that’s pushing up the
peso.”  Copper for May delivery rose 0.2 percent to $3.9275 a pound
in  New York  today after surging as much as 2.8 percent
yesterday. Chile is the biggest producer of the metal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
