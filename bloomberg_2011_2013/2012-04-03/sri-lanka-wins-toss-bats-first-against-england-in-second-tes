Sri Lanka  recovered to 82-3 against
England at lunch on day one of their series-deciding second
cricket Test after James Anderson took three quick wickets.  Fast bowler Anderson removed Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara and Lahiru Thirimanne to reduce Sri Lanka to 30-3
after captain Mahela Jayawardenewon the toss in Colombo.
Jayawardene (40 not out) combined for a 52-run unbeaten
partnership with Thilan Samaraweera (20) to rally his team.  England, which must win at the P. Sara Oval to retain the
No. 1 Test ranking, made two changes to the team that lost the
opening Test in Galle by 75 runs as  Steve Finn  and Tim Bresnan
came in for Stuart Broad andMonty Panesar.  South Africa  would
take the top spot should England fail to win.  Sri Lanka, seeking its first Test series victory since
August 2009, also made two changes.  Angelo Mathews  returned from
injury to replace Dinesh Chandimal and Dhammika Prasad took over
from injured seamer Chanaka Welegedara.  Last week’s defeat was England’s fourth straight in elite
Tests following a 3-0 sweep of losses against Pakistan in the
United Arab Emirates. It last won a Test series on the road
against Asian teams other then bottom-ranked Bangladesh in 2001,
when it won 2-1 in Sri Lanka.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
