Ampal-American Israel Corp. (AMPL) , which
holds a stake in a company that exports natural gas from Egypt
to Israel, rallied the most in almost three months after Globes
reported it reached an agreement with bondholders.  The  shares of Ampal , which owns 12.5 percent of East
Mediterranean Gas Co., roared 22 percent, the most since Jan. 8,
to 1.023 shekels at 1:07 p.m. in  Tel Aviv .  The company reached an accord with investors who held its
largest outstanding series of bonds, Globes said, without saying
where it got the information. A message left with a company
spokesman wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
