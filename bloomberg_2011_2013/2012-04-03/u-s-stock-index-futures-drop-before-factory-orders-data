U.S. stocks fell, a day after the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose to the highest level since
2008, as minutes from the  Federal Reserve ’s latest policy
meeting damped expectations for more monetary stimulus.  Companies whose earnings are most tied to economic swings
led the retreat, with  S&P 500 indexes  tracking energy, financial
and raw-materials stocks falling at least 0.7 percent.
Transocean Ltd. and  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  declined more than 2.8
percent as oil and gold prices slid. General Motors Co. sank 4.6
percent after posting vehicle sales that trailed estimates. 
Apple (AAPL)  Inc. advanced 1.7 percent to a record after two analysts
said the stock could surge to $1,000.  The S&P 500 dropped 0.4 percent to 1,413.38 today. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  lost 64.94 points, or 0.5 percent, to
13,199.55 after reaching the highest level since December 2007
yesterday. About 6.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S.
exchanges, compared to the one-year average of 7.5 billion.  “Everybody would like a little more stimulus,” James Dunigan, who helps oversee $107 billion as chief investment
officer in Philadelphia for PNC Wealth Management, said in a
telephone interview. “It reiterates what the chairman’s been
saying that they saw continuously moderate economic growth and
they stand ready to do something but at the moment, there’s no
immediate need to do any additional stimulus.”  Equities extended losses as the minutes of the March 13
meeting showed a decreased urgency to add monetary stimulus. The
Fed indicated that it is holding off on increasing monetary
accommodation unless the U.S. economic expansion falters or
prices rise at a rate slower than its 2 percent target. The
central bank last month affirmed its plan, first announced in
January, to hold  interest rates  near zero through late 2014.  Factory Orders  Stocks fell earlier as figures from the Commerce Department
showed factory bookings in February rose 1.3 percent after a
revised 1.1 percent decline in January. The median of 60
economists’ projections in a Bloomberg News survey called for a
1.5 percent advance. Orders excluding transportation equipment
increased by the most in five months.  The  S&P 500  climbed to the highest level since May 2008
yesterday after a report showed stronger-than-forecast growth in
U.S. manufacturing. The index  rose 12 percent  from January
through March for the best first-quarter rally since 1998 as
economic data surpassed estimates and investors speculated that
the euro area would contain its sovereign-debt crisis.  ‘Over-Optimistic’  “The market is over-optimistic about corporate profit and
GDP growth for the rest of the year,” David Pearl, who oversees
$21 billion in assets as co-chief investment officer at New
York-based Epoch Investment Partners, said in a telephone
interview. “We’re in a recovery, but the market has pretty much
discounted that.”  Investors sold shares of companies tied to the economy. The
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  Cyclical Index lost 0.8 percent. The Dow Jones
Transportation Average, a proxy for economic growth, erased 0.2
percent.  S&P 500 indexes tracking energy and raw-materials producers
dropped 1 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively. Transocean fell
2.8 percent to $53.64. Newmont Mining slipped 3.4 percent to
$50.34.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  slumped 3.5 percent to $25.40.  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  retreated 0.3 percent.  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM)  declined 1.5 percent to $45.42 while  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  fell 1.8 percent to $122.71. Morgan Stanley dropped 2.2
percent to $19.37.  General Motors sank 4.6 percent to $25.54 after posting
gains in U.S. vehicle sales that trailed analysts’ estimates. GM
sales of cars and light trucks rose 12 percent, according to
company statements. The average of 10 analysts’ estimates was
for gains of 19 percent at GM.  Beer Brands  Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP)  fell 5.4 percent to $43.18. The
U.S. maker of Carling lager agreed to buy StarBev LP for 2.65
billion euros ($3.54 billion) to add beer brands such as
Staropramen and provide a route into central and eastern  Europe .   Apple advanced 1.7 percent to $629.32. The world’s most
valuable company could surge to $1,000 by 2014,  Gene Munster , an
analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos., said in a note to clients today.
He raised his 12-month price target to $910 from $718.  Brian
White , an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets, yesterday set an
estimate of $1,001.  Wall Street strategists cut their recommended holdings in
U.S. equities to almost the lowest level since 1998, a sign that
the six-month stock rally may have more room to go, according to
Bank of America Corp.  Strategists’ Advice  Strategists advised investors to reduce equity allocations
in six out of the past eight months, with money earmarked to
stocks falling to 55.8 percent in March. The level was the
lowest since January 1998, except for the seven months ended
July 2009, and compared with a 15-year average of 60.7 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Bank of America.  Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative
strategy at Bank of America, said the decline in recommended
stock holdings signaled rising pessimism that she considers as a
contrarian indicator because investors who have sold shares now
have more money to purchase stocks.  “We take some comfort in  Wall Street ’s lack of optimism,”
Subramanian wrote in a note yesterday. “It has historically
been a bullish signal when Wall Street was extremely bearish.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
