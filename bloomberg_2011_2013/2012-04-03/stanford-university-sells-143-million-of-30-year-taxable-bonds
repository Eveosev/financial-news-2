Stanford University  sold $143
million of taxable, senior unsecured bonds due in 30 years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Stanford, the fifth-richest U.S. school, issued the 4.013
percent notes due in May 2042 to yield 70 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley managed the offering.  Stanford joins a procession of schools including  University
of Pennsylvania  and  Northwestern University  that usually sell
tax-free debt in the municipal market. These institutions are
now tapping demand for taxable corporate bonds in the highest
ratings categories.  Moody’s Investors Service assigned an Aaa grade to
Stanford’s taxable debt, the ratings firm said in a March 28
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
