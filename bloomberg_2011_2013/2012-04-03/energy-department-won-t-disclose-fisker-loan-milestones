The U.S. Department of Energy won’t
disclose milestones Fisker Automotive Inc. had to meet for
getting $529 million in U.S. electric-vehicle development loans,
it said in responding to a Freedom of Information Act request.  Judicial Watch, a Washington-based advocacy group, sought
records including required milestones for the Karma, a $103,000
sports car built in  Finland , and a proposed second model, the
Nina. The information is  trade secrets  exempt from disclosure,
according to a department letter. Damien LaVera, a department
spokesman, verified the agency sent Judicial Watch the letter.  Fisker, based in Anaheim,  California , said in February that
it was suspending work at a former General Motors Co. plant in
Delaware it acquired to produce the Nina after the Energy
Department froze its credit for missing milestones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
