Deka Immobilien GmbH agreed to buy
the  London  headquarters of Guardian Media Group Plc from Peter Millican, a property developer and philanthropist, a spokeswoman
for the property said.  Kings Place, home to the Guardian newspaper’s publisher,
was put up for sale in October. The purchase price wasn’t
disclosed, spokeswoman Erica Bolton said in an e-mail today.
Property Week reported earlier today that Deka’s WestInvest
InterSelect fund bought the property, which also includes two
public concert spaces, bars and restaurants.  Parabola Land Ltd., the closely held company that’s selling
Kings Place, made a profit of 4.2 million pounds ($6.8 million)
for the year through March 2011, according to a regulatory
filing.  Daniela Gniss, a spokeswoman for Deka, declined to comment.
Property Week said Kings Place was put on the market for 235
million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
