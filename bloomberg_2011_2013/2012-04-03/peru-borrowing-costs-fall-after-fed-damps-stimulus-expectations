Peru ’s benchmark borrowing costs in
dollars fell to a two-week low after minutes from the Federal
Reserve’s latest policy meeting damped expectations for more
monetary stimulus.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 148 at 3:36 p.m. in Lima, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBIG index.  U.S. Treasuries fell after the Fed indicated it is holding
off on increasing monetary accommodation unless the economic
expansion falters or prices rise at a rate slower than its 2
percent target. The statement disappointed investors who had
been expecting the Fed to signal plans for a new round of asset
purchases, said Alberto Bernal, head of fixed-income research at
Bulltick Capital Markets in Miami.  “Even though the economy isn’t out of the woods, it
doesn’t need further easing at this point,” Bernal said.  The sol was little changed at 2.6670 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.6680 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  Peru’s central bank  bought  $65 million in the  spot market 
today to stem gains in the sol. It paid 2.6670 soles per dollar,
according to a statement on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
