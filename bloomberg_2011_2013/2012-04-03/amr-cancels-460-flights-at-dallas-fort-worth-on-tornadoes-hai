American Airlines  and regional
carrier American Eagle canceled about 460 flights into and out
of  Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport  today as tornadoes,
hail and thunderstorms moved through the area.  “We’re pretty well out of the flying business for the rest
of the day today,”  Tim Smith , an American spokesman, said in an
interview. “Virtually all of our inbound flights will not take
off and arrive this evening.”  Several tornadoes, baseball-sized hail and thunderstorms
moved through the area today, according to the National Weather
Service. Flights into the airport were halted about 1:30 p.m.
local time. American and American Eagle are units of Fort Worth-
based  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ)   Because of the weather, at least 101 American and Eagle
aircraft must undergo hail inspections before they can be flown,
Smith said. Forty-eight flights headed for the airport were
diverted before they could arrive, he said. Buildings at the
airport were also being checked for damage, said  David Magana , a
spokesman.  As the storm neared the airport, U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration air-traffic controllers briefed pilots about
weather cells moving through the area, the agency said in an e-
mailed statement.  “All of the pilots in aircraft waiting to take off elected
to stay on the airfield,” the agency said in the statement.  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  canceled 25 flights from Dallas Love
Field Airport and some flights were diverted before arriving,
said Brandy King, a spokeswoman for the carrier. Southwest has
no reports of hail damage, she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
