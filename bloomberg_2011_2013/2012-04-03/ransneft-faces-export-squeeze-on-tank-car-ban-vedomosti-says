OAO Transneft,  Russia ’s oil pipeline
operator, faces a tank car shortage for exports and deliveries
to OAO Rosneft’s Komsomolsk refinery after OAO Russian Railways
banned the use of some wagons,  Vedomosti  said, citing a letter
from the company to the government.  From April 1, Russian Railways banned Transneft from
shipping heavy oil in tanks intended to carry light oil products
after several accidents with overweight cars, the Moscow-based
newspaper said.  The ban will force Transneft to idle 5,000 of the 8,000
cars it uses to deliver oil from the current end of the East
Siberian Pacific Ocean pipeline in Skovorodino to the future end
point in Nakhodka on Russia’s Far Eastern coast, Vedomosti said,
citing the letter from company President Nikolay Tokarev to
Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Sechin .  To contact the reporter on this story:
