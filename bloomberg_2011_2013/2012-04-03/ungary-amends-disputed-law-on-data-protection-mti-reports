Hungarian lawmakers amended a
disputed bill on the data protection agency to bring the law in
line with European Union recommendations, state news service  MTI 
said, without citing anyone.  The amendment strengthens the agencyâ€™s independence and
curbs the power of the president and the prime minister to
dismiss the head of the institution, according to MTI.  The law on data protection was among the three pieces of
Hungarian legislation over which the EU started infringement
procedures against the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
