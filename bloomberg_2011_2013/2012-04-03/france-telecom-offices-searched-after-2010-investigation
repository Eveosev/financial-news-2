France Telecom SA (FTE) ,  France ’s biggest
phone company, said its offices were searched today by police in
connection with an investigation by Paris prosecutors after a
spate of employee suicides in 2010.  “We confirm that a search took place today,” said a
spokeswoman for the Paris-based company, who declined to be
named. The search, which took place over several sites, follows
a complaint filed by labor union Sud-PTT, she said.  Investigators are looking into allegations of “mental
harassment” and missing workplace-risk documentation at the
company. Sud-PTT has complained that  France Telecom ’s
restructuring policy contributed “directly” to about 30
suicides and “a tendency toward depression” at the company.  Elisabeth Allanic, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutors’
office, wasn’t immediately available to comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
