A military court sentenced an army
officer who took part in protests to six years in prison, Al-
Ahram gate reported.  Ahmed Shouman faced several charges including absence from
his unit to participate in protests, failure to “obey military
orders” and expressing political views on satellite channels in
violation of a law forbidding military personnel from doing so,
the state-run news website reported.  The head of the ruling military council, Field Marshal
Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, had previously pardoned Shouman after
he took part in the uprising that ousted  Hosni Mubarak . Shouman
later participated, wearing his uniform, in demonstrations
against military rule, Al-Ahram said.  Protesters have demanded that the military council which
took interim rule from Mubarak cede power, accusing it of
mismanaging the transition and stifling dissent. The council has
said it will transfer rule to civilians by the end of June. The
first presidential elections since Mubarak’s ouster will begin
in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
