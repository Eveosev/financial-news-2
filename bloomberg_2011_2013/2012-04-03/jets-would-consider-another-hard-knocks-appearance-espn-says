The  New York Jets  would consider
another appearance on “Hard Knocks,” the Home Box Office Inc.
show that documents  National Football League  training camps,
owner Woody Johnson said, according to  ESPN .  The Jets in 2010 were featured on the series, which was
canceled by HBO last season because of the NFL’s four-month
lockout and shortened offseason. Johnson, speaking with
reporters yesterday at a promotional appearance in New York,
said the Jets have had informal talks with HBO and “will take a
look at it” if they receive an official invitation, ESPN said.  The Jets this offseason added quarterback Tim Tebow to a
team that finished last year 8-8 and missed the playoffs as they
were beset by locker-room controversy, including verbal
altercations between starting quarterback  Mark Sanchez  and
receiver Santonio Holmes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
