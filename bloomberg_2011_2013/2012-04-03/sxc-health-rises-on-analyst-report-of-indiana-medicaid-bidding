SXC Health Solutions Corp. (SXCI)  climbed
6.4 percent after JMP Securities analysts said the pharmacy
benefits manager was selected to handle  Indiana ’s Medicaid
program.  SXC rose to $78.87 at the close of New York trading, the
biggest increase since Jan. 10. The Lisle, Illinois-based
company has gained 40 percent this year.  The benefits manager won a competitive bidding process to
begin contract talks with the Indiana Department of
Administration, Constantine Davides, an analyst for JMP
Securities, wrote in a note. The contract’s value may be $32
million, he estimated.  The choice highlighted SXC’s “ability to administer a high
level of customization and service, particularly in the more
complex Medicaid market,” Davides wrote in the note. He
reiterated his rating of Market Outperform and put a price
target on the stock of $79.  Tony Perkins, a spokesman for SXC, declined to comment.  SXC was selected over the incumbent pharmacy benefits
manager ACS Healthcare, Davides said.  SXC has been cited by analysts as a possible takeover
target after St. Louis-based Express Scripts Inc.’s $29.1
billion acquisition of Medco, which was cleared by U.S.
regulators yesterday. SXC may attract suitors from UnitedHealth
Group Inc. to Catalyst Health Solutions Inc., according to Wall
Street Access and Leerink Swann LLC last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
