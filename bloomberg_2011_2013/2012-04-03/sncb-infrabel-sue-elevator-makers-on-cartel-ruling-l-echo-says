Belgian rail companies SNCB Holding
SA and Infrabel SA are suing four of the world’s largest
elevator manufacturers,  L’Echo  reported, citing a court filing.  The rail firms have opened legal proceedings in a Belgian
court on the basis of a European Union antitrust decision
against  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Otis unit,  Finland ’s  Kone
Oyj (KNEBV) ,  Schindler Holding AG (SCHD) , and  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) , the newspaper
said. The companies were among five that were  fined  a total of
992.3 million euros ($1.3 billion) by the European Commission in
2007 for participating in a cartel that carved up the market for
elevators and escalators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
