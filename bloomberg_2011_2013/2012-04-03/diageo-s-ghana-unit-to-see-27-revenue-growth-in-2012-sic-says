Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd. (GGBL) , a
unit of  Diageo Plc (DGE) , will see revenue rise by 27 percent in the
fiscal year through June as economic growth drives demand, SIC
Financial Services Ltd. Research Analyst Derrick Mensah said.  The Accra-based brewer’s revenue will climb to 310.3
million cedis ($174 million) from 244.3 million last year, he
said by phone today.  “We expect demand for the company’s products to rise as
economic growth puts more money in people’s pockets,” Mensah
said.  Guinness Ghana makes the stout beer in the West Africa’s
second-biggest economy, which grew 13.6 percent in 2011 and is
forecast to expand 9.4 percent this year, according to the
 Finance Ministry . The company also brews Star lager and non-
alcoholic beverages.  A 70 million-cedi rights offer in November helped the
company pay down debt and invest in infrastructure. The lower
costs will push net income to 19.5 million cedis from 533,000
cedis the year before, said Mensah.  In the July to June 2013 fiscal period, revenue growth will
expand at a slower pace of 24 percent amid an “unfavorable
economic climate, characterized by post election economic
stress,” he said. Growth in 2013 is projected at 8 percent by
the ministry.  Rob Pilkington, Guinness  Ghana ’s director of finance, was
not immediately available to comment, according to a woman who
answered the phone at his office today.  The company’s stock traded unchanged in Accra at 1.67 cedis
by 11:29 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
