Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. asked
banks for feedback as it seeks to amend the terms and extend the
maturity of a A$905 million ($939 million) loan, according to
three people familiar with the matter.  The private equity firm used the debt, due next year, to
buy BIS Industries Ltd. from  Brambles Ltd. (BXB)  in 2006, the people
said, asking not to be identified because the details are
private. A spokesman for KKR in  Hong Kong  declined to comment on
the financing talks.  The London-based firm  bought  Brambles Industrial Services
and Cleanaway  Australia , as the businesses were then known, from
Sydney-based Brambles in June 2006, according to BIS Industriesâ€™
website. In May 2007, KKR sold the Cleanaway business and the
remaining assets were renamed BIS Industries.  The A$905 million loan matures in May 2013, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The largest portion of that debt
pays a margin of 225 basis points more than the benchmark bank
bill swap rate, the data show. Having received feedback from
banks, KKR is expected to begin marketing debt with revised
terms to lenders in about a month, the people said today.  BIS Industries has operations in coal mining, steel and
iron ore and provides a range of logistical and distribution
services, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
