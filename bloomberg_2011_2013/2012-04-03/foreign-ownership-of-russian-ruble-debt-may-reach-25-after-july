Foreign ownership of Russian
domestic debt may reach 25 percent after July 1 from about 3
percent now as the government takes measures to ease
restrictions on the local market, Konstantin Vyshkovsky, head of
the Finance Ministry debt department, told reporters in Moscow
today.  Russia expects to allow its government debt to be settled
through Euroclear Bank SA, the worldâ€™s biggest bond-settlement
system, as early as July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
