Ferrovial SA (FER) , a Spanish builder and
airport operator, dropped the most since October last year after
government changes to corporate taxes capped deductions on
financial costs.  Ferrovial fell as much as 6.6 percent, the biggest intraday
drop since Oct. 5, and closed in  Madrid  at 8.24 euros, a decline
of 6.4 percent. It was the worst performer on the benchmark  IBEX
35 (IBEX)  Index today.  As part of its budget measures affecting taxes, the
government will cap deductions on financial costs to 30 percent
of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Ferrovial may be among Spanish companies most affected by the
change, Banco Sabadell SA’s research department said in a note
published yesterday.  Still, in a separate note published yesterday, Sabadell’s
research team said other builders may be more affected than
Ferrovial, which has a lower taxable base in  Spain .  Builder Fomento de Construcciones & Contratas SA fell as
much as 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
