SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) , the biggest maker of
flash-memory cards, fell the most in two months after cutting
its forecast for first-quarter sales and profitability, citing
weaker-than-expected pricing and demand for components that
store data in mobile phones.  The  stock  declined 11 percent to $44.51 at the close in  New
York  after the company’s forecast yesterday, its biggest decline
since Jan. 26. The Milpitas, California-based company’s shares
are down 9.6 percent this year.  SanDisk and its competitors are pumping out more
electronics components than the consumer-electronics industry
needs, according to  Daniel Berenbaum , an analyst at MKM Partners
LLC in New York.  “Demand is OK, but there’s an awful lot of supply out
there,” said Berenbaum, who has a neutral  rating  on SanDisk.
“It’s a supply-driven business.”  Revenue in the quarter that ended April 1 will be about
$1.2 billion, compared with an earlier forecast for $1.3 billion
to $1.35 billion, SanDisk said in a statement. Gross margin, a
yardstick of profitability, will be below 39 percent to 42
percent, the company’s previous prediction, said SanDisk, which
also makes the chips that go into  flash-memory  cards.  Under Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra, SanDisk has
been trying to win more chip sales from makers of mobile phones
and lessen its reliance on revenue from memory cards, such as
those used in digital cameras.  Gross margin measures the percentage of sales remaining
after deducting the cost of production.  Separately,  Micron Technology Inc. (MU) , which competes with
SanDisk in so-called flash memory, fell 4.1 percent to $7.66.
The Boise, Idaho-based company, which reported a third
consecutive quarterly loss last month, is up 22 percent this
year on speculation it will benefit from industry consolation.  The 30-member Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which
includes SanDisk and Micron, dropped 2.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
