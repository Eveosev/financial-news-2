Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO) , the largest cement maker
in the Americas, led declines on Mexico’s benchmark index as
Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB said gains among the country’s best
performing equities may be overdone.  Cemex, the gauge’s second-best performer in the first
quarter, fell 2.1 percent to 9.70 pesos at 2:21 p.m. in Mexico
City, while  Empresas Ica SAB (ICA*) , the country’s top stock in the
period, declined 1.6 percent to 23.99 pesos. The IPC gauge fell
0.1 percent.  “For short-term investment strategies, we can suggest
taking profits on the companies that have had the biggest gains
in the past days,” said Carlos Hermosillo, an analyst with
Banorte, in an e-mailed research note. “The market is getting
ahead of itself.”  Mexico’s benchmark index extended gains to a record
yesterday, one session after central bank minutes published
March 30 showed policy makers are considering cutting interest
rates. The  IPC (MEXBOL)  trades at 19.8 times trailing 12-month earnings,
compared with 13.9 times for MSCI Inc.’s  Latin America (MXLA)  index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
