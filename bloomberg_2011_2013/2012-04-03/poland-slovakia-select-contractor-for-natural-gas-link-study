Poland  and Slovakia selected a
contractor to prepare a feasibility study for a planned natural-
gas link between the two countries, according to Polish pipeline
operator Gaz-System SA.  Gaz-System and Slovak gas transmission system operator
 Eustream AS  plan to seek European Union funds to help finance
the link, Gaz-System said on its website.  The pipeline will be part of a planned pan-European gas
transmission route that may allow Poland to access the so-called
Southern Corridor intended to ship Caspian gas to the region. It
may also be used to export Polish shale gas to Slovakia in
future, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
