Taiwan’s dollar advanced to a one
month-high as signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering spurred
investor demand for riskier assets.  Government bonds  were steady.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares rose for a third day
after the U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
climbed to 53.4 in March from 52.4 in February, according to
data released yesterday. Global funds bought $5.1 billion more
of the island’s stocks than they sold this year, helping drive a
2.7 percent gain in the local dollar.  Consumer prices in Taiwan 
increased 1.32 percent in March from a year earlier, after a
0.25 percent gain in February, according to a Bloomberg survey
before a report due April 5.  “The recovery in the U.S. is going better than expected,”
said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc.
in Taipei. “Soaring consumer prices remain a concern in
 Taiwan .”  Taiwan’s dollar advanced 0.1 percent to NT$29.48 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.360, the strongest level since March 2. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings that traders use
to price options, fell 26 basis points to 3.74 percent.  The central bank left the benchmark  interest rate  at 1.875
percent last month and said it will focus on inflation rather
than boosting growth in 2012.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 was little changed at 1.022 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The overnight  money-market  rate slipped one
basis points, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.424 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
