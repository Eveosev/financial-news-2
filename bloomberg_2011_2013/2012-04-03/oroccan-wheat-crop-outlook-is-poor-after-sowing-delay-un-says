Morocco’s prospects for wheat and
coarse grains are “generally poor” after rain in November
delayed planting into December and January, the  United Nations ’
Food & Agriculture Organization said.  Unusually low February temperatures may have damaged crops
in fields, the Rome-based UN agency said in a  report  on its
website today. Satellite observations indicate less vegetation
and suggest a likely yield decline, it said.  Morocco is North Africa’s third-largest wheat buyer behind
Egypt and  Algeria . Domestic production fluctuates “markedly”
based on annual weather conditions, affecting Moroccan import
requirements, according to the FAO.  “Even in good years, the country relies heavily on wheat
imports from the international market to cover its consumption
needs,” the FAO said. “Given mixed prospects for this year’s
crop, cereal import requirements are expected to increase.”  Morocco will import 5.52 million metric tons of cereals in
the year through June, falling from 6.38 million tons in 2010-
11, the FAO forecast. Coarse grains include corn, barley and
sorghum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
