Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (HOV) , the
largest homebuilder in New Jersey, plans to sell 25 million
shares to buy debt.  The company will use proceeds from the sale to buy some of
its senior unsecured notes in a private transaction, the  Red
Bank , New Jersey-based company said today in a statement.
Hovnanian also said it may use money from the offering for
general corporate purposes, including debt payment or
refinancing. The shares fell after the close of regular trading
in New York.  Hovnanian reported a narrower first-quarter loss on March 7
as sales rose and the company reduced writedowns. As the housing
market recovers and the company returns to profitability, “we
should be able to issue equity at higher prices than today,”
 Larry Sorsby , Hovnanian’s chief financial officer, said in a
March 7 earnings conference call. The shares closed at $2.46
that day and have fallen 4.5 percent since then.  “It won’t make a dent in their debt load,”  Vicki Bryan , a
bond analyst at New York-based Gimme Credit LLC. “This could be
a red flag.”  The planned stock sale was announced after the end of
regular U.S. trading. The shares fell 2.9 percent to $2.35
as of 4:15 p.m. in New York. They traded as low as $2.03 after
the close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
