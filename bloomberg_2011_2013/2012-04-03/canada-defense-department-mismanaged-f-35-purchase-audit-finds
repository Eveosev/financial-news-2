Canadian defense department
officials mismanaged plans to purchase  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s
F-35 fighter jets and failed to adequately inform lawmakers of
the cost of the plane, the country’s top auditor found.  Canada’s Department of National Defence was “too
involved” with the development of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter
to run a fair competition for new jets, Auditor General Michael
Ferguson said in a statement issued today.  Defence officials didn’t provide complete cost information
to the nation’s lawmakers or fully inform people responsible for
the decision about the risks involved in buying the jets,
Ferguson’s office said after auditing the procurement process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
