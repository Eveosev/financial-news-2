Joey Votto agreed to a 10-year, $225
million contract extension with the  Cincinnati Reds  that could
keep the All-Star first baseman with the club through the 2023
Major League Baseball season,  USA Today  reported.  The deal would be the richest in franchise history and
includes a no-trade clause,  USA Today said , citing an
unidentified person familiar with the deal who couldn’t speak
publicly because it hadn’t been finalized.  It would also be the third major league contract of more
than $200 million signed by a first baseman this offseason.
Prince Fielder got a nine-year, $214 million free-agent deal
from the Detroit Tigers and Albert Pujols joined the  Los Angeles
Angels  for $240 million over 10 seasons.  Before this offseason,  Alex Rodriguez  of the  New York
Yankees  had been the only major league player to receive a
contract worth more than $200 million. The Yankees’ third
baseman has a 10-year, $277 million accord.  The San Francisco Giants yesterday signed pitcher Matt Cain
to a five-year contract extension through the 2017 season.  While the Giants didn’t disclose financial terms of the
deal, the San Francisco Chronicle said it’s worth $112.5 million,
making it the biggest long-term contract for a right-handed
pitcher, surpassing the $105 million the  Los Angeles Dodgers 
gave  Kevin Brown  after the 1998 season.  Cain’s contract also has an option year, the Giants said in
a news release on their website.  Most Valuable Player  Votto’s extension would keep the National League’s 2010
Most Valuable Player with the franchise that drafted him in 2002.
Over four full seasons in Cincinnati, Votto is hitting .313 with
119 home runs and 401 runs batted in.  Votto has two years remaining on the three-year, $38
million contract he signed with the Reds in January 2011. He’s
set to make $9.5 million this season and $17 million in 2013
before the extension kicks in the following year.  Votto hit .309 with 29 home runs and 103 runs batted in
over 161 games for the Reds last season while also winning his
first NL Gold Glove award for his defense.  In winning the NL MVP in 2010, Votto batted .324 with 37
home runs and 113 runs batted in.  The Reds open the regular season in two days against the
 Miami Marlins .  To contact the reporter on this story:
