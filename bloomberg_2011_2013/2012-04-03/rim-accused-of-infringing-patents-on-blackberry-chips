BlackBerry maker  Research In Motion
Ltd. (RIMM)  was accused of infringing six patents owned by  NXP
Semiconductor NV (NXPI)  for technology including ways to expand the
range of data transmission.  NXP, Europe’s third-largest chipmaker, filed the complaint
yesterday in  U.S. federal court  in Orlando, Florida. The Dutch
chipmaker, based in Eindhoven, Netherlands, seeks cash
compensation and a court order to block further use of its
inventions.  RIM products including the BlackBerry Torch, Playbook,
Curve and Bold are using the patented inventions without
permission, NXP contends. The other patents cover computer bus
systems, mobile phones with GPS receivers, circuit
manufacturing, the polishing of the surface of wafers, and
patterning of layers on the wafer.  Marisa Conway, a spokeswoman for Waterloo, Ontario-based
RIM, said the company doesn’t comment on pending litigation.  NXP is the former semiconductor unit of Royal Philips
Electronics NV. The company, which is working to reduce its
debt, reported $4.2 billion in sales last year.  RIM fell $1.36, or 9.5 percent, to $13.01 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, the biggest decline
since Dec. 16, as investors speculated that potential acquirers
are losing interest.  The case is NXP BV v.  Research in Motion Ltd. (RIM) , 12cv498,
U.S. District Court for the District in Orlando (Florida).  To contact the reporter on this story:
