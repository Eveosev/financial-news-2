The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment advanced in  Asia , according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 1 basis point to 154.5 basis points
as of 8:05 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The measure is set for its first increase in three
days, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed 1 basis point to
153.5 as of 9:04 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show.
This would be the first increase since March 29.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at
144.5 basis points as of 10:14 a.m. in Sydney, according to
prices from  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)   Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
