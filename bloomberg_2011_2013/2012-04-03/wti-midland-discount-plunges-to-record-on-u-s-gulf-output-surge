The price for West  Texas 
Intermediate oil in Midland, Texas, plunged to a record discount
versus the same grade in Cushing,  Oklahoma , as regional
production outpaced pipeline development.  Production in the U.S. Gulf Coast, or PADD 3, rose by
88,000 barrels a day to 3.5 million barrels in January, up from
3.41 million barrels a day in December, the Energy Department
said  yesterday .  “Midland is a bottleneck” because of increased oil
production from the Permian Basin, Mike Mears, chief executive
officer at Magellan Midstream Partners LP, said during an
investor conference in New York. “You are starting to see a
larger-than-historical differential between Cushing crude and
Midland crude.”  The discount for WTI at  Midland (USCSWTIM)  versus the same grade at
Cushing widened $1.05 to $8.30 a barrel at 11:08 a.m.  New York 
time, the widest gap since at least 1991, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The spread narrowed to $8.15 at 2:17 p.m.  Midland is about 483 miles (777 kilometers) by road from
Cushing.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s (USCSLLSS)  premium added 65 cents to $22.25 a
barrel over the U.S. benchmark at 2:17 p.m.  Heavy Louisiana
Sweet (USCSHLSE) ’s premium increased 40 cents to $23.50 a barrel.  Thunder Horse ’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $17.75 a
barrel over WTI, and  Mars Blend (USCSMARS)  increased 15 cents to a premium
of $15.50. Poseidon’s premium was unchanged at $14.65, while
Southern Green Canyon’s dropped 25 cents to $15.10.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened $1 a barrel to $8.30
below WTI.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount was unchanged at $24 a
barrel, Bakken oil’s was steady at $11 and Syncrude’s discount
