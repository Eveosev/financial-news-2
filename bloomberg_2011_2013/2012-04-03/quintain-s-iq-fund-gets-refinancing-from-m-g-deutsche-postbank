Quintain Estates & Development Plc (QED) ’s
iQ Fund, a student accommodation provider, completed 158 million
pounds ($253 million) of debt refinancing with M&G Investments
and  Deutsche Postbank AG. (DPB)   M&G, a unit of  Prudential Plc (PRU) , provided a 115 million-pound
five-year senior loan at an interest rate of 290 basis points
more than the London interbank offered rate, London-based
Quintain said in a statement today. The transaction is secured
on nine of the fund’s 12 buildings.  iQ Fund also got a 42.75 million-pound five-year loan from
Deutsche Postbank that pays an interest margin of 275 to 300
basis points and is secured by the fund’s remaining assets,
Quintain said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The deals will replace iQ Fund’s five-year senior borrowing
with HBOS Plc and Fortis that mature this year, according to the
statement.  iQ Fund is owned by Quintain, an urban regeneration
specialist, and U.K. charity Wellcome Trust Ltd. Each holds 50
percent of the fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
