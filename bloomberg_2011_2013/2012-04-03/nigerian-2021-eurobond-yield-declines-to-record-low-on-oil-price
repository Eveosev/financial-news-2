Yields on  Nigeria ’s dollar-
denominated bonds due 2021 declined to the lowest on record on
higher oil prices.  The yield on the $500 million of Eurobonds of Africa’s
biggest oil producer fell six basis points, or 0.06 percent, to
5.286 percent by 4:24 p.m. in  London , the lowest since the debt
was first issued in January 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Crude oil is trading more than $30 a barrel above the $72
proposed by lawmakers as a benchmark for this year’s budget,
raising expectations of higher foreign reserves and a stronger
naira. Nigerian benchmark  Bonny Light crude  has advanced 15
percent this year.  “Several of the African sovereigns continue to benefit
from high  oil prices ,” Stephen Bailey-Smith, a London-based
emerging-markets strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd., wrote
in an e-mailed report today.  The naira appreciated 0.1 percent to 157.56 per dollar on
the  interbank market  in Lagos, the commercial capital. The
currency of sub-Saharan Africa’s second largest economy has
risen 3 percent this year.  Nigeria  sold  $100 million at a foreign-currency auction
yesterday, the central bank said. Borrowing costs of domestic
bonds due 2015 fell 12 basis points to 15.13 percent yesterday,
according to the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.  “Short-term naira strengthening is likely as a result of
large dollar inflows from foreign investors seeking high
yielding  government securities  and dollar supply from government
agencies,”  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI)  analysts, led by Paris-
based Paul-Harry Aithnard, wrote in a note to clients today.  Foreign Reserves  The West African nation’s foreign reserves advanced 2.6
percent last month to $35.6 billion as of March 30, according to
data compiled by the central bank based in the capital, Abuja.  “This is a welcome increase,”  Leon Myburgh  and Coura Fall, Johannesburg-based Africa strategists at Citigroup Inc.,
wrote in an e-mailed note today. “The higher level of dollar
supply in the interbank market as foreign investors went into
the treasury bill auctions will have contributed to the improved
foreign-exchange reserve data.”  Ghana’s cedi fell 0.4 percent to 1.7835 per dollar as of
3:27 p.m. in Accra, the capital. The cedi has lost 8.1 percent
of its value this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
