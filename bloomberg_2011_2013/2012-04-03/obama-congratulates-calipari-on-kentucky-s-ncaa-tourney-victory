President Barack Obama called
University of Kentucky men’s basketball coach  John Calipari  to
congratulate the team on winning the U.S. collegiate basketball
championship yesterday.  The president told Calipari “that his team played with
class and dignity,” according to a White House statement
describing the call.  Obama also spoke with Kentucky player  Anthony Davis , who
was named the most outstanding player of the tournament’s Final
Four. Kentucky beat the University of Kansas 67-59 for the
National Collegiate Athletic Association’s Division I title.  The White House’s statement in places misspelled the
Kentucky coach’s name as Capilari.  To contact the reporter on this story:
