China , the worldâ€™s largest oilseed
processor, may increase so-called crushing of soybeans by 5.9
percent in the year ending in September, Oil World said.  Processing may rise to 56.3 million metric tons from 53.15
million a year earlier, the Hamburg-based researcher said today
in a report. China will account for about 25 percent of world
soybean crushing in the current period, according to Oil World.
Global processing may gain to 225.5 million tons from 221.5
million a year earlier, it said.  Chinese processing of 10 oilseeds may advance to 85.8
million tons in the current period, or 22 percent of the global
total, from 81.4 million a year earlier, according to Oil World.  To contact the reporter on this story:
