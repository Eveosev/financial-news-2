Dubai’s stocks advanced to the
highest in almost a month led by  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC)  after  Abu
Dhabi ’s  Aabar Investments PJSC (AABAR)  raised its ownership in the Dubai
builder to 10.45 percent.  Arabtec, the United Arab Emirates’ biggest construction
company, surged 15 percent, the biggest increase in more than
three years.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s
tallest tower, rallied to the highest since June. The  DFM
General Index (DFMGI)  jumped 2.4 percent to 1,693.67, the highest since
March 5, at the 2 p.m. close in Dubai.  Aabar Real Estate now owns 5.13 percent of Arabtec,
according to data posted on Dubai’s stock exchange. Aabar
Petroleum Investments Co., which in 2008 sold its energy assets
to state-owned Mubadala Development Co., holds 5.32 percent up
from 5.28 percent last month, the data show.  “The interest of Aabar in Arabtec is now obvious as it
increased its share through Aabar subsidiaries,” said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities. “The
combination of available capital and technical resources will
eventually make Arabtec a winner in the real-estate market on
the local and the international level.”  Arabtec Rally  Arabtec has surged 117 percent this year on speculation
investors are accumulating the stock amid bets it will benefit
from regional infrastructure spending. That compares with a 25
percent gain for Dubai’s benchmark index. Abu Dhabi, home to
about 7 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves, is trying to
diversify away from crude.  Aabar, which owns stakes in  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,
canceled in 2010 a plan to buy most of Arabtec for an estimated
$1.74 billion. It had offered to buy 70 percent of Arabtec
through the purchase of bonds that would be exchanged for shares
at 2.3 dirhams.  Arabtec shares rallied the most since October 2008 to 3.45
dirhams today. A unit of Arabtec won in January a 25-month
contract valued at 561 million dirhams ($153 million) for
expansion works at Dubai International Airport. One of its units
this year also won contracts in Abu Dhabi valued at 256 million
dirhams.  Emaar gained 3.6 percent to 3.18 dirhams, the highest close
since June 21.  Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  advanced 0.3 percent
in its fifth day of gains, Oman’s  MSM 30 Index (MSM30)  rose 0.3 percent
and Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  increased 0.1 percent. Qatar’s
 QE Index (DSM)  and  Kuwaiti (KWSEIDX)  gauge slipped 0.2 percent, while Bahrain’s
 BB All Share Index (BHSEASI)  fell 0.1 percent. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200) 
was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
