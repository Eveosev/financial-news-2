California’s (STOCA1)  most fiscally stressed
cities and counties will face additional pressure from higher
pension contributions because the state’s largest retirement
fund lowered its investment forecast,  Fitch Ratings  said in a
report.  Cities with labor conflicts and limited financial
flexibility are at the “biggest risk” from the March 14
decision by the  California  Public Employees’ Retirement System,
known as Calpers, to reduce its investment-return forecast rate
to 7.5 percent from 7.75 percent, Fitch said today.  Calpers, the largest U.S. pension, lowered its assumed rate
of return after the recession reduced equity and real-estate
prices. The $239.1 billion fund uses the rate to calculate how
much it needs in annual contributions from state and local
governments to cover the cost of benefits.  “Some have already taken steps to reduce labor costs, the
major cost driver for most local governments, through such
methods as furloughs and wage freezes or even reductions,”
according to the report. “This may leave them with little
flexibility to further reduce employee compensation to
accommodate the increase in contributions to Calpers.”  The lower rate of return will add an estimated $167
million, or 4.8 percent, to the $3.5 billion annual retirement
bill just for the state, Alan Milligan, an actuary, told the
board last month. He didn’t estimate the increased cost to local
governments.  For most cities and counties in California, the lower
investment forecast would be a positive for  credit quality  in
the long term, Fitch said.  To contact the reporter on this story: James Nash in  Los Angeles
