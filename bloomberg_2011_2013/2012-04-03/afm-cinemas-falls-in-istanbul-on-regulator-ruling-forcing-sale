AFM Uluslararasi Film Produksiyon &
San AS (AFMAS) , a Turkish chain of cinemas, fell after saying a ruling
by the competition regulator would lead it to sell six of its
cinemas.  AFM dropped 1.8 percent to 13.50 liras at 12:25 p.m. in
Istanbul, declining for the first day in three.  AFM will turn over the cinemas, including four in Istanbul,
to “potential buyers at varying prices within six months”
after the regulator’s decision, the company said in a statement
to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  after the market close yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
