Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest
barley buyer, may increase grain imports by 16 percent in the
2011-12 marketing year on demand for  animal feed , the  United
Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization forecast.  Grain imports will climb to 12.91 million metric tons in
the year through June from 11.16 million tons a year earlier,
the Rome-based FAO wrote in a report on its website today. The
outlook for imports was raised from 12.16 million tons in
October.  Saudi Arabia plans to phase out water-intensive crops
including wheat by 2016, according to the FAO. The country
stopped subsidies for barley production in 2003 to save water.  Wheat imports are forecast to be a record 2.3 million tons,
partly for use in feed to substitute barley and yellow corn in
animal rations, the FAO said. Barley imports are expected to be
7.3 million tons and corn purchases are seen at 2 million tons,
the report showed.  The country’s wheat crop, which will be harvested from the
middle of April, is forecast to drop to 1 million tons from 1.1
million tons in 2011, according to the FAO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
