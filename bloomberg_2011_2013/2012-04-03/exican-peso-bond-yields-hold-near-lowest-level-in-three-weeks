Mexican peso bond yields held near a
three-week low as the central bank’s record level of
international reserves helped bolster confidence in  Latin
America ’s second-biggest economy.  The yield on Mexico’s peso-denominated debt due in 2024 was
little changed at 6.43 percent at 11:12 a.m. in Mexico City,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield was 6.41
percent on March 13. The bonds’ price today dropped 0.01 centavo
to 130.91 centavos per peso. The peso traded little changed at
12.7480 per dollar.  Mexico’s  foreign reserves rose  to $150.3 billion in the
week ended March 30, the central bank reported today. Foreigners
are boosting holdings of Mexican fixed-rate debt in part because
Mexico’s has “a great fundamental, stable story behind it,”
said  Nick Chamie , the head of emerging markets at  RBC Capital
Markets  in Toronto.  “Inflows into  Mexico ’s local bond market remain quite
strong from foreigners,” Chamie said by phone. “That bid for
Mexican fixed income is helping to drive yields lower.”  International investors held 43.8 percent of fixed-rate
government debt on March 23, up from 31.8 percent a year
earlier, according to the most recent data from the central
bank.  The peso touched 12.6980, the strongest level on an
intraday basis since March 28. It has gained 9.5 percent in
2012, the most among the most-traded currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  Orders to U.S. factories rose 1.3 percent in February after
a revised 1.1 percent decline in the prior month, figures from
the Commerce Department showed today in  Washington . Mexico sends
about 80 percent of its exports to the U.S.  “It’s the same story as always about the correlation
between the U.S. and Mexico,”  Ramon Cordova , a currency trader
at Banco Base SA in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico, said by
phone. Trading in the peso is going to be “thin” this week
before the Easter holiday, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
