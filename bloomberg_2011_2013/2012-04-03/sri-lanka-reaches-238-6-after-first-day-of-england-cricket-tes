Captain Mahela Jayawardene’s second
successive Test century pushed  Sri Lanka  to 238-6 at the end of
the first day of the second cricket Test with England in
Colombo.  Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat, but James
Anderson took three quick wickets to reduce the hosts to 30-3.
Jayawardene’s 105 runs stabilized the side before he was trapped
leg-before-wicket by Graeme Swann. He and Thilan Samaraweera
combined for 125 runs.  Angelo Mathews , on 41, and Suraj Randiv,
on 5, were batting at the end of the day.  “Losing 3 wickets up front put us in a difficult place,”
Jayawardene said in a televised interview. He said Sri Lanka was
“30 to 40 runs short” for the day.  England , which must win at the P. Sara Oval to retain the
No. 1 Test ranking, made two changes to the team that lost the
opening Test in Galle by 75 runs as  Steve Finn  and Tim Bresnan
came in for Monty Panesar and the injured Stuart Broad. South
Africa will take the top spot should England fail to win.  Sri Lanka, seeking its first Test series victory since
August 2009, also made two changes. Mathews returned from injury
to replace Dinesh Chandimal and Dhammika Prasad took over from
hurt seamer Chanaka Welegedara.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
