The ruble strengthened against the
dollar for a third day and yields on  Russia ’s dollar-denominated
Eurobonds fell as better-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data
spurred demand for riskier assets.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 29.28 per
dollar as of 10:11 a.m. in Moscow, heading for the strongest
close since March 27. The country’s $3.5 billion of bonds due
2020 rose, pushing the yield down four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.983 percent.  Higher-yielding assets like Russian bonds stand to gain
after the U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
climbed to 53.4 last month from 52.4 in February, beating
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey and signalling improving
growth prospects in the world’s largest economy. Urals crude
oil, Russia’s chief export, rose 1.7 percent to $121.69 per
barrel by yesterday’s close.  The ruble was little changed at 39.0702 per euro and
33.6936 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.
Investors pared bets on the currency weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 29.6604 per dollar in
three months, compared with expectations of 29.7 per dollar
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
