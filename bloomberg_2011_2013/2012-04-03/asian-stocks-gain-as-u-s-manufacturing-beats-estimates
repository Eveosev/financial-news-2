Asian  stocks  rose for a third day as
signs of strength in the world’s two biggest economies, the U.S.
and China, bolstered confidence in the global recovery. Japanese
shares fell as the yen’s appreciation damped the earnings
outlook for the country’s exporters.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , South Korea’s biggest exporter of
consumer electronics, rose 2.8 percent in Seoul after the
Institute for Supply Management’s U.S. factory index rose more
than forecast. Tencent Holdings Ltd., China’s biggest Internet
company, advanced 2.9 percent after a gauge of activity at
mainland service companies rose to a six-month high. Electronics
maker Kyocera Corp. and other Japanese exporters fell after the
yen rose to a three-week high against the dollar.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 0.2 percent to 127.46 as
of 7:52 p.m. in Tokyo, with about the same number of stocks
rising as falling. The measure gained 0.4 percent yesterday,
extending its best quarterly rally since the period ending Sept.
30, 2010.  “Judging from the comments of business people in the ISM
report, the earnings outlook for U.S. companies may improve on
the back of strong domestic demand,” said Hitoshi Asaoka, a
Tokyo-based senior strategist at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co.
“While the Chinese market is closed, people are waiting for the
Fed minutes and jobs data to gauge the possibility of additional
monetary easing.”  U.S., China  Asia’s benchmark equity gauge has risen 12 percent this
year amid optimism the  U.S. economy  will weather  Europe ’s debt
crisis and monetary easing in  Japan ,  China  and Europe will spur
growth. Gains slowed after China last month cut its target for
economic growth as it seeks to cool the property market and
become less dependent on exports.  Korea’s Kospi Index gained 1 percent. Hyundai Motor Co.
gained 6.3 percent to 255,000 won after reporting sales
increased 18 percent last month. Affiliate Kia Motors Corp.
climbed 3.4 percent to 78,300 won.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  added 0.2 percent as the
nation’s central bank kept the benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 0.6 percent.
The MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index gained 0.8 percent.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose 1.3 percent before a
public holiday tomorrow in the city. Trading volume in Hong Kong
was 13 percent below the 30-day average as markets in China were
closed for a holiday and before U.S. economic reports this week.  Volatility Falls  A gauge of volatility on the Hang Seng gauge fell 6.3
percent to 18.53, the lowest since July 22, indicating traders
expect a swing of 5.3 percent on the benchmark gauge over the
next 30 days. Volatility measures for Korea’s  Kospi 200
Volatility Index (VKOSPI)  and Japan’s Nikkei 225 also fell.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.2 percent
today. The index gained 0.8 percent in  New York  yesterday after
the ISM’s survey of factory managers showed business conditions
improved, with the  index  rising to 53.4 in March from 52.4 a
month earlier. Fifty is the dividing line between growth and
contraction.  Stocks also rose after China’s government said an index of
purchasing managers at service companies rose to 58.0 in March
from 48.4 in February. People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou
Xiaochuan said today China’s goal is to gradually reduce
inflation and that the country is using interest rates and other
measures to achieve a soft landing.  Samsung Electronics, which counts China and the U.S. as its
biggest markets, rose 2.8 percent to 1.335 million won. Tencent
advanced 2.9 percent to HK$222.80, and Air China Ltd. advanced
1.9 percent to HK$5.35 in  Hong Kong .  Book Value  Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 1.4 times book
value, compared with 2.3 times for the S&P 500 and 1.5 times for
the Stoxx 600, according to Bloomberg data. A number below 1
means companies can be bought for less than value of their
assets.  Japanese shares fell after the yen touched 81.56 per
dollar, the strongest since March 9. The dollar was buying 83.05
yen at the April 2 close of trading in Tokyo. A stronger yen
cuts the value of overseas earnings when repatriated. The
currency weakened after the Bank of Japan in February set an
inflation goal of 1 percent and decided to buy more  government
bonds .  The rising yen “drags down shares as it has the greatest
impact on manufacturers’ earnings,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , chief
strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co., which oversees the
equivalent of $22 billion. “Investors are beginning to doubt
the BOJ will continue to ease monetary policy.”  Kyocera slid 1.1 percent to 7,540 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
Asia’s biggest carmaker, lost 0.3 percent to 3,555 yen.  Sony
Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics, dropped
0.6 percent to 1,707 yen.  Sun Hung Kai  PT Bank Danamon Indonesia surged 39 percent to 6,400 rupiah
in Jakarta after DBS Group Holdings offered to buy the lender
for about $7.2 billion. DBS, Southeast Asia’s biggest bank,
dropped 2.8 percent to S$13.79.  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16) , the world’s No. 2 real estate
company by market value, rose 2 percent to HK$96.25 in Hong Kong
after the company announced its co-chairmen Raymond and  Thomas Kwok  would hold a press conference today. The billionaire
brothers were arrested last week by the city’s anti-corruption
agency.  The developer is operating as usual, Thomas Kwok said at a
brief press conference after the Hong Kong close.  Raymond Kwok 
denied any wrongdoing at the same event.  To contact the reporter on this story:
