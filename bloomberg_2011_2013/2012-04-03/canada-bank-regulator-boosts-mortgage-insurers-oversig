Canada ’s banking regulator said it
plans to boost oversight of mortgage insurers over the next
three years as part of efforts to monitor emerging risks that
may affect federally regulated financial institutions.  The Ottawa-based Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions, in a “planning and priorities”  document  released
on its website, said it will also produce a report for the
finance minister on “certain matters” related to Canada’s
mortgage insurance guarantee framework.  “Elevated household debt levels not only make households
vulnerable to adverse shocks but continued low  interest rates 
could encourage even higher household indebtedness,” OSFI said
in the planning document.  Policy makers, including Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty ,
have said some housing markets are overheated and some people
are taking on debts that will be unaffordable when interest
rates rise.  Consumers “could become a source of negative domestic
influence if they take action to rein in spending to address
their indebtedness,” OSFI added in its report.  The regulator also said it will work to identify “emerging
macroeconomic and financial-sector risks” in areas  including
residential mortgage portfolios.  A spokeswoman for OSFI, Leonie Roux, said the regulator’s
report would apply to private insurance providers such as
 Genworth MI Canada Inc. (MIC)  and not Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp.,
a government agency. CMHC is responsible for about 70 percent of
mortgage insurance in Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
