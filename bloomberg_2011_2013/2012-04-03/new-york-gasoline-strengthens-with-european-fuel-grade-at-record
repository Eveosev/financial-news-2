New York  gasoline strengthened as
prices for the motor fuel in  Europe  gained to a record and U.S.
inventories are expected to decline.  Eurobob gasoline for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $1,220 a metric ton, according to a
survey of brokers and traders monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board. Total U.S. gasoline inventories probably dropped last
week to a 13-week low, according to the median estimate of 11
analysts in a survey by Bloomberg News.  The premium for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in New York Harbor increased 1.75 cents to
7.75 cents a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:03
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
largest gap since Oct. 13.  The Eurobob trade is the highest price for the grade, which
was introduced in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Total gasoline imports to the U.S. East Coast dropped 16
percent from a week earlier to 496,000 barrels a day in the
seven days ended March 23, Energy Department data show. It’s the
lowest level for this  time of year  in at least a decade.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  widened 1.12 cents to 11 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
