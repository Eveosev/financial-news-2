Solazyme Inc. (SZYM) , which develops oil
products from genetically modified algae, rose the most in more
than four months after announcing a joint venture with  Bunge
Ltd. (BG)  to build a plant in  Brazil .  Solazyme climbed 11 percent to $15.93 at 11:11 a.m. in New
York. Earlier the shares gained 14 percent, the most intraday
since Nov. 16.  The facility will be capable of producing 100,000 metric
tons of oil a year and be built next to Bunge’s Moema sugar-cane
mill, the two companies said in a statement today. It will begin
operating in the second half of 2013 and costs, which weren’t
disclosed, will be split between the companies.  The plant will use Bunge’s sugar-cane supply and technology
developed by South San Francisco, California-based Solazyme to
produce oil that may be sold to the fuel and chemicals
industries, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
