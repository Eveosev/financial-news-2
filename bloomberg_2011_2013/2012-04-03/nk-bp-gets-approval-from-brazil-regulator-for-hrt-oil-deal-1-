TNK-BP,  Russia ’s third-largest oil
producer, gained approval from Brazil’s petroleum regulator to
conclude a $1 billion deal with  HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA 
to explore for oil in the Latin American country.  The regulator, known as ANP, will allow TNK-BP’s local unit
to buy 45 percent of 21 blocks in the Solimoes Basin from HRT,
according to statements from both the Brazilian and Russian
companies.  “TNK-BP’s growth strategy foresees the company’s
transformation into a leading private oil and gas company both
inside and outside of Russia,” TNK-BP’s billionaire Chief
Executive Officer Mikhail Fridman said in the statement.  The approval gives  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Russian venture with a group of
billionaires access to its third strategic area for expansion
abroad after closing deals in Vietnam and  Venezuela . TNK-BP
agreed in October to pay $1 billion for a 45 percent stake in
HRT’s Solimoes block, with an option for an additional 10
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
