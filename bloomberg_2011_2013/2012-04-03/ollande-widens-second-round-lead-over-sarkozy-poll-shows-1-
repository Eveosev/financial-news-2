Francois Hollande ,  France ’s
Socialist presidential candidate, widened his lead over
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  in voting intentions for the second
round of the 2012 election, a BVA poll showed.  Hollande would win 56 percent support if the decisive
second-round ballot were held now, compared with 44 percent for
the incumbent, according to the poll for today’s Le Parisien
newspaper. That’s a 12-point lead for Hollande, compared with
eight points a week earlier.  French voters will chose between 10 candidates for the
first round of the election April 22 and the two front-runners
will face-off in a May 6 ballot. The two candidates are almost
neck-and-neck in first round voting intention with Hollande
leading Sarkozy by 28 to 27 percent of voters, BVA said.  The poll, based on responses from 2,555 registered voters
aged 18 or more, was conducted March 29-31 and has a margin of
error of plus or minus 1.5 points, BVA said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
