A group of 19 Iranian
parliamentarians are seeking to impeach Labor, Cooperatives and
Social Welfare Minister Abdolreza Sheikholeslami after he
appointed an official accused of links to the deaths of
prisoners in custody, the state-run  Fars news agency  reported.  An impeachment motion has been signed and will be submitted
to parliament’s presiding board shortly, lawmaker  Ahmad Tavakoli , who heads the body’s research center, told state-run
Press TV today. Fars, which also published a copy of the motion,
said the document was lodged earlier today.  The move comes after Sheikholeslami appointed former
prosecutor-general Saeed Mortazavi as the head of the country’s
Social Security Organization, Press TV said. Mortazavi was
suspended in 2010 after three men died in the Kahrizak detention
center following their arrest during protests after the 2009
presidential elections, Shargh newspaper reported at the time.  Mortazavi organized the trials of over 140 politicians,
journalists and activists detained during the unrest. Opposition
groups said the election, which led to a second term for
President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was fraudulent.  Impeachment motions need the support of 10 or more deputies
to be placed on the agenda of the 290-member parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
