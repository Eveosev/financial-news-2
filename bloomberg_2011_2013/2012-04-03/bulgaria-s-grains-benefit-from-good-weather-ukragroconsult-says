Bulgaria’s winter grain will benefit
from favorable weather this month, helping spring grain
planting, according to agricultural researcher UkrAgroConsult.  Bulgaria’s wheat is 68 percent in good and very good
condition, based on samples, the Kiev, Ukraine-based researcher
said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday. Barley is 60
percent in good and very good condition, it said.  The country’s grain harvest this year is seen at 7.11
million metric tons, of which 3.6 million tons may be exported,
UkrAgroConsult said a month ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
