Aixtron SE (AIXA) , a German manufacturer of
production equipment for semiconductor and lighting makers, rose
the most in almost two weeks as  Siemens AG (SIE) ’s Osram unit was said
to plan to build a factory in  China  for light-emitting diodes.  Aixtron (AIXA)  rose as much as 3.8 percent to 13.49 euros, the
biggest intraday jump since March 23, and was trading 2.7
percent higher at 1:26 p.m. in Frankfurt. The gain was the
fourth-biggest on the 30-stock TecDAX index of German technology
companies.  Osram is drafting plans for its first plant to manufacture
LEDs in China, two people familiar with the project said. The
facility would fill a gap for Osram in China, the world’s
largest lighting market, where the Munich-based company has no
LED production.  “The news is another piece of evidence that the general
LED lighting market will noticeably increase next year,” said
Tim Oliver Wunderlich, an analyst at Hauck & Aufhaeuser
Institutional Research AG in Hamburg. “Osram is a customer of
Aixtron, so this may well lead to some orders.” Wunderlich
recommends clients buy Aixtron stock and estimates the
Herzogenrath-based company’s shares will rise to 15 euros within
a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
