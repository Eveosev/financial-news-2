economic data.  The Micex Index of 30 shares jumped 1.8 percent to 1,550.05

barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Orders

business equipment. U.S. manufacturing expanded at a faster pace
than economists had estimated last month, a report showed
yesterday and  China ’s non-manufacturing purchasing managers’
index improved in March.  “Manufacturing data from the U.S. was slightly more
positive, but what was more important were the Chinese PMI
numbers,” Doug Rohlfs, an international salesman at UralSib
Financial Corp., wrote in e-mailed comments. “Brent spiking up
and the ruble strengthening has also helped.”  The Russian currency appreciated 0.7 percent to 29.1537 per
dollar, its strongest since March 27  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
climbed yesterday to 53.4 in March from 52.4 in February.

Bloomberg News survey called for a gain to 53.  Quarterly Gain  Russian stocks rallied by 8.2 percent in the first quarter,
