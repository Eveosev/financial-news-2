An oil tanker that ran aground near
Port Arthur,  Texas , refloated under its own power without damage
or pollution, according to its owner.  Two tugs on hand to help the Eagle Kinabalu, a double-
hulled tanker registered in  Singapore , weren’t needed after the
ship was beached on the bank of the Sabine-Neches waterway at
about 6 p.m. local time yesterday, AET Inc. of Hamilton,
Bermuda, said in an e-mailed statement.  “The ship backed off, refloated herself under her own
power, and went to the nearest anchorage,” AET said. The
company “is investigating the cause of the incident together
with the appropriate authorities.”  The Eagle Kinabalu was on its way to sea and the grounding
lasted “momentarily,” AET said.  Calls to the U.S. Coast Guard in  Port Arthur  were not
returned.  The 244-meter (800-feet) tanker “suffered a steering
casualty,”  according to a filing  with the National Response
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
