The Iraqi government awarded two
construction companies contracts valued at $199 million to build
2,000 homes in the southern provinces of Thiqar and al-Muthanna,
two local officials said.  Markez Inc. , an Iraqi-American company, secured a $139
million deal to build 1,000 homes within three years, said Louay
Mousa, president of the Thiqar Investment Commission. Koma Co.
of  Iraq  will build another 1,000 homes in Samawa, the capital of
al-Muthanna, for $60 million, Adil Dakhil, president of al-
Muthanna Investment Commission, said by phone.  Iraq, which holds the world’s fifth-largest oil reserves,
is seeking foreign investment to help rebuild an economy and
infrastructure damaged by years of conflict, sanctions and lack
of investment. In March 2010, the government approved a plan to
build 1 million homes by 2014 for low- and mid-income families
to reduce the country’s housing shortage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
