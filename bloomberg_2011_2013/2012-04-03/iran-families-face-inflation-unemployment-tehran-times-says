Most Iranian families are grappling
with inflation and youth unemployment, the  Tehran Times 
reported, citing Parliamentary Speaker  Ali Larijani .  Support for domestic manufacturing can have an impact on
these difficulties, the newspaper cited Larijani as saying.
Domestic producers havenâ€™t been given sufficient help during
implementation of a governmental plan to phase out energy and
food subsidies, and that must be reviewed, he said.  Larijani said imports of unnecessary goods must be avoided,
the Tehran Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
