Colombia ’s peso advanced to the
highest level in a week as companies bought the currency before
tax payments this month and amid rising investment inflows to
the country.  The peso appreciated 0.4 percent to 1,769.20 per  U.S.
dollar  today in Bogota, from 1,775.66 yesterday. It earlier
touched 1,764.51, the strongest level since March 27. The
currency has rallied 9.6 percent this year in the best
performance among the six most-traded Latin America currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  “We continue to see flows into mining and oil, helping the
peso regain its strengthening trend,” said Omar Escorcia, an
analyst in Bogota at Asesores en Valores, a brokerage.  The peso touched a six-week low on March 29, a day after
Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said the central bank
should consider boosting dollar purchases and study possible
“surprise” moves to halt the currency’s advance.  Central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe said in an  interview 
yesterday with W Radio that the bank’s board members all want a
“more devalued peso” and that measures to ease gains are taken
when the benefit outweighs the costs. To stem the pace of the
local currency’s appreciation, the central bank has said it will
purchase a minimum of $20 million daily in the  spot market  until
at least Aug. 4.  Policy makers get “increasingly uncomfortable” when the
peso nears 1,750 per dollar, Escorcia said.  Colombia’s peso bonds rose for a third day as speculation
inflation slowed last month helped boost demand for the fixed-
rate securities.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 7.21 percent, according to the central bank. The price
rose 0.173 centavo to 122.194 centavos per peso.  Consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in March after increasing
0.6 percent in the previous month, according to the median
estimate of 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The national
statistics agency is due to release the monthly inflation report
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
