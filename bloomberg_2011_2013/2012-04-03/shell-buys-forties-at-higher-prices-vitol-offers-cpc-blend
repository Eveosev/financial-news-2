Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought a
second cargo of North Sea  Forties (EUCSFORT)  crude at a higher price for
loading in the second half of the month, while offers for
earlier shipments were made at a lower differential. Six
consignments of the grade failed to find buyers.  No bids or offers were made for Russian Urals, while Vitol
Group sought to sell a Caspian crude cargo.  North Sea  Shell bought a Forties cargo for loading on April 23 to
April 25 from Trafigura Beheer BV at 40 cents a barrel more than
 Dated Brent (EUCRBRDT) , compared with its purchase yesterday at a premium
of 20 cents for a April 15 to April 17 lot, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
trading window.  Total SA was unable to sell two shipments, with one at a
discount of 10 cents to Dated Brent for April 12 to April 14,
and the other at a premium of 50 cents for April 18 to April 20,
the survey showed.  Trafigura didn’t find buyers for one April 17 to April 19
cargo at 60 cents more than Dated Brent and another at a $1
premium for April 16 to April 23 on the basis of a ship-to-ship
transfer from the tanker Hildegaard, according to the survey.  Vitol sought to sell at 5 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent for April 14 to April 16 without success, while Phibro, a
unit of Occidental Petroleum Corp., failed to sell a shipment
for April 25 to April 27 at 50 cents more than the benchmark or
a premium of 75 cents to the cash cost of  North Sea  crudes for
June, the survey showed.  Reported North Sea trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the
session, Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 40 cents a barrel
more than Dated Brent, compared with a premium of 18 cents
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement traded at $125.50 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, up from $124.13 yesterday. The June contract was at
$124.97, a discount of 53 cents to May.  One cargo of Forties crude with parcel number F0413 will be
delayed for a second time to April 23 to April 25, two people
with knowledge of the export program said.  Mediterranean/Urals  Urals (EUCSURNW)  was at $3.65 a barrel less than Dated Brent,
unchanged from yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Vitol didn’t manage to sell 85,000 metric tons of CPC Blend
for April 16 to April 20 delivery to Augusta in  Italy  at $1.15 a
barrel less than Dated Brent, according to the survey.  Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region is producing about
100,000 barrels of oil a day after cutting off its crude
shipments,  Ashti Hawrami , the region’s minister of natural
resources, said.  West Africa  Bharat Petroleum Corp. is scheduled to award its tender to
buy crude for loading from May 16 to May 31 tomorrow, according
to a document obtained by Bloomberg News. Last month, the
company bought 1 million barrels each of Nigerian Qua Iboe and
Yoho crude for May 1 to May 15 loading from  Exxon Mobil .  Nigeria ’s benchmark  Qua Iboe (AFCSQUA1)  blend was at a premium of
$2.51 a barrel to Dated Brent, down 2 cents from yesterday,
