SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) , the biggest maker of
flash-memory cards, cut its forecast for first-quarter sales,
citing weaker-than-expected pricing and demand.  Revenue in the quarter that ended April 1 will be about
$1.2 billion, compared with an earlier forecast for $1.3 billion
to $1.35 billion. Shares fell in late trading, after the
announcement by Milpitas, California-based SanDisk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
