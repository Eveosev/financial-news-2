Red Sox  relief pitcher  Andrew
Bailey , obtained by Boston in December from the  Oakland
Athletics , will have reconstructive surgery on a ligament in his
right thumb.  The Red Sox said in an e-mailed statement that the surgery
is scheduled for tomorrow. The team did not say when Bailey, a
right-hander, is expected to return.  Bailey, 27, a two-time All-Star, had 75 saves in his three
seasons with Oakland. Bailey converted 24 of his 26 save
opportunities in 2011, a 92.3 percent success rate that was
second highest in the  American League .  The Red Sox got Bailey as part of a five-player trade to
fill the hole left in their bullpen by the departure of  Jonathan
Papelbon , who signed with the  Philadelphia Phillies  as a free
agent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
