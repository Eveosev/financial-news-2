Prime Minister David Cameron
announced the opening of  Big Society Capital , a 600 million-
pound ($1 billion) institution to finance U.K. charities and
community groups, using money from dormant bank accounts.  The institution is being funded with 400 million pounds
from unclaimed assets and 200 million pounds from the U.K.’s
four largest retail banks:  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc (LLOY) ,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. (RBS)  It
will use the money to invest in charitable and social causes
that can make repayments through earned income.  “This is about supplying capital to help society expand,”
Cameron said in a speech at the London Stock Exchange today.
“Just as finance from the City has been essential to help
businesses grow and take on the world, so finance from the City
is going to be essential to helping tackle our deepest social
problems.”  Big Society Capital’s chairman is Ronald Cohen, founding
partner of Apax Partners LLP. Nick O’Donohoe, former global head
of research at JP Morgan, is the chief executive officer.  A  law passed in 2008  under  Gordon Brown ’s Labour government
allows the government to use money from dormant bank and
building-society accounts “for social or environmental
purposes.” An account is dormant if the holder has made no
transactions over a period of 15 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
