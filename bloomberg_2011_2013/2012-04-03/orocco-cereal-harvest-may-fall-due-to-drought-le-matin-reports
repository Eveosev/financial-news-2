Moroccoâ€™s cereal harvest may fall to
3 million metric tons to 4 million metric tons this year because
of the drought, the pro-government daily Le Matin reported
today, citing Agriculture Ministry estimates.  The Moroccan government created an emergency plan to deal
with the effects of the drought, including providing 1.53
billion dirhams ($180 million) to farmers who have lost their
harvest, Le Matin reported. It also plans to keep taxes on
cereal imports, which the newspaper said are at 2.5 percent,
unchanged in the next few weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
