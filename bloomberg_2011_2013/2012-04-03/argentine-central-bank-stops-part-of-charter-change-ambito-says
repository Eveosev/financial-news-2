Argentina â€™s central bank has
temporarily suspended a change to part of its charter that would
require banks to hold reserves at the central bank,  Ambito
Financiero  reported.  Argentine banks can maintain the amount of savings needed
to meet their  reserve requirements  in their own accounts as
previously allowed, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper reported,
citing a statement from the central bank.  The move will help sustain liquidity in the banking system
and keep  interest rates  lower,  Ambito Financiero  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
