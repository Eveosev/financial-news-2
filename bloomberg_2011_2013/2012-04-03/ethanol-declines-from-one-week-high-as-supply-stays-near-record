Ethanol declined from the highest
price in more than a week in  Chicago  amid near-record inventory.  Futures slipped following last week’s Energy Department
report that  stockpiles  totaled 22.6 million barrels in the week
ended March 23, down 0.4 percent from a record 22.7 million. The
fuel is blended with gasoline to stretch supplies and meet
federal mandates.  “We need margins to be negative long enough that we shut
in production or we need stronger exports,” said  Ian Jackson , a
trader at SCB & Associates in Chicago. “Right now, not enough
of either is going on.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery fell 0.4 cent to
$2.281 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures yesterday
reached the highest settlement price since March 23. Prices have
climbed 3.5 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.345 a gallon and in Chicago the additive increased 0.5
cent to $2.265, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf added 0.5 cent to $2.315 a gallon
and on the West Coast the biofuel gained 0.5 cent to $2.385.  To contact the reporter on this story:
