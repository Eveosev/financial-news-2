Turkey ’s central bank plans to
tighten  monetary policy  as a result of increases in energy
prices, according to Mehmet Yorukoglu and other deputy governors
of the bank.  The central bank will probably increase the rate it charges
lenders on ordinary days, when it sets borrowing costs at the
bottom end of its interest corridor, and may also charge more on
the extraordinary days when the price is set toward the top of
the range, according to comments made by Yorukoglu and his peers
at a meeting with economists in Ankara today.  ’’The central bank’s latest steps such as squeezing
liquidity was a step towards this end,’’ Ercan Erguzel,
economist at  Denizbank AS (DENIZ) , said in an e-mailed response to
questions. “The rates were around 7.5 percent on normal days
and the central bank is signalling that the rates can be more
than that.”  Central bank governor Erdem Basci is offering less funding
to banks at the benchmark 5.75 percent rate and more at rates as
high as 11 percent in regular auctions to help stem loan growth,
inflation and the second-biggest current account deficit
globally after the U.S. Turkey imports more than 98 percent of
the energy it consumes and the price of  Brent crude  climbed to
$126.7 per barrel today from $108.7 at the end of last year.
Inflation was 10.4 percent in March, near a three-year high, the
statistics agency said today.  Yields on two-year bonds fell 4 basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 9.34 percent at 5:47 p.m. The lira rose 0.1
percent to 1.7767 per dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
