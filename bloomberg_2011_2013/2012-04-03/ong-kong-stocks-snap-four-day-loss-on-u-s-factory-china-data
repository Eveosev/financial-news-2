Hong Kong   stocks  rose, with the Hang
Seng Index heading for its first gain in five days, as U.S.
manufacturing data beat expectations and a gauge of  China 
service industries improved.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the world’s
largest lender by market value, increased 2 percent.  Li & Fung
Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
climbed 3 percent.  Sun Hung Kai (16)  Properties Ltd. advanced 2
percent as the world’s second-largest real estate company
announced a media briefing after their co-chairmen were arrested
last week by Hong Kong’s anti-corruption agency.  “In a broad sense the world is pretty OK,” Mikio Kumada,
Singapore-based global strategist at LGT Capital Management,
said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “The  U.S. economy  is
improving, Europe is stabilizing and China may avoid a hard
landing.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  added 1.3 percent to 20,790.98 as of
the 4 p.m. close in Hong Kong, with almost four shares rising
for each that fell. Volume on the gauge was about 13 percent
lower than the 30-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The benchmark index declined 3.6 percent in the two
weeks through March 30 as companies including Aluminum Corp. of
China Ltd. missed earnings estimates.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies
increased 1.9 percent to 10,859.49 today. Shares rose after a
survey showed China’s service industry expanded in March on new
orders at retail, information technology and software
businesses.  China Policy  Chinese banks and developers advanced as central bank
Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said policy makers will use  interest
rates  and other measures to gradually reduce inflation and
achieve a soft landing for the world’s second-largest economy.  ICBC, as China’s No. 1 lender is known, gained 2 percent to
HK$5.11.  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288) , the nation’s third-
biggest lender, rose 2.4 percent to HK$3.42.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) , the largest mainland
developer listed in Hong Kong, increased 5.3 percent to
HK$15.84.  Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. (813) , controlled by
billionaire Hui Wingmau, jumped 7.7 percent to HK$8.82.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.1 percent
today. The gauge gained 0.8 percent in  New York  yesterday after
U.S. manufacturing expanded at a faster pace than forecast in
March, a sign that industry is weathering slower global growth.  Exporters and shipping companies advanced. Li & Fung rose 3
percent to HK$17.94. Man Wah Holdings Ltd., the sofa maker that
counts the U.S. as its biggest market, gained 3.5 percent to
HK$4.75. China Shipping Container Lines Co., which gets 36
percent revenue from Trans-Pacific routes, increased 2.9 percent
to HK$2.80.  China Cosco Holdings Co. (1919) , Asia’s biggest container
carrier, advanced 4.1 percent to HK$5.10.  Kwok Denies Wrongdoing  Sun Hung Kai, whose shares tumbled 13 percent on March 30
after co-chairmen Thomas and  Raymond Kwok  were arrested by the
Independent Commission Against Corruption, gained 2 percent to
HK$96.25. In a brief media conference just after the Hong Kong
market closed, Raymond Kwok denied any wrongdoing. His brother,
Thomas, said the company operates usual and that its projects
won’t be affected by ongoing investigations.  Among stocks that declined, Kunlun Energy Co., a gas
supplier controlled by PetroChina Co., sank 3.1 percent to
HK$13.74. The company plans to raise HK$10.8 billion ($1.4
billion) by selling 800 million shares at HK$13 to HK$13.50
each, a discount of as much as 8.3 percent to its closing price
yesterday, according to a term sheet obtained by Bloomberg News.  Cambodia Casino  NagaCorp Ltd. (3918) , operator of a casino in Cambodia, slumped 15
percent to HK$3.06 as Fourth Star Finance Corp. sought to raise
as much as HK$680.52 million by selling shares in the company.
The stock is being offered for HK$3.04 to HK$3.18 per share,
according to a term sheet obtained by Bloomberg.  The Hang Seng Index climbed 12 percent in the first quarter
as signs the U.S. economy is recovering fueled confidence in
exporters. The rally boosted the value of stocks on the gauge to
10.2 times estimated earnings as of yesterday. That compares
with 13.6 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 11.1
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index expiring this month added
1.6 percent to 20,778. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  slipped 7.9
percent to 18.53, the lowest since July 22, indicating options
traders expect a swing of about 5.3 percent in the benchmark
index over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
