Vietnam ’s bonds advanced, with
benchmark five-year yields falling to the lowest level in a week,
on speculation easing inflation will lead to lower  interest
rates . The dong was little changed.  Consumer prices rose 14.15 percent in March from a year
earlier, the slowest pace in a year, according to data released
March 24 by the General Statistics Office in Hanoi.  “There is more demand for bonds as people expect yields
will drop further,” said Do Hoang Quynh Trang, a fixed-income
trader at Hanoi-based Ocean Commercial Joint-Stock Bank.
“Slowing inflation is a factor affecting interest rates.”  The  yield  on the five-year notes fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 11.46 percent, the lowest since March
26, as of 4 p.m. in Hanoi, according to daily fixing prices from
banks compiled by Bloomberg. The dong was little changed at
20,828 per dollar, according to data from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,828 per
dollar, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on
either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
