Companies are showing enough
confidence to pave the way for falling unemployment and rising
stock prices, according to Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup Inc.’s
chief U.S. equity strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY features an indicator he used to draw
the conclusion in a March 30 report: an index of small-business
hiring plans, as compiled each month by the  National Federation
of Independent Business .  The index is compared with the Labor Department’s monthly
jobless rate, which has declined by 1.7 percentage points from a
peak in October 2009. In the chart, the NFIB index is inverted
and the jobless rate is offset by a year for purposes of
comparison. The hiring gauge shows the percentage of Americans
out of work will fall further in the next 12 months, according
to Levkovich.  “Lower unemployment rates lead to broad stock-market
gains,” the New York-based strategist wrote. Financial stocks
tend to rise along with the market, he added, while shares of
homebuilders, retailers and other companies that depend on
consumers’ discretionary spending often fall instead.  Capital spending  is poised to rise with hiring, the report
said, citing data for 735 U.S. companies outside of finance that
Citigroup’s analysts follow. The figures point toward 11 percent
growth in outlays for 2012, exceeding a 6 percent increase seen
earlier this year.  “Business people are hiring and spending corporate cash,”
Levkovich wrote. “Indeed, even fears around rising gasoline
prices have not held them back.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
