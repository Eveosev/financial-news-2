(Corrects to producer from exporter in first paragraph.)  Palm oil  rallied for a second day to
the highest level in more than a year on concern that farmers in
the U.S., the world’s biggest soybean producer, will seed  less 
of the oilseed this year, paring cooking oil supplies.  June-delivery palm oil gained as much as 0.9 percent to
3,566 ringgit ($1,170) per ton on the  Malaysia  Derivatives
Exchange, the highest price for the most-active contract since
March 9, 2011, and ended the morning session at 3,550 ringgit in
Kuala Lumpur.  Farmers will sow 73.902 million acres with soybeans this
year, down 1.4 percent from 2011 and the lowest in five years,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said March 30 after surveying
growers. The forecast was about 1.5 million acres below the
average estimate of analysts and almost 1.1 million less than a
year earlier. Soybeans can be crushed to make  soybean oil , which
competes with palm oil for use in food and fuel.  Palm oil “prices are tracking soybeans,” James Ratnam, an
analyst at TA Securities Holdings Bhd., said by phone from  Kuala
Lumpur . “Further upside would come if there are any surprise
shocks from the soybean side.”  Soybeans for May delivery were little changed at $14.1975 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures reached $14.3375
yesterday, the highest for the most-active contract since Sept.
7. Prices surged 16 percent in the first quarter, the most since
the end of 2010, after dry weather reduced output in South
America. Soybean oil for delivery in May was also little changed
at 56.18 cents per pound after closing 1.9 higher yesterday.  Demand for palm oil was “quite strong” as shown by the
export data from Malaysia, said Ratnam.  Exports from Malaysia, the second-largest producer,
increased 3.5 percent to 1.21 million tons in March from a month
earlier, surveyor  Societe Generale  de Surveillance said
yesterday. Shipments rose 4.8 percent to 1.23 million tons,
surveyor  Intertek (ITSPALM)  said March 31.  Markets in  China  are closed for a holiday today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
