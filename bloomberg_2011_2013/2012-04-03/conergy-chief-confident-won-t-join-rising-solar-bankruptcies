Conergy AG (CGYK) , a German solar panel
maker, said it’s confident it can avoid joining the wave of
bankruptcies in the country’s photovoltaic industry.  Conergy has been owned by creditors since July after a
debt-to-equity swap and restructuring measures that resulted in
“initial positive effects,” Chief Executive Officer Philip Comberg said. The Hamburg-based company expects to generate
positive first-quarter net cash flow for the first time since
2005, he said.  “Despite the continuing difficult market environment we
remain carefully optimistic for 2012,” Comberg said in an e-
mailed statement.  Conergy has been cutting jobs and halting production of
wafers and cells to focus on end-product modules, project
development in non-German markets and services in a bid to
become profitable. The company is targeting markets in  North
America  and Asia to drive future growth, Antje Stephan, a
spokeswoman, said today by phone.  German solar companies are struggling with reduced state
aid and competition from Chinese companies led by Suntech Power
Holdings Co. that have expanded capacity, creating a glut in
solar panels. Conergy’s peer  Q-Cells SE (QCE) , once the largest solar-
cell maker, said it plans to file for insolvency as early as
today.  Solon SE (SOO1) ,  Solar Millennium AG (S2M)  and  Solarhybrid AG (SHL)  all
filed for insolvency in the past four months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
