Terex Corp. (TEX) , a maker of cranes and
construction equipment, hired about 500 workers at two
Washington plants during the first quarter to meet demand from
customers replacing aging machinery.  “This is a replacement market,”  Ron DeFeo , chief
executive officer of the Westport, Connecticut-based company,
said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “InBusiness with
Margaret Brennan.”  The company hired the workers at its Redmond and Moses Lake
plants, which manufacture so-called aerial work platforms that
are used to lift workers in the construction, utility and bridge
maintenance industries, Tom Gelston, a Terex spokesman, said in
a telephone interview. The hirings were made to meet rising
demand from customers wanting delivery between March and
September, Gelston said.  Terex’s aerial work platform unit’s global workforce was
cut by about half to about 3,000 in 2010 from 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
