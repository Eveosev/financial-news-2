Manhattan apartment prices dropped
in the first quarter as new buyers seeking refuge from rising
rents drove purchases of lower-cost studios and one-bedroom
units to a two-year high.  The median price of all condominiums and co-ops that
changed hands in the three months ended March 31 fell 0.9
percent from a year earlier to $775,000, New York appraiser
 Miller Samuel Inc.  and broker  Prudential Douglas Elliman  Real
Estate said in a report today. Deals totaled 2,311, down 3.5
percent from the first quarter of 2011.  Studios and one-bedrooms accounted for 56 percent of sales
completed in the quarter, the highest share since the last three
months of 2009, when first-time purchasers qualified for a
federal tax credit of as much as $8,000, according to  Jonathan Miller , president of Miller Samuel. The smaller units, favored
by entry-level buyers, accounted for 49 percent of all
transactions a year earlier.  “Because the rental market is so hot, people are realizing
that maybe buying a starter home is a better option, especially
if they can take advantage of these low  interest rates ,” said
Sofia Song, vice president of research at property-listings
service  StreetEasy.com , which also released a report on the
Manhattan sales market today.  Among pending sales -- contracts signed but not completed
in the first quarter -- studio deals climbed 19 percent from a
year earlier, according to StreetEasy. Buyers agreed to purchase
12 percent more one-bedroom units than in the first three months
of 2011.  Rents Approach Peak  The median effective rent for Manhattan apartments, or what
tenants paid after landlord-sponsored incentives, rose 9.5
percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier to $3,121 a
month, according to Miller Samuel and Prudential. Rents averaged
$3,376 in February, $18 less than the market peak in May 1997,
data from New York brokerage Citi Habitats show.  The average interest rate for a  30-year fixed  U.S. home
loan fell to 3.87 percent in February, the lowest in Freddie Mac
records dating to 1971. The rate was 4 percent or lower for all
but one week in the first quarter, according to the McLean,
Virginia-based mortgage financier.  For Katharine Tuckerman, a message from her landlord pushed
her into homeownership: The rent for the Midtown apartment she
had leased since 2009 would be raised “significantly” come
June. Tuckerman decided that it might be time to buy.  “I’ve seen everything that was out there for rent and none
were as nice as if I had just bought something,” she said.  Cheaper Than Leasing  Tuckerman, 28, a sales associate at brokerage Brown Harris
Stevens, set out to find a building with low maintenance fees so
that her entire monthly burden would be no more than $2,500. She
considered three options before choosing an 800-square-foot (74-
square-meter) co-op on East 66th Street. She put down 50 percent
of the $575,000 purchase price and borrowed the rest at a rate
of less than 4 percent. After a gut-renovation of the kitchen
and bathroom, she plans to move in this week.  Her monthly payments, including mortgage and maintenance,
are $2,200 -- “less than I would have to pay for a rental the
same size, for sure,” she said.  Other reports issued today on the Manhattan apartment
market showed mixed results for sales and values in the first
quarter.  Corcoran Group  said purchases of condos and co-ops
totaled 2,700 deals, little changed from a year earlier. The
median price climbed 1 percent to $809,000.  StreetEasy  said the median price was unchanged at $775,000,
while completed deals climbed 9.4 percent to 2,969.  Luxury Properties  Brown Harris Stevens  and its sister brokerage,  Halstead
Property LLC , both reported a median price of $821,500, up 4
percent from the first quarter of 2011. The gain was spurred by
an increase in sales of properties priced higher than $10
million, said Gregory Heym, chief economist at Terra Holdings
LLC, which owns the two firms. There were 17 deals in that
range, up from 12 a year earlier, according to Brown Harris and
Halstead.  Purchases of luxury apartments, defined as the top 10
percent of all sales by price, declined 3.3 percent to 231
deals,  Miller Samuel  and Prudential said. The median price of
those transactions climbed 4.4 percent to $4.13 million.  On the Upper East Side, the median price of previously
owned co-ops climbed 7 percent to $890,000 from a year earlier,
according to Corcoran. Condo prices in the neighborhood declined
17 percent to a median $1.06 million. On the Upper West Side,
the median price of co-op resales dropped 4 percent to $669,000,
while condo resale prices climbed 28 percent to $1.23 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
