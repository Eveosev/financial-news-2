U.S. regulators barred a Chicago
exchange from allowing trades in derivatives tied to the outcome
of the 2012 U.S. elections, deciding that the transactions would
constitute gambling and undermine the public interest.  The  North American Derivatives Exchange  sought to offer
contracts tied to the outcome of the elections and whether
Democrats or Republicans would control the U.S. House, Senate
and White House. The U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission ,
which regulates futures contracts tied to wheat, oil, natural
gas and other commodities, said yesterday that it ordered the
exchange not to list election contracts for clearing or trading.  “We felt strongly that these products met all legal and
regulatory criteria for listing, and that the public would
benefit from having these products traded on a well-regulated
exchange,” Tim McDermott, general counsel at Nadex, said in an
e-mailed statement.  The company said the contracts would have allowed traders
to take an economic position on the election’s consequences for
 tax policy  and other issues. The company said existing political
events contracts, allowed by the CFTC to trade on the  Iowa
Electronic Market , an academic project of the University of
 Iowa , have offered accurate predictions of election outcomes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
