     April 3 (Bloomberg) --Investment banking fees posted their
third consecutive quarterly decline in the first quarter, the
longest contraction since 2008, as the biggest sovereign debt
restructuring in history crimped dealmaking worldwide.  Revenue from arranging mergers, stock and bond sales and
loans fell 14 percent to $19.39 billion in the first quarter of
2012 from $22.43 billion a year earlier, according to estimates
from New York-based research firm Freeman & Co. The shrinkage
was exacerbated by a 19 percent fall in first-quarter fees in
 Europe , the  Middle East  and  Africa  to $4.91 billion, the lowest
since the same period in 2004.  “We should have seen the lows in the first quarter,”
Stefan Bongardt, a banking analyst at Independent Research in
 Frankfurt , said today by phone. “Sentiment in Europe has
improved and a pipeline is picking up, indicating that fees
should pick up by the third and fourth quarter.”  Concern that  Greece  would default on its debt roiled credit
markets and deterred company executives from acquisitions,
curbing earnings at securities firms. At  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,
 Germany ’s biggest financial-services firm, fourth-quarter profit
fell 76 percent as its investment bank posted a 422 million-euro
pretax loss ($563 million). Fourth-quarter profit at  UBS AG (UBSN) ,
 Switzerland ’s largest bank, also dropped 76 percent as its
investment bank recorded a pretax loss of 256 million Swiss
francs ($284 million).  Companies in Europe, the Middle East and Africa slowed
dealmaking, according to the Freeman estimates. Fees from
mergers and acquisitions fell 35 percent to $1.57 billion in the
first quarter of 2012 from a year earlier. Income from
syndicated loans declined 30 percent to $748 million.  The biggest announced transaction in Europe in the first
quarter was Glencore International Plc’s 22 billion-pound ($35
billion) bid for  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  in February, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
