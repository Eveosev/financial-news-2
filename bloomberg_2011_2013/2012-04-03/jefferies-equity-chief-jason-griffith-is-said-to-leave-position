Jason Griffith,  Jefferies (JEF)  Group
Inc.’s global head of equities, is leaving his position,
according to two people briefed on the situation.  Jefferies has informed employees of the move, said one
person, declining to be identified because the decision hasn’t
been announced publicly. Griffith didn’t respond to messages
today seeking comment.  Jefferies hired him in 2006 and promoted to him to co-head
equities withRoss Stevens a year later, eventually giving
Griffith sole oversight of the division. In this year’s fiscal
first quarter, Jefferies’s equity-trading revenue slid 23
percent to $136.2 million from a year earlier, accounting for 17
percent of the company’s net revenue. Average daily equity
trading on major U.S. exchanges fell 9.9 percent.  Richard Khaleel, a spokesman for the New York-based firm,
said he couldn’t comment.  Griffith was hired in 2006 as co-head of equity products to
help oversee Jefferies’s expansion in electronic-trading
services and equity financial products, including derivatives,
according to a statement at the time. He was previously head of
U.S. structured-product sales at  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA after the
Paris-based bank acquired  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s structured-
investments business.  Jefferies has climbed 39 percent this year through
yesterday. The stock slipped 0.7 percent today to $18.92 as of
12:50 p.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
