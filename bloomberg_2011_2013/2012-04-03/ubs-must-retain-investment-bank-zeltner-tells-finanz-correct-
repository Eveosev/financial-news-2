(Corrects spelling of name in headline)  UBS AG (UBSN)  must retain a global
investment bank alongside its worldwide asset management
business,  Juerg Zeltner , head of  wealth management  at the bank,
told  Finanz & Wirtschaft .  “Why should UBS farm out client orders?” the Swiss
newspaper quoted Zeltner as saying. “Without an investment bank
we would have to replicate one. Other banks would gladly take
business from us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
