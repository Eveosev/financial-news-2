Japanese  stocks  declined, sending
the  Topix (TPX)  Index to a three-week low, after the yen’s rise to its
highest in three weeks against the dollar overshadowed stronger-
than-forecast growth in U.S. manufacturing.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , an electronic components maker that gets
more than half of its sales outside Japan, lost 1.1 percent.
Mitsubishi Estate Co. sank 3.1 percent after the property
company surged 26 percent this year through yesterday.  Mitsui
Chemicals Inc. (4183)  gained 3.3 percent after Jefferies Group Inc.
raised its rating to “buy.”  The strengthening yen “drags down shares as it has the
greatest impact on manufacturers’ earnings,” said  Masaru
Hamasaki , chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co., which
oversees the equivalent of $22 billion.  The Topix slid 0.6 percent to 851.02 at 3 p.m. in  Tokyo ,
its lowest close since March 13, with almost three times as many
shares declining as advancing. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell
0.6 percent to 10,050.39, with trading volume on the gauge more
than 30 percent lower than the 30-day average.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The gauge gained 0.8 percent in  New York 
yesterday after manufacturing in the U.S. expanded at a faster
pace than forecast in March, a sign that industry is weathering
slower global growth.  The yen reached as high as 81.56 against the dollar today,
compared with 83.05 at the close of  stock trading  yesterday.
Japan’s currency strengthened to 108.70 against the euro this
morning from 110.76. A stronger yen cuts overseas income at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  Kyocera fell 1.1 percent to 7,540 yen. Mazda Motor Corp., a
carmaker that gets more than 75 percent of its revenue overseas,
lost 2.1 percent to 143 yen.  Money Supply Falls  Stocks also dropped after the Bank of  Japan ’s liquidity
supply dropped in March for the first time in more than three
years, fueling complaints that the central bank should be doing
more to end deflation. The  monetary base  fell 0.2 percent in
March after climbing 11.3 percent from a year earlier in the
previous month, a BOJ report showed today.  ‘Investors are beginning to doubt the BOJ will continue to
ease monetary policy and are unsure it will promote reflation,”
Toyota Asset’s Hamasaki said.  The  Topix (TPX)  has risen 8.2 percent since Feb. 14, when the
central bank increased its bond purchases, weakening the yen.
The  value  of stocks listed on the index has risen to 1.05 times
book value, up from 0.88 in December, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. A number below one means companies can be bought
for less than value of their assets.  Developers Drop  Developers (TPX)  declined the most among the 33 Topix industry
groups after gaining the most on the equity gauge in the last
month. Mitsubishi Estate sank 3.1 percent to 1,448 yen. Mitsui
Fudosan Co., which has risen by a third this year, slid 2.3
percent to 1,558 yen.  “From the beginning of this year, developers gained quite
a lot, so I think investors are selling the shares to lock in
profit,” said  Masahiro Mochizuki , a Tokyo-based analyst at
Credit Suisse Group AG.  Mitsui Chemicals gained the most in the Nikkei 225, rising
3.3 percent to 252 yen. The stock rose after Jefferies boosted
its investment rating to “buy” from “underperform,” citing
petrochemical companies’ favorable inventory cycle and rising
product prices.  Citizen Holdings Co. added 1.8 percent to 521 yen after
JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised its stock price estimate to 620 yen
from 600 yen, saying the watch business will likely continue to
grow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
