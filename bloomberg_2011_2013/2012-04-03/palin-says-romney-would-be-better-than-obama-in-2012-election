Sarah Palin said  Mitt Romney  is a
better choice for Americans than the re-election of President
Barack Obama.  “Anybody but Obama,” Palin, the former Alaska governor
who was the Republican candidate for vice president in 2008,
said in an interview on NBC’s “Today” show, where she is
serving as a guest host today. “America would be better off
with any of them,” referring to all four of the Republican
candidates. While not endorsing the former Massachusetts
governor, Palin said Romney “does obviously seem to be the
front-runner.”  She also said the  U.S. economy  may be improving “for those
on Wall Street” but “not for the millions still unemployed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
