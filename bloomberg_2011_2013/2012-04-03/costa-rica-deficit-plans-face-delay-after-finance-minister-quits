The resignation of  Costa Rica ’s
Finance Minister Fernando Herrero may delay a congressional vote
on tax changes aimed at paring a $2 billion fiscal deficit, said
 Boris Segura , strategist at Nomura Securities in New York.  Herrero submitted his resignation to President Laura Chinchilla yesterday following allegations by the La Nacion
newspaper that he underpaid taxes for 12 years. In a statement
last week, he denied deliberately evading taxes.  “The main issue is if his resignation is going to impede
the tax reform approval,” said Segura in a phone interview from
Costa Rica. “It will likely cause some further delays.”  Drafted last year by Herrero and Chinchilla’s government,
the tax package would add about $650 million a year to
government revenue to narrow a deficit currently valued at more
than 5 percent of gross domestic product, according to the
 Finance Ministry . Changes include replacing the 13 percent sales
tax with a 14 percent value-added tax and imposing a 15 percent
tax on dividends paid by companies that enter the country’s
free-trade zones after 2015.  Herrero said in a statement that he resigned to protect
Chinchilla’s government and so that “my name won’t be used as
an obstacle to the great transformations we dreamed of.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
