Estonia’s  Finance Ministry  raised
its 2012 inflation forecast as  oil prices  exceed its estimates,
reducing its outlook for consumer-price growth in 2013.  Inflation (ESCPLYOY)  will probably average 3.3 percent this year,
compared with a September forecast of 2.8 percent, the ministry,
based in the capital, Tallinn, said today in a new economic
outlook. Consumer-price growth may slow to 3 percent next year,
compared with a previous estimate of 3.1 percent.  Rising oil prices are triggering upward revisions to
official inflation forecasts, Finance Minister Juergen Ligi said
last week. Growth in the $19 billion Baltic economy may slow to
1.7 percent this year from 7.6 percent in 2011, the European
Union’s fastest pace, as the euro region’s debt crisis saps
export demand, Ligi said. It may quicken to 3 percent in 2013,
he added.  Price growth in the year to February averaged 5 percent,
the second-fastest rate in the 27-member EU behind  Romania .
Persistently high global fuel prices affect the newest euro-area
member more than most European countries because of its lower
incomes and northern location, according to the central bank and
the Finance Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
