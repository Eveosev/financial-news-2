Most coffee-growing areas in  Brazil ,
the world’s largest producer, will have dry weather this week,
according to forecaster Somar Meteorologia.  No rain is forecast for producing regions of Sao Paulo
state, northern Parana and southern  Minas Gerais , Marco Antonio dos Santos, an agronomist at Somar, said in a report e-mailed
yesterday. Other growing areas will get only between 10
millimeters (0.4 inch) and 20 millimeters, the Sao Paulo-based
forecaster said.  “The weather has gone back to being dry in the past few
days,” dos Santos said, adding that the lack of rain left soil
drier. Dryness this week will result in “new reductions in soil
moisture,” he said.  Coffee prices may gain if the weather in Brazil remains dry
“in coming months,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report
e-mailed March 28. Arabica beans traded in  New York  fell 20
percent in the first quarter. Reduced soil moisture has left
many beans below average weight, according to Somar.  Harvesting of the 2012-13 crop in Brazil will likely start
in the second week of May, dos Santos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
