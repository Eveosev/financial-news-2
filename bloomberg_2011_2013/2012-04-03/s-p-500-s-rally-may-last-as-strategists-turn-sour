Wall Street   strategists  cut their
recommended holdings in U.S. equities to almost the lowest level
since 1998, a sign that the six-month stock rally may have more
room to go, according to Bank of America Corp.  Strategists advised investors to reduce equity allocations
in six out of the past eight months, with money earmarked to
stocks falling to 55.8 percent in March. The level was the
lowest since January 1998, except for the seven months ended
July 2009, and compared with a 15-year average of 60.7 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Bank of America.  Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative
strategy at Bank of America, said the decline in recommended
stock holdings signaled rising pessimism that she considers as a
contrarian indicator because investors who have sold shares now
have more money to purchase stocks.  “We take some comfort in Wall Street’s lack of optimism,”
Subramanian wrote in a note yesterday. “It has historically
been a bullish signal when Wall Street was extremely bearish.”  Wall Street strategists turned sour on stocks as the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  surged 29 percent through yesterday
from its 2011 low in October. Shares rallied as economic data
beat economists’ forecasts and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said he will keep  interest rates  low through at least
late 2014 to spur growth.  Subramanian said a balanced portfolio would allocate 60
percent to 65 percent of its money to stocks, as suggested by
benchmark indexes. The recommended stock holdings had stayed
below 65 percent since at least 1985 until 2000, data from Bank
of America show. The S&P 500 surged almost 15-fold during the 20
years through 1999 before peaking in 2000.  Strategists’ bullishness exceeded 65 percent again in 2007.
That year, the  S&P 500  reached its all-time high of 1,565.15 on
Oct. 9. The reading fell to 51.6 percent in March 2009, the
lowest level since 1997. The S&P 500 reached a 12-year low that
month and has since rallied 110 percent to 1,419.04 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
