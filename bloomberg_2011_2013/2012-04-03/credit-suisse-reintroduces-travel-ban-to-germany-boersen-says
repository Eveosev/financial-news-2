Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  reintroduced
a ban at the start of this month on client advisers traveling to
Germany, Boersen-Zeitung reported, without citing anyone.  The ban was initially implemented in early 2010 and since
rescinded, the German newspaper said. The risk of Swiss bankers
being targeted when visiting clients in Germany has risen amid a
spat relating to  tax evasion  and stolen client data, Boersen-
Zeitung said, citing an unidentified banker.  Bjoern Korschinowski, a Frankfurt-based spokesman for
Credit Suisse, declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg
News today.  Switzerland is seeking to arrest three German tax
investigators who negotiated the purchase of data on Credit
Suisse clients for economic espionage, a German government
spokeswoman said on March 31. The tax investigators from the
state of North Rhine-Westphalia negotiated the 2.5 million-euro
($3.3 million) purchase of personal information of clients of
Credit Suisse who may have evaded taxes in  Germany  in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
