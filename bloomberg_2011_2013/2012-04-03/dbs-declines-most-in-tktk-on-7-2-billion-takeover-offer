DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS)  fell the
most in six months after  Southeast Asia ’s largest lender offered
to buy  PT Bank Danamon Indonesia (BDMN)  for about $7.2 billion
yesterday in the region’s biggest banking deal.  Shares of the Singapore-based bank slid as much as 3.9
percent, the biggest intraday decline since Oct. 4, to S$13.63.
They traded 2.4 percent lower at 9:19 a.m. local time after
being suspended yesterday when the offer was announced. The
benchmark  Straits Times Index (FSSTI)  rose 0.5 percent.  DBS, controlled by Singapore’s state-run  Temasek Holdings
Pte (TMSK) , said it will pay its parent 45.2 trillion rupiah ($4.9
billion) in new shares for its 67 percent stake in Danamon and
buy the remaining stock from others for 21.2 trillion rupiah in
cash. The offer for these shares, at 7,000 rupiah each, is at a
52 percent premium from Danamon’s 4,600 rupiah close on March 30.  “Investors who don’t want to deal with the immediate
complexities of the deal may want to move out,” said Anand Pathmakanthan, an analyst at Nomura  Singapore  Ltd. He predicted
a downward move of at least 5 percent before trading started.  The deal will help DBS branch out from Singapore and  Hong
Kong  and tap  Indonesia ’s economy, which last year grew at the
fastest pace since before the Asian financial crisis. Trade and
infrastructure project finance as well as corporate and retail
banking are among promising areas in Southeast Asia’s biggest
economy, DBS Chief Executive Officer  Piyush Gupta  said yesterday.  Sixth-Largest Bank  The acquisition of Indonesia’s sixth-largest bank will cost
DBS about 66.4 trillion rupiah if all Danamon shareholders
accept the offer. DBS said the deal is expected to close in the
second half of the year, subject to regulatory approvals.  “There are approvals to be got, and other regulatory
issues, so I won’t be surprised if some investors switch out
altogether or buy into other Singaporean banks,” Pathmakanthan
said.  Following the takeover, Temasek’s stake in DBS will
increase to 40.4 percent from 29.5 percent, the lender said.  Danamon’s 3,000-branch network serves 6 million customers.
The Indonesian economy grew 6.46 percent last year, the most
since before the Asian crisis in 1997. It is forecast to grow
6.5 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
