German stocks  declined for the first
time in three days as reports showed U.S. factory orders climbed
less than forecast and Spain’s public debt will rise to a record
this year.  Phoenix Solar AG (PS4)  tumbled to its lowest price since 2004
after saying that legislation cutting solar subsidies forced it
to postpone its results and refinancing talks.  Q-Cells SE (QCE)  rose
7.9 percent after the state of Saxony-Anhalt said it may help
the company to restructure.  The  DAX (DAX)  Index fell 74.37, or 1.1 percent, to 6,982.28 at
the close in Frankfurt as General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co.
reported U.S. vehicle sales that trailed projections. The gauge
has still  rallied 18 percent this year  amid optimism that the
euro area’s leaders would contain the region’s sovereign-debt
crisis and as U.S. economic releases exceeded estimates. The
broader HDAX Index retreated 0.9 percent today.  “Markets are tending slightly lower, which is not merely
due to a moderate miss in factory orders but rather due to far
rather disappointing car sales,” said Markus Huber, head of
German sales trading at ETX Capital in  London .“Ford posted a
slight miss while General Motors posted rather disappointing
figures, missing estimates by a wider margin.”  German stocks have posted their best start to a year
compared with U.S. equities since 2006. The  DAXK Index (DAXK) , a German
equities gauge that strips out gains from dividends, has surged
19 percent in 2012 after sinking to the cheapest valuation in at
least six years last year. That’s the largest advance since 1998
and 6.3 percentage points more than the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index’s increase, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Volume Falls  The volume of shares trading hands on the DAX was 23
percent lower than the 30-day average today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Orders to U.S. factories  rose 1.3 percent after a revised
1.1 percent decline in January, figures from the Commerce
Department showed today in  Washington . The  median of 60
economists’ projections  in a Bloomberg News survey had called
for a 1.5 percent advance.  GM sales rose 12 percent to 231,052, while Ford deliveries
advanced 5 percent to 222,884 cars and light trucks. The average
of 10 estimates was for a 19 percent gain at GM and 5.5 percent
at Ford. Chrysler, controlled by Fiat SpA, said its U.S. sales
climbed 34 percent to 163,381 and Nissan’s sales sales rose 5
percent to 136,317, exceeding predictions.  Spanish Debt, Unemployment  Spain ’s debt will reach 79.8 percent of gross domestic
product this year, up from 68.5 percent last year, the
government said in its budget today. The yield on Spain’s 10-
year bonds climbed 10 basis points to 5.45 percent.  Registered unemployment  in Spain, where more than half of
young people are out of work, rose for the eighth month in March
as the government deepened spending cuts and the economy slipped
back into a recession. The number of people registering for
jobless benefits increased by 38,769 to 4.75 million, the Labor
Ministry in  Madrid  said today.  Phoenix plunged 30 percent to 91.9 euro cents, dropping for
a seventh day. The builder of solar-power plants said it will
postpone its 2011 results “most likely for a few weeks.”
Phoenix added that financing talks were delayed because of
 Germany ’s cuts to feed-in tariffs for solar power.  Solar Millennium  Solar Millennium AG (S2M)  tumbled 15 percent to 10.8 euro cents
after rallying 25 percent yesterday. Utz Claassen, the company’s
former chief executive officer, is suing the German company, its
U.S. subsidiary and Solar Trust of America LLC for $265 million
in damages, Solar Millennium said.  Claassen alleges that Solar Millennium company officers
harmed his professional reputation with statements they made
after he left the company in March 2010, according to a
statement that didn’t identify the company officials.  Solarworld AG (SWV) ,  Germany’s biggest maker of solar panels ,
dropped 8.4 percent to 2.24 euros.  Wacker Chemie AG (WCH) , the second-
largest maker of solar-grade silicon, fell 3 percent to 62.76
euros.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  fell 3 percent to 36.40
euros and 3.4 percent to 1.85 euros, respectively, as bank
shares led declines on the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.  Bayer Motoren Werke AG, the biggest maker of luxury cars,
fell 1.8 percent to 67.99 euros.  K+S Downgrade  K+S AG, Europe’s largest potash maker, fell 1.4 percent to
39.42 euros. The stock was downgraded to reduce from neutral at
Nomura Holdings Inc.  Hochtief AG, Germany’s largest construction company, slid
1.6 percent to 45.83 euros as construction shares declined.  Q-Cells (QCE)  surged 7.9 percent to 13.6 euro cents after the
stock tumbled 41 percent yesterday. The German solar-cell maker
filed for insolvency with the Dessau-Rosslau court today, said
Frank Straube, a spokesman for the state court of Saxony-Anhalt.  The government of Saxony-Anhalt may help Q-Cells to
restructure, Mitteldeutsche Zeitung reported, citing an
interview with Jens Bullerjahn, the state’s finance minister.
Prime Minister Reiner Haseloff had previously ruled out any
assistance, according to the newspaper.  Grenkeleasing AG (GLJ) , which buys and leases computer equipment,
soared 7.6 percent to 48.50 euros. The company said new business
in the first quarter rose 25 percent to 238.3 million euros
($318 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
