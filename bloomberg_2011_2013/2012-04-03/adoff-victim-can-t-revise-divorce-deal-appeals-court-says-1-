A  New York  real estate lawyer who
paid his ex-wife $2.7 million of the supposed value of his
account with  Bernard Madoff  can’t revise the agreement because
he lost money in the Ponzi scheme, a state appeals court ruled.  The New York Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court,
today dismissed a suit brought by Steven Simkin against his
former wife, Laura Blank, reversing the decision of a  Manhattan 
appellate court, which had said the case could proceed.  Simkin, chairman of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &
Garrison LLP’s real estate department, sued Blank in February
2009, saying she was unjustly enriched by their 2006 divorce
settlement. A trial-level judge in Manhattan dismissed the
complaint in December 2009, and the intermediate appellate court
later reinstated the suit.  Judge Victoria A. Graffeo of the Albany-based Court of
Appeals wrote in today’s ruling that Simkin could have redeemed
all or part of the investment until Madoff’s  Ponzi scheme  began
to unravel in late 2008, more than two years after the division
of property was completed.  “This situation, however sympathetic, is more akin to a
martial asset that unexpectedly loses value after dissolution of
a marriage,” Graffeo wrote. “The asset had value at the time
of the settlement but the purported value did not remain
consistent.”  Madoff Account  Simkin and Blank separated in 2002 after almost 30 years of
marriage and divorced in August 2006. Simkin agreed to pay Blank
$6.25 million in the settlement, including $2.7 million from an
account with Madoff that was valued at $5.4 million as of
September 2004, according to the ruling.  Madoff pleaded guilty in 2009 to running what prosecutors
say is the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. He is serving a 150-
year sentence in federal prison in  North Carolina . A trustee is
liquidating Madoff’s firm in federal court in New York.  The case is Simkin v. Blank, 101501/2009, New York State
Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
