Kakuzi Ltd. (KKZI) , a Kenyan tea and fruit
producer, headed for a more than one-month high after reporting
profit in the year through December jumped 67 percent and a
larger dividend.  The stock rose 0.6 percent to 80 shillings as of 2:21 p.m.
in Nairobi, heading for its highest close since March 1,
