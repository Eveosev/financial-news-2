Spanish bonds fell, snapping a two-
day gain, as the nation prepared to sell as much as 3.5 billion
euros ($4.67 billion) of government debt tomorrow.  Spain ’s securities led losses among the region’s higher-
yielding debt after a report showed unemployment increased last
month, adding to concern the nation will struggle to cut its
 budget deficit . Italian and Portuguese bonds also declined,
while German bunds were little changed. The European Financial
Stability Facility and  Belgium  auctioned bills today.  “The market is pricing in a concession ahead of tomorrow’s
supply,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income strategist at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in London. “There’s a need to cheapen the
bonds, given the constant drip of downbeat data and the worries
about the extent of the fiscal challenge.”  The yield on Spain’s 10-year bond rose 10 basis points, or
0.1 percentage point, to 5.45 percent at 5 p.m.  London  time. The
5.85 percent security due January 2022 fell 0.77, or 7.70 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 102.96. Two-year yields rose six
basis points to 2.54 percent.  The number of people registering for jobless benefits in
Spain increased 38,769 in March to 4.75 million, the Labor
Ministry said today. The nation’s debt will reach 79.8 percent
of gross domestic product this year, up from 68.5 percent last
year, the government said in its 2012 budget plan.  Spain will auction notes due between January 2015 and
October 2020 tomorrow.  ‘Fiscal Backdrop’  “Spain’s selloff is related to tomorrow’s supply,” said
Eric Wand, a fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc
in London. “The market is content to factor in a concession,
especially in light of current concerns around the Spanish
fiscal backdrop. The auctions should provide some indication of
how easy or difficult they will find it to raise money in this
environment.”  Spain will get external aid from European authorities and
the  International Monetary Fund  this year to help overcome its
debt crisis, while retaining the ability to raise funds through
bond sales, Citigroup Inc. analysts Ebrahim Rahbari and
Guillaume Menuet wrote today in a note to clients.  The nation’s 10-year yield dropped in December and January,
reaching a 16-month low of 4.83 percent on March 1, as the
 European Central Bank  offered unlimited three-year loans to the
region’s financial institutions through its so-called longer-
term refinancing operations.  ‘Losing Momentum’  “The LTRO effect is losing momentum,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income strategist at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt .
“We’d expect some concession with Spanish paper cheapening as
investors try to squeeze out every basis point they can.”  Italian bonds declined even as Development Minister  Corrado Passera  denied a Financial Times report that the country may
need further budget adjustments to reach its targets.  Italy’s 10-year yield rose five basis points to 5.16
percent after reaching 5.32 percent on March 30, the highest
since Feb. 29.  Portuguese (GSPT2YR)  two-year notes fell for a fourth day, the
longest losing streak since October. The yield rose 14 basis
points to 9.98 percent.  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., wrote that a voluntary
exchange of Portuguese debt by the private markets “seems
inevitable” in a message posted on Twitter today.  Bill Sale  Portugal  plans to sell 192- and 556-day bills tomorrow,
while Germany is scheduled to auction as much as 4 billion euros
of five-year notes. The ECB will leave its benchmark  interest
rate  unchanged when it meets to decide monetary policy in
Frankfurt, according to 57 economists in a Bloomberg poll.  The EFSF sold 1.98 billion euros of three-month bills at an
average yield of 0.112 percent, compared with a rate of 0.052
percent at a previous auction on March 6. Investors bid for 2.35
times the amount allotted, versus 1.98 times last month.  The yield on the EFSF bond due July 2021 fell four basis
points to 2.84 percent.  Germany ’s 10-year  bund yield  was unchanged at 1.8 percent.
The two-year rate fell one basis point to 0.2 percent.  The German  two-year  yield is consolidating below its 100-
day moving average at 0.245 percent and around its 50-day moving
average at 0.223 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It may find support at the March 13 high at 0.19
percent, with resistance at the February high of 0.289 percent.  German bonds returned 0.3 percent last quarter, their worst
performance in a year, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Portuguese bonds gained 13 percent, the biggest
advance among 26 sovereign markets tracked by the indexes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
