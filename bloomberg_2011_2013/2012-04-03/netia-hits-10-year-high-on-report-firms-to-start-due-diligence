Netia SA (NET) , Poland’s second-largest
fixed-line phone company, soared to the highest level in more
than 10 years after Reuters reported three private equity firms
will start due diligence on the company.  The shares gained 3.3 percent stronger as of 4:11 p.m. in
Warsaw, the highest intraday level since November 2001.  Innova Capital Sp. z o.o. is among the three private equity
companies, one of which is linked to mobile-phone operator Play,
that will study Netia’s financials after Easter, Reuters
reported today, citing two unnamed sources.  Netia’s spokesman, Karol Wieczorek, declined to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
