Tata Global Beverages Ltd. (TGBL) , the
maker of Tetley tea and a unit of  India ’s second-largest
industrial group, got regulatory approval to buy out its Russian
tea unit from a partner in that country.  Russia’s Anti-Monopoly Service allowed the Indian company’s
Kahutara Holdings unit to raise its stake in Suntyco Holding
Ltd. to 100 percent from 51 percent, according to a  document  on
the regulator’s website.  Suntyco sells more than 45 percent of the tea and freeze
dried coffee in Russia, Vedomosti said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
