Formosa Plastics Group ’s four
biggest units reported lower-than-expected first-quarter profits
because of increased costs and the Taiwan government’s control
on fuel prices.  Oil refiner  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  posted a pretax
profit of NT$4.87 billion ($165 million) in the three months
ended March 31, down 76 percent from NT$20.1 billion a year
earlier, its parent said in a statement today. The average of
four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was NT$5.32
billion. Plastics processor  Nan Ya (1303)  Plastics Corp. reported a
profit of NT$1.7 billion, missing the NT$4.82 billion analysts
estimated.  Crude oil rose in the first quarter on U.S. economic
recovery and sanctions targeting  Iran , increasing costs for
refiners and petrochemical makers. Taiwan’s government
restricted fuel-price gains by state-run CPC Corp. to stall
inflation, eroding profit margins of the refiner and Formosa
Petrochemical, which followed its larger peer in price changes.  “Formosa Petrochemical didn’t make much money from oil
products in the first quarter,” said Max Chan, a Taipei-based
analyst at Capital Securities Corp. with a “buy on weakness”
rating on the stock. “Petrochemicals rose, but costs rose
more.”  Chemical producer  Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp. (1326)  posted a
pretax profit of NT$3.67 billion in the first quarter. The
average of five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was
NT$6.02 billion.  Polyvinyl chloride maker  Formosa Plastics Corp. (1301)  posted a
pretax profit of NT$5.43 billion, less than the NT$8.19 billion
average of two analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on the story:
