higher price.  Gasoline barges advanced to a record in northwest Europe.
Gasoil moved into contango for the first time in four days on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  Light Products  Gasoline (MOGEEURB)  for immediate loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp advanced to as much as $1,220 a metric ton, according to
a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board. The previous record for gasoline of equivalent quality
was $1,216 in July 2008, data from Argus Media show.  Trafigura Beheer BV purchased at least 9,000 tons of the
20,000 tons that changed hands. Vitol Group and Morgan Stanley

finished fuel that’s sold at the pump.  Premium unleaded traded at $1,210 to $1,220 a ton,
according to a similar survey of the Platts pricing window which
ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Those prices are for barge lots,
usually of 1,000 or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s  crack , or premium to  Brent crude , rose to $13.56
a barrel from $13.47 yesterday, according to data from PVM Oil

$5.50 yesterday, PVM data show.  Vitol bought a cargo of naphtha from Trafigura at $1,079 a
ton, the survey of Platts showed. That compares with a March 28
deal at $1,058.  Middle Distillates  PetroChina bought 30,000 tons of diesel from Royal Dutch
Shell Plc at a premium of $33 a ton to April gasoil, priced for
delivery to Iskenderun in  Turkey , according to the Platts
survey. That compares with yesterday’s deal at a $31 premium for
delivery to the French port of Lavera.  Diesel  barges  traded at premiums of $23.50 and $24 a ton to
April gasoil, the survey showed. That compares with deals
yesterday at $23 to $25.  A barge of  jet fuel  changed hands at $76 a ton more than
April gasoil, the survey showed. Air France-KLM sold to Shell.
That compares with March 30 trades at a $73 premium.  A  gasoil barge  traded at a discount of $1.75 a ton to April
futures, it showed. That compares with yesterday’s deals at
discounts of $2 and $2.50.  Gasoil for April delivery increased 0.5 percent to
$1,029.75 a ton on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange as of 5:16
p.m. London time. The May contract was at $1,030.75 a ton,
moving the two contracts into a market structure known as
contango. That can signal falling demand or rising supply.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability, shrank
to $13.32 a barrel from $13.42 yesterday. Brent crude fell 0.3
percent to $125.10 a barrel.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  changed hands from $704.50 to $707.50
a ton, according to the survey of Platts. That compares with

as the manager of France’s strategic stockpiles is known, has
yet to take delivery of the diesel it purchased in February,
according to an official.  “As of the beginning of April, no delivery has been
made,” Jean-Marc Tenneson, executive officer of  France ’s Comite
Professionnel des Stocks Strategiques Petroliers, or CPSSP as
the body which controls Sagess is known, said today by phone
from Paris.  Sagess issued a tender in February for 350,000 cubic meters
of diesel, or 295,750 tons, to be delivered to the southern
French port of Lavera from March to June to cover the nation’s
strategic inventory requirement by July 1, Tenneson said. Two
companies won the tender, he said, declining to reveal their
identities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
