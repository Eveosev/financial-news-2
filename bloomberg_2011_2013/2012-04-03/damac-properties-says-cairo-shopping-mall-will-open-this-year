Damac Properties Co., a Dubai-based
developer that filed an arbitration lawsuit against  Egypt  last
year, said its shopping mall in Cairo is due to open by the end
of the year.  Park Avenue’s 657 stores are being fitted out by retailers,
Niall McLoughlin, Damac’s senior vice president, said by phone
today. “We will be targeting the fourth quarter for
operations.”  The shopping center will also have 84 offices, which are
still under construction, McLoughlin said. The 120,625 square-
meter (1.3 million square-foot) project will also include 2,050
parking spaces, the closely held company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Damac filed an arbitration lawsuit in Washington in May
2011 after the Egyptian government seized land the company
purchased in 2006 and sentenced Chairman Hussain Sajwani to five
years of hard labor. An Egyptian court stripped the developer of
30 million square meters of land on the Red Sea coast amid legal
challenges to land deals made under President  Hosni Mubarak , who
was ousted in February 2011 after 30 years in power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
