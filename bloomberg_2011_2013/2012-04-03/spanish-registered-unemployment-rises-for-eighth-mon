Registered  unemployment  in  Spain ,
where more than half of young people are out of work, rose for
the eighth month in March as the government deepened spending
cuts and the economy tipped back into a recession.  The  number  of people registering for jobless benefits
increased by 38,769 to 4.75 million, the Labor Ministry in
Madrid said in an e-mailed statement today. That compares with a
median estimate of 54,000 in a Bloomberg News survey of three
analysts.  Spain, home to almost  a third  of the euro regionâ€™s
unemployed, is implementing the deepest budget cuts in at least
three decades while the economy suffers its second recession
since 2009. Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , whose government
announced spending cuts and tax increases for companies last
week, expects the economy to contract 1.7 percent this year,
pushing unemployment to 24.3 percent.  Spain already has the highest jobless rate in the European
Union at 23.6 percent, EU data showed yesterday. Among young
people that figure is  50.5 (U<25ES)  percent, the most on record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
