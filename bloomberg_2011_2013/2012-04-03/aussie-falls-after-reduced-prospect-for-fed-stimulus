The Australian dollar fell versus
the U.S. currency after the  Federal Reserve  said it’s holding
off from increasing monetary stimulus.  New Zealand ’s dollar declined against the greenback as the
Fed said it won’t undertake asset purchases, known as
quantitative easing, unless economic expansion falters or prices
rise slower than 2 percent, signaling less additional liquidity
to buoy higher-yielding assets. Global stocks and commodities
declined.  The Australian dollar slumped 0.8 percent at 5 p.m. New
York time yesterday when it fell as much as 1.1 percent, the
largest intraday decline since March 22. It rose 0.1 percent to
85.56 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar fell 0.6 percent to 81.89 U.S. cents.
The so-called kiwi rose 0.4 percent against the yen.  The MSCI World Index of stocks declined 0.6 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI  Index (MXWO)  of 24 raw materials dropped 0.4
percent.  The minutes of the Fed meeting released yesterday show
decreased urgency to add monetary stimulus. At their January
meeting, a few members of the Federal Open Markets Committee
said that current economic conditions “could warrant the
initiation of additional securities purchases before long.” In
last month’s meeting, no sentiment was expressed for additional
easing without a deterioration in conditions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
