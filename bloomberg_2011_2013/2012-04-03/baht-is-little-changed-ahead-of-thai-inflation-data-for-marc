Thailand ’s baht halted a two-day
rally as data showed inflation accelerated last month for the
first time since October.  Consumer prices  climbed 3.45 percent from a year earlier on
higher oil prices, the Ministry of Commerce said today. That
compared with a 3.35 percent increase in February and a median
estimate of 3.20 percent in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Inflation pressure is “still benign” compared with neighboring
countries, Yanyong Phuangrach, the permanent secretary for
commerce, said at a briefing in Bangkok today. Consumer-price
gains will remain “well within our target of between 3.3
percent and 3.8 percent” this year, he said.  “The inflation data, although higher than expected, is
within expectations given the flood-related stimulus,” said
Leong Sook Mei, the Singapore-based regional head of global
currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. “It’s safer
to say rates will remain unchanged given the uncertainties of
 oil prices  and tail risks in  Europe .”  The baht traded at 30.82 per dollar as of 3:49 p.m. in
Bangkok, compared with 30.83 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency advanced as much as 0.2
percent to 30.77 earlier. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of foreign-exchange swings used to price options, was
steady at 4.52 percent. Local financial markets will be closed
on April 6, April 9, April 13 and April 16 for public holidays.  Oil prices have climbed 5.7 percent this year to $104.47 a
barrel in  New York .  The yield on the 3.25 percent government bonds due June
2017 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.71
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
