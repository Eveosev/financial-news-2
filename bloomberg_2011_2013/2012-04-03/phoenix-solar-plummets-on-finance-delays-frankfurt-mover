Phoenix Solar AG (PS4) , which develops
solar  power plants , fell to a record today in  Frankfurt  after
the company said refinancing talks were delayed by
“considerable” subsidy cuts in core markets.  Phoenix Solar slid as much as 30 percent, to 91.9 euro
cents, at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading today. The Sulzemoos,
Germany-based company said in a statement late yesterday it
would postpone its 2011 report “most likely for a few weeks.”  German solar businesses are struggling with reduced state
aid and competition from Chinese companies led by Suntech Power
Holdings Co. that have expanded capacity, creating a glut in
solar panels. The lower house of parliament in Germany, the
second-biggest market for the industry in 2011, last week backed
legislation to cut solar subsidies by as much as 29 percent
starting this month.  Germany ’s photovoltaic suppliers expect sales to drop as
much as 22 percent on average this year, the VDMA machine-
makers’ association said. Sixty-two percent of the companies
surveyed said they plan to dismiss workers, VDMA said yesterday.
Germany’s  Q-Cells SE (QCE) , once the largest solar-cell maker, filed
for insolvency today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
