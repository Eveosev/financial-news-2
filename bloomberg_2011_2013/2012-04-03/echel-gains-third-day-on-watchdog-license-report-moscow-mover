OAO Mechel (MTLR) ,  Russia ’s largest
producer of coal for steelmakers, rose a third day after a
watchdog declined to pull licenses for the company’s Southern
Kuzbass unit, according to RIA Novosti.  Mechel (MTLR)  advanced as much as 3.4 percent and traded up 2.9
percent at 276.60 rubles at 2:55 p.m. in Moscow.  The Subsoil Resources Agency, known as Rosnedra, is still
waiting for materials on license violations at Mechel’s
Yakutugol, deputy head Vladimir Bavlov told the news service.  Separately, international lenders may agree to increase
rates for Mechel 50 basis points in exchange for letting the
company breach previously-agreed financial covenants,  Luis
Saenz , chief executive officer of the U.S. unit of Moscow-based
brokerage Otkritie Financial Corp. said in a note today, citing
Debt Wire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
