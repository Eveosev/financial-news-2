Asian currencies rose for a third
day, led by gains in  India ’s rupee and South Korea’s won, after
manufacturing growth in the U.S and  China  beat forecasts,
buoying demand for the region’s assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index reached a three-
week high after the U.S. Institute for Supply Management index
of factory output climbed to 53.4 last month from 52.4 in
February, more than the median estimate of 53 in a Bloomberg
News survey. A Chinese purchasing managers’ index touched a one-
year high, data showed April 1. Reports this week may show
inflation accelerated last month in  Taiwan  and the  Philippines .  “The U.S. and China data are supportive of risk-on
sentiment in markets,” said Roy Teo, a currency strategist at
ABN Amro Private Bank in Singapore. “Inflation remains elevated
in the short term and we think it’s prudent for  Asia  to maintain
some currency strength.”  The won strengthened 0.5 percent to a two-week high of
1,121.85 per dollar at the close in Seoul, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The rupee appreciated 0.5 percent to
50.62 as of 2:47 p.m. in Mumbai, Malaysia’s ringgit gained 0.3
percent to 3.0472 and Taiwan’s dollar advanced 0.1 percent to
NT$29.48.  The Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY) , which tracks the region’s 10 most-
used currencies excluding the yen, reached 117.25, the highest
level since March 12. Its 60-day historical volatility fell to
3.34 percent from 3.36 percent. The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of
shares advanced for a third day.  Investment in Malaysia  China’s non-manufacturing index rose to 58 last month, the
highest level since May, the Beijing-based National Bureau of
Statistics and Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today.
The world’s second-largest economy may have grown 8.4 percent
last quarter, according to National Development and Reform
Commission Vice Chairman  Zhang Xiaoqiang .  South Korea ’s currency strengthened for a third day, its
longest winning streak in a month.  “The won is gaining as data showing the economy is
recovering in the U.S. supports stocks,” said Hong Seok Chan, a
Seoul-based currency analyst at Daeshin Economy Research
Institute.  The ringgit climbed to a three-week high. Private
investment in Malaysia by companies including Carrefour SA and
General Electric Co. grew 13 percent to 94 billion ringgit ($31
billion) in 2011, Prime Minister Najib Razak said in a televised
address yesterday.  Indonesia’s rupiah was little changed at 9,123 per dollar
after falling as much as 0.4 percent amid concern faster
inflation will erode demand at an auction of 6 trillion rupiah
($657 million) of government bonds today.  Consumer prices in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy rose
3.97 percent in March from a year earlier, compared with 3.56
percent in February, the statistics bureau said in Jakarta
yesterday. Bank Indonesia will continue to monitor and intervene
in the currency market to stabilize the rupiah, according to a
statement posted on its website on March 8.  Elsewhere, the Philippine peso was little changed at 42.692
per dollar and the Thai baht climbed 0.1 percent 30.81. China’s
yuan rose 0.06 percent to 6.3073 in  Hong Kong , with onshore
financial markets closed for a public holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
