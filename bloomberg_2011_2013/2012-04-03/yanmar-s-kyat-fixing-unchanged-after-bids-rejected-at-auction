Myanmar’s central bank kept the
daily  reference rate  for the kyat at 818 per dollar after
rejecting all bids at a currency auction today, according to a
statement on its website.  The Southeast Asian nation adopted a managed float for its
currency yesterday, scrapping a 35-year-old fixed-exchange rate.
The nation held elections on April 1 that will pave the way for
the end of economic sanctions.  The Central Bank of Myanmar received a total of 14 bids at
805 kyat to 814 kyat per dollar, and the authority purchased
$20,000 at the auction at an exchange rate of 818 kyat.  The currency will be allowed to move as much as 0.8 percent
either side of the reference rate, a central bank official, who
declined to be identified, said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
