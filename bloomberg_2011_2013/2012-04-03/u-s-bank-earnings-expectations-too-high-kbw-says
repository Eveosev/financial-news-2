First-quarter earnings at U.S. banks
may miss “exceedingly high expectations” of investors and
stall gains in financial stocks, analysts at KBW Inc. said.  While KBW expects a “strong quarter” for the so-called
universal banks, which include  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,
 Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS) , “year-
over-year comparisons are very challenging,” David Konrad,
Andrew Del Medico and Brian Finneran wrote yesterday to clients.  KBW’s universal banks advanced more than 40 percent  this
year  as an improvement in the  U.S. economy  and the mortgage
servicing settlement with state attorneys general boosted
investor confidence and expectations, the analysts wrote.
JPMorgan could set a “high bar” in the three months ended
March 31 as improvements in trading, mortgage banking and
continued loan growth aid profit, they wrote.  “Are expectations too high? We believe the answer is
yes,” the analysts wrote. “The stocks will face near-term
headwinds following the actual results in April.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
