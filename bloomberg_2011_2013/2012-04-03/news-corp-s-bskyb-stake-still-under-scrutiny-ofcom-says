News Corp. still faces regulatory
scrutiny over its 39 percent stake in  British Sky Broadcasting
Group Plc (BSY)  amid a U.K. phone-hacking scandal, even after  James
Murdoch  stepped down as chairman of the pay-TV company.  With Murdoch, News Corp.’s deputy chief operating officer,
remaining a board member of BSkyB, media watchdog Ofcom will
continue to investigate his role, alongside that of the biggest
shareholder.  “We continue to gather evidence which may assist us in
assessing whether BSkyB is and remains fit and proper to
continue to hold its broadcast licences,” Ofcom said today in
an e-mailed response to questions. “The licensee, as a
corporate body, will include controlling directors and
shareholders.”  Ofcom, which has the ability to revoke a broadcaster’s
license, set up a special team to scrutinize  News Corp. (NWSA)  after
reporters of its U.K. publishing unit hacked into sources’
phones and bribed police for stories. James Murdoch, son of News
Corp. Chief Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch, previously oversaw
News Corp.’s U.K. publishing unit News International.  Senior independent director Nicholas Ferguson will replace
Murdoch as BSkyB chairman, the pay-TV broadcaster said today.
Murdoch will remain a non-executive director of BSkyB.  The phone-hacking scandal prompted News Corp. to drop a 7.8
billion-pound ($12.5 billion) bid to buy all of BSkyB last year
and close the News of the World tabloid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
