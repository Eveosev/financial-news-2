  U.K. stocks  declined, following the
biggest two-day rally for the FTSE 100 Index since January,
after U.S. factory orders missed forecasts and concern grew
about Spain’s economy.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and Lloyds Banking Group
Plc paced European banks lower as Spanish bond yields climbed.
 Compass Group Plc (CPG)  lost 1.8 percent after Morgan Stanley
downgraded the caterer.  Cairn Energy (CNE)  Plc paced advancing shares,
rallying 4 percent, after agreeing to buy Agora Oil & Gas AS to
expand in the North Sea.  The FTSE 100 slid 36.55, or 0.6 percent, to 5,838.34 at the
close in London. The gauge climbed 2.3 percent over the previous
two days after U.S. manufacturing data expanded at a faster-
than-forecast pace. The FTSE All-Share Index slipped 0.5 percent
today, as did Ireland’s ISEQ Index.  “Today’s session can be summed up as a mild bout of profit
taking,” said  Angus Campbell , head of market analysis at
Capital Spreads in  London . “Any prospect of a meaningful gain
was wiped out when U.S. factory orders disappointed.”  The U.S. Commerce Department report showed  factory orders 
climbed in February by 1.3 percent after a revised 1.1 percent
decline in January. That missed the median economist forecast
for a 1.5 percent gain in a Bloomberg survey.  In the U.K., the British Chambers of Commerce said the
economy will probably avoid a recession this year. Gross
domestic product rose 0.3 percent in the first quarter after a
0.3 percent drop in the last three months of 2011, the lobby
group forecast today. The BCC estimated full-year growth of 0.6
percent, less than the 0.8 percent forecast by the government’s
fiscal watchdog.  ECB Loans  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  has rallied 4.8 percent this year, boosted by
the European Central Bank’s 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) in
loans to the region’s financial institutions. The volume of
shares changing hands today was was 12 percent less than the
average over the past 30 days, Bloomberg data show.  Banks declined across  Europe  today as the yield on Spain’s
10-year bonds climbed 10 basis points to 5.43 percent. Spanish
unemployment rose and the government said its debt will reach
79.8 percent of gross domestic product this year, up from 68.5
percent last year.  “Fears over Spain were reignited following their
unemployment numbers as investors fret over an important euro-
zone economy that has just gone back into recession,” said
Campbell. They are “fast becoming the most likely candidate to
require the next bailout.”  RBS Retreats  RBS, Britain’s biggest state-owned lender, slid 3.1 percent
to 26.89 pence,  Lloyds (LLOY)  fell 2.7 percent to 33.68 pence and
Barclays Plc dropped 2.6 percent to 230.35 pence.  Man Group Plc (EMG) ,
the world’s largest publicly traded hedge fund manager, slipped
2.4 percent to 130.1 pence.  Elsewhere, Compass Group declined 1.8 percent to 659 pence,
falling for the first time in five days. Morgan Stanley
downgraded the world’s largest catering company to equal weight,
the equivalent of hold, saying valuations look “fair to full.”  Old Mutual Plc also retreated as Credit Suisse Group AG
lowered its recommendation for the insurer to neutral from
outperform, citing limited restructuring opportunities in 2012.
The shares fell 1.8 percent to 159.9 pence.  Redrow Plc (RDW)  led housing-related companies lower, falling 2.3
percent to 126 pence as Oriel Securities Ltd. lowered its
recommendation for the homebuilder to hold from buy. The
brokerage also downgraded  Persimmon Plc (PSN)  and  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  to
hold and cut Rightmove Plc to sell.  Taylor Wimpey fell 1.7 percent to 51.2 pence, Persimmon and
Rightmove lost 1.5 percent to 635 pence and 0.9 percent to 1,449
pence respectively.  Cairn Climbs  Cairn Energy gained 4 percent to 333.2 pence, rising for
the first time in nine days. The energy explorer agreed to buy
Agora, a Norwegian company owned by RIT Capital Partners Plc and
financier  Jacob Rothschild , for an enterprise value of $375
million and net working capital of $75 million. Cairn will pay
43 percent in cash and 57 percent in shares.  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN)  gained 3.9 percent to 269.1
pence, the highest since 2001 as Morgan Stanley named the
company as a “core pick” among European money managers. The
analysts cited “better relative growth and scope for higher
payouts and raised their price estimate for the shares by 21
percent to 314 pence.  Hays Plc (HAS)  advanced 1.2 percent to 86.3 pence after Bank of
America Corp. boosted its recommendation for the recruitment
company to buy from neutral.  Quintain Estates & Development Plc (QED)  climbed 4 percent to
39.5 pence after the company concluded the 158 million-pound
($253 million) refinancing of its IQ Fund, a provider of student
