Mozambique  set up a team of
officials from the finance and mineral resources ministries to
propose how to calculate taxes on gains on the sale of shares or
companies, national mines director Eduardo Alexandre said.  “We started on the exercise two months ago,” Alexandre
said by phone from the capital, Maputo. “We have to finish it
as soon as possible and incorporate it into the revised mining
law, which is currently under debate.”  The proposal will establish guidelines on how much a 
company pays to the nation’s government when it sells shares 
or the whole company, he said, declining to say when the 
proposal would be ready.  Mozambique is home, along with Tanzania and  Kenya , to the
biggest natural-gas discoveries in a decade. It's reviewing
petroleum and mining laws as it looks to benefit from higher
commodity prices.  Eni SpA (ENI)  and  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  found gas
under the ocean off Mozambique, while Vale SA, the largest 
iron-ore exporter, and  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  have coal assets there.  To contact the reporter on this story:
