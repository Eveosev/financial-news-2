In a related set of developments in the Indian capital of New Delhi last week, major roads were  cordoned off or clogged  for hours (a dangerous thing given the red-blooded Delhi driver's reputation for road rage), Tibetan residents (and others mistaken for Tibetans) were rounded up and detained -- and economists, foreign-policy analysts and naysayers came crawling out of the woodwork (or its cyberspace equivalent). The occasion was the  fourth summit of BRICS , the annual conclave of the world's major developing economies --  Brazil ,  Russia , India, China and, since 2010,  South Africa . In the narrowest interpretation, revealing man as  homo economicus  -- as a rational and self-interested actor, empirically proven to be too often focused on short-term gains and losses -- the BRICS summit made me late for a dinner party on Wednesday last week. But there was much more to it than that. As Brahma Chellaney wrote in the Hindustan Times, in a piece titled (yes, what else?) " BRICS in the wall ": Impressive numbers, to be sure. But do they represent an aggregate mathematically significant but politically inconsequential? After all, we're not talking sums here, but of the power of a group to advance what its members see as their joint interests. And there we face a riddle. Chellaney also pointed out: The summit was presided by Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  of India and the presidents of the other four countries, who between them came up with something called " The Delhi Declaration ." The prose in this capacious document was characteristically joyless, as collaborative and diplomatic writing tends to be ("We do not support plurilateral initiatives that go against the fundamental principles of transparency, inclusiveness and multilateralism"). More importantly, the thinking was, at least to my eye, not particularly ambitious, hobbled somewhat by the clashing foreign-policy positions of the major countries in the group, on issues such as the civil war in Syria, whose regime is supported by China and Russia. The summit's actors enjoined the Western powers to act responsibly in  Syria , Iran, Afghanistan and Palestine without criticizing any one in particular, and demanded "that the Heads of IMF and  World Bank  be selected through an open and merit-based process." No signs here yet of a new world order developing, unless one reads the line "We express our strong commitment to multilateral diplomacy with the  United Nations  playing a central role in dealing with global challenges and threats" as a critique of unilateral action by the U.S. Even here, the following sentence "In this regard, we reaffirm the need for a comprehensive reform of the UN, including its  Security Council " provides much food for thought,  China  being one the powers unwilling to endorse  India's bid for a permanent seat  (and thereby veto power) on the Security Council. The summit's most interesting decisions in the realm of concrete action were the signing of an agreement to promote  intra-BRICS trade  in local currencies to challenge the monopoly of the  U.S. dollar , and to propose the setting up of a development bank to mobilize resources within the bloc. There was also material of interest in  Singh's speech , particularly his admission that: Among the most perceptive reactions to the summit's work was that provided by Ashok Malik, who wrote on  Yale Global Online : Of course, it was lost on no one that China was comfortably the most powerful player in the group, and that it could use the summit to advance its own interests much better than the other members. "On their part, of course, the BRICS members are watching their own backs, looking out for the growing giant, China," wrote Malik. And in a skeptical piece in the New York Times,  Jim Yardley  wrote about the tension between the two biggest powers: Indeed, almost the biggest grouse in the Indian press about the summit was the way that the government went out of its way to remove all traces of  protest against the Chinese occupation of Tibet  by Delhi's vociferous and politically engaged Tibetan population, a move  applauded by the Chinese delegation . To some commentators, this hospitality was almost too generous; what the Indian government should have done was hold its own on its stance on  Tibet . In a piece called " The Price of Minding Mr. Hu's Delicate Sensibilities ," Nitin Pai took the measure of arguments for and against the Indian approach, concluding: Pai's observations were consistent with those made by Mihir Sharma in a sharply critical piece in the  Business Standard , except that Sharma also made the criticism, trivial in a foreign-policy context but crucial in a personal one, that "the Chinese delegation at the Oberoi ate all the mutton chops at the lunch buffet." The jury, then, is still out on the validity of BRICS as an idea and its potential as a force fragmented by respective political ideologies and economic structures. But it would appear from this small survey that what the world press emphatically endorses at present is the appeal of BRICS as a pun-generator for headlines.
