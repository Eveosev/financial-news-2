Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW
brand, helped by a redesigned 3 Series sedan and a March sales
increase of 18 percent, finished the first quarter with 36 more
deliveries than  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz in the U.S.  Sales gains by both BMW and Mercedes last month indicate
that the battle to be the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S.
will continue through 2012 as inventories and new products
arrive in dealerships. BMW took the top spot last year with a
lead of just 2,715 units over its German rival.  “We’re going to be neck-in-neck,”  Steve Cannon , chief
executive officer of Mercedes’s U.S. operations, said yesterday
in an interview.  U.S. sales of the BMW brand rose to 23,940 last month while
Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz increased 7.7
percent to 23,134, according to statements yesterday by the
companies.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Lexus brand fell 2.6 percent to
20,140.  After three months, Munich-based BMW retook the sales lead
over Mercedes, which had held a 770 unit advantage after
February. BMW sales rose 17 percent to 61,549 in the first
quarter. During the same period, Mercedes deliveries advanced 15
percent to 61,513 while  Lexus  increased 3.7 percent to 49,096.  BMW became the top-selling U.S. luxury auto brand last year
after Lexus had held the spot for the previous 11 years.  The results exclude Daimler’s Sprinter vans and Smart cars
and BMW’s Mini brand, which aren’t  luxury vehicles .  Mercedes will beat its 2007 results of 253,000 sales, the
best year on record in the U.S., Cannon said. Mercedes sold
245,192 vehicles last year in the country.  BMW Growth  While BMW hasn’t given a growth target for 2012, Ludwig Willisch, head of BMW’s U.S. operations, said in February that
he expects sales to increase more than 10 percent and for the
new 3 Series to help keep BMW No. 1 in the U.S.  “The year is still young and BMW alone will introduce in
2012 more new and refreshed models in the U.S. than it ever has
before in any one year making us strongly optimistic about the
months ahead,” Willisch said yesterday in a statement.  BMW, which began selling a redesigned version of the 3
Series in February, saw sales of the sedan rise 16 percent in
March, the company said in a statement.  Mercedes sales have been helped by a new M-Class SUV and
updated C-Class sedan and new coupe version. Deliveries of the
M-Class rose 46 percent last month and the C-Class, while down
in March, increased 19 percent in the quarter, the automaker
said in a statement.  C-Class Overhaul  “We’re putting up essentially a redesigned C-Class against
the brand new 3 Series,” Mercedes’s Cannon said. “It’s new
product against new product.”  Mercedes has better inventory levels than BMW, which just
released its new model, he said.  “We’ll enjoy that advantage for as long as it lasts -- it
won’t last very long because they’re going to get more units out
there in inventory but for the moment we’re very optimistic,”
Cannon said.  Mercedes plans to bring an updated version of the GLK SUV
to showrooms later this year.  The two companies’ gains in the first quarter, which
typically are the worst for luxury sales, suggest the rest of
the year will be strong, said  Jesse Toprak , an industry analyst
with TrueCar.com, a website that tracks auto sales.  “You’re going to see them outpace industry growth for the
rest of the year nearly every month,” he said.  Audi Sales  BMW and Mercedes aren’t just competing for the luxury
market in the U.S. They’re wrestling for global supremacy as
well. Daimler has fallen to third behind  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi
globally.  U.S. deliveries of  Audi , the premium brand of Wolfsburg,
Germany-based VW, rose 18 percent to 11,585 vehicles last month
in the U.S., the company said in a statement. First quarter
sales advanced 16 percent to 29,470.  Audi finished last year in sixth place behind Cadillac and
Acura, which sold 34,828 and 5,738 more vehicles respectively
than the German brand.  Cadillac’s lead over Audi narrowed to 1,496 units last
quarter as the U.S. brand has suffered from increased
competition by the German monikers and from an aging lineup that
will be updated later this year with the newt XTS and ATS
sedans.  Cadillac sales fell 13 percent to 10,537 last month,
finishing the quarter down 24 percent to 30,966.  “The competition is being very aggressive,” Kurt McNeil,
GM’s Cadillac vice president of sales, said yesterday in a
conference call. “It’s not for the faint of heart.”  Acura, Porsche  Cadillac’s lead over Acura narrowed as well, to 161 more
deliveries in the first quarter.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , based in  Tokyo , said in a statement that
sales for its Acura brand fell 11 percent to 11,166 last month
and finished the first quarter down 1.8 percent to 30,805.  Porsche AG (PAH3) , the Stuttgart-based automaker, sold 2,460
vehicles in the U.S., a 4.9 percent decrease, the company said
in a statement.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s Infiniti sold 10,185 vehicles, a 9.8
percent decline from a year earlier, the Yokohama, Japan-based
company, said in a statement.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 8,803 Lincolns in March, a 3.6 percent
gain from a year earlier, according to a statement from the
Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker.  Land Rover deliveries rose 22 percent to 4,199, while
Jaguar sales were up 51 percent to 1,321, the brands, owned by
Mumbai-based  Tata Motors Ltd (TTMT) , said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
