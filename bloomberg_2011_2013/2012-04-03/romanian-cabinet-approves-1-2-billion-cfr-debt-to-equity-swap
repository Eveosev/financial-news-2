Romania ’s government approved a
debt-to-equity swap for state-owned railway company CFR SA to
meet pledges to the  International Monetary Fund  and the European
Union.  The Bucharest-based Cabinet  wants to convert a 4 billion-
lei ($1.2 billion) debt into CFR shares and boost the company’s
capital, said government spokesman Dan Suciu in a phone
interview today. CFR accumulated the debt from unpaid bills and
penalties, Suciu said.  The Balkan nation, which secured a 5 billion-euro ($6.7
billion) precautionary loan from the IMF and the EU, is seeking
to lower its  budget deficit  to 1.9 percent of gross domestic
product this year from 4.35 percent last year and cut the costs
of running state-owned companies.  The government pledged to the lenders to sell a majority
stake in CFR’s unprofitable freight unit, CFR Marfa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
