The number of  oil tankers  hauling
Middle East crude to  Asia  has risen to the highest level since
December on increased Chinese demand for cargoes, according to
 Wells Fargo Securities LLC .  Chinese demand for crude spurred an increase in the
capacity of crude tankers sailing to Asia, rising 500,000
barrels daily last week, climbing to 13.2 million barrels a day,
the highest since December, Wells Fargo said in an e-mailed note
today.  So-called spot, or single-journey,  rates  for very large
crude carriers hauling 2 million barrels of Middle East crude
along the benchmark route to Asia have jumped 78 percent to
$41,093 a day in the past five days, according to the London-
based  Baltic Exchange . Forward freight agreements used to bet
on, or hedge, future shipping costs on this route may fall to
$21,000 a day during the second quarter, Wells Fargo said.  “We continue to expect the tanker market to retrench, with
rates spending significant portions of the second quarter, third
quarter closer to break-even levels,” Wells Fargo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
