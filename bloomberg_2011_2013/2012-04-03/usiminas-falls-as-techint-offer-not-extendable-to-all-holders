Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA , the second-largest Brazilian steelmaker, fell the most in
four months after the securities regulator ruled Techint Group
isn’t obligated to offer to buy out minority shareholders.  Voting shares  of Usiminas retreated 6.8 percent to 18.74
reais at the close of trading in  Sao Paulo . The benchmark
Bovespa index dropped 1.4 percent.  Techint Group’s purchase of 27.7 percent of the voting
capital in the Brazilian company at the end of last year for 20
reais a share doesn’t constitute a change in control so the
offer doesn’t need to be made to minority shareholders, the
regulator said yesterday. Under Brazilian rules, minority
holders of voting shares would receive an offer of at least 80
percent of the price paid to controlling shareholders if a
company is acquired.  “These shares went up this year, gaining more than the
Bovespa, in part because of the expectations there could be a
decision in favor of the minority holders,”  Pedro Galdi , an
analyst at SLW Corretora in Sao Paulo, said by phone. “We don’t
see room for an additional rise.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
