PT Borneo Lumbung Energi & Metal (BORN) ’s
$1 billion loan has attracted a $200 million commitment from
 First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB) , a person familiar with the matter said.  First Gulf Bank joins as a bookrunner with a so-called take
and hold commitment, the person said, asking not to be
identified because the details are private. The take and hold is
the amount of a loan that banks intend to retain on their
balance sheet rather than selling to other banks in general
syndication.  Ken Allan, Borneo Lumbung’s marketing director, didn’t
immediately return a message left for him by phone or an e-mail
seeking comment on the financing. Two messages left with the
office of Mustaza Bin Kassim, First Gulf Bank’s Singapore chief
executive officer, weren’t immediately returned.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , which fully funded the $1 billion
loan in January, is arranging the syndication, the person said.
The London-based lender began approaching banks to join the
facility in November, a person familiar with the matter said at
the time. In an unrelated deal, First Gulf Bank said in a March
25 statement it’s lending $350 million to PT Asmin Koalindo
Tuhup, a unit of Borneo Lumbung, for working capital.  Borneo Lumbung, a Jakarta-based maker of coking coal, said
in January that it had bought a 23.8 percent stake in coal
producer Bumi Plc from PT Bakrie & Brothers for $1 billion cash.
