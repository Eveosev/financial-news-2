Accel Partners , the venture firm
that backed  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and  Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , is investing $14
million in Israeli social gaming developer Dragonplay, adding to
its investments in the fast-growing industry.  Tel Aviv-based Dragonplay will use the investment to expand
an existing portfolio of games on Facebook and for mobile
devices based on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android software, the companies
said in a statement. The company will also launch on new
platforms including Apple Inc.’s iOS operating system.  Accel, based in Palo Alto, California, has also backed
gaming companies including Rovio Entertainment Oy, the publisher
of ‘Angry Birds’ games.  Social gaming companies including Zynga Inc., the largest
maker of games for Facebook, are expanding into new business
areas as the penetration of mobile devices rises. Zynga, based
in  San Francisco , is targeting so-called social gambling for
growth, founder Mark Pincus said in February. Dragonplay’s
titles include “Live Holdem Poker Pro” and “Live Blackjack.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
