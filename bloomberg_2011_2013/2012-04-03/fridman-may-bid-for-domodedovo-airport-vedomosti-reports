Russian billionaire  Mikhail
Fridman ’s  Alfa Group  asked state-run development bank VEB, which
is overseen by Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin , for financing as
it seeks to acquire Moscow’s Domodedovo Airport.  Alfa’s A1 investment arm applied to VEB for a loan to buy
Domodedovo, Eastern Europe’s biggest airport, Andrey Kocherov,
an A1 spokesman, said by phone, declining to elaborate.
Ekaterina Grishkovets, a VEB spokeswoman, declined to comment.  VEB may provide A1 about $2 billion of the $3 billion
needed for the purchase,  Vedomosti  said, citing an unidentified
person with knowledge of the negotiations. A1 is also talking
with VEB about a joint acquisition, the newspaper said.  Businessman Ziyavudin Magomedov’s Summa Group, which plans
to borrow from state-run lender OAO Sberbank, is also willing to
buy the airport for $3 billion, according to Vedomosti. Summa
declined to comment when called by Bloomberg.  Goldman Sachs is advising Domodedovo’s owners on the sale,
the newspaper said. Domodedovo Chairman Dmitry Kamenshchik, who
was identified as the full beneficiary of Domodedovo Ltd. last
year, has since declined to comment on the airport’s ownership.  To contact the reporter on this story:
