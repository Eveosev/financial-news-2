Belgium ’s sugar-beet crop was about
80 percent planted as of yesterday as dry conditions benefited
field work, the Royal Belgian Institute for Beet Improvement, or
KBIVB, reported.  Farmers had planted about 50,195 hectares (124,032 acres)
of beets on April 2, more than double the 22,910 hectares sown a
week earlier, the institute said in a  report  on its website
today.  The crop was 50 percent sown on March 28, one day behind
last year’s planting pace and compared with a 20-year average of
April 11, KBIVB wrote. Farmers are expected to plant 62,570
hectares with beets, down from 64,404 hectares in 2011,
according to the report.  “Due to an early sowing date, high levels of beet yields
can again be considered, as was the case in 2011, provided that
weather conditions are favorable for beet development,” the
institute wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
