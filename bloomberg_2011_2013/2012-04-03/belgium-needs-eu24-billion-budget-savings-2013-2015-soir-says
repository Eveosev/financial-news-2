Belgium will need to find 24 billion
euros ($32 billion) in budget savings between 2013 and 2015 if
it is to meet its deficit-reduction targets,  Le Soir  reported,
citing a report by an expert committee advising the government.  The committee, which will report the figures to the
government in Brussels today, will call for 5 billion euros of
savings in 2013, 8 billion euros in 2014 and 11 billion euros in
2015, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
