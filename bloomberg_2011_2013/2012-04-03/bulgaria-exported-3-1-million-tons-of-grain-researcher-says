Bulgaria exported 3.1 million metric
tons of grain in the marketing year from July 1 through
February, agricultural researcher UkrAgroConsult said, without
providing a year-ago comparison.  Exports included 1.87 million tons of wheat and 3,240 tons
of barley, the Kiev-based researcher said in an e-mail
yesterday. Corn exports were 898,000 tons from Sept. 1 through
February, and another 202,000 tons of corn will be exported
through Aug. 31, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
