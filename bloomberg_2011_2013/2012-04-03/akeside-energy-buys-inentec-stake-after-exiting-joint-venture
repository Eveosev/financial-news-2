Lakeside Energy LLC, an energy
investor backed by private-equity firm American Securities LLC,
acquired a stake in closely held InEnTec Inc. after exchanging
its holding in a joint venture with the company.  Lakeside, based in  Chicago , acquired the stake through an
“equity for equity exchange” of its ownership in joint venture
InEnTec Chemical LLC, InEnTec said in an e-mailed statement.
Terms weren’t disclosed. The venture develops systems at
chemical manufacturing sites that process waste into reusable
chemicals or gases used as fuel for steam generation.  The deal follows a similar one executed with  Waste
Management Inc. (WM)  in October, in which the company bought a stake
in InEnTec after exchanging its holding in joint venture S4
Energy Solutions LLC. The transactions make InEnTec, based in
Bend,  Oregon , sole owner of both joint ventures and their
operating projects, according to the statement.  InEnTec Chemical since 2009 has operated a facility at Dow
Corning Corp.’s silicon materials plant in Midland,  Michigan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
