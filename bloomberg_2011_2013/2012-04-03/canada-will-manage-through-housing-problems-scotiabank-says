Canada  will withstand concerns about
the housing market because of its relatively strong global
position,  Bank of Nova Scotia  Chief Executive Officer  Richard Waugh  said.  “The current concerns about Canada’s housing market are
reason for caution but not pessimism,” said Waugh, according to
the text of his speech at the bank’s 180th annual meeting today
in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. “We can and will manage through any
potential problems.”  Waugh, 64, said Canadian household balance sheets “remain
solid, and our housing market is supported by strong
fundamentals.” He said it’s up to Canadian banks, and not
government or regulators, to manage risks and advise clients
appropriately.  Scotiabank had record annual profit last year of C$5.27
billion ($5.32 billion), driven by increases in domestic and
international consumer banking. Last month, the lender said net
income in the fiscal first quarter rose 15 percent to C$1.44
billion.  Waugh, a vice chairman of the  Institute of International
Finance , expects the global economy to have “prolonged period
of slower economic growth, higher market volatility and
continued uncertainty.”  “It’s important to note that Canada remains in a stronger
position than most others,” Waugh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
