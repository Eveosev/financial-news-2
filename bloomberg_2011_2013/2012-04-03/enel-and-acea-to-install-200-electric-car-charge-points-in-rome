The city of Rome, the local power
company  Acea SpA (ACE)  and Italy’s biggest utility  Enel SpA (ENEL)  are
seeking to add 200 electric-vehicle charging points in the
Italian capital.  Roma Capitale, the city’s municipal authority, signed a
memorandum of understanding with Acea and Enel, which will each
install 100 charging points in the city, according to an e-
mailed statement today. The network of charge points will be the
largest in Italy on public property.  Drivers will use a single card to use any of the points,
with the charges appearing on their monthly electricity bills.  Enel also operates the  E-Mobility Italy  charging network
throughout the country, a joint venture it formed with Daimler
AG in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
