Empresa Agroindustrial Pomalca SA (POMALCC1) ,
Peru’s second-largest sugar producer, rose the most in two
months as investors bet that the government will accelerate
plans to transfer its remaining shares in the company.  Pomalca jumped 5.4 percent to 59 centimos at 1:17 p.m. in
 Lima  trading, the steepest intraday advance since Feb. 3. The
stock has gained 23 percent this year.  The government plans to transfer its 33 percent stake in
Pomalca, as well as shares in two other sugar mills, to workers
by the end of June in exchange for back pay and other
compensation owned to them, Jose Leon, president of the
congressional agricultural committee, said in a March 6
interview. The companies will then owe the state.  “Investors are counting on the state offloading its shares
soon,” said Leoncio Altamirano, a trader at Lima-based Juan
Magot y Asociados SAB. “This will help the sugar industry to
reorganize their finances.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
