Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM)  fell the
most in more than three months as investors speculated that the
BlackBerry maker’s possible acquirers are dropping off.  RIM declined 9.5 percent, more than erasing gains made late
last week when the company said it wouldn’t rule out a sale of
the company as part of its strategic overhaul.  “There are not that many buyers left” that could
potentially bid for RIM, said  Roger Entner , an analyst at Recon
Analytics LLC in Dedham,  Massachusetts . “BlackBerry is running
out of sugar daddies.”  Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins said last week RIM
is exploring the possibility of licensing its new operating
system and partnerships after reporting sales that missed
analysts’ estimates for a fifth consecutive quarter. He said he
would consider a sale while stressing that is not the “main
direction” for the Waterloo, Ontario-based company.  RIM  slid  to $13.01 at the close in  New York , its biggest
drop since Dec. 16. The stock gained 7.1 percent on March 30,
the day after Heins laid out the company’s strategic options.
Today’s decline leaves the stock 77 percent lower than where it
was 12 months ago.  “My gnome is hearing that all bidders have walked from
RIM,”  Douglas Kass , founder of hedge fund Seabreeze Partners
Management, said in a Twitter post today. In a phone interview,
he confirmed the post was his.  To contact the reporter on this story:
