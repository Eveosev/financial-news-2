The Minerva Project, calling itself
the first elite American University created in a century, raised
$25 million and said former U.S. Treasury Secretary  Larry Summers  is joining as chairman of the advisory board.  Minerva is providing undergraduate education and will help
students through their careers, the San Francisco-based company
said today in a statement. The funding is coming from  Benchmark
Capital , which said it’s the largest seed financing in the
firm’s history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
