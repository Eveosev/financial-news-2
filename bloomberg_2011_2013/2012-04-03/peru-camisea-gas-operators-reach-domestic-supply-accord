Peru’s government reached an accord
with the operators of its largest natural-gas fields that
ensures domestic supplies and shouldn’t endanger future
investment, company and government officials said.  The seven-company  Camisea Group  will seek reserves in
neighboring fields to complement Block 88, which will be devoted
exclusively to domestic supplies, operator Pluspetrol SA’s
country manager German Jimenez said today at a televised
ceremony at the gas fields after signing an agreement that ended
eight months of negotiations.  President  Ollanta Humala  was elected last year on pledges
to give priority to local power plants and petrochemical
projects before exports to Mexico. Lack of gas supply is
delaying $16 billion in investment projects by companies such as
 Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) ,  CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF)  and  Orica Ltd. (ORI) ,
according to the National Society of Mining, Petroleum & Energy.  “We agreed on our future interests through dialogue,
without any need for drastic measures,”Humala said at the same
ceremony. “The construction of the  gas pipeline  and the
petrochemical cluster are on track thanks to the fact we now
have Block 88.”  Peru’s oil and gas exports jumped by 50 percent to $5
billion last year after a separate group including Hunt,  Repsol
YPF SA (REP)  and  SK Group  of South Korea started a $4 billion
liquefied natural-gas export plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
