Ukraine’s soybeans exports advanced
12 percent in six months from September 1 through February to
691,000 metric tons, according to UkrAgroConsult.  This compares with 617,000 tons exported in the same period
a year earlier, the Kiev-based agricultural researcher said in
an e-mailed statement yesterday. The soybeans went to the
European Union,  Egypt ,  Turkey  and  Syria , according to the
statement.  Another 350,000 tons to 400,000 tons of soybeans will be
exported from Ukraine from March through May and will be
followed by a seasonal slowdown in June to August, the
researcher said. Soybean exports for the year to Aug. 31 will be
up 31 percent, at 990,000 tons, it said.  The country’s soybean harvest was 2.28 million tons last
year, or 36 percent more than a year earlier, according to
UkrAgroConsult.  To contact the reporter on this story:
