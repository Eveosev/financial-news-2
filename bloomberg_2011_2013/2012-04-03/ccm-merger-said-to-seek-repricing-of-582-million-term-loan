CCM Merger Inc., the owner and
operator of MotorCity Casino Hotel in downtown  Detroit , is
seeking to reprice its $582 million  term loan , according to a
person with knowledge of the transaction.  The debt due in March 2017 will pay 4.75 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the terms are private.
Libor, a rate banks say they can borrow in dollars from each
other, will have a 1.25 percent floor.  Lenders on the repricing will be offered one-year soft-call
protection of 101 cents, the person said, meaning the company
would have to pay 1 cent more than face value to refinance the
debt during the first year.  The loan was originally priced in March 2011 at 5
percentage points more than Libor, with a 2 percent floor,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company’s $20 million revolving line of credit due
March 2016 will continue to pay 5 percentage points more than
Libor and will no longer have a minimum on the benchmark, the
person said. The revolver previously had a 2 percent Libor
floor, the data show. There will be a 50 basis-point fee on the
unused portion of the revolver, the person said.  Bank of America Corp. is arranging the financing and will
host a lender call tomorrow at 2 p.m. in  New York , according to
the person. Investors will have until April 13 to submit
commitments and the amendment is expected to be effective on
April 17.  Jacci Woods, a spokeswoman for MotorCity Casino, declined
comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
