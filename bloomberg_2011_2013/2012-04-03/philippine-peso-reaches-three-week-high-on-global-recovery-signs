The Philippine peso touched a three-
week high as signs of improvement in the global economy
brightened the outlook for exports and spurred demand for
higher-yielding assets.  The currency closed little changed after reports showed U.S.
manufacturing picked up in March and China’s services sector
expanded at the fastest pace in six months. Philippine 10-year
bonds  yield  355 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Higher-yielding currencies are performing well in a risk-
on environment,” said Andy Ji, a Singapore-based foreign-
exchange strategist at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia .  The peso closed at 42.692 per dollar in  Manila , compared
with 42.690 yesterday, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The
currency reached 42.550 today, the highest level since March 13.
The peso’s one-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at
5.90 percent.  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
climbed to 53.4 last month from 52.4 in February, a report from
the Tempe, Arizona-based group showed yesterday. Readings
greater than 50 signal growth.  China ’s non-manufacturing
purchasing managers’ index rose to 58 in March from 48.4 in
February, official data showed today.  The yield on the Philippines’ 7.375 percent bonds due March
2021 was steady at 5.35 percent, according to prices from
Tradition Financial Services.  Inflation probably quickened to 2.8 percent in March from
2.7 percent the previous month, based on the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey before a government report
tomorrow. February’s rate was the lowest since September 2009.  The government reported today its first  budget surplus  in
six months in February. The surplus was 10.66 billion pesos
($250 million) compared with a previously reported 15.9 billion-
peso deficit for January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
