Japan ’s nuclear watchdog ordered
Chubu Electric Power Co. to assess the impact of a tsunami as
high as 21 meters (69 feet) on its Hamaoka plant after a
government panel said quakes could trigger such sea waves.  Chubu Electric is constructing additional defenses to
protect the plant from a 15-meter-high tsunami, similar to the
one that hit Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi
station, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said in a
 statement  yesterday. The company, based in Aichi, western Japan,
should take steps based on its assessment and report to NISA by
April 16, the agency said.  The Hamaoka plant in Shizuoka prefecture southwest of Tokyo
was shut in May at the request of then Prime Minister  Naoto Kan 
after the Fukushima disaster raised concerns that Japan’s
nuclear plants may not be adequately protected from natural
disasters. The company said it plans to spend 140 billion yen
($1.7 billion) to construct additional tsunami defenses.  Chubu Electric is building an 18-meter-high seawall and
will examine whether it needs to revise its tsunami defense
measures, originally scheduled to be completed by December, Akio Miyazaki, a spokesman, said by phone.  Sea waves higher than 20 meters could hit six prefectures,
including Shizuoka, if a magnitude-9.1 quake occurs in the
Nankai Trough, located south of Japan’s Honshu island, a panel
under the Cabinet Office said in a preliminary  report  March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
