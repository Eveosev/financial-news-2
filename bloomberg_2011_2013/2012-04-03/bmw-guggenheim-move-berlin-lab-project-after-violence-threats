New York ’s Solomon R. Guggenheim
Foundation said it has found an alternative venue in Berlin for
its mobile laboratory, the  BMW Guggenheim Lab , after left-wing
activists threatened violence against its original plan to set
up in the district of Kreuzberg.  The project, sponsored by  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , is
scheduled to travel to nine cities worldwide over six years to
encourage debate and proposals for the future of urban life.
Instead of opening in Kreuzberg in May, it will now open in
Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg district from June 15 to July 29,
according to an e-mailed statement sent today by the foundation.  “The decision to relocate the lab was not an easy one, but
we are very pleased to have so quickly confirmed such a suitable
alternative,”  Richard Armstrong , director of the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum and Foundation said in the statement. “The
lab can only flourish through input and participation from
people of all viewpoints, so in that sense the Berlin Lab has
already begun.”  Left-wing activists used the Internet to urge protesters to
disrupt the project, according to the daily Tagesspiegel
newspaper. Their protest was that the project would accelerate
the gentrification of Kreuzberg, leading to higher rents and new
luxury residential developments, the newspaper said.  The new location is the  Pfefferberg  on Schoenhauser Allee,
a former industrial complex that now houses artists’ studios,
galleries and restaurants.  To contact the reporter on the story:
