South African vehicle sales
increased at the slowest pace in more than two years in March as
companies cut back on purchases, an industry group said.  Sales (NAAMTSYY)  rose 4.8 percent in March from a year earlier to
56,110, the Pretoria-based National Association of Automobile
Manufacturers of  South Africa  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Growth in sales eased from 6.4 percent in February.  Companies have pared back spending as the debt crisis in
 Europe  curbed demand in a region that buys about a third of
South African manufactured exports. Growth in  Africa ’s largest
economy is set to slow to 2.7 percent this year from 3.1 percent
in 2011, according to the government.  Passenger-car sales increased 11 percent in March from a
year earlier to 38,970, while purchases of light commercial
vehicles, such as pick-up trucks and minivans, fell 7.5 percent
to 14,556, Naamsa said. Sales of heavy trucks and buses declined
2.7 percent to 1,650 units.  “Sharp increases in energy and transport costs would
impact negatively on consumer disposable income in the months
ahead,” the association said. Domestic sales are “expected to
continue to reflect growth but at relatively subdued rates.”  Brent crude oil has surged 11 percent in  London  this year,
prompting the government to boost the price of gasoline by 6.3
percent in April in Gauteng province, the country’s commercial
hub.  Vehicle exports slumped 20 percent to 23,956 last month
because of lower demand from Europe, the association said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
