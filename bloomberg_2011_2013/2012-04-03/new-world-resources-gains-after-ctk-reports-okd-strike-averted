New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech coking-coal producer, rose after its OKD AS unit called
off a strike warning following an agreement on wages, according
to the CTK public newswire.  The stock increased 2 percent to 133.8 koruna as of 10:56
a.m. in Prague, making it the third-best performer in the  PX (PX) 
index of 14 equities, which added 0.6 percent. A close at that
level would be the biggest jump for NWR since March 26.  OKD’s trade union revoked a strike warning declared on Feb.
28 after management proposed to increase wages by 3 percent
starting this month, CTK reported late yesterday, citing OKD
union leader Jaromir Pytlik.  “The 2012 wage agreement is a successful outcome for the
company,” Bram Buring, an analyst at Wood & Co. in  Prague ,
wrote in a report to clients today. The deal is “positive” for
NWR shares after the unions originally demanded a 7 percent
increase and Wood & Co. expected a 4 percent rise, Buring said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
