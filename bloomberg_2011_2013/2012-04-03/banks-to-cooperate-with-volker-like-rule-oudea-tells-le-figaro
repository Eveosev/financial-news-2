French banks are ready to cooperate
with European guidelines “inspired by” the Volcker rule,
Societe Generale SA’s Chief Executive Officer  Frederic Oudea 
said in an interview in  Le Figaro  online.  “What’s at stake is to continue to have a solid retail
bank, but also investment bank activities that perform well
because the new Basel capital requirements are going to impose
the development of the financing of European economies through
the market,” Oudea told the publication.  He added that no one expects a complete separation of
banks’ activities on an international level, Figaro reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
