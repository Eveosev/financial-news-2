Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  added 0.5 percent to 63,284.54 at 5:30 p.m. in Istanbul,
the highest level since July 2011.  The following stocks are active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  AFM Uluslararasi Film Produksiyon & San AS (AFMAS)  , a
chain of cinemas, dropped 1.8 percent to 13.50 liras, declining
for the first day in three, after it said a ruling by the
competition regulator would lead it to sell six of its cinemas,
including four in Istanbul.  Aksa Enerji Uretim AS (AKSEN)  , a utility, fell 3.8
percent to 3.77 liras, dropping for a second day. Turkey may
raise natural gas prices by another 15 percent, following an
18.7 percent increase on April 1, to stem losses at the state-
run provider Botas, Haberturk newspaper reported, citing
unidentified Energy Ministry officials.  Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL)  , Turkey’s
largest mobile phone carrier, fell for a fifth day, losing 0.7
percent to 8.98 liras after saying a majority-owned unit failed
to pay a $150 million loan, leaving Turkcell liable as the sole
guarantor for payment by April 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
