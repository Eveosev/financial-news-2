Iran has captured 13 pirates after a
clash in the  Indian Ocean , according to Iranian Navy Commander
Habibollah Sayari, the state-run  Fars  news agency reported.  The confrontation between an Iranian military vessel and
the pirates took place 3,000 kilometers (1,860 miles) off Iran’s
coast, Sayari said in Tehran today.  The 13 held individuals are being transferred to Iranian
soil, he added without giving further details.  There are about 3,500 Somali pirates attacking vessels off
Africa’s eastern coast in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean, the
 United Nations  said in February. Somali pirate attacks rose to a
record 237 in 2011.  In January, the U.S. Navy rescued 13 Iranian fishermen held
hostage by pirates in the Northern Arabian Sea days, an
operation welcomed by  Iran ’s Foreign Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
