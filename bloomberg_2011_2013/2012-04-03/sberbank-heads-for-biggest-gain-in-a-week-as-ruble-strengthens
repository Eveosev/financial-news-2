OAO Sberbank (SBER03) ,  Russia ’s largest bank,
climbed for a third day as the ruble rose against the U.S.
currency.  The stock advanced 2.9 percent to 97.92 rubles by the close
in Moscow, the biggest one-day gain since Feb. 24.  The ruble strengthened for a third day, appreciating 0.7
percent to 29.1550 per dollar. A stronger ruble discourages
Russians from withdrawing and converting ruble deposits,
Sberbank’s main source of funding.  VTB Group, Russia’s second-largest bank, also increased a
third day, adding 2 percent to 6.969 kopeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
