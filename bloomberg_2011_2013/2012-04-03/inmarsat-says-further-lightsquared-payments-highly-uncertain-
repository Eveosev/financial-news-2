Inmarsat Plc (ISAT) , the biggest provider
of satellite services to the maritime industry, said payments
from  LightSquared Inc. (SKYT)  related to a spectrum-cooperation accord
remain “highly uncertain.”  LightSquared failed to pay Inmarsat $29.6 million due March
31, triggering a notice of default under the terms of their
cooperation accord, the London-based company said in a statement
today. LightSquared had already missed a payment of $56.3
million in February.  “Further payments under the cooperation agreement remain
highly uncertain,” Inmarsat said in the statement, adding that
a “material” one is due tomorrow.  The U.K. company said last month it couldn’t predict
whether it will receive outstanding payments from Philip Falcone’s LightSquared, the U.S. company struggling to gain
approval for a wireless service.  Under the companies’ agreement, Inmarsat is giving
LightSquared access to part of its spectrum. LightSquared,
backed by Falcone’s Harbinger Capital Partners hedge fund, said
March 30 that regulators should help find a resolution to
interference concerns rather than block the proposed wireless
service. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said in
February that it would block LightSquared after the Obama
administration found the service would disrupt navigation gear.  Inmarsat said today it doesn’t plan to make any more public
statements related to non-payment events under the cooperation
accord. Inmarsat said it remains in discussions regarding the
future of the accord.  To contact the reporter on this story:
