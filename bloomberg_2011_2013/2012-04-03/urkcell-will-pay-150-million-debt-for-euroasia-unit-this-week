Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL) ,
Turkeyâ€™s biggest mobile phone company, said it will pay off a
$150 million debt for its Euroasia Telecommunications unit this
week.  Turkcell owns 55 percent of Euroasia and was sole guarantor
for a 2005 bank loan to the company to fund Astelit LLC, a
wholly owned Euroasia subsidiary operating in Ukraine, Turkcell
said in a statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  after the
market close yesterday.  Euroasia was unable to repay the loan when it came due on
March 30 and, according to the credit guarantee, Turkcell must
do so on or before April 6, Turkcell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
