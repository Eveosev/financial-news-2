Posco (005490) , the world’s third-largest
steelmaker by output, plans to raise about $535 million selling
stakes in three South Korean companies to improve its finances.  Posco will sell about 2.2 million shares in Seoul-based
 Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790)  for 44,050 won to 44,900 won ($40)
each, according to terms of the sales obtained by Bloomberg
News. It’s also offering about 2.3 million shares in  SK Telecom
Co. (017670)  for 135,400 won to 139,700 won apiece and 3.9 million shares
in KB Financial Group Inc. at 41,500 won to 42,300 won each, the
terms show.  Posco is seeking to sell some of its holdings in the three
companies to bolster its books through the sale of non-steel
assets, spokesman Chung Jae Woong said today by telephone,
responding to a Bloomberg query about an earlier report by
Edaily on the stake sale. He didn’t elaborate.  Irene Kim, a Seoul-based spokeswoman at SK Telecom,
confirmed the sale, without giving details.  Shares of Posco fell 0.5 percent to close at 380,500 won in
Seoul trading. The Edaily report was published after the stock
market closed. SK Telecom ended up 1.4 percent at 142,500 won,
while KB dropped 0.5 percent to 42,300 won and Hana was
unchanged at 44,900 won.  To contact the reporters on this story:
