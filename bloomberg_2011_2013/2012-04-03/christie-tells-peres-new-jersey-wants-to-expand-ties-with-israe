New Jersey (STONJ1)  Governor Chris Christie
met with Israeli President  Shimon Peres  and said he hopes to
expand commercial ties with the Jewish state.  Christie visited Peres today before laying a wreath at the
Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and embarking on a tour of Israeli
companies with links to his state.  “New Jersey stands with Israel in all its endeavors,”
Christie said in an audio recording from the welcoming ceremony
at Peres’ residence in Jerusalem that was e-mailed by the
president’s office. Peres called Christie an “outstanding
friend of Israel.”  Christie, who is traveling with his family and a delegation
of business executives, met yesterday with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu. More than 700  New Jersey  companies do
business with Israel and 65 Israeli firms maintain operations in
the U.S. state, according to the  website  of the New Jersey-
Israel Commission.  After Yad Vashem, Christie was scheduled to visit Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the world’s biggest maker of
generic drugs, in the Tel Aviv suburb of Petach Tikvah,
according to his schedule. He also planned to tour Better Place
Inc., which developed a battery-charging system for electric
cars.  New Jersey has the second-highest Jewish population by
percentage after New York, according to Census  data . Jews made
up 5.8 percent of New Jersey’s 2009 population, trailing New
York’s 8.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
