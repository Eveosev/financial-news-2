South African white-corn futures rose
to the highest level in three weeks a day after the country
lowered the forecast for production of the grain this season.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
gained less than 0.1 percent to 2,198.80 rand ($230) a metric
ton by the midday close in Johannesburg today, the highest since
May 3 and extended the weekly advance to 1 percent. The yellow
variety for delivery in the same month rose 0.3 percent to
2,176.40 rand a ton.  The country may reap 11.4 million metric tons of corn this
season, the committee said yesterday. That is the same as the
median estimate by six analysts in a Bloomberg survey and down
from last month’s forecast of 11.6 million tons.  “It has much to do with the rand and the fact that the
Crop Estimates Committee lowered their estimate yesterday by
over a percent,” Benjamin Swanepoel, a trader for Trademar
futures (Pty) Ltd., said by phone in Johannesburg.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal from the white variety is a staple food while yellow is
mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in July rose 0.3 percent to 3,567 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
