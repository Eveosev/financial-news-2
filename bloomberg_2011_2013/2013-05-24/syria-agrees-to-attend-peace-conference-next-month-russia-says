Bashar al-Assad’s government has
agreed to attend an international conference next month aimed at
ending 26 months of conflict in  Syria , Russia said.  The main Syrian opposition groups, however, are trying to
sabotage U.S.-Russian efforts to broker a peace deal, Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said today in
Moscow. “They are doing everything to quash the idea of this
conference,” he said in televised comments.  While President Assad has shown “a constructive attitude”
and some of his domestic opponents have also agreed to attend,
the key opposition movements continue to insist that the Syrian
leader step down, said Lukashevich. “This isn’t very
encouraging but nevertheless in Moscow we haven’t lost hope of
realizing this U.S.-Russian initiative.”  U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  and his Russian
counterpart  Sergei Lavrov  will meet in Paris on Monday to plan
for the Syria conference, the State Department said today.  The U.S. and Russia are seeking to persuade Syria’s
government and rebels to come together for negotiations in
Geneva next month aimed at a cease-fire and establishing a
transitional government. The fighting between forces loyal to
Assad and Syrian rebels has taken at least 80,000 lives and
created more than 1.5 million refugees, according to United
Nations estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
