Japanese  stocks  swung wildly before
closing less than 1 percent higher, the day after the biggest
rout since the March 2011 disaster erased $314 billion.  The  Topix Index (TPX)  added 0.5 percent to close at 1,194.08 in
Tokyo. The gauge earlier rose 3.3 percent and then fell by the
same amount as the yen strengthened after  Bank of Japan  Governor
Haruhiko Kuroda said enough stimulus had been announced. The
Topix slid 6.9 percent yesterday.  “The market is going up and down like a roller coaster,”
said Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo,
which oversees the equivalent of $147 billion. “The
fundamentals haven’t changed, but more and more investors are
trading on momentum. Things will probably calm down in a week.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average pared a decline of as much as
3.5 percent to close 0.9 percent higher at 14,612.45. The Nikkei
Volatility Index touched a two-year high, extending yesterday’s
58 percent jump, before retreating.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co. surged 9.9 percent, recouping some
of yesterday’s 13 percent loss, with utilities gaining the most
among the Topix’s 33 industry groups. Airlines added 3 percent.
Oil and coal producers slid 1.9 percent, while paper makers
dropped 1.6 percent.  Even after this week’s 4.7 percent slump, the Topix is
still up 39 percent for the year, making  Japan  the best-performing developed market. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has
advanced 16 percent since the end of December, while the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index added 9 percent.  Japan’s broadest equities gauge trades at about 1.3 times
book value, compared with about 2.4 for the S&P 500 and 1.7 for
the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
