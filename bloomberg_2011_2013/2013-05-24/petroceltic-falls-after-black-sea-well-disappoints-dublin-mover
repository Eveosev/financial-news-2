Petroceltic International Plc (PCI) , an oil
and gas company, fell the most in a week in Dublin trading after
saying it abandoned a well in the  Black Sea  off  Bulgaria  as it
doesn’t have commercial gas volumes.  Petroceltic dropped as much as 3.7 percent after saying it
is analysing the well data to determine whether to enter into
the final two year extension of the exploration licence later
this year. The Dublin-based company fell as much as 8.5 percent
in London trading before paring earlier losses.  “While we believe that the value implications are limited,
a positive outcome would have helped maintain the Bulgarian
production profile,” said Job Langbroek, an analyst with Davy
in Dublin, who has an outperform rating on the company. “The
result reminds us that exploration is an uncertain activity,
even in cases with a high expectation of success.”  Chief Executive Officer Brian O’Cathain said Petroceltic
was “disappointed with the outcome” of the Kamchia-1 well.
The drilling rig will now move to complete a development well on
the Kaliakra gas discovery, and then drill the company’s first
exploration wells offshore  Romania  later this year, Petroceltic
said.  Petroceltic traded down 3.7 percent to 7.8 cents as of
10:22 a.m., with 24,000 shares traded. That is the equivalent of
23 percent of the average daily trading over the past three
months. The stock fell 2.2 percent in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
