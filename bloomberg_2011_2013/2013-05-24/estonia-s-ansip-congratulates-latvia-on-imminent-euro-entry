Estonian Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip 
congratulated his Latvian counterpart, Valdis Dombrovskis, on
his country’s “imminent” adoption of the euro, a week and a
half before the European Commission weighs in on  Latvia ’s bid.  “Latvia’s finances and economy are in good shape, and I’m
very happy that the euro area will get another strong member,”
Ansip said in a meeting today with Dombrovskis in the Estonian
capital, Tallinn. His comments were distributed in an e-mailed
government statement.  The Brussels-based commission will issue its “convergence
report” on June 5, assessing whether Latvia fulfills the
criteria for adopting the euro. If the commission backs Latvia’s
bid, the formal decision would be made by European Union finance
ministers on July 9 after consultation with the European
Parliament and discussion by EU leaders.  “The procedure would be fully completed once the  Council
of Ministers , acting by unanimity of its euro area member states
and Latvia, has irrevocably fixed the exchange rate of the lats
to the euro,” the commission  said .  Latvia would be the currency bloc’s 18th member and the
fourth eastern European country to join. Estonia adopted the
euro in 2011 and neighboring  Lithuania  aims to join in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
