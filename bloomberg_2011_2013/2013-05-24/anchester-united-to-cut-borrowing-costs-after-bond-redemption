Manchester United , which won its 20th
English league title this season, may save about 10 million
pounds ($15 million) a year by repaying about $290 million of
bonds with a loan paying a lower  interest rate .  The company plans to redeem 177.8 million pounds of its
8.75 percent bonds and $22.1 million of its 8.375 percent notes,
according to a statement. Under the terms of the notes, the
pound securities can be bought back at a price of 108.75 percent
of face value and the dollar bonds are callable at 108.38,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank of America Corp. is providing a loan to fund the
redemption, the club said. Based on current levels, the
financing would pay interest of about 2.78 percent, saving about
10 million pounds a year, it said.  United raised $233 million last year in an U.S. initial
public offering with the proceeds used to repay debt. Its
borrowings totaled 368 million pounds at the end of March, a
fall of 13 percent compared to March 2012, it said earlier this
month. It repurchased about 63 million pounds of bonds during
the year, paying about 68 million pounds, it said at the time.  The football club earned 60.8 million pounds in broadcast
payments as it won this seasonâ€™s English championship, including
15 million pounds for topping the league.  To contact the reporter on this story:
