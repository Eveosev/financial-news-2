U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of  Florida 
may want to put a trip to  Iowa  on his calendar if he’s planning
to run for president in 2016. He’s already behind.  While primary-season voting is more than two years away,
pollsters are testing potential Republican and Democratic
candidates and Hillary Clinton has an early lead in Iowa, the
state that traditionally hosts the first nomination contests.  In head-to-head match-ups, the former first lady,
Democratic senator from New York and U.S. secretary of state has
a bigger lead over Rubio, 41, than she does over Republican
Senator  Rand Paul  of  Kentucky , who has said he may make a 2016
presidential bid. Paul, 50, appears to be a stronger Republican
candidate in Iowa now than Rubio, said Peter A. Brown, assistant
director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.  “Part of the reason may be the publicity from his recent
high-profile visit to the state, but more likely is that he
begins with a solid base of support -- the folks who voted for
his father in the 2008 and 2012 caucuses,” Brown said of Paul.  Clinton, 65, ran an unsuccessful presidential campaign in
2008 and has said she doesn’t plan a second bid. She also hasn’t
ruled it out.  She led Rubio 48 percent to 37 percent in a survey of Iowa
voters released today by Hamden, Connecticut-based Quinnipiac
University. She was ahead of Paul 46 percent to 42 percent. The
May 15-21 telephone poll of 1,411 registered voters has a margin
of error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.  Father, Son  Former U.S. Representative  Ron Paul  of  Texas , Paul’s
father, ran for president three times and finished third in the
Iowa caucuses in 2012. Rand Paul appeared in the state earlier
this month to speak at an Iowa Republican Party fundraising
dinner, boosting speculation that he may make a White House run.  Vice President Joe Biden, a possible 2016 Democratic
candidate, got 39 percent to Rubio’s 40 percent and trailed Paul
39 percent to 44 percent, the poll showed.  “The major difference between former Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton and Vice President Joseph Biden is that she runs
much better among independent voters, although Senator Rand Paul
runs better among that key group than either Democrat,” Brown
said.  In a hypothetical Clinton-Paul race, the poll showed
Democrats backing her 89 percent to 4 percent, while he led 82
percent to 9 percent among Republicans and 44 percent to 38
percent among independent voters. Clinton won women 53 percent
to 34 percent for Paul. Among men, 49 percent supported Paul to
39 percent for Clinton.  Iowa independent voters backed Paul over Biden 45 percent
to 29 percent, as the vice president took Democrats 80 percent
to 7 percent and lost Republicans 84 percent to 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
