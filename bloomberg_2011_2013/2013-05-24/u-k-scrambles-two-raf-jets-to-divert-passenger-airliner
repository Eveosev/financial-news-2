Two Royal Air Force Typhoon fighter jets have been scrambled to divert a passenger aircraft bound for Manchester International Airport in the north of  England , the U.K. Ministry of Defence said.  The planes took off from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to investigate and divert the aircraft to Stansted Airport, which is the U.K.â€™s designated counter-terrorism base, a spokesman for the ministry said in a telephone interview.  The aircraft may have lost communications and it could be a false alarm, he said, asking not to be identified in line with government policy.
