Temperatures will reach into the 90s
Fahrenheit (low 30s Celsius) from Chicago to Boston as June
arrives, according to  MDA Weather Services .  The high in  New York City  and Boston will reach 90 on June
1 and Washington may see 94, said MDA in Gaithersburg,  Maryland .
 St. Louis  is expected to near 90 on May 29.  From the upper Midwest to New England, temperatures are
expected to be as much as 8 degrees above normal from May 29 to
June 2.  “The strong heat event is still on track,” MDA said today
in its forecast. “Peak temps in the upper 80s to lower 90s
should be common for at least a couple of days for most key
areas of these regions, which for most will equate to the
hottest levels so far this year.”  Higher-than-normal temperatures in large population areas
can spur natural gas demand as more people turn to air
conditioners to keep cool.  Power plants  will account for 32
percent of U.S. gas consumption this year, Energy Information
Administration data show.  East Coast temperatures are expected to remain 3 to 5
degrees above normal June 3 to June 7, while cooler air moves
into the upper Midwest and Great Plains, including Chicago.  The normal average temperature on June 1 in  New York  City
is 68 degrees, according to MDA. In Boston, it’s 63; in Chicago,
64; in Houston, 81; in St. Louis, 72; and in Burbank,
California, 67.  To contact the reporter on this story:
