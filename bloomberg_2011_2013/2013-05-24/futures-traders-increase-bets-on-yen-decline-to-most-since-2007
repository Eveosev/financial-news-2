Futures traders increased bets that
the yen will weaken against the dollar to the most since July
2007 as speculation rises that the U.S. is moving closer to
reducing monetary stimulus.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in  Japan ’s currency
compared with those on a gain, known as net shorts, was 95,186
contracts on May 21 compared with 88,407 a week earlier, figures
from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission
show. Bets that the British pound will decline against the
greenback increased to the most since at least 1992.  Investors are increasingly expecting the  U.S. dollar  to
rally against its most-traded peers amid speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  will reduce its bond-buying program. The yen has
fallen 21 percent against its U.S. counterpart in the past year
as the  Bank of Japan  undertakes an unprecedented stimulus to
double the monetary base in two years as it seeks escape
deflation.  “The main driver of U.S. interest-rates and the dollar is
the expected Fed outlook,” Brian Daingerfield, a currency
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s RBS Securities
unit in  Stamford , Connecticut, said in a telephone interview.
The Fed is “clearly concerned that the market might get too
aggressive in pricing in the end of policy accommodation, when
really what the Fed wants to do is slow the pace of easing.”  Bernanke Speaks  The Dollar Index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, touched 84.498 yesterday, the highest level
since July 2010. The gauge fell 0.1 percent to 83.633 today, and
is forecast to increase to 86.1 by the end of the year,
according to the median forecast of economists and strategists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in testimony to the Joint
Economic Committee of Congress this week that the central bank
may taper monthly bond purchases at its next few meetings if
it’s confident of sustained gains in the economy. Bernanke also
told lawmakers premature tightening of policy may endanger the
recovery.  Net shorts on the British pound rose to 76,976 contracts on
May 21, compared with 65,355 a week earlier. Those on
Australia’s currency increased to to 32,409, from net shorts of
13,450 a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
