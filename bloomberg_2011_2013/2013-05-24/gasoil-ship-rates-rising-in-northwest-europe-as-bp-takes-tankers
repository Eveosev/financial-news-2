Rates to ship gasoil in northwest
 Europe  had this year’s biggest weekly increase after  BP Plc (BP/) 
booked tankers to carry refined fuel from the region to Algeria,
draining vessel supply.  Charter costs for flexi-size ships transporting 22,000
metric tons of the heating fuel to Le Havre, France, from
Ventspils in Latvia climbed 1.9 percent to 189.58 Worldscale
points today, according to data from the London-based Baltic
Exchange. They jumped 17 percent for the week.  Rates advanced on increased bookings by BP of larger
Handysize  oil tankers  to haul refined fuels to the Mediterranean
region, Braemar Seascope Ltd. said in a report. Reduced supply
of Handysizes in northwest Europe boosted rates for competing
flexi-size vessels, the London-based shipbroker said.  While tankers carrying refined fuels can handle cargoes
including gasoline, jet fuel and diesel, most 22,000-ton
shipments on the Ventspils- Le Havre  trade route are gasoil,
according to Braemar. Costs may rise into June, it said.  Toby Odone, a BP spokesman in London, declined to comment
by phone today. The company is Europe’s second-biggest oil
producer. A Handysize vessel can carry about 30,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
