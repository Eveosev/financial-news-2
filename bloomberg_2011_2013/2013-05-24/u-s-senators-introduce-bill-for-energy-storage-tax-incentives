Four U.S. Senators proposed
legislation offering tax incentives to homeowners and companies
that install energy-storage systems in an effort to boost
investment in renewable power.  The bill would provide a 30 percent tax credit, capped at
$1 million per project, to homeowners and businesses that use
power-storage equipment, according to a  statement  today from
Senators  Ron Wyden  and Jeffrey Merkley, Oregon Democrats,  Susan Collins , a  Maine  Republican, and Angus King, an independent from
Maine. Wyden is chairman of the energy and natural resources
committee.  The bill also offers a 20 percent credit, capped at $40
million each, for utility-scale systems, with a total budget of
$1.5 billion in incentives for these large projects.  Wind turbines and solar panels don’t always generate power
when it’s most needed, and storage systems that retain the
energy until demand is higher will facilitate wider use of
renewable energy, the senators said.  “Building out more energy storage will increase the amount
of renewable power on the grid, reduce our country’s need for
new power plants and make the U.S. energy system more
reliable,” Wyden said in the statement. “With all of the
attention given to new sources of power, it’s only appropriate
that  energy storage  gets its time in the sun.”  The threshold for storage systems to qualify for the
incentive was lowered to 5 kilowatt hours from 20 kilowatt hours
in an earlier version of the bill that wasn’t passed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
