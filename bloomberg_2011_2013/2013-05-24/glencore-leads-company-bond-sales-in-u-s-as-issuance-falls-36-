Offerings of corporate bonds in the
U.S. fell 36 percent this week to about $36.5 billion as
relative yields widened.  Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) , the largest publicly traded
commodities supplier, raised $5 billion in a five-part offering
and Luxembourg-based  Intelsat SA (I)  issued $2 billion of 10-year
debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales declined
from last week’s  $57.4 billion  and compare with a 2013 weekly
average of $34.5 billion.  While issuance fell following the busiest week since March
2012, offerings remain poised for a record May as companies race
to lock in borrowing costs at about unprecedented lows. Sales
have reached $156.7 billion this month, on pace to exceed the
$162.6 billion issued in May 2008 and the most since $171
billion in January, Bloomberg data show.  The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures increased to 204 basis points
yesterday from 203 basis points on May 17, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. Spreads have risen after
falling to 201 basis points on May 7, the lowest since October
2007.  As sales slowed before the Memorial Day public holiday in
the U.S., yields increased to 3.51 percent from 3.46 percent on
May 17, and compare with a record low 3.35 percent on May 2,
index data show.  Glencore Offering  Glencore sold $1 billion of 1.7 percent, three-year notes
through its Glencore Funding LLC unit to yield 130 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, $1.5 billion of 2.5
percent debt due January 2019 at a 170 basis-point spread and
$1.5 billion of 4.125 percent, 10-year securities at 210,
Bloomberg data show.  The offering from the Baar, Switzerland-based company also
included $500 million of three-year, floating-rate notes to
yield 116 basis points more than the three-month London
interbank offered rate and an equivalent portion of securities
due January 2019 at 136 basis points more than Libor, the data
show.  Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $23.3
billion, compared with  $40.2 billion  last week and a 2013 weekly
average of  $25.7 billion , Bloomberg data show.  Yields on investment-grade debt rose to 2.83 percent
yesterday from 2.79 percent on May 17, and compare with a record
low 2.65 percent on May 2, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate index. Spreads were unchanged at
142 basis points. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Intelsat Sale  Intelsat, the commercial satellite operator, issued 5.5
percent debt due August 2023 to yield 364 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. It also sold
$635 million of bonds due December 2022.  Offerings of speculative-grade bonds reached at least $13.2
billion, compared with  $17.2 billion  last week and a 2013 weekly
average of  $8.8 billion , Bloomberg data show.  Yields on junk debt rose to 6.12 percent yesterday from
6.07 percent on May 17, and compare with a record low 5.98
percent on May 9, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
U.S. High Yield index. Spreads widened 5 basis points to 442
basis points.  High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
