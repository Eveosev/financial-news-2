U.S.  Gulf Coast  diesel fuel
strengthened to the highest level in a week versus futures as
regional supplies fell and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  repaired a leak at
its Baton Rouge refinery.  Distillate stockpiles on the U.S. Gulf Coast, referred to
as PADD 3, declined 493,000 barrels to 39.2 million in the week
ended May 17, according to U.S. Energy Information
Administration data.  Exxonâ€™s 503,500-barrel-a-day Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
refinery is conducting repairs after a leak associated with
sulfur plant operations, the company said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday.  The discount for  ultra-low-sulfur diesel  on the Gulf Coast
narrowed 0.38 cent to 4.25 cents a gallon below futures on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:12 p.m., the  strongest  since
May 14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Conventional,
85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, advanced 0.25 cent to 24 cents a
gallon under futures.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , fell 36 cents to $19.78 a barrel. The same spread for
Light Louisiana Sweet oil gained 64 cents to $11.53.  To contact the reporter on this story:
