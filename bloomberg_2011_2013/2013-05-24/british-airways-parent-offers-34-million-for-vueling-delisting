British Airways (IAG)  parent IAG SA offered
26.3 million euros ($34 million) for the 9.49 percent of
Barcelona-based  Vueling Airlines SA (VLG)  it doesn’t yet own as the
third-largest European airline seeks to stem losses in Spain.  The delisting offer of 9.25 euros a share values Vueling at
276.6 million euros and matches what International Consolidated
Airlines Group paid when acquiring majority ownership of the
low-cost carrier, the London-based company said in a statement.  IAG bid for control of profitable Vueling after losses at
its Madrid-based Iberia unit led to a 23 million-euro deficit in
2012. Chief Executive Officer Willie Walsh has said Vueling will
remain a standalone unit, with CEO Alex Cruz reporting to him
rather than via Iberia, where 3,000 jobs are being eliminated.  “Vueling will be delisted from the Barcelona, Bilbao,
Madrid and Valencia stock exchanges upon successful completion
of the offer,” IAG today. A meeting of Vueling shareholders has
been called for June 27 to approve the delisting, IAG said.  IAG, which inherited a 45.85 percent stake in Vueling from
Iberia when the group was formed via a merger with BA in 2011,
raised its stake to 90.51 percent after most minority investors
accepted its offer of 9.25 euros a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
