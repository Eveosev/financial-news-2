China ’s overnight money-market rate
dropped for the first time in more than two weeks on speculation
the supply of cash will improve as the central bank pumps
capital into the financial system.  The People’s Bank of China  added  128 billion  yuan  ($20.9
billion) to markets this week, the most since February,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A report yesterday by
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed manufacturing in
China is contracting in May for the first time in seven months.  “Cash supply will improve today,” said Li Jun, a bond
analyst at Bank of Dongguan Co. in Dongguan, a city in the
southern Guangdong province. “The biggest banks are willing to
lend money. PBOC capital injection is helpful.”  The one-day  repurchase rate , a measure of interbank funding
availability, fell 21 basis points to 3.50 percent as of 10:08
a.m. in Shanghai, according to a weighted average rate compiled
by the National Interbank Funding Center. That pared a weekly
increase in the rate, which touched a one-month high of 4
percent yesterday, to 62 basis points, or 0.62 percentage point.  The preliminary reading for a Purchasing Managers’ Index
was 49.6 in May, compared with a final 50.4 for April, according
to HSBC and Markit Economics. A reading of 50 or above signals
expansion.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swap contracts, the
fixed payment to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, was
steady today and this week at 3.28 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
