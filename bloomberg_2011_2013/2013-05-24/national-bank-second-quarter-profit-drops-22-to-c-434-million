National Bank of Canada , the
country’s sixth-largest lender, raised its dividend by 4.8
percent as it posted record second-quarter adjusted profit on
consumer-lending growth.  Profit excluding one-time items rose 7 percent to a record
C$2.08 a share, the Montreal-based bank said today in a
statement, beating the C$1.97  average estimate  of 13 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The lender increased its quarterly
dividend to 87 cents and said its board has authorized the
repurchase of 3.2 million common shares, or 2 percent of
outstanding stock.  “The bank delivered record results thanks to excellent
performance in our three business segments,” Chief Executive
Officer Louis Vachon said in the news release.  Net income declined 22 percent to C$434 million ($420
million), or C$2.49 a share, from a year earlier, when the
company had a C$198 million one-time gain from the April 2012
sale of its Natcan Investment unit, according to the statement.  The results could hurt investors who bet on the shares to
fall, said John Aiken, an analyst at Barclays Plc.  “The results and the dividend increase are likely enough
to potentially generate another short squeeze on NA’s shares
today,” Aiken said in a note to clients, referring to National
Bank’s stock symbol. “We would be surprised if they did not
outperform for at least another session.”  Shares Rise  National Bank rose 1.3 percent to C$76.56 at 9:48 a.m. in
Toronto trading. Shares have declined 0.9 percent this year, the
worst performer among the eight-company Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Commercial Banks Industry Index, which has  advanced  2.6 percent
since Dec. 31.  Profit from commercial lending rose 1.8 percent to C$166
million as personal loans and home-equity lines of credit
increased, the bank said. Wealth-management earnings dropped 78
percent to C$52 million from a year earlier. Excluding the
effect of the Natcan sale, the unit gained 23 percent in the
three months ending April 30 to C$58 million. Capital markets
earnings increased 23 percent to C$143 million.  Toronto-Dominion Bank said yesterday that second-quarter
profit rose 1.8 percent to C$1.72 billion, led by record
earnings from U.S. consumer lending and trading. Earnings
excluding some items were C$1.90, missing by one cent the
 average estimate  of 13 surveyed analysts.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  reports results on May 28, followed by
 Bank of Montreal (BMO)  on May 29. Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s
largest lender, and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the
fifth-biggest, report on May 30.  (National Bank will host a conference call at 11 a.m.
