Naftna Industrija Srbije AD, the
Serbian  oil company  controlled by Russia’s  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) ,
will start exploratory drilling in southern Hungary in
partnership with  Canada ’s  Falcon Oil & Gas Ltd. (FO)   The search for gas at depths of up to 3,300 meters in the
Mako trough will be carried out by DrillTec GUT GmbH of  Germany ,

its website.  Under a January agreement with Falcon, NIS gets 50 percent
of expected net production revenue from the site, in exchange
for covering the costs of the multi-well drilling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
