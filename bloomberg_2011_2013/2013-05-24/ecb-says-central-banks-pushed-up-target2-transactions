The  European Central Bank  said the
value of payments processed through the Target2 payment system
rose last year, partly due to increased activity by central
banks.  Target2 processed a total of 634 trillion euros ($820
trillion) in payments in 2012, 3.5 percent more than the year
before, the Frankfurt-based central bank said in its Target
Annual Report published today. “Operations involving central
banks, in particular in the first half of the year, were
responsible for part of this increase,” the ECB said.  A total of 90.6 million transactions were settled in
Target2 in 2012, an increase of 1.2 percent from 2011, it said.
60 percent of the transactions were customer transactions and
the remaining 40 percent accounted for operations between banks
or central banks.  “Target2 continues to be instrumental in promoting an
integrated euro-area money market, which is a prerequisite for
the effective conduct of the single monetary policy and
contributes to the integration of the euro-area financial
markets and, ultimately, to financial stability,” the ECB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
