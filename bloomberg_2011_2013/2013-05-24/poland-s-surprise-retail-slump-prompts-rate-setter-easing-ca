Polish  retail sales  unexpectedly fell
in April, prompting central bank policy maker Elzbieta Chojna-Duch to call for a “cautious” interest-rate cut next month as
prospects for prompt economic recovery fade.  Sales dropped 0.2 percent from a year earlier as consumers
spent less on food and fuels, the statistics office said today.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 29 economists was
for a 1.1 percent increase after sales rose 0.1 percent the
previous month. Retail sales declined 2.7 percent from March.  Policy makers have cut  interest rates  by 175 basis points
since November to a record-low 3 percent as the European Union’s
largest eastern economy expanded at the slowest pace in four
years in the first quarter. The retail report shows the “lack
of economic recovery” after the  inflation rate  dropped to
seven-month low, Chojna-Duch told reporters in parliament today.  “The data will definitely lend support to the proponents
of monetary easing,” Monika Kurtek, chief economist at Bank
Pocztowy SA in Warsaw, said in an e-mail. “The policy makers
are mainly focused on prospects for inflation right now and
everything points to its further decline in the coming months.”  Polish derivatives investors are betting on 44 basis points
of cuts through August, according to the gap between three-month
forward-rate agreements and the Warsaw Interbank Offered Rate.
The zloty weakened 0.1 percent to 4.2027 per euro at 1:40 p.m.
in Warsaw and headed for its second weekly decline.  The  International Monetary Fund  last week urged policy
makers to lower borrowing costs “without delay” as the euro
area’s longest-ever recession curbs demand for Polish exports.  Andrzej Bratkowski, one of the 10 members of the Monetary
Policy Council, will seek a half-point cut next month as the
optimal level for borrowing costs is “2 percent to 2.5
percent,” he said in a May 22 interview.  Asked about the possibility of a 50 basis-point reduction
at the June 4-5 meeting, Chojna-Duch said that the “cut should
be more cautious and we should wait with a deeper reduction
until we see July projection.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
