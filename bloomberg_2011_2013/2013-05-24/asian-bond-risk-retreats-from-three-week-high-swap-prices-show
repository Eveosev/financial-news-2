The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
fell from the highest level in three weeks, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 1 basis point to 106 basis
points as of 8:21 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge is set for its biggest
weekly increase in nine weeks, and yesterday rose to the highest
since May 2, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 3.5 basis points to
81.25 basis points as of 9:20 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. prices. The benchmark climbed 8.33 basis points
yesterday to 82.33, the steepest increase this year, according
to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 0.5 basis point
to 103.5 as of 11:07 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. prices. The measure also touched a three-week high
yesterday, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
