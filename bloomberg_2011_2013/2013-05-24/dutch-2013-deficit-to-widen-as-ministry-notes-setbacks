The Dutch  budget deficit  will widen
to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year from an
earlier forecast of 2.6 percent as rising unemployment and lower
 consumer spending  reduces government income.  “The 2013 budget is characterized by setbacks,” the
Ministry of Finance in The Hague said in a letter to parliament
today. The forecast is in line with the most recent estimate by
the Central Planning Bureau, or CPB.  The Netherlands, which has been in breach of European Union
deficit rules since 2009, is trying to get its deficit below 3
percent of GDP again with a four-year, 16 billion-euro ($21
billion) austerity package agreed on by the coalition government
in October. The Cabinet led by Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  will
decide later this year on additional measures of 4.3 billion
euros needed to meet the target next year.  Rutte said yesterday at a joint news conference with German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  that he won’t ask for more time to meet
the 2014 deficit target. Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem
said on May 15 that the “the economy has reached bottom” and
that he still expects a recovery in the second half of 2013. The
European Commission is set to issue recommendations for the
Netherlands on May 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
