U.K. police arrested and released a
fifth suspect, a 31-year-old woman, as part of their
investigation of the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby.  The suspect was arrested at a home in south  London  last
night on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, the  Metropolitan
Police Service  said in an e-mailed statement.  The force said it released one of two suspects arrested
yesterday on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, a 29-year-old
woman, without charging her. The other suspect, a 29-year-old
man, remains in custody.  Two suspects who were shot by police and arrested at the
scene remain in the hospital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
