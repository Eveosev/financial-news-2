Kenya Airways Ltd.,  Africa ’s fifth-biggest carrier, started marketing a $2 billion loan that will
be used to expand its fleet.  The debt will fund the purchase of 10  Boeing Co. (BA)  and 10
 Embraer SA (EMBR3)  aircraft, Obi Emekekwu, a spokesman for arranger
African Export-Import Bank, wrote in an e-mail. U.S. Ex-Im Bank
is backing the Boeing deal and Afreximbank is being advised by
EM Finance Consulting on syndication of the loan, he said.  The financing includes a $300 million portion to be used
for pre-delivery payments loaned over a seven-year period and
the remainder will be paid back over 10 years, Kenya Airways’
Finance Director Alex Mbugua said last year. The longer loan
includes senior- and junior-ranking portions, Emekekwu said.  Kenya Airways plans to triple the size of its fleet to 107
aircraft and more than double the number of routes it flies as
part of a 10-year expansion plan, it said in March 2012.  The country’s government owns 30 percent of the airline and
Air France-KLM Group is its largest shareholder with a 26
percent stake, Emekekwu said. It operates from Nairobi’s Jomo
Kenyatta International Airport.  To contact the reporter on this story:
