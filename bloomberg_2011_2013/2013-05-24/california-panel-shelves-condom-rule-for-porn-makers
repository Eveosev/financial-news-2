A  California  Assembly committee set
aside a bill that would have required actors in pornographic
productions to wear condoms and other protective gear.  The adult-film industry, which says it  employs  10,000
people in the state and adds more than $1 billion to the local
economy, threatened to move production out of California if the
bill became law.  The bill was put on hold by the Assembly Appropriations
Committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
