Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  recommended
selling West Texas Intermediate crude and buying North Sea Brent
contracts for December 2014 as supplies accumulate on the U.S.
 Gulf Coast .  The discount on WTI for delivery in December 2014 against
the equivalent Brent contract has narrowed to $8.38 a barrel
from $10.11 a month ago. The spread should widen as pipelines
carrying crude out of the U.S. storage hub in Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
cause a build-up on the Gulf Coast that would lower the price of
WTI versus the European benchmark, Goldman said.  “If an oversupply of light, sweet crude in the U.S. Gulf
coast becomes a problem as soon as third quarter 2013, it should
be an even bigger problem in 2014,” analysts  Jeffrey Currie  and
Stefan Wieler in  New York  said in a report today.  The discount on front-month WTI against Brent, at $8.44 a
barrel today, is still set to narrow toward $5 in the third
quarter as new pipeline capacity to move oil out of Cushing
causes stockpiles there to decline “substantially,” Goldman
said. Booming U.S. production expanded the discount on WTI to
more than $28 a barrel in October, 2011.  Refinery maintenance and reduced pipeline flows are
“putting a drag on a more meaningful decline of Cushing
inventories,” according to the report. Supplies at Cushing
increased by 0.9 percent to 50.2 million barrels in the week to
May 17, according to the Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
