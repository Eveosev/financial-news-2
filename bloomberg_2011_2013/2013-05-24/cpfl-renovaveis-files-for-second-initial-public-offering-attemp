CPFL Energias Renovaveis SA, the
renewable-energy unit of Brazilian power utility  CPFL Energia
SA (CPFE3) , has registered for an initial public offering seven months
after pulling plans to sell shares due to “market conditions.”  The transaction will be subject to conditions of national
and international capital markets, the Sao Paulo-based company
said yesterday in a filing with stock market regulator Comissao
de Valores Mobiliarios.  The company canceled plans to hold an IPO on Oct. 4,
according to a previous filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
