China ’s  yuan  strengthened to a 19-year high after the central bank set a record reference rate for
the currency and Premier  Li Keqiang  reiterated the country was
making progress in opening up its capital account.  The nation is steadily pushing forward market-oriented
reform on  interest rates  and capital-account convertibility,
according to an article that Li signed and published in Neue
Zuricher Zeitung, a German-language Swiss newspaper. Industrial
and Commercial Bank of China Ltd.’s Singapore branch said
yesterday it will start offering yuan clearing services from May
27. The People’s Bank of China raised the daily fixing 0.13
percent to 6.1867 per dollar.  “The PBOC fixing and more adoption of yuan in offshore
markets are positive for the exchange rate,” said Bruce Yam, a
foreign-exchange strategist at Sun Hung Kai Financial Ltd. in
Hong Kong. “There continues to be capital flowing into China,
driving demand for the currency.”  The yuan rose 0.04 percent today to close at 6.1316 per
dollar in  Shanghai , extending its weekly advance to 0.17 percent,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It touched
6.1276, the strongest level since the government unified
official and market rates at the end of 1993. The spot rate is
allowed to diverge a maximum 1 percent on either side of the
fixing.  Growth Concern  China’s manufacturing is set to shrink in May for the first
time in seven months, according to data released yesterday by
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. A preliminary reading
for a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 49.6, which compares with a
final reading of 50.4 for April and is below the 50 level that
marks the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  “Investors should be aware of risks in the second half as
slowing growth could precipitate debt problems,” Yam said.
“That could lead to some yuan depreciation.”  Trading in gold using the Chinese currency has tripled in
 Hong Kong  this year as the yuan’s rally to a 19-year high helps
limits risks for jewelers, Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange
Soceity president Haywood Cheung said in a May 15 interview.  In Hong Kong, the offshore yuan climbed 0.1 percent to
6.1245 per dollar today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It gained 0.3 percent since May 17, the eighth consecutive
weekly advance. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards advanced
0.11 percent to 6.2285, a 1.6 percent discount to the onshore
spot rate.  One-month implied volatility in the yuan, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
increased 26 basis points, or 0.26 percentage point, this week
to 2.07 percent. It rose four basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
