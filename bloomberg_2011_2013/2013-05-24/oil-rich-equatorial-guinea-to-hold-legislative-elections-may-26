Equatorial Guinea , sub-Saharan
Africa’s third-biggest oil producer, will hold legislative and
municipal elections on May 26, according to the government’s
website.  Voters will for the first time elect 55 members of a 70-seat Senate established under a revised constitution. The
remaining 15 senators will be appointed directly by President
Teodoro Obiang Nguema, Africa’s longest-serving ruler.  Crude accounts for more than 90 percent of government
revenue in Equatorial Guinea, while U.S. oil companies including
 ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Hess Corp. (HES)  are the biggest investors in the
Spanish-speaking nation, according to the U.S. State Department.  The ruling Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea, known by
its Spanish acronym PDGE, together with three small, allied
parties won the last legislative elections in 2008 with 99 out
of 100 seats.  Human rights groups including London-based Amnesty
International and New York-based Human Rights Watch said earlier
this month that campaigning had been marred by harassment of the
opposition, reports of voter intimidation and the denial of free
speech to political groups.  The secretary-general of the PDGE, Lucas Nguema Esono, said
yesterday that preparations for the vote had been “carried out
in a good atmosphere” and there had been no incidents,
according to  website . The  African Union  has sent 40 observers to
monitor the vote, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
