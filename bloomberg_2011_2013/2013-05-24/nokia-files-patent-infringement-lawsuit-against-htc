Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  sued rival mobile-phone
maker  HTC Corp. (2498)  for selling products in the U.S., including the
HTC One handset, that allegedly infringe three of its patents.  The three patents pertain to “terminal, method and
computer program product for interacting with a signaling tag,”
according to the complaint Nokia filed yesterday in federal
court in  San Diego . The Espoo, Finland-based company seeks a
court order halting the alleged infringement and unspecified
damages.  Nokia, which lost its 14-year title as world’s biggest
seller of mobile phones to Samsung Electronics Co. in 2011, is
trying to expand revenue from its patent portfolio. The company
last year  sued  Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC in the U.S. and in
Germany over alleged patent infringement.  “Upon receiving the official document, HTC is to consider
all legal options to protect our rights,” the Taiwanese company
said in an e-mailed statement today.  HTC  shares  fell 2 percent to NT$277 as of 12:41 p.m. in
Taipei trading, headed for the lowest close since April 23.  The case is Nokia Oyj v. HTC Corp., 13-1231, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of California (San Diego).  -- With reporting by Tim Culpan in Taipei. Editors: Peter
