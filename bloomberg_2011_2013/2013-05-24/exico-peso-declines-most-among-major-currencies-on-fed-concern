Mexico ’s peso fell the most among
major currencies as an increase in U.S. durable goods orders
added to speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will curtail a
stimulus program that has boosted emerging-market assets.  The peso depreciated 1.1 percent to 12.5311 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:20 a.m. in Mexico City, its biggest decline on a closing
basis since April 15. The drop was the largest among the 16
most-traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The peso has fallen
1.5 percent since May 17 in a third weekly drop, the longest
stretch of losses since November.  Mexico’s statistics agency reported that the  unemployment
rate  rose to 5.04 percent in April from 4.51 percent and the
central bank reported a deeper-than-forecast $5.532 billion
current account deficit in the first quarter.  “We recommend caution in the short term in long peso
positions,” Juan Carlos Alderete, a strategist at Grupo
Financiero Banorte SAB, said today in an e-mailed research
report. A long position is a bet an asset will gain in value.  U.S. durable goods orders increased 3.3 percent last month
after dropping 5.9 percent in March, the Commerce Department
reported today in  Washington . The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 1.5 percent increase. Mexico
sends about 80 percent of its exports to its northern neighbor.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell less than one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.98 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.04
centavo to 144.07 centavos per peso. The yields have increased
27 basis points this week and climbed yesterday to 4.99 percent,
the highest level since April 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
