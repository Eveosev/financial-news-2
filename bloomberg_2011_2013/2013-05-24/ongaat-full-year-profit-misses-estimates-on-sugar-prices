Tongaat Hulett Ltd. (TON) , South Africa’s
second-largest sugar producer by market value, reported full-year profit that missed analyst estimates as earnings growth
slowed amid a decline in world sugar prices.  Net income in the 12 months through March rose 20 percent
to 1.07 billion rand ($112 million) from 889 million rand a year
earlier, the Mount Edgecombe, South Africa-based company said
today in a statement. Per-share earnings excluding one-time
items climbed 15 percent to 9.42 rand, missing the 10.82-rand
average of six analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings
jumped 27 percent in the six months ended September.  “The advantage of higher overall sugar production volumes
with the related benefits in the unit costs of production were
offset partially by continued general margin pressure in the
relationship of selling price movements versus higher input
costs,” Tongaat said.  Sugar output increased 9 percent in fiscal 2013 compared
with 14 percent a year earlier, the company said. Tongaat, with
operations in  Swaziland ,  Mozambique ,  Zimbabwe  and  South Africa ,
estimated on Nov. 12 that full-year production would rise 14
percent.  World sugar prices are at their lowest level in three
years, and the market is oversupplied, Chief Executive Officer
Peter Staude said in the statement. Sugar for delivery in July,
the most actively traded contract, slumped 20 percent over the
last 12 months and traded 0.7 percent higher at 16.76 cents a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. today.  The company plans to raise the dividend 17 percent to 3.40
rand a share from 2.40 rand the previous year.  Tongaat has  fallen  4.6 percent this year in Johannesburg
trading, compared with a 1.7 percent decline in the 10-stock
FTSE/JSE Africa Food Producers Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
