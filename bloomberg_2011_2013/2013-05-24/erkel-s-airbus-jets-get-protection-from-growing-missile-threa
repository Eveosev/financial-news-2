Airbus SAS (EAD)  planes used by German
Chancellor Angela Merkel will be equipped with a system to
safeguard them from attack by heat-seeking missiles.  The two ACJ319s, business jet versions of the A319 short-haul plane, will be equipped with Northrop Grumman Corp.’s
large-aircraft infrared countermeasure system under a $26
million contract, the U.S. Department of Defense said.  Conflicts in the  Middle East  and North Africa have raised
concern that shoulder-fired missiles able to lock onto  aircraft
engines  will become more readily available to terrorists.
Germany, which has 4,200 troops supporting NATO operations in
Afghanistan, will also carry out medical evacuation flights with
the planes, which have a range of 4,100 nautical miles.  The Pentagon said May 15 it was in talks with Oman and
Qatar to install the  Northrop Grumman (NOC)  system on head-of-state
aircraft including Boeing Co. 747-8s. Other buyers include
Morocco and Saudi Arabia, contract notices show.  Airbus, based in Toulouse, France, declined to comment on
the German upgrade, which the Pentagon said in a statement
yesterday will be completed by March 31, 2016.  The planes have been in their current role since 2010,
according to the website of the German  air force  or Luftwaffe.  Two missiles fired at a Boeing 757 chartered by Arkia
Israeli Airlines Ltd. as it took off from Mombasa, Kenya, in
2002, missed their target. An Airbus A300 freighter operating
for DHL was forced to make an emergency landing in Baghdad a
year later after being struck by a missile.  To contact the reporter on this story:
