Asian currencies had a third weekly
loss on concern the  Federal Reserve  will scale back stimulus
that has spurred fund flows to  emerging markets .  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index touched a six-week
low yesterday after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said May 22 its $85 billion a month of bond-buying, known as
quantitative easing, may be tapered if the  U.S. economy  shows a
sustained improvement. The  yuan  reached a 19-year high today as
the central bank set a record fixing even after data indicated
manufacturing in Asia’s largest economy will contract in May.  The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the 10 most-active
currencies excluding the yen, fell 0.1 percent this week to
117.31 as of 4:14 p.m. in Hong Kong. India’s rupee declined 1.1
percent to 55.50 per dollar, South Korea’s won dropped 0.9
percent to 1,127.05 and the Philippine peso fell 1 percent to
41.595. The yuan rose 0.19 percent to 6.1302. Financial markets
in Thailand and  Malaysia  are closed today for holidays.  “Investors prefer to hold safer assets after Bernanke’s
comments on the QE exit plan,” said Son Eun Jeong, an analyst
at Woori Futures Co. in Seoul.  The won had a third weekly decline, the longest losing
streak since the period ending March 22. Bank of Korea Governor
Kim Choong Soo said today a possible U.S. exit from its stimulus
program would cause volatility in other nations. The Dollar
Index, which tracks the greenback against the currencies of six
major trading partners, touched a 2010 high yesterday.  Chinese Manufacturing  A preliminary reading of the Chinese Purchasing Managers’
Index fell to 49.6 in May, according to HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics yesterday. That compares with the 50.4 median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Fifty is the dividing line
between expansion and contraction.  The peso was poised for its biggest decline since the five
days ended Aug. 17. The drop is due to “dominant external
factors” including the Chinese manufacturing report and the Fed
comments, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco
said today.  Chinese Premier  Li Keqiang  reiterated the country was
making progress in opening up its capital account. Industrial
and Commercial Bank of  China  Ltd.’s Singapore branch said
yesterday it will start offering yuan clearing services from May
27. The PBOC raised the  daily fixing  0.13 percent to 6.1867 per
dollar, a record since a peg to the greenback ended in July 2005.  “The PBOC fixing and more adoption of yuan in offshore
markets are positive for the exchange rate,” said Bruce Yam, a
foreign-exchange strategist at Sun Hung Kai Financial Ltd. in
Hong Kong. “There continues to be capital flowing into China,
driving demand for the currency.”  Taiwan Forwards  Taiwan dollar forwards are set for their biggest weekly
advance in a month as a plan to cut taxes on stock investments
attracted global funds to the island’s shares. Overseas funds
bought $107 million more local equities than they sold this week
through yesterday, taking inflows this year to $4.9 billion,
according to exchange data. One-month non-deliverable forwards
rose 0.5 percent this week to NT$29.932 per dollar. The spot
climbed 0.1 percent to NT$30.03.  Elsewhere in Asia this week, Indonesia’s rupiah dropped 0.2
percent to 9,775 per dollar and Vietnam’s dong was little
changed at 20,995. Malaysia’s ringgit fell 0.4 percent to 3.033
yesterday and the  Thai baht  declined 0.3 percent to 29.95.  To contact the reporters on this story:
