Wockhardt Ltd. (WPL) , an Indian maker of
insulin and hepatitis vaccine, was poised for its biggest ever
two-day drop in Mumbai trading after U.S. regulators imposed
 restrictions  on imports of some of the company’s products.  The  shares  fell 11 percent to 1,172 rupees as of 10:42 a.m.
in Mumbai, extending their two-day drop to 29 percent. The stock
jumped more than fivefold last year.  The  Food and Drug Administration  issued an import alert for
products from Wockhardt’s Waluj facility in Aurangabad because
they didn’t meet good manufacturing practices, according to a
statement on the U.S. regulator’s website.  Wockhardt in an April 15  statement  on its website said the
FDA had carried out an inspection at its unit manufacturing
injectables for export in Aurangabad. The agency had issued form
483s, a note given to company management when inspectors see
conditions that may violate the U.S. Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.  The Indian drugmaker at the time said it is “fully
committed to follow strong quality current good manufacturing
practices system” and that it had started a “comprehensive
remedial measure of the observations of the U.S. FDA.”  Daryl Suchitha, a spokesman for the Mumbai-based company,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail and a phone call seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
