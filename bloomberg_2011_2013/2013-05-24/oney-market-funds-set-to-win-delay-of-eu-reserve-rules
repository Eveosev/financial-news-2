Money-market funds may win more time
to comply with planned European Union rules requiring them to
hoard cash reserves, a person familiar with the talks said.  The European Commission is considering whether to extend a
draft timetable for funds that maintain a fixed share price to
build up a cash “buffer” equivalent to 3 percent of their
assets, on concerns that a short deadline could harm businesses’
access to finance, said the person, who asked not to be named
because the negotiations are private.  An early draft of the plans, seen by  Bloomberg News , would
have required funds to comply with the measure six months after
the final version of the law is published, following agreement
by legislators. Under a revised version being considered by the
commission, that may increase to as long as three years, the
person said.  Regulators are working to impose tighter restrictions on
money-market mutual funds since the September 2008 collapse of
the $62.5 billion Reserve Primary Fund. Its failure, caused by
losses on debt issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
triggered a wider run on money funds that helped freeze global
credit markets.  Funds with fixed share prices have come in for particular
attention from regulators, as they give “an impression of
safety even though MMFs are subject to credit,  interest rate  and
 liquidity risk ,” the International Organization of Securities
Commissions said last year. The failure of one fund to honor
this commitment can put pressure on others, and “trigger a
run” that destabilizes the financial system, IOSCO said.  The commission’s proposals, once they are published, will
need approval by governments and by the European Parliament
before they can become law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
