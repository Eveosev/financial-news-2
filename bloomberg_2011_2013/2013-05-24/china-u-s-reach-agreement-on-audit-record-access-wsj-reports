China  agreed to give a U.S. regulator
access to documents from Chinese accounting firms, moving toward
a resolution of a dispute that could have pushed the country’s
companies to stop trading on U.S. markets.  The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the China
Securities Regulatory Commission and China’s Ministry of Finance
signed the agreement May 7, the ministry said in a statement on
its website today. The deal is a step toward resolving other
disputes including one with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, PCAOB Chairman James Doty was quoted as saying by
the Wall Street Journal, which  reported  the agreement earlier
today.  The SEC last year accused affiliates of the world’s top
four auditing firms of withholding documents from investigators
probing potential fraud by China-based companies. Auditors that
don’t comply with the regulator’s demands face temporary or
permanent deregistration in the U.S., according to the rule
under which the proceedings were brought, meaning they wouldn’t
be able to audit U.S.-listed companies.  Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu CPA Ltd., Ernst & Young Hua Ming
LLP, KPMG Huazhen and and PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian CPAs
Ltd. refused to cooperate with accounting investigations into
nine companies whose securities are traded in the U.S., the SEC
said in an administrative order in December. BDO China Dahua Co.
was also named by the SEC in the action.  The auditors had said Chinese law prevented them from
meeting the SEC’s demands.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
