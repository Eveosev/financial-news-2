Vantage Power Ltd., a U.K. company
founded by two engineering graduates who drove from  Alaska  to
Argentina in an electric car, plans to be fitting its hybrid
engines into 1,000 double-decker buses a year by 2017.  The company has a contract with Ensignbus Co., the U.K.’s
biggest used bus dealer, to start installing the engines for
testing in its fleet toward the end of this year, said Alex
Schey, Vantage’s 25 year-old co-founder. The electric-diesel
motors cut emissions and fuel costs by 40 percent, he said.  “In 2017, a mid-term goal, we want to be selling a
thousand units a year plus,” he said by phone. “The industry
is going through such massive growth around the world, with so
few players having a significant market share, that there really
is that opportunity.”  Vantage is seeking to benefit from Britain’s drive to clean
up its transportation systems as it seeks to reduce emissions by
80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050. London Mayor  Boris Johnson 
said in February that all buses in the city center will have
hybrid engines by 2020.  A new hybrid bus costs upwards of 288,000 pounds while
Vantage’s B320 system costs 60,000 to 70,000 pounds and reduces
fuel costs by 20,000 pounds a year, Schey said.  The London-based company has raised about 800,000 pounds
($1.2 million) from private equity investors including Qi3 Ltd.,
Synergy Energy and government funds and is targeting further
fundraising in 2014, he said.  Vantage was founded in 2011 after Schey and fellow Imperial
College London university mechanical engineering graduate Toby
Schulz, 27, traveled the 26,000-kilometer (16,155-mile) Pan-American Highway from Alaska’s  Prudhoe Bay  to the world’s
southernmost city, Ushuaia, in  Argentina , in an electric sports
car they designed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
