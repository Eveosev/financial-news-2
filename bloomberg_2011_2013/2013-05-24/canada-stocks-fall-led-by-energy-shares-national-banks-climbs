Canadian  stocks  rose, erasing earlier
losses of as much as 0.3 percent to clinch a fifth week of
gains, as a surge in  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX) 
offset a slump in oil and gold producers.  Valeant jumped 13 percent to an 11-year high after a person
familiar with negotiations said  Canada ’s largest drugmaker might
pay $9 billion to buy Bausch & Lomb. Manitoba Telecom Services
Inc. surged 5.7 percent after agreeing to sell its Allstream
unit to a firm co-founded by Egyptian billionaire  Naguib Sawiris . Encana Corp. fell 0.7 percent as oil capped its biggest
weekly decline in more than a month. Banro Corp. and OceanaGold
Corp. slid more than 3.9 percent as gold retreated.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 9.13 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 12,667.22 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The benchmark
equity gauge’s 0.4 percent gain in the past five days gave it
the longest streak of weekly advances since February 2012.  “The S&P/TSX has been pretty quiet while other markets
have been swinging a lot,” said Stephen Gauthier, chief
investment officer with Fin-XO Securities Inc. in  Montreal . The
firm manages C$500 million ($484 million). “Commodities are
falling. We’re seeing oil is down, as is gold. The  U.S. economy 
has been doing pretty well, so it’s providing a bit of a floor
to markets.”  Canadian equities traded as low as 0.3 percent as energy
and raw-material shares retreated amid a slump in oil and gold
prices. Seven of 10 industries in the S&P/TSX declined, as five
stocks fell for every three that rose.  Valeant Deal  Valeant surged 13 percent to C$87, its highest close since
January 2002, pacing an 8.7 percent increase among health-care
stocks. Warburg Pincus LLC, which bought Bausch & Lomb in a 2007
leveraged buyout, as recently as March was considering an
initial public offering, but is now near a deal to sell to
Valeant, said a person who asked not to be identified because
the negotiations are private.  Manitoba Telecom (MBT)  gained 5.7 percent to C$33.93 after
selling its Allstream fiber network business to Accelero Capital
Holdings for C$520 million. The company will use the cash to
invest in new wireless spectrum and improve the speed of its
existing networks, Manitoba Telecom said in a statement.  National Bank of Canada , the country’s sixth-largest
lender, advanced 1.9 percent to C$77.02 after reporting record
second-quarter adjusted profit and raising its  dividend  4.8
percent.  Niko Resources Ltd. jumped 23 percent to C$7.35, for its
biggest gain since 1996. Niko, along with partners Reliance
Industries Ltd. and BP Plc, announced today they have discovered
gas and condensate in a well off the east coast of  India . Niko
holds a 10 percent stake in the block where the discovery was
made.  Banro slipped 3.9 percent to C$1 and OceanaGold sank 4.9
percent to C$1.76 as gold for June delivery retreated for the
third time in four days.  Encana fell 0.7 percent to C$20.28 and Suncor Energy Inc.
declined 1.1 percent to C$31.95 as the price of crude for July
delivery retreated 10 cents to $94.15 a barrel. Oil slid 1.9
percent this week, the most since the seven days ended April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
