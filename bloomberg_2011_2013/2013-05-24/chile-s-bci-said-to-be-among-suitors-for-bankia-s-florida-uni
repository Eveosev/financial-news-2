Chilean lender  Banco de Credito e
Inversiones  is among bidders vying to buy the  Bankia (BKIA)  group’s
bank in Florida, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  BCI is among the bidders, which also include  Banco do
Brasil SA ,  Latin America ’s biggest bank by assets, one of the
people, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn’t public, said today. Bankia’s board was scheduled to meet
at 5 p.m.  Madrid  time to discuss the sale of the Florida bank.  A spokesman for Bankia in Madrid, who asked not to be named
in line with company policy, declined to comment. Santiago-based
BCI declined to comment, according to an external spokesman, who
also asked not be named, citing company policy. A spokesman for
Banco do Brasil wasn’t immediately available for comment.  Bankia is selling City National Bank of  Florida  and other
non-core assets under the terms of a 22 billion-euro ($28
billion) European Union rescue last year. Caja Madrid, the
lender that led a seven-way merger of savings banks in 2010 to
form Bankia, acquired City National in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
