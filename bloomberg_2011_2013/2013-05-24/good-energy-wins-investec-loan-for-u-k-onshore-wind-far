Good Energy Group Plc (GOOD) , a British
renewable-power supplier, won a 10.6 million-pound ($16 million)
loan from  Investec Plc (INVP)  to build a wind farm in northern  England .  The non-recourse loan will finance the 8.2-megawatt project
in Hampole near Doncaster, Wiltshire-based Good Energy said
today in a statement. The loan is in place for 17 years with
potential for a refinancing, Juliet Davenport, chief executive
officer, said by phone. Good Energy will provide the balance of
the 16 million-pound project cost.  The park with four turbines made by REpower Systems SE of
Germany will generate enough power for 4,800 homes a year when
itâ€™s commissioned as expected early next year. Good Energy has a
200-megawatt pipeline of renewable energy projects in the early
stage of development that the company plans to advance this
year, Davenport said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
