China’s government said that
“deepening reform” in 2013 will include making a plan for
urbanization, boosting private investment and gradually
loosening restrictions on  interest rates .  The nation will expand property-tax trials and push toward
capital-account convertibility for the  yuan , according to a
State Council statement on the central government’s website,
which showed that policy makers are sticking with previously
announced goals.  Premier  Li Keqiang  has pledged an expanded role for market
forces in the world’s second-biggest economy to sustain growth
as the population ages and higher costs weigh on exports. In a
May 13 speech, Li signaled that policy makers are reluctant to
use stimulus to counter a slowdown.  “The new government is moving in the right direction, with
a focus on reform instead of stimulus,” said Chang Jian, a Hong
Kong-based economist at Barclays Plc who formerly worked for the
 World Bank . “At the same time, reform can’t be completed
overnight -- all these changes will involve repeated discussions
and negotiations.”  The government also highlighted efforts to control local-government debt risks and to promote private investment in the
finance, energy, rail and telecommunication industries.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
