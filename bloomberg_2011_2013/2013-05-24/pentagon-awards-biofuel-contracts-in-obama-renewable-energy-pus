The U.S. Defense Department issued
three contracts totaling $16 million for biofuel plants intended
to help power fighter jets and destroyers by 2016.  The awards to three closely held firms are part of a drive
by the administration of President  Barack Obama  to boost
investment in renewable energy.  The contracts will be matched by more than $17 million in
investments by the contractors, Sharon Burke, assistant
secretary of defense for operational energy, said today in a
telephone interview. The companies will develop plans for
refineries capable of supplying at least 150 million gallons of
biofuel for less than $4 a gallon, she said.  “We see a national security benefit in global
diversification of liquid fuels,” Burke said. The department
hopes the effort will “catalyze greater production of these
fuels across our economy,” she said.  The contractors are Emerald Biofuels LLC, based in Golf,
 Illinois ; Natures BioReserve LLC in South Sioux City,  Nebraska ;
and Fulcrum Brighton Biofuels LLC in Pleasanton,  California .  The companies have proposed making fuel from materials such
as animal fats, food-processing waste and oil-seed crops,
according to the Pentagon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
