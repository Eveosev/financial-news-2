3i Group Plc (III)  said it offered to buy
 Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s European infrastructure-fund business as the
U.K.’s biggest publicly traded private-equity firm seeks to
boost investments in the region’s physical assets.  Barclays Infrastructure Funds Management Ltd. has 780
million pounds ($1.2 billion) of assets under management,
London-based 3i said in a statement today, without disclosing
the offer price. The transaction is subject to an employee
consultation process, it said.  “This strategic move is further evidence of our commitment
to grow further and develop our infrastructure business and to
increase our income from third-party assets under management,”
Chief Executive Officer Simon Burrows said in the statement. The
firm said it plans to “leverage” BIFM to raise new funds.  3i is seeking to boost its third-party fee income by
increasing assets under management following a period of cost
cutting and returning money to investors. For investors,
infrastructure projects offer long-term stable returns that are
typically protected by some form of government guarantee. The
 International Monetary Fund  this week urged the U.K. to spend
more money on infrastructure to boost growth.  BIFM raised its first fund in 1996 and was one of the first
to invest in the public-private partnership infrastructure
market, 3i said. The unit has invested 1.7 billion pounds across
six funds to date, it said.  A Barclays spokesman declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
