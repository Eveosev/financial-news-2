A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
rose for a third day before data on durable goods orders.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased 1
basis point to a mid-price of 74.3 basis points at 8:12 a.m. in
 New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The measure
is poised to close at its highest level since May 2.  Bookings for  goods  meant to last at least three years
probably increased 1.5 percent in April, according to the median
 estimate  of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before the 8:30 a.m.
report from the Commerce Department in  Washington . Investors are
watching economic data for signs growth is strong enough to
prompt the  Federal Reserve  to taper its $85 billion in monthly
bond-buying.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
