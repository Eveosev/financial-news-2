First National Bank , the retail-banking unit of  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , said it wants to find a black
executive to replace Jacques Celliers when he steps down as head
of business banking at the end of this year.  “The position he’s vacating -- we hope to fill it with a
black CEO,” FNB Chief Executive Officer Michael Jordaan said in
a phone interview from Johannesburg today. We are “committed to
transformation -- it’s part of doing business in South Africa
and it’s the right thing to do,” he said.  Celliers, 41, will take over from Jordaan, who announced
his resignation two days ago after 10 years as FNB CEO.  South African companies are obliged to hire and mentor
black people as part of an initiative that aims to redress some
of the discrimination under the white-minority apartheid regime
that ended in 1994. FirstRand’s Sizwe Nxasana became the first
black CEO of one of  South Africa ’s four big banks in 2010.  “We think about our commitment to transformation all the
time,” Nxasana said on May 22. While the process of finding a
replacement for Celliers is just beginning, FirstRand “likes
growing our own timber,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
