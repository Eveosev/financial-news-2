The Australian dollar may fall to its
lowest level in more than 19 months if it continues a weakening
trend and breaches a key support level, according to Credit
Suisse AG, citing technical indicators.  The Aussie may decline to 93.88 U.S. cents, its weakest
level since Oct. 4, 2011, if it falls below 95.75, and then
94.88,  David Sneddon , a technical analyst at Credit Suisse in
 London , wrote today in a note to clients. The currency may first
correct upwards, capping at 99.90, according to Sneddon. The
Aussie has been the worst-performing major currency this
quarter, decreasing 7.5 percent versus the  U.S. dollar .  “The Aussie-dollar has extended its aggressive collapse,”
Sneddon wrote. “We continue to look for this to hold for now,
and for a corrective phase to emerge ahead of the downtrend
eventually resuming.”  Australia’s currency depreciated 1.1 percent to 96.48 U.S.
cents at 2:28 p.m. in  New York  after earlier falling as much as
1.2 percent. The Aussie slipped yesterday to its lowest level
since June 1.  The currency’s decline since April 1 tops the 6.6 percent
drop by the yen and 3.7 percent slide by South Africa’s rand.
The Danish krone and the 17-nation euro have added 0.8 percent
to pace gainers.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
