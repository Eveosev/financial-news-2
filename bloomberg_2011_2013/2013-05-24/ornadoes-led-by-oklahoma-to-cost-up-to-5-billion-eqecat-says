Tornadoes that struck the U.S. from
May 18 to May 20, including one that devastated a suburb of
 Oklahoma  City, probably cost insurers between $2 billion and $5
billion, according to catastrophe risk modeler Eqecat.  During the three-day period, 76 tornadoes touched down in
states including  Kansas ,  Nebraska , Missouri, Iowa and Illinois,
the modeler said late yesterday in a  statement , citing National
Weather Service data.  A tornado with winds more than 200 miles (322 kilometers)
per hour leveled homes and killed at least 24 people in Moore,
Oklahoma, a town of about 55,000, on May 20. Insurers including
Allstate Corp. and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.
have dispatched staff to the area to help customers file claims.  “The tornadoes over the period 18-20 May have damaged
thousands of buildings, many of them completely destroyed,”
Eqecat said in the statement. “The Moore, Oklahoma. tornado
alone has caused damage to approximately 13,000 structures and
is where the bulk of the losses are expected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
