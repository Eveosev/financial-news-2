Crude oil options volatility fell for
a second day as the underlying futures were little changed.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 20.2 percent at 2:35 p.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, down from 21.7 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery slipped 10
cents to settle at $94.15 a barrel on the Nymex. Futures dropped
$1.87 this week, the biggest weekly decline since April 19.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
July $100 calls, which slid 11 cents to 19 cents a barrel on
volume of 4,864 contracts at 2:40 p.m. in New York. July $85
puts were the second-most active, declining 5 cents to 18 cents
on 3,296 lots.  Puts accounted for 54 percent of electronic trading volume
today and made up 57 percent of the prior trading dayâ€™s volume
of 163,604 contracts.  July $90 puts were the most-active options traded in the
previous session, with 10,712 contracts changing hands. They
fell 9 cents to 82 cents a barrel. September $85 puts rose 8
cents to $1.36 a barrel on 7,100 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
38,324 contracts. Next were July $90 puts with 37,503 lots and
July $110 calls with 35,329.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
