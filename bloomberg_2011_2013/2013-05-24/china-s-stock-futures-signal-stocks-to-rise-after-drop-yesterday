China’s stocks  rose, lifting the
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  from its biggest slump in a month, as
gains by health-care and technology  stocks  overshadowed losses
among property developers.  Sanan Optoelectronics Co. climbed to a two-year high,
leading technology companies to the biggest gains among the CSI
300 Index’s industry groups.  Yunnan Baiyao Group Co. (000538)  added 3.9
percent.  China CNR Corp. (601299)  and CSR Corp. gained at least 1.7
percent after the China Securities Journal said China Railway
Corp. may buy locomotives from the two companies. China Vanke
Co., the nation’s biggest listed property developer, dropped.  The  Shanghai  Composite Index closed 0.6 percent higher at
2,288.53, taking its weekly gain to 0.3 percent. The gauge lost
1.2 percent yesterday, the most since April 23, as a HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics report showed Chinese
manufacturing contracted for the first time in seven months and
as Japan’s stocks tumbled the most since March 2011. The Nikkei
225 Stock Average climbed 0.9 percent today after sliding 7.3
percent yesterday.  “The market is recovering from the bad sentiment caused by
the big slump in Japan,” said  Wang Zheng , Shanghai-based chief
investment officer at Jingxi Investment Management Co., which
manages $120 million. “Money will flow back to technology
small-caps as investors mainly believe their earnings are less
reliant on the economy.”  The CSI 300 Index rose 0.6 percent to 2,597.23. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong
Kong  added 0.2 percent. The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index, the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, fell
1.3 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Industrial Profits  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 9.9 percent
above the 30-day average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Thirty-day  volatility  was at 16.3, compared with this year’s
average of 19.5, the data showed.  The index has rebounded 5.2 percent from this year’s low
set on May 2. It trades at 9.3 times 12-month estimated
earnings, compared with a seven-year average of 15.7 times,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  The statistics bureau is scheduled to release data on
industrial companies’ profits on May 27. A preliminary reading
of a HSBC and Markit’s Purchasing Managers Index released
yesterday was 49.6, below the 50 level that divides expansion
and contraction.  A gauge of technology stocks in the CSI 300 added 2.6
percent today, the most among the 10 industry groups. Sanan
Optoelectronics jumped 10 percent to 20.78  yuan , the highest
close since March 2011.  Yonyou Software Co. (600588)  rose 4.2 percent to
10.94 yuan.  Developers Retreat  The CSI 300’s health-care sub-index gained 1.4 percent.

cement maker, slid 1.2 percent to 17.11 yuan.  Premier  Li Keqiang  rejected a $6.5 trillion urbanization
proposal drafted by the National Development and Reform
Commission as he sought changes “to put more emphasis on
economic reform,” Reuters reported yesterday. The NDRC is
working with other departments on a draft urbanization plan, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported today.  Rail Stocks  “If the news is true, it shows the government’s tough
attitude toward the real-estate industry as it slows the pace of
construction,” said Dai Fang, a property analyst at Zheshang
Securities Co. in Shanghai, by phone today.  CSR, China’s biggest train maker, rose 1.7 percent to 4.30
yuan. CNR, the second largest, added 2.3 percent to 4.55 yuan.  China Railway Corp. has expressed an intention to buy
locomotives from the two companies, the China Securities Journal
reported today, without saying where it got the information. CNR
may win orders for 100 locomotives and 40 bullet trains, it
said.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., lost 1 percent in New York
yesterday to the lowest level since April 26. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.3 percent.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Darren Boey, Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
