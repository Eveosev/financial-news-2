The majority of the planet’s
predicted 9 billion people faces “severe” pressure for water
within two generations, according to a declaration today by 500
scientists.  “Millions of individual local human actions add up and
reverberate into larger regional, continental and global changes
that have drastically changed water flows and storage,” the
researchers said, in a statement e-mailed by the Global Water
System Project, based at the University of Bonn in  Germany .
“Mismanagement, overuse and  climate change  pose long-term
threats to human well-being.”  The  United Nations  estimates that about 1.2 billion people
already face water scarcity, with another 500 million
approaching that level. Another 1.6 billion people live in
nations that lack the necessary infrastructure to extract water
from aquifers and reservoirs, the global body says. That’s set
to get worse, according to today’s declaration.  The researchers called on governments to step up research
into water management, train “the next generation” of water
scientists and stimulate innovation in developing technology to
better use water.  To contact the reporter on this story:
