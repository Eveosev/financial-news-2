Cattle futures rose, capping the
first weekly gain in a month, on speculation that U.S. beef
demand will climb as more people grill outdoors. Hog prices also
climbed.  Wholesale beef headed for the sixth straight weekly gain,
the longest rally since May 2010, U.S. Department of Agriculture
data show. Meatpackers will process an estimated 648,000 head of
cattle this week, up 1.3 percent from a year earlier, government
figures show.  “We’re looking forward to summer and the grilling
season,” Lawrence Kane, a market adviser at Stewart-Peterson
Group in  Yates City ,  Illinois , said in a telephone interview.
“Cattle have been drifting lower, but we have some sensation of
a bottom right in here.”  Cattle futures for August delivery rose 0.9 percent to
close at $1.19225 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. This week, the price climbed 0.6 percent.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement climbed 1.3
percent to $1.4455 a pound.  Hog futures for July settlement advanced 0.3 percent to
93.3 cents a pound. This week, the price climbed 2.6 percent,
the most this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
