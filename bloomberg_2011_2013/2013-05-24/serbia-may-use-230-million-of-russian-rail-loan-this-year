Serbia ’s state rail company plans to
use more than a quarter of a $800 million Russian infrastructure
loan this year as it rebuilds tracks and renews rolling stock in
its first major upgrade in decades.  Reconstruction of three sections along the Balkan nation’s
main north-south route, an upgrade of rail link between Belgrade
and the industrial city of Pancevo and purchase of 27 diesel
trains from  Russia ’s Metrovagonmash OAO, are projects worth a
combined $230 million that Belgrade-based Zeleznice Srbije will
start implementing in 2013, Chief Executive Officer Dragoljub
Simonovic said after signing a contract with OAO Russian
Railways, or RZD, in Belgrade yesterday.  “These are the priorities out of the five projects
agreed” that include a 250 million-euro ($323 million) repair
of tracks between Belgrade and neighboring Montenegro and a 300
million-euro upgrade of Novi Sad-Stara Pazova railroad in
northern Serbia, Simonovic said.  The infrastructure loan is part of a $1 billion Russian
support to Serbia agreed to in 2009. It comes with 4.1 percent
interest rate and the tranches will be drawn through 2017, each
with a four-year grace period and repayment over 10 years.  Russian companies, including units of Russian Railways,
will serve as contractors while Serb companies will work as
subcontractors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
