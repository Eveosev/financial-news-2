Kmart, the Australian discount
department-store unit of  Wesfarmers Ltd. (WES) , said it ceased
production earlier this month at a Bangladesh clothing factory
and evacuated workers after the plant was designated unsafe.  Employees of the Ratul Fabrics Ltd. factory in Dhaka were
asked to leave the premises within 70 minutes of the company
being informed of the results of an inspection by industrial
police, Tracie Walker, general manager of Kmart Corporate
Affairs and Sustainability, said in an e-mail today.  A civil engineer sent in by Ratul Fabrics found that cracks
in the building walls were non-structural, Walker said. Checks
made for Kmart by Intertek Group Plc had the same findings,
while two separate reports based on inspections by engineers
found that the factory is safe and production has resumed, she
also said.  Ratul Fabrics was informed earlier this year that Kmart
wouldn’t place any further orders with the company because of
its location above a market place, Walker said. The supplier is
finishing up its final order for Kmart, she said by phone.  Kmart’s response follows a Bloomberg News report that a
government inspection found cracks in the walls of the Ratul
Fabrics building, along with potential fire hazards.  More than 1,100 people were killed a month ago when the
Rana Plaza factory building in Dhaka collapsed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
