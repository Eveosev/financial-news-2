Energy rigs in the U.S. fell by seven
this week to 1,762, according to  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Oil rigs  fell by six to 1,402, data posted on Baker Hughes’
website show. Natural gas rigs were unchanged at 354, the
Houston-based field-services company said. Miscellaneous rigs
declined by one to six.  The total U.S. rig count, which has risen 14 in the second
quarter after declining 15 in the first quarter, “beginning to
creep up again after remaining dormant in the first quarter,”
Peter A. Ragauss, Baker Hughes’ chief financial officer, said at
the UBS Global Oil & Gas Conference in Austin,  Texas , May 22.
“ Oil prices  remain favorable, and U.S. natural gas has been a
little better than many would have predicted a few months ago.”  Higher energy prices are driving Baker Hughes’ customers to
boost drilling activity “in virtually every oil and gas basin
around the world,” Ragauss said.  Natural gas for June delivery fell 2.2 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $4.239 per million British thermal units on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange at 1:11 p.m. New York time, up 60
percent from a year ago.  U.S.  gas stockpiles  gained 89 billion cubic feet to 2.053
trillion in the week ended May 17, below the five-year average
injection of 90 billion, the Energy Information Administration,
the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said yesterday.  Oil Output  U.S.  oil output  slipped a second week, dropping 0.9 percent
to 7.26 million barrels a day last week, EIA data show.
Stockpiles also fell a second week, losing 0.1 percent to 394.6
million barrels. Supplies reached the highest level in more than
82 years on May 3.  Crude for July delivery dropped 26 cents to $93.99 a barrel
today on the Nymex. Prices have gained 3.7 percent in the past
year.  Oil futures have traded as much as 24 times higher than gas
futures this month, compared with a 10-year average of 15 times,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  The percentage of rigs targeting oil in Texas’s Eagle Ford
shale play has grown to 87 percent, up from 66 percent a year
ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The total rig
count there is down 10 percent from a year earlier, “likely due
to a focus on pad drilling,” Christian O’Neill, a Bloomberg
Industries analyst in Skillman,  New Jersey , said in a research
note yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
