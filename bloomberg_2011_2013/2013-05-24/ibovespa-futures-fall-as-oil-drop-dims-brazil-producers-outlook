The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  headed for a second
weekly gain as Brazilian homebuilders advanced, outweighing a
drop in raw-materials companies.  MRV Engenharia e Participacoes SA  rose the most on the
BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index.  Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the worldâ€™s
largest pulp producer, gained as the company said it will sell
assets to pay down debt. Iron-ore producer Vale SA tumbled for a
third day, following metals lower.  The Ibovespa was little changed at 56,314.29 at 4:33 p.m.
in  Sao Paulo . It has gained 2.1 percent this week. Thirty-five
stocks dropped on the benchmark today while 36 rose. The real
weakened 0.2 percent to 2.0479 per dollar.  MRV advanced 4.7 percent to 7.73 reais. Fibria gained 2
percent to 22.52 reais. Vale lost 0.7 percent to 30.18 reais.  To contact the reporters on this story:
