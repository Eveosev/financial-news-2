Schools in Newtown,  Connecticut ,
are getting more than $1.3 million in U.S. government aid for
counseling services as the community recovers from shootings
five months ago at Sandy Hook Elementary that killed 26 people.  The grant will support school district leaders as they
continue to restore “a safe and healthy environment that is
critical to teaching and learning,” the U.S. Education
Department said today in a  statement .  The Department provides funding for school districts and
colleges that have experienced a significant traumatic event.
Twenty first-graders and six educators died in the Dec. 14
massacre, the second-deadliest shooting in the U.S. Gunman Adam
Lanza killed his mother at her home before entering the school,
where he also shot himself dead.  The grant will help provide support groups, creative
expression and wellness activities as well as counseling and
training for educators, school personnel and additional support
staff, the Education Department said.  “This tragedy has forever changed the entire Newtown
community -- and our country,” Education Secretary  Arne Duncan 
said in the statement. “We want to do whatever we can to
support ongoing recovery efforts and ensure this community has
the resources it needs to meet the needs of its teachers,
students and families.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
