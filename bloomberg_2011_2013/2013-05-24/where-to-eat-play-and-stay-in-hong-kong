Hong Kong has plenty of superlative hotels, amazing food, and cool shopping. That's why we've narrowed down a few picks from our editor at large, Hanya Yanagihara—to make it easier for you. Where to Stay The Splurge:  Goodness knows, Hong Kong abounds with superlative hotels, and the service at all of them—brisk without being brusque, and attentive without being cloying—is some of the best you'll find anywhere. But for a place with decor that's as subtle as the service, head to the  Upper House , which occupies the top floors of a tower in the Admiralty District, with sweeping views of the bay. The clay- and earth-tone rooms (and enormous, dramatically lit bathrooms) are an oasis in this frenetic city (852-2918-1838; doubles from $581). Another good bet is The Langham, in the posh Tsimshatsui area. The rooms are bright and airy, and the lobby—with acres of marble—is appropriately grand (852-2375-1133; doubles from $426). The Steal:  It's strictly self-conscious stylish at the 56-room Philippe Starck–designed  J Plus Boutique Hotel , in the bustling, jam-packed Causeway Bay District. You either love the white-on-white aesthetic or you don't, and the rooms are snug, but it's a good deal in this pricey city (852-3196-9000; doubles from $245). What to Do Explore the Sheung Wan District:  One of the earliest British-settled areas, Sheung Wan, in the northwest of Hong Kong Island, is one of the city's most bustling spots…as well as its most evocative and picturesque. Here you'll find dozens of little low-slung shops selling incense, souvenirs, and genuine antiques. Despite the skyscrapers that loom around you, you'll find certain corners where you can close your eyes—and find yourself yanked back to the early twentieth century. Shop:  Paris has Le Bon Marché. New York has Barneys. Tokyo has Isetan. And Hong Kong? Well, Hong Kong has  Lane Crawford , the ultimate in chic designer clothes, accessories, housewares, and beauty products. Even if you're not in the market for a statement necklace, you won't be able to resist gazing at the local PYTs who trot, gazelle-like, through this glittery department store (IFC Mall, Level 3, 8 Finance St., Central). And if a $5,000 exotic-skin handbag isn't your idea of a fun souvenir, head over to G.O.D. (Goods of Desire), a cheerful, eclectic emporium of affordable (but just as covetable) largely made-in-Hong-Kong goods, from paper fans to blazing-neon qipaos (48 Hollywood Rd., Central). Take a Ferry Ride:  There's nothing like a ride on the  Star Ferry  to prove that despite all the changes, all the development, all the evidence of shiny modernity, you're still in one of the world's most storied and lovely port cities. In the late nineteenth century, ferries were an essential mode of transportation: Indeed, until 1972, they were the only means of passage between the Kowloon Peninsula and the island of Hong Kong. A century later, they provide a nostalgia trip—and more than their share of picturesque vistas (Star Ferry Pier; 852-2367-7065). Where to Eat Our Top Three:  Well, here's the tricky part: Ask five Hong Kongers where to eat and you'll probably get enough answers to last you a month. But assuming you (sadly) don't have a month, you could do far worse than beginning your eating adventure with ha gow shrimp dumplings at the fancy dim sum emporium  Cuisine Cuisine  (IFC Mall, Level 3, 8 Finance St., Central; 852-2393-3933; entrées from $7), followed by stops at Joy Hing for all things barbecue (265–267 Hennessy Rd., Wan Chai; 852-2519-6639; entrées from $3), and  Condé Nast Traveler  2012 Hot Table pick  Yardbird  for, you guessed it, chicken in all its various glories (33–35 Bridges St., Sheung Wan; 852-2547-9273; entrées from $5).
