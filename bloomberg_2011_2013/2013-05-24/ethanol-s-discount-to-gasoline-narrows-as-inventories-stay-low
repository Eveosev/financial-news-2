Ethanol tumbled the most in more than
a week against gasoline on speculation that favorable weather
has helped farmers sow corn crops, reducing production costs to
make the biofuel.  The spread, or price difference, increased 3.39 cents to
23.5 cents a gallon, the widest since May 15, on expectations
farmers boosted planting from the 71 percent as of May 19
because of drier weather. They plan to sow the biggest crop
since 1936, the Agriculture Department  forecasts . One bushel of
the grain makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  “If we get a big crop, that will certainly impact
things,” said Will Babler, a broker at Atten Babler Risk
Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois . “It shows there’s good
demand out there.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery fell 2.3 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.604 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 26 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for June delivery rose 1.09 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $2.839 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol  production  gained 2.1 percent to 875,000 barrels a
day last week, up 11 percent from a record low of 770,000
barrels a day in January, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration.  More Corn  Farmers are planting more corn as they seek to rebound from
last summer’s drought that wilted crops and pushed prices for
the grain to a record in August.  Corn for July delivery decreased 4.75 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $6.5725 a bushel in  Chicago .  The corn crush spread for July was 8 cents, unchanged from
yesterday, compared with minus 35 cents on Dec. 31. The amount
doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’
grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to
livestock.  Returns have been at or above break-even for the longest
stretch since December 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A 2007 energy law mandates that the U.S. use 13.8 billion
gallons of ethanol this year. Compliance is tracked by Renewable
Identification Numbers, certificates attached to each gallon of
biofuel that are submitted to the government and that can be
traded between refiners.  Corn-based ethanol RINs for 2013  were unchanged at 85.5
cents, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs, which
cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, declined
2 cents to 95 cents.  Low Stockpiles  Lower production rates this year have translated into
record-low season stockpiles. Inventories last week decreased
1.5 percent to 16.2 million barrels, the lowest since November
2010, the EIA report showed.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 94 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline supply, down from 95 percent the previous
week and the smallest amount since April 19, EIA data show.  Babler said a late harvest in Brazil, where sugarcane is
used to make ethanol, helped to make it less competitive for
export to the U.S.  The country hasn’t  imported  any ethanol since April 19, EIA
data show, the longest streak since March 2012.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.53 a gallon last
week, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol surged 4.5 cents to $2.815
a gallon on the West Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
additive lost 2 cents to $2.72 in  New York  Harbor, 2 cents to
$2.62 in Chicago and 1 cent to $2.74 on the  Gulf Coast .  New York Harbor’s premium to Chicago was unchanged at 10
cents, while the Gulf Coast’s discount to the West Coast swelled
5.5 cents to 7.5 cents, the widest since May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
