Bankia SA (BKIA) , a Spanish lender rescued
last year with funds from Europe, agreed to sell its bank in
Florida to Chile’s  Banco de Credito e Inversiones (BCI)  for $882.8
million.  The sale of City National Bank of Florida will yield a net
gain of 180 million euros ($233 million) and add 30 basis points
to core capital, Valencia-based Bankia said in a filing to
regulators today.  The terms of a 22 billion-euro bailout for Bankia oblige
Chairman Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri to find buyers for non-core
assets such as the Miami-based bank and holdings including a
 stake  in insurer  Mapfre SA. (MAP)  City National had $4.7 billion of
assets, 26 branches and 435 employees at the end of March,
Bankia said.  BCI fell 4.7 percent today in Santiago, its biggest drop
since September 2011. The bank, owned by the billionaire Yarur
family, plans to pay for the acquisition by selling new stock
and bonds, it said in a statement.  BCI’s acquisition is the second foray out of Chile by a
local bank after  Corpbanca SA (CORPBANC) , controlled by Billionaire Alvaro Saieh, 63, acquired Banco Santander SA’s operations in Colombia
for $1.16 billion in December 2011. Corpbanca later agreed to
pay $1.28 billion for Colombia’s Helm Bank SA to expand its
presence in the country.  Bankia joins other Spanish lenders that have sold assets in
the Americas to bolster capital.  CaixaBank SA (CABK)  said yesterday it may sell a 10 percent stake
in Grupo Financiero Inbursa SAB, a Mexican financial services
firm owned by 73-year-old billionaire  Carlos Slim . Banco
Santander sold a stake last year in Grupo Financiero Santander
Mexico, adding to disposals of other Latin American assets
including its Colombian bank.  Caja Madrid, the lender that led a seven-way merger of
savings banks in 2010 to form Bankia, acquired City National in
April 2008, paying $927 million for an 83 percent stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
