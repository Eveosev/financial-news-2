Italian prosecutors ordered the
seizure of 8.1 billion euros ($10.5 billion) of assets belonging
to the Riva family, one of Europe’s wealthiest industrial
families and owners of Ilva, Europe’s largest steel plant.  Spokesmen for Ilva in Taranto,  Italy , and Italian financial
police in Rome said a seizure order was issued, though they
declined to give additional details.  Emilio Riva, the chairman of closely held Gruppo Riva SpA,
which controls Ilva, is facing accusations of causing an
“environmental disaster” at the Ilva plant in Taranto,
according to court documents. The company has said it’s fighting
the charges.  Separately, Italian financial police on May 22 ordered the
seizure of eight trust funds for a total of 1.2 billion euros
linked to a “famous Italian family” operating in the steelmaking
industry, according to an e-mailed statement from the police.
Authorities didn’t identify the family. Investigators are
probing four individuals for alleged money laundering and tax
fraud through Channel Islands trusts, according to the May 22
statement.  A spokesman for the Riva family couldn’t immediately be
reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
