Brazil’s swap rates climbed as
evidence the  U.S. economy  is rebounding fueled speculation that
local policy makers will step up increases in borrowing costs to
curb inflation.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 rose four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.59 percent at 10:15
a.m. in  Sao Paulo , extending their increase this week to seven
basis points. The real depreciated 0.2 percent to 2.0472 per
dollar and was down 0.6 percent since May 17 in a fourth weekly
decline, the longest losing streak since October.  Brazil’s central bank raised the  target lending rate  last
month by a quarter-percentage point to 7.50 percent to curb
inflation. Policy makers had lowered borrowing costs by 5.25
percentage points in reductions that began in August 2011 to
support economic growth.  “External uncertainties” require that  Brazil ’s monetary
policy “be managed with caution,” the central bank said in a
statement accompanying its decision. The board’s next rate-setting meeting is May 28-29.  Orders for U.S. durable goods increased more than forecast
in April, the Commerce Department reported in  Washington  today,
pointing to gains in business investment that will help
manufacturing rebound in the second half of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
