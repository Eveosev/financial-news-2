InterOil Corp. (IOC) , the Australian energy
company with licenses to explore about 3.9 million acres, said
it entered exclusive talks with Exxon Mobil Corp. to develop
natural gas fields in  Papua New Guinea .  Included in the talks is the potential sale of a stake in
Petroleum Retention License 15, which comprises the Elk and
Antelope fields, that is sufficient to supply gas to develop an
additional liquefied natural gas train, Cairns-based InterOil
said in a statement today.  InterOil and Pacific LNG Group, its joint-venture partner,
may also get funding for more wells in the fields. The fields
hold an estimated 9 trillion cubic feet of recoverable sales
gas, InterOil said in its 2012  annual report . The company had
spent $384 million on the fields through March 31.  The announcement was made before the start of regular
trading in New York. InterOil  rose  9.1 percent to $102 at 7:34
