Taiwan dollar  forwards completed
their biggest weekly gain in a month as a plan to cut taxes on
stock investments attracted global funds to the island’s assets.
Bonds fell.  Overseas funds bought $107 million more local shares than
they sold in the week through yesterday, taking inflows this
year to $4.9 billion, according to exchange data. The Taiex
index of shares touched a 21-month high on May 22. Political
parties now need to reach a consensus on the tax-reduction
proposal before the bill’s second reading in parliament.  “Hot money is coming in,” said Tarsicio Tong, a currency
trader at Union Bank of Taiwan in Taipei. “Foreign investors
are interested in buying Taiwanese stocks because of the tax
plan offering better prospects. I understand that the central
bank wants to see stable foreign-exchange rates.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the Taiwan dollar
advanced 0.6 percent against the greenback this week, the most
since the week ended April 26, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts rose 0.3 percent today to NT$29.900.  The Taiwan dollar was little changed today and rose 0.1
percent this week to NT$30.03, show prices from Taipei Forex
Inc. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell 14 basis
points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 4.98 percent.  If the bill is approved, the  tax rate  for investors with
trading volumes of NT$1 billion ($33.4 million) or more will be
lowered to 0.1 percent from 2.25 percent, while those with less
than NT$1 billion will be exempt from any levy.  The yield on the 1.125 percent government bonds due March
2023 rose four basis points this week to 1.294 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market. It was down one basis
point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
