Swiss stocks  were little changed,
following their biggest drop in 20 months yesterday, as
speculation central banks will reduce stimulus offset Moody’s
Investors Service’s confirmation of Switzerland’s credit rating.  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  climbed 1 percent after the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration approved the drugmaker’s test to diagnose
diabetes.  Syngenta AG (SYNN)  added 1.4 percent.  Novartis AG (NOVN)  was the
biggest drag on the Swiss Market Index.  The benchmark SMI was unchanged at 8,168.78 at the close of
trading in Zurich, after climbing as much as 0.8 percent and
dropping as much as 0.4 percent. The gauge has fallen 1.4
percent this week. It tumbled 2.8 percent yesterday, the biggest
plunge since September 2011, amid concern the Federal Reserve
will scale back its bond purchases and as a report showed
Chinese manufacturing contracted this month. The equity
benchmark has still  rallied 20 percent  in 2013. The broader
Swiss Performance Index was also little changed today.  “The  SMI (SMI)  is performing better than other European indexes
as investors may still be searching for the yield offered by
Swiss companies,” said Peter Stenz, a Zurich-based portfolio
manager at Swisscanto Asset Management AG, which oversees about
$57 billion. “The SMI reached a new year high on May 22, driven
by defensive and relatively high-yield stocks such as Roche,
Givaudan, Swiss Re and Novartis. Not surprisingly, these so far
best-performing stocks suffered the most yesterday.”  Germany’s DAX Index and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index slid 0.6
percent.  France ’s CAC 40 Index lost 0.3 percent.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 4.3 percent less than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Credit Rating  Moody’s reiterated Switzerland’s Aaa rating yesterday,
saying the country has a stable outlook because of its economic
strength and proven resilience.  In  Germany , the Ifo institute’s  business-climate index ,
based on a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 105.7 in May,
its first gain in three months. Economists had predicted the
measure would be unchanged from its 104.4 level in April,
according to the  median of 44 forecasts  in a Bloomberg survey.  In the U.S., a Commerce Department report showed that
orders for  durable goods  climbed 3.3 percent in April,
rebounding from a decline of 5.9 percent in March. That beat the
1.5 percent median estimate of economists.  Roche rose 1 percent to 253.10 francs. The world’s largest
maker of cancer drugs received approval from the  FDA  for its
Cobas Integra 800 diabetes test.  Syngenta, the biggest maker of crop chemicals, advanced 1.4
percent to 387.20 francs, halting five days of losses.  Lindt & Spruengli AG (LISN) , which makes the Lindt chocolate
bunny, added 2.7 percent to 40,850 francs.  Novartis dropped 0.3 percent to 71.25 Swiss francs as
Europe’s biggest drugmaker fell for a second day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
