Samruk- Energy JSC (ENRG) , a power company in
 Kazakhstan , won a 14.2 billion-tenge ($94 million) loan from the
Eurasian Development Bank to build the nation’s first large-scale wind farm.  Construction of the $118 million plant in the Akmola
province in north-central Kazakhstan will start in July, with
first output due in December next year, Yulia Ostroukhova, a
spokeswoman for the Almaty-based bank, said today in an e-mail.  Kazakhstan has adopted a clean-power plan aimed at driving
an increase in wind-energy output before it hosts the EXPO 2017
world fair. The government seeks to expand renewable generating
capacity to 1,040 megawatts by the end of the decade from 110
megawatts last year, according to a February announcement.  Samruk-Energy’s 45-megawatt facility will use 22 turbines
made by Fuhrlaender AG of  Germany , Ostroukhova said. The EDB’s
loan has a 10-year maturity, according to the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
