Russia , the world’s largest energy
exporter, plans to ship less than one million barrels a day of
Urals crude from Primorsk port on the  Baltic Sea  for the first
time since at least 2008, a preliminary loading program showed.  Primorsk will export 39 cargoes in June totalling 3.9
million metric tons, or 953,000 barrels a day, down 16 percent
from this month, the schedule obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.
The port has  loaded  more than a million barrels a day every
month since at least March 2008, when Bloomberg began tracking
the data.  Russia’s available refining capacity in June is forecast to
be at the highest level of the year to date, reducing the amount
of crude available for export, according to a weekly report sent
May 23 by the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK.  Ust-Luga, also on the Baltic, will ship 19 cargoes of
100,000 tons each, according to the program. That amounts to
464,000 barrels a day, 6.5 percent less than planned this month.  Primorsk has three unassigned slots of 100,000 tons each
and Ust-Luga has two 100,000-ton positions available, according
to the program.  Exports from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  will be 3.15
million tons next month, or about 770,000 barrels a day, up 0.3
percent from May. The June schedule includes one 80,000-ton
cargo of Siberian Light grade and 29 Urals cargoes.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
