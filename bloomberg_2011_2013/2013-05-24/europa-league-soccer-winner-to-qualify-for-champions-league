(Corrects score in final paragraph of story published
yesterday.)  The winner of soccer’s Europa League
will qualify for the following season’s  Champions League ,
beginning with the 2015-16 season.  European soccer governing body UEFA made the  announcement 
today at its annual Congress in London, site of tomorrow’s all-German Champions League final between  Bayern Munich  and  Borussia
Dortmund . The move is being made to broaden the appeal of
Europe’s second-tier club competition.  “As was proven with this year’s magnificent final, the
UEFA Europa League has gone from strength to strength, but we
wanted to give clubs a further incentive, so that all of them
play with a desire to win the competition,” UEFA President
 Michel Platini  said. “By guaranteeing access to the UEFA
Champions League for the winners, we are convinced that the UEFA
Europa League will increase its appeal for clubs and their
supporters.”  The Europa League winner will enter the playoff round of
the Champions League. As a result, the maximum number of
qualifying teams from one country increases to five from four.  “I am convinced that these new changes will help to
further boost the UEFA Europa League,” Karl-Heinz Rummenigge,
chairman of the European Club Association, a group of the
continent’s top clubs, said in a statement. “The Europa League
is a very good competition and will continue to develop and grow
in the future.”  England’s Chelsea won the Europa League title May 15 by
beating Benfica of Portugal 2-1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
