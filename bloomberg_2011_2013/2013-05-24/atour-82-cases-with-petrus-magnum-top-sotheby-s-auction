Five cases of Chateau Latour 1982
from  Bordeaux ’s Pauillac region fetched 12,925 pounds ($19,540)
each to lead bids at a Sotheby’s wine sale in London this week
as a double magnum of Chateau Petrus 1982 sold for 9,988 pounds.  While Bordeaux took the top slots at the sale, Burgundies
included single bottles of Romanee-Conti Domaine de la Romanee-Conti from 2005 and 2009 selling for respectively 9,635 pounds
and 9,165 pounds each, according to a Sotheby’s statement.  An 11 percent gain in the four months to mid-March on the
Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has been followed by a 3 percent
decline since then as investors have focused on the pricing of
Bordeaux 2012 wine futures. The broader Liv-ex Fine Wine 100
Index, calculated monthly, has risen 5.9 percent this year.  “There is a dearth of older stock around,” Miles Davis,
partner in London-based Wine Asset Managers LLP, with $20
million under management, said in a phone interview. “The
overall market is trading sideways.”  While brokers have grappled with the pricing of the
Bordeaux 2012 sales campaign since early April, Davis said there 
is underlying demand for vintages from the 1980s and 1990s.  A half-case of La Tache 2006 DRC sold for 7,990 pounds at
 Sotheby’s (BID)  and a single bottle of Romanee-Conti 2008 DRC fetched
7,285 pounds. The auction raised a total 867,000 pounds, with 88
percent of lots sold by volume and 96 percent by value. Prices
included a 17.5 percent buyer’s premium.  At a Hart Davis Hart Wine Co. two-day sale in  Chicago  last
weekend, leading lots included a case of La Tache 1990 DRC which
sold for $59,750, a 12-bottle Domaine de la Romanee-Conti 1978
assortment which fetched $53,775 and a case of Petrus 1990 which
went under the hammer for $45,410. All lots sold, with a buyer’s
premium of 19.5 percent.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
this year, with the total sold. Links are to auction websites or
