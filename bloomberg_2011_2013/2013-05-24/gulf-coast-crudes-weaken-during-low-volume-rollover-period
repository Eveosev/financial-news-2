U.S. Gulf Coast crude oils weakened
on the  spot market  on the last day of the rollover period,
characterized by below-normal volume and erratic pricing.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to benchmark West Texas
Intermediate weakened by $1 to $8.25 a barrel as of 12:03 p.m.
 New York  time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Spot WTI for delivery at Cushing, Oklahoma, slid 1 cent to
30 cents below July WTI futures on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. June futures expired May 21.  Today is the last of three days that physical-market
traders have to close their books for the trading month.  The premiums of other Gulf coast oils also shrank. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet lost $1.30 against WTI to $7.30, while Mars
Blend slid 30 cents to $3.20.  Thunder Horse  weakened by 15 cents
to $5.85 and Poseidon slipped 10 cents to $3.20.  In Canada, heavy  oil prices  strengthened in out-of-index
trading. Western Canada Select, a heavy oil blend of oil-sands
bitumen, gained 25 cents, narrowing its discount to WTI to
$19.75 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Most of the trading volume for June Canadian crude
shipments occurred during index trading from May 1 to May 16,
when the average price for next month’s delivery was set.  To contact the reporter on this story:
