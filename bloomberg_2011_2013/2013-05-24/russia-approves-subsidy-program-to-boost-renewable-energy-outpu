Russia approved an incentive program
to boost renewable-energy production, targeting almost 6
gigawatts of new capacity by 2020 and its first solar parks.  The government yesterday signed a decree that includes
measures to support wind, photovoltaic and small hydropower
projects across the country, Dmitry Babanskiy, a spokesman for
the Energy Ministry, said today by e-mail.  The measures will increase the proportion of renewable
energy to 2.5 percent of power generation by 2020 from 0.8
percent now, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
