Steel reinforcement-bar futures pared
a weekly loss as a rebound in  China ’s stock market from the
biggest slump in a month countered weaker demand prospects.  Rebar for delivery in October rose as much as 0.9 percent
to 3,584 yuan ($585) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange and was at 3,565 at 10:55 a.m. Futures lost 1.6 percent
this week, a second weekly decline.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  gained as much as 0.7 percent
today after dropping 1.2 percent to 2,275.67 yesterday, as a
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics report showed Chinese
manufacturing contracted for the first time in seven months.  “The rebar market is correlated to the broader Chinese
equity market these days,” Wu Jingchen, an analyst at Capital
Futures Co., said by phone from Beijing today. “Rebar
fundamentals still point to the downside amid expectations for
slower economic growth in China.”  Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to Tianjin port
was unchanged at $123.20 a dry ton yesterday, according to The
Steel Index Ltd. data. The average  spot price  for rebar was
little changed at 3,548  yuan  a ton yesterday, according to data
from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
