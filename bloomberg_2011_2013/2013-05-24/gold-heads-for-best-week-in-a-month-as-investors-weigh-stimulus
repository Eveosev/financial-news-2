Gold fell for the third time in four
days as signs of a rebounding U.S. economy revived concern that
the  Federal Reserve  will scale back monetary stimulus, eroding
the appeal of the precious metal as a store of value.  Orders for durable goods  increased  more than forecast in
April by 3.3 percent, the Commerce Department said today.
Economists in a Bloomberg survey expected a 1.5 percent
increase. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said May 22 that the
central bank may slow the $85 billion a month of Treasury and
mortgage debt purchases if the economy shows sustained signs of
improvement. Gold has declined 17 percent this year.  “Today’s data is good and another reason for the Fed to
think about ending the stimulus,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer
at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview.  Gold futures for June delivery fell 0.4 percent to settle
at $1,386.60 an ounce at 1:35 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Prices are down 5.8 percent in May, heading for a second
straight decline.  Gold tumbled into a  bear market  in April as some investors
lost faith in the metal as a store of value and amid concern
that the Fed may scale back stimulus.  Bank of Japan  Governor
Haruhiko Kuroda said today the central bank had announced
sufficient monetary easing.  Holdings in  exchange-traded products  dropped 3.8 metric tons
to 2,164.8 tons yesterday, the lowest since July 2011, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Silver Declines  Silver futures for July delivery lost 0.1 percent to
$22.496 an ounce in New York. The precious metal has plunged 26
percent this year, the worst performer in the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI gauge of 24 commodities.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
June delivery retreated 1.7 percent to $726.45 an ounce. Prices

the past 100 days for this time of day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Platinum futures for July delivery slid 0.4 percent to
