The European Insurance and
Occupational Pensions Authority, the European Union’s insurance
watchdog, called for extending its powers to include directly
banning and restricting financial activities to enhance its
supervision.  Eiopa, which is charged with drafting new solvency rules
for European insurers, also wants to “explore partial financing
by levying fees” on the insurance companies it regulates,
according to a speech by Chairman Gabriel Bernardino, who is
attending a public hearing on financial supervision in Brussels
today.  The authority, which is one of the three European
supervisory bodies for the financial industry, is currently
funded by the European Union, which directly pays 40 percent of
its budget, while the remaining 60 percent is paid by the  member
states .  Eiopa wants more flexibility in its financing and says
exploring a levy as well as getting financing through an
independent budget line in the EU’s general budget are steps
“necessary in order to strengthen the operational independence
of Eiopa” and to attract qualified staff, according to the
speech.  Bernardino also wants direct access to information of
individual insurers and to be able to directly conduct inquiries
into financial institutions, products, or behavior. It currently
has to go through local supervisors.  “This power should not be confined to situations of
potential threats to the stability of the financial system but
be used more generally to support the independent challenging
role of Eiopa,” Bernardino said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
