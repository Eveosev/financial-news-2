Money-market forward indicators
signaled short-term dollar funding conditions held steady as the
rate to borrow Treasuries for one day in the repurchase
agreement market held close to a 17-month low.  The overnight Treasury general collateral repurchase
agreement rate opened today at 0.1 percent, according to ICAP
Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker. The  average rate 
for borrowing and lending Treasuries for one day in the repo
market reached 0.018 percent on May 22, the lowest since
December 30, 2011, when the rate was negative 0.001, according
to a GCF repo index provided on a one-day lag by the Depository
Trust & Clearing Corp. The DTCC index was 0.041 percent
yesterday.  Securities dealers use repos to finance holdings and
increase leverage. Securities that can be borrowed at  interest
rates  close to the Fed’s target rate are called general
collateral. Those in highest demand have lower rates and are
called “special.”  The  average rate  for overnight federal funds, known as the
fed effective rate, slide this month as repo rates declined as a
seasonal build up of cash has triggered the Treasury department
to cut bill issuance, limiting the amount of collateral in the
funding markets. The fed effective was 0.08 percent yesterday,
matching the rate of the prior day and the lowest since
February.  The effective rate is a volume-weighted average of trades
between major brokers for overnight funds, reported on a day lag
by the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York .  Libor Rates  Three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor, held
for a second day  at  0.27275 percent, the lowest since August
2011, according to the British Bankers’ Association. The Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance to lend, was little
changed at 15.9 basis points.  Overnight index swaps, or OIS, give traders predictions on
what the  Federal Reserve ’s effective funds rate will average for
the term of the swap. The central bank’s target rate is set in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent.  Predictions in the forward market for Libor-OIS, known as
the FRA/OIS spread, was 17.9 basis points from 17.8 basis points
yesterday, according to the second rolling three month
contracts.  The difference between the two-year swap rate and the
comparable-maturity Treasury note yield, known as the swap
spread, widened 0.4 basis points to 15.45 basis points. The gap
is a gauge of investors’ perceptions of U.S. banking-sector
credit risk as swap rates are derived from expectations for
dollar Libor.  Swap rates serve as benchmarks for investors in many types
of debt, including mortgage-backed and auto-loan securities.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S.  commercial paper 
rose $19.8 billion to $1.0334 trillion in the week ended May 22,
according to Fed data.  Euribor-OIS Spread  The cost for European banks to convert euro-denominated
payment streams into dollars-based funding via the cross
currency swaps market decreased. The three-month cross-currency
basis swap was 14.2 basis points below Euribor, compared with
14.5 basis points below yesterday.  Foreign-exchange swaps are typically for periods of less
than a year, while cross-currency basis swaps usually range from
one to 30 years. The latter are agreements in which a person
borrows in one currency and simultaneously lends in a different
currency. The trade involves the exchange of two different
floating-rate payments, each denominated in a different currency
and based on a different index.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps held steady.
The measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another was 13
basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
