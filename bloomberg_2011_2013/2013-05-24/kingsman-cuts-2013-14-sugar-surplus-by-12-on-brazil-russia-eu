The global sugar surplus in the
2013-14 season will be 12 percent smaller than initially
estimated as leading producer  Brazil ,  Russia  and the European
Union have smaller-than-forecast crops, said Kingsman SA.  Sugar output will be 4.9 million metric tons higher than
demand in the 12 months starting Oct. 1, down from a previous
forecast of 5.6 million tons, the Lausanne, Switzerland-based
unit of  McGraw-Hill Financial Inc. (MHFI) ’s Platts said in a report e-mailed today. On a national crop year-basis, which begins when
the harvest starts in each country, the surplus was reduced by
27 percent to 4.6 million tons, data from the researcher showed.  Sugar production in Brazil will be 3.1 percent smaller than
the previous estimate at 34.4 million tons as millers there use
more of the raw material to make ethanol, Kingsman said. Output
in the EU will be 16.9 million tons, 600,000 tons less than
previously forecast, it said. In Russia, production will be 5
percent smaller than previously thought at 4.35 million tons.  “The EU is due to the late beet sowings” that resulted
from cold weather this year, Fabienne Pointier, an analyst at
the company, in said by phone from Lausanne today, ahead of the
company’s Asia Pacific Sugar Conference in  Singapore  on May
27-28. “Brazil center south is a decrease due to the ethanol
market that is much more attractive at the moment, but things
could still change.”  Millers in Brazil will direct 45 percent of all the cane
processed this year to making sugar, down from a previous
forecast of 47.5 percent and 49.5 percent a year earlier,
according to the report. The rest will be used for ethanol. The
South American country will harvest a record 585 million tons of
cane, 10 million tons higher than the previous estimate.  “Nearly perfect weather for cane development during the
intercrop season led to an increase in expected agricultural
yields to roughly 80 tons per hectare,” Kingsman said. A
hectare is 2.47 acres.  Global Outlook  Global sugar production will be 177.9 million tons in the
12 months starting in October, the researcher estimates. That
compares with a previous forecast of 178.5 million tons and with
182.2 million tons in 2012-13. Consumption in the period will be
little changed from the earlier estimate at 172.95 million tons.
In 2012-13, demand is forecast at 170.4 million tons.  Millers in  India , the world’s second-biggest grower, will
produce less sugar in 2013-14 as dry weather damages the crop,
according to the report. Output there is forecast at 22.2
million tons next season, unchanged from the previous estimate
and down from 24.8 million tons now.  Drought Impact  “Several districts in Maharashtra are badly affected by two
years of drought and there are reports of entire fields being
completely dried out,” Kingsman said, referring to India’s main
sugar-producing state. “The lack of rain in the last few months
has delayed planting throughout the state and current estimates
suggest that the total cane could be lower by 10 percent to 15
percent compared to 2012-13.”  Sugar production in  Thailand , the second-biggest exporter,
will rise to 10.3 million tons next season compared with 10.2
million tons now, Kingsman said. In  Mexico , output will be 6.2
million tons, up from a previous forecast of 5.3 million tons
and down from this year’s 6.8 million tons.  A reduction in the surplus for 2013-14 will be more than
compensated for by an increase in the current season, according
to Kingsman data. Sugar production in 2012-13 will be 11.8
million tons higher than consumption, 15 percent higher than the
previous forecast, the report showed. On a national crop year-basis, the surplus will be 11.1 million tons from a previous
forecast of 10.3 million tons, according to the researcher.  “With the recent exception of  Europe  and the U.S., growing
and harvesting conditions have been great across the world,”
Kingsman said. “Unless that changes we may have to wait for
2014-15 before the world comes back into balance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
