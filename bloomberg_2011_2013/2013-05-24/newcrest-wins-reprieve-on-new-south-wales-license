Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,  Australia ’s
biggest gold producer, will get another chance to hold on to an
exploration license over 120 square kilometers (30,000 acres)
near its fourth-largest mine, after a ruling by judge.  New South Wales Land and Environment Court Judge Nicola
Pain, after quashing Newcrest’s license renewal in a May 17
ruling, said in her final order this week that the license will
remain in effect until Resources Minister Chris Hartcher
disposes of the renewal application.  “We have not lost our license,” Kerrina Watson, a
Newcrest spokeswoman, said today in an e-mail. “It remains in
our ownership until the reconsideration.”  Newcrest has held an exploration license over the land near
its  Cadia Valley operations , southwest of Orange, since 1991.
The license was renewed for a seventh time on March 14, 2011
with an expiry of May 20, 2014, according to the May 17
judgment. Gold & Copper Pty challenged the renewal on March 16,
2011, claiming it was void or invalid.  Pain upheld Gold & Copper’s objections,  ruling  the state
government failed to provide sufficient reasons for granting the
renewal.  The case is Gold and Copper Resources Pty v Minister for
Resources and Energy. 80736/2011. Land and Environment Court New
South Wales (Sydney).  To contact the reporter on this story:
