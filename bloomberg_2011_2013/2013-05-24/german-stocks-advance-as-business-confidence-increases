German stocks  retreated for a second
day as investors considered this week’s monetary policy
announcements from the U.S. Federal Reserve and carmakers slid.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  fell more
than 1 percent as a gauge of automakers lost the most of the 19
industry groups in the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.  Dialog
Semiconductor Plc (DLG) , which makes chips used in Apple Inc.’s
iPhone, slipped 5.8 percent.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  lost 0.9 percent to 8,273.47 at 4:06 p.m. in
 Frankfurt , heading for a weekly drop of 1.5 percent. The gauge
slid 2.1 percent yesterday, its biggest decline since April 17,
amid concern the U.S. Federal Reserve will reduce its stimulus
measures if the economy improves and as Chinese manufacturing
unexpectedly fell. The HDAX Index retreated 0.8 percent today.  “Yesterday was a typical day -- when there is a hint that
central banks are going to reduce levels of liquidity, markets
take a dive,” Ion-Marc Valahu, co-founder and  fund manager  at
Clairinvest in Geneva, said in a telephone interview. “Today we
have a follow through from that because investors are
questioning the ability and effectiveness of central banks to
pump money into the markets.”  German business confidence increased in May for the first
time in three months. The Ifo institute’s  business climate
index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 105.7
from 104.4 in April. That’s the first gain since February.
Economists predicted sentiment to remain unchanged, according to
the median of 44 forecasts in a  Bloomberg News survey .  Consumer Confidence  Consumer confidence  in Europe’s largest economy will jump
to the highest in more than 5 1/2 years in June as low
unemployment and receding inflation encourage households to
spend, GfK AG said.  The market research company forecast today that its
 consumer-sentiment index , based on a survey of about 2,000
people, will increase to 6.5 next month from 6.2 in May. That
would be the highest since September 2007. Economists expected
the index to remain unchanged, according to the median of 26
estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey .  The German economy grew just 0.1 percent in the first
quarter after a 0.7 percent contraction in the final three
months of 2012 as an unusually long winter damped construction
and investment, according to a report today from the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden.  In the U.S., orders for U.S. durable goods  increased  more
than forecast in April.  Bookings for equipment  meant to last at
least three years increased 3.3 percent last month after
dropping 5.9 percent in March, the Commerce Department said
today in  Washington . The median forecast from 78 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg projected a 1.5 percent increase.  Carmakers Decline  Volkswagen fell 1.3 percent to 165.80 euros. BMW, the
largest maker of luxury cars, dropped 1.7 percent to 70.24
euros. Daimler AG, the third-biggest, lost 1.9 percent to 47.15
euros.  Dialog Semiconductor extended losses, falling 5.8 percent
to 11.53 euros. Shares slid 3.9 percent yesterday after Cirrus
Logic Inc., which provides audio-chips for Apple’s iPhone,
slumped in U.S. trading following a warning on increased pricing
pressure in the smartphone market.  SAP AG slid 3.3 percent to 58.65 euros after saying its
cloud-computing chief and founder of SuccessFactors Inc., a
software provider it bought last year, is leaving the company as
part of a management overhaul.  Lars Dalgaard is stepping down effective June 1 to become
an investor, the world’s largest maker of enterprise-management
software said today.  Siemens AG, Europe’s largest engineering company, rose 1.4
percent to 82.40 euros.  Aleo Solar AG (AS1)  jumped 7 percent to 2.14 euros. The solar-panel maker owned by  Robert Bosch GmbH  has begun talks with
potential buyers. The company said today it is evaluating
“several serious inquiries” for Bosch’s 90.7 percent stake and
aims to find a buyer by the end of the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
