Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) ’s Zambian unit
plans to cut 24 percent of its workforce after costs rose and
the copper price dropped.  Konkola Copper Mines Plc will reduce the total number of
employees at its operations in  Africa ’s biggest producer of the
metal by 2,000 from 8,263, the Chingola, Zambia-based company
said in an e-mailed statement.  Copper for three-month delivery has slumped 8.3 percent to
$7,273 a metric ton over the past 12 months in London trading.
KCM, as the company is known, said labor and electricity, its
two key costs, have been “increasing constantly and
substantially.”  “KCM needs to make business changes to remain economically
viable,” it said. “Regrettably, this means reducing staff
numbers as many of the upgrade and expansion projects come to an
end.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
