A case of Chateau Petrus 2009 Pomerol
carrying an upper estimate of $40,000 is top lot at a Christie’s
International Plc auction in  New York  on May 30-31, along with
Bordeaux first-growth producers and La Tache Burgundy.  A case of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1982 is priced at as
much as $40,000. A 16-bottle lot of wines from the 2000 vintage,
comprising four each of Petrus, Chateau Latour,  Chateau Margaux 
and Chateau Haut-Brion, is estimated to fetch as much as
$30,000, according to Christie’s online catalog.  Investor demand has revived this year after a 17-month
price slide which started in July 2011, boosting the Liv-ex Fine
Wine 50 Index by 8 percent since November. The index fell in
April and early May after posting four straight monthly gains as
merchants focused on the pricing of Bordeaux 2012 futures, known
as en primeur wines. It has still risen 5 percent in 2013.  “The en primeur season ends this week, so I think we’ll
get back to normal,”  Miles Davis , partner in London-based Wine
Asset Managers LLP, with $20 million under management, said in a
phone interview. “If merchants want to make money, they’ll
start to peddle older vintages again.”  A six-bottle lot of La Tache 1990 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Burgundy carries a top estimate of $24,000 while a magnum
of the 1962 vintage from the same vineyard carries the same
price tag. A 12-bottle case of  Chateau Latour  1959 also has the
same upper estimate.  Petrus has figured in auctions earlier this month. A case 
of the 1982 vintage fetched top price at a Christie’s auction 
in London, selling for 35,100 pounds ($54,500) including fees.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
