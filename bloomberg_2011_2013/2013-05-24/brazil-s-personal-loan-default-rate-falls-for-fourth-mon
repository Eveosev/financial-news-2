Brazil ’s consumer-loan default rate
fell for the fourth straight month in April as borrowing costs
declined in a move that may stimulate banks to boost lending.  The consumer default rate fell to 7.5 percent in April from
7.6 percent the month prior, the lowest level since November
2011, the central bank said in a report distributed today in
Brasilia.  “We are starting to see the results of favorable labor
market conditions,”  Jankiel Santos , chief economist at Banco
Espirito Santo de Investimento, said in a telephone interview
from Sao Paulo. “With this decline, banks start to feel more
comfortable giving credit.”  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration has taken steps
including reducing  reserve requirements  and encouraging lending
to fuel consumption after the economy grew at its weakest pace
since 2009 last year. Brazil’s investments have been growing
since the fourth quarter and family consumption remains robust,
central bank President Alexandre Tombini said on May 21.  Policy makers in April increased the benchmark  interest
rate  by a quarter-point from a record low 7.25 percent after
inflation accelerated at the fastest pace in over a year. Swap
rates on the contract maturing in January 2015, the most traded
in  Sao Paulo  today, rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 8.59 percent at 10:47 a.m. local time.  Brazil’s total default rate was unchanged from March at 5.5
percent. The company loan default rate rose to 3.7 percent in
April from 3.6 percent in March.  The average rate on consumer loans decreased to 34.4
percent from 34.5 percent a month earlier, the lowest level so
far this year.  Outstanding credit expanded 1.1 percent in April from March
to 2.45 trillion reais ($1.20 trillion), the central bank said.  Brazil’s $2.5 trillion economy will expand by 2.98 percent
this year, according to the latest central bank survey of about
100 economists. That compares to the central bank’s forecast of
3.1 percent growth.  The real weakened 0.2 percent to 2.0484 per  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
