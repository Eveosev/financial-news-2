Swedish business and  consumer
confidence  unexpectedly slumped in May as the largest Nordic
economy struggles to overcome a recession in the euro area.  The  consumer confidence  index fell to 3.6 from 5.2 the
previous month, the Stockholm-based National  Institute of
Economic Research  said today. Economists predicted confidence
would rise to 6.5, according to the median of 11 forecasts in a
Bloomberg  survey . A  manufacturing confidence  index fell to minus
15 from a revised minus 9. It was estimated to stay unchanged.  Sweden’s central bank last month postponed a planned
 interest rate  increase by about a year to late 2014 as a strong
krona has put a lid on inflation and as companies in the $500
billion economy struggle with slack demand. The bank resisted
calls to cut rates, citing concerns over financial imbalances
after  household debt  hit records last year.  Sweden , which exports about half of its output, has been
suffering from weak demand from the euro area, where the economy
is estimated to contract for a second year.  Unemployment will
rise to an average 8.2 percent this year from 8 percent in 2012
as companies including Ericsson AB, the world’s largest maker of
mobile networks, cut jobs, the Riksbank predicted last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
