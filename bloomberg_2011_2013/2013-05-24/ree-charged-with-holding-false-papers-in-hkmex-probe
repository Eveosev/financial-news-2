Three men arrested as part of a probe
into the failed  Hong Kong  Mercantile Exchange were charged today
with having false documents including letters related to a $460
million cheque and $11 million of funds.  Kowloon City Magistrate Clement Lee denied bail to the men,
all from mainland  China , and adjourned the hearing. No mention
of HKMEx was made in the charges or in court.  HKMEx lost its trading license last week after the
Securities and Futures Commission determined it didn’t have
sufficient financial resources. The regulator found “serious”
suspected irregularities in the financial affairs of the company
and referred the case to the police.  HKMEx Chairman  Barry Cheung , its founder and largest
shareholder, has said the three men aren’t current or former
employees. Cheung, who ran the 2012 election campaign for the
city’s Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, has taken a leave of
absence from all public positions including his membership of
Leung’s Executive Council.  To contact the reporters on this story:
