Short interest in  Vestas Wind Systems
A/S (VWS) , the wind turbine maker with the most installed capacity,
fell to its lowest in more than 2 1/2 years, Markit data on
Bloomberg show.  Short positions in Vestas fell to 9.9 percent of
outstanding shares as of May 22, the most recent data. Thatâ€™s
the lowest since Sep. 30, 2010, according to Markit data. Short
sellers borrow stocks and sell them in the anticipation of
profiting by repurchasing the securities later at a lower price.  Short interest in Vestas has been falling since last month,
on evidence that the Aarhus, Denmark-based company company is
delivering on its two-year turnaround plan. The manufacturer on
May 8 posted a narrower first-quarter loss than a year earlier,
and its shares in the past month had their longest winning
streak since the 1998 initial public offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
