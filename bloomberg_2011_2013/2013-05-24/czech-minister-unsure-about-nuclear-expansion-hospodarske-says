Czech Finance Minister Miroslav
Kalousek has doubts whether building two new reactors at state-controlled utility CEZ’s Temelin nuclear plant is an
“efficient” investment,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing an
interview.  The cost of the project included in the two Temelin tender
bids was a “very unpleasant surprise,” Hospodarske quoted
Kalousek as saying. Expanding the Temelin nuclear power plant
may cost as much as 300 billion koruna ($14.8 billion), the
newspaper said, without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
