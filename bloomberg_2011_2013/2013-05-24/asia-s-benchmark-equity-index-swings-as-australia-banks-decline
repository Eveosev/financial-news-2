Asia ’s benchmark regional  stock  index
swung between gains and losses as Australian banks declined and
the yen rose after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said
the central bank had announced sufficient stimulus.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.2 percent to 138.42 as
of 2:46 p.m. in  Tokyo . The gauge is heading for a 2.9 percent
decline this week, the most since July. Australian banks headed
for the largest weekly drop in a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
