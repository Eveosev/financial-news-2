Although she walked down the aisle in the backyard,  Drew Barrymore’s Santa Barbara home  doesn’t seem to have too much of a hold on her. The actress has listed the Montecito-area home for $7.5 million just a year after getting married, according to property records and  The Real Estalker blog . Barrymore reportedly bought the home in June 2010 for $5.705 million. The estate is out of the way from the buzz of Hollywood on a secluded 2 acres — ideal for a quiet, paparazzi-free wedding and starting her family with new husband Will Kopelman. With a spacious 6,000-square-foot floor plan and 6 bedrooms, an upgrade in size isn’t needed. However with Kopelman from New York, the couple could be considering a move back East. Barrymore also owns another SoCal-area home she bought in 2002. The “Never Been Kissed” actress’ two-story classic was built in 1937 with a long gravel driveway and a separate guest house. Inside, the home is markedly traditional, although Barrymore’s quirky nature is apparent in the kitchen, where a sunny yellow table serves as the island and the two fridges are vintage — one in a bright aqua shade. The grounds feature a long stretch of lawn, as well as a grove of citrus and avocado trees. The home is listed by  Suzanne Perkins of Sotheby’s International Realty . Related items from  Zillow Blog :
