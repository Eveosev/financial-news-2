The European Union has had
difficulties with its stress tests on banks, said  Michel Barnier , the bloc’s financial services chief.  “This has been a difficult exercise conducted in a
sensitive political and financial climate,” he said at a
conference in Brussels today.  The European Banking Authority has been “dependent” on
information provided by national supervisors. Still, he said
that “each new round of stress tests has been an improved
one.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
