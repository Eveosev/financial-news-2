American Airlines’ proposal for
severance pay of $20 million to Chief Executive Officer Tom Horton as part of the carrier’s merger with  US Airways Group
Inc. (LCC)  is opposed by the U.S.  The payment violates bankruptcy law, the U.S. Trustee’s
office, a part of the Justice Department that monitors
bankruptcy proceedings, said yesterday in a court filing in New
York.  American parent  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ)  has sought court approval of the
severance under its plan to exit court protection by merging
with US Airways. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane in Manhattan
denied approval of the pay when he approved the merger agreement
in March.  The government said in its filing that severance provision
for Horton prevents court approval of the bankruptcy plan. Lane
is scheduled to consider at a June 4 hearing whether creditors
can vote on the plan.  Sean Collins, a spokesman for Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR,
said in an e-mailed statement that the company didn’t expect
creditor voting to be delayed. He didn’t respond specifically to
the government’s opposition to the proposed severance.  The case is in re AMR Corp., 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
