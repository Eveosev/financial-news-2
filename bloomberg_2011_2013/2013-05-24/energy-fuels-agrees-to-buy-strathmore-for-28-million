Energy Fuels Inc. (EFR) , a uranium producer
with operations in the U.S., signed a letter of intent to buy
 Strathmore Minerals Corp. (STM)  for C$29.1 million ($28.2 million) in
stock to add properties in Wyoming and  New Mexico .  Strathmore investors will receive 1.47 shares of Toronto-based Energy Fuels for each share they own, the companies said
in a joint statement today. The deal, which is subject to a
definitive agreement, represents a 31 percent premium to
Vancouver-based Strathmore’s stock, based on closing prices
yesterday.  Companies exploring for metals and minerals are being
starved of cash after market values plunged this year as
 commodity  prices, including uranium, declined. Strathmore had
C$2.95 million in cash at the end of March, 45 percent less than
it held as of Dec. 31, according to company  filings .  The transaction will allow for operational synergies
between Energy Fuels’ White Mesa uranium mill and Strathmore’s
Roca Honda project in New Mexico, Rob Chang, a Toronto-based
analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, said in an e-mail today.  Strathmore gained 31 percent to 24 cents in Toronto. Energy
Fuels rose 6.3 percent to 17 cents.  Uranium, which slid to a seven-year low of $40.25 a pound
on April 24, has declined 5.8 percent this year, to $40.75,
according to Metal Bulletin data. The price climbed as high as
$138 in June 2007.  Energy Fuels’ financial advisers on the deal are Haywood
Securities Inc. and Dundee Securities Ltd. and its legal adviser
is Borden Ladner Gervais LLP. Strathmore is being advised by
 Raymond James Ltd . and Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
