Cocoa fell to a one-week low in
London on speculation rainfall in top grower  Ivory Coast  will
boost prospects for the crop. Sugar advanced and coffee slid.  Growing areas in West Africa, the main growing region, got
rain last week, with the heaviest amounts falling over
southwestern Cameroon and southern Ivory Coast, MDA Weather
Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said in a report e-mailed on
May 21. Ivory Coast is harvesting the smaller of two annual
crops known as the mid-crop. Wet weather at this time of the
year usually favors the development of the next crop.  “More rain in the Ivory Coast was seen as beneficial for
the mid-crop there,” Arthur Liming, a futures specialist at
Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Cocoa for delivery in July slid 0.5 percent to 1,529 pounds
($2,310) a metric ton by 11:01 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London . The
price fell to as low as 1,525 pounds, the lowest since May 17.
Cocoa for July delivery dropped 0.9 percent to $2,263 a ton on
ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  July cocoa yesterday in New York fell below its recent
trading range, Liming said.  Ivory Coast’s central-western Daloa region, which has
average annual production of about 300,000 tons of cocoa, got
40.3 millimeters (1.6 inches) of rain from May 11 to May 20,
according to the country’s National Meteorological Service. That
is higher than the historical average of 39 millimeters. In the
southwestern Soubre region, Sassandra got 55.1 millimeters
compared with 56 millimeters for the long term.  Robusta coffee futures for July delivery were 1.2 percent
lower to $1,964 a ton in London. Arabica coffee futures for July
delivery were unchanged at $1.3005 a pound in  New York .  Raw sugar for delivery in July rose 0.4 percent to 16.83
cents a pound on ICE. White, or refined, sugar for delivery in
August was up 0.3 percent to $476.10 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
