Rubber rebounded from the biggest
drop in a month as  Japan ’s currency resumed a decline against
the dollar, raising the appeal of yen-denominated futures.  The contract for delivery in October on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange gained as much as 1 percent to 277.7 yen a kilogram
($2,711 a metric ton) and was at 275.2 yen at 10:51 a.m., paring
a second weekly loss to 4.4 percent. Futures fell 5.3 percent
yesterday, the most since April 15.  The yen weakened to 102.59 per dollar after advancing to
100.83 yesterday, the highest level since May 10. The currency
was bought as haven as Japanese shares fell the most since 2011
amid concerns about the global recovery.  “Futures were oversold yesterday,” Hideshi Matsunaga, an
analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co., said by phone today. “The
strength of Thai rubber prices, regardless of the sell-off in
Tokyo, also spurred investors to buy back futures.”  Thai rubber free-on-board was unchanged at 91.15 baht
($3.04) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand . It was the highest level since Feb. 22.  Indonesian rubber growers have asked the government to
coordinate action with Thailand and Malaysia to keep prices at
$3.50 a kilogram, Asril Sutan Amir, adviser to the Rubber
Association of  Indonesia , said yesterday. Thailand is the
world’s largest producer followed by Indonesia and Malaysia.  Rubber for delivery in September on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 1.4 percent to 19,495  yuan  ($3,178) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
