St. John’s University in New York
agreed to sell its lower Manhattan campus to a group including
developer Steven Witkoff and property investor Fisher Brothers,
which plan to build condominiums at the site.  Selling the property at 101 Murray St. will give the
university a “major infusion of capital,” President Donald Harrington said in a statement today. Proceeds will be used for
student financial aid, academic programs and facility
improvements, the university said. The sale price, which the
seller didn’t disclose, will exceed $200 million, said a person
with knowledge of transaction.  The developers plan to tear down a 10-story building on the
property and build a condo project, said the person, who asked
not to be named because the details are private. The partners
“are dedicated to creating the highest and best use for 101
Murray,” Winston Fisher, a Fisher Brothers partner, said in the
statement.  It’s “a property that is situated in the very heart of one
the most dynamic mixed-use neighborhoods in the world,” Fisher
said.  Jody Fisher, a spokesman for Fisher Brothers, and Jennifer
Little, a spokeswoman for Witkoff Group, didn’t immediately
return telephone calls seeking comment on the development.  St. John’s will continue to occupy the building until
mid-2014, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
