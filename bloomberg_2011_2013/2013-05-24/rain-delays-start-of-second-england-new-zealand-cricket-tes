The start of the second cricket Test
between  England  and New Zealand at Headingley in Leeds has been
delayed by rain.  The umpires will not inspect the pitch until the rain
stops, after which it will take 90 minutes before play can
start, according to the England and Wales Cricket Board’s
website. An early lunch will be taken at 12:30 p.m. local time.  England leads the two-match series 1-0 following its 170-run win at Lord’s in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
