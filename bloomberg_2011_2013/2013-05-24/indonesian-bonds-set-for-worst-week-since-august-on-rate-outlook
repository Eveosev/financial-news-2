Indonesian bonds headed for their
worst week since August, driving the 10-year yield to a seven-month high, after the central bank signaled it will start
increasing borrowing costs. The rupiah declined.  “We already changed to neutral since February last year
and now we’re even moving toward a tightening bias,” Deputy
Governor Perry Warjiyo said in a May 22 interview in Jakarta.
The monetary authority has kept its  benchmark rate  unchanged at
a record low 5.75 percent since February 2012. The government
plans to boost net debt sales to 241.3 trillion rupiah ($24.7
billion) in the revised 2013 budget to fund a widening  fiscal
deficit , up from a previous target of 180.4 trillion rupiah,
Finance Minister Chatib Basri said this week.  “Warjiyo’s comments opened wide the possibility of rate
hikes this year,” said Suriyanto Chang, head of treasury at PT
Bank QNB Kesawan in Jakarta. “Yields will probably keep rising
on expectation of higher rates and increased debt supply.”  The yield on government notes due May 2023 rose 18 basis
points this week to 5.77 percent as of 9:07 a.m. in Jakarta, the
most since the five days ended Aug. 31, prices from the Inter
Dealer Market Association show. The rate, which is steady today
at the highest level since Oct. 16, may rise to as much as 6
percent this year, Chang said.  The local currency was little changed for the day at 9,775
per dollar, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The spot contract was at a 0.8 percent premium to
one-month non-deliverable forwards, which declined 0.1 percent
this week and 0.2 percent today to 9,853 per dollar, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Rupiah Outlook  The rupiah weakened the least among emerging Asian
currencies this week, falling 0.2 percent. That compared with
declines of 0.9 percent for the Philippine peso and 1 percent
for  South Korea ’s won after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  signaled a possible decrease in monthly bond buying
that boosts the supply of dollars.  “Bank  Indonesia ’s willingness to counter inflation will be
positive for the rupiah,” Chang said, predicting the currency
will appreciate to about 9,500 by year-end.  The central bank will require local lenders to use its
Jakarta Interbank Spot Dollar Rate to settle local-currency
derivatives, which it set for the first time on May 20,
Executive Director Difi Johansyah said on the day. The  fixing 
was 9,774 yesterday, 0.3 percent stronger than the 9,800 set by
the Association of Banks in  Singapore , used to settle the non-deliverable forwards.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, climbed 11 basis
points this week and fell 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage
point, today to 6.70 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
