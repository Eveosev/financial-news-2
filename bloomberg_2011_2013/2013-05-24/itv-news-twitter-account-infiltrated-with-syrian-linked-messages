ITV Plc (ITV) , owner of the U.K.’s biggest
commercial TV station, suffered a Twitter account hack today
with postings attributed to the “Syrian Electronic Army,” a
name also used last week when The Financial Times’s social media
accounts were infiltrated with links to war atrocity videos.  The  @itvlondon  account on Twitter Inc. posted six messages.
One said “ Francois Hollande  to double aid to rebels, including
a complementary French flag with every aid package,” with a
picture of a white flag against a blue, cloudy sky.  Another post said “Twitter finally defeats the #Syria-n
electronic army,’ with a link to an Independent newspaper
article. That was followed by another message, which read “Just
kidding. The Syrian Electronic Army was here. #SEA via
@Official_SEA12.”  The messages have now been deleted. ITV confirmed that it
had been hacked, according to a post on its main Twitter
account. The London-based TV news service is the latest to be
hijacked following last week’s attack on The FT’s accounts and
last month’s hacking on the  Associated Press ’s Twitter account.  To contact the reporter on this story:
