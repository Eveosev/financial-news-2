Grupo Soares da Costa SGPS SA  rose
the most in more than 18 years after Jornal de Negocios reported
that Angolan investors are interested in buying a stake in
 Portugal ’s third-biggest publicly traded builder.  The shares rose 33 percent, the biggest one-day jump since
November 1994, to 24 euro cents, bringing the advance this year
to 85 percent. That gave the Oporto-based company a market value
of 38.4 million euros ($49.6 million). Trading volume was almost
15 times the three-month daily average.  A group of Angolan investors is interested in buying a
stake in Soares da Costa,  Jornal de Negocios  reported today,
citing an unidentified person in Luanda, the Angolan capital.
Soares da Costa Chief Executive Officer Antonio Castro Henriques
wasn’t immediately available for comment.  Soares da Costa is among Portuguese builders making inroads
in  emerging markets  such as  Angola , while the government in its
home country cuts spending to comply with terms of a 78 billion-euro bailout from the European Union and  International Monetary
Fund . The company’s sales in Angola climbed 8.6 percent last
year to 353.5 million euros while revenue in Portugal dropped 28
percent to 236.5 million euros.  “There is talk about Angolans taking a stake in Soares da
Costa,” said Jose Novo, a trader at Orey iTrade in Lisbon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
