Otokar Otomotiv ve Savunma Sanayi AS ,
a Turkish producer of civilian and military vehicles, rose to a
record after Hurriyet Daily News reported the company could sell
tanks to Saudi Arabia.  The  stock  jumped 5.7 percent to 92.25 liras at 3:22 p.m. in
Istanbul, the highest level since the company started trading in
April 1995. More than 183,000 shares changed hands, about 11
times the stock’s three-month daily average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  Borsa Istanbul National 100 (XU100)  index
rose 0.2 percent to 91,492.38.  The company in which  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL)  has a 44.7 percent
stake may sell hundreds of Altay tanks to Saudi Arabia, Hurriyet
reported today, citing unidentified defense officials.  Turkey ’s
Undersecretariat of Defense signed an agreement to develop Altay
-- described as “the first original main battle tank” produced
in Turkey -- five years ago. The company plans to start
production in 2015, the state-run Anatolia news agency reported
in November last year.  “Though 2015 is a long way down the road, investors are
already pricing in expectations over Altay,” Serhat Kaya, an
analyst at Oyak Securities in Istanbul, said in a phone
interview today. “The reported interest from Saudi Arabia seems
to have increased hopes further.”  The company’s press office in Istanbul declined to comment.  The second prototype of “Altay” was exhibited at the 11th
International Defense Industry Fair from May 7 to May 10 in
Istanbul. The development cost of the tank will be about $500
million, the company said on its website.  Otokar reported a non consolidated profit of 25.3 million
liras ($14 million) in the first quarter, compared with 6.33
million liras a year earlier, according to a company statement.
Its shares have surged 118 percent this year, outperforming the
17 percent advance in the benchmark index. Two analysts
recommend investors buy the shares, three say hold and one
recommends a sell, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
