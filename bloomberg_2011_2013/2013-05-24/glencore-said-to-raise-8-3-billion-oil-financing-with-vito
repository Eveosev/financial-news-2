Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  and Vitol
SA, the world’s two biggest oil traders, raised $8.3 billion in
loans to fund their crude-purchase deal with  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) ,
according to three people with knowledge of the matter.  The five-year deal increased from $7.5 billion after 10 to
15 lenders joined the facility, said the people, who asked not
to be identified because the terms are private. Further banks
have the option to commit to the deal, which can be increased to
as much as $10 billion.  Specially-created companies are raising the prepayment
loan, which will be backed by a portion of future  oil production 
of Moscow-based Rosneft, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Russia’s largest oil company signed contracts and
will receive a prepayment of as much as $10 billion for 67
million tonnes of crude, according to a March 6 statement.  A spokesman for Glencore in Baar,  Switzerland , who asked
not to be named citing company policy, declined to comment on
the financing.  Elizabeth Adams , a London-based spokeswoman for
Vitol, also declined to comment.  About 15 banks committed to the deal earlier this year
after an initial stage of syndication, people familiar with the
matter said at the time. Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas SA,
Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and Societe Generale SA marketed the debt as
bookrunners, the data show.  The loan pays interest at 210 basis points, or 2.1
percentage points, more than the London interbank offered rate,
Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
