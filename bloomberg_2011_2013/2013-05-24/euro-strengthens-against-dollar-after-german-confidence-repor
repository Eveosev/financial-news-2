The euro advanced against the dollar
after a report showed German business confidence increased in
May for the first time in three months, adding to signs that
growth in Europe’s largest economy is gathering pace.  The Ifo institute’s  business climate index , based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 105.7 from 104.4 in
April. That’s the first gain since February. Economists
predicted sentiment to remain unchanged, according to the median
of 44 forecasts in a  Bloomberg News survey .  The euro climbed 0.4 percent to $1.2982 as of 9:32 a.m.
London time. The 17-nation shared currency gained 0.3 percent to
132.36 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
