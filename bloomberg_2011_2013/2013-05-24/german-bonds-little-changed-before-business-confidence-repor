Spanish bonds fell, with 10-year
yields posting the biggest two-day gain in more than three
months, as the  Federal Reserve ’s signal it may slow asset
purchases reduced demand for higher-yielding assets.  Spain’s 10-year yields had their biggest weekly increase
since October. German bunds posted a weekly  drop , pushing yields
to a 10-week high, as a report showing orders for U.S. durable
goods increased more than forecast in April backed the case for
the Fed to reduce so-called quantitative easing. European
equities fell for a second day.  “Everybody is looking at the Fed, that’s the biggest talk
in town at the moment,” said Christian Lenk, a fixed-income
analyst at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “We are still in a mode
where the market is trying to find a fair price for Spanish and
Italian debt, the major drivers in the periphery.”  Spain ’s 10-year yields climbed 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 4.42 percent at the 5 p.m. close in  London 
after rising to 4.46 percent, the highest since April 23. The
23-basis point increase over the past two days is the most since
the period through Feb. 4. The 5.4 percent bond due in January
2023 fell 1.025, or 10.25 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,292) face
amount, to 107.57. The rate has increased 21 basis points since
May 17, the  most  since the period ended Oct. 26.  Italy’s 10-year yield rose 11 basis points to 4.14 percent.
It gained 24 basis points  this week , the most since March 29.  Yields Climb  Italy’s 10-year yield has climbed from as low as 3.68
percent on May 3, the  least  since February 2006. The rate on
similar-maturity Spanish bonds dropped to 3.94 percent on that
day, the  lowest  since May 2010.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on May 22 that the
central bank could begin to reduce the monthly pace of bond
purchases in the next few meetings if it can be confident of
sustained gains in the economy. The U.S. central bank is buying
$85 billion of government and mortgage securities each month to
cap borrowing costs.  Germany ’s 10-year yield dropped one basis point to 1.43
percent after rising to 1.47 percent, the highest level since
March 15.  Bunds fell earlier as an industry report showed business
confidence in the euro-region’s largest economy unexpectedly
increased in May.  The Ifo institute’s  business climate index , based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 105.7 from 104.4 in
April. Economists predicted sentiment would remain unchanged,
according to the median of 44 forecasts in a  Bloomberg News
survey. (GRIFPBUS)   German Growth  Gross domestic product  in Germany rose 0.1 percent in the
first quarter after slipping 0.7 percent in the previous three
months, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said in a
separate report.  “The data is pointing to an economic recovery in Germany
as well as the broader euro-zone economy,” said Ralf Umlauf, a
research analyst at Helaba Hessen-Thueringen in Frankfurt.
“Bunds have also been a little bit burdened by the talk of QE
tapering in the U.S. later in the year.”  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares fell 0.2 percent after
declining 2.1 percent yesterday, the most since July 23.  U.S.  orders for goods  meant to last at least three years
increased 3.3 percent last month after dropping 5.9 percent in
March, the Commerce Department said in  Washington . The median
forecast from 78 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected a
1.5 percent increase.  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Italy and  Portugal , according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Spanish  government bonds  dropped 0.8 percent this month
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
Italian securities declined 0.2 percent and German bonds lost
1.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
