Shares of  Niko Resources Ltd. (NKO)  soared
the most in 17 years after announcing a gas discovery off the
east coast of  India .  Niko jumped 23 percent to C$7.35 at 4 p.m in Toronto, the
biggest rise since May 1996. The Calgary-based firm is down 31
percent in 2013, the fourth worst-performing stock in the
S&P/TSX Energy Index during that period.  Niko, along with partners Mumbai, India-based  Reliance
Industries Ltd. (RIL)  and  BP Plc (BP/) , based in  London , announced today
they discovered “significant gas condensate” after drilling a
well off India’s east coast.  The discovery, named “D-55”, showed good flow potential
and further testing will be done to define the scale and quality
of the field, the companies said in a statement.  Alan Knowles, an analyst with Haywood Securities Inc., said
the discovery may boost Niko’s reserves by 31 percent to 96
percent compared with the end of 2012, representing $225 million
to $700 million in value to the company.  “We shall embark on the appraisal program in the next few
months in order to evaluate the options for developing this
discovery,” P.M.S. Prasad, executive director at Reliance
Industries, said in the statement.  Niko owns a 10 percent stake in the “KG D6” venture,
while Reliance operates the KG D6 block with a 60 percent stake.
BP owns the remaining 30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
