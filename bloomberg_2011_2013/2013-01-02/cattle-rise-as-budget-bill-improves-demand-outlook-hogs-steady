Cattle futures rose for the second
time in three sessions after U.S. legislators passed a budget
deal to avert automatic tax increases and spending cuts, buoying
the outlook for meat demand. Hog prices were little changed.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
climbed as much as 1.6 percent after the House of
Representatives approved a bill to avert the so-called fiscal
cliff and prevent income taxes from rising for most U.S.
workers. President  Barack Obama  said he will sign the bill that
makes the George W. Bush-era income-tax cuts permanent for
Americans while letting them expire for top earners.  The bill’s passage “means optimism of better meat demand
simply because disposable income is going to stay relatively
unscathed for the majority of the people,” Lawrence Kane, a
market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group, said in a telephone
interview from Yates City,  Illinois .  Cattle futures for February delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$1.3255 a pound at 9:34 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Prices rose 8.9 percent in 2012, the fourth straight gain and a
record rally.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement added 0.2
percent to $1.546 a pound.  Hog futures for February settlement gained 0.1 percent to
85.775 cents a pound in  Chicago . The commodity rose 1.7 percent
in 2012, the fifth straight increase and the longest rally since
at least 1987, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg.
