AS Tallink Grupp (TAL1T) , the largest Baltic
ferry company, jumped to a five-year high on speculation a fund
managed by Citigroup Inc. will increase its stake.  The shares rose 3 percent to 0.89 euro at the close in
Tallinn, valuing the company at 600 million euros ($795
million). Volume of 403,374 shares was more than twice the
three-month daily average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  OMX Tallinn stock index  rose 2.5 percent to
752.86 today, the highest since March 2011.  Tallink has gained 15 percent since it said on Dec. 13 that
Baltic Cruises Holding LP, a subsidiary of the CVCI Growth Fund
II managed by Citigroup Venture Capital International, bought a
15.7 percent stake, paying 1.1 euros a share. An agreement gave
Baltic Cruises the right to buy more shares without the consent
of other large shareholders until April 30.  “The recent changes in ownership are what’s driving the
move, namely, speculation about possible further purchases and
about whether the price is heading toward that 1.1 euro level,”
Simmo Sommer, head of equity trading at Swedbank Baltic, said by
phone from Tallinn today.  Speculation that Tallink may pay its first dividend is also
boosting the stock price, Sommer said.  Baltic Cruises bought a combined 7.8 percent stake in
Tallink from two investment funds run by Citigroup, the ferry
operator said. It also bought shares from Firebird Republics
Fund Ltd., Amber Trust SCA and AS Infortar, which retain smaller
stakes, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
