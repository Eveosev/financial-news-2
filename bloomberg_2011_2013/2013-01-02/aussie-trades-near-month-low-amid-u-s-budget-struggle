The Australian dollar advanced to its
strongest level in more than a week as U.S. lawmakers passed a
budget bill to avert the so-called fiscal cliff threatening the
world’s biggest economy.  The Aussie dollar gained versus most of its 16 major
counterparts as President  Barack Obama  said he will sign the
bill into law, which will undo income tax increases for more
than 99 percent of households.  New Zealand ’s currency touched
the highest in two weeks, reversing an earlier decline, as the
resolution of the U.S. impasse helped propel Asian stocks.  “Now we’ve got a bit more clarity and the potential
uncertainty has been removed somewhat,” said Peter Dragicevich,
a Sydney-based currency economist at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , the nation’s largest lender. “The environment would
be pretty positive for risk assets on the day,” including the
Aussie, he said.  The Australian dollar rose 0.8 percent to $1.0481 as of
5:19 p.m. in Sydney after earlier climbing to $1.0494, the
highest since Dec. 20. It advanced 1.5 percent to 91.47 yen. The
yield on  Australia ’s  10-year bond  increased 13 basis points, or
0.13 percentage point, to 3.40 percent, the biggest one-day
increase since September.  New Zealand’s currency gained 0.9 percent to 83.61 U.S.
cents, and touched 83.97, the strongest since Dec. 19. The so-
called kiwi surged 1.5 percent to 72.97 yen.  Asian stocks rallied, with the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index
excluding Japan (MXAPJ)  rising 1.9 percent. Japanese markets are shut
for a holiday.  The U.S. House of Representatives passed the budget
legislation with a 257-167 vote last night in  Washington .
Republicans vowed to fight President Obama in coming weeks for
spending cuts in exchange for raising the nation’s debt ceiling.
Congress must act as early as mid-February to prevent a default
and the dispute may reprise a similar 2011 episode that led to a
downgrade of the U.S. credit rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
