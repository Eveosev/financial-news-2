Pakistan ’s  stocks  fell the most in
more than 14 months after a government coalition partner
endorsed a planned protest calling for electoral reforms.  The  KSE 100 Index (KSE100)  of 100 companies traded on the Karachi
Stock Exchange fell 2.1 percent to 16,451.39 at 2:48 p.m local
time. The gauge is headed for its biggest drop since Oct. 19,
2011.  Oil & Gas Development Co. (OGDC) , the nation’s biggest oil and
gas explorer, sank the most in a year.  MCB Bank Ltd. (MCB) , Pakistan’s
biggest lender by market value, sank to a three-week low.  Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri, a religious scholar and former
lawmaker who returned to Pakistan last month after a five-year
stay in  Canada , is planning a “million-man march” in Islamabad
on Jan. 14 to call for electoral reforms. The plan was endorsed
yesterday by the Muttahida Quami Movement, a Karachi-based
coalition partner of the ruling party.  “Political noise has increased as the planned march can
destabilize the political transition process,” said Faisal Bilwani, head of equity sales international at Elixir Securities
Pakistan Pvt Ltd in Karachi. The current government’s term ends
in March.  The KSE 100 has fallen 2.9 percent in the past three days
since closing at a record of 16,943.19 on Dec. 28. Its 14-day
relative strength index, which measures how  rapidly  stocks have
risen or fallen in that period, rose to 72 that day, above the
70 level that some investors use as a signal to sell.  The gauge trades for 6.8 times estimates for this year’s
earnings, down from a three-month high of 7 on Dec. 31,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The KSE 100 surged 49
percent last year, the most since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
