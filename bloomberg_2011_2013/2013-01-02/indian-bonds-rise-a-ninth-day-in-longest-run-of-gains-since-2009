India ’s 10-year bonds gained for a
ninth day, the longest winning run since November 2009, after
the government deferred a debt auction previously scheduled for
this week.  The  finance ministry  will seek to raise 120 billion rupees
($2.2 billion) in February instead of this week, the central
bank said in a statement on Dec. 31. The  Reserve Bank  of India
plans to purchase 80 billion rupees of notes at an open-market
auction on Jan. 4, it said in another statement the same day.
The yield on benchmark 2022 securities touched a two-year low
yesterday.  “The trading environment for bonds became favorable owing
to a lack of supply since the government rescheduled the current
week’s bond auction,” Mumbai-based analysts at Altius Fincap
Markets Ltd., including Rahul Chokshi, wrote in a research note
today. The central bank’s debt-purchase plan also supported
bonds, they wrote.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 dropped
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.99 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. It
touched 7.90 percent yesterday, the lowest level since Dec. 28,
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  India has a cash balance of 1.3 trillion rupees and may not
exceed its borrowing target for the year through March,
according to a government official, who declined to be
identified as the information isn’t public. Any additional
borrowing, if required, will be capped at 200 billion rupees,
according to the official.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, declined one
basis point to 7.58 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It
fell 14 basis points last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
