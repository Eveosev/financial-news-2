Macau casino revenue  rose 20 percent
to a record last month, beating analyst estimates, as Christmas
promotions drew more holiday-makers to the world’s biggest
gambling hub.  Casino revenue in the Chinese city jumped to 28.2 billion
patacas ($3.5 billion) in December, trumping the previous record
of 27.7 billion patacas in October, according to data from
Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau today. The
growth compares with the 17.5 percent median estimate of four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News, helping drive  Sands China
Ltd. (1928)  shares to a record high in Hong Kong.  “This is definitely better than our expectation, and much
higher than the street estimates,” Jeremy Tan, a Hong Kong-
based analyst at Kim Eng Securities HK Ltd. said by phone,
“It’s a combination of higher holiday footfall, higher win-
rate, and a return to VIP market,” he said.  Sands China, the Hong Kong-listed unit of billionaire
 Sheldon Adelson ’s Las Vegas company, rose 5.3 percent to
HK$35.75, the highest close since its November 2009 debut.  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  also jumped 3.1 percent to
HK$31.30, the highest since at least October 1991, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index 
climbed 2.9 percent.  Full-year casino revenue in Macau increased 14 percent from
2011 to 304 billion patacas, also a record, according to the
Gaming Bureau.  Higher Earnings  Gambling revenue is climbing as operators including Sands
China, Galaxy and  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883)  expand in the
only place in China where casinos are legal. Middle-class
Chinese tourists have helped fuel growth even as high-stake
bettors cut spending.  Galaxy, controlled by Hong Kong business tycoon Lui Che- woo, plans to invest as much as $6.5 billion to expand a resort
on Macau’s Cotai strip and expects to begin construction at the
end of this year or the beginning of 2014, the company said last
month. The construction will cover about 10 million square feet
(929,000 square meters), more than doubling the size of its
existing resort.  Other operators including Wynn Macau Ltd.,  MGM China
Holdings Ltd. (2282)  and  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880)  received approvals to build
their first resorts on Cotai, a piece of reclaimed land that is
Asia’s equivalent of the Las Vegas Strip.  Visitor arrivals  in Macau rose 0.5 percent to 25.6 million
in the first 11 months of 2012, with 60 percent coming from
mainland China, the city’s Statistics and Census Service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
