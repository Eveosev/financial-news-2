Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom
LLP regained the lead among mergers and acquisitions legal
advisers in 2012, which saw a 7.8 percent drop in deal volume.  The  law firm , based in  New York , ranked No. 1 last year
with $294.5 billion in transactions, up from $287.4 billion
reported in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
firm participated in 13 percent of global mergers and
acquisitions by market value.  London-based Linklaters LLP was second, up eight spots from
2011, with $210.3 billion in transactions for 9 percent of the
market. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP was third with
$204.7 billion in transactions. Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, which
ranked first in 2011, fell to fifth place.  The total volume of M&A transactions fell to $2.22 trillion
in 2012 from $2.41 trillion in 2011, according to Bloomberg
data. Recession fears in  Europe , the cooling of developing
economies such as  China  and uncertainty about $600 billion in
automatic U.S. government spending cuts and tax increases, known
as the fiscal cliff, weighed on decision makers and damped the
pace of deals through much of last year.  “Simple year-over-year comparisons aren’t necessarily
perfect when looking at recent M&A cycles,” Matt Herman, head
of Freshfields’s U.S. corporate practice, said in an e-mail.  “For example, 2011 was influenced by a very strong first
four months, carried over from a spike that woke a dormant
market in August 2010. Similarly, while the general assumption
was that 2012 was going to start off strong, it didn’t pan
out.”  Skadden Deals  Skadden Arps  worked on 241 completed and pending deals for
the year including Tokyo-based Softbank Corp.’s planned purchase
of a stake in Sprint Nextel Corp. and Anheuser-Busch InBev NV’s
$20.1 billion purchase of half of Grupo Modelo SAB that it
didn’t already own.  The law firm was in the top spot most recently in 2010.  Eight of the top 10 legal advisers are U.S. firms, and
purchases of companies in the Americas accounted for roughly
half the global deal volume.  The Americas accounted for $1.37 trillion in deals compared
with $891.7 billion in Europe, and $531.6 billion in the Asia
Pacific region, excluding  Japan .  Japan accounted for $207.1 billion in deals followed by the
 Middle East  and  Africa  with $85.4 billion, according to the data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Skadden Arps took the top spot among cross-border announced
deals, ousting Freshfields, which fell to third place, according
to Bloomberg data. Skadden Arps also ranked No. 1 globally among
firms acting as advisers to buyers and sellers.  Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP led in deals involving private-
equity dollars. The law firm was fourth overall with $183.7
billion in transactions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
