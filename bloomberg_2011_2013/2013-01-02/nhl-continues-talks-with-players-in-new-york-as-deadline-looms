Talks between the  National Hockey
League  and its locked out players continue today in  New York  as
a midnight deadline approaches to dissolve the players’ union.  The 30-member executive board of the NHL Players’
Association has until shortly before midnight to decide whether
it will file a “disclaimer of interest,” resulting in the
union being dissolved. Players voted unanimously in December to
give the board the authority to file the disclaimer.  The deadline comes as the union reviews the most recent
contract offer from the NHL. The two sides have exchanged three
separate proposals in the past five days.  Before meeting in New York this week, the two sides hadn’t
held face-to-face negotiations since Dec. 13, when federal
mediators were present.  The NHL is seeking a deal by Jan. 11 to allow for training
camps to begin the next day, with a 48-game season set to start
Jan. 19.  The league has canceled 625 games, or 51 percent of the
season, through Jan. 14. In 1994-95, an NHL lockout ended Jan.
11 and a 48-game schedule began on Jan. 20. A lockout wiped out
the 2004-05 season, the only time an entire schedule was lost to
a labor dispute in a major North American sports league.  The sides are arguing over how to split revenue and other
issues, including salary arbitration and the length of
unrestricted free agency. League revenue grew to $3.3 billion
last season, up 50 percent from $2.2 billion in 2003-04.  Under the previous agreement, players received 57 percent,
or $1.9 billion, of the income. The remaining $1.4 billion, or
43 percent, was shared among the league’s 30 team owners. The
league this time has offered a 50-50 split.  To contact the reporter on this story:
