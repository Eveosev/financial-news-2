Czech stocks jumped, lifting the main
index the most in almost 11 months, as U.S. lawmakers’ agreement
on the budget boosted investor optimism about the global
recovery.  The PX gauge of 13 companies rose 2.6 percent to 1,066.01
by close in Prague, its steepest one-day advance since Jan. 26,
2012, and its highest level since August 2011.  Erste Group Bank
AG (RBAG)  of Austria, which has a 21 percent weighting in the Czech
index, rallied 4.1 percent.  Financial companies were among the biggest gainers in
Europe after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill
that averted spending cuts and tax increases threatening a
recovery in the world’s largest economy. Republicans vowed to
fight President  Barack Obama  in coming weeks for spending cuts
in exchange for raising the debt ceiling.  “A fall off the so-called fiscal cliff has been averted in
the last minute,” Jiri Simara, a stock analyst at Cyrrus AS
brokerage in Brno,  Czech Republic , wrote in a report today.
“While uncertainty remains, even the partial solution was
enough to give strong gains to stock indexes.”  New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest Czech producer of
coking coal and the most-traded stock in Prague today, jumped
3.5 percent to 101 koruna, its highest close since July 19.
Europe’s benchmark coal contract, which lost 15 percent last
year, surged 8 percent to $102.55 a metric ton today in the
Netherlands, the steepest advance in three years.  The  PX (PX)  index increased 14 percent in 2012, the same as for
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index and compared with a 13 percent gain
by the MSCI World Index and 15 percent for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index. The 14-day relative strength  index  for the Czech
gauge rose to 78 today, above the 70 level that suggests in
technical analysis the asset may be overbought and poised for a
retreat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
