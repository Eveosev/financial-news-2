Lusaka, the Zambian capital, is
seeking financial and legal advisers for its first municipal
bond issuance.  The municipality will use the proceeds to build 3,500 high-
rise apartments, the Lusaka City Council said in a statement
published in the government-owned  Daily Mail  today.  The council plans to raise $500 million from local and
international investors through what will probably be a dollar-
denominated bond sale, Zambia’s Deputy Finance Minister Miles Sampa said in an interview Nov. 25. Africa’s biggest copper
producer will join Nigeria and South Africa as the only
countries on the continent to sell bonds to finance regional or
sub-national projects.  The planned municipal debt follows Zambia’s $750 million
Eurobond issue in September, the country’s first international
sale, which was 24 times oversubscribed.  Bidding for financial, legal and debt arrangement services
closes Feb. 7, the Lusaka City Council said.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and
Deutsche Bank AG arranged the Eurobond sale.  Nigeria ’s Lagos state sold its biggest bond of 80 billion
naira ($510 million) in November to fund infrastructure
projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
