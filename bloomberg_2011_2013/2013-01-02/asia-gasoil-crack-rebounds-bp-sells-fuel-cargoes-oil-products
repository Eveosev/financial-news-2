Asia ’s gasoil crack spread rebounded,
signaling increased profit for refiners making diesel.  BP Plc (BP/) 
sold gasoline and fuel oil cargoes in  Singapore , the region’s
largest oil-trading center.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude climbed 46
cents from Dec. 31 to $19.32 a barrel at 3:01 p.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
This  crack spread , a gauge of processing profit, widened for the
first time in a week. There was no trading in Singapore
yesterday because of the New Year holiday.  Jet fuel  dropped 55 cents to a discount of 5 cents a barrel
to gasoil, PVM said. A negative  regrade  shows it is unprofitable
to make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
futures fell $9.33 to $96.07 a metric ton at 5:23 p.m. Singapore
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack
spread, a measure of the profit from making the petrochemical
and gasoline feedstock, narrowed for a third day.  Socar Trading SA bought 25,000 tons of open-specification
naphtha for delivery in the first half of March from Glencore
International Plc at $963 a ton, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of traders who monitored the Platts window.  Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. purchased gasoline for a second day
in Singapore, the survey showed. The London-based trader
purchased 50,000 barrels of 92-RON grade, loading Jan. 17 to
Jan. 21, from Mercuria Energy Ltd. at $120.60 a barrel. BP sold
a similar cargo loading Jan. 23 to Jan. 27 to China
International United Petroleum & Chemical Co., or Unipec, at
$120.90 a barrel.  PetroChina Co. sold 50,000 barrels of 95-RON gasoline,
loading Jan. 19 to Jan. 23, to Royal Dutch Shell Plc at $124 a
barrel, according to the survey.  Fuel Oil  Mercuria bought 20,000 metric tons of 180-centistoke high-
sulfur  fuel oil  from BP at a discount of $3.75 a ton to
benchmark quotes, according to the Bloomberg survey. The cargo
is for Jan. 28 to Feb. 1 loading.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude narrowed $1.65 to $7.52
a barrel at 3:01 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. This
crack spread narrowed the most since October, indicating reduced
losses for refiners producing residual fuels.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade gained $1.50 to $10.25 a ton, PVM data showed. That’s the
widest  viscosity spread  in a week, meaning bunker, or marine
fuel, increased less than supplies used in power stations.  Refinery News  CPC Corp. delayed production at its No. 6 naphtha cracker
in Kaohsiung to June because of construction delays, said
Jessica Tang, a Taipei-based spokeswoman at  Taiwan ’s state
refiner. The facility will be able to produce 720,000 tons a
year of ethylene.  Tenders  Pakistan State Oil Co. sought to buy 1 million tons of
high-sulfur fuel oil for March to December delivery and 55,000
tons of low-sulfur grade for January, according to information
on the company’s website.  CPC bought about 100,000 tons of full-range naphtha last
week for February delivery to Kaohsiung, said two traders who
participate in the market, asking not to be identified because
they’re not authorized to speak to the media.  Essar Oil Ltd. offered to sell 55,000 tons of 92-RON or 95-
RON gasoline for January loading from Vadinar, said two traders
who asked not to be named because the information is
confidential.  Indian Oil Corp. offered to sell as much as 35,000 tons of
380-centistoke fuel oil for January loading from Chennai, said
two traders who participate in the market, asking not to be
named because the information is confidential.  Hindustan Petroleum Corp. offered to sell as much as 30,000
tons of vacuum gasoil for January loading from Visakhapatnam,
according to a document obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Bharat Petroleum Corp. sought to sell 20,000 tons of 380-
centistoke fuel oil for January loading from Kochi, said two
