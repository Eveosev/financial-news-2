Saudi Arabia â€™s National Water Company
has started work on a 500 million-riyal ($133 million) water
storage plant in Jeddah that aims to ensure secure water
supplies in the city, the Arab News said, citing NWC.  The first phase of a project due to be completed in 24
months includes tanks with a capacity of 1.5 million cubic
meters of water for each of the four phases, it said.  The NWC said total capacity of the project will reach 6
million cubic meters at a cost of about 2.2 billion riyal.
Projects to support the storage facility will include pipelines
from a desalination plant to the Faisaliya water plant and
another from Faisaliya to Buraiman, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
