Polish economic and inflation data
would justify a half-point interest-rate reduction and the
central bank’s decision next week will probably be “a close
call,” said Michal Dybula, an economist at  BNP Paribas SA. (BNP)   While a 50 basis-point rate cut was defeated six votes to
four at November’s meeting, according to minutes published
today, and was probably rejected by a slim margin again in
December, a quarter-point reduction is more likely this month,
Warsaw-based Dybula wrote.  Polish manufacturing contracted for a ninth month in
December, according to a purchasing managers’ index published
today by  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)  The inflation rate dropped to a two-
year low in November amid the weakest consumer demand in almost
10 years.  The bank will cut its key rate by another 125 basis points
through June, bringing it to 3 percent, BNP forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
