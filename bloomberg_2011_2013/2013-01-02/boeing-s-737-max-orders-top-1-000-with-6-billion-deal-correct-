Boeing Co. (BA)  won an order for 60 of its
upgraded single-aisle 737s from Aviation Capital Group LLC, a
deal with a $6 billion catalog value that pushed purchases of
the new jet past the planemaker’s full-year goal.  The sale was completed in December and consists of 50 of
the 737 Max-8 model and 10 of the Max-9 variant, Boeing said
today in a statement. Airlines and lessors typically buy at a
discount to list prices.  Aviation Capital’s acquisition boosted orders for the 737
Max to a total of 1,029, or 29 more than Chicago-based Boeing’s
target, as the planemaker plays catch-up with Airbus SAS. The
Max will feature more fuel-efficient engines and is set to enter
service in 2017, after the scheduled 2015 debut for Airbus’s
A320neo series.  “Reaching 1,000 orders in just over a year’s time from our
first order” shows the aircraft’s value for customers, said Bob Feldmann, vice president for the jet program. “Customers are
expressing confidence in our ability to deliver improved
performance on schedule.”  The planemaker was criticized after more than three years
of delays on its most recent all-new jet, the composite plastic
787 Dreamliner, which was delivered to its first customer in
late 2011.  Boeing unveiled plans to revamp the 737 with the Max
variant in July of the same year, more than seven months after
Airbus announced the neo, a lag that helped the European
planemaker book record narrow-body orders in 2011. Equipped with
Leap engines from  CFM International , a partnership of General
Electric Co. and  Safran SA. (SAF) , the Max reduces fuel usage and
carbon dioxide emissions by 13 percent.  List Prices  Boeing’s 737 Max 8 lists for $100.5 million, and the Max 9
for $107.3 million.  “This order is a major step in building our broad
portfolio of modern, fuel-efficient airplanes,” Denis
Kalscheur, chief executive officer of Aviation Capital, said in
a statement. The jet lessor, based in  Newport Beach ,  California ,
was founded in 1989, according to its website.  Boeing rose 2.3 percent to $77.07 at the close of New York
trading. The shares have climbed 5.1 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
