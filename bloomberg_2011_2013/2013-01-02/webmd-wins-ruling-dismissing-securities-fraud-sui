WebMD Health Corp. (WBMD) , an online
provider of medical information, obtained the dismissal of a
lawsuit brought by investors who claimed the company defrauded
them by releasing revenue forecasts it knew to be inflated.  U.S. District Judge John Keenan in New York dismissed the
lawsuit today while giving the investors 60 days to file a new
complaint. He said the plaintiffs failed to prove that
statements by the company from February 2011 to January 2012
were made with “actual knowledge” that they were false or
misleading.  WebMD and its executives “were not obligated to predict
correctly the particular factor that ultimately causes their
projection not to come true,” Keenan wrote in an opinion.  Kate Hahn, a spokeswoman for New York-based WebMD, and
Jeffrey Zwerling, a lawyer for plaintiffs including the Wayne
County Employees’ Retirement System, didn’t immediately return
telephone calls for comment on the ruling.  The case is In Re WebMD Health Corp., 11-cv-5382, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
