Germany ’s bonds slumped, with 10-year
yields rising the most in more than three months, after U.S.
lawmakers passed a bill undoing income-tax increases that
threatened growth in the world’s largest economy.  Dutch, Finnish and French securities also fell as progress
in avoiding the so-called fiscal cliff undermined demand for
refuge assets. Italian bonds rallied, with 10-year yields
dropping to the lowest level since December 2010, as the budget
agreement spurred investor appetite for higher yields. Germany
auctioned 4.15 billion euros ($5.5 billion) of two-year notes,
with the sale resulting in a yield above zero for the first time
since October.  “The compromise on the U.S. fiscal cliff is dominating
risk sentiment,” said Rainer Guntermann, a fixed-income
strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “It’s a pro-risk
environment and bund yields should correct a bit higher.”  Germany’s  10-year yield  rose 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 1.44 percent at the 5 p.m. close of trading
in London, the biggest increase since Sept. 14. The 1.5 percent
bond due September 2022 fell 1.145, or 11.45 euros per 1,000-
euro face amount, to 100.515.  The U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of the
Senate’s budget legislation as Republican lawmakers abandoned
efforts to add spending cuts to the bill, removing an impediment
to growth. The 257-167 bipartisan vote last night ended a
yearlong impasse over how to avert $600 billion in tax increases
and spending cuts that were due to take effect yesterday.  ‘Remain Nervous’  “While the consensus reached by the Democrats and
Republicans has avoided a politically initiated crisis there is
still much work to be done,” Mike Turner, head of strategy at
Aberdeen Asset Management Ltd. in Edinburgh, wrote in a note to
clients. “Until a long-term plan is agreed which reduces the
annual budget deficit to less than 3 percent of GDP, investors
are likely to remain nervous.”  Germany’s two-year note yield climbed five basis points to
0.031 percent after rising to 0.042 percent, the highest level
since Dec. 3. The rate dropped to a record minus 0.097 percent
on Aug. 2.  The nation sold two-year securities today at a yield of
0.01 percent, compared with minus 0.01 percent at the previous
auction on Dec. 5. Investors bid for 1.5 times the amount
allotted, compared with 1.9 times last month.  ‘Very Low’  The bid-to-cover ratio “was lower than when the bond was
last issued,” Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist at
Rabobank International in London, wrote in an e-mail to clients.
“The significant risk-on tone seen this morning following the
U.S. fiscal cliff news may well be making investors unwilling to
invest in German debt at these still very low yields.”  Italy ’s 10-year bond yields declined 22 basis points to
4.28 percent after falling to 4.27 percent, the lowest level
since Nov. 23, 2010. The extra yield investors demand to hold
the securities instead of similar-maturity German bunds shrank
to as little as 283 basis points, the narrowest since March 21.  The so-called spread has “finally” fallen below 287 basis
points, Italian caretaker Prime Minister Mario Monti wrote in a
Twitter post. On Dec. 3, he said he hoped the yield difference
would contract below that level.  Spanish  10-year yields  fell 23 basis points to 5.03
percent, the lowest level since March 13.  Euro-area manufacturing output shrank more than initially
estimated in December, adding to signs a recession will extend
into this year. The Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 46.1 from
46.2 in November, below an initial estimate of 46.3 published on
Dec. 14. Gauges for Germany,  France  and Italy were all below 50
last month, indicating a contraction, separate reports showed.  Most Volatile  Volatility on Dutch debt was the highest among euro-area
nations tracked by Bloomberg, followed by Finland and  Belgium ,
according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield
spreads and credit-default swaps.  Dutch 10-year yields climbed 13 basis points to 1.63
percent, while similar-maturity Finnish yields rose 12 basis
points to 1.64 percent and France’s increased eight basis points
to 2.08 percent.  German bonds returned 4.5 percent last year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities climbed 6
percent and Italy’s rose 21 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
