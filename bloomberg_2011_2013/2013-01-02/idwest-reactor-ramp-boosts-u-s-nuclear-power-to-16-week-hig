Nuclear-power generation rose to the
highest level in 16 weeks as a  Minnesota  reactor was restarted
and every U.S. region boosted output.  Generation  nationwide  advanced by 1.1 percent to 93,254
megawatts, or 91 percent of capacity, the most since Sept. 9,
according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by
Bloomberg. Output was 4.2 percent less than a  year earlier  and
at the  lowest level  for this time of the year since 2008. Seven
of 104 nuclear reactors were offline.  Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL)  started the 551-megawatt Prairie Island 1
reactor in Minnesota after it was shut Oct. 23 for scheduled
refueling and maintenance. The unit, located about 40 miles (64
kilometers) southeast of  Minneapolis , was operating at 7
percent.  Production at Fermi 2 in  Michigan , the  DTE Energy Co. (DTE)  plant
that can produce 1,122 megawatts of electricity, rose to 53
percent of capacity from 7 percent yesterday. The reactor, 25
miles south of  Detroit , was restarted two days ago after being
taken offline on Nov. 8.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  boosted output for the 1,297-megawatt Grand
Gulf 1 reactor in  Mississippi  to 31 percent of capacity from 18
percent yesterday. The unit, about 25 miles southwest of
Vicksburg, is ramping up after automatically shutting down on
Dec. 29 because of a turbine trip, according to an  event
notification  on the commissionâ€™s website.  Watts Bar  The Tennessee Valley Authority boosted generation at the
1,123-megawatt Watts Bar 1 reactor, about 55 miles southwest of
Knoxville,  Tennessee , to full power from 97 percent yesterday.
The unit had been cut to 20 percent two days ago to perform
maintenance on feed-water valve in the non-nuclear portion of
the plant, according to the company.  Nuclear-power generation rose by the most in the Midwest,
which gained 2.8 percent to 20,338 megawatts, or 95 percent of
capacity, the highest level since Oct. 14, NRC data show.  The Northeast increased 0.6 percent to 24,899 megawatts, or
100 percent of capacity, while production in the  mid-Atlantic
and Southeast  states advanced 0.5 percent to 28,891, or 91
percent of capacity. Western U.S. generation increased 0.9
percent to 19,126 megawatts, or 80 percent of capacity.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to
the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
