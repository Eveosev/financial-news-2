U.K. stocks  advanced, with the
benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  racing past the 6,000 mark for the
first time since July 2011, as U.S. lawmakers passed a bill that
prevented most scheduled tax increases from coming into effect.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  climbed at least
3.5 percent. Rio Tinto Group and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  pushed mining
shares higher.  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  gained 2 percent after Deutsche Bank AG
asked investors to buy the shares before the retailer releases
its Christmas-trading update on Jan. 10.  The FTSE 100 Index surged 129.56 points, or 2.2 percent, to
6,027.37 at the close in London, the highest level since July 7,
2011. The benchmark gauge rallied 5.8 percent in 2012 as the
 European Central Bank  announced an unlimited bond-buying plan
and the Federal Reserve expanded asset purchases. The broader
FTSE All-Share Index gained 2.1 percent today. Ireland’s ISEQ
Index added 1.6 percent, rising to the highest since April 2010.  “Investors are happy for now, as U.S. politicians reached
a budget deal and averted automatic tax increases,” said  Manish Singh , who helps manage $2 billion as head of investment at
Crossbridge Capital in London. “There might be another
Washington showdown in a few weeks over the debt ceiling, and
plenty of volatility for short-term traders. But ignoring that,
the trend line is still looking up for 2013.”  The U.S. House of Representatives passed the budget
legislation with a 257-167 vote just after 11 p.m. in Washington
yesterday. President  Barack Obama  said he will sign the bill
into law. The Senate approved the proposals 89-8 in the early
hours of Jan. 1.  Tax Cuts  The bill will reinstate tax cuts that expired Dec. 31 on
incomes of as much as $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for
married couples. Top earners will be taxed at 39.6 percent, up
from 35 percent last year.  The budget accord will also delay until mid-February the
automatic spending cuts that were scheduled to start this month.
The deal ends a payroll-tax cut of two percentage points,
reducing paychecks for U.S. workers with immediate effect.  Manufacturing in the world’s biggest economy expanded more
than projected in December. The  Institute for Supply
Management ’s  factory index  rose to 50.7 from 49.5 in November,
beating the 50.4 average forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
survey.  In the U.K., manufacturing expanded in December for the
first time in eight months, a report showed. The Markit
Economics  purchase managers’ index  climbed to 51.4 from 49.2 in
November, according to a release by the London-based
institution. A reading above 50 signals expansion. Economists on
average had forecast a reading of 49.1.  Banks, Miners  An index of  London-listed banks  surged to the highest in 19
months. Barclays advanced 5 percent to 275.6 pence, while Lloyds
gained 3.7 percent to 49.69 pence.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s
largest lender, rallied 2.9 percent to 665.7 pence and  Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN)  rose 2.3 percent to 1,610 pence.  A  gauge of mining stocks  in the FTSE 350 Index surged 5
percent, the most in more than three months.  Rio Tinto , the world’s second-largest mining company,
jumped 5.1 percent to 3,691 pence. BHP Billiton, the biggest,
added 3.7 percent to 2,208.5 pence.  Tesco Rating  Tesco advanced 2 percent to 342.75 pence after Deutsche
Bank analysts James Collins and Sally Ronald recommended buying
the shares. Britain’s biggest grocer will next week issue a
statement on its performance in the six weeks to Jan. 6.  “We expect Tesco to have done well relative to
competitors, against last year’s weak relative performance,”
they wrote in a note today.  BP Plc (BP/)  increased 1.5 percent to 431.3 pence after Europe’s
second-largest oil company said it started production in the
Skarv field in the Norwegian Sea. Output from the field will
reach 165,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of
the year, BP said.  Lamprell Plc (LAM)  jumped 20 percent to 113.25 pence, the most
since the company sold shares to the public in October 2006. The
oil-rig engineer said it has received waivers from lenders on
financial covenants that were due to be tested on Dec. 31. The
company’s working capital has improved “significantly” and net
cash position at the end of 2012 was around $100 million,
according to the statement.  J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY)  slid 2.6 percent to 336 pence for the
 biggest drop on the FTSE 100  as Oriel Securities analysts led by
Jonathan Pritchard said the shares look “vulnerable” in the
short term.  WM Morrison Supermarkets Plc (MRW)  lost 2.1 percent to 257.4
pence as Jefferies International Ltd. lowered its share-price
target to 310 pence from 330 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
