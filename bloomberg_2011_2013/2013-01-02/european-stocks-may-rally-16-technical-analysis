The Euro Stoxx 50 Index may rally 8
percent in January and as much as 16 percent in the next four to
five months, according to Gerard Sagnier, a technical analyst at
Aurel-BGC.  The benchmark jumped 2.5 percent today to its highest level
since August 2011 as U.S. lawmakers passed a budget bill that
avoided most scheduled tax increases threatening a recovery in
the world’s biggest economy.  Sagnier expects the benchmark index to rise to a 2,850
resistance level by the end of this month. This represents the
third point in a trend line that started on Oct. 24, he said.
The measure may then climb to 3,060, reaching the highs of 2011
in the next four to five months, he said.  “I’m very bullish after the index surpassed a double
top,” Sagnier said in a telephone interview. “This created a
change in the psychology of the market.”  A double top is a rise to a new level, a decline, and then
an increase to the same level. The Euro Stoxx 50 formed a double
top in March and September, and breached the level Dec. 10,
Bloomberg data show.  Stocks in the region posted the biggest annual rally in
three years in 2012, with the Euro Stoxx 50 climbing 14 percent,
as the  European Central Bank ’s program to purchase bonds of the
area’s weakest economies helped ease concern the euro currency
block will fracture.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
