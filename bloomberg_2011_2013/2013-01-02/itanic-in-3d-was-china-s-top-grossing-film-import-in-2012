James Cameron ’s “Titanic” in 3-D
was the top-grossing foreign film in China in 2012, yet fell
short of the ticket sales by a low-budget local comedy, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported.  The Cameron film had 935 million  yuan  ($150 million) in
ticket sales, behind the top-grossing domestic film, “Lost in
 Thailand ,” with sales of more than 1 billion yuan, Xinhua said.
The local film tells the story of two rival Chinese businessmen
and a pancake maker in Thailand.  The  film industry  in China earned 14.35 billion yuan at the
box office in the first eleven months of last year, with
domestic films accounting for less than half of the total,
Xinhua reported.  China ’s box office record was set in 2010 by
Cameron’s “Avatar” which took in nearly 1.4 billion yuan,
Xinhua reported.  “Lost in Thailand,” which cost 30 million yuan to make,
is the highest-grossing domestic Chinese film of all time,
Xinhua reported Dec. 30.  The Oscar-winning director, who spent 10 years developing a
3-D camera system, said in August he formed a venture with two
state-owned companies in China. Cameron Pace Group, which he
founded with cinematographer Vince Pace, formed CPG China with
state-owned Tianjin North Film Group and Tianjin High-tech
Holding Group.  Box office sales in China may exceed $5 billion by 2015 and
pass U.S. box office revenue of $11 billion by 2020, Cameron
Pace Group said at the time.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
