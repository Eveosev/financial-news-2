Canadian synthetic light crude
strengthened to its highest level in three weeks against U.S.
benchmark oil as a refinery restarted units and an oil-sands
upgrader underwent maintenance.  Consumers’ Co-Operatives Refineries Ltd. plans a February
restart of several production units damaged in an fire last fall
at its 94,980-barrel-a-day refinery in Regina, Saskatchewan,
Daryl Oshanek, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail today.  Syncrude, a synthetic light oil derived from bitumen,
strengthened from parity to a $2-a-barrel premium above U.S.
West Texas Intermediate, according to data provided by Calgary
oil broker Net Energy Inc. It was the highest price for Syncrude
since Dec. 11, according to historical data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Supplies of synthetic crude may also be limited by
maintenance begun Dec. 26 at  Nexen Inc. (NXY) ’s Long Lake upgrader in
 Alberta . Long Lake produced about 34,000 barrels a day at the
end of October, according to the company’s third-quarter
earnings release.  Western  Canada  Select, a heavy blend mainly produced from
oil sands bitumen, rose 85 cents a barrel to $32.25 below WTI,
according to Net Energy. The oil grade last traded at that level
on Dec. 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The heavy grade reached a record low of $42.50 below WTI on
Dec. 14, as traders were concerned that increasing production in
western Canada would overwhelm pipeline capacity.  Kearl Project  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) ’s 110,000-barrel-a-day Kearl project may
begin production in January, Chief Executive Officer Bruce March
said after a presentation at the Canadian Association of
Petroleum Producer’s investment symposium in Toronto on Dec. 10.  In the U.S., crudes produced offshore in the  Gulf of Mexico 
weakened.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI shrank 70 cents to
$18.75 a barrel as of 4:13 p.m.  New York  time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to
benchmark WTI narrowed 25 cents to the same level.  The premium for Mars Blend declined 60 cents to $13.90
above WTI. Poseidon slipped 65 cents to a $14.10 premium.
Southern Green Canyon fell 80 cents to a $14.10 premium and
 Thunder Horse  lost 25 cents to $16.25 above WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
