European stocks  rallied to the
highest in 22 months as U.S. lawmakers passed a budget bill that
avoided most scheduled tax increases threatening a recovery in
the world’s largest economy.  Rio Tinto Group and  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  climbed at least 4
percent each to lead mining companies and automakers higher as
Chinese manufacturing grew. ArcelorMittal gained the most in 11
weeks after selling a stake in its Canadian unit for $1.1
billion.  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  soared 4 percent as the U.S. budget
deal delayed defense spending cuts.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  jumped 2 percent to 285.33 at
the close of trading, the highest level since Feb. 28, 2011. The
gauge posted the biggest  annual rally  in three years in 2012,
rising 14 percent, as the European Central Bank’s program to
purchase bonds of the region’s weakest economies helped ease
concern the euro area will fracture.  “It’s good to get the U.S. budget deal resolved and to get
the details, as it’s been dragging on for a while,” said Andrea Williams, head of European equities at Royal London Asset
Management, which oversees about $1.1 billion. “Politics were a
real ball last year; this year started well.”  The number of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies
today was 29 percent higher than the 30-day average, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Germany ’s DAX Index advanced 2.2
percent to a five-year high and the U.K.’s  FTSE 100 (UKX)  climbed
above 6,000 for the first time since July 2011. The Swiss market
was closed for a holiday.  Budget Agreement  The U.S. House of Representatives passed the budget
legislation just after 11 p.m. in  Washington  yesterday, breaking
a yearlong impasse over how to head off more than $600 billion
in tax increases and spending cuts set to start taking effect
yesterday. President  Barack Obama  said he will sign the bill
after the 257-167 vote. The Senate approved the proposals 89-8
in the first hours of Jan. 1.  The deal will delay by two months automatic spending cuts
scheduled to start this month as Republican lawmakers abandoned
their effort to add further reductions to the deal. It
reinstates tax cuts that expired Dec. 31 on taxable income of
individuals up to $400,000 and of married couples of up to
$450,000, leaving top earners with a marginal tax rate of 39.6
percent, up from 35 percent last year.  The largest economic impact of the accord will come from
ending a two-percentage-point payroll-tax cut, a move that will
shrink paychecks for U.S. workers even as most income-tax
reductions that expired Dec. 31 are extended permanently.  Mining Stocks  A gauge of mining shares soared 4.6 percent for the largest
jump since September, leading gains among 19 industry groups in
the Stoxx 600. Rio Tinto rallied 5.1 percent to 3,691 pence, the
highest price in 10 months, and  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  surged 5.8
percent to 2,003.5 pence.  Thirteen of 14  members  of an index of auto-industry
companies in the Stoxx 600 advanced. Volkswagen, Europe’s
biggest carmaker, climbed 4 percent to 179 euros. Porsche SE
gained 3.1 percent to 63.61 euros and  Bayerische Motoren Werke
AG (BMW)  added 4.1 percent to 75.93 euros.  China ’s manufacturing expanded for a third month in
December, adding evidence that the recovery in the world’s
second-biggest economy will extend into the new year. The
Purchasing Managers’ Index was 50.6, matching the November
reading, the National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation
of Logistics and Purchasing said yesterday in Beijing. A reading
above 50 signals an expansion.  Manufacturing in the U.S. grew more than forecast in
December, according to a report released by The Institute for
Supply Management today. The ISM’s factory  index  rose to 50.7
from November’s 49.5, which was the lowest since July 2009.  ArcelorMittal Advances  ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s biggest steelmaker, gained 4.5
percent to 13.51 euros, the largest increase since Oct. 17.
China Steel Corp. and Posco led a group that agreed to pay $1.1
billion for a 15 percent stake in ArcelorMittal Mines Canada
Inc. to secure supplies of iron ore.  BAE Systems climbed 4 percent to 350.5 pence. The U.K.
military-aircraft manufacturer, which gets about 45 percent of
revenue from the U.S., may benefit from the budget bill’s two-
month delay to scheduled spending cuts to military programs.  A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S advanced 4.4 percent to 44,480
kroner as the head of north Asia operations for its container
shipping unit said trade between Asia and  Europe  will grow.
Demand for trade on the Asia-Europe route is expected to grow
until Lunar New Year in February as Chinese manufacturers
produce and export more, Tim Smith said in a Bloomberg
Television interview in Hong Kong today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
