state-run Mehr  news agency ’s polling center on public
perceptions of the June presidential elections.  Of those questioned, 46.8 percent said they would
definitely or most probably vote while 13.4 percent said they
were undecided, the state-run news agency said in a  report 
published yesterday. Of those surveyed, 7.5 percent said they
will probably not vote and 31.9 percent that they definitely
won’t.  A total of 42.9 percent said they were highly or somewhat
motivated to participate, Mehr said. Of those interviewed, 58
percent said the contest was highly or to some extent
significant, while 40.9 said it had little, or no significance
with 1.1 percent declining to answer.  Of the respondents, 44.8 percent said they will follow
elections news on state television or radio, 14.1 percent via
newspapers and 7.7 percent on websites, according to the poll;

their friends and the rest didn’t respond.  The poll was carried out on Dec. 13, when 1,246 individuals

a margin of error for the survey.  President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  isn’t eligible to seek a
third term in the June 14 presidential elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
