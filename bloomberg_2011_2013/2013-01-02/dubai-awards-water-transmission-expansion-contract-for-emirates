Dubai has awarded a contract for a
project to extend the metropolitan area’s water transmission
network by 416 kilometers (259 miles).  The 167 million-dirham ($45.5 million) project by Dubai
Electricity and Water Authority is part of plans by authorities
in the regional trade, tourism and financial hub to keep pace
with area water demands, DEWA said today.  The project, estimated to take 26 months to complete, plans
to install new water-transmission pipelines, reduce water losses
by renovating household connections, increase supply capacity
and boost flows “to meet the sharp demand for water in various
areas of Dubai,” DEWA Chief Executive Officer Saeed Mohammed Al
Tayer said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
