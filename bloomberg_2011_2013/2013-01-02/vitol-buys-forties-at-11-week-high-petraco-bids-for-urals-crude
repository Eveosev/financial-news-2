Vitol Group bought a cargo of  North
Sea  Forties crude at the highest price in more than 11 weeks.
Eni SpA and Petraco SpA failed to find a seller for Russian
Urals grade.  PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-owned oil company,
purchased 1.9 million barrels of West African crude for delivery
in March, said a company official.  North Sea  Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold Forties Lot F0115 at a premium
of 95 cents a barrel to Dated Brent for loading from Jan. 26 to
Jan. 28, a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring
the Platts pricing window showed. That’s the highest since Oct.
12, when a lot traded at $1 more than the benchmark.  Shell bid at plus 95 cents to Dated Brent for a Jan. 21 to
Jan. 23 cargo, while Chevron Corp was willing to pay 55 cents
more than the benchmark for Jan. 24 to Jan. 29 with neither
company finding a buyer, according to the survey.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days rose to 57 cents more than Dated Brent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a 3 cent premium
in the previous session and is the most since Dec. 21.  Brent for February settlement traded at $112.39 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $109.55 in the previous session. The March
contract was at $111.05 a discount of $1.34 to February.  Mediterranean/Urals  Eni failed to find a buyer for Russian Urals loading Jan.
13 to Jan. 17 at $1 a barrel discount to Dated Brent on a
delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , according to the Platts
survey. That compares with a lot the company bought on Dec. 13
at minus 25 cents.  In northwest Europe, Petraco bid unsuccessfully for one
consignment of the blend loading Jan. 23 to Jan. 27 at a $1.25
discount to Dated Brent, the survey showed. The grade traded at
$1.30 less than the benchmark on Dec. 24.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
was at minus $1.07, 28 cents wider than on Dec. 31, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. In northwest Europe, the  discount 
increased to $1.42 from $1.27 on Dec. 31, the data showed.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend was at $2.44 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, 4 cents less than on Dec. 31, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Pertamina bought two 950,000 barrel cargoes of Qua Iboe
crude, said the official, who asked not to be identified because
he isn’t authorized to speak to the media.  This was the country’s second tender for March. It earlier
bought 950,000 barrels each of Qua Iboe and  Libya ’s Amna grade,
as well as 650,000 barrels of Azeri Light, the official said
Dec. 21.  Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s largest refiner, issued a
