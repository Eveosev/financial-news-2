Thailand ’s baht rose to near a three-
month high on signs regional economic growth is gaining traction
and U.S. lawmakers are closing in on a budget deal to avert
automatic tax increases and spending cuts.  The currency added to a 3.1 percent gain in 2012 after
reports showed Singapore’s economy expanded more than economists
estimated last quarter and  China ’s manufacturing expanded for a
third month in December. Thailand’s  Finance Ministry  said on
Dec. 26 the nation’s gross domestic product will expand 5.7
percent in 2012, versus an earlier forecast of 5.5 percent, as
exports recover.  “The Thai economy is doing well on domestic consumption
and exports should pick up in 2013,” said Kampon Adireksombat,
a senior economist in Bangkok at Tisco Securities Co. “If we
get something on the U.S. budget, it will support capital
inflows and lift the baht higher.”  The baht rose 0.3 percent to 30.52 per dollar as of 9 a.m.
in Bangkok from 30.60 on Dec. 28, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the strongest level since Oct. 8. The currency
may advance to 30 by the end of 2013, Adireksombat said.  The  U.S. Senate  approved a bill, now being considered by
the House, that would make permanent the tax cuts for most
households that expired on Dec. 31, continue expanded
 unemployment benefits  and postpone spending cuts for two months.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, dropped to 3.81 percent
from 3.91 percent on Dec. 28. It fell 261 basis points, or 2.61
percentage points, in 2012.  The yield on the 3.875 percent government bonds due June
2019 rose three basis points to 3.26 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. It declined five basis points last year.  Consumer prices in  Southeast Asia ’s second-largest economy
probably rose 3.2 percent in December from a year earlier,
compared with 2.74 percent in November, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. The commerce ministry will
report inflation figures today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
