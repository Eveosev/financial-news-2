India ’s rupee rose to the highest
level in almost three weeks as U.S. lawmakers passed a bill to
avert $600 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts
that were set to take effect from today.  Asian stocks  advanced by the most in two weeks after the
House avoided higher taxes for most U.S. workers as Republicans
abandoned their effort to attach spending cuts that would have
been rejected by the Senate. Inflows into India, including
foreign direct investment and purchases of shares and bonds,
will be $74.5 billion in the year through March 2013, more than
an earlier prediction of $72 billion,  Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. (KMB) 
forecast in a report received today.  “The saving grace is capital flows, which appear to be
slightly better than expected,”  Indranil Pan , chief economist
at Kotak Mahindra in Mumbai, wrote in the report. “Current-
account deficit vulnerability will remain an issue.”  The rupee advanced 0.6 percent to 54.3600 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
54.2650 earlier, the strongest level since Dec. 13. The rupee
dropped 3.5 percent last year after plunging 16 percent in 2011.
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, increased five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 10.15 percent. The rate
decreased 190 basis points in 2012.  Global funds boosted holdings of domestic shares by $4.4
billion last month, taking inflows in 2012 to $24.5 billion,
exchange data show.  Gold Imports  India’s current-account deficit widened to a record $22.3
billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, official data showed Dec.
31, as a faltering global economy crimped exports. The world’s
largest bullion buyer may raise taxes on gold imports to curb
the shortfall, Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in
 New Delhi  today.  Exports will pick up in the second half of the fiscal year
through March and capital inflows are enough to finance the
current-account deficit, Chakravarthy Rangarajan, chairman of
the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, said separately
in New Delhi. The rupee is expected to stay at current levels
for the rest of the fiscal year, he said.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.33 per
dollar, compared with 55.73 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.21 versus 55.70. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
