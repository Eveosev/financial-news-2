Natural gas futures in  New York 
tumbled the most in five weeks on forecasts of moderating
temperatures that may reduce demand for the power-plant fuel.  Gas fell as much as 9 percent, the biggest intraday drop in
more than three years, after Commodity Weather Group LLC said
cold weather in most of the U.S. this week would give way to
above-normal temperatures from Jan. 7 through Jan. 11. The low
in New York on Jan. 10 may be 37 degrees Fahrenheit (3 Celsius),
10 higher than usual,  AccuWeather Inc.  said.  “We’re going to see some warm weather across the primary
gas-consuming regions,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “As we get
into the new year without signs of sustained cold weather, the
fundamental picture is going to force us lower.”  Natural gas for February delivery fell 11.8 cents, or 3.5
percent, to settle at $3.233 per million British thermal units
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . On a settlement basis, the
drop was the biggest since Nov. 26. The intraday percentage
decline was the most since Sept. 11, 2009. The futures have
risen 8.2 percent from a year ago.  Trading volume was 297,874 contracts at 3:19 p.m., 3.8
percent below the 100-day average.  February $3.10 puts were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 3 cents higher at 6.6 cents on
volume of 1,270 contracts as of 3:16 p.m. Puts accounted for 53
percent of options volume.  Gas slid to $3.05 in electronic trading, the lowest price
since Sept. 26, before rebounding. A 900-contract sell order at
7:52 p.m. yesterday caused the “scary” drop, Drew Wozniak,
vice president of market research and analysis at ICAP Energy
LLC in Louisville,  Kentucky , said in a note to clients today.  Overnight Trade  “There were no errors and all trades stand,” Damon Leavell, a spokesman for Nymex owner CME Group Inc. in New York,
said in an e-mail.  Futures have plummeted 18 percent since rising to a one-
year intraday high of $3.933 on Nov. 23 on below-average weekly
stockpile declines caused by mild weather.  “That drop in overnight trading spooked the market,” said
Teri Viswanath, director of commodities strategy at BNP Paribas
SA in New York. “The warm-up in the forecasts wasn’t that
significant.”  The year 2012 will probably overtake 1998 to become the
warmest on record in the U.S., according to the  National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration . The first 11 months were the
warmest start to any year in the contiguous states since the
nation began keeping records in 1895, NOAA’s  Climatic Data
Center  said Dec. 6.  Stockpile Record  U.S.  gas inventories  totaled 3.652 trillion cubic feet in
the week ended Dec. 21, a record for this time of the year, a
department report last week showed. Supplies were 12.8 percent
above the five-year average, up from 4.6 percent at the end of
November. The  surplus  had climbed to 61 percent at the end of
March. Stockpiles reached an all-time high of 3.929 trillion
cubic feet during the week ended Nov. 2.  The U.S. raised its forecast for natural gas output in 2012
by 0.6 percent in a report Dec. 11.  Marketed gas production averaged 69.22 billion cubic feet a
day, up from 68.84 billion estimated in November, the Energy
Department said in its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook . Output
may increase 0.5 percent in 2013 to 69.59 billion a day,
department estimates show.  Gas prices  at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $2.78 per million British thermal units, compared
with the previous estimate of $2.77, according to the report
from the department’s Energy Information Administration.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first nine months of the year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
