Turkish  real estate  investment trusts
slumped after the government raised value-added taxes on sales
of new homes.  Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi AS (EKGYO)  led declines
on the Istanbul Stock Exchange National  Reits Index (XGMYO) , dropping
2.6 percent to 3.04 liras at 3:20 p.m. in Istanbul. The index
dropped 1.5 percent, the only of 21 Turkey industry gauges
tracked by Bloomberg to fall on the day. The Istanbul Stock
Exchange  National 100 (XU100)  added 1.1 percent to 79,050.82, a record
high on a closing basis.  The new legislation raises taxes on sales of homes with
appraisal values of less than 1,000 liras ($560) per square
meter to 8 percent from 1 percent and for homes appraised at
more than that to 18 percent. That replaces a size-based tax in
which homes larger than 150 square meters were taxed at 18
percent while smaller homes were taxed at 1 percent. The taxes
apply to construction permits issued from this year.  “Overall this is bad news for the sector,” Selim Cakir,
an analyst at  Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK)  in Istanbul, said in an e-
mailed report today. “New projects will be impacted
negatively.”  Sinpas Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi AS (SNGYO)  fell 3.6 percent to
1.36 liras.  Torunlar Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi AS (TRGYO)  fell 0.9
percent to 3.19 liras.  Alarko Gayrimenkul Ortakligi AS (ALGYO)  dropped
1.5 percent to 22.45 liras.  The Reits Index gained 38 percent last year, compared with
a 53 percent increase on the main stock measure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
