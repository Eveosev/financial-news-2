SAC Capital Advisors LP and its
founder, Steven A. Cohen, were sued by a group of  Elan Corp. (ELN) 
investors who claimed losses as a result of alleged illegal
insider trading by SAC in the drugmaker’s stock.  Six investors who held American depositary receipts in
Dublin-based Elan sued in  Manhattan  federal court Dec. 21. They
are seeking to represent a class of investors who bought Elan
ADRs or traded in options from July 21 to July 29, 2008.  Prosecutors have charged Mathew Martoma, a former SAC
portfolio manager, with using illegal tips to help the firm make
profits or avoid losses totaling $276 million by trading in Elan
and Wyeth LLC.  An indictment filed against Martoma Dec. 21 claims he used
tips from a physician who was in charge of monitoring the safety
of a drug undergoing clinical tests to advise an unnamed “hedge
fund owner” to trade in Elan and Wyeth stock. A person familiar
with the case said  Steven A. Cohen , SAC’s founder, is the hedge
fund owner referred to by prosecutors.  Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for  Stamford , Connecticut-
based SAC, declined to comment on the lawsuit. He has said SAC
and Cohen acted appropriately in connection with the Elan and
Wyeth trades.  The investors are represented by the New York law firm Wohl
& Fruchter LLP. In addition to SAC and Cohen, the complaint
names as defendants two SAC units, Martoma and Sidney Gilman,
the doctor who allegedly passed the drug-trial information.  The case is Kaplan v. SAC Capital, 12-CV-9350, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
