Brent oil’s premium to Middle East
marker Dubai crude rose for a fifth day to highest level in more
than two weeks.  The February Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European crude’s premium to Middle East oil, advanced 3
cents to $5.15 a barrel, the highest since Dec. 14, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based broker. The
March EFS lost 4 cents to $4.33.  West African crude priced against Brent becomes more
expensive compared with Middle East oil priced relative to Dubai
as the EFS widens, making shipments of the grades to  Asia  less
attractive for refiners and traders.  PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-owned oil company,
purchased 1.9 million barrels of West African crude for March
delivery, said a company official.  The company bought two 950,000 barrel cargoes of  Nigeria ’s
Qua Iboe crude, said the official who asked not to be named
because he isn’t authorized to speak to the media.  That was Pertamina’s second tender for March. It earlier
bought 950,000 barrels each of Qua Iboe and  Libya ’s Amna crude,
as well as 650,000 barrels of Azeri Light oil, the official said
Dec. 21.  Petroliam Nasional Bhd., known as Petronas, set the
official selling price of its Tapis Blend crude grade at $114.35
a barrel for December, up from $113.21 in November, the
Malaysian state-owned company said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Mideast Crude  Asia-Pacific  refining margins , or the profit from
processing Dubai crude into fuels such as diesel and gasoline
priced in the regional oil-trading hub of Singapore, averaged
$3.39 a barrel during the last five days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 30-day average was $2.74.  Dubai crude’s backwardation, when near-term shipments cost
 more  than future deliveries, rose 5 cents a barrel. Spot prices
were $2.02 higher than cargoes for two months later, according
to PVM data.  Abu Dhabi’s Murban and Upper Zakum were unchanged at
discounts of 50 cents and 5 cents a barrel, respectively, to
their official selling prices, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Qatar Land remained at 60 cents below its OSP while
Qatar Marine was at a 13 cent premium.  Oman futures for March delivery settled $1.34 higher at
$107.50 a barrel at 12:30 p.m. on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange.  No Dubai partial cargoes were traded today, according to a
survey of people who monitor the Platts pricing window.  To contact the reporter on this story:
