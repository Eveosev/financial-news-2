ordered to ban alcohol consumption during official visits to
their subordinates, the People’s Liberation Army Daily said in a
commentary titled  Not Drinking Won’t Hurt Feelings .  The order is in line with the so-called 10 Regulations on
Work Style ordered by the Central Military Commission, said the
commentary, which was also posted on the website of the Ministry

decision to drink or not is a test of the effort to improve
practices by officials at all levels, the commentary said.  High-ranking military officials must begin observing a new
set of rules, including banning receptions that feature luxury
banquets and welcome banners, Xinhua News Agency reported Dec.
