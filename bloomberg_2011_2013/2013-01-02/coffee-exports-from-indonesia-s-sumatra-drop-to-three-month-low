Coffee shipments from  Indonesia ’s
southern Sumatra, the main growing region in the world’s third-
largest robusta producer, fell in December to the lowest level
in three months as farmers held back sales because of low prices.  Exports from Lampung, Bengkulu and South Sumatra provinces
declined 36 percent to 19,071 metric tons from 29,851 tons in
November, data from Lampung’s trade and industry office showed
today. Sales were 18,488 tons in September and 8,698 tons in
December 2011.  Falling supplies from Indonesia may curb a 15 percent slump
in prices from an eight-month high in May. Futures of the
bitter-tasting robusta variety used in instant drinks and
espressos have dropped in London as global supplies increased.
Farmers worldwide will gather 56 million 60-kilogram bags in the
2012-2013, up from 53.3 million bags a year earlier, the
International Coffee Organization estimates.  “Exporters were holding back on shipments waiting for
higher prices,” said Mochtar Luthfie, head of research and
development at the Lampung branch of the Association of
Indonesian Coffee Exporters and Industry. There are still about
50,000 tons of beans in warehouses in Lampung, he said.  Shipments from the three provinces, representing about 75
percent of Indonesia’s output, rose 2.5 percent in 2012 from a
year earlier to 202,532 tons, according to Bloomberg calculation.
Exports, which include robusta beans and instant coffee, were
shipped from Panjang port in Lampung.  Total production across the country may rise to 763,000
tons this year from an estimated 657,138 tons in 2012, according 
to a Dec. 26 forecast by the agriculture ministry.  Robusta settled at $1,924 a ton on the NYSE Liffe in  London 
on Dec. 31. Futures rose to $2,269 a ton in May, the highest
level since September 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
