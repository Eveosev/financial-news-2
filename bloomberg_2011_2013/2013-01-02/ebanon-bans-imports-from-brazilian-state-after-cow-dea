Lebanon banned  meat imports  from the
Brazilian state of Parana after a cow was reportedly infected
with a precursor of mad cow disease.  The Lebanese ban adds to restrictions imposed by countries
including China, Saudi Arabia, Jordan,  South Africa ,  South Korea 
and Japan, Tatiana Prazeres, Brazil’s foreign trade secretary,
told reporters in Brasilia today.  “We do not discard the possibility of questioning the meat
import bans before the  World Trade Organization ,” Prazeres
said. “We will prove that there’s no sanitation reason for the
bans.”  Brazil is the world’s biggest meat exporter, according to
the country’s  Agriculture Ministry . The ministry said Dec. 7
that tests on a 13-year-old cow that died in Parana in 2010
showed it carried the “causing agent of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy,” or mad cow disease. The animal didn’t develop
the disease, nor did the agent cause its death, according to the
ministry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
