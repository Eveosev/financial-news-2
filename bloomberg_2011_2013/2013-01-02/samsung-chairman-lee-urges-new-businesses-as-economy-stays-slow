Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  Chairman Lee Kun Hee urged employees to develop new businesses that can help
the world’s largest maker of mobile phones and TVs fend off a
slow global economy and increased competition.  “There’s an ongoing competition by global companies across
all areas from products, technology development and hiring
talented people to patent disputes,” Lee said, according to a
summary of a speech he gave to employees today. “The market is
big and opportunities are wide open, so we should find out new
businesses that Samsung’s future will hinge on.”  Samsung Group, which runs 82 affiliate companies and
generates about 20 percent of  South Korea ’s gross domestic
product, should boost investment and create new jobs, Lee said,
according to the summary distributed by  Samsung Group  via e-
mail.  The group’s flagship electronics unit, Suwon-based Samsung
Electronics, is the world’s biggest seller of mobile phones,
TVs, memory chips and flat-panel displays. Samsung shipped about
one in every four handsets in the third quarter, according to
researcher IDC, and it sells one in every four flat-panel TVs,
according to data from  DisplaySearch .  Asia ’s biggest consumer-electronics  company  posted a record
165 trillion won ($155 billion) in revenue in 2011. That is
forecast to increase to 201.2 trillion won, according to the
average of 43 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company will release its fourth-quarter earnings
estimates early next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
