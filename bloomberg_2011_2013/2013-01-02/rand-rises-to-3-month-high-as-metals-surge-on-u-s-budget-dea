South African bonds gained for the
first time in six days after a U.S. budget deal that averted
spending cuts and tax increases in the world’s biggest economy
boosted demand for riskier assets. The rand retreated from a
three-month high.  Yields on 10.5 percent bonds due in December 2026 dropped
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.24 percent as
of 3:45 p.m. in Johannesburg. The rand slipped 0.2 percent to
8.4767 per dollar after gaining as much as 0.6 percent in
earlier trading to the strongest level since Oct. 4.  Copper and nickel led a rally in metal prices after the
 House of Representatives  voted in favor of the Senate’s budget
legislation as Republican lawmakers abandoned efforts to add
spending cuts to the bill, removing one impediment to a recovery
in the  U.S. economy . Gold climbed to a two-week high. Metals and
other commodities account for 45 percent of  South Africa ’s
exports, according to government data.  “For now, the mood is more upbeat and this is reflected in
risk assets generally,” Quinten Bertenshaw, a Johannesburg-
based analyst at ETM Analytics, said in e-mailed comments. “The
rand is not benefitting from the risk-on trade given the extent
of its gains in the prior month.”  South Africa’s currency has strengthened 5 percent against
the dollar in the past month, the best performance out of 25
emerging-market currencies monitored by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
