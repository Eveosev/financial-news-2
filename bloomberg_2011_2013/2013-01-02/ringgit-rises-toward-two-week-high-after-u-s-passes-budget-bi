Malaysia’s ringgit rose to an 11-week
high after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill
undoing income-tax increases for more than 99 percent of U.S.
households, boosting appetite for riskier assets.  The 257-167 bipartisan vote breaks a yearlong impasse on
averting the so-called fiscal cliff of $600 billion in automatic
tax increases and spending cuts that were set to take effect
yesterday. Foreign ownership of Malaysian bonds rose 2 percent
to a record 226.3 billion ringgit ($74.5 billion) in November
from October, according to a Dec. 31 central bank report.
Government notes advanced.  “The resolution of the fiscal cliff issue is positive for
the market,” said Choong Yin Pheng, senior manager for fixed
income and economic research at  Hong Leong Bank Bhd. (HLBK)  in  Kuala
Lumpur . “Malaysia is one of the more preferred investment
destinations in the region.”  The ringgit climbed 0.6 percent, the most since Oct. 25, to
3.0372 per dollar from Dec. 31 as of 4:00 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Malaysian financial
markets were shut yesterday for the New Year’s holiday. The
currency touched 3.0345, which was the strongest since Oct. 18.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, rose 16 basis points, or
0.16 percentage point, to 4.98 percent.  The ringgit’s strength was also driven by buying of
 government bonds  at the start of the new year, said Ahmad
Zubaidi Samse, a foreign-exchange trader at Bank Muamalat
Malaysia Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.  The yield on the 3.314 percent government notes due October
2017 fell five basis points to 3.20 percent, the lowest level
since Nov. 27, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
