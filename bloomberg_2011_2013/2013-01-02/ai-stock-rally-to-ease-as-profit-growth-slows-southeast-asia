Thailand’s benchmark  stock  index, the
best performer among Asia’s major equity markets in 2012, will
gain at less than half last year’s pace as corporate earnings
growth slows, according to BBL Asset Management Co.  Stocks will offer returns close to companies’ average
earnings growth of 15 percent in 2013, said Voravan Tarapoom,
chief executive officer at the fund, which oversees about $7.5
billion of assets. The firm manages the  BBL Bualuang Top-Ten
Fund (BTP) , which rallied 76 percent last year, making it the best
performer among 196 equity funds based in Thailand, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Investors should expect much lower returns from Thai
equities this year to reflect companies’ earnings,” Voravan
said, declining to give a specific forecast for the index. “The
market will remain volatile” because of concern that global
economic growth may falter and the “excessive valuations” for
some stocks, she said.  The SET Index gained 36 percent in 2012, the most among
Asia’s benchmark indexes after  Pakistan . The government spent
about 283 billion baht ($9.3 billion) buying rice from farmers
at above-market rates and offered at least 91 billion baht in
tax rebates for new car purchases to boost growth after floods
in 2011 cost the economy an estimated 1.4 trillion baht.  The Thai economy may expand about 5 percent this year from
an estimated 5.7 percent in 2012, the finance ministry said on
Dec. 26. Local stocks may extend gains on public spending and a
recovery in exports, Sopawadee Lertmanaschai, secretary-general
of the Government Pension Fund, which manages 572 billion baht
of assets, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Asia Crisis  The SET Index surged 1.1 percent yesterday to 1,407.45, the
highest close since Feb. 7, 1996, the year before  Thailand ’s
decision to devalue the baht plunged the economy into its worst
ever crisis and sparked turmoil throughout Asia. The gauge
climbed 0.2 percent to 1,410.64 as of 10:05 a.m. in Bangkok.  “Valuation is our major concern,” said Daniel Fineman,
Credit Suisse Group AG’s Thailand research head. “We believe
that the market deserves its re-rating on improved politics, but
do not consider current multiples sustainable for some stocks.”  The SET Index was valued at 15.6 times  estimated earnings 
yesterday, the highest level since December 2007, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That compared with a multiple of
12.4 times for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  and 13.4 times
for the  MSCI Asia-Pacific Excluding Japan (MXAPJ)  Index.  Credit Suisse expects the SET Index to reach 1,470 in 2013.
That would be a 5.6 percent advance from the end of 2012 and a
4.4 percent gain from yesterday’s close. Economic growth may
slow this year as the end of flood reconstruction curbs
investment and the expiration of tax incentives cuts vehicle
sales, according to Fineman.  Banks, Tourism  BBL Asset’s Voravan favors utilities, food producers, banks
and transportation companies whose earnings will benefit from
increased domestic consumption and tourism. Shares of companies
that rely on exports may suffer as the global economy struggles
to recover, she said yesterday by e-mail.  An  index  of Thai contractors and property developers was
the biggest gainer among 27 industry groups in the benchmark
index, surging 79 percent in 2012. Any delay in government
flood-prevention projects may curb gains for contractors and
cement producers in 2013, according to Credit Suisse’s Fineman.
His top picks are banks, property and health-care companies.  Sino-Thai Engineering & Construction Pcl (STEC) , the nation’s
biggest construction company by market value, rallied 122
percent in 2012.  Ch. Karnchang Pcl (CK) , the No. 2 contractor, jumped
77 percent.  Siam Cement Pcl (SCC) , the largest cement maker, climbed
41 percent and  Siam City Cement Pcl (SCCC)  advanced 63 percent.  Flood Spending  Overseas investors  bought  a net 76.4 billion baht of Thai
shares in 2012, after an outflow of 5.1 billion baht in the
previous year. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has pledged to
spend more than 2 trillion baht to construct roads, bridges and
drainage systems over the next seven years to boost growth and
protect the country from the effects of floods.  BBL Asset’s estimate for 2013 earnings growth is higher
than the market consensus. Earnings per share for the 497
companies in the SET Index are expected to rise 9.1 percent in
2013, slowing from an estimate of 39 percent growth in 2012,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Trading  turnover  on the Stock Exchange of Thailand averaged
31 billion baht a day in 2012, a 7.3 percent increase from 28.9
billion baht a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The benchmark’s 30-day volatility was at 7.42 on Dec.
28, the lowest since Sept. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
