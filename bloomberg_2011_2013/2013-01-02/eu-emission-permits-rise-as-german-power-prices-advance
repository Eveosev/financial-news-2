European Union carbon-dioxide permits
fell as volumes at the end of trading jumped to the most for a
five-minute period in more than two months.  Allowances for December 2013 dropped as much as 4.2 percent
to 6.39 euros ($8.42) a metric ton, the least in almost a month,
as trading volume on the ICE Futures Europe exchange jumped to
840,000 tons from 4:55 p.m. to 5 p.m. London time. That’s more
than 14 percent of the day’s total and the most for the contract
for any five-minute period since Oct. 31. Carbon settled at 6.57
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
