An Egyptian presidential aide left
for the  United Arab Emirates , where he will deliver a letter
from President Mohamed Mursi, after reports that a number of
Egyptians have been detained there.  Essam el-Haddad, assistant to the president for foreign
affairs and international cooperation, will give Mursi’s letter
to U.A.E. President Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan and meet
officials in Dubai and  Abu Dhabi  during his two-day visit,
according to a statement from the Egyptian presidency.  The visit comes as the Cairo-based Arabic Network for Human
Rights Information denounced what it said on its website were
the arrests of a number of Egyptians living in the U.A.E. They
were detained “allegedly for running a banned organization in
the Emirates” with links to  Egypt ’s  Muslim Brotherhood , the
group said.  “What concerns us is that interrogations be fair and
transparent and that there be proof that the law has been
violated and they are not being punished for ideological
affiliations,” the network’s head, Gamal Eid, said in a phone
interview.  Officials at the Ministry of Interior in the U.A.E. weren’t
immediately available to comment when contacted after working
hours today. The U.A.E. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson
didn’t answer calls or an e-mail today. The Egyptian
presidency’s statement made no mention of the arrests.  To contact the reporters on this story:
