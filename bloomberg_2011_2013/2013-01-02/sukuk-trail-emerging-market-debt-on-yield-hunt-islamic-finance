Islamic bonds trailed emerging-market
debt for a second year as foreign funds chased higher yields, a
trend that Union Investment Privatfonds says is likely to
continue in 2013.  Global Shariah-compliant notes gained 9.6 percent in 2012,
according to the HSBC/Nasdaq Dubai US Dollar Sukuk Index,
compared with 18.5 percent for developing-nation securities,
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Composite Index shows. The
average yield on dollar sukuk dropped 1.18 percentage points to
2.81 percent, while that for  emerging-market  paper fell 1.58
percentage points to 4.50 percent, according to the two gauges.  Developing-nation bond funds extended their inflow streak
to 28 weeks in the period ending Dec. 21, according to
researcher EPFR Global, fueled by monetary easing in the U.S.,
 Japan  and the euro area. Debt from investment-grade Malaysia,
which accounts for 62 percent of outstanding sukuk, returned 11
percent last year, compared with 19 percent for Russia and 17
percent for  Peru , according to JPMorgan indexes.  “This year can be characterized as the hunt-for-yield
year,” Sergey Dergachev, a Frankfurt-based senior portfolio
manager at Union Investment Privatfonds, which oversees $8.5
billion of emerging-market debt, said in a Dec. 27 interview.
“The chance to see this trend continue, where everything that
has yield on it performs well, is very good.”  Higher Sales  Sukuk returns trailed developing-nation bonds by just 1.3
percentage points in 2011, after beating them by 0.8 percentage
point the year before, the HSBC/Nasdaq and JPMorgan gauges show.  The average yield on global Islamic notes reached a record
low of 2.76 percent on Nov. 30, according to the HSBC/Nasdaq
index. The gap between the average yield and the London
interbank offered rate, or Libor, shrunk 91 basis points, or
0.92 percentage point, to 182 basis points in 2012.  Falling yields have helped push worldwide sales of debt
that comply with Islam’s ban on interest to an unprecedented
$46.3 billion in 2012, surpassing last year’s record of $36.7
billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Sales may be even
higher in 2013 as new countries including Oman, Tunisia and
 Egypt  tap the Shariah-compliant  capital market  for the first
time,  CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB)  and OCBC Al-Amin Bank Bhd. said
in December.  Foreign funds boosted their holdings of Malaysian
 government securities  by 29 percent to a record 221.9 billion
ringgit ($73 billion) last year through October, according to
the central bank. Overseas investors increased ownership of
Indonesian sovereign bonds by 21 percent to 270.5 trillion
rupiah ($27.8 billion) in 2012, finance ministry figures show.  Stabilizing Yields  The inflows helped push the yield on Malaysia’ 3.928
percent sukuk due June 2015 down by 1.38 percentage points in
2012 to 1.28 percent, while that for  Indonesia ’s 8.8 percent
Islamic dollar note due April 2014 fell 135 basis points to 1.91
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Stimulus isn’t going to play as big of a role in 2013,”
said Tan Chee Wee, the Kuala Lumpur-based head of fixed-income
research at Maybank Investment Bank Bhd., the third-largest
underwriter of Islamic bonds. “We have already seen a lot of
foreign inflows come into  Malaysia ,” he said in a Dec. 27
interview, adding that he didn’t expect yields to fall much
further this year.  The premium investors demand to hold sukuk issued by Dubai
over Malaysia’s investment-grade Islamic bonds narrowed to a
record low of 75 basis points on Dec. 27, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The yield on the emirate’s securities, which are
not rated by any of the three major companies, dropped 3.44
percentage points in 2012 to 2.13 percent.  Qatar, Bahrain  The yield on the 2.099 percent Shariah-complaint notes from
Qatar, another major issuer of Islamic debt, declined 12 basis
points to 1.98 percent since they were issued in July, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield on Bahrain’s 6.247 percent
Islamic securities due June 2014 reached a record-low of 1.77
percent on Dec. 31 and fell 148 basis points in 2012.  “The sovereign universe for sukuk investors consists
primarily of stable but also lower-yielding countries, which
have certainly lagged the performance of higher-yielding
countries in 2012,” said Union Investment’s Dergachev. “The
higher-yielding the credit was, the better it has performed.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
