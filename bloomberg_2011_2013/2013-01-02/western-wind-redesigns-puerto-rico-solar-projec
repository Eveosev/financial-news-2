Western Wind Energy Corp. (WND) , the
renewable-power developer that put itself up for sale in July,
redesigned its 30-megawatt solar project in Puerto Rico as the
company seeks to boost its value.  The Yabucoa project was modified to incorporate new
equipment after a supplier entered financial restructuring,
Vancouver-based Western Wind said in a statement today. The new
design uses different inverters to convert output to alternating
current to be sent to the grid.  The value of the Puerto Rico project isn’t reflected in a
November offer by  Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners LP (BEP-U)  to buy
the company for C$172.6 million ($175 million), Western Wind
President Jeff Ciachurski said in the statement. Western Wind
rejected the offer.  The Brookfield offer also doesn’t account for Congress’s
decision yesterday to extend production tax credits, Ciachurski
said.  Western Wind rose a penny to C$2.81 at the close in
Toronto. It  operates  wind farms in California and a combined
wind-and-solar plant in Arizona.  To contact the reporter on this story:
