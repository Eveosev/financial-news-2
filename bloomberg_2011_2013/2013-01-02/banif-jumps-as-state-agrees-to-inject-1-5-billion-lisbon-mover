Banif SA, the biggest lender in
 Portugal ’s Madeira and Azores islands, surged after the
 Portuguese government  said it would inject 1.1 billion euros
($1.5 billion) into the bank.  The stock climbed 7.5  percent  to close at 15.7 cents in
Lisbon, giving Funchal, Madeira-based Banif a market value of
89.5 million euros. The new shares started trading on Dec. 24
after a merger of the holding company Banif SGPS into Banif was
completed.  The Portuguese state will take part in Banif’s
recapitalization plan by subscribing 700 million euros of
special stock and 400 million euros of capital instruments that
will be issued by the bank by the end of January, the finance
ministry said on Dec. 31. The move will help bolster Banif’s
core Tier 1 capital ratio to more than 10 percent, it said.  “The state’s decision to become a shareholder of Banif is
positive for the bank’s capital ratios and solvency levels,”
said Jose Novo, a trader at Orey iTrade in Lisbon.  Banif will also carry out a 450 million-euro capital
increase that will be subscribed by private investors, according
to the  finance ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
