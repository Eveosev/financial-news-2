Cy Young Award-winning pitcher  David Price  of the Tampa Bay Rays avoided arbitration by agreeing to a
one-year contract with the team, ESPN reported.  Price, who made $4.35 million last season, will make about
$10 million in 2013,  ESPN said , citing a person within Major
League Baseball it didn’t identify.  Price, 27, will be eligible for free agency after the 2015
season. He went 20-5 last year with a 2.56 earned run average to
win the Cy Young Award as the American League’s best pitcher. In
five seasons in the major leagues he’s 61-31 with a 3.16 ERA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
