BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) 
and Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SAA topped the list of mining
companies that won Peruvian exploration concessions last year,
 Gestion  reported.  Peru granted 4,668 mining concessions to 582 companies in
2012, up from 3,100 the previous year, the Lima-based newspaper
said, citing the country’s Ingemmet mining industry association.
BHP got 144 of the licenses, while Buenaventura was granted 100
and Barrick 84, Gestion said.  Officials at the press offices of Buenaventura and Barrick
in Lima didn’t return calls from Bloomberg News seeking comment.
BHP Billiton spokeswoman Emma Meade didn’t immediately reply to
an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
