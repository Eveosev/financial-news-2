Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) , the
second-largest maker of processors for personal computers, said
Devinder Kumar will become chief financial officer.  Kumar, 57, who has filled the role on an interim basis
since Thomas Seifert departed in September, was chosen after a
“thorough internal and external search,” the company said
today in a statement. Kumar has been controller since 2001. His
appointment is effective today.  Seifert’s resignation in late September left the company
without a finance chief amid a struggle to claw back market
share lost to larger competitor  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and to stem losses
that some analysts have fretted will leave it short of cash.  Kumar, a veteran of Sunnyvale, California-based AMD for
more than 28 years, has a bachelor’s degree from the University
of Malaya, Malaysia, a master’s degree from the  University of
California , Santa Barbara, and a master’s degree in business
administration from the University of California, Los Angeles.  AMD  shares  rose 5.4 percent to $2.53 at the close in New
York, before the announcement. They  lost  56 percent of their
value last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
