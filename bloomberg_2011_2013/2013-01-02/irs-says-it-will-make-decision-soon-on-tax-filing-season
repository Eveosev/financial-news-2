The  Internal Revenue Service  is
reviewing the tax legislation passed by the U.S. Congress
yesterday and will make a decision soon about when taxpayers can
start filing 2012 returns, the agency said in a statement.  The filing season, scheduled to start this month, had been
in question because several provisions affecting 2012 tax
returns hadnâ€™t been addressed. President  Barack Obama  has said
he will sign the bill completing those provisions.  The IRS had said earlier that without congressional action,
as many as two-thirds of taxpayers might have had to  wait until
late March to file.  In the statement, the IRS said it will make information
available soon about paycheck withholding to reflect the new tax
rates that will be in place for 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
