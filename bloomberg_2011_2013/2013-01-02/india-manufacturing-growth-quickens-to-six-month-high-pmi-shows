Indian manufacturing expanded at the
fastest pace in six months in December, a private survey showed,
after the government overhauled policies to revive Asia’s third-
largest economy.  The purchasing managers’ index rose to 54.7 from 53.7 in
November, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said in a
statement today. A number above 50 indicates growth.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government has stepped up
efforts since September to lure more foreign investment, pare a
budget deficit and spur exports. The central bank has signaled
it may ease monetary policy in coming months as inflation cools,
to boost an economy that the Finance Ministry predicts will
 expand  at the weakest pace in a decade this fiscal year.  “We are seeing green shoots of recovery,” Brinda Jagirdar,
an economist at  State Bank  of India in Mumbai, said before the
release. “There is a turnaround, but it is not strong since it
is coming after a severe and widespread slowdown.”  The rupee strengthened 0.4 percent to 54.475 per dollar as
of 10:33 a.m. in Mumbai. The BSE India Sensitive Index of stocks
climbed 0.6 percent, while the yield on the 8.15 percent bonds
due June 2022 was little changed at 7.99 percent.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has left its benchmark  interest
rate  unchanged at 8 percent since a 50 basis-point cut in April
last year. The Finance Ministry forecasts a 5.7 percent to 5.9
percent climb in gross domestic product in the 12 months ending
March 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
