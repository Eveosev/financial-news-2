Brazil ’s  trade surplus  narrowed to a
10-year low in 2012 as a weaker currency failed to offset the
effects of the world economic slowdown.  Brazil posted a $19.4 billion  trade surplus  last year, the
lowest since the $13.2 billion registered in 2002 and a 35
percent drop from the $29.8 billion surplus in 2011, according
to the Trade Ministry website. In December, the surplus was
$2.25 billion, compared with a median forecast for a $1.6
billion surplus from 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s government has imposed taxes on
foreign inflows and the  derivatives market  and sold dollars in
the spot, forward and futures market to weaken the real, in a
bid to boost exports and protect domestic industry from cheaper
imports. The currency declined 9 percent last year against the
dollar, the second-biggest loss among the 16 most-traded
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Faltering economic growth worldwide slowed Brazilian sales
abroad to $242.6 billion in 2012, down from $256 billion the
year before. That resulted in a 5.3 percent drop in average
daily exports from 2011, according to the Trade Ministry.
Imports totaled $223.1 billion in 2012, down from $226.2 billion
the year before, an average daily drop of 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
