MRV Engenharia (MRVE3)  & Participacoes SA
fell to a two-week low after  Brazil ’s government added the
homebuilder to a list of companies it says keeps workers in
degrading or slave-like conditions.  Shares declined 3.8 percent to 11.52 reais at 3:01 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo  after earlier dropping to 11.41 reais, the lowest
intraday price since Dec. 17. It was the worst performance on
the benchmark Bovespa index, which rose 2.7 percent.  State-controlled lender Caixa Economica Federal suspended
MRV’s access to government financing after it was included on
the Labor Ministry’s semi-annual list released today. All of the
company’s new projects in the third quarter were part of the
federal government’s “Minha Casa, Minha Vida” low-income
housing program, according to a Nov. 8 regulatory filing.  Inspections at apartment construction sites in the city of
Curitiba in 2011 found that MRV, Brazil’s second-largest
homebuilder by market capitalization, hired workers without
registering their employment with the government and failed to
keep their accommodations clean or provide an appropriate place
for meals, according to a Labor Ministry statement.  The homebuilder, based in  Belo Horizonte , Brazil, is taking
measures to be removed from the list, the company said today in
a regulatory filing, without providing further details. A press
officer who asked not to be named in accordance with company
policy said MRV will not comment further on the issue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
