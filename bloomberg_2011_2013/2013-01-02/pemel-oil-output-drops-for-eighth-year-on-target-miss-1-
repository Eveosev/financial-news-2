Petroleos Mexicanos , the world’s
fourth-largest oil producer, fell short of its 2012 output
target of more than 2.55 million barrels a day as production
declined for the eighth consecutive year.  Pemex, as the state-owned company is known, pumped an
average of 2.549 million barrels a day in 2012, according to a
preliminary weekly report on the company’s website today.
Production has fallen each year since 2004, when Pemex’s output
was 3.38 million barrels a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Pemex expected to increase output as new wells came online,
then-Chief Executive Officer  Juan Jose Suarez Coppel  said July
20. The Mexico City-based producer pumped 2.55 million barrels a
day in 2011.  In November, Pemex produced the most crude in almost two
years with a daily average of 2.577 million barrels. Production
in December remained at the same level.  CEO Emilio Lozoya took over Dec. 1, after the arrival of
Mexico’s new president Enrique Pena Nieto and his cabinet.  Saudi Aramco , the National Iranian Oil Co. and  Petroleos de
Venezuela  are the world’s three largest producers of crude oil,
according to date compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
