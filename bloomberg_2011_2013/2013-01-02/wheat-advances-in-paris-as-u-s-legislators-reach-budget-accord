Wheat rose in Paris as commodities
gained amid speculation demand will improve after U.S. lawmakers
reached an accord to avert the so-called fiscal cliff of
spending cuts and tax increases.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
touched the highest level since Dec. 3 and the dollar slid after
the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill preventing
income taxes from rising for most workers in the country. The
U.S. is the world’s biggest wheat exporter and fourth-largest
consumer of the grain, after  China , the European Union and
 India , as well as the leading shipper of corn and soybeans.  “The markets have been jumping up and down quite a lot
lately, mostly on fiscal-cliff concerns,” Leo von Kameke, a
Bartlow, England-based analyst at Offre et  Demande Agricole ,
said in a telephone interview. Prices were supported today
because “the biggest economy in the world is not necessarily
going into a recession now, so it seems they’ve fixed the
problem for the short term.”  Milling wheat for delivery in March climbed 1.5 percent to
252.50 euros ($335.19) a metric ton at 1:44 p.m. on NYSE Liffe
in Paris. Prices rose 27 percent in 2012 as drought cut grain
supplies from the U.S. to  Russia . Agricultural trading was
closed yesterday for New Year’s Day. Grain and oilseed markets
on the Chicago Board of Trade are scheduled to reopen at 9:30
a.m. local time today.  Rapeseed for delivery in February advanced 1 percent to 461
euros a ton in Paris, extending last year’s 4.1 percent
increase. Corn for delivery in March added 1 percent to 241.25
euros a ton. Feed wheat for delivery in May rose 0.8 percent to
211.85 pounds ($345.36) a ton on NYSE Liffe in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
