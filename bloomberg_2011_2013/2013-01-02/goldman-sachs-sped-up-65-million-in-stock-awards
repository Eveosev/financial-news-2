Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  accelerated
delivery of $65 million in stock awards to 10 executives,
including Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, helping
them avoid higher tax rates that take effect this year.  The awards are restricted stock granted for years prior to
2012, according to 10 separate  filings  made public at about 8
p.m.  New York  time on Dec. 31. Each executive surrendered 45
percent to 50 percent of their awards in order to pay taxes,
according to the filings. The firm’s stock climbed 41 percent in
2012, its first annual gain since 2009.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest  U.S. bank  by assets,
typically delivers executives’ restricted stock during January.
The decision to speed up the delivery came as the  U.S. Congress 
debated and ultimately passed a bill that would increase tax
rates on  capital gains  and on individuals who make taxable
income of $400,000 or more.  “The December delivery of shares went to a wider group of
employees than the named executive officers” who were included
in the filings, said  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for the New
York-based firm. He declined to comment on the reason for the
accelerated delivery or on which other employees received stock
early.  Blankfein, 58, has said he would be willing to pay higher
taxes if they were part of a fiscal compromise to reduce the
 budget deficit . Today he praised the bill that passed the  House
of Representatives  yesterday.  ‘Step Forward’  “This agreement is a step forward to injecting growth and
investor confidence into the  U.S. economy ,” he said in an e-
mailed statement. “While more progress clearly will be needed,
particularly in regards to restraining the growth in  government
spending , this measure lays the foundation for more economic
growth.”  Blankfein received 66,065 shares of restricted stock on
Dec. 31, worth $8.43 million at the closing share  price  that
day, according to a company filing. The filing shows that he
sold 33,245 shares for $126.24 apiece, although a footnote
explains that those shares were in fact retained by the company
“to satisfy withholding obligations.”  Changing Landscape  One of Goldman Sachs’s Wall Street rivals took a different
approach to the changing tax landscape.  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) ,
the investment bank that agreed in November to sell itself to
its biggest owner,  Leucadia National Corp. (LUK) , accelerated the
delivery of  dividends  to all shareholders, including executives,
on Dec. 31, according to company filings.  “We expedited the regular dividend payment for all
Jefferies shareholders in anticipation of increased rates,” the
New York-based firm said in a statement. “Our top executives
were treated identically to every other shareholder.”  Some of the executives’ dividends were awarded as deferred
stock, according to the filings. Those shares “will be taxed at
the higher rates when they ultimately vest,” the company said.
Jefferies CEO  Richard Handler , 51, received 36,872 deferred
shares at $18.57 each, worth $684,713.  Brian Friedman , 57,
chairman of Jefferies’s executive committee, got 9,321 shares at
that price, valued at $173,091.  Gary D. Cohn, 52, Goldman Sachs’s president and chief
operating officer, and David A. Viniar, 57, the firm’s chief
financial officer, received the same number of shares as
Blankfein and had the same amount withheld, according to
filings.  Surrendered Shares  The other executives who received and surrendered shares
for withholding purposes were Vice Chairmen John S. Weinberg,
55, and J. Michael Evans, 55; Edith Cooper, the 51-year-old head
of human  capital management ; John F.W. Rogers, the firm’s 56-
year-old chief of staff; General Counsel Gregory K. Palm, 64;
 Global Head  of Compliance Alan M. Cohen, 62; and Chief
Accounting Officer Sarah Smith.  Goldman Sachs is required to file disclosures of changes in
stock ownership by its 12 executive officers. The firm made no
disclosures of stock activity on Dec. 31 by Vice Chairman
Michael S. Sherwood, a 47-year-old British citizen based in
 London , or by  Mark Schwartz , the Hong Kong-based head of the
firm’s Asian business. Schwartz, a 58-year-old U.S. citizen,
rejoined the firm in June after 11 years away.  Below is a table of stock delivered to each of the Goldman
Sachs executives and the amount surrendered for withholding
purposes, according to company filings.  *T Executive           Stock Delivered     Stock Surrendered  for Withholding  Lloyd C. Blankfein      66,065              33,245
