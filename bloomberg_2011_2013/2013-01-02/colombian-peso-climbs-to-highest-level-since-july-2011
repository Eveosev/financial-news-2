Colombia ’s peso, the third-biggest
gainer in 2012 among the world’s currencies, touched a 17-month
high after U.S. lawmakers passed a bill averting tax increases
that had threatened the economic recovery.  The currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 1,763.50 per
dollar. Earlier it touched 1,750.50, the strongest level since
July 2011. The peso rallied 9.7 percent in 2012, the most after
the Polish zloty and Hungarian forint among 171 dollar
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  “Investors are euphoric,” Marisol Torres, an analyst at
Bogota-based  Helm Bank SA (PFBHELMB) , said in a phone interview. Stocks and
commodities surged globally after the U.S. accord.  The peso rallied in 2012 as army victories over guerrillas
opened up swaths of the countryside to mining and oil
production. Colombia’s central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe said
on RCN Radio today that the strong peso is a concern and
reiterated that Banco de la Republica will buy at least $20
million a day through at least the first quarter. Policy makers
will double daily purchases to a minimum of $40 million should
the currency extends its increase, Torres said.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated
securities due in July 2024 was little changed at 5.66 percent,
according to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
