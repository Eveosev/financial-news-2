Braskem SA (BRKM5) , Latin America’s largest
petrochemicals maker,  rose  the most since August after it sold
Brazilian assets for a total of 652 million reais ($319.6
million).  The stock climbed 5.6 percent to 13.52 reais at 11:31 a.m.
in  Sao Paulo . Earlier the stock advanced the most since Aug. 16.  Braskem sold Distribuidora de Aguas Camacari SA, a water
treatment unit, and a 54.2 percent stake in Cetrel SA, a company
responsible for treating industrial waste at the Camacari
petrochemical complex, the Sao Paulo-based company said Dec. 28.
Odebrecht SA, which holds a 38.1 percent stake in Braskem,
bought the unit and the Cetrel stake, it said.  The company’s net debt was 13.18 billion reais in the third
quarter, up from 10.76 billion reais in the year earlier period,
Braskem said Nov. 8. The company’s rating outlook was changed to
negative by Moody’s Investors Services on Nov. 28 on concern
that higher  oil prices  would hurt margin profitability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
