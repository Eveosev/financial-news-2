Russia ’s crude oil and condensate
 output  in 2012 climbed 1.1 percent from a year ago to a post-
Soviet record as companies maximized supply to take advantage of
an increase in prices.  Russia, the world’s biggest energy producer, pumped 10.38
million barrels a day last year, up from 10.27 million in the
previous year, according to data from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-
TEK unit. Daily oil output was 10.485 million barrels in
December, little changed compared with revised data from
November and up 1.6 percent from the same period in 2011, the
agency said in an e-mail today.  Russia’s government is reviewing the export duty structure,
with plans to propose incentives for offshore and unconventional
oil production by the end of the first quarter. President
 Vladimir Putin  has set a goal of maintaining output at more than
10 million barrels a day. The country pumped above that level in
September 2009 for the first time since the collapse of the
 Soviet Union .  Oil exports declined to 5.14 million barrels a day last
month, a 0.3 percent decrease from November and 1.8 percent less
than in December 2011.  Brent oil on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange,
a benchmark for more than half of the world’s supply, averaged a
record $111.68 a barrel last year, up 0.7 percent from 2011.  Russia’s annual natural-gas production in 2012 was 655
billion cubic meters, down 2.3 percent from 2011, according to
the data. December output rose 4.1 percent compared to a year
earlier, to 65.8 billion cubic meters.  Soviet-era crude and condensate output in Russia peaked at
11.4 million barrels a day in 1987, BP Plc  data  show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
