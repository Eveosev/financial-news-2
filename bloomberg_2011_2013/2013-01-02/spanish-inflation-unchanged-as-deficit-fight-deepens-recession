Spanish inflation remained unchanged
in December as the recession in the euro region’s fourth-largest
economy deepened.  Consumer prices , based on European Union calculations, rose
3 percent from a year earlier, the National Statistics Institute
in Madrid said today. That matched the median of 17 estimates in
a Bloomberg News survey.  Spain ’s national inflation measure
showed a 2.9 percent rise.  The Spanish  economy  probably contracted for a sixth
straight quarter at the end of last year as Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  implemented austerity measures to reduce the euro-
area’s second largest  budget deficit . The government expects to
miss its target set by the European Union again this year.  The Brussels-based European Commission suspended its
budget-cut prescriptions for Spain in November after the 17-
nation euro area fell into a recession. The  European Central
Bank  lowered its economic forecasts last month, predicting a
contraction of 0.3 percent this year.  Several tax increases since Rajoy assumed power a year ago
have contributed to prices rising even as the second recession
since 2008 left over a quarter of the workforce jobless.
Stripping out their impact, inflation was 0.9 percent in
November,  according  to the Spanish statistics institute, and 0.3
percent if fresh food and energy were also excluded. The
equivalent measure for December will be published on Jan. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
