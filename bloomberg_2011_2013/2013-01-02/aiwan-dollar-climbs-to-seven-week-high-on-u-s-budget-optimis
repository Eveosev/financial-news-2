Taiwan’s dollar rose to a seven-week
high after the  U.S. Senate  passed a budget bill that may avert
$600 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts if
approved by the House.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index of regional shares rallied 0.6
percent, signaling demand for riskier assets rose. Oklahoma
Representative Tom Cole said he expects the House to pass the
Senate’s plan unchanged with a “substantial” bipartisan vote.
 South Korea ’s exports unexpectedly dropped 5.5 percent in
December from a year earlier, official data showed yesterday.  “Passing the bill will avoid the drastic impact a fiscal
cliff would have on the global economy,” said  Frances Cheung , a
Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “The
disappointing Korea data shows  Asia ’s economic outlook remains
uncertain. The central bank will probably try to maintain the
relative competitiveness of the Taiwan dollar.”  The Taiwan dollar gained 0.4 percent to NT$29.014 against
its U.S. counterpart as of 9:46 a.m. local time, according to
data from Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$29.005 earlier, the
strongest level since Nov. 13.  The currency strengthened 4 percent in 2012 as overseas
investors boosted their holdings of the island’s stocks by $4.9
billion, according to exchange data. The  Taiwan dollar  will drop
to NT$29.2 by the end of March, Cheung predicts.  The monetary authority has bought the greenback to counter
gains in the island’s currency on most days in the past nine
months, according to traders who asked not to be identified. The
central bank’s mandate is to keep relative exchange-rate
stability and to intervene in the event of abnormal moves,
Governor Perng Fai-Nan said on Dec. 19.  Volatility Eases  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a gauge
of expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, fell
11 basis points to 3.15 percent.  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due September 2022
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.158
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The  overnight interbank lending  was little changed at 0.413
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
