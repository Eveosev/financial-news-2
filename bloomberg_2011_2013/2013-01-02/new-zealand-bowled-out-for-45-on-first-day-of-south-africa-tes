Vernon Philander took five wickets as
 New Zealand  collapsed to 45 all out in the first cricket Test
against South Africa. Alviro Petersen made an unbeaten 103 as
his team built a 207-run lead after the opening day.  Top-ranked South Africa ended New Zealand’s innings inside
20 overs in Cape Town. Philander claimed a career-best 5-7 in
six overs as the tourists stumbled to their third-lowest Test
total.  Only Kane Williamson, on 13, reached double figures as
Morne Morkel got three wickets and  Dale Steyn  claimed his 300th
Test victim, ending on 2-18.  The home team finished the day on 252-3. Hashim Amla scored
66 and Jacques Kallis 60 after captain Graeme Smith was out for
1. AB de Villiers has 19.  The teams are playing a two-match series, and New Zealand’s
first under new captain Brendon McCullum. McCullum, who replaced
 Ross Taylor  before the start of the series, elected to bat after
winning the toss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
