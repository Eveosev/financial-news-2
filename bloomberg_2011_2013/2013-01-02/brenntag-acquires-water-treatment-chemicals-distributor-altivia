Brenntag AG (BNR) , a German chemical-
distributor, said today that it acquired the U.S. water-
treatment chemicals distributor Altivia Corp. in a $125 million
deal to expand in the water additives business.  The purchase of the Houston-based water-treatment chemical
distributor didn’t include Altivia Chemicals LLC’s aluminum
polymers manufacturing business and ferric and ferrous sulfate
production facilities in  Pasadena ,  Texas , Brenntag said.  The acquisition of Altivia, which formulates, blends and
distributes water-treatment chemicals, “will considerably
strengthen our regional organization in the southwest as well as
our water additives business,” Brenntag management board member
William Fidler said. “Its strategically located facility in
Houston with river barge and rail capabilities will allow for
efficiency gains and further expansion.”  The Muelheim an der Ruhr, Germany-based company, whose
shares have climbed 42 percent over the past year, said the
transaction closed on Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
