Gasoline rose as Congress approved a
budget deal that averts spending cuts and higher taxes for most
Americans that threatened the U.S. economic recovery.  Futures climbed as the House passed a bill undoing income
tax increases that took effect yesterday for more than 99
percent of households. The bill, already passed by the Senate,
avoids more than $600 billion a year in scheduled spending
reductions and tax gains known as the fiscal cliff.  “The market is relieved that tax rates will not be rising
for the majority of Americans,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “Spending cuts have been
deferred for several months and demand will continue on its
regular seasonal path.”  Gasoline for February delivery gained 4.77 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $2.8094 a gallon at 9:32 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices climbed 4.7 percent in 2012. Trading
was closed yesterday for the New Year’s Day holiday.  Congress must now act as early as mid-February to raise the
nation’s $16.4 trillion debt ceiling. Republicans are expected
to use the need to raise the limit to force President  Barack
Obama  and congressional Democrats to accept cuts in entitlement
programs such as Medicare. A similar dispute in 2011 led to a
downgrade of the U.S. credit rating.  “The market pushed higher on idea we’re not going to go
off the fiscal cliff,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The next
level for gasoline is $2.90 to $3. But the next wave of gains
will be predicated on signs the economy is improving.”  Heating oil for February delivery gained 3.37 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $3.0655 a gallon. Prices rose 3.8 percent in 2012.  The average nationwide  retail price  for regular gasoline
fell 0.1 cent to $3.291 a gallon, AAA said today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
