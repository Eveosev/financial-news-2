Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. (SGYP) , a
developer of drugs for gastrointestinal disorders, surged the
most in seven weeks after its experimental medicine for
constipation worked better than a placebo in a trial.  Synergy rose 18 percent to $6.21 at 4 p.m. for the biggest
advance since Nov. 14. The shares of the New York-based company
have gained 77 percent in the last 12 months.  Synergyâ€™s plecanatide helped patients with chronic
idiopathic constipation have more spontaneous bowel movements
and led to improvements in areas such as stool consistency and
straining, the company said today in a statement. The incidence
of diarrhea was 9.7 percent compared with 1.3 percent for
patients taking a placebo.  The 12-week study of 951 patients was in the so-called
phase 2b/3 stage of trials, of three generally required for
regulatory approval. Linzess, from  Ironwood Pharmaceuticals
Inc. (IRWD) , was approved in August for chronic idiopathic constipation
and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
