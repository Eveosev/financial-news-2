Liverpool signed Chelsea striker
 Daniel Sturridge  to a “long-term” contract, the Premier League
soccer club said on its website.  The Reds didn’t reveal the transfer fee, which the Daily
Mail said is about 12 million pounds ($19.5 million).  Sturridge spent the past 3 1/2 years at Chelsea, scoring 24
goals in 96 matches. The 23-year-old becomes first signing for
Liverpool manager  Brendan Rodgers  during the January transfer
period.  “Brendan Rodgers said he sees me here for a long time, and
I also see myself here for a long time,” Sturridge said on
Liverpool’s  website . “I’ve not signed here to play for a couple
of years and then move on.”  Sturridge began his professional career at Manchester City
before moving to Chelsea in 2009. He made his debut with the
England national team in 2011, and also scored twice for Britain
at last year’s London Olympics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
