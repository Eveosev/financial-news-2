South Africa’s benchmark stock  index 
rose to a record as commodity prices surged after U.S. lawmakers
passed a bill that averted spending cuts and tax increases
threatening the world’s biggest economy.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All-Share Index climbed as much as 1.6
percent to 39,873.15, and traded 1.5 percent stronger at 11:20
a.m. in Johannesburg. The measure advanced 23 percent last year.
 Anglo American Plc (AAL) , a diversified miner that makes up about 9
percent of the gauge, surged 5 percent to a two-month high.  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  advanced 3.5 percent.  Copper and nickel led a rally in metal prices after the
House of Representatives voted in favor of the Senate’s budget
legislation. Republican lawmakers abandoned efforts to add
spending cuts to the bill, removing one impediment to a recovery
in the U.S. economy. Gold climbed to a two-week high while
platinum rose for a third day.  “Equity markets have taken a bullish tone” following the
budget pact, Quinten Bertenshaw, an analyst at ETM Analytics in
Johannesburg, and colleagues wrote in e-mailed comments. The
deal could boost demand for commodities and equities, they said.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , South Africa’s biggest gold
producer, rose 2.1 percent.  Anglo American Platinum Corp. Ltd. (AMS) ,
the biggest producer of the metal, advanced 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
