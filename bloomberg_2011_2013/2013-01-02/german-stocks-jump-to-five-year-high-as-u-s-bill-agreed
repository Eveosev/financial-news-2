German stocks rose, with the  DAX (DAX) 
Index jumping to its highest in nearly five years after the  U.S.
Congress  agreed a budget bill that avoids most scheduled tax
increases threatening a recovery in the world’s largest economy.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  rallied 4.1 percent to its
highest in more than 20 years. Volkswagen AG added 4 percent.
 Infineon Technologies AG (IFX)  increased 4.3 percent.  The DAX climbed 2.2 percent to 7,778.78 at the close of
trading in Frankfurt, the biggest gain since Nov. 19 and its
highest level since January 2008. The gauge rallied 29 percent
in 2012, its best annual performance since 2003, as the  European
Central Bank  and the  Federal Reserve  expanded asset purchase
programs. The broader  HDAX Index (HDAX)  also rose 2.2 percent today.  “It was the right thing to do to buy equities ahead of
this outcome and we feel the market was a bit too cautious,”
Herbert Perus, who helps oversee about $36 billion as head of
equities at Raiffeisen in Vienna, said, referring to the U.S.
agreement.  The U.S. House of Representatives passed the budget
legislation just after 11 p.m. in Washington yesterday, breaking
a yearlong impasse over how to prevent more than $600 billion in
tax increases and spending cuts. Still, Congress must act as
early as mid-February to prevent a default and the dispute may
reprise a similar 2011 episode that led to a downgrade of the
U.S. credit rating.  March Rally  “The U.S. is a leading indicator for the world economy.
Lawmakers will find another compromise in the last minute again
in February, and this will lead to another rally in March,”
said Perus.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  said he will sign the bill
after the 257-167 vote. The Senate approved the proposals 89-8
in the first hours of Jan. 1.  The number of shares changing hands in DAX companies today
was 27 percent higher than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  BMW, the world’s biggest maker of luxury cars, rose 4.1
percent to 75.93 euros, its highest level since August 1992.
Preferred shares of Volkswagen, the second-biggest carmaker,
gained 4 percent to 179 euros, its highest price in more than 20
years.  Infineon, Europe’s second-biggest semiconductor
manufacturer, advanced 4.3 percent to 6.40 euros.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s largest lender, gained 3.7
percent to 34.16 euros. Juergen Fitschen, the company’s co-chief
executive officer, said in an interview with Boersen Zeitung on
Dec. 29 that the bank favors the emergence of pan-European
lenders to compete with other regions. He also said he sees
further consolidation among European lenders.  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , the second-biggest, climbed 3.9 percent to
1.49 euros.  SMA Solar  SMA Solar Technology, the country’s largest solar company
by market value, reversed earlier gains, falling 1.1 percent to
18.80 euros. German developers added a record number of solar
panels in the first 11 months of last year, more than double the
quantity targeted by the government. Still, solar installations
fell 34 percent in November from a year earlier, according to
 data  from federal grid regulator Bundesnetzagentur.  Fresenius Medical Care AG, the world’s biggest supplier of
 kidney dialysis , declined 0.3 percent to 52.17 euros, the
steepest decline in the DAX. Obama said spending in the Medicare
healthcare program can be reduced as the country now needs to
tame its debt level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
