Crude options volatility fell as
future rose after Congress passed a bill to avert scheduled
spending cuts and higher taxes that threatened to weaken the
U.S. economic recovery.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 24.16 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 3:40 p.m., down from 25.71 percent on
Dec. 31. The market was closed yesterday for the New Year’s Day
holiday.  February-delivery crude oil advanced $1.30, or 1.4 percent,
to $93.12 a barrel on the Nymex, the highest settlement since
Sept. 18, as the House passed a bill undoing income tax
increases that took effect yesterday for more than 99 percent of
households. The bill, already approved by the Senate, avoids
more than $600 billion a year in scheduled spending reductions
and tax gains known as the fiscal cliff.  “The news was not overly bullish, not something that will
get us over $100, but we’ve got a little bit of stability here
now and you’ve got the higher price coming into effect,” said
Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New
York .  The most active options in electronic trading today were
February $100 calls, which fell 1 cent to 15 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,729 contracts at 3:45 p.m. in New York. February $90
puts were the second-most active, with 1,739 lots exchanged as
they declined 50 cents to 75 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 58
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets accounted for 53
percent of the 57,920 contracts traded.  March $105 calls were the most active options on Dec. 31
with 2,457 contracts changing hands. They rose 5 cents to 32
cents a barrel. February $100 calls increased 2 cents to 16
cents on 2,428 lots.  Open interest was highest for February $105 calls with
36,965 contracts. Next were March $70 puts at 29,251 lots and
February $110 calls at 27,160.  To contact the reporter on this story:
