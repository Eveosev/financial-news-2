The  Netherlands  set the coupon on
three-year notes to be sold next week at zero, meaning it won’t
pay interest on the debt, as top-rated euro-area nations lock in
borrowing costs that reached record lows last year.  One of four countries in the region with a AAA grade from
Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s,
the Netherlands will sell as as much as 3.5 billion euros ($4.6
billion) of the April 2016 securities.  Germany  sold two-year
debt with a zero coupon in May as investors sought a haven from
 Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis. The last time the Dutch
government sold three-year notes, on Nov. 27, they had a 0.75
percent coupon.  “It’s a reflection of where Dutch bonds have been trading
over recent months,” said  Padhraic Garvey , head of developed
markets debt strategy at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “There’s
been a flight into safe assets including Germany, and the
Netherlands. Yields are very close to zero, so why not?”  The notes will be sold on Jan. 8, the Dutch State Treasury
Agency said in a statement today.  Dutch government debt securities due between one and three
years made investors 19 percent in the five years through Dec.
31, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Three-year yields
fell to a euro-era low of 0.013 percent on Aug. 2 and were at
0.13 percent at 4:26 p.m. London time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
