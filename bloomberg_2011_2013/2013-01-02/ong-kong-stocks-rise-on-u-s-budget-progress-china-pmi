Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  capped
its biggest increase for a first trading day of any year since
2009, rising to a 19-month high, as U.S. lawmakers approved a
budget bill and  China ’s manufacturing sector expanded for a
third month.  Techtronic Industries Co., a maker of power tools that
counts  North America  as its biggest market, gained 3.3 percent.
 Citic Pacific Ltd. (267) , which makes steel, mines iron ore and sells
cars, climbed 11 percent, the most in three years. Financial
stocks jumped the most in benchmark, with the Hang Seng Finance
Index rising 3.3 percent, led by China Life Insurance Co., the
world’s  largest  insurer by market value, which added 6.7
percent, the most in a year.  The Hang Seng Index gained 2.9 percent to 23,311.98 at the
close in Hong Kong, the first time the gauge has exceeded 23,000
since June 2011. All 50 companies in the measure rose, with
volume 47 percent above the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
mainland companies gained 4 percent to 11,897.66, its biggest
advance in almost a year.  “Short term the  market sentiment  will remain quite
positive because investors believe the fiscal cliff can be
avoided,” said  Ben Kwong , chief operating officer at brokerage
KGI Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. “The China PMI of course is another
stimulus for the market. Those major gainers today are  the
China-related stocks. Investors are expecting continued
improvement of the Chinese economy will further boost confidence
on A-shares.”  Hong Kong’s benchmark index gained 23 percent last year,
its biggest annual increase since 2009, amid signs  China’s
economy  is improving and as central banks around the globe added
stimulus to boost growth.  Shares on the measure traded at 12.2 times average
estimated earnings compared with 13.8 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12.8 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Budget Vote  The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation
averting income-tax increases for most U.S. workers after
Republicans abandoned their effort to attach spending cuts that
would have been rejected by the Senate.  The 257-167 bipartisan vote breaks a yearlong impasse over
how to head off $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts
set to begin taking effect today. The Senate earlier passed the
bill, 89-8, and it goes to President  Barack Obama  for his
signature.  Techtronic gained 3.3 percent to HK$14.84.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) ,
a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., added
6.3 percent to HK$14.54, its highest level in three months. Yue
Yuen Industrial (Holdings) Ltd., a shoemaker that supplies Nike
Inc., increased 1.2 percent to HK$26.20.  The China Purchasing Managers’ Index was 50.6 in December,
the National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing said yesterday in Beijing. That
compares with the 51.0 median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 27 analysts and 50.6 in November. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  Buying Excuses  “Investors tend to find excuses to buy rather than sell,”
KGI’s Kwong said of the missed estimate. “Even though sometimes
the data is below market expectations, it’s still on the
expanding mode.”  Yesterday’s report, along with a separate manufacturing
gauge on Dec. 31 showing the fastest expansion in 19 months,
reflects increased infrastructure spending that’s helping drive
a rebound from a seven-quarter slowdown as a new generation of
Communist Party leaders takes the nation’s reins.  Citic Pacific rose 11 percent to HK$12.88.  Aluminum Corp.
of China (2600) , the biggest producer of the metal in the country,
jumped 6.2 percent to HK$3.77. China Longyuan Power Group Corp.,
which operates wind farms and coal-fired generators, gained 3.5
percent to HK$5.55, its highest level since May 2011.  Insurers Jump  Financial stocks rose after People’s Bank of China Governor
 Zhou Xiaochuan  said the nation will maintain “prudent”
monetary policy and deepen financial reforms in 2013 in a New
Year’s Eve statement posted on the central bank’s website.  Insurers led the advance after the China Securities
Regulatory Commission said it plans to allow asset management
units and securities brokers to set up mutual funds.  China Life gained 6.7 percent to HK$27. Ping An Insurance
(Group) Co. added 5.2 percent to HK$68.25, the most in 11
months. Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s
largest lender, rose 3.6 percent to HK$5.70, its highest level
in 17 months.  Casinos Rise  Casinos gained as Macau’s December gambling revenue rose
19.6 percent year on year versus a 17.5 percent estimate,
according to a statement from the Gaming Inspection &
Coordination Bureau. Gross casino revenue for 2012 rose 13.5
percent year on year to 304 billion patacas ($3.3 billion).  Wynn Macau Ltd., the Hong Kong-listed casino unit of Wynn
Resorts Ltd., gained 2.9 percent to HK$21.55. Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd., a casino operator founded by
billionaire Lui Che-Woo, climbed 3.1 percent to HK$31.30. Sands
China Ltd., the Hong Kong-listed unit of billionaire  Sheldon
Adelson ’s Las Vegas-based company, rose 5.3 percent to a record
high HK$35.75.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index climbed 2.4 percent to
23,226. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  slid 10 percent to 16, its
biggest drop since June, indicating traders expect a swing of
4.6 percent for the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
