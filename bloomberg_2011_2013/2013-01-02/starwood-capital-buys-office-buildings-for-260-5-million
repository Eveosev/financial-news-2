Starwood Capital Group LLC, the
investment firm led by  Barry Sternlicht , bought nine U.S. office
buildings for $260.5 million to gain income-producing properties
in markets with job growth and limited new supply.  The seller was Wells Real Estate Investment Trust II Inc.,
a non-traded REIT based in Norcross, Georgia, Starwood Capital
said today in a statement. The Class A office buildings include
1.9 million square feet (176,500 square meters) of space and are
located in cities including Pittsburgh; Salt Lake City;
 Charlotte  and Winston-Salem,  North Carolina ; and Orlando and
Tampa, Florida.  The buildings, with the exception of the one in Utah, are
95 percent leased, with more than 80 percent of the income
derived from investment-grade tenants, Greenwich, Connecticut-
based Starwood Capital said.  “Most of these buildings are located in markets with
outsized job- and population-growth projections,” Mark Keatley,
senior vice president of  Starwood Capital , said in the
statement.  The purchase price was “significantly” below the
replacement cost per square foot, said Chris Graham, a managing
director at Starwood Capital, which has more than $22 billion of
assets under management.  Wells REIT II, which focuses on office properties, has
about 82 buildings with more than 20 million square feet after
the sale to Starwood Capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
