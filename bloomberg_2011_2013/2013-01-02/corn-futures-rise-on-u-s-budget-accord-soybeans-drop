Corn futures rose for the third
straight session after U.S. lawmakers passed a bill averting
spending cuts and tax increases that threatened a recovery in
the U.S., the world’s biggest grain consumer. Soybeans dropped.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials jumped
as much as 1.6 percent, and equities gained. The dollar was
little changed after falling as much as 0.6 against a basket of
currencies, increasing the appeal of exports from the U.S., the
top shipper. Corn fell 13 percent in the five months ended Dec.
31 as overseas demand ebbed.  “There’s some bargain buying with higher stocks and a
weaker dollar,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “The markets are looking at the end of a
deflationary cycle and starting to think long term about easy
monetary policy in the U.S. leading to general commodity
inflation.”  Corn futures for March delivery rose 0.3 percent to $7.0025
a bushel at 10:28 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, heading
for the longest rally since late November. Last year, the most-
active contract gained 8 percent, the fourth straight increase,
after a drought cut U.S. production.  Prices pared earlier gains on speculation that  South
America  will harvest record crops this year, Grow said. Rain in
the next two weeks may boost yield potential in  Brazil , while
dry weather firms muddy soils for Argentine farmers to finish
planting corn and soybeans,  World Weather Inc.  said in a report.  Soybean futures for March delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$14.035 a bushel. Earlier, the price touched $13.9625, the
lowest since Nov. 20. In 2012, the oilseed advanced 17 percent.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
