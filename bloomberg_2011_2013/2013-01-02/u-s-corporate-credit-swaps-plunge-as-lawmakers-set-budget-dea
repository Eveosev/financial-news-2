A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
dropped the most in more than a year as lawmakers passed a
budget deal averting tax increases for most wage earners in the
world’s biggest economy.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 8
basis points to a mid-price of 86.5 basis points at 8:13 a.m. in
New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
biggest intraday plunge since Nov. 30, 2011.  President  Barack Obama  said he will sign into law the bill
passed by the U.S. House just after 11 p.m. yesterday in
 Washington , undoing tax increases for more than 99 percent of
households that took effect with the new year. The U.S. economic
expansion probably will be crimped without being halted by the
deal, according to economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank
of America Corp., easing concern that the world’s largest
economy may tumble into a recession, hindering companies’
ability to repay debt.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
