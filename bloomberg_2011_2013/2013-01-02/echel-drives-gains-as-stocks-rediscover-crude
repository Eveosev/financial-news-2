Russian stocks  traded in New York
soared to the highest level since September and are regaining
their correlation with oil after the U.S. budget deal repaired
the outlook for the world’s biggest consumer of crude.  The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Russian equities in the U.S. rallied 2 percent to 101.25
yesterday, lifting its 65-day correlation coefficient with New
York crude to 0.44, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The reading
fell to 0.42 on Dec. 31, the lowest level since March 5.  OAO
Mechel (MTL) ,  Russia ’s biggest producer of coal for steelmakers,
jumped to a three-month high, and Yandex NV gained the most
since March. The Moscow Exchange is closed until Jan. 8.  Oil, which together with natural gas contributes about 50
percent of Russian budget revenue, surged to a three-month high
yesterday, as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a deal to reverse tax
increases that came into force Jan. 1 and avert cuts to
spending. Russia’s crude oil and condensate  output  climbed 1.1
percent in 2012 from a year ago to a post-Soviet record, data
from the Energy Ministry in Moscow issued yesterday showed.  “Oil helps and markets are risk on,” Julian Rimmer, a
trader at CF Global in  London  who focuses on Russian and Turkish
stocks, said by phone yesterday. “The spike in Russian equities
has been amplified by low liquidity in the absence of a local
market. This move is attributable to a perceived resolution to
the U.S. fiscal impasse.”  Oil Rebounds  The 100-day correlation coefficient of oil and the Micex
Index was at 0.26 on the last day of 2012, the lowest since May
20, 2011. A reading of 1 implies two securities are trading in
lockstep. The Micex gauge added 5.4 percent last year, while the
Russia-US index increased 9.7 percent.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, gained 2.6 percent to $30.68, the
highest level since Sept. 14. The RTS Volatility Index, which
measures expected swings in the  stock futures , declined 2.7
percent to 23.56 points.  Crude oil for February delivery climbed 1.4 percent to
$93.12 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest level
since Sept. 18. The futures dropped 7.1 percent last year, the
first decline since 2008. Brent oil for February settlement
climbed 1.2 percent to $112.47 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures  Europe .  Urals crude , Russia’s chief export oil blend,
gained 1.1 percent to $110.98 yesterday.  Mechel’s Premium  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge  of 24 commodities rallied
0.9 percent to 652,560, the highest level since Oct. 19.  American depositary receipts of  Mechel (MTLR)  gained 5.8 percent
to $7.33 in New York yesterday. The ADRs settled at a 8.3
percent premium to the company’s Moscow-listed shares, the
widest gap since Feb. 3, 2012. Shares last traded in Moscow at
204.4 rubles, or $6.77.  Yandex NV (YNDX) , owner of Russia’s most-used search engine, rose
6.8 percent to $22.995 in New York, gaining the most since March
2. The company’s share of Russian Internet searches rose to 60.5
percent last month, from 60.2 percent in November, according to
data on LiveInternet researcher’s website.  Google Inc. (GOOG)  saw its
share of Russian searches decrease to 26.4 percent in December
from 26.5 percent in November.  OAO RusHydro (RSHYY)  rallied 5.9 percent to $2.49 in New York,
settling at a 2.5 percent premium to the company’s Moscow  stock .
That was the biggest gap since March 1. RusHydro settled at 73.4
kopecks, or 2.4 U.S. cents on its last trading day.  OAO Lukoil (LUKOY) , Russia’s second-biggest oil producer, fell 0.7
percent to $67 as trading volume jumped to 2.5 times the daily
average for the past three months, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The stock was the biggest decliner on the  Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  yesterday.  Oil Output  Moscow-based Lukoil, which trails state-backed  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) 
by output, and OAO Slavneft were the only two oil producers in
the country that saw a decline in their crude output in 2012,
data from the Energy Ministry’s CTEK unit showed yesterday.
Russia’s crude oil and condensate production climbed 1.1 percent
in 2012 from a year ago to a post-Soviet record, the data show.
Lukoil saw its oil output slip 0.8 percent in 2012 from 2011,
the data show.  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
