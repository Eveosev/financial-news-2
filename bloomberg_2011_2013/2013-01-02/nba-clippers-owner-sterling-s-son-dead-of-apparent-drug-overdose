The son of Los Angeles Clippers owner
Donald Sterling was found dead of an apparent drug overdose, the
Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department said in a statement.  The body of 32-year-old Scott Sterling was found last night
at his Malibu home, according to the statement. He was
pronounced dead at the scene, where coroner’s personnel said he
died of an apparent drug overdose, according to the statement.  Scott Sterling hadn’t been heard from for several days, the
department said in the statement.  “Our son Scott has fought a long and valiant battle
against type one diabetes,” said his parents, Donald and Shelly
Sterling, in an e-mail from the club. “His death is a terrible
tragedy, the effects of which will be felt forever by our family
and all those who knew and loved him.”  Donald Sterling, a real-estate developer, is in his 32nd
season as owner of the Clippers, who have a National Basketball
Association-high 25 wins. The team’s 17-game winning streak was
snapped last night in Denver.  “Scott was a friend to many in the Clippers’ family and he
will be greatly missed,” Clippers President Andy Roeser said in
an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
