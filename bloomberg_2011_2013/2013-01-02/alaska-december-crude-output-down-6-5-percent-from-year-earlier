Oil production from  Alaska ’s North
Slope slid 6.5 percent in December from a year earlier as output
from existing wells shrinks and isn’t matched by new additions.  Production   averaged  582,150 barrels a day last month, down
from 622,355 barrels in  December 2011 , the state tax division
said on its website. Output was up from 581,938 barrels a day in
 November .  Oil output from Alaska’s North Slope has declined each year
since 2002 as wells age and yield less crude, driving refineries
on the U.S. West Coast to rely increasingly on imports from
other countries and rail shipments from the U.S. Midwest. Flint
Hills Resources LLC shut a crude unit at its North Pole refinery
in Alaska in August, citing rising oil costs.  “In total, we’re not seeing enough new production to
offset the natural declining rates of production from existing
wells,” Ed King, petroleum economist for Alaska’s tax division
in Anchorage, Alaska, said by telephone.  Inventories of the feedstock at the Valdez marine terminal,
the northernmost ice-free port in  North America , averaged 3.89
million barrels last month, ranging from a high of 4.8 million
on Dec. 27 to a low of 3.14 million on Dec. 31, according to the
tax division.  Alaska North Slope crude  was unchanged at a premium of
$17.60 a barrel to U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate at
4:13 p.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The fuel’s premium more than doubled last year on
shrinking supplies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
