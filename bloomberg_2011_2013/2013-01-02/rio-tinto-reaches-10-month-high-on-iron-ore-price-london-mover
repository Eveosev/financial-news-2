Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) , the world’s second-
largest mining company, rose to its highest in 10 months as iron
ore prices topped $140 a ton for the first time in eight months.  The  shares  gained 5.1 percent, or 179.5 pence, to 3,699
pence at 2:28 p.m. in  London , the highest price since Feb. 28.
The stock has risen 21 percent over the past six months, giving
the company a market value of 71.1 billion pounds ($115.6
billion). European stocks advanced after U.S. lawmakers passed a
bill that averted spending cuts and tax gains. The volume of
shares traded at 5.4 million was 23 percent higher than the
three-month daily average.  “There will be some macro rally, but it is mostly about
 iron ore ,” Des Kilalea, an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in
London, said in an interview. “Rio is 70 percent an iron ore
company.” Kilalea has an outperform rating on the stock,  Iron ore prices , which were unchanged today, have risen 67
percent to $144.90 a metric ton at  China ’s Tianjin port, after
touching a three-year low on Sept. 5, amid mounting confidence
that China, the biggest buyer of the metal, will import a record
amount in 2013. Accelerating economic growth in China is driving
demand for steel used in construction.  Prices are also being supported by the shutdown of some
iron ore mines in India after  Supreme Court  imposed bans in the
states of Karnataka and Goa because of pollution concerns. That
has helped lower-cost producers like Rio to gain market share.  Rio’s current share price implies investors are set for a
 4.8 percent return , excluding dividends, over the next year,
based on the average 12-month price target of 3,868 pence of 32
analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The potential return is the
lowest in three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company was the ninth-best performer in the  FTSE 100
Index. (UKX)   Eight of the top 10 gainers  in the index were commodity
producers, all showing gains of 5 percent or more.  Rio is targeting savings of $5 billion by the end of 2014,
while at the same time boosting production at its iron ore,
copper and alumina units, it said Nov. 29.  Rio Tinto  gained A$1.61, or 2.4 percent, to A$67.62 at the
close in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
