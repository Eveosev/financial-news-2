Killings related to drug violence in
 Mexico  climbed 0.9 percent in 2012 from the year before,
newspaper Milenio  reported  today on its website.  Last year’s death toll of 12,394 pushed the number of
killings in the past six years to more than 54,000, according to
the Mexico City-based daily. The deadliest year was 2010 with
12,658 deaths.  There were 982 deaths in December, President Enrique Pena Nieto’s first month in office, 33 more than in the previous
month, Milenio said. Two states bordering the U.S. had the
highest death tolls in December: 122 in Chihuahua and 105 in
Coahuila.  To contact the reporter on this story:
