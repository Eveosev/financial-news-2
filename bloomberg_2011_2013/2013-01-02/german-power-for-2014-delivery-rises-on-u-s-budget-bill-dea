German 2014 power declined to a
record as wind generation is set to nearly double tomorrow.  German 2014 baseload power, for delivery around the clock,
fell as much as 0.6 percent to the lowest since Bloomberg
started tracking the contract in January 2010, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The contract, a European
benchmark, slid 25 cents to 45.15 ($59.63) euros a megawatt-hour
as of 4:34 p.m. Berlin time.  Power for delivery tomorrow dropped in the day-ahead
auction on the  European Energy Exchange AG  as more wind power is
anticipated tomorrow. Today’s auction resulted in a price of
33.77 euros a megawatt-hour, a drop of 12 percent from
yesterday’s day-ahead sale at 38.24 euros. German  day-ahead
power  stood at 31 euros, according to broker data on Bloomberg.  German wind farms may generate nearly 15,000 megawatts
tomorrow, compared with about 8,000 megawatts today,  Meteologica
SA , a Madrid-based weather forecaster, said on its website.  The French year-ahead contract fell as much as 0.8 percent
to 47.50 euros a megawatt-hour, the least since January 2011.
Electricite de France SA restarted the 1,330 megawatt Paluel-4
reactor after maintenance yesterday, the country’s grid
operator, Reseau de Transport d’Electricite, said on its
website.  Nordic power for delivery  next month  fell as temperatures
in Oslo may rise to zero degrees Celsius (32 Fahrenheit) on Jan.
9 from minus 7 degrees today, according to CustomWeather Inc.
data on Bloomberg. That compares with a five-year seasonal norm
of minus 7 degrees.  The power contract for February dropped as much as 1.8
percent to 41.85 euros a megawatt-hour and closed 32 cents lower
at 42.30 euros on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in
Oslo.  European coal for delivery in 2014 to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp stood at $102.55 a metric ton as of 3 p.m. in  London ,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg, its first gain
since Dec. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
