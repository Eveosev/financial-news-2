Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed on speculation that the widest price difference between
the two since September will spur demand for the biofuel.  The grain-based additive traded 61.61 cents below gasoline,
based on front-month futures compared with 62.2 cents on Dec.
31, the widest since Sept. 28. Gasoline traded for February
delivery while ethanol traded for January. The ethanol contract
expires Jan. 4.  “You would think they would increase ethanol blending,”
said  Mark Schultz , chief analyst at Northstar Commodity
Investment Co. in  Minneapolis . “The spread has moved up to
about 60 cents.”  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 1.1 cents to
settle at $2.179 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
futures were down 1.1 percent from a year ago.  The more actively traded February contract fell 1.6 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $2.194 a gallon, about 60 cents cheaper than
gasoline.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf rose 3
cents, or 1.4 percent, to $2.245 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive increased 1 cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.195, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol on the West Coast was unchanged at $2.35 a gallon
and in  New York  the biofuel slipped 0.5 cent to $2.28.  Gasoline for February delivery jumped 3.34 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.7951 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Corn for March delivery decreased 7.5 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $6.9075 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 30 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
31 cents Dec. 31, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed
from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock, according to
data collected by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
