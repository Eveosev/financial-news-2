Chelsea was given permission to
negotiate with Newcastle striker Demba Ba after making an
official offer for the Senegalese soccer player, his current
club said today.  The 27-year-old can negotiate with the west London club
after Chelsea met the requirements of the release clause in his
contract, Newcastle said in a statement on its website. He’s
been left out of the Newcastle team for tonight’s game against
Everton.  Ba, who was born in  France , joined Newcastle in 2011 on a
free transfer from West Ham, and has scored 13 times so far this
season. He scored 16 goals last season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
