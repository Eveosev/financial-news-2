Amar’e Stoudemire made his season
debut for the  New York Knicks  after missing the opening two
months of their National Basketball Association campaign
following knee surgery.  Stoudemire, 30, came off the bench with 3 minutes, 31
seconds remaining in the first quarter of the Knicks’ game
against the Portland Trail Blazers at Madison Square Garden,
receiving a standing ovation before blowing a kiss to the fans.  “I did everything I can to get back into top shape and be
healthy again,” Stoudemire said in a televised pre-game
interview. “I followed every instruction the training staff
gave me and I feel great now.”  Stoudemire, who averaged 17.5 points and 7.8 rebounds per
game last season, injured his left knee Oct. 19 in a preseason
game and later had surgery to remove debris, damaged cartilage
and bone from around the joint. It was the same knee that needed
microfracture surgery in 2005.  In his absence, the Knicks have gone 21-9 to lead the
 Atlantic Division  by 5 1/2 games over the Brooklyn Nets.  Carmelo Anthony , who missed the last two games with a
hyperextended left knee, also returned to the Knicks’ lineup.
Anthony’s 28.5 points per game are tied with the Oklahoma City
Thunder’s Kevin Durant for second in the NBA behind the Los
Angeles Lakers’ Kobe Bryant (30.1).  To contact the reporter on this story:
