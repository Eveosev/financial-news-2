Munich Re joined with  General
Electric Co. (GE)  and Electricite de  France  SA to buy 32 wind farms
in France from  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  as part of its plan to invest 2.5
billion euros ($3.3 billion) in renewable-energy assets.  The purchase of a total capacity of 321.4 megawatts is
valued at 350 million euros, plus as much as 50 million euros
depending on output in the next five years, the companies said
in a joint statement. Munich Re’s investment arm MEAG Munich
Ergo AssetManagement GmbH and GE Energy Financial Services will
each own 40 percent, and EDF Energies Nouvelles 20 percent.  EDF Energies Nouvelles will provide asset management, while
operating and maintaining the plants, which were commissioned
from 2006 to 2012 and are connected to the power grid, they
said. The companies plan to replace some of the farms’ 160
turbines with GE machines to improve efficiency and reliability.  The share of Munich Re, the world’s biggest reinsurer, is
valued in “the low three-digit millions,” the company said in
a separate e-mailed statement. Munich Re has realized a figure
in the “high three-digit millions” of its renewables program,
Josef Wild, a spokesman, said today by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
