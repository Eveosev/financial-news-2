Former Philadelphia Eagles coach  Andy Reid , who was fired two days ago, interviewed with the Kansas
City Chiefs and  Arizona Cardinals  today,  ESPN reported .  Reid, 54, was dismissed after the Eagles went 4-12 this
season, his worst record since joining the team in 1999. He led
the Eagles to five National Football Conference title games and
a Super Bowl appearance in 14 seasons with the franchise.  Cardinals  President Michael Bidwill interviewed Arizona
defensive coordinator Ray Horton yesterday and will fly to
Denver to interview Broncos offensive coordinator Mike McCoy
this weekend. Reid is the leading candidate to replace Ken Whisenhunt, who also was fired on Dec. 31, ESPN said, citing
people familiar with the negotiations.  The  Chiefs , who fired coach Romeo Crennel two days ago,
interviewed Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter
yesterday before meeting with Reid in Philadelphia today. The
Falcons issued a release saying that Koetter wouldnâ€™t pursue a
head-coaching job this offseason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
