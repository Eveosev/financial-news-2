Warren Buffett ’s  MidAmerican Energy
Holdings Co. (BRK/A)  agreed to spend as much as $2.5 billion to build
two solar projects in  California  that are set to be the world’s
largest photovoltaic development.  MidAmerican acquired the 579-megawatt Antelope Valley
projects in Kern and Los Angeles counties from  SunPower Corp. (SPWR) ,
according to a statement today. MidAmerican will pay San Jose,
California-based SunPower $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the
projects and a three-year contract to build them. SunPower also
will operate and maintain the projects under a multi-year
agreement with MidAmerican.  Buffett has been increasing investment in wind and solar
farms and last year formed a MidAmerican unit to support the
projects it’s acquired, including the $2.4 billion 550-megawatt
Topaz solar farm in California. Chief Financial Officer Patrick Goodman said in November the company favors bets on renewable
energy amid high utility valuations. California is the biggest
U.S. solar market.  “Customers, investors and banks see this as a stamp of
approval on SunPower,” the solar company’s President and Chief
Executive Officer Tom Werner said in an interview today. “It’s
a huge deal for us, roughly the size of our company.”  Ingrid Ekstrom, a spokeswoman for SunPower, declined to
specify how much of the total amount being spent is construction
costs and how much is the purchase price. SunPower is  66 percent
owned  by  France ’s  Total SA (FP)  and has a market value of $732
million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Captive’ Sales  The sale gives panel-maker SunPower “a sizable captive
demand channel for its modules which should help ensure the
company maintains healthy factory utilization levels even if the
oversupply conditions in the industry take longer than expected
to be resolved,” Ben Kallo and Christopher M. Kovacs, analysts
for Robert W. Baird & Co., said in a note today.  Construction of the Antelope Valley project is expected to
begin this quarter, with completion by the end of 2015, SunPower
said in a  filing  with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  “Together, the two combined projects will form the largest
permitted solar photovoltaic power development in the world and
will create an estimated 650 jobs during construction,”
according to the statement. The projects will provide energy to
 Edison International (EIX)  under two long-term power-purchase
contracts.  MidAmerican Renewables, a subsidiary of MidAmerican Energy,
has more than 1,830 megawatts of assets, including wind power,
geothermal, solar and hydro, according to today’s statement.
MidAmerican is owned by Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  SunPower  rose  9.1 percent to $6.13 at the close in New
York. Berkshire, based in Omaha,  Nebraska  rose 4.1 percent to
$139,610.  To contact the reporters on this story:
