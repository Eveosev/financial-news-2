Amar’e Stoudemire made his season
debut and  Carmelo Anthony  also returned from injury to score 45
points in the  New York  Knicks’ 105-100 home loss to the  Portland
Trail Blazers .  The  Denver Nuggets  snapped the Los Angeles Clippers’ 17-
game win streak in the  National Basketball Association  last
night with a 92-78 home win as  Danilo Gallinari  scored a game-
high 17 points.  The Knicks, who trailed by as many as 19 points in the
first half at Madison Square Garden, were down 98-87 with three
minutes remaining before forging a comeback that was halted with
15 seconds left when Anthony missed a 3-point try that would
have tied the score.  “Defensively, we’re just not where we were early in the
year and we’ve got to get back to that,” Knicks coach  Mike Woodson  said at a televised postgame news conference.  Anthony, who missed the last two games because of a hyper-
extended left knee, went 14-of-24 from the field and hit five 3-
pointers to tie his season-high scoring effort.  Stoudemire, who missed the first two months of the season
following knee surgery, came off the bench to a standing ovation
with 3 minutes, 31 seconds remaining the first quarter.  The 6-foot-11 forward went scoreless in the first half and
finished with six points on 3-of-8 shooting and one rebound in
almost 17 minutes of action for the Knicks, who fell to 21-10
this season.  Stoudemire, who averaged 17.5 points and 7.8 rebounds per
game last season, injured his left knee Oct. 19 in a preseason
game and later had surgery to remove debris, damaged cartilage
and bone from around the joint. It was the same knee that needed
microfracture surgery in 2005.  Stoudemire Rushed  “He was kind of rushing a little bit, but you expect
that,” Woodson added. “He’ll be fine. We’ll get him back to
the old Amar’e.”  Nicolas Batum scored 26 points for the Trail Blazers
(16-14) and rookie Damian Lillard added 21, including a 3-
pointer with 35 seconds left that helped secure the win.  The Clippers dropped to 25-7 after the defeat in Denver,
their first loss since Nov. 26. They went 16-0 in December and
their 17-game win streak was the NBA’s longest since the  Boston
Celtics  won 19 in a row during the 2008-09 season.  Blake Griffin  and Eric Bledsoe each had 12 points for the
Clippers, while DeAndre Jordan added 11 points and 11 rebounds.  In other NBA games yesterday, it was Dallas 103, Washington
94; Detroit 103, Sacramento 97; Atlanta 95, New Orleans 86; and
Philadelphia 103, the Los Angeles Lakers 99.  To contact the reporter on this story:
