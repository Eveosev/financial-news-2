Sales of new autos, a bright spot for
the U.S. in 2012, will grow further this year as an improving
economy and demand for pickups and for midsize cars boosts
registrations 6.6 percent, according to  R.L. Polk & Co. (POLL)   About 15.3 million new light-vehicle sales will be
registered in 2013, up less than 1 million from last year, the
Southfield, Michigan-based auto researcher said in a report
today. The growth rate may be less than half that of 2012 as the
industry has already regained much of the volume lost to the
recession, Polk said.  “There’s going to be growth, but some demand has been
satisfied at this point,” Anthony Pratt, Polk’s director of
forecasting for the Americas, said in a phone interview. “The
spigot has been on, but it hasn’t been on at full blast.”  Deliveries of cars and trucks in 2012, due to be reported
tomorrow, were the best since 2007 as new model introductions
and  consumer confidence  grew. Demand for pickups, a key source
of earnings for U.S.-based  General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Ford Motor Co. (F) 
and Chrysler Group LLC, should be particularly strong this year,
fueled by new designs and a housing-market recovery, Polk said.  The U.S. averaged 16.8 million light-vehicle deliveries
annually from 2000 to 2007 before dropping to 10.4 million in
2009, a 27-year-low, according to Autodata Corp.  December Sales  Auto sales in December probably climbed to 1.36 million,
the average of estimates by eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. That would push full-year deliveries to 14.5 million.
Polk’s estimates are based on registration data from state
motor-vehicle agencies and may vary from sales figures released
by automakers, Pratt said.  Registrations in the U.S. will rise to 15.8 million
vehicles in 2014 and 16.2 million by 2015, Polk said.
Registrations may contract slightly in 2016 to 16 million units,
reflecting the cyclical nature of the auto industry, Pratt said.  North American auto production should grow 2.4 percent this
year to 15.9 million cars and trucks, Pratt said. Polk estimated
that vehicle output in the region will grow to 16.3 million
autos in 2014 and to 16.7 million by 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
