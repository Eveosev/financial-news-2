Temperatures are expected to rise
above normal across the eastern U.S. next week and may cut
energy demand and melt snow in the region.  Temperatures may increase 8 to 14 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4
to 7.8 Celsius) above normal Jan. 7 to Jan. 11 from the Midwest
to the Middle Atlantic, according to a forecast from  MDA Weather
Services  in Gaithersburg, Maryland. In  New York  and  New England ,
temperatures may rise to 5 to 7 degrees above average.  “An already-warm outlook turned significantly warmer
across the Eastern half” of the country, an MDA note to clients
said. The higher temperatures “over the core of the Midwest
will not only cut back on heating demand, but should also
greatly diminish snow cover.”  Energy traders look to long-range forecasts to gauge
potential fuel use. Above-normal temperatures in the large
cities of the Midwest and Northeast may decrease demand for
energy to warm homes and businesses, suppressing natural gas and
heating oil prices.  The East Coast is expected to have above-average
temperatures through Jan. 16, MDA said. Western parts of the
U.S. and  Canada  are forecast to have temperatures from 5 to 14
degrees below normal during the same period.  In New York, the normal average temperature for Jan. 9 is
about 33 degrees, according to MDA. It’s 29 in Boston; 24 in
Chicago; 32 in St. Louis; 53 in Houston; 19 in Calgary,  Alberta ;
42 in  Seattle ; and 55 in Burbank, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
