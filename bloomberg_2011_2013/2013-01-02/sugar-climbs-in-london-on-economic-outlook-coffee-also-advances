Sugar advanced to an almost one-month
high on speculation that demand for commodities will rise after
U.S. lawmakers reached a budget deal. Coffee, cotton and cocoa
also gained, while orange juice fell.  The vote in the  House of Representatives  broke a yearlong
impasse over how to avert $600 billion in tax increases and
spending cuts that threatened to send the economy back into
recession. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw
materials jumped as much as 1.6 percent.  Commodities “are going to enjoy a nice bounce after the
majority of fiscal-cliff worries are now behind us,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates, said in an e-mail.  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 0.9 percent to settle
at 19.69 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, after touching 19.75 cents, the highest for a most-active
contract since Dec. 4. Prices tumbled 16 percent last year.  Also on ICE, arabica-coffee futures for March delivery rose
3.9 percent to close at $1.494 a pound, the biggest gain since
Sept. 10. Prices dropped 37 percent last year.  Cocoa futures for March delivery advanced 1 percent to
close at $2,259 a metric ton in  New York , capping the first
increase since Dec. 14. Prices rose 6 percent last year.  Cotton futures for March delivery added 0.3 percent to
settle at 75.36 cents a pound on ICE. The fiber fell 18 percent
in 2012.  Orange-juice futures for March delivery slid 0.6 percent to
close at $1.166 a pound in New York. Prices are down 19 percent
since reaching a seven-month high on Dec. 19.  Florida  “didn’t get cold,” Sterling Smith, a market
specialist at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said in an e-mail.
“The market is taking out most of the frost premium. Also, the
good weather in Brazil is helping crops there, adding to the
bearishness.”  Brazil  is the world’s largest orange grower, followed by
Florida.  To contact the reporter on this story:
