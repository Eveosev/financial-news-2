The dollar gained to its strongest
level in three weeks against the euro on speculation U.S. policy
makers will struggle to reach agreement on raising the nation’s
debt limit, underpinning demand for the safest assets.  The yen and the greenback rose versus most major peers as
minutes of the  Federal Reserve ’s last meeting showed policy
makers said they’ll probably end their $85 billion monthly bond
purchases sometime in 2013.  Brazil ’s real erased early losses on
speculation the central bank will allow it to advance more.  “The dollar got a lift out of the latest Fed minutes,
which for the first time entertained the notion of the bank
scaling back some of its easy monetary policies,” said  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst in  Washington  at Western Union
Business Solutions, a unit of Western Union Co. “The Fed’s low-
rate policies have been a leading source of weakness for the
greenback.”  The dollar advanced 1 percent to $1.3049 per euro at 5 p.m.
 New York  time and reached $1.3047, the strongest level since
Dec. 13. It touched $1.33 yesterday, the weakest since Dec. 19.
The yen climbed 1.2 percent to 113.84 per euro.  Japan ’s currency
appreciated 0.1 percent to 87.24 per dollar after declining to
87.36, the weakest since July 2010. It gained as much as 0.7
percent.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, reached the highest level in more than three
weeks. It rose as much as 0.8 percent to 80.463 before trading
at 80.443.  Fed Minutes  The greenback extended gains versus the euro as minutes
released today of the Fed’s Dec. 11-12 meeting showed policy
makers divided over whether the latest bond purchases under the
central bank’s quantitative-easing stimulus strategy will
conclude in mid-2013 or at year-end.  Four years after cutting the benchmark  interest rate  to
virtually zero, policy makers have expanded their third round of
quantitative easing to include $40 billion in mortgage bonds and
$45 billion in Treasuries. In the first two rounds, the central
bank bought $2.3 trillion in securities to fuel economic growth
and spur employment.  The yen and dollar gained amid concern the  U.S. Treasury 
will exhaust what it called “extraordinary” measures to keep
funding the government by February or March after the nation hit
its $16.4 trillion debt ceiling Dec. 31.  “All the way through the first few months of the year, it
will be fiscal policy and monetary policy which are at the
forefront of people’s minds,” said  Paul Robson , a senior
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in
 London .  Dollar Outlook  The U.S. currency will advance to $1.19 per euro by year-
end, Robson said. That compares with a median projection of
$1.27, based on analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  The implied  volatility  of three-month options for Group of
Seven currencies fell for a second day, touching 7.54 percent,
the lowest level since Dec. 21, according to the JPMorgan G7
 Volatility Index . A decrease makes investments in currencies
with higher benchmark interest rates more attractive as the risk
in such trades is that market moves will erase profits. The
average in 2012 was 9.23 percent.  Brazil’s real gained as much as 0.6 percent to 2.0334 to
the dollar amid bets the central bank will allow further
appreciation to help contain inflation. It was little changed at
2.0457 after trimming gains. It weakened 0.2 percent earlier.
The currency declined 9 percent in 2012, losing the most against
the greenback after an 11 percent drop by the yen.  Rand Drops  South Africa ’s rand declined against all of its 16 most-
traded peers as U.S. debt-ceiling speculation damped demand for
riskier assets. It dropped 1.2 percent to 8.5901 per dollar and
reached 8.5974, the lowest level in more than a week.  South Korea ’s won rose versus most major peers even amid
bets the central bank will cut interest rates as early as next
week to slow gains in the currency. It appreciated 0.2 percent
to 1,061.65 per dollar and touched 1,061.64, its strongest level
since Sept. 2, 2011.  Companies in the U.S. added 215,000 workers in December, up
from a revised gain of 148,000 in November, the ADP Research
Institute said. The median forecast of 36 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for an advance of 140,000. Labor Department
data tomorrow will show nonfarm payrolls rose by 153,000 workers
last month, versus 146,000 in November, another survey showed.  The dollar fell yesterday to a two-week low against the
euro after the  U.S. Congress  passed a bill on Jan. 1 making
income-tax cuts started under President  George W. Bush  permanent
for most workers, while reductions in the rates for top earners
will expire. That averted $600 billion in immediate tax
increases and spending cuts, known as the fiscal cliff, which
risked pushing the  U.S. economy  into a recession.  The  International Monetary Fund  said in a statement
yesterday that “the economic recovery would have been
derailed” without the action by the U.S. Congress. The U.S. now
needs to raise its debt ceiling “expeditiously,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
