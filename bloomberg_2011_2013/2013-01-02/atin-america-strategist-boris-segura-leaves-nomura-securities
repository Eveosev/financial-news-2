Boris Segura  has left Nomura
Securities Co. after working there two years as a fixed-income
strategist for Latin America, according to Jonathan Hodgkinson,
a spokesman for the bank.  Segura, 44, joined Nomura in 2010 from Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc. Hodgkinson said in a telephone interview
that he had no more information on Segura’s move.  The Americas contributed 33 percent to Tokyo-based Nomura’s
global wholesale revenue in its fiscal second quarter, the
company said in an Oct. 29 presentation. Nomura has expanded to
2,425 employees in the Americas as of Sept. 30 from 1,468 three
years earlier, according to company filings.  Nomura shares have surged 85 percent since Chief Executive
Officer Koji Nagai took the post on Aug. 1. Nagai has promised
to cut $1 billion of costs and focus on Japan and elsewhere in
Asia as the firm that bought part of bankrupt Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in 2008 scales back its overseas ambitions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
