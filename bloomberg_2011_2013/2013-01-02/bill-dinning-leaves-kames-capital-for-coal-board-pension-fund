Bill Dinning quit as head of
investment strategy at Kames Capital Plc, the Edinburgh-based
fund unit of Dutch insurer  Aegon NV (AGN) , to become investment
strategist for Coal Pension Trustees Services Ltd., which
oversees funds for retired mineworkers, managers and staff.  Dinning, 53, resigned Nov. 1 after almost eight years,
Kames said in an e-mailed statement today. Dinning, who lives in
Kent, southeast of  London , will be based in the U.K. capital,
Kames said. No one was available for comment at the coal funds,
which manage 20 billion pounds ($32.6 billion) in assets.  Ian Cooke, who was head of U.S. equities, left last month
and was replaced by Marcus Chandler, who will be lead fund
manager for the Kames American Equity fund, Kames said in the
statement.  The change follows a review of its overseas equity
capabilities by Piers Hillier, who was appointed head of global
equities last year. Peter Pih, a quantitative analyst, also left
last month, Kames said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
