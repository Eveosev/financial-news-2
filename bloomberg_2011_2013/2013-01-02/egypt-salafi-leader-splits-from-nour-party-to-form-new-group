The former head of  Egypt ’s Salafi
Nour Party is forming a new political group before parliamentary
elections due to be announced in the next two months, the state-
run Ahram Online reported.  Emad Abdel-Ghafour, who was appointed as an adviser to
President Mohamed Mursi, said he would set up the Watan, or
homeland, party with a platform of dignity and social justice,
the website reported today. “We want the Islamic Sharia to be a
reality we can live in” and not just rhetoric, Abdel-Ghafour,
who resigned as the Nour Party’s head last week, was quoted as
saying.  Hazem Abu Ismail, another prominent Salafi cleric who had
sought to run in the presidential race, also announced he was
setting up a political party that would work in tandem with the
Watan Party in the elections.  The Nour Party headed a Salafi bloc that finished second
behind the group backed by Mursi’s Muslim Brotherhood in
parliamentary elections a year ago, the first held after the
uprising that ousted  Hosni Mubarak .  To contact the reporter on this story:
