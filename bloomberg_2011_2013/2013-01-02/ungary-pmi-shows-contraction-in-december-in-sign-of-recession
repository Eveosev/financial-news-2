Hungary’s purchasing managers’ index
declined in December, in the latest signal that the economy
probably failed to emerge from its recession last year.  The PMI, as reported by the purchasing managers of 100
manufacturing companies, fell to 48.9 points in December, the
second-lowest reading last year, from a revised 52.1 points in
November, MLBKT, the company which compiles the data, said in a
report today.  Hungary is battling its second  recession  in four years as
government policies damage investor confidence and trade and
banking links with the slumping euro area drag down growth. The
economy shrank for a third consecutive quarter in the July-
September period.  Industrial output, the engine of the economy, plummeted 3.8
percent in October, the most in almost three years, indicating
the nation’s recession probably extended into the fourth quarter
of last year.  The economy will expand 0.3 percent this year and 1.3
percent in 2014 after contracting 1.2 percent last year,
according to the the latest European Commission forecast
published on Nov. 7.  Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government is damaging the
economy through discriminatory, opaque and unpredictable
policies, leading to record-low investments and a lack of
growth, the Joint Venture Association, one of the biggest
company lobby groups, said on Dec. 11.  The PMI index is a weighted average of five indexes: new
orders, production volume, employment, transportation time, and
purchased inventory. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction
in output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
