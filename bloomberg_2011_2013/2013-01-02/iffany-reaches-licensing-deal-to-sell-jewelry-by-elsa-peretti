Tiffany & Co. (TIF) , the luxury jeweler
whose profit has trailed analysts’ estimates for four straight
quarters, reached an agreement to continue selling jewelry by
Elsa Peretti, which accounts for about 10 percent of its sales.  Peretti will receive a one-time payment of $47 million and
royalties as part of the 20-year licensing contract, the New
York-based company said today in a filing. Tiffany has been
Peretti’s sole licensee since 1974.  The accord allows Tiffany to retain exclusive rights to
Peretti’s designs, which include pieces such as “Diamonds by
the Yard” and iconic heart- and bean-shaped pendants. Tiffany,
the world’s second-largest luxury jeweler, recorded  revenue  of
$3.64 billion in its fiscal 2011.  Tiffany, the second-largest largest luxury jewelry maker,
said last year that failing to reach a agreement with Peretti
may “adversely” affect earnings. Peretti expressed interest in
ending her accord with Tiffany, and the two sides were
discussing a phased wind-down of sales of the designer’s
products as an alternative to buying her trademarks.  Tiffany  rose  1.8 percent to $58.37 at 10:47 a.m. in New
York. The shares dropped 13 percent last year.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA is the world’s largest luxury
jewelry maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
