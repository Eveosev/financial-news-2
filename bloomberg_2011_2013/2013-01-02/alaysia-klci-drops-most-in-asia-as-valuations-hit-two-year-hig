Malaysia stocks fell the most in Asia
after a rally by the benchmark index to a record on the last
trading day in 2012 pushed  valuations  to a two-year high.  The  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index (FBMKLCI)  declined 0.7 percent to
1,677.01 as of 11:54 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, snapping five days of
gains. The gauge reached a new high on Dec. 31 when it advanced
0.5 percent to 1,688.95. The market was shut yesterday for a
holiday.  The KLCI Index traded at 16.04 times estimated earnings on
Dec. 31, the highest level since Dec. 31, 2010. The gauge rose
10 percent in 2012 amid speculation government infrastructure
spending will shelter the nation from  Europe ’s debt crisis and a
global economic slowdown. The index’s gain last year is its
fourth annual advance, the longest winning streak since 1989.  “It’s mainly profit taking,” Tan Lip Kwang, who helps
manage the equivalent of $1 billion at K&N Kenanga Holdings
Bhd., said by phone today. “On the last trading day last year,
in the last 10 to 15 minutes, some of the key index stocks were
pushed up drastically.”  The market gains on Dec. 31 took its 14-day  relative
strength index  to 74.5, the highest since July 20, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The RSI measures how rapidly prices
have advanced or declined during the specified time period. Some
analysts see a reading of more than 70 as a signal to sell.  Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd. (KLK)  slid 5.3 percent to 22.72 ringgit
today after its RSI hit 84.2 on Dec. 31, the highest level since
July 11.  AMMB Holdings Bhd. (AMM)  led lenders lower after  CIMB Group
Holdings Bhd. (CIMB)  analyst Winson Ng said in a report today industry
loan growth will slow this year. AMMB declined 1.6 percent to
6.69 ringgit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
