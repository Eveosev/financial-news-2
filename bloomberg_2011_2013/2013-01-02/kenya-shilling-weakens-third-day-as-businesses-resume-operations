Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a third
day, heading for a seven-month low, on increased dollar demand
as businesses resumed operations in the new year.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
0.2 percent to 86.30 per dollar by 12:30 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital. A close at this level would be the weakest since May
30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shilling is coming under pressure on increased dollar
demand as businesses resume operations,” Duncan Kinuthia, head
of trading for Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone
from Nairobi. “There are pockets of dollar-buying interest
coming into the market and with liquidity still low the shilling
may slip to 86.50 a dollar.”  Remittances by Kenyans  working overseas rose to $97.5
million in November from $80.8 million in the same month last
year, the Central Bank of Kenya said today on its  website . It
increased from $91.63 million in October, it said.  Kenya is scheduled on March 4 to hold its first national
elections since a disputed vote in 2007 sparked two months of
ethnic clashes that left more than 1,100 people dead.  “The performance of the shilling in the first half will
largely be determined by the political environment as we head
into the general elections in March,” Kinuthia said.  The central bank offered 15 billion shillings ($174
million) of seven-day repurchase agreements, a bank official who
asked not to be identified in line with policy, said by phone
today.  The Ugandan shilling weakened 0.5 percent to 2,695 a
dollar, while Tanzania’s shilling depreciated 0.6 percent to
1,594 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
