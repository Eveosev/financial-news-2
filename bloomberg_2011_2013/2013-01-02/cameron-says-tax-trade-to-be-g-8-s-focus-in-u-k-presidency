U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
told Group of Eight leaders that he’s focused on advancing
trade, ensuring tax compliance and promoting greater
transparency as Britain takes over the bloc’a yearlong
presidency.  Members of the group, scheduled to meet at Lough Erne in
 Northern Ireland  in June, won’t “simply whip out a checkbook at
the 11th hour, pledge some money and call it a success,”
Cameron said in an e-mailed statement today. “Long-term
changes” alone that can drive progress, he said.  “In 2013 the world will continue to face grave economic
uncertainty,” said in the letter to other G-8 leaders. “Our
first priority will be dealing with the challenges in our own
countries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
