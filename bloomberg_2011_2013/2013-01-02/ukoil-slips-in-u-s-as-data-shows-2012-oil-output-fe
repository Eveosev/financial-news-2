OAO Lukoil (LUKOY)  dropped in New York after
data showed Russia’s second-biggest oil producer failed to boost
domestic production last year even as the nation’s crude and
condensate output climbed to a post-Soviet record.  American depositary receipts  of Lukoil fell 0.7 percent to
$67 in New York, the biggest one-day slide since Dec. 21.
Trading volumes were more than double the daily average over the
past three months, data compiled by Bloomberg show, with the
Moscow Exchange closed for a holiday. Lukoil was the biggest
decliner on the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-
traded Russian stocks in the U.S.  Lukoil, which trails state-backed oil producer  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) 
by output, and OAO Slavneft were the only Russian oil producers
tracked by the Energy Ministry that saw production decline in
2012, data from the ministry’s CTEK unit showed. The country’s
crude and condensate production climbed 1.1 percent in 2012 from
a year ago, according to the data. Lukoil’s output fell 0.8
percent in 2012 from 2011, while Rosneft’s rose 2.6 percent.  Moscow-based Lukoil is seeking to increase production
outside of Russia and is planning new wells in  Africa , Andrei Kuzyaev, head of its overseas unit, said Dec. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
