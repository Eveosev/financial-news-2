OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, led the nation’s benchmark stock  index (MXEF)  to the highest
level in almost seven weeks after U.S. lawmakers resolved a
budget deadlock threatening the world’s largest economy.  OTP’s shares jumped 2.7 percent to 4,260 forint by the
close in Budapest, the biggest advance since Nov. 30. The BUX
index, in which OTP has a 31 percent  weighting , rose 1.7 percent
to 18,487.51, the highest since Nov. 15.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index soared 2.1 percent, the
most since September, after the House of Representatives voted
in favor of budget legislation averting spending cuts and tax
increases that had threatened to crimp growth. Hungary’s
manufacturing sector returned to contraction in December, a
purchasing manager index showed today, the latest signal that
the economy failed to emerge from recession last year.  “The key point is that the deal has been clinched and the
tightening measures which could have pulled the  U.S. economy 
into recession don’t enter into force,”  Akos Kuti , a Budapest-
based analyst at broker Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., wrote in a
report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
