Cap SA (CAP) ,  Chile ’s largest iron-ore
miner, touched the highest in seven weeks on a recovery of
prices in  China  for the raw material used to produce steel.  Cap advanced 3.5 percent to 16,620 pesos at 3:51 p.m. in
Santiago after touching 16,650, the highest intraday level since
Nov. 12. It was the best performer on the benchmark Ipsa index,
which rose 0.6 percent. The Santiago-based company is also the
country’s biggest steel producer.  “It’s all about iron-ore prices today,” Jose Manuel Edwards, an analyst at Santiago-based brokerage IM Trust SA,
said in a telephone interview. “Iron mining now accounts for
most of Cap’s gross profit as steel margins have fallen and iron
prices have been recovering.”  The price of imported  iron ore  in the Chinese port of
Tianjin has increased 25 percent in the past month to $144.90 a
dry ton, according to The Steel Index Ltd. It fell to $86.70 on
Sept. 5, the lowest since October 2009.  While iron-ore mining represented 53 percent of Cap’s
revenue in the third quarter of 2012, with steel production at
44 percent, mining of iron ore accounted for 86 percent of gross
profit versus 4 percent for steel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Cap has gained 14 percent since reaching 14,560 pesos on
Dec. 10, its lowest price in a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
