South African yellow corn futures
rose the most in more than a month after traders oversold
contracts during the Christmas holiday.  Yellow corn for July, the most active contract, advanced
2.9 percent to 2,107 rand ($249) a metric ton on the South
African Futures Exchange by the close in Johannesburg. That was
the steepest intraday climb since Nov. 26. White corn, a staple
food, gained 3.5 percent to 2,209 rand, the most since Oct. 1.  Yellow corn’s 14-day relative strength index was below 30
on Dec. 27 and Dec. 31, signaling to technical analysts that
it’s undervalued and poised to rise. The RSI was 38.7 today.  “The price decline may be too far over the public
holidays,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG (Pty) Ltd., said by
phone from  Pretoria . “The price of corn declined sharply.”  Yellow corn, mainly used as  animal feed , fell 14 percent in
December, and white corn 13 percent. Corn on the Chicago Board
of Trade slid more than 7 percent to its lowest rate since July.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn,
or maize. It harvested 11.8 million tons in the season through
July, according to the Pretoria-based  Crop Estimates Committee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
