Indian (SENSEX)  stocks advanced to a two-year
high as U.S. lawmakers passed legislation averting some
automatic tax increases and spending cuts.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose 0.6 percent
to 19,705.19, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m., its highest close since Jan. 6, 2011. Motorcycle maker
 Hero Motocorp Ltd. (HMCL)  climbed as December sales rose.  Bharat Heavy
Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , the largest Indian power-equipment maker, led
industrials higher.  The U.S. House of Representatives passed the legislation,
averting income tax increases for most U.S. workers after
Republicans abandoned efforts to attach spending cuts that would
have been rejected by the Senate. The bipartisan vote breaks a
yearlong impasse over how to head off $600 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts, or the so-called fiscal cliff.  The U.S. accounted for 11 percent of  India â€™s exports in the
six months ended September 2011, trade ministry data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
