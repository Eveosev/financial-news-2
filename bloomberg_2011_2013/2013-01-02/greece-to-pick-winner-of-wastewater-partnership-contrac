Greece will choose the winner next
month for a 27-year contract to build and operate a wastewater-
treatment plant in the northern West Macedonia region, the
Development Ministry said.  The ministry said the contract, to be partly financed by
the  European Investment Bank , will be the first wastewater-
management project awarded via the public-private partnership
process in Greece, which is undergoing an economic overhaul.  Terna Energy SA (TENERGY) , a venture of Aktor Parachorisses SA and
 Ellaktor SA (ELLAKTOR) , and a group comprising Mesogios SA,  J&P Avax SA (AVAX)  and
Polyeco SA submitted binding bids for the project on Dec. 28,
the Athens-based ministry said in a website  statement .  The sewage treatment plant will have an annual wastewater-
processing capacity of 120,000 metric tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
