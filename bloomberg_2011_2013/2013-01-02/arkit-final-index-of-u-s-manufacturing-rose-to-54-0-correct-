(Corrects December figure in first paragraph.)  The Markit Economics  final index  of
U.S. manufacturing increased to 54.0 in December from 52.8 a
month earlier, the London-based group said today.  A reading above 50 in the purchasing managers’ measure
indicates expansion. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
of economists was 53.6, with estimates ranging from 51 to 54.5.
The preliminary gauge for the month was 54.2.  Markit’s purchasers figure is based on replies from about
85 percent to 90 percent of those American manufacturers that
respond to a poll of the more than 600 companies.  The Markit gauge of U.S. manufacturing debuted in May. The
company surveys purchasing managers in more than 30 countries
and regions, including Europe and  China .  Elsewhere, U.K. manufacturing unexpectedly grew in December
at the fastest pace in 15 months. A gauge of factory activity
rose to 51.4 from a revised 49.2 in November, Markit and the
 Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said in  London 
today.  In the euro-area, manufacturing continued to shrink.
Markit’s gauge eased to 46.1 last month from 46.2 in November.
Indexes for Germany, France and Italy all remained below 50 last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
