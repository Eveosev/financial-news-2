At least 60,000 people have been
killed in fighting in  Syria  since protests against President
Bashar al-Assad began nearly two years ago, the United Nations
said in its first detailed analysis of deaths so far.  “The number of casualties is much higher than we expected,
and is truly shocking,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
Navi Pillay said in a statement e-mailed from Geneva today.  The analysis took five months to complete, and is based on
a list of reported killings that include full names, as well as
the date and location of each death. Any report containing
insufficient information was excluded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
