U.K. gilts declined, with 10-year
yields climbing to the highest in two weeks, as U.S. lawmakers
passed legislation to avert automatic spending cuts and tax
increases, reducing demand for fixed-income assets as a haven.  The declines pushed 10-year yields up by the most in four
months. The pound rose to its strongest level in 16 months
against the dollar as a report showed  manufacturing  unexpectedly
expanded at the fastest pace in 15 months in December,
indicating the economy picked up strength toward the end of
2012, reducing the chances of another recession.  “It’s largely driven by the U.S.,” said Jason Simpson, an
interest-rate strategist at Banco Santander SA in  London .
Congress has “managed to resolve a sufficient number of the key
fiscal problems. It’s not the worst-case scenario unfolding,”
he said.  The 10-year gilt yield rose 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 1.99 percent at 4:30 p.m. London time. That
was the biggest increase since Sept. 3. The 1.75 percent
security fell 1.39 or 13.90 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,630) face
amount, to 97.92. Two-year yields increased eight basis points
to 0.40 percent, the highest since May 16.  Ten-year yields may climb to 2.90 percent this year,
Simpson said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict it
will rise to 2.4 percent by the end of 2013.  Bill Passed  The pound appreciated was little changed at $1.6252, after
reaching $1.6381, the strongest level since Aug. 30, 2011.
Sterling was also little changed at 81.18 pence per euro.  The U.S. House passed a bill undoing income tax increases
for more than 99 percent of households, giving a victory to
President  Barack Obama  even as Republicans vowed to fight him in
coming weeks for spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt
ceiling. The measure was carried with a 257-167  vote .  A gauge of British  factory activity  rose to 51.4 from a
revised 49.2 in November, Markit Economics and the Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply said in London today. The
median forecast of 29 economists in a Bloomberg News  survey  was
for a reading of 49.1, unchanged from November’s initially
reported level. A reading above 50 indicates growth.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index for the U.K. has recovered
from a three-month low of 47.3 in October. A report tomorrow
will show construction improved in December even as the gauge
stayed below the 50 level that marks expansion, according to a
survey of economists.  “If the global backdrop continues to improve then the
pound will benefit,” said Neil Jones, head of European hedge
fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. “The U.K.
data is also a feature and the PMI number is encouraging.”  Sterling has gained 1.9 percent in the past 12 months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The euro declined 1.1 percent
and the dollar fell 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
