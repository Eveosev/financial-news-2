Canadian  stocks  rose, sending the
benchmark index toward the highest closing level in nine months,
as commodities surged after U.S. lawmakers passed a bill
averting spending cuts and tax increases.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  and Suncor Energy Inc.
added at least 1.5 percent as crude climbed to its highest in
three months. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer
of the metal, gained 1 percent as gold rallied to a two-week
high. Royal Bank of Canada, the nation’s largest lender, climbed
1.1 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 134.65
points, or 1.1 percent, to 12,568.18 at 9:54 a.m. in Toronto. A
close at that level would be the highest since March.  The U.S. House passed a bill undoing income tax increases
for more than 99 percent of households. The 257-167 bipartisan
vote breaks a yearlong impasse over how to head off $600 billion
in tax increases and spending cuts that would have started
taking effect yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
