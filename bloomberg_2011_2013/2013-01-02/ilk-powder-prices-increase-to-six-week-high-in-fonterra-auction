Whole-milk powder prices rose in the
latest auction after declining in the four previous sales, said
 Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. (FCG)   Powder for March delivery rose 1.9 percent, according to a
trade-weighted index on the company’s  GlobalDairyTrade  website.
The near-term contract for  New Zealand  product rose to $3,183 a
metric ton, the highest price since Nov. 20.  Fonterra in December raised its forecast payment to
farmers, saying it expects higher global dairy prices in the
first half of 2013. While milk prices fell toward year-end as
new season output from New Zealand and other southern hemisphere
producers entered the market, they are 25 percent higher than in
mid-July after the worst U.S. drought in 56 years curbed supply.  The Auckland-based company, which accounts for about 40
percent of the global trade in dairy products, sells whole, skim
and butter-milk powder, dried-milk fat, lactose, cheese and
casein at its GlobalDairyTrade auctions. It offers monthly
contracts with delivery starting from two months after the sale.
Casein is a protein found in milk.  Whole-milk powder for April delivery rose 1.7% while prices
across all five product contracts out to July rose 1.6 percent,
Fonterra said.  In other auctions, prices for March delivery of butter and
skim milk powder and milk protein concentrate also rose. Milk
fat, cheddar and casein fell. Lactose wasn’t offered in the
sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
