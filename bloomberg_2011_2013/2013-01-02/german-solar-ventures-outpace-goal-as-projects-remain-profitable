German developers added a record
number of solar panels in the first 11 months of last year, more
than double the quantity targeted by the government.  Solar installations rose 62 percent to about 7,274
megawatts from January through November, compared with about
4,502 megawatts a year earlier, according to  data  from federal
grid regulator Bundesnetzagentur. The government had sought to
limit capacity additions to a maximum of 3,500 megawatts.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  has cut solar-power subsidies to
reduce the burden on consumer electricity bills of  Germany ’s
renewable-energy expansion. Still, the above-market tariffs
remain at levels that allow developers to profit, while
component prices have continued to drop amid an oversupply.  Environment Minister  Peter Altmaier  plans to propose
changes to the renewables subsidy system in March to prevent a
voter backlash against rising energy costs before an election in
the autumn. Subsidies in 2013 will amount to about 20.4 billion
euros ($27 billion), paid for through consumers’ power bills.  There are signs that solar installations have been slowing
recently. Germany added 435 megawatts of panels in November,
down from 659 megawatts a year earlier, the regulator said.  Solar installations may top 8,000 megawatts for 2012,
Altmaier said in November. That compares with about 7,500
megawatts a year earlier, when developers added about 3,000
megawatts in December to beat subsidy cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
