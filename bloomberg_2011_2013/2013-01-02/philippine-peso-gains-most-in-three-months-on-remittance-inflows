The Philippine peso rose the most in
more than three months on speculation overseas remittances
picked up during the holiday period.  Government bonds  gained.  Funds sent home by Filipinos overseas, which make up about
10 percent of the Philippine economy, grew 5.8 percent from a
year earlier to $17.5 billion in the 10 months through October,
official data show. The peso appreciated 6.8 percent last year,
its best performance since 2007. Local financial markets were
shut Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 for the New Year holidays.  “This is the normal build-up of dollar supply over the
long weekend from overseas remittances that have been converted
into pesos,” said Joey Cuyegkeng, an economist in  Manila  at ING
Groep NV.  The peso strengthened 0.5 percent to 40.853 per dollar at
the close in Manila from Dec. 28, the biggest gain since Sept.
14, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate
used to price options, fell 20 basis points, or 0.2 percentage
point, to 4.3 percent.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index gained 0.2 percent
today after the U.S. House approved a bill averting income tax
increases for more than 99 percent of households, which could
have triggered a recession in the world’s largest economy. The
passage is a victory to President  Barack Obama  even as
Republicans vowed to fight him in coming weeks for spending cuts
in exchange for raising the debt ceiling.  The yield on the  Philippines ’ 6.125 percent bonds due
October 2037 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 5.57 percent, according to prices from Tradition Financial
Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
