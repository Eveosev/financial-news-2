Chile ’s peso advanced the most in six
weeks as U.S. politicians agreed to avoid automatic tax
increases that would have threatened the recovery of the second-
biggest buyer of the South American nation’s exports.  The peso appreciated 0.7 percent to 475.55 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:35 a.m. in Santiago, the biggest gain on a closing basis
since Nov. 19. The currency appreciated 8.4 percent in 2012.  Copper, Chile’s biggest export, advanced to a three-week
high as President  Barack Obama  said he will sign into law a
congressional bill undoing tax increases for more than 99
percent of households.  “We now know there’ll be a deal in the U.S., and that
means the uncertainty has diminished, so the  exchange rate  is
falling,” said Sebastian Senzacqua, an economist at Bice
Inversiones in Santiago, referring to reduced demand for the
dollar as a refuge.  Evidence of strength in China supported copper, Senzacqua
said. Chinese manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in 19
months in December, according to data published by HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics on Dec. 31. China and the U.S. are the
biggest buyers of Chile’s exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
