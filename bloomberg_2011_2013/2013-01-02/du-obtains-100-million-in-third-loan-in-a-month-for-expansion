Du (DU)  obtained a $100 million loan, the
third financing facility the Dubai-based phone operator raised
in a month as it seeks funding for expansion in the  United Arab
Emirates . The shares climbed.  The loan from Standard Chartered Plc will “optimize
liquidity levels and allow us to fund both short and medium term
capital expenditure,” Chief Executive Officer Osman Sultan said
in a  statement  today. Shares of the company, also known as
Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Co., gained 1.4 percent
to 3.54 dirhams at the close in Dubai.  Du in December obtained a $500 million club facility from
 National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC  after earlier that month
securing a $100 million loan from DBS Bank. Du competes with
 Emirates Telecommunications Corp. (ETISALAT) , also known as Etisalat,
gaining about 47 percent of mobile-phone market share in the
second-biggest Arab economy since it started operations five
years ago.  The company, which has been focused on its home market
since operations began in 2007, said in May it is open to
expansion outside the U.A.E. Du will probably post a 44 percent
increase in 2012 profit to 1.58 billion dirhams ($430 million),
according to the average estimate of nine analysts on Bloomberg.  Du shares  gained 21 percent last year, outpacing an advance
of 20 percent for the benchmark DFM General Index. The stock
fell 8.6 percent in December in the first monthly decline since
May after the U.A.E. raised fees for the use of government
facilities. The company has a market value of 16.2 billion
dirhams, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
