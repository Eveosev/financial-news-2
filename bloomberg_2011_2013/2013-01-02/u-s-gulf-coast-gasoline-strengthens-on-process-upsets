Gasoline gained on the U.S. Gulf
Coast after a process upset at  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Borger refinery and
as a unit of  Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ) ’s Big Spring plant is shut for
repair.  Phillips 66 routed emissions to control a device after a
process upset at its 146,000-barrel-a-day Borger, Texas,
refinery, the company reported Dec. 31. Alon shut a fluid
catalytic cracker at its  Big Spring refinery  to repair a leak at
the unit, according to a filing with the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality.  Reformulated gasoline to be blended with ethanol in the
Gulf gained 3.37 cents to 7.13 cents a gallon below futures on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:06 p.m. Conventional
gasoline added 2.5 cents to  13 cents  below futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the region gained 0.62 cent to
3.38 cents below heating oil futures.  The two refineries can process a combined 216,000 barrels a
day, or about 2.5 percent of total U.S. Gulf Coast capacity.
Inventories of motor fuel in the region were 81.3 million
barrels, the Energy Department reported last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
