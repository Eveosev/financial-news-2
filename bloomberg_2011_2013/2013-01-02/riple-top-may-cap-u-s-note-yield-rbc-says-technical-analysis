The selloff that sent Treasury  10-
year note yields  up the most since October after U.S. lawmakers
passed a bill averting spending cuts and tax increases may face
resistance, according to Royal Bank of  Canada .  The benchmark yield is close to a so-called triple top, a
chart pattern where a price creates three peaks close to the
same level. Ten-year note yields have failed to rise above peaks
of 1.86 percent and 1.89 percent during the past year.  “If we fail to break the 1.89 level, we will see support
for Treasuries,” said  George Davis , chief technical analyst for
fixed-income in Toronto at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital
Markets unit. “If we break through, the risk-sentiment trade
will rule the day.”  Benchmark 10-year yields rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 1.83 percent in New York time, based on
Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The yield gained as much as nine
basis points, the steepest advance since Oct. 17, and reached
the highest level since Oct. 25.  Congress passed legislation averting income-tax increases
for more than 99 percent of households, breaking an impasse over
how to avert the so-called fiscal cliff. Lawmakers must next
tackle the U.S. debt ceiling, which reached its $16.4 trillion
limit on Dec. 31.  The 10-year yield is forecast to climb to 2.2 percent at
the end of the year, according to the median estimates of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
