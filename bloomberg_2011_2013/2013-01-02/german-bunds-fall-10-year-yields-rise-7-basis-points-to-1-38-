German  government bonds  declined
after U.S. lawmakers passed a bill that averted spending cuts
and tax increases threatening the worldâ€™s largest economy,
damping demand for the safest assets.  Yields rose as the U.S. House passed a bill undoing income
tax increases for more than 99 percent of households, giving a
victory to President  Barack Obama  even as Republicans vowed to
fight him in coming weeks for spending cuts in exchange for
raising the debt ceiling.  Benchmark 10-year bund yields climbed seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 1.38 percent at 7:32 a.m. London
time. Two-year note yields advanced two basis points to zero
percent.  German bonds returned 4.5 percent last year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
