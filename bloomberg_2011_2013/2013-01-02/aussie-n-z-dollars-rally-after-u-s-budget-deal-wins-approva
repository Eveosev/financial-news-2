The Australian and New Zealand
dollars climbed against their U.S. counterpart after lawmakers
in Washington passed a budget bill to avert the so-called fiscal
cliff threatening the world’s biggest economy.  Australia’s currency rose against most of its major peers,
touching its strongest level in two weeks, as the budget deal
spurred demand for riskier assets. The  New Zealand dollar  also
reached a two-week high even as Republicans vowed to fight
President  Barack Obama  for spending cuts in exchange for raising
the U.S. debt ceiling.  The Aussie “advanced on relief after American lawmakers
reached a last-minute deal to stave off the worst of the fiscal-
cliff measures of tax increases and spending cuts,”  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst in Washington at Western Union
Business Solutions, a unit of Western Union Co., wrote yesterday
in a note to clients.  The Australian currency appreciated 1.1 percent to $1.0504
yesterday in  New York  after advancing as much as 1.2 percent,
its biggest increase since June 29, to $1.0524, the strongest
level since Dec. 19. It gained 1.8 percent to 91.74 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, added 0.8 percent
to 83.41 U.S. cents and touched 83.97 cents, the highest since
Dec. 19. The kiwi climbed as much as 1.9 percent to 73.13 yen,
the strongest level since September 2008.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of raw materials rose 0.9
percent, and the  S&P 500 Index  surged 2.5 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar strengthened 4.4 percent over the past
year, the biggest increase after Norway’s krone among 10
developed-nation currencies monitored by the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The Aussie fell 0.5 percent, and
the  U.S. dollar  slid 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
