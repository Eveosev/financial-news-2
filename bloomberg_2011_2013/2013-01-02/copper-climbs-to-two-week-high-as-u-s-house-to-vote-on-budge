Copper and nickel led a rally in base
metals after the  House of Representatives  approved a bill to
avert tax gains for most U.S. workers, boosting the outlook for
demand. Lead gained to the highest level in more than 15 months
in  London  and zinc climbed to the most expensive since October.  Copper for delivery in three months climbed as much as 2
percent to $8,090 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
equaling the Dec. 18 high, and was at $8,081.75 at 3:58 p.m. in
 Seoul . Lead rose as much as 1.4 percent to $2,362 a ton, the
most expensive since September 2011, and was at $2,361.50.  The 257-167 bipartisan vote in the House breaks a yearlong
impasse over how to head off $600 billion in automatic tax rises
and spending cuts, which kicked in from Jan. 1. The Senate had
passed the bill earlier and it now goes to President  Barack
Obama , who said he will sign it. The dollar declined and
commodities climbed, including crude oil and precious metals.  “Copper is extending gains after the bill was passed,”
said Hwang Il Doo, a senior metals trader at Seoul-based Korea
Exchange Bank Futures Co. The metal “will be able to keep the
momentum for the time being. At the same time, data out of China
show the economy is expanding.”  A gauge of China’s manufacturing showed a third month of
expansion, adding to evidence that the economic recovery in the
top copper consumer will extend into 2013. The  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index was 50.6 in December, the National Bureau of
Statistics and  China  Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
yesterday. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Copper for delivery in March rose as much as 0.9 percent to
$3.6835 a pound on the Comex in  New York , and was at $3.678. On
the LME, zinc climbed as much as 1.5 percent to $2,111.50 a ton,
the highest since Oct. 2, and was $2,108, while aluminum, tin
and lead gained. Markets in China are closed for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
