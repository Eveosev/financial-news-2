The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars fell to a 3 1/2-month low after Congress passed a
budget bill that avoids a threat to the recovery in the U.S.
economy.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 19 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 12:45 p.m. in
London, the cheapest since Sept. 17, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The cost has fallen from minus 27 basis points on
Dec. 26.  U.S. lawmakers passed legislation averting tax increases
and spending cuts due to kick in from the start of the year that
could lead to a recession. In  Europe , credit rallied after
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti said Dec. 29 he will lead a
coalition in the country’s elections next month.  “The move fits with the general risk-on momentum,” said
 Christoph Rieger , head of fixed-rate strategy at Commerzbank AG
in  Frankfurt . “The fiscal cliff agreement and domestic events
in Europe, such as Monti signaling his willingness to seek
another term, help dollar capital move back into Europe.”  The one-year basis swap was 23 basis points below Euribor,
the lowest cost to swap since June 2011, from minus 24
yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Dollar Auction  European lenders bid for $980 million at the European
Central Bank’s seven-day dollar facility auction today, compared
with $600 million at the 14-day auction on Dec. 19, and $3.26
billion in the seven-day auction on Dec. 12, data compiled by
Bloomberg shows.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another was little changed. The difference between
Euribor and overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-OIS
spread, was 12.2 basis points.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they see each other
lending at in euros, was set at 0.188 percent from 0.187 percent
yesterday. The benchmark is derived from a daily survey of banks
for the European Banking Federation.  Lenders increased overnight  deposits  at the European
Central Bank yesterday to 280 billion euros ($371 billion) from
262 billion euros on Dec. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
