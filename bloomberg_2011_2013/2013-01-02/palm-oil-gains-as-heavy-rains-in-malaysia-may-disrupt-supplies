Palm oil  advanced to the highest
level in two months on speculation that rainfall and flooding
may hamper harvesting in  Malaysia , helping to draw down record
stockpiles in the second-largest producer.  The contract for March delivery jumped 2.6 percent to 2,501
ringgit ($824) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the highest settlement price for the most-active
contract since Nov. 1. Futures lost 23 percent last year as
inventories in Malaysia expanded.  A so-called heavy-rain warning was issued on Dec. 31 for
several districts in Terengganu and Pahang, according to a
 statement  from the Malaysian Meteorological Department. The rain
was expected to persist until today and cause floods, the
department said. The two states accounted for about 18 percent
of the country’s total crude palm oil output from January to
November last year, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil  Board .  “That’s going to cause a disruption in the supply and also
a disruption in the harvesting progress,” Ker Chung Yang, an
analyst at Phillip Futures Pte, said from  Singapore . “We are
likely to see the stockpiles subside.”  Commodities from oil to copper rallied today after the  U.S.
Congress  passed a bill that averted spending cuts and tax gains
threatening a recovery in the world’s biggest economy.  Palm oil  inventories  in November reached 2.56 million tons,
according to the palm oil board, which is scheduled to release
data for December on Jan. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
