The  Bovespa (IBOV)  index rose to an eight-
month high as a rally in commodities prices bolstered the
outlook for  Brazil ’s biggest companies.  Iron-ore producer  Vale SA (VALE)  and oil company  OGX Petroleo e
Gas Participacoes SA  contributed the most to the gauge’s
advance. Homebuilder  MRV Engenharia e Participacoes SA (MRVE3)  slumped
after saying a subsidiary was included in a list of companies
that the government says keeps workers in slave-like conditions.  The Bovespa rose 2.6 percent to 62,550.10, the highest
closing level since April 19. The real rose 0.3 percent to
2.0457 per U.S. dollar. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24
raw materials rallied 0.8 percent and oil climbed to the highest
level in three months after U.S. lawmakers passed a bill that
averted spending cuts and tax gains that threatened the world’s
biggest economy.  “With this deal, the country should grow more this year,
and that’s very good for Brazil as well because the U.S. is one
of its main trading partners,” Felipe Rocha, an analyst at
brokerage Omar Camargo, said by phone from Curitiba, Brazil.  Vale, the world’s largest iron-ore miner, added 4.2 percent
to 42.60 reais, the highest closing price since April 13. OGX,
billionaire  Eike Batista ’s oil company, jumped 8.7 percent to
4.76 reais.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR) , the state-controlled oil company,
jumped 0.9 percent to 19.69 reais.  U.S. Deal  The legislation passed the U.S. House of Representatives by
a vote of 257-167 after 11 p.m. yesterday in  Washington , capping
a tension-filled final push as Republicans balked at the
bipartisan Senate bill.  MRV fell 2.8 percent to 11.65 reais. The homebuilder was
included in a Labor Ministry list of companies that the
government says keep workers in degrading or slave-like
conditions. MRV is taking measures to be excluded from the list,
the company said in a statement.  The Bovespa climbed 7.4 percent last year in its biggest
annual rally since 2009 as stimulus from central banks around
the world eased economic concern, while borrowing costs at a
record low in Brazil boosted demand for stocks.  Trading volume was 7.3 billion reais in stocks in Sao Paulo
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares
with 5.9 billion reais on Dec. 28, according to data compiled by
the  exchange . Brazilian markets were closed on Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
