Ukraineâ€™s winter grains emerged on 96
percent of the planted area after more crops sprouted in
southern regions in late December, according to UkrAgroConsult.  Winter grains emerged on 7.78 million hectares (19.2
million acres), the Kiev-based researcher said today in an e-
mailed note. About 62 percent of emerged crops were in good
condition and almost 30 percent were deemed to be in a
satisfactory state, the researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
