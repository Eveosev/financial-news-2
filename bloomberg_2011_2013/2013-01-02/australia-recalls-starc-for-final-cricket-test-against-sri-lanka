Australia  recalled Mitchell Starc to
a four-man fast bowling attack as it seeks to sweep Sri Lanka in
their three-match Test cricket series.  Starc will form part of a pace quartet with Peter Siddle,
Mitchell Johnson and Jackson Bird in the third Test starting
tomorrow at the Sydney Cricket Ground, captain Michael Clarke
said. Off-spinnning allrounder Glenn Maxwell was denied his Test
debut after being named as the 12th man.  Wicketkeeper Matthew Wade will bat at No. 6, while Johnson
will fill the all-rounderâ€™s role in the absence of the injured
Shane Watson.  Australia took an unbeatable 2-0 series lead by routing Sri
Lanka by an innings and 201 runs last week.  AUSTRALIA:  Ed Cowan , David Warner, Phil Hughes, Michael
Clarke (captain), Mike Hussey, Matthew Wade, Mitchell Johnson,
 Peter Siddle , Nathan Lyon, Jackson Bird, Mitchell Starc.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
