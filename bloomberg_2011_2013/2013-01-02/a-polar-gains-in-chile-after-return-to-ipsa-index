Empresas La Polar SA (NUEVAPOL) , the Chilean
department-store operator that plunged 91 percent in 2011 after
the discovery of accounting irregularities, rallied after
returning to the country’s benchmark stock index.  La Polar rose 2.5 percent to 211 pesos at 10:59 a.m. in
Santiago, and earlier rose 3.7 percent, the most in three weeks
on an intraday basis. The shares are still down 94 percent since
peaking in September 2010.  “It’s positive for the stock as there are foreign funds
that invest only among members of the index,” Gian Bonino, an
analyst at Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA, said in a
telephone interview today from Santiago. “La Polar showed up as
a new possible member of the Ipsa in our simulations, but it
seems to have taken the rest of the market by surprise.”  La Polar revealed in 2011 that previous management had
unilaterally been restructuring terms of clients’ past-due loans
as a way to cap loss provisions and boost profits. The
announcement forced the company to book a loss of 583 billion
pesos ($1.2 billion) in 2011 and led to the dismissal and trial
of some former managers. La Polar was dropped from the Ipsa
index that year.  Current management, led by Chairman Cesar Barros and Chief
Executive Officer Patricio Lecaros, restructured terms of $1.1
billion of debt and sold 133 billion pesos in new shares to
shore up La Polar’s finances. The company seeks to reach full-
year revenue of 462 billion pesos by 2014, Lecaros told
reporters in September. The retailer had revenue of 259 billion
pesos in the first nine months of 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
