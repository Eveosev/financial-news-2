Dole Food Co. (DOLE) , the world’s largest
marketer of fresh produce, fell the most on record after the
company said profit from its fruit unit is declining.  Dole fell 13 percent to $9.93 at the close in New York, the
biggest decline since its October 2009 initial public offering.  Dole expects to report earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization of $150 million to $170 million
this year, the  Westlake Village , California-based company said
today in a statement.  “The fresh fruit business of the new Dole is continuing to
experience declining earnings,” General Counsel C. Michael Carter said in the statement. The company is facing “aggressive
contract negotiations in the North American banana market even
though costs are higher.”  Today’s forecast includes the $1.69 billion sale of its
Asia fresh fruit and global packaged-food businesses to  Itochu
Corp. (8001) , which is expected to close “in early 2013,” according
to the statement.  Chairman David Murdock, who was chief executive officer
from 1985 to 2007, will return to that post to lead Dole’s focus
on  North America  and Europe and Carter will become president.  Jonathan Feeney, a Philadelphia-based analyst at Janney
Montgomery Scott who rates the shares buy, cut his estimate for
2013 Ebitda to $151 million from $206 million, in a research
note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
