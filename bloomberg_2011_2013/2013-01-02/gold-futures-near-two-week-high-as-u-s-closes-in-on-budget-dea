Gold futures rose to a two-week high
as commodities gained after U.S. lawmakers passed a budget
accord. Palladium advanced to the costliest in 10 months, and
silver jumped the most in eight weeks.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24  raw materials 
gained as much as 1.6 percent after the  House of Representatives 
approved a bill that prevents income taxes from rising for most
U.S. workers. Industrial metals also jumped, while equities
rallied.  “Markets reacted positively to news that a deal of sorts
has been reached,” Steve Scacalossi, a New York-based vice
president at TD Securities Inc., said in an e-mail.  Gold futures for February delivery rose 0.8 percent to
settle at $1,688.80 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price reached $1,695.40, the highest for a
most-active contract since Dec. 18. Floor trading was closed
yesterday for the New Year’s holiday.  In 2012, the metal gained 7 percent, advancing for the 12th
straight year, as central banks from the U.S. to  China  pledged
more steps to bolster their economies.  President  Barack Obama  said he will sign the bill passed by
Congress that makes the George W. Bush-era income tax cuts
permanent for most workers while letting them expire for top
earners.  The bipartisan vote in the House broke a yearlong impasse
over how to head off $600 billion in tax increases and spending
reductions that had been set to begin taking effect at the start
of this year. Those measures may have triggered a recession, the
 Congressional Budget Office  said.  Palladium futures for March delivery rose 0.7 percent to
$707.95 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Earlier,
the price reached $718.85, the highest since March 2.  Silver futures for March delivery surged 2.6 percent to
$31.007 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest increase since Nov.
6.  Platinum futures for April delivery gained 1.7 percent to
$1,568 an ounce on the Nymex, the biggest gain since Nov. 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
