Polish electricity  for tomorrow rose
for a second day amid delayed starts of power plants and
increased exports.  Next-day power gained 0.6 percent to 146.78 zloty ($47.75)
a megawatt-hour, exchange data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)  and Enea SA delayed starts of
power units with a combined capacity of 925 megawatts that were
initially expected to supply electricity tomorrow, data from the
power grid manager PSE Operator SA showed. Poland was set to
become a net exporter, sending a maximum of 546 megawatts to
Germany during peak evening hours tomorrow. That compares with
no exports at the same time today, the data showed.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic  and Slovakia added 0.5 percent to 35.17 euros ($46.59)
a megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countriesâ€™
 market operators . Hungarian day-ahead power jumped 29 percent to
46 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
