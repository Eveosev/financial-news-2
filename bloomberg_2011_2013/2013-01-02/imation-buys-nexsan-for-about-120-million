Imation Corp. (IMN) , the technology company
spun off from 3M Co. in 1996, acquired Nexsan Corp. for about
$120 million, adding disk-storage products to its lineup and
providing more access to small and mid-sized businesses.  Imation will pay about $105 million in cash, as well as
stock worth approximately $15 million, the Oakdale, Minnesota-
based company said today in a statement. Nexsan, a closely held
company in  Thousand Oaks ,  California , has more than 11,000
customers, Imation said.  The deal is part of a comeback plan for Imation, which is
projected to report its sixth straight year of net losses and
fourth consecutive annual decline. The company is trying to
rebound by finding higher-growth markets in data storage and
security. Nexsan, which will add about 200 employees to Imation,
had $82 million in 2011 revenue.  “Nexsan’s management team has grown this business from
startup to more than $80 million, with strong gross margins,”
Imation Chief Executive Officer Mark Lucas said in the
statement. “The combination of Nexsan’s products, technologies,
and talented teams with Imation’s global reach and
infrastructure will be an excellent accelerator for our growth
strategy in storage solutions.”  Imation shares rose 5.2 percent on Dec. 31, the most recent
trading day. The stock fell more than 18 percent last year,
following a 44 percent drop in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
