Bovespa (IBOV)  stock-index futures jumped
for a second day as higher commodities prices bolstered the
outlook for Brazil’s biggest companies.  Iron-ore producer  Vale SA (VALE)  and oil company  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PBR) , the two heaviest-weighted stocks on the Bovespa
index, gained in Frankfurt trading. Homebuilder  MRV Engenharia e
Participacoes SA  may move after saying a subsidiary was included
in a government list of companies with illegal labor practices.  Bovespa futures rose 2.3 percent to 62,675 at 9:23 a.m. in
Sao Paulo. The real fell 0.6 percent to 2.0384 per U.S. dollar.
The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials rallied 0.7
percent and oil advanced to the highest level in more than 10
weeks in  New York  after U.S. lawmakers passed a bill that
averted spending cuts and tax gains threatening a recovery in
the world’s biggest economy.  The Bovespa climbed 7.4 percent in 2012 in its biggest
yearly rally since 2009 as stimulus from central banks around
the world eased economic concern and borrowing costs at a record
low in Brazil boosted equity demand.  Trading volume was 5.9 billion reais ($2.9 billion) in
stocks in Sao Paulo on Dec. 28, which compares with a daily
average of 7.3 billion reais this year through that same day,
according to data compiled by the  exchange . Brazilian markets
were closed on Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
