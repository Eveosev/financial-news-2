The forint weakened for a third day
as data showed Hungarian manufacturing shrank the most in eight
months in December.  Hungary ’s currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 292.87 per
euro by 10:30 a.m. in Budapest. Yields on the government’s
benchmark 10-year bonds fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 6.16 percent, the lowest level since
October 2005.  A purchasing-managers index as reported by 100
manufacturing companies fell to 48.9 points last month, the
lowest reading since April, from a revised 52.1 points in
November, MLBKT, the company which compiles the data, said in a
report today. The forint gained at the end of last week after
data showed Hungary’s current-account surplus widened more than
analysts expected in the third quarter.  “The forint has been supported by favorable external
balances but that is caused by reasons which don’t bolster
growth, such as weak domestic consumption and investment
demand,” Gergely Palffy and Balint Torok, Budapest-based
analysts at Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt., wrote in a research report
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
