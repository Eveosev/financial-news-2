Pure Technologies Ltd. (PUR) , a Calgary-
based pipeline-inspection company, said it won contracts with
Louisville Water Co. in  Kentucky  and Yorkâ€™s utility in Canada
for leak detection and engineering work on water pipelines.  The contracts may be worth as much as $11.4 million should
multi-year options be picked up by LWC for the water main work.
The York agreement is project work due to be done by the third
quarter and valued at $1.2 million, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
