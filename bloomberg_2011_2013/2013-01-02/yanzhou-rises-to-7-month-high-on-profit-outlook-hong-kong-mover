Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (1171) ,  China ’s
fourth-biggest producer, rose to the highest in more than seven
months in Hong Kong on the prospect of improved earnings as
coking coal prices increase.  The stock rose 7.5 percent to HK$13.78, the highest since
May 15, at the close. The city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index
gained 2.9 percent. China’s stock markets were closed for a
holiday.  Yanzhou Coal, which posted a net loss of 79.6 million  yuan 
($12.7 million) in the third quarter because of a fall in coal
prices and a gain in selling costs, may have improved its
financial performance in the three months to December as supply
disruptions in Asia drive up prices, said Helen Lau, an analyst
at UOB Kay-Hian Ltd.  “Logistic disruption caused by the snow storm in North
China,  Russia  and Mongolia has caused tightness in coking coal
supplies,” Lau said. “Rising steel prices and iron ore prices
in China are also factors that could drive coking coal prices
higher in the near term.”  China Shenhua Energy Co. (1088) , the country’s biggest coal
producer, rose 4 percent to HK$35.30, and  China Coal Energy (1898)  Co.,
the second largest, rose 4.6 percent to HK$8.81.  A recovery in Chinese manufacturing is also lifting the
outlook for coal producers, Lau said.  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index was 50.6 in December,
the National  Bureau of Statistics  and China Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing said on Jan. 1 in Beijing. The index
stayed above 50, a reading that indicates expansion, for the
third consecutive month.  “The recovery in industrial activity is definitely good
news for coal producers as higher demand usually drives up coal
prices,” Lau said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
