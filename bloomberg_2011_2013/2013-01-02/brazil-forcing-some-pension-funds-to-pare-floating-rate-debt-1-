Brazil  is forcing some retirement
funds that hold about 300 billion reais ($147 billion) in assets
to shift some of their holdings away from floating rate bonds as
the government steps up efforts to create demand for longer term
debt.  The so-called open retirement funds, which are private
pension plans not associated with a specific company, will have
until December 2015 to comply with the new requirements that
seek to reduce the weight of floating rate debt holdings,
Economic Policy Deputy Secretary Pablo Fonseca said. The funds
held 60 percent of their assets in floating rate debt as of
March 2012, he said.  The government is implementing measures to foster local
long-term debt markets by weaning investors off shorter-term
securities and bonds linked to the overnight rate, a legacy of
the hyperinflation of the 1990s.  “The measure will lead to a reduction of short term debt
in the portfolios,” Fonseca told reporters in Brasilia. “Now
is the moment to coordinate changes in the regulation that will
lead to an extension” of maturity.  The government is also setting minimum duration
requirements for the so-called open pension funds’ portfolios,
he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
