Beijing residents were warned to
brace for more arctic weather after the city recorded its
coldest temperature for New Year’s day in three decades, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported.  The Beijing Municipal Meteorological Observatory issued the
warning after forecasting the city would record an average
temperature of minus 3 degrees Celsius (26.6 degrees Fahrenheit)
from yesterday through tomorrow, Xinhua reported on its website.  Cold winds from the north will push temperatures in the
city as low as minus 15 degrees Celsius through tomorrow, Xinhua
reported, citing the observatory.  City residents should “pay attention and take preventive
measures against the arctic cold,” Xinhua reported.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
