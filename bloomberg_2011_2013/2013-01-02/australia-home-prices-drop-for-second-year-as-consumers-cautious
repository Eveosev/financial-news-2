Australian  home prices  fell for the
second-straight year as sluggish consumer sentiment dented the
impact of interest rate cuts.  House and apartment prices  across the nation’s eight state
and territory capitals fell 0.4 percent in the 12 months to Dec.
31, according to the RP Data-Rismark home value  index , after a
3.8 percent decline in 2011. Prices are expected to rise in
2013, with increases constrained to levels between inflation and
wage growth, RP Data said.  “It is clear that the previous strong value growth
conditions to which many home owners became accustomed of recent
years are well and truly behind us,” Cameron Kusher, senior
research analyst at RP Data, said in the release.  The effect of  interest rate  reductions to match a half-
century low of 3 percent has been dented by weak consumer
sentiment and concerns about the global economy. Consumer prices
will rise 2 percent to 3 percent in the year to Dec. 31,
according to  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  forecasts.  Melbourne  had the biggest home price declines last year,
falling 2.9 percent, the Brisbane-based researcher said in an e-
mailed release. Darwin was the best performer, surging 8.9
percent, it said.  Apartment prices in the eight cities rose 0.5 percent in
2012, while values of detached houses fell 0.5 percent, RP Data
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
