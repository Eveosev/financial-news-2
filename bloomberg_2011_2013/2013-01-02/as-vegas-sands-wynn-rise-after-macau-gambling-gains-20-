Las Vegas  Sands Corp.,  Wynn Resorts
Ltd. (WYNN)  and  Melco Crown (MPEL)  Entertainment Ltd. rose in New York trading
yesterday after gambling revenue in Macau increased almost 20
percent to a record in December from a year earlier.  Las Vegas Sands  gained  5.6 percent to close at $48.75 in
New York, the biggest jump since Nov. 30. Wynn Resorts, also
based in Las Vegas, added 5 percent to $118.07, the biggest
increase since Oct. 25. Hong Kong-based Melco Crown’s American
depositary receipts advanced 3.1 percent to $17.36. Each ADR
represents three shares.  Casino revenue in the Chinese city jumped to 28.2 billion
patacas ($3.5 billion) in December, trumping a record 27.7
billion patacas in October. Full-year revenue increased 14
percent to 304 billion patacas, also a record, from 268 billion
patacas in 2011,  according  to data from Macau’s Gaming
Inspection and Coordination Bureau yesterday.  Macau authorities were expecting 800,000 border crossings
from Jan. 1-3 for the New Year’s holiday, Union Gaming analyst
Grant Govertsen said in a report.  Gambling revenue is climbing as operators, including  Sands
China Ltd. (1928) ,  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  and Melco Crown,
expand in the only place in China where casinos are legal.
Middle-class Chinese tourists have helped fuel growth even as
high-stake bettors have cut spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
