Derek Jeter  was included at
shortstop in the  New York  Yankeesâ€™ lineup to face the Tampa Bay
Rays at Yankee Stadium today.  Jeter was out from the start of the Major League Baseball
season until July 11 while recovering from a fractured left
ankle. He was injured in his first game back -- suffering a
thigh strain while running the bases.  The Yankees lost the first two games against Tampa Bay to
drop to 54-50, eight games behind the Rays (62-42), who lead the
American League East by a half-game from the Boston Red Sox. The
Baltimore Orioles (58-47) are third.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
