Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
declined the most in six weeks in  Tel Aviv  trading after a U.S.
court invalidated a 2015 patent for the top-selling Copaxone
medicine.  The shares fell 1.8 percent, the biggest decline since June
13, to 144.1 shekels ($40.23) at the close in Tel Aviv. The
Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva’s more-actively traded American
depositary receipts  fell  53 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $40.73 at
the close in  New York  trading on July 26.  Momenta
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA) , which is developing a generic version of
the multiple sclerosis drug with Novartis AG’s Sandoz, jumped 12
percent to $17.34.  “Copaxone is by far Teva’s biggest asset,” said Gilad Alper, a senior analyst at Tel Aviv-based Excellence Nessuah
Brokerage Ltd. “If competition starts as early as May 2014,
this will surely have a detrimental impact on Teva’s revenue and
profit. It still remains to be seen how soon competitive
products will actually penetrate the market, depending on the
FDA’s decision and on a Teva appeal.”  The court decision means patent protection for Teva’s
Copaxone, which makes up about 40 percent of the MS market, may
prevent generic entrants such as Momenta from selling cheaper
copies of the injection until next year rather than through
2015. While four patents that expire in May 2014 were  upheld  by
the  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit in  Washington ,
other patent claims expiring in September 2015 were invalidated.  Teva said it will appeal the decision. The company can ask
that the case be heard before all active judges or seek review
before the U.S. Supreme Court. Copaxone, Teva’s largest branded
medicine, generated $1.1 billion in sales in the first quarter
for the company and accounted for almost a fifth of its revenue
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
