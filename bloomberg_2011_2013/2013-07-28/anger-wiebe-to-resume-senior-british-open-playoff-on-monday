Mark Wiebe of the U.S. won his first
Senior British Open golf title by beating Bernhard Langer at the
fifth extra hole of a sudden-death playoff.  The men resumed their shootout at Royal Birkdale in
Southport, northwest  England , this morning after organizers
called a halt to the rain-interrupted proceedings at 9:41 p.m.
last night. By then Langer and Wiebe had halved two playoff
holes in near-darkness.  When they resumed today, they halved the 18th hole twice
more, before Langer of  Germany  could only bogey while Wiebe two-putted for a par to win.  “I think it’s always better for both players had there
been a birdie to win the playoff instead of a bogey, but right
now, I don’t really care,” Wiebe, 55, a two-time winner on the
U.S. PGA Tour, was quoted as saying on the  European Tour
website . “I’m glad it’s over, and I’m honored. I just was
luckier today and last night than Bernie, I guess.”  It was the longest playoff in the history of the
championship, and Wiebe is the eighth American winner.  Yesterday, Langer, 55, led by three shots going into the
final round, and was still two clear at the last hole after play
was held up for lightning. The 2004 Ryder Cup captain missed his
chance of victory as he double-bogeyed the 18th to drop into the
playoff with a score of 9-under. He had a final-round score of
par 70, with Wiebe on 66.  Langer won the Senior British Open in 2010 at Carnoustie in
northeast  Scotland  and won the Masters Tournament in 1985 and
1993. He ranks second on the European Tour with 40 career
titles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
