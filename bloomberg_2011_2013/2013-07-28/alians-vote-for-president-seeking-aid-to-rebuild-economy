  Mali ’s former Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and former Finance Minister Soumaila Cisse are
seen as front-runners in yesterday’s presidential elections, the
first in the West African nation since 2007.  Keita, 68, and Cisse, a former commission chairman of the
West African Monetary Union, are among 27 candidates standing
for office. International donors deemed the election necessary
before they can resume aid to the country. Most of the polling
stations closed at 6 p.m. local time, Youssouf Toure, a
spokesman for the electoral commission, said by phone.  Voting “has gone well so far,” Louis Michel, head of the
European Union observer mission, told reporters in Bamako after
polls closed. “I think the vote has been transparent but I
would like to meet with the other observers from the EU and with
the other observation missions to have a more specific idea.”  Mali,  Africa ’s third-biggest gold producer, has been
gripped by conflict for more than a year after an ethnic-Touareg
uprising in the north prompted a group of soldiers to overthrow
the government. French and pan-African forces subsequently
intervened to restore order after the Touaregs joined Islamist
militants in an offensive that almost split the nation in half.  Mali’s electoral commission said this month it would be
“extremely difficult” for all 6.9 million eligible voters to
cast a ballot. At least half a million residents have fled from
the north to the south or to neighboring countries, according to
the  United Nations . Interim ruler Dioncounda Traore isn’t
eligible to stand for election under an accord brokered by
international mediators last year.  Economy ‘Pathetic’  “These elections are important as many foreign donors want
to help Mali and they want a stable government,” Lala Toure,
63, a retired teacher, said at a polling station in Bamako
yesterday. “The economic situation is pathetic. Since the
crisis started, we are at a stalemate. The business is slow and
we hope everything will go back to normal after the election.”  International donors say a vote must be held before they
can start providing as much as $4 billion in aid pledged in May.  The election “appears to be seen as a box to be ticked
before the political class and international partners can get
down to do serious business,” said Brussels-based  International
Crisis Group , which recommended delaying the election by three
months.  A run-off may be held Aug. 11 because the first round
likely won’t produce an outright victor, according to a survey
this month by the Center for Statistical Studies and Applied
Informatics in Bamako, the capital. Of the 5,385 people
questioned, 41 percent said they support Boubacar Keita and 20
percent Cisse.  Gold Mining  Mali’s $10.6 billion economy contracted 1.2 percent in
2012, according to the  International Monetary Fund . It may
expand 4.8 percent this year because gold mining hasn’t been
affected by the fighting, according to the fund.  AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  and  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  are among the miners in
Mali.  Some of the 21,124 polling stations nationwide didn’t get
all the equipment needed and experienced difficulty operating
early yesterday. As many as 85 percent of the voting cards were
distributed as of July 26, according to Gamer Dicko, head of
communications at the Ministry of Territorial Administration.  Attack Threat  The Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, a group
that’s linked to al-Qaeda and is known by its French
abbreviation, Mujao, threatened to attack polling stations,
government departments, army barracks and the police,  Agence
France-Presse  reported, citing a statement released by the
Nouakchott Information Agency of neighboring Mauritania on July
27.  Malian and French troops and UN peacekeepers guarded
stations to ensure safety, Modibo Traore, a spokesman for the
Malian army, said. Members of the National Movement for the
Liberation of Azawad, a Touareg rebel group, protested agaisnt
the elections in the northern town of Kidal, he said.  “Everything is going fine in terms of security,”  Traore
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
