Yandex NV (YNDX) , Russia’s largest search
engine, said co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Ilya Segalovich died yesterday at 48.  Doctors switched off Segalovich’s life support after
detecting changes in blood that were incompatible with life,
Yandex Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Arkady Volozh said
in the company’s blog today.  Segalovich had been diagnosed with a treatable form of
cancer and was responding well to treatment and working a full
schedule before unexpectedly succumbing to complications, Yandex
said on July 25. The company initially reported the death of its
CTO that day, later clarifying that he was on life support,
without any signs of brain activity.  Segalovich and Volozh co-founded their business more than
20 years ago and it is now valued at about $11 billion. They
created software enabling a context search through the Bible on
compact discs and in 1997 set up the Yandex.ru Internet search
engine, which now controls more than 60 percent of the Russian
market, beating Google locally.  “Ilya Segalovich is a success story that is worth
emulating, especially for young people,” Russian Prime Minister
 Dmitry Medvedev  said on his Facebook page on July 25. “He was a
high-level professional with a kind heart and the ability to
inspire and care about people around him.”  Segalovich will be buried next week, with full details to
be announced later, Volozh said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
