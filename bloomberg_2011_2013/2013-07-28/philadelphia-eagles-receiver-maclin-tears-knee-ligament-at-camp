Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver
 Jeremy Maclin  tore a ligament in his right knee during a non-contact drill at the National Football League team’s training
camp.  The team said on its website that Maclin, 25, was carted
off the field after the injury yesterday.  The Eagles’ first-round draft pick in 2009, Maclin has a
team-high 258 receptions and has 26 touchdown catches over the
last four seasons. Maclin is entering the final year of his
rookie contract.  “He just came off the line of scrimmage and his knee
buckled a little bit,” fellow wide receiver  DeSean Jackson  told
reporters. “Any time a player goes down on a stretcher, you
definitely have to be concerned.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
