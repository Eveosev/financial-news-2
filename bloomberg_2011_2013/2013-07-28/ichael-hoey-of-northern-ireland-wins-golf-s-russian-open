Northern Ireland’s Michael Hoey
scored a final-round 70, 2-under par, to win golf’s Russian Open
by four shots.  Hoey finished on 16-under in Moscow, ahead of France’s
Alexandre Kaleka and Matthew Nixon of  England , who were joint
second.  “I have absolutely loved the golf course this week,”
Hoey told the European Tour  website . “The putting was the key
for me. I have been working hard on that a lot recently and the
improvement is really showing because I’m making a lot of
birdies.”  Hoey, 34, picked up a check for 166,660 euros ($221,000)
with his fifth win on the tour.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
