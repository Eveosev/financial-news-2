Hundreds of protesters in Hong Kong
marched to the city’s government headquarters, demanding
Secretary for Development  Paul Chan  resign for alleged conflict
of interest related to a housing project,  Radio Television Hong
Kong  reported.  Chan is being questioned about his family’s ownership of
land in Hong Kong’s northeast area where the government plans to
develop new properties, RTHK  reported  on its website, without
citing anyone. A call to his office outside business hours went
unanswered.  Hong Kong plans to sell land and build public housing for
60,700 new homes in that zone to help curb property prices in
the world’s most-expensive housing market. The government plans
to have the units in the Fan Ling North and Kwu Tung North areas
completed by the 2022 to 2023 fiscal year, Chan said on July 4.  Home prices  have more than doubled since early 2009 on an
influx of mainland Chinese buyers, near record-low  interest
rates  and a lack of new supply. Hong Kong’s Chief Executive
Leung Chun-ying took over in July last year after having pledged
to increase supply to help make housing more affordable for the
general public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
