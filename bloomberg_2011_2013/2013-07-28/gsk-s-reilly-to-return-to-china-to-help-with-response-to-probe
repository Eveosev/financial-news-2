GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  said former
China head Mark Reilly will assist police in a bribery probe
after returning to the country, where government radio reported
authorities detained another 18 of the drugmaker’s employees.  Reilly, replaced as China head by Herve Gisserot, “will be
returning to China shortly,” Glaxo’s Melbourne-based
spokeswoman Lisa Maguire said in an e-mail today, without giving
a more specific timeframe.  Glaxo’s former China chief left the country last month
after four of his colleagues were detained as part of a
government probe that has produced allegations of 3 billion  yuan 
($489 million) in spurious travel and meeting expenses as well
as trade in sexual favors. Government scrutiny has extended to
other foreign drugmakers and local hospitals since  China ’s
Ministry of Public Security detailed the Glaxo allegations on
July 15.  Police in the central city of Zhengzhou are holding 18
Glaxo employees and some medical personnel, China National Radio
reported on July 26. The report didn’t give details about when
or why the workers were detained.  “We are unable to comment on specific employees,” Garry
Daniels, a Singapore-based spokesman for Glaxo, said in response
to e-mails requesting comment on the Zhengzhou detainees. A
staff member who answered the main line for Zhengzhou police
headquarters, and who asked not to be named, said details of
cases could not be provided over the phone.  Personal Relations  Some Glaxo salespeople in China had established “good
personal relations with doctors by catering to their pleasures
or offering them money, in order to make them prescribe more
drugs,” the official Xinhua news agency said July 25, citing
interviews with police handling the case.  Glaxo’s sales contribution from China, where revenue gained
20 percent last year, is “likely to be impacted by the current
inquiries” in the second half of 2013, Chief Financial Officer
Simon Dingemans said on a July 24 earnings call. “It’s too
early to quantify this,” he said.  China accounted for about 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion)
in Glaxo sales last year, according to the company.  Glaxo has commissioned law firm Ropes & Gray to conduct an
independent review on the China investigation, Glaxo Chief
Executive Officer  Andrew Witty  said on the July 24 call.  “Mark Reilly remains an active member of our senior
executive team that is managing this issue,” Daniels of Glaxo
said in an e-mail today. “Mark will play a key role in the
internal review and response to the ongoing investigation.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
