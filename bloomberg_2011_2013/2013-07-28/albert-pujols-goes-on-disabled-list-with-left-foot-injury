Albert Pujols  was placed on the 15-day disabled list by the  Los Angeles Angels  with a foot injury.  A scan revealed a partial tear of a ligament in the arch of
Pujols’s left foot, the Angels said in a statement on their
website today. The club called up left-handed outfielder Kole
Calhoun to take his place.  Pujols, 33, has played through a “severe case of plantar
fasciitis all season,” the Angels said. In 99 games this year,
65 of them as designated hitter, Pujols is batting .258 with 17
home runs and 64 runs batted in.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
