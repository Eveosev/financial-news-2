Brandt Snedeker won golf’s Canadian
Open by three shots to join Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Matt Kuchar with multiple U.S. PGA Tour titles this season.  Snedeker shot a final-round 2-under-par 70 yesterday at
Glen Abbey Golf Club in Oakville, Ontario, for a four-round
total of 16-under-par 272. Snedeker received $1.01 million for
his sixth career PGA Tour title and second this year after his
win at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in February.  “This is a tournament I said early on in my career I
wanted to win just because my caddie is from  Canada  and it’s his
national open,” Snedeker said at a news conference. “It’s the
third oldest tournament on tour, it’s got some great history,
and now to put my name on that trophy it means a lot.”  Snedeker, 32, moved into the outright lead at 15-under par
when Dustin Johnson hit his tee shot out of bounds at No. 17 and
took seven shots at the par-4 hole to drop to 12-under.  Johnson finished in a four-way tie for second place at 13-under with Kuchar, William McGirt and Jason Bohn.  The Bridgestone Invitational, a World Golf Championships
event, is scheduled for Aug. 1-4 at Firestone Country Club in
Akron,  Ohio . It’s the last stop on the tour before the final
major tournament of the year, the PGA Championship, which will
be played Aug. 8-11 at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
