BBC  presenter Andrew Marr, one of
the highest-profile figures in British television, will return
to fronting his regular Sunday-morning politics program in
September after suffering a stroke in January.  Marr will again present the show that bears his name on
Sept. 1, when it resumes after a summer break, the BBC said
today. Other presenters including Jeremy Vine and Sophie Raworth
have been standing in for Marr on the flagship program.  “I’m hugely looking forward to coming back and want to
give it my all but recovering from a stroke does take time,”
Marr said in an e-mailed statement today. He said he will also
return to presenting his Monday-morning Radio 4 program, “Start
the Week,” later in the year.  Last week’s “Andrew Marr Show” included a recorded
interview Marr conducted with Prime Minister David Cameron.  To contact the reporter on this story:
