The  Indiana Pacers  acquired  forward
Luis Scola from the Phoenix Suns yesterday in a trade for
forward Gerald Green, center Miles Plumlee and a future No. 1
draft pick, the Pacers said on their website.  The 6-foot-9, 245-pound Scola, a 33-year-old native of
Argentina, played five seasons with the  Houston Rockets  and last
season with the Suns. He has career averages of 14.2 points and
7.5 rebounds per game.  Indiana defeated the  New York Knicks  in the second round of
the National Basketball Association playoffs last season and
then took the Miami Heat to seven games in the Eastern
Conference finals.  “I’m very, very excited to play for the Pacers,” Scola
said in the team’s news release. “They are one of the top three
teams in the NBA, with a good shot to win a championship. I
think it’s a great team and this is a great opportunity. I can’t
wait.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
