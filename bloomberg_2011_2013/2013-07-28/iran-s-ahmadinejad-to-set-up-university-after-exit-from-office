Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  plans to establish a university after he leaves
office next week, state-run  Mehr   news agency  reported.  Ahmadinejad, who was in power for eight years, has received
permission from the  Supreme Cultural Revolution Council  to open
a university for post-graduate studies in the capital, Tehran,
council member Mohammad-Hossein Yadegari told the news agency in
a report published yesterday. Ahmadinejad said he “wanted to
have scientific activity and work in educating,” Yadegari said.  Ahmadinejad aide Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei had previously
said the president was seeking clearance to open an institution
called the “Iranian University,” according to Mehr.  Ahmadinejad fell out of favor with Supreme Leader  Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei  and his second term was fraught with quarrels
involving top officials. Still, he has indicated he will try to
retain some power, telling reporters he “will continue
serving” the Islamic Republic, according to a July 25 broadcast
on state-run  Press TV .  Local media said earlier this month that Ahmadinejad had
ordered the creation of an agency in the presidential office in
an effort to retain a presence even after successor Hassan Rohani takes over.  Rohani, elected June 14, will be endorsed in an Aug. 3
ceremony by Khamenei.  To contact the reporter on this story:
