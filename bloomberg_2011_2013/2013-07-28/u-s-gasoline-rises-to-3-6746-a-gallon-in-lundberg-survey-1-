The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps rose 8.38 cents in the past two weeks to
$3.6746 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended July 26 and is based on
information obtained at about 2,500 filling stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company.  The average, which reached a year-to-date peak of $3.795 in
the period ended Feb. 22, is about 16.88 cents above the year-earlier price of $3.5058 a gallon.  “The increase comes from gasoline retailers passing
through the wholesale price hikes that they received over the
past several days,”  Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg
Survey, said in a telephone interview. “There isn’t anything on
the supply front that would suggest another retail price hike of
this magnitude.”  The highest price for gasoline in the lower 48 U.S. states
among the markets surveyed was in Chicago, where the average was
$4.10 a gallon, Lundberg said.  The lowest price was in Charleston,  South Carolina , where
customers paid an average of $3.34 a gallon. Regular gasoline
averaged $3.92 a gallon on  Long Island ,  New York , and $4.04 in
 Los Angeles .  Futures Fell  Gasoline futures  on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell
7.31 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $3.0444 a gallon in the two weeks
to July 26.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles  fell 1.39 million barrels in the
week ended July 19 to 222.7 million, according to data from the
Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the
Energy Department.  West Texas Intermediate oil on the Nymex fell $1.25, or 1.2
percent, to $104.70 a barrel in the two weeks ended July 26.  Crude  inventories  fell a fourth consecutive time in the
week ended July 19, dropping 2.83 million barrels to 364.2
million, a six-month low. Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for WTI, fell 2.06 million barrels to 44 million,
the lowest level since November.  WTI will probably decline this week on concern that weak
economic growth will reduce demand, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Twenty-four of 38 analysts, or 63 percent, forecast crude
will decrease through Aug. 2. Nine respondents, or 24 percent,
predicted an increase. Five projected no change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
