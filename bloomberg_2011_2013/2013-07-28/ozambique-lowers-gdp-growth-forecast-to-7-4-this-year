Mozambique has cut its 2013 growth
forecast by a percentage point to 7.4 percent because of floods
that damaged crops and reduced coal shipments, Finance Minister
Manuel Chang said.  The floods killed over 100 people and hindered the
transport of coal in the first quarter of this year.  “Our initial GDP growth forecast for 2013 was 8.4 percent
but due to natural calamities that affected the country, we
revised the forecast,” Chang told reporters in the capital,
Maputo, today after a  cabinet meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
