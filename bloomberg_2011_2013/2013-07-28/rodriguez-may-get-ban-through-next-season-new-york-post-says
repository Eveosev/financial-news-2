Alex Rodriguez  this week may be
handed a ban through next season for his role in a performance-enhancing drug investigation being conducted by Major League
Baseball,  the New York Post said , without citing its sources.  MLB may issue suspensions for 15 or more players, the Post
said, following its probe of Biogenesis of America LLC, a now-shuttered Miami-area anti-aging clinic that baseball has accused
of supplying performance-enhancing substances to players.  Milwaukee Brewers outfielder  Ryan Braun , the 2011 National
League Most Valuable Player, was ordered six days ago to sit out
the final 65 games of the season without pay after becoming the
first player to be banned for connections to Biogenesis.  MLB wants Rodriguez’s sanction to be lengthier than Braun’s
because the 38-year-old  New York  Yankees third baseman said he
used steroids from 2001-03 and because it believes he lied to
investigators and hampered their examination of Biogenesis, the
Post reported.  MLB began probing Biogenesis after the Miami New Times in
January reported that it obtained medical records linking banned
substances from the clinic to players including Braun,
Rodriguez,  Nelson Cruz  of the Texas Rangers, Toronto Blue Jays
outfielder Melky Cabrera, Oakland Athletics pitcher  Bartolo Colon , San Diego Padres shortstop Everth Cabrera, Detroit Tigers
shortstop Jhonny Peralta and Yankees catcher  Francisco Cervelli .  Rodriguez and the Yankees have been at loggerheads in
recent weeks about his return following hip surgery in January.
Rodriguez has insisted he has recovered from a quadriceps strain
and is fit to play, while the Yankees have ordered him to remain
in Tampa, Florida, for treatment to his left thigh before
beginning a five-day rehabilitation assignment on Aug. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
