The family of French billionaire
 Francois Pinault , owner of Chateau Latour in Bordeaux, has
acquired California’s Araujo Estate Wines along with its
flagship Eisele Vineyard.  Araujo has 162 acres (66 hectares) in the northern Napa
Valley, including Eisele, which produces Cabernet Sauvignon red
wines, along with a winery and cellar complex. No purchase price
was disclosed.  The deal comes amid rising demand for Californian premium
wine since 2011 after three years of decline during the
financial crisis.  John Kapon , chief executive officer of New
York-based auction house Acker Merrall & Condit, described
demand for California wines this month as “very healthy.”  Araujo and Eisele “have been producing consistently one of
the very best wines of Napa Valley,” Frederic Engerer, Chief
Executive Officer of  Chateau Latour , said in a statement
released July 25.  Araujo Estate was founded by Bart and Daphne Araujo in
1990, when they acquired the 38-acre Eisele Vineyard and
additional land after Milton and Barbara Eisele had run it since
1969. Eisele is farmed on a biodynamic basis and vines have been
grown on the land since the early 1880s.  Pinault’s purchase, through the Artemis Group family
holding, brings the Napa vineyard into a stable that includes
Domaine d’Eugenie in Burgundy and Chateau Grillet in France’s
Rhone Valley.  Pinault, 76, is the founder and controlling shareholder of
French luxury goods company  Kering (KER) , whose chief executive
officer is his son Francois-Henri. The company’s brands include
Gucci, Saint Laurent and  Bottega Veneta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
