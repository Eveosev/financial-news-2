  JJB Sports Plc (JJB) ’s biggest landlord,  Hammerson Plc (HMSO) , is supporting the retailer’s proposed company
voluntary arrangement designed to keep it afloat, the Sunday

rents to stay solvent, the newspaper said. Lawrence Hutchings,
Hammerson’s managing director for retail, said the company was
