Talks between Quebec and  Canada  on
the melding of their sales taxes are advanced enough for the
parties to reach agreement, the  Canadian Press  reported, citing
Quebec Finance Minister Raymond Bachand’s spokeswoman.  The provincial minister approved a draft agreement and sent
it to his federal counterpart,  Jim Flaherty , for his
consideration last month, according to the spokeswoman,
Catherine Poulin.  The agreement would combine the provincial sales tax with
the federal goods and services tax.  The federal government is to release its budget March 22,
and opposition parties will have a chance March 25 to unseat the
government and force an election.  Because the government has fewer than half the seats in the
House of Commons, it needs members of at least one opposition
party to vote against or abstain from a confidence vote if it is
to avoid an election.  If  Quebec  and the federal government were to agree on
sales-tax harmonization, the Bloc Quebecois party “would have a
powerful incentive to support the budget,” Chantal Hebert, a
Toronto Star political columnist, wrote March 14.  “Discussions are ongoing in good faith with the government
of Quebec but some points still remain unresolved, and there’s a
fair bit more work to do,” Chisholm Pothier, a spokesman for
the federal finance ministry, said in an e-mail message to
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter for this story:
