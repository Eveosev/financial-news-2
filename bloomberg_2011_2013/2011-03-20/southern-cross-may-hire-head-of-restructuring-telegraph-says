  Southern Cross Healthcare Ltd. (SCHE)  is
close to hiring a new head of restructuring as it seeks rent
reductions from landlords, the Sunday Telegraph said, without
saying where it got the information.  The U.K. nursing care home operator may hire Tim Bolot of
Bolt Partners, the newspaper said. Local government is paying
less for patient care at the same time rents rise, the Telegraph
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
