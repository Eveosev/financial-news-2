Ireland may be prepared to sign up
to a legally binding sovereign borrowing limit, or so-called
debt brake, in return for an interest-rate cut on the European
Union portion of its aid package, the  Sunday Times  reported,
citing Lucinda Creighton, a junior government minister.  Prime Minister  Enda Kenny  will also offer what the paper
termed as constructive engagement on corporate tax
harmonization. Still, Ireland is not prepared to raise its 12.5
percent corporate tax rate, said Creighton, the junior minister
for European affairs, according to the report.  Ireland is hopeful of getting a 1 percentage point cut to
the 5.8 percent interest rate as EU leaders meet on March 24-25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
