  Sonova Holding AG (SOON)  executives
learned at a February budget meeting that the company wouldn’t
meet sales targets,  NZZ am Sonntag  reported, citing an
unidentified employee.  Sonova on March 16 reduced its sales and profit forecast,
and the company “had reacted immediately after management was
surprised by the weak sales in February,” company spokesman
Holger Schimanke told the newspaper. He said management or board
members didn’t profit from any insider information when selling
securities in March, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
