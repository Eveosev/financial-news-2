  Arab League  Secretary General Amr Moussa said the no-fly zone now being enforced over  Libya  by a
coalition force, initially backed by Arab countries, does not
require the use of force, the Middle East News Agency reported,
citing remarks by him.  Negotiations are now taking place for members of the Arab
League to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation in
Libya, the Egyptian government-owned agency cited Moussa as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
