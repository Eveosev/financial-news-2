Corn and soybeans may rise for the
second straight week on speculation that wet, cold weather will
delay planting and reduce yield prospects in the U.S., while
rain threatens oilseeds ready for harvest in  Brazil .  Nineteen of 26 traders and analysts surveyed from  Singapore 
to Chicago on March 18 said corn will advance this week, and 20
of 27 respondents said soybeans will gain. Last week on the
Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for May delivery rose 2.9
percent to $6.835 a bushel, and soybeans futures for May
delivery gained 2.1 percent to $13.625.  Last weekâ€™s advances for both commodities were expected by
the majority of respondents surveyed on March 11. Since 2004,
the surveys have been correct 55 percent of the time for corn,
and 53 percent for soybeans.  Bullish on corn: 19    Bullish on soybeans: 20
Bearish on corn:  7    Bearish on soybeans:  7  To contact the reporter on this story:
