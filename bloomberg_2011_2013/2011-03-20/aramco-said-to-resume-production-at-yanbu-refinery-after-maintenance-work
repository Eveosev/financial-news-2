  Saudi Aramco , the state-owned oil
producer, resumed production at its wholly owned Yanbu refinery
after completing a maintenance shutdown last week, two people
with knowledge of the schedule said.  The 225,000 barrel-a-day refinery restarted after the
shutdown ended on March 16, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the company doesn’t disclose its maintenance
programs publicly. The plant on  Saudi Arabia ’s Red Sea coast
produces gasoline, diesel,  fuel oil , jet fuel and liquid
petroleum gas for domestic use, according to Aramco’s  website .  Refinery operators generally schedule major maintenance
shutdowns, known as turnarounds, every three to five years,
stopping most units while repairs are done. Aramco started
servicing the Yanbu facility on Feb. 2 for about 45 days, the
people said.  An Aramco spokesman had no immediate comment on the
maintenance.  Saudi Aramco and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  run a separate joint-
venture refinery in the same city. Aramco also agreed last week
with China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec, for the
Beijing-based company to take a 37.5 percent stake in a third
refinery that Aramco plans to build in Yanbu.  Saudi Arabia is expanding refining capacity to process more
gasoline, diesel and other fuels as domestic demand rises. The
kingdom is building two additional refineries, one at Jubail on
the Persian Gulf coast and the other at Jazan in the country’s
southwest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
