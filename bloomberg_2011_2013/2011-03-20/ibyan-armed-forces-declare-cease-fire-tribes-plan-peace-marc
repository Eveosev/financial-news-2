The Libyan armed forces leadership
declared a nationwide cease-fire to take effect tonight.  “The armed forces has issued its command to all military
units in  Libya  to safeguard the immediate cease-fire everywhere
in Libya from 9 p.m.,” according to a statement read on Libyan
television.  The armed forces’ statement came immediately after a call
from a spokesman of the “Popular Social Leadership of Libya,’
described as an ‘‘umbrella’’ organization comprising all Libyan
tribes, for an immediate ceasefire and a peace march to resolve
the conflict between the warring sides.  A ‘‘historical, peaceful march’’ by all cities, towns and
tribes in Libya, would take place, going from Tripoli to
Benghazi in order to ‘‘exchange condolences,’’ with the victims
of the unrest and ‘‘pronounce forgiveness,’’ the spokesman said
in a statement read at the news conference in Tripoli.  Then all Libyans ‘‘could sit down as one family to discuss
the affairs of our homeland and the future of Libya in a
democratic and peaceful way,’’ the spokesman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
