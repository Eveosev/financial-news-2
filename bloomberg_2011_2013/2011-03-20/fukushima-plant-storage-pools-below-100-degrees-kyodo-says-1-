The temperature of Tokyo Electric
Power Co.’s storage pools in No. 1 through No. 6 reactors in
Fukushima prefecture measured less than 100 degrees centigrade,
Kyodo news reported, citing Defense Minister Toshimi Kitazawa.  “These readings are something that Japanese people can be
relieved to hear,” Kyodo reported Kitazawa as saying at a press
conference today.  The temperature of the No. 3 nuclear reactor at the plant
was at 128 degrees centigrade at the top, based on measuring
done by  Japan ’s self defense forces’ helicopter, a separate
Kyodo news report said, citing the minister. A reading of 128
degrees centigrade is within expectations for a reading at the
top, the minister said according to another report.  Measurements will be taken next on March 23 and then every
Tuesday and Friday after that, another Kyodo news report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
