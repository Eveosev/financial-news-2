Irish Credit Bureau  Chief Executive
Officer Seamus O’Tighearnaigh said that 9.5 percent of loans
registered with the company are at least one month in arrears,
up from 0.75 percent in 2006, the  Sunday Times  reported.  The bureau, owned by the country’s main lenders, tracks
payments on consumer and small business loans from banks, home-
loan providers, credit-card issuers,  credit unions  and hire-
purchase firms. Equipment leasing to small companies is one of
the areas of most concern, the paper cites O’Tighearnaigh as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
