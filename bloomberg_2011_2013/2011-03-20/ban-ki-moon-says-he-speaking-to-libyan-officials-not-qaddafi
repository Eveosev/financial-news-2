United Nations Secretary General
Ban Ki-moon has been speaking to Libya’s prime minister and
foreign minister although he had not had any fresh contact with
Colonel  Muammar Qaddafi , he said in an interview.  “I have been thinking about the possibility of speaking to
him but the way he has been speaking publicly made me feel a bit
questionable whether I could have any meaningful or constructive
dialog with him,” Ban said in Paris today. “That is why I have
been speaking to the prime minister and foreign minister on
several occasions.”  “I have been assured by both they would fully comply with
the resolution,” Ban added, “But they have not kept their
promises.”  Ban last spoke to Libya’s Prime Minister Al Baghdadi Ali
al-Mahmoudi two days ago, on the eve of military attacks, and he
sounded “rather desperate,” according to a UN statement
yesterday. Ban told reporters in Paris that he thought the
telephone call was “troubling”.  The UN secretary general said that if the Libyan government
stopped all military action against the people “there could be
some ways for discussion,” without elaborating.  Ban said regime change was a matter for the people, and it
was unfortunate Qaddafi hadn’t recognized the UN Security
Council Resolution 1973 which authorized action against  Libya 
forces.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
