  Punch Taverns Plc (PUB)  may be split into
two with the Spirit division spun off to manage pubs, the Sunday
Times said, without saying where it got the information.  The plan is being considered by Punch’s Chief Executive
Officer Ian Dyson, the newspaper said. The rest of the business
would include Punch’s tenanted pubs, run by individual
landlords, the newspaper said. They could be sold or closed
under the plan, the Times said.  A spokeswoman contacted today said the company had no
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
