  Germany ’s nuclear-reactor owners
aim to take another five plants offline by May to complete a
safety review within the terms of a moratorium ordered by the
government last week,  Die Welt  reported.  With seven of the country’s 17 reactors ordered offline
last week, shutting down another five would mean that installed
capacity of all the plants in the country would be reduced by 75
percent, or 15,000 megawatts, the newspaper cited the reactor
owners as saying, in a preview of an article to be published
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
