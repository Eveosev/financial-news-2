A German police helicopter ferrying
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to state election rallies last week had
mid-air turbine failure after dropping her off at a venue,
according to the  Bild-am-Sonntag  newspaper.  The  Eurocopter  Super Puma 332 ran into trouble at 9 p.m. on
March 16, shortly after Merkel left the aircraft in the town of
Offenburg, said the newspaper in citing police reports. Both
turbines cut out causing the helicopter to plunge before the
three-man crew managed to restart the motors, Bild said.  The  Braunschweig-based Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident
Investigation  is examining the incident, according to Bild. The
aircraft was delivered new to the German policeâ€™s VIP air
service in December last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
