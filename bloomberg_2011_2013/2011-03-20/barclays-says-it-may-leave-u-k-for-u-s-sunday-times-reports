  Barclays Plc (BARC)  told the U.K. Treasury
that it may move its headquarters to the U.S. if the government
proceeds with plans to break up banks, the  Sunday Times  said.    John Varley , the bankâ€™s former chief executive officer,
told U.K. officials last week that forcing banks to split retail
units from investment banking would harm the economy by raising
the cost of finance for borrowers, the newspaper said.  Giles Croot, a spokesman for Barclays, declined to comment
when contacted by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
