Skye Bank Nigeria Plc, a Nigerian
lender, plans to raise $1.5 billion from international funding
agencies for onward lending to its customers to support their
businesses this year, the bank said in an emailed statement
today.  That’s a 200 percent rise in the amount it raised for
customers in 2010. The increase this year is “as a result of
rising demand from its customers,” says Moji Hunponu-Wusu, the
lender’s Head of International Funding Group.  “Among businesses financed under the International Funding
Group are infrastructure, hotels, vessels and other service
industry that get dollar income,” she said. She did not mention
which international agencies the money is coming from.  To contact the reporter on this story:
