discussions with bankers about funding to complete the 64-story
Pinnacle tower in the Bishopsgate section of London, the Sunday

its supporters in exchange for a finance package from a group of
lenders including  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
