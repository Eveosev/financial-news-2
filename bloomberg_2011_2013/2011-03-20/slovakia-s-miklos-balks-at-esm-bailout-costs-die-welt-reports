Financing for the future European
Stability Mechanism unfairly places a heavier burden on the
currency region’s poorer members than it does on other partner
countries, Slovak Finance Minister Ivan Miklos said,  Die Welt 
reported.  Slovakia pays more than twice Luxembourg’s contribution to
a temporary fund that will be succeeded by the ESM in 2013,
Miklos is cited as saying in a preview of an interview to be
published tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
