  Clariant AG (CLN)  didn’t commission a so-
called fairness opinion from an outsider ahead of its agreed
purchase of  Sued-Chemie AG (SUC) ,  NZZ am Sonntag reported , citing
company spokesman Ulrich Steiner.  The company had enough information about the purchase
target from discussions with its bankers and advisers, the
newspaper said, citing Steiner. The missing fairness opinion by
an outsider is prompting Dominique Biedermann, the director of
shareholder activist group Ethos, to oppose a planned capital
increase to finance the purchase, the newspaper said.  Clariant considers the purchase price to be
“appropriate,” the newspaper cited Steiner as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
