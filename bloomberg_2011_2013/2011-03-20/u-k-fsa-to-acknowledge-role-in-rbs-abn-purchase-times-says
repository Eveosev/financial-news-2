Britain’s Financial Services
Authority will acknowledge its role in the slide of  Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  after it acquired ABN Amro Bank NV, the
Sunday Times said, without saying where it got the information.  A report may focus on the banking regulator’s decision not
to hinder the RBS purchase of the Dutch bank, the Times said.
RBS is now owned by the government after taxpayer-assisted
funding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
