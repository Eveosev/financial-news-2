Britain’s plans for nuclear  power
plants  “have to go ahead,” Electricite de France SA’s U.K.
Chief Executive Officer Vincent de Rivaz said.  There must be “no knee-jerk response” to nuclear power in
the wake of safety issues raised by the situation in Japan, De
Rivaz told the  BBC ’s “Marr” program in an interview today.  He said the safety authority has said there are “good,
robust safety standards in our plants” in the U.K.  “What is happening in Japan will teach us and all the
lessons will be put into practice here in Britain,” he added.
“We are conscious that these events will have an impact on our
plans for the future. Our plans have to go ahead, but I will not
prejudge what will be the consequences of these events in  Japan 
on our plants.”  He said the plans for Britain remain “undimmed, because
the U.K. needs nuclear. The question for me is how we are going
to take the lessons on board in our plans.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
