Two people were killed in a bomb
blast outside the ECWA Church, Nasarawa Gwom in Jos, a city in  Nigeria ’s Plateau state, a region beset in recent months by
sectarian violence, a government official said.  “We suspect the two men were trying to plant a bomb
outside the church while Sunday service was on when the bomb
exploded, killing both of them,” Gregory Yenlong, the Plateau
State commissioner for information in a telephone interview. “A
major tragedy was aborted today, because there was a very large
congregation.”  More than 200 people have died in reprisal attacks by
Christian and Muslim groups in the Plateau region, according to
New York-based  Human Rights Watch , since multiple bomb blasts in
Jos city on Christmas Eve killed 80 people. A radical Islamic
sect known as Boko Haram, or “Western education is a sin,”
claimed responsibility for the explosions.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous nation
with about 140 million people, is roughly split between a mainly
Muslim north and a predominantly Christian south. More than
14,000 people died in ethnic and religious clashes in the West
African nation between 1999 and 2009, according to the Brussels-
based  International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
