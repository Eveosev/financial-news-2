  Saudi Arabia ’s imports of gasoline
in January declined by 67 percent from a month earlier, reaching
its lowest since December 2009, as the Kingdom increased its
refinery output, official primary data showed today.  Saudi Arabia, the holder of the world’s largest proven oil
reserves, imported 19,000 barrels per day of gasoline for both
motor and aviation uses in January from 57,000 bpd in December,
according to Saudi official data posted on the Joint Data
Initiative  website , known as JODI.  Saudi Arabia increased gasoline output from its refineries
by 103,000 bpd from a month earlier to reach 424,000 bpd in
January.  JODI is supervised by the Riaydh-based  International Energy
Forum  and its data goes back to 2002. The initiative only runs
primary official data from submitting parties.  Saudi Arabia increased crude oil output in January by
149,000 bpd from December to 8.51 million bpd, the highest
monthly production figure since December 2008, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
