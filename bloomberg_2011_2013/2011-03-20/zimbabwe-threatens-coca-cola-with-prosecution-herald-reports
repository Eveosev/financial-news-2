  Zimbabwe  will prosecute or close
local operations of the  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  and other foreign and
white-owned businesses because they have not submitted plans to
cede a majority of their shares to black citizens, the state-
controlled  Herald  said.  The companies may face immediate closure and the revocation
of their business licenses, the Harare-based Herald said on its
website, citing Prince Mupazviriho, secretary for the
indigenization ministry. About 795 foreign and white-owned
businesses, including Zimbabwe Stock Exchange-listed  Innscor
Africa Ltd. (INAF) , have not submitted plans specifying how they will
divest 51 percent of their shares to black Zimbabweans, the
newspaper said.  Zimbabweâ€™s Indigenization and Empowerment Act, passed last
year, compels white Zimbabweans and foreign-owned companies
worth more than $500,000 to cede 51 percent stakes to black
citizens of the southern African country. Business owners may be
jailed for not complying, according to the Herald.  To contact the reporter on this story:
