Prime Minister  Julia Gillard 
signaled she may offer tax cuts to people on low incomes to
offset the introduction of charges on  carbon emissions .  “Tax cuts are a live option,” Gillard told Sky television
in an interview today. “We will be looking at doing that in the
best possible way for the economy, for communities and for
individuals.”  Australia should price carbon emissions at between A$20
($19.90) and A$30 a ton, rising at 4 percent a year, when it
introduces laws aimed at curbing emissions, government climate
change adviser Ross Garnaut said March 17. Gillard is under
pressure on the issue from the opposition Liberal-National
coalition, led by  Tony Abbott , who has vowed to block the plan
because it will raise household electricity bills.  The government would need to offer low-income households
about A$600 a year in tax cuts or extra welfare payments to
offset the cost of a carbon tax, the Sunday Telegraph said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
