  Manchester United  has renewed its
interest in Brazilian midfielder Douglas Costa, who plays for
Ukrainian club  Shakhtar Donetsk , the Sunday Telegraph reported.  United, which leads English soccerâ€™s Premier League, tried
to sign Costa from Gremio in August 2009 but was unwilling to
meet the 20 million-pound ($32.5 million) asking price, the
newspaper said.  Shakhtar, which signed the 20-year-old in January 2010, is
likely to resist selling Costa, the Telegraph added. Barcelona,
Real  Madrid  and  Manchester City  are also interested in the
player, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  James Cone  at
