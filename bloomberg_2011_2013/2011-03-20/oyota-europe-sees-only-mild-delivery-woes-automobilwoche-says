Toyota Motor Corp.’s European
division sees only slight delivery bottlenecks on the continent
following the catastrophic events in  Japan , the unit’s German
President Toshiaki Yasuda told magazine  Automobilwoche .  In an interview, Yasuda said production sites in  Europe 
account for more than 90 percent of parts used in Toyota cars
sold on the continent. Production of the remaining 10 percent of
parts made in Japan will resume on March 21, he is cited as
saying.
