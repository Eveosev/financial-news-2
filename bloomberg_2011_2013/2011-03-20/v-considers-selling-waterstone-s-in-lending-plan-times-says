HMV Plc is considering selling its
Waterstone’s bookstore chain as part of a plan to seek a
relaxation of its lending covenants, the Sunday  Times  said,
without saying where it got the information.  HMV’s bankers have told the CD and DVD retailer that it
needs to raise as much as 75 million pounds ($122 million) in
return for loosening the agreements, the newspaper said. HMV may
also consider a share sale or store closings, the newspaper
said.  A spokesman for HMV declined to comment when contacted by
telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
