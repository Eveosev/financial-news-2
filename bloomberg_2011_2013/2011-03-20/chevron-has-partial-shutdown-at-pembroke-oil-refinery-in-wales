  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  had a partial
shutdown for a planned maintenance at the Pembroke oil refinery
in Wales that it sold to  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , potentially
limiting supplies of fuels at a time of rising prices.  The shutdown "is currently ongoing," Paul Bray, a London-
based Chevron spokesman, said today in an e-mailed statement.
"This partial shutdown will not impact Chevron’s ability to
fulfill its supply contracts."  Refiners are required to halt processing units periodically
to carry out repairs and inspections to ensure safe and
efficient operations. The Pembroke refinery can process 210,000
barrels of oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gasoline prices in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp,  Europe ’s
oil-trading hub, rose 15 percent this year amid increasing oil
costs and maintenance halts. The fuel climbed to $947 a metric
ton on March 18 from $906 on March 16, Bloomberg data shows.  Chevron agreed to sell the Pembroke plant and 1,000 retail
outlets to Valero, the largest U.S. oil refiner, for about $1.73
billion in cash, the companies said on March 11. Chevron is
based in  San Ramon , California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
