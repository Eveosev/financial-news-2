The cost of protecting Australian
corporate debt from default dropped as a new version of the
nation’s benchmark bond risk gauge was introduced.  Series 15 of the Markit iTraxx  Australia  index traded at
108.5 basis points as of 9:22 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. That’s 1.5 basis
points less than the 110 basis point close of the Series 14
index on March 18, prices from data provider CMA show.  New series of credit-default swap benchmarks are created
every six months and companies are added or dropped depending on
their ratings, cost of protection and ease of trading. The
indexes typically rise as investor confidence deteriorates and
fall as it improves.  Credit-default swaps protecting against non-payment on the
senior debt of Australia’s four biggest banks were added to the
25-member index while swaps on the lenders’ subordinated debt
were removed, according to  information  on Markit Group Ltd.’s
website. Contracts on Jemena Ltd., an Australian utility owned
by Singapore Power Ltd., replaced those on Coca-Coca Amatil
Ltd., Australia’s biggest soft-drink maker.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
