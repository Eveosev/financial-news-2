The following is a list of
companies whose shares may have unusual price changes in  Germany . Stock symbols are in parentheses and share prices are
from the previous close.  The benchmark DAX Index rose 7.52 points, or 0.1 percent,
to 6,664.40 on March 18.    Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  : AT&T Inc. agreed to buy T-
Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom in a cash-and-stock offer
valued at about $39 billion, a combination that would create the
largest mobile-phone company in the U.S.  The deal may give Deutsche Telekom an 8 percent stake in
the Dallas-based carrier, which will add a Deutsche Telekom
executive to its board of directors. The shares of Bonn-based
Deutsche Telekom dropped 1.3 percent to 9.59 euros.    Daimler AG (DAI)  : Daimler and Rolls-Royce Group Plc may
submit their joint takeover offer to German financial regulator
Bafin, pressing ahead with the 3.2 billion-euro offer even as
the share price hovers above the bid. Separately, Stuttgart-
based Daimler said it hopes to increase its van sales outside  Europe . The company’s shares rose 2.3 percent to 45.90 euros.    E.ON AG (EOAN)  : A report in today’s Die Welt newspaper
said that Germany’s four nuclear plant owners will take five
more reactors temporarily offline by May to add to the seven
already offline under a government safety review. The combined
move would remove 75 percent or 15,000 megawatts of nuclear
power generation from Germany’s grid, the newspaper said. The
shares of E.ON dropped 1.5 percent to 20.94 euros.    RWE AG (RWE)  : Germany’s four nuclear reactor owners may
have to shut down some of the plants under a safety review
ordered by the government last week. RWE’s shares fell 0.6
percent to 43.50 euros.    SAP AG (SAP)  :  SAP AG, the world’s largest maker of
business-management software, said on March 18 that it has
proposed a 20 percent increase in its annual dividend to 60 euro
cents a share. The company may report its annual statement as
early as today. The shares of SAP rose 1.6 percent to 40.72
