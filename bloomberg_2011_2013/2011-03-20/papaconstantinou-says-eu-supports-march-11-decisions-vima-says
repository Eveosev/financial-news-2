Greek Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou  expects European Union leaders will support
decisions made earlier this month to stem the region’s debt
crisis when they meet again at the end of the week,  To Vima 
reported, citing an interview.  “The will of the EU leadership has been expressed in the
clearest manner in the official decisions of March 11,”
Papaconstantinou told the newspaper.  Papaconstantinou said he understood opposition to the
decisions in some countries where governments rely on coalition
governments or are facing elections, according to the newspaper.
“While we don’t believe there’s any reason for concern on the
substance of the decisions, we don’t stop monitoring
developments to underline our work and positions and we believe
that there will be no problems on March 25,” he told To Vima.  EU leaders pledged on March 12 to reinforce the region’s
rescue fund and enable it to buy bonds directly at issuance from
governments as part of a package to calm markets.  Greece , which
also got a cut on the interest rate on its bailout loans and a
longer repayment period, has said that it could take advantage
of the change in 2012. Euro-group finance ministers meet
tomorrow in Brussels to hammer out further details of the
package.  To contact the reporter on this story:
