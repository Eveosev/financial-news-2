Dohaland , the state-owned company
redeveloping part of Qatar’s capital, plans to raise as much as
9 billion riyals ($2.5 billion) by the end of 2013 to complete
the project, its chief executive officer said.  The 20 billion-riyal  Musheireb  project includes the
construction of four government buildings in one of the oldest
parts of Doha as well as shops, a hospital and a heritage
center. It will be built in six phases, with the first completed
in 2012 and the last in 2016.  “We are looking at providing our own financing” after the
first two phases are finished, CEO Issa Al Mohannadi said in an
interview. “There are many options we are considering now and
it could be a combination of a number of things,” such as bonds
or loans, he said.  Qatar, holder of the world’s third-largest natural gas
reserves, is investing in infrastructure and development as it
prepares to host the 2022 World Cup soccer tournament. The Gulf
country is also aiming to provide housing for a population
projected to climb by about 50 percent to 2.6 million by 2030.  Musheireb, which covers 350,000 square meters (3.8 million
square feet), is owned and initially financed by state-
controlled  Qatar Foundation , chaired by the Qatari Emir’s wife,
Sheikha Mozah Nasser bint Nasser Al-Missned.  “We are looking at our shareholders to fund us in the
beginning, but after that we hopefully will fly solo,” Al
Mohannadi said. “We will need the financing by the beginning of
2014 or end of 2013,” he said.  Borrowing Costs Rise  The cost of borrowing has soared for the six countries in
the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Qatar, after
political unrest spread from Tunisia and  Egypt . Yields on GCC
bonds rose 94 basis points to 5.984 on March 18 from Jan. 25,
when Egypt’s protests began, according to the HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai
GCC Conventional U.S. Dollar Bond Index.  Bond sales from the group rose to $5.5 billion so far this
year from $778 million in the same period last year. Emaar
Properties PJSC, the largest developer based in the  United Arab
Emirates , raised $500 million in Islamic bonds on Jan. 17.  Dohaland will award 6 billion riyals worth of contracts in
the next few years as construction on the project progresses,
the CEO said. So far, 30 percent of work has been completed on
the first phase and six floors have been built on the main
buildings, he said.  Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. and a joint-venture
partner HBK Contracting Co. were awarded a 1.56 billion-riyal
contract to build the first phase of the project in April 2010.  Four hotels, including one operated by the Mandarin
Oriental International Limited, will be built in the
development, creating 900 rooms. Buildings to house the Emiri
Court, Emiri guards and the National Archive are also under
construction, the CEO said. A heritage center and museums will
be erected while structures from before 1947 will be kept as a
reminder of the past.  To contact the reporter on this story:
