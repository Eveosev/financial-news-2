  BP Plc (BP/)  flared gases at its Carson
oil refinery in California because of a “breakdown,” according
to a filing with state regulators.  The unplanned flaring began at 6:37 a.m. local time
yesterday and will last until 7:15 a.m. today, according to the
filing with the  South Coast Air Quality Management District .
Flaring is a safety measure to prevent excessive pressure from
building up in processing units that are being started or shut.  In a separate filing, BP said it plans to flare gases from
March 20 to March 23 at the site.  The Carson refinery has the capacity to process 266,000
barrels of crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
