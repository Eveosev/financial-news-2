Nikica Jelavic scored an extra-time
winner as Rangers defeated Glasgow rival Celtic 2-1 to win
Scottish soccer’s League Cup final at Hampden Park.  The match was tied 1-1 in regulation time. Celtic’s Joe
Ledley leveled the scores in the 31st minute following Steven
Davis’s 24th-minute opener.  Eight minutes into extra time, Jelavic shot the winning
goal off a post, and in the closing moments Celtic’s Emilio
Izaguirre was red-carded after a foul on Vladimir Weiss.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
