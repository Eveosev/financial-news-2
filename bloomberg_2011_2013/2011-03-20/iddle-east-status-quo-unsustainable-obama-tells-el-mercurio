U.S. President  Barack Obama  said
the status quo in the Middle East and North Africa is
‘unsustainable,” El Mercurio reported, citing an interview.  Real stability in that region can only be achieved after
political and economic reform, Obama told the Santiago-based
newspaper. The president will be in  Chile  today as part of his
tour of  Brazil , Chile and  El Salvador .  To contact the reporter on this story:
