  Barclays Plc (BARC)  told the U.K. Treasury
that it may move its headquarters to the U.S. if the government
proceeds with plans to break up banks, the  Sunday Times  said.    John Varley , the bankâ€™s former chief executive, told U.K.
officials last week that forcing banks to split retail units
from  investment banking  would harm the economy by raising the
cost of finance for borrowers, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
