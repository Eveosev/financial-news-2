The European Union will pass a
decree that freezes the assets of  Libya ’s National Oil Corp. in
the “coming days,” Der Standard newspaper reported, citing
unidentified people in the European Commission.  The decree will also ban business contacts with the
company, also known as NOC, the Vienna-based newspaper said. The
decree is based on a United Nation resolution, which was passed
on March 17, according to the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
