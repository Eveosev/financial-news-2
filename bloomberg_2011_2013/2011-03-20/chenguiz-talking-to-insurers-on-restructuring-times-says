U.K. real estate investor Vincent
Tchenguiz is talking to life insurance companies in an effort to
restructure his 2 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) in property
holdings, the Sunday Times said, without saying where it got the
information.  Tchenguiz and his brother Robert were arrested this month
as part of a fraud investigation into the collapse of Kaupthing
Bank hf. Tchenguiz is seeking to channel cashflow from rents on
his properties to a bond used to fund pension liabilities, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
