  Daimler AG (DAI)  seeks expanded sales of
its van fleet that includes the Sprinter model outside Europe
and plans to invest hundreds of millions of euros this year and
in 2012 to back its plan, the  Euro-am-Sonntag  newspaper said.  By 2015, Daimler aims for half its van sales outside the
trade bloc and sees bright prospects in  South America , Russia,
China and the U.S., said Daimler van unit chief Volker
Mornhinweg in an interview.  In 2010, some 70 percent of Daimlerâ€™s 224,000 van sales
were within Europe, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
