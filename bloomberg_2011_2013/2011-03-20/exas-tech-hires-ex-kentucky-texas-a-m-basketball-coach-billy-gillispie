Texas Tech University  hired Billy Gillispie as its men’s basketball coach, two weeks after firing
Pat Knight.  Gillispie, a three-time Big 12 Conference Coach of the Year,
signed a five-year contract, the Lubbock-based school  said on
its website  today, without providing financial information.
Gillispie is the 14th head coach of the Red Raiders, who went
13-18 this year and 5-11 in the Big 12.  “I’m absolutely confident that he will lead our basketball
program back to the national spotlight,” Texas Tech Athletic
Director Kirby Hocutt said.  Gillispie, 51, hasn’t coached since being fired by the
University of  Kentucky  in March 2009 after the team missed the
National Collegiate Athletic Tournament for the first time since
1991. Gillispie, a Texas native, spent two seasons with the
Wildcats after a three-year spell at  Texas A&M  and two seasons
at the  University of Texas  at El Paso.  In seven years as a head coach, Gillispie has a 140-85
record. He went 40-27 at Kentucky, 70-26 at A&M and 30-32 at
UTEP.  “I can’t wait to get started,” Gillispie said in the
school’s statement. “Texas Tech is a great school that is
located in a great community and is part of one of the toughest
conferences in the country.”  Gillispie was fired by Kentucky after the 2008-09 season,
when the Wildcats went 8-8 in the  Southeastern Conference  and
finished 22-14, tied for the second-most losses in the history
of a program that’s won seven national titles.  Knight was fired by Tech three years after taking over from
his father,  Bob Knight , who holds the record for victories at
the college sport’s top level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
