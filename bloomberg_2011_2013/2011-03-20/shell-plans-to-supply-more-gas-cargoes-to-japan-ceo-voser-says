Royal Dutch Shell Plc  will supply
Japan with more liquefied natural gas cargoes to help the nation
increase power production and recover from a devastating
earthquake, Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser said today.  The company aims to supply two additional LNG cargoes that
will arrive in mid-April and is speaking with customers and the
government to determine if other supplies can be diverted to
Japan, Voser said on the sidelines of a conference in Beijing.  Energy prices may “tighten” over the next six months,
Voser said. Japan is seeking more energy to replace damaged
nuclear  power plants  that have stopped producing electricity.  Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, supplied two LNG
cargoes to Japan from  Brunei  last week to meet fuel demand. The
company was expecting to ship further cargoes, it said March 18.  Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility battling to avert a
nuclear meltdown at its Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant after the March
11 earthquake, Japan’s strongest, started scheduled power
outages to conserve electricity. The blackouts are aimed to
counter a 25 percent shortfall in power supply.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
