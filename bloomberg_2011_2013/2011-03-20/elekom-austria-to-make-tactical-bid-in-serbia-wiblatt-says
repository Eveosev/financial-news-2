  Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  will make a
“tactical” bid for Telekom Srbija AD that will not meet the
tender requirements, Wirtschaftsblat newspaper reported, citing
a person familiar with the process.  Telekom Austria’s management is doing this to prevent
bilateral talks between  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and the Serbian
government and keep a “foot in the door,” the Vienna-based
paper said.   Deutsche Telekom also will submit a bid, Wirtschaftsblatt
said, citing people familiar with the company.  Bids for Telekom Srbija are due tomorrow. Elisabeth Mattes,
a spokeswoman for Telekom Austria, told the paper that the
company still was in the process of evaluating whether to submit
a bid.  It remains uncertain whether a future owner of Telekom
Srbija will be required to pay back the company’s debts, which
may stem from arrears in social security tax, according to the
report. Buyers may also be required to make job guarantees for
Telekom Sribja’s 14,500 employees, Wirtschaftsblatt said.     To contact the editor responsible for this story:
