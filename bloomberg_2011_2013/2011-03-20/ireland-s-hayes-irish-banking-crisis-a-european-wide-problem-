Brian Hayes, Ireland’s junior
minister for public service reform, said the country’s banking
crisis is a “European-wide problem” and that the European
Union has a “responsibility to help” solve it.  “Part of the problem was created by  Europe , by cheap money
coming into this country, but a lax regulatory system across the  euro zone ,” Hayes said in an interview with Dublin-based
broadcaster RTE Radio today. “They have a responsibility to
help us solve this problem. I think we’re getting that message
through right now.”  The government is unlikely to have an outcome on its aim to
share the burden of banking losses with bondholders before the
results of central bank stress tests of lenders are published on
March 31, he said. Ireland “can’t take some kind of unilateral
action,” he said. Among options the government is hoping for is
a “medium-term financing” facility, in order to wean banks off
short-term European Central Bank funding, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
