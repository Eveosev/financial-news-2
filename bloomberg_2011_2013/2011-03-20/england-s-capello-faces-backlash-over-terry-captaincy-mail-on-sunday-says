England soccer manager  Fabio Capello  faces a “credibility crisis” among his players after
he reinstated Chelsea’s  John Terry  as captain of the national
squad, the  Mail on Sunday  reported.  Terry was stripped of the role 13 months ago after reports
about his private life. Manchester United’s Rio Ferdinand, his
successor who’s now injured, is said to be “bewildered” by the
decision to restore Terry and upset that he wasn’t informed
before it was made public, the Mail added. Some players are
“aghast” at the move and how it’s been handled, the newspaper
said.  Capello confirmed the decision last night and will tell the
squad tomorrow that Terry will remain captain until the
manager’s tenure ends in 2012, the Mail reported.  England plays  Wales  in a Euro 2012 qualifier in Cardiff
next weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
