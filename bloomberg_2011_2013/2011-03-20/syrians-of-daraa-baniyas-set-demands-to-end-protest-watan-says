Residents of two Syrian cities
where protests broke out March 18 handed a list of demands to
authorities to halt an escalation, Damascus-based Al Watan
newspaper reported.  In the southern Syrian city of Daraa near  Jordan ,
protesters demanded the release of detainees recently jailed on
political charges, the dismissal of some officials and
permission to sell land on border territories without prior
government approval. They also want those responsible for the
killing of two during the March 18 clashes put on trial.  In Baniyas, a coastal Syrian city, people also demanded the
freedom for detainees, an Islamic-teaching school instead of
mixed schools, permission for veiled women to return to teaching
and the ouster of some policemen out of the city.  To contact the reporters on this story:
