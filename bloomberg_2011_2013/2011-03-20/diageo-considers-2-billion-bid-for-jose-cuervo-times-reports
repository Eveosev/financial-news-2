  Diageo Plc (DGE)  is considering a $2
billion offer for Jose Cuervo SA, the tequila label in which it
owns the international distribution rights, the Sunday Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The Beckmann family, which owns the label, has hired  Barclays Plc (BARC)  to help arrange a possible sale of all or part of
the group, the newspaper said.  Bacardi Corp.,  Pernod-Ricard SA (RI)  and  Brown-Forman Corp. (BF/A)  may
also make bids, according to the report.  Ian Wright, a London-based spokesman for Diageo, declined
to comment when contacted by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
