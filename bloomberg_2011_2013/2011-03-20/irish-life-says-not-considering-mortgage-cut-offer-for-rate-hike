  Irish Life  & Permanent Plc is not
considering offering “lump sum mortgage debt forgiveness” in
exchange for customers making higher monthly payments on loans
that track the European Central Bank benchmark rate, a spokesman
for the company said.  “We are looking at a lot of options for our tracker book,
but the idea of lump sum mortgage debt forgiveness in exchange
for customers making higher interest payments is not under
consideration,” said Ray Gordon, a spokesman for Irish Life, by
telephone today.  The Sunday Business Post reported today that Irish Life’s
banking unit Permanent TSB was considering offering customers on
ECB tracker rates the chance to write off 10,000 euros of a
mortgage for every 1 percentage point increase in the rate being
paid, the newspaper said. Half of the bank’s 38 billion euros of
loans are ECB tracker mortgages, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
