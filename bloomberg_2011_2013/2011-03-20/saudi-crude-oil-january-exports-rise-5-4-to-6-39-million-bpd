  Saudi Arabia ’s crude oil exports
increased by 5.4 percent in January as exports from other OPEC
countries such as  Algeria , Nigeria,  Ecuador , and  Kuwait  fell,
official primary data from exporting countries showed today.  Saudi Arabia’s crude oil exports reached 6.39 million
barrels per day in January from 6.05 million barrels in
December, according to Saudi official data posted on the Joint
Data Initiative  website , known as JODI.  Exports from Algeria fell by 122,000 bpd to 684,000 bpd,
while they fell in Nigeria by 146,000 bpd to 2.41 million bpd.
Kuwait’s exports fell slightly by 11,000 bpd and exports fell by
17,000 bpd in Ecuador.  Exports from the rest of the 13 member countries of OPEC
increased during that month with exception of the UAE, which did
not submit data.  Significant increase in crude oil exports during January
came from Saudi Arabia and  Venezuela  after they added 347,000
bpd and 168,000 bpd, respectively.  JODI is supervised by the Riaydh-based  International Energy
Forum  and its data goes back to 2002. The initiative only runs
primary official data from submitting parties.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest holder of proven oil
reserves, increased crude oil output in January by 460,000 bpd
above its OPEC quota.  The country’s output reached 8.51 million barrels per day
in January after it added 149,000 barrels per day from December,
the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
