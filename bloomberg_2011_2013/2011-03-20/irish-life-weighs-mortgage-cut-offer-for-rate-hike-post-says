Irish Life & Permanent Plc may
offer partial home loan write-offs in exchange for customers
making higher monthly payments on loans that track the European
Central Bank benchmark rate, the  Sunday Business Post  reported,
citing unnamed industry officials.  The offer, which has not yet been approved, would see the
company’s banking unit Permanent TSB write off 10,000 euros of a
mortgage for every 1 percentage point increase in the rate being
paid, the newspaper said.  Half of the bank’s 38 billion euros of loans are ECB
tracker mortgages, the Post said.  The bank is also looking at offering incentives for
borrowers to repay loans ahead of schedule, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
