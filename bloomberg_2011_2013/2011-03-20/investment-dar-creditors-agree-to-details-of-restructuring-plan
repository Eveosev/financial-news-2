Investment Dar Co., the owner of
half of Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd., said its management and the
coordinating committee that represents its creditors agreed to
the final details of a restructuring plan.  The details of the "long form term-sheet, which sets out
the mechanics of the proposed restructuring plan, were agreed"
in meeting on March 16, Kuwait-based Investment Dar said in an
e-mailed statement today. The plan is under review by a Kuwaiti
court, which holds its next hearing on April 7, it said.  Investment Dar said last month it agreed with creditors to
a revised plan to pay 1 billion dinars ($3.6 billion) of Islamic
bonds and loans over as long as eight years. The companyâ€™s
creditors include more than 100 banks and investors.  Investment Dar, which missed a payment on a $100 million
Islamic bond in May 2009, said in March last year it was
applying for legal protection under the Financial Stability Law
to implement a restructuring plan. The law was passed by the
government in 2009 to help financial institutions hurt by the
credit crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
