  China  turned away a Japanese cargo
plane operated by All Nippon Airways Co. at Dalian airport
because authorities said its loads had radiation levels that
exceeded limits. The plane departed from near Tokyo on March 16.  China hasn’t notified Japan about its restrictions for
radiation or the level measured from the cargo that included
electric parts, Hideya Ohishi, a spokesman for the All Nippon
Airways, said today in Tokyo. ANA cargo planes were allowed to
unload at Dalian after the aircraft was turned away.  Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked the Chinese
foreign ministry about the refusal, said a Land Ministry
official, who didn’t give his name because of ministry policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
