German utility RWE AG took its
Biblis A reactor offline yesterday to comply with a three-month
safety review ordered by the government in the wake of the
nuclear catastrophe in  Japan .  In a statement, RWE said it invested 1.4 billion euros ($2
billion) in recent years to upgrade safety standards at Biblis A
and its sister block Biblis B. The reactors are in the state of
Hessen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
