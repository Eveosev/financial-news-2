  South Africa ’s  Mineworkers
Investment Company  (MIC) denied that gaming and leisure company
 Peermont Global  is up for sale, as reported in the country’s
 Sunday Times  today.  “We’re not selling, and we will not be selling,” said
Paul Nkuna, chief executive of the MIC, said in a telephone
interview from his holiday home in Mpumalanga province today.
Nkuna is also chairman of the Peermont Global board of
directors. The MIC is the unlisted Peermont Global’s largest
shareholder with a 43 percent stake. The rest of the shares are
owned by Rand Merchant Bank Holdings, and an array of
international investors.  Unidentified bankers are touting a sale of the asset, which
was delisted from the  Johannesburg Stock Exchange  in an MIC-led
7.3 billion rand ($1 billion) private equity buy-out in 2007,
the Sunday Times reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  “Our partners in Peermont are also not selling. None have
indicated a desire to sell their shares,” said Nkuna, adding
that if any shares were to become available, they would have to
be offered to the MIC first. “No one is selling, they can just
forget about it,” said Nkuna.  Peermont operates gaming facilities, such as the Emperors
Palace and Monte-Casino in Johannesburg, and the Grand Palm
Hotel in Gaborone, Botswana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
