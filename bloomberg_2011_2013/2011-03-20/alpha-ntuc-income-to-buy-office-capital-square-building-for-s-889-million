  Munich Re , the world’s largest
reinsurer, agreed to sell a  Singapore  office property owned by
its unit for S$889 million ($698 million) to  Keppel Land Ltd. (KPLD) ’s
real-estate fund management arm and a partner.  The deal, the largest of its kind this year, values the 16-
storey Capital Square, located in the nation’s central business
district, at about S$2,300 per square foot, property investment
company Pacific Star Group said in an e-mailed statement today.
The buyers are Keppel Land’s Alpha Investment Partners Ltd.,
which manages $5 billion in assets, and NTUC Income.  Capital Square was purchased by Ergo Insurance Group, a
Munich Re unit, for S$505 million in 2002 and has been managed
by MEAG Pacific Star Asset Management, according to Singapore-
based Pacific Star Group. The 386,525 square-feet property,
which includes two rows of heritage shophouses, accommodates
local offices of Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and Bloomberg LP,
Keppel Land said in a  statement  on its website today.  Capital Square was expected to fetch as much as S$927
million, Singapore’s Business Times newspaper reported on March
18, without saying where it obtained the information.    Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  is the sole
arranger for the financing of this transaction, according to the
Keppel statement.  Bloomberg LP is the parent of Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
