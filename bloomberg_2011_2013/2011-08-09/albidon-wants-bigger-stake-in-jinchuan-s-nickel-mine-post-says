Albidon Ltd. (ALB)  wants to increase its
stake in Munali Nickel, the Zambian mine that is 51 percent
owned by Jinchuan Group Ltd., the  Post  reported, citing
unidentified officials at the Australian company.  A pressure group called Action Albidon, led by the
Australian investors, has been formed to spearhead the fight for
a bigger share of Munali, the Lusaka-based newspaper said. Jian-
Hua Sang, the chief executive officer of the mine, has resigned
as a result of the “power wrangle,” it said.  Albidon expressed concern that accidents at the mine have
cut forecast nickel production to 44,000 metric tons this year
from 56,000 tons last year, the newspaper said. Jinchuan has
invested about $37 million in Munali since it acquired a
majority stake in 2008, the Post said.  Munali Nickel Assistant Manager Tony Weber didn’t answer
his mobile phone when Bloomberg called him twice today seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
