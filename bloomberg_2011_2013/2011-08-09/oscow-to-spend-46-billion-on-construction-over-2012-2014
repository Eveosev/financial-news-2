Moscow plans to spend 1.35 trillion
rubles ($46 billion) on construction from 2012 to 2014,
according to a plan published on a  City Hall  website.  Spending may reach $16.4 billion in 2014, up a third from
this yearâ€™s level,  Vedomosti  said today, adding that Moscow
construction companies may lack the capacity to build that much.  The program includes roads, infrastructure, social
objectives and housing, according to the City Hall plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
