Peru’s sol rose from a five-week low
as copper advanced on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will
announce steps to spur the  U.S. economy .  The sol strengthened 0.3 percent to 2.7431 per  U.S. dollar 
at 12:45 p.m. New York time, from 2.7515 yesterday.  Copper, Peru’s top export, rebounded from an eight-month
low on bets Fed policy makers meeting today may signal plans to
safeguard the U.S. recovery. Copper fell yesterday on fears a
U.S recession and Europe’s debt crisis will slow global growth
and cut demand for industrial metals.  “There’s a lot of confusion among investors and it’s
premature to say this rebound will hold,” said Augusto Saldarriaga, head of analysis at Banco Internacional del Peru,
the nation’s fourth largest lender. “On one side we have a
group of big, weak economies and on the other we have the
emerging countries that are driving growth. The question is, in
which direction is the world headed?”  Peru , the world’s third-biggest copper producer, will see a
drop in export revenue as metal prices decline on slower global
growth, Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said yesterday in an
interview with Lima-based Canal N.  To contact the reporter on this story:
