U.S. gasoline demand fell 3.3 percent
from a year earlier as average prices at the pump gained 35
percent, according to  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Motorists bought 9.11 million barrels a day in the week
ended Aug. 5, the second-biggest payments network company said
in its SpendingPulse report. Consumption was down 1.8 percent
from the previous week. The average pump price was $3.70 a
gallon, unchanged from the week before.  Averaged over four weeks, gasoline use was 2.2 percent
below a year earlier, John Gamel, director of economic analysis
for SpendingPulse, said in the report. It was the 20th week in a
row that demand fell on that basis, Gamel said.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the companyâ€™s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
