Brazil â€™s labor ministry refused to
grant state-controlled  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  a permit to begin
production at the P-56 offshore platform because of problems
with scaffolding on the unit,  Valor Economico  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The labor ministry will inspect the platform next week,
Valor said. Petrobras said in June it would start production at
the 100,000 barrel-a-day platform this month and reach capacity
in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
