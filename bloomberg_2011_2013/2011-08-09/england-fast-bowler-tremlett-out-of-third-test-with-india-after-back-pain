England fast bowler  Chris Tremlett 
will miss the third cricket Test against India with a back
injury.  Tremlett sat out last week’s second in Nottingham with
tightness in his hamstring and back spasms. He was unable to
practice the past two days and will receive “ongoing
treatment” ahead of the fourth Test next week, the England and
Wales Cricket Board  said  on its website.  England had already included  Steven Finn  in the squad as an
extra bowling option for the match, which begins tomorrow at
Edgbaston in Birmingham.  England has won the first two games in the four-Test series
and can replace India as No. 1 in the  International Cricket
Council rankings  with another victory or by drawing the final
two matches. The fourth Test begins Aug. 18 at the Oval in
 London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
