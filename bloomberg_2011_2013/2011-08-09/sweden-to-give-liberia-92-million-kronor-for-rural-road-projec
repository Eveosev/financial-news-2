The Swedish International Development
Cooperation Agency will give  Liberia  a grant of 92 million
kronor ($14.2 million) for the expansion of a road in the
northeast, Deputy Public Works Minister Johnson Gwaikolo said.  The funding is part of a project that started in 2009 to
improve feeder roads in agricultural areas and allow residents
to have access to markets in neighboring communities, Gwaikolo
told reporters in Monrovia, the capital, yesterday.  The Swedish project has a plan to rehabilitate a total of
560 kilometers (348 miles) of roads in Bong, Lofa and Nimba
counties by its conclusion in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
