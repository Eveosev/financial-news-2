Freenet AG (FNTN) ,  Germany ’s biggest non-
network telecommunications company, said it expects recurring
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
adjusted for one-time items, to reach 350 million euros ($503
million) this year, an increase on its previous forecast of 325
million euros.  In the first six months of the year, Freenet generated
recurring ebitda of 173.9 million euros amid “intense
competitive pressure,” the Buedelsdorf-based company said in a
statement. Sales fell 5.6 percent to 1.55 billion euros.  The company, which buys access to wireless networks from
operators like Deutsche Telekom AG and Vodafone Group Plc, said
the number of its post-paid customers decreased by 97,000 in the
second quarter of this year.  This was a “markedly slower pace” than in the previous
quarter, Freenet said in the statement. The company said that
based on “another very good month in terms of customer
acquisition” in July, it now expects to lose less than 450,000
postpaid customers this year.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
