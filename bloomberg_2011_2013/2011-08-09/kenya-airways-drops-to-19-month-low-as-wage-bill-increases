Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-biggest airline, fell to its lowest level in
almost 19 months after agreeing with the workers union to
increase employees’ salaries by 25 percent.  The stock tumbled as much as 9.2 percent to 29.50
shillings, the biggest intraday fall since March 18. It traded
at 30 shillings, a fall of 7.7 percent as of 2:05 p.m. in the
capital, Nairobi, the lowest level since Nov. 25, 2009.  “The union members will get a 25 percent increase in their
salaries and allowances which will be backdated to 2008,” the
airline said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  Following a two-day workers strike in August 2009 the
airline signed a return to work agreement that included a 20
percent pay increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
