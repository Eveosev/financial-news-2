Gold futures advanced, extending a
rally to a record for the second straight day, as the  Federal
Reserve  pledged to keep its benchmark  interest rate  low at least
through mid-2013.  Gold retreated from the settlement after equities rallied
as investors studied today’s Fed policy statement. The metal has
jumped 45 percent in the past year following bond buybacks by
the central bank during two rounds of so-called qualitative
easing, combined with the lowest borrowing costs ever.  “The anxiety premium for gold remains,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “People are
disappointed that there was no mention of QE3, but the statement
shows that the government is not willing to go too excessive to
stimulate the economy.”  Gold futures for December delivery advanced $29.80, or 1.7
percent, to close at $1,743 an ounce at 1:49 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York . Earlier, the price reached a record $1,782.50. The
metal topped $1,780 in electronic trading after the Fed
statement and traded at $1,740.10 at 4:03 p.m.  Fed policy makers left the target interest rate in a range
of zero percent to 0.25 percent. The  Federal Open Market
Committee  discussed a range of policy tools to bolster the
economy and said it is “prepared to employ these tools as
appropriate.”  U.S. Debt  Yesterday, gold surged 3.7 percent, the most since March
2009, after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S. credit rating by one
level from the top AAA grade. The S&P announcement spurred a
rout in global equities and stoked concern that the U.S. may
lapse into another recession.  Silver futures for September delivery fell $1.497, or 3.8
percent, to close at $37.883 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum futures for October delivery climbed $32.80, or
1.9 percent, to $1,756.40 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . For the first time since 2008, gold traded at a
premium to the metal used mostly in catalytic converters in
vehicles. This year, platinum has dropped 1.2 percent, while
gold has surged 23 percent.  Palladium futures for September delivery advanced $6.05, or
0.8 percent, to $734.55 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
