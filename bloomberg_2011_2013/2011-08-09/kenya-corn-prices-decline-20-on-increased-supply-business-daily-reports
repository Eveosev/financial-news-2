Corn prices in Kenya fell 20 percent
this month on improved supply after the country received
shipments of the grain from Zambia and Malawi, Business Daily
reported.  The cost of a 2-kilogram (4.4-pound) bag of flour currently
retails for an average of 120 shillings ($1.28) in the capital,
Nairobi, compared with a peak of 150 shillings in July, the
Nairobi-based newspaper said, citing  Unga Group Ltd. (UNGL) 
Chief Executive Officer Nick Hutchinson.  The East African nation consumes 3.5 million 90-kilogram
bags of the grain, its staple food, annually.  To contact the reporter on this story:
