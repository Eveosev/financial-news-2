Oil rebounded before a meeting of
Federal Reserve policy makers as rising U.S. stock index futures
signaled that crudeâ€™s earlier drop to a 10-month low may have
been excessive.  Crude for September delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  advanced as much as 55 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $81.86
a barrel. Brent oil for September settlement jumped as much as
$1.61, or 1.6 percent, to $105.35 after slipping as much as $5,
or 4.8 percent, to $98.74 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
