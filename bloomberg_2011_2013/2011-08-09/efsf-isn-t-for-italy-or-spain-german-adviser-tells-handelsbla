It wouldn’t be “acceptable” to
allow Italy or  Spain  to get financial support from the European
Financial Stability Facility because they can help themselves by
changing policies, German government adviser Christoph Schmidt
said in a comment in today’s  Handelsblatt  newspaper.  Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government must push countries
to return to solid fiscal policies in the medium term rather
than allowing the EFSF to be increased, Schmidt said. The euro
is at risk unless over-indebted euro countries emulate the debt
brake enshrined in  Germany ’s constitution, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
