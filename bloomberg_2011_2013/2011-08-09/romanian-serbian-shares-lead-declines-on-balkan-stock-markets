Romania ’s benchmark equity index fell
for a sixth day in Bucharest as investors fled Balkan markets
and riskier assets across the globe.  The BET stock index dropped as much as 12.2 percent,
posting a loss of about 29 percent over the past six days, and
was trading at 4,340.86 at 3:41 p.m. in Bucharest. Fondul
Proprietatea, a property restitution fund, and Petrom, the
country’s biggest oil company, fell about 3 percent, paring
earlier losses of as much as 9 percent.  “The stock plunges are the result of a long streak of
declines, especially in the U.S., and the lack of liquidity and
small number of investors on the Bucharest Stock Exchange
translates into very big drops,” Florin Irimin, a Bucharest-
based broker at Romanian brokerage Intercapital Invest SA, said
in a phone interview today. “The investors remembered 2008 and
the panic from that year, and everybody’s watching the
international environment. If the  Federal Reserve  doesn’t
announce actions today, stocks will continue to drop.”  Share prices have fallen the most since 2008 around the
world amid concern about a widening debt crisis in  Europe  and a
downgrade of the U.S. sovereign debt rating on Aug. 5. The  S&P
500  fell 6.7 percent yesterday.  Debt Sale  Serbia’s BELEX15 gauge dropped 7.1 percent, the most since
October 2008, to close at 593.68 in Belgrade. Lender Agrobanka
AD led the declines with a 11.26 percent drop.  The Serbian government sold 291 million dinars ($3.9
million) in three-year bonds, less than three percent of what it
planned to sell at an auction today as investors demanded yields
higher than the state was willing to pay. The 10 percent coupon
bond average yield rose to 14.5 percent at the auction, up from
14.08 percent on March 30.  Yields demanded in the bids of investors were as high as
15.5 percent, according to an e-mail from the  Debt Management
Agency  in Belgrade.  “We are seeing psychological factors right now more than
anything else, because when the main world’s stock markets fall
by four or five percent a day, markets like ours, which are much
riskier, fall even more,” said Nenad Gujanicic, lead broker at
the  Sinteza Invest Group a.d.   Serbian debt has lost its appeal amid renewed dinar
declines, with the  currency trading  at 104.24 to the euro at
2:49 p.m. in Belgrade according to Bloomberg data, down 1.25
percent on the day. The dinar lost 1.3 percent against the euro
on Monday.  The Slovenian SBITOP index was down 5.9 percent, while the
CROBEX index in  Croatia  declined 3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
