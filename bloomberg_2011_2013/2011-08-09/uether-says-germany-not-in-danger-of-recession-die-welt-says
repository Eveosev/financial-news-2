Michael Huether, head of the IW
economic institute, said  Germany  isn’t in danger of falling into
a recession,  Die Welt  reported, citing an interview.  The economist said the German economy will grow “at least
3 percent,” and that while the growth won’t be as strong next
year as originally anticipated, it will still be stronger than
average, “presumably at 2 percent,” according to the e-mailed
preview of an article that will appear in tomorrow’s edition.  Dennis Snower, the head of the Kiel-based Institute for
World Economics, said the drivers of the economy will
“subside,” and he anticipates the German economy to grow
between 1.5 percent amd 2 percent, Die Welt said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
