The slump in copper on the  London 
Metal Exchange may not be over, according to technical analysis
by Sucden Financial.  Prices that dropped 9.3 percent in the past four sessions
to an 11-week low of $8,750 a metric ton yesterday are testing a
potential “neckline” in a so-called head-and-shoulders
pattern, Brenda Sullivan, a senior market strategist at Sucden,
said yesterday in a telephone interview from London. A drop
below that line, which connects the lows on Nov. 17 and May 12,
could “open targets beginning at $8,219,” or a 6.4 percent
drop from yesterday’s close, within a few weeks, she said.  While prices were up 19 percent from a year earlier, after
touching a record $10,190 on Feb. 15, the pattern of the past
few months may mean the long-term rally is “under pressure,”
Sullivan said.  If copper drops below the trend line created by the lows in
February 2009 and June 2010, at around $8,685, prices may
decline to $8,494 in a few days and “could extend all the way
to $7,374 in several weeks or months,” she said.  “Copper prices have come down so far that even really
long-term support lines are under threat,” Sullivan said.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A head-and-shoulders pattern
occurs when a price forms three consecutive peaks or valleys,
the middle being the largest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
