MBIA Inc. (MBI) , the company that insured
some of Wall Street’s most toxic debt, said it settled $8.7
billion in guarantees since March.  Its MBIA Insurance Corp. unit agreed to pay five firms to
tear up contracts insuring against losses on collateralized debt
obligations, including some made up of investment-grade
corporate bonds, the Armonk, New York-based company said today
in a statement.  “We also achieved substantial reductions in future
volatility by commuting a number of CDO transactions,” MBIA
President Chuck Chaplin said in the statement.  MBIA said second-quarter net income available to common
shareholders was $137 million, or 68 cents a share, down from
$1.3 billion, or $6.32, a year earlier.  The quarterly profit was driven by a gain on insured  credit
derivatives  that came from tearing up the contracts, as well as
a $283 million tax benefit, MBIA said.  Kevin Brown , a spokesman,
declined to say how much the company paid to settle the
contracts.  (The company will hold a conference call tomorrow at 8 a.m.
New York time. To listen, dial 1-877-694-4769 or go to http://
