China’s American depositary receipts
rose, ending five days of declines for the benchmark index, on
mounting speculation the  Federal Reserve  may signal plans to
bolster the economy.  The Bank of New York Mellon China ADR Index, which tracks
Chinese ADRs listed in the U.S., gained 1.1 percent to 377.69 at
9:56 a.m. in New York. It climbed as much as 1.3 percent
earlier. The gauge plummeted 7.3 percent yesterday, the most
since November 2008, amid a global equities rout after  Standard
& Poor’s  cut the U.S. debt rating for the first time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
