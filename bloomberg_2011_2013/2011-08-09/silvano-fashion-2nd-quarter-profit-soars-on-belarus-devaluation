AS Silvano Fashion Group, the second-
largest listed Baltic clothing company, said second-quarter
profit jumped as the devaluation of the Belarussian ruble in May
reduced costs.  Net profit increased to 15.6 million euros ($22.2 million)
from 3.7 million euros a year earlier, the Tallinn-based company
said in a regulatory statement late yesterday. Revenue rose 15
percent to 30.7 million euros.  The devaluation of Belarussian ruble by 53 percent against
the euro on May 24 raised the company’s gross profit margin for
the second quarter to 54 percent, compared with 40.4 percent a
year earlier. A “significant” part of the company’s costs is
linked to Belarussian ruble while most of its revenue is in
Russian rubles and euros, Silvano said.  The company expects further profitability from lower costs
also in the second half of the year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
