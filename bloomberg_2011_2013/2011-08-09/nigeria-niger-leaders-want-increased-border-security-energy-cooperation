Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan
and Niger’s President  Mahamadou Issoufou  met in Abuja today for
talks on increasing border security against terrorist groups and
energy cooperation by both neighbors, the Nigerian presidency
said in an e-mailed statement.  “Terrorism and trans-border crime pose a serious security
threat to all our countries, so we will strengthen border
patrols and other areas of cooperation,” Jonathan was quoted as
saying in the statement.  Niger will start oil exports before the end of this year,
Issoufou said, and expects its refinery under construction in
the southern city of Zinder to supply fuel to the northern parts
of  Nigeria , according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
