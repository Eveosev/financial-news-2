Rugby World Cup organizers said
ticket sales for the tournament starting next month in  New
Zealand  reached NZ$234 million ($191 million), or about 87
percent of their final revenue target.  About 1.08 million tickets have been sold for the Sept. 9-
Oct. 23 event, Rugby New Zealand 2011 Ltd. said today. As many
as 95,000 international visitors are expected to arrive in New
Zealand during the tournament, RNZ 2011 added, an increase of
10,000 on previous estimates.  “The upsurge in support from overseas fans is a strong
sign of confidence in our ability to host the biggest sporting
event New Zealand has ever held,” RNZ 2011 Chief Executive
Officer Martin Snedden said in an e-mailed statement.  Prime Minister John Key has predicted spending by overseas
visitors in September and October will give New Zealand’s
economy a 0.3 percent boost in the second half. Hosting rugby’s
four-yearly world championship can boost the local economy by as
much as 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion), according to a Deloitte
LLP study.  Analysis of ticket sales shows visitors are coming from
more than 100 countries during the six-week tournament, local
organizers added. Visitors on average will stay 23 days, travel
extensively around New Zealand and 44 percent will be first-time
visitors to the country.  The 20-nation World Cup starts in 21 days, when New
Zealand’s top-ranked  All Blacks  face Tonga in the first of 48
matches. The final is scheduled Oct. 23 at Auckland’s Eden Park.  More than NZ$1 million worth of tickets have been sold
since the All Blacks beat Australia 30-14 at Eden Park in a Tri-
Nations match three days ago, RNZ 2011 said.  “Our challenge over the remaining ten weeks is to generate
another NZ$34 million of revenues, the equivalent of about
another 230,000 ticket sales,” Snedden said. “This is clearly
achievable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
