(Corrects story published Aug. 9 to say old version of
Spark in sixth paragraph.)  General Motors Co. (GM) , China’s largest
overseas automaker, introduced its first sedan under a new
China-only brand to cater to entry-level buyers in the world’s
largest auto market.  The four-door 1.5-liter Baojun 630 sedan will go on sale
today, with prices from 62,800 yuan ($9,750) to 73,800 yuan,
according to the company. The car will be available in three
variants and sold to 120 dealers in eight cities, including
Zhengzhou, Nanning, Changsha and Harbin.  GM joins Honda Motor Co.,  Japan ’s third-largest automaker,
in creating cheaper China-only brands to boost sales among
first-time buyers as overall vehicle deliveries slow this year
after the government phased out incentives and imposed ownership
restrictions to curb traffic congestion.  The Baojun brand is targeted at “young professionals and
young families” with the focus in so-called second- and third-
tier cities, Matthew Tsien, the executive vice president of the
automaker’s  China  unit, told reporters in Chengdu, southwest
China today.  The nation overtook the U.S. as the world’s largest car
market in 2009. Sales increased by a record 32 percent last
year, and grew 3.4 percent in the first six months, according to
the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.  GM aims to sell 20,000 Baojun sedans this year, Tsien said.
An old version of the Chevrolet Spark car will be rebadged in
China under the Baojun brand, which will focus on developing
smaller vehicles, he said.  Industry sales will likely grow about 10 percent in 2011 as
deliveries of mini-commercial vehicles fall,  Kevin Wale ,
president of GM’s China business, said in an interview on July
8. This compares with his forecast last November for a gain of
10 percent to 15 percent.  GM’s China deliveries fell 1.8 percent to 173,398 vehicles
in July, as deliveries of commercial vehicles declined. Sales by
SAIC-GM-Wuling fell to 77,944 units from 90,658 a year earlier,
according to the company on August 5.  Honda will sell its Li Nian S1 compact sedan from 69,800
yuan in China, the company said in April. Based on the City
platform, the S1 targets entry-level consumers with its 1.3-
liter and 1.5-liter engines, the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
