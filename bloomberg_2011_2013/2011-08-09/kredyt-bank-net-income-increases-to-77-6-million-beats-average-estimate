Kredyt Bank SA (KRB) , the Polish bank that
Belgium’s  KBC Groep NV (KBC)  plans to sell, said net income surged
more than six times on lower bad-loan provisions.  Second-quarter profit jumped to 87.9 million zloty ($31
million) from 13.8 million zloty a year earlier, the bank said
in a regulatory statement today. That beat the 75.3 million-
zloty mean estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
First-half net income rose to 221.9 million zloty.  KBC, the recipient of 7 billion euros ($10 billion) in
Belgian government rescue funds, got European Commission
approval last month to sell Kredyt and Polish insurance
subsidiary Towarzystwo Ubezpieczen i Reasekuracji Warta SA, and
retain full ownership of banking units in the Czech Republic and
 Hungary .  Kredyt Bank’s provisions for unpaid loans decreased 68
percent to 45.7 million zloty, while net interest income grew 10
percent to 298.4 million zloty. The bank also boosted net fee
income to 81.2 million zloty from 76.3 million zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
