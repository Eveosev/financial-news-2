NMDC Ltd. (NMDC) ,  India ’s largest  iron ore 
producer, raised its production target by 10 percent for this
financial year after planning to increase output at its mines in
Karnataka’s Bellary area.  The company plans to produce 32 million metric tons in the
year ending March 31, against an earlier target of 29 million
tons, Chairman Rana Som said today in an interview. The state-
owned miner expects to increase sales by about 6 percent to 33
million tons, he said.  India’s  top court  on Aug. 5 allowed NMDC to mine iron ore
in the Bellary area, partially lifting a July 29 ban aimed at
curbing environmental degradation in the southern state. The
court allowed the company to produce as much as 12 million tons
annually from about 6 million tons now, while keeping a ban on
mining by all other companies in the region.  “We are making a conservative revision in our annual
targets,” Som said in New Delhi. “The output in Karnataka will
be raised as per the orders of the  Supreme Court .”  NMDC fell as much as 4 percent to 235.10 rupees and traded
at 237.25 rupees as of 2:25 p.m. in Mumbai. The Bombay Stock
Exchange’s benchmark Sensitive Index fell 1.3 percent.  The Hyderabad-based company plans to almost double daily
production in the state to as much as 35,000 tons a day from two
mines in the Bellary area, Finance Director S. Thiagarajan said
yesterday.  JSW Steel Ltd. (JSTL) , which operates the biggest factory in the
region, lowered production by 35 percent at its recently
expanded Vijayanagar plant. The Mumbai-based steelmaker expects
to operate its plants at Vijayanagar and Salem at 80 percent
capacity after the court allowed mining to restart, according to
an e-mailed statement yesterday.  NMDC’s 12 million ton output will meet 60 percent of the
requirement of the mills in the state, JSW said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
