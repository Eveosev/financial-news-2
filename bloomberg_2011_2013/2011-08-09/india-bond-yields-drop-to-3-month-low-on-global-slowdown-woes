India ’s 10-year bonds rose, pushing
yields to the lowest level in three months, on speculation a
drop in commodity prices stemming from concern over a global
economic recovery will help reduce inflation.  The wholesale  price index  has held above 9 percent for
seven months, prompting the central bank to boost borrowing
costs five times this year. Oil fell to the lowest level in more
than 10 months after Standard & Poor’s cut its top credit rating
for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA. India imports almost 80 percent of
its crude.  “It’s a blessing in disguise for bond investors as a
global slowdown will help cap inflation,” said R.S. Chauhan,
the Mumbai-based chief dealer in charge of fixed income and
currencies at  State Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur. “The central bank
may pause raising rates now.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent bonds due April 2021 declined
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.23 percent at
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. It had earlier dropped to 8.15 percent, the
lowest since May 6.  The repurchase rate was last raised on July 26 by 50 basis
points to 8 percent.  Crude for September delivery fell as much as $5.60, or 6.9
percent, to $75.71 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest price since Sept. 29.
Prices have fallen 2.3 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
