U.S. stocks slid, extending the
market’s worst plunge since 2008, and Treasuries rallied after
the  Federal Reserve  said it discussed a range of policy tools to
bolster the economy, spurring concern the central bank is not
doing enough to safeguard the economy. Treasuries reversed
losses and oil tumbled.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.3 percent to
1,115.97 at 2:40 p.m. in  New York . The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  lost 96.27 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,713.58. The 10-
year Treasury yield fell four basis points to 2.28 percent after
rising earlier. Oil sank 3.5 percent to $78.44 and the Dollar
Index was down 0.4 percent.  The Fed pledged for the first time to keep its benchmark
interest rate at a record low at least through mid-2013 in a bid
to revive the flagging recovery after a worldwide stock rout.
The  Federal Open Market Committee  discussed a range of
policy tools to bolster the economy and said it is “prepared to
employ these tools as appropriate,” it said in a statement
today in Washington. Three members of the FOMC dissented,
preferring to maintain the pledge to keep rates low for an
“extended period.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
