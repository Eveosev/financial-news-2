The new president of the Spanish
region of Castilla-La Mancha has halted work on a hospital and a
university campus,  El Pais  reported, without citing anyone.  Maria Dolores de Cospedal, the Peopleâ€™s Party president of
the region, stopped the projects because other issues are of
greater priority, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
