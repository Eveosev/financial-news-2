The Kenyan financial-industry’s
pretax  profit  climbed 17 percent to 40.8 billion shillings
($436.1 million) through June as loan income rose, and growth
may continue in the second half, the central bank said.  Assets managed by the industry increased 27 percent to 1.9
trillion shillings in the first half, compared with the same
period a year earlier, the Nairobi-based  Central Bank of Kenya 
said in a statement on its website today. Gross non-performing
loans declined to 5.4 percent of total loans, compared with 7.4
percent a year earlier, the statement said.  “The sector is expected to continue its growth momentum
into the second half of 2011,” it said. “The momentum will be
sustained by opportunities in regional markets.”  Profitability has improved for most banks in East Africa’s
largest economy even as the Nairobi Stock Exchange All-Share
Index has fallen 16 percent this year as investors seek fixed-
income securities with better returns amid rising inflation.  The stock of Equity Bank Ltd.,  Kenya ’s biggest lender by
market value which reported a 57 percent increase in first-half
profit to 4.7 billion shillings, has dropped 17 percent in the
period.  The financial-services industry in Kenya comprises 43
commercial banks, 1 mortgage-finance company, 6 micro-finance
institutions, 2 credit reference bureaus, 3 representative
offices and 124 foreign exchange bureaus, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
