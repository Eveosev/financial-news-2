Turkey  may import 150,000 metric tons
of rice this marketing season with its own production seen at
800,000 tons, the country’s Rice Millers Association said.  In the season from September through June, Turkey imported
334,480 tons of paddy rice, Turgay Yetis, the association’s
president, said today at an international grains conference in
Rostov-on-Don, southwestern  Russia . The U.S. was the largest
supplier, with 178,420 tons, followed by Russia, which shipped
111,579 tons, he said.  Turkey accounted for 70 percent of Russia’s rice exports in
2010 and 90 percent in the first seven months of 2011, according
to the Moscow-based Institute for Agricultural Market Studies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
