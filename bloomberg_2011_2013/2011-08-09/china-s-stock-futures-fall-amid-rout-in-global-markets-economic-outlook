Most Chinese stocks fell after the
U.S. debt downgrade boosted concern the global economic recovery
will stall and  China ’s inflation rate rose by the fastest pace
in three years.  PetroChina Co., the nation’s biggest oil producer, slid to
a record low after crude prices had their biggest two-day plunge
in more than two years. Cosco Shipping Co. led shipping
companies lower on concern global trade will be curtailed.
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and China Vanke Co.
led gains for financial companies on speculation declines were
excessive relative to the outlook for earnings.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, declined 0.75 point, or less than 0.1
percent, to 2,526.07 at the 3 p.m. close, erasing a drop of as
much as 3.5 percent. About five stocks retreated for every three
that gained. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  rose 0.2 percent to 2,798.19.  “Economic turmoil may drag down the stock market for the
short term,” said Sun Zhanjun, a  fund manager  at Bosera Asset
Management Co., which oversees more than $29 billion. “It may
keep fluctuating at a bottom for some time.”  The Shanghai gauge has tumbled 20 percent from a November
high, signaling a so-called bear market. The measure trades at a
record-low 11.6 times estimated earnings, according to weekly
data compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s consumer prices climbed 6.5 percent from a year
earlier as food costs surged, reports from the Beijing-based
National Bureau of Statistics showed today. That was more than
the 6.4 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 26
economists. In June, inflation was 6.4 percent.  Rate Outlook  “This is the kind of data that should trigger an interest
rate hike, but the uncertainties in global financial markets may
delay the action,” said Yao Wei, a Hong Kong-based economist
with Societe Generale SA.  Two-year swap contracts based on the People’s Bank of
China’s one-year deposit rate fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.585 percent in Shanghai. That reflects
expectations policy makers will raise  interest rates  no more
than once in the coming 12 months. The central bank has raised
interest rates five times and ordered lenders to set aside more
cash as deposit reserves 12 times since the start of 2010 to
contain price rises.  PetroChina lost 1 percent to 9.76 yuan, the lowest since
its listing in November 2007. Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. slid 2.1
percent to 30.15 yuan.  Crude for September delivery fell as much as 6.9 percent to
$75.71 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest intraday price since Sept. 29. It was at
$77.90 at 2:19 p.m. Sydney time. Prices declined as much as 13
percent the past two days, the most since Jan. 8, 2009.  QE3  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 6.7 percent yesterday,
the most since December 2008, while the MSCI All-Country World
Index tumbled 5.1 percent, a ninth day of losses. Yesterday’s
rout wiped out about $2.5 trillion in global equity values,
extending the total loss in market values since July 26 to $7.8
trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Federal Reserve policy makers will hold a one-day meeting
today as the unprecedented downgrade of the U.S.’s top credit
rating fuels speculation America is headed for a recession.  The Fed is likely to embark on a third round of large-scale
asset purchases, moving “more decisively” to secure the U.S.
recovery, said Harvard University economist  Kenneth Rogoff .  Cosco Shipping lost 1.3 percent to 5.99 yuan, the lowest
since July 5, 2010. China Cosco Holdings Co. sank 0.9 percent to
a record low.  Trade Concerns  China’s exports will be hurt “badly” should the U.S. debt
rating downgrade spur a slowdown in the global economy,
according to Credit Suisse Group AG. Shipments to developed
nations accounted for 58 percent of total exports in the first
half of the year, Vincent Chan and Peggy Chan, Hong Kong-based
analysts at Credit Suisse, wrote in a report yesterday.  China Vanke, the nation’s largest developer, rose 3 percent
to 8.30 yuan, the most since June 14. The company reported net
income increased 5.9 percent in the first half from a year
earlier, according to a statement yesterday. Poly Real Estate
Group Co. jumped 3.9 percent to 10.84 yuan.  A gauge tracking 34 developers on the Shanghai Composite
added 2.5 percent, the most since June 30. The measure trades at
11.1 times estimated earnings, the lowest since November 2008,
according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg News. ICBC, the
biggest lender, climbed 1.7 percent to 4.10 yuan. Huaxia Bank Co.
advanced 2.1 percent to 9.75 yuan.  Chinese stocks’ tumble into a  bear market  is creating
opportunities to buy banks and property developers that are
undervalued based on the outlook for profit, according to
China’s second-best performing fund manager.  “Chinese companies should have higher valuations given the
nation’s economic growth, and the slump offers a good time to
get in,” Wang Weidong, Beijing-based manager of the $335
million New China Growth Equity Fund, said in an interview.
“Earnings growth alone could be a good enough reason.”  China’s industrial output rose 14 percent in July from a
year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said after
the market close today. That compares with the 14.6 percent
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 23 economists and
a 15.1 percent gain the previous month. Fixed-asset investment
excluding rural households climbed 25.4 percent in the first
seven months from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
