The remains of the U.S. special
operations troops killed when their helicopter was shot down in
 Afghanistan  arrived today at Dover Air Force Base in  Delaware ,
Marine Colonel David Lapan, a Defense Department spokesman,
said.  The 30 dead included 22 U.S. Navy SEAL commandos, most from
the elite unit once known as SEAL Team Six that carried out the
May raid that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in
Abbottabad,  Pakistan , two U.S. officials said Aug. 7 on
condition of anonymity.  None of those killed were from the SEAL Team Six squadron
involved in the bin Laden raid, they said. The SEAL team is now
formally known as the Naval Special Warfare Development Group.  The Afghanistan helicopter crash was the biggest loss of
U.S. troops in a single engagement since the start of the war in
October 2001. Seven Afghan commandos and a civilian interpreter
were also killed.  Because the remains haven’t been specifically identified
and family members aren’t in position to grant public access to
the transfer, the arrival was closed under Defense Department
policy, Lapan said. The bodies will be identified at the
 military mortuary  at Dover, according to a Pentagon statement
yesterday.  NATO said the helicopter carrying the special operations
troops was destroyed as it was flying into a firefight that had
targeted a Taliban leader.  NATO suspects that the CH-47 was downed by an unguided
rocket-propelled grenade, not a more advanced heat-seeking
shoulder-fired missile that might have indicated a new level of
Taliban capability, Lapan said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
