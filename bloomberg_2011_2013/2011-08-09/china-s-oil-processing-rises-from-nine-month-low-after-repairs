China ’s daily oil processing
rebounded from the lowest in nine months after some plants
completed maintenance and privately run refineries boosted
output on cheaper costs.  Processing volumes climbed 5.9 percent from a year earlier
to 37.49 million metric tons in July, or 8.86 million barrels a
day, according to data released by the China Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing today. This compares with 8.69 million
barrels a day in June, and a record 9.22 million barrels a day
in February.  China’s biggest oil refineries operated at an average 79.4
percent of capacity in the first two weeks of July as some
plants resumed operations after seasonal repairs, Shandong-based
Oilchem.net reported on July 15. Lower fuel-oil import tariffs
prompted privately held refineries to increase processing,
Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday, citing an unidentified
official at the National Development and Reform Commission.  Gasoline output gained 3.4 percent from a year earlier to
6.54 million tons last month. Diesel production rose 4.3 percent
to 13.99 million tons and kerosene climbed 8.5 percent to 1.63
million tons, according to today’s data.  The nation’s industrial output advanced 14 percent in July
from a year earlier, compared with the 14.6 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 23 economists and a 15.1
percent gain in the previous month, the National Bureau of
Statistics said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
