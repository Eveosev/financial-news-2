Gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  rose as BP
Plc reported an exchanger leak in an ultraformer at its Texas
City refinery in Texas.  “Once the exchanger is identified, it will be isolated
away from the process for repair/replacement procedures,” the
company said in a filing with the  Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality .  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.75 cent to 9.75 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:09
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
gained 4.46 cents to $2.6312 a gallon.  Colonial Pipeline Co., which operates the largest pipeline
linking the Gulf Coast to U.S. East Coast markets, allocated
gasoline shipments on its Line 1 north of Collins,  Mississippi ,
for Cycle 46, according to a bulletin to shippers.  The discount for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in New York Harbor, narrowed 0.13 cent to 1
cent a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
