Huntsman Corp. (HUN)  Chief Executive
Officer Peter Huntsman said he spent $1.1 million to buy 100,000
shares of the company yesterday because the stock price is
“ridiculously low.”  The shares tumbled 38 percent through yesterday after the
chemicals producer reported second-quarter profit on Aug. 4 that
trailed analyst’s estimates by 1 cent a share. Adjusted earnings
were the third best in the company’s history, as sales volumes
and earnings rose, Huntsman said today in an interview.  “You miss Wall Street estimates by 1 penny and you lose a
third of your value,” said Peter Huntsman, whose brother Jon
Huntsman Jr. is seeking the Republican presidential nomination.
“I don’t understand how that happens.”  Huntsman, which is run from  Salt Lake City  and The
Woodlands,  Texas , intends to fulfill its Aug. 5 announcement to
spend as much as $100 million buying back shares, the CEO said.  Huntsman rose $1.73, or 15 percent, to $12.94 as of 1:02
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading after rising
as much as 17 percent, the biggest intraday gain since March
2009.  Jon M. Huntsman Sr., the company’s founder and chairman,
paid $2.3 million for 200,000 shares yesterday, according to a
filing. The Huntsman family is the largest shareholder in the
company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Herd Mentality’  The decline in global markets in the past week has been an
overreaction to economic concerns aggravated by a “herd
mentality” among investors with “fresh memories” of the 2008
financial crisis, he said.  “I have yet to see where we have fallen off a cliff as we
did in 2008,” Huntsman said. “We continue to see stable market
conditions to gradually growing market conditions around the
world.”  U.S. political leaders, particularly President  Barack Obama ,
have failed to reassure markets and the public about the
country’s economic direction, he said.  “We have a dysfunctional leadership in the country as far
as handling of fiscal issues,” Huntsman said. “You just don’t
get a sense that anybody is in charge right now. That is
dispiriting to Americans.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
