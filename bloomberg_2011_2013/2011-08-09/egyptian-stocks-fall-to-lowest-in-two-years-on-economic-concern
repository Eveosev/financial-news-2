Egyptian stocks plunged to their
lowest in more than two years as international investors
withdrew money amid concern the global economic recovery is
faltering.  Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  declined 4.8 percent to
4,478 at the 1:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the lowest level since
April 2009. The  EGX 100 Index (EGX100)  had earlier lost 5.1 percent,
triggering a 30-minute trading suspension.  “We’ve traditionally had one of the highest exposure
levels to foreign investors, which is why we tend to be more
impacted by volatility in international markets,” said Wafik
Dawood, director of institutional sales at Mega Investments
Securities in Cairo. “We’re in a free fall after breaking the
4,800 level and it would be hard to predict now where it ends.”  Egyptian shares have lost 11 percent in the last three
days. That compares with a 6.3 percent drop in Dubai’s benchmark
 DFM General Index (DFMGI)  and a 1.2 percent decline in Bahrain over the
same period. Non-Egyptian investors were  net sellers  of shares
valued at about 43 million Egyptian pounds ($7 million) today,
according to Egyptian Exchange data.  The country’s benchmark index has lost 20 percent from a
June 19 peak. A decline of 20 percent or more signals a so-
called  bear market  to some investors.  Orascom Construction
Industries (OCIC) , Egypt’s biggest publicly traded builder, fell 5.7
percent to 231.01 pounds, the biggest decline since March 23.
 Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE (COMI) , the country’s biggest
publicly traded lender, retreated 4.2 percent to 24.72 pounds,
the lowest level in two years.  Egypt’s economy may contract 3.3 percent this year, instead
of an earlier estimate of 2.5 percent, EFG-Hermes Holding SAE,
the country’s biggest publicly traded investment bank, said in a
statement today.  U.S. Federal Reserve policy makers will meet today to
discuss ways to restore investor confidence after the credit
rating of the U.S. was cut to AA+ from AAA for the first time by
 Standard & Poor’s  on Aug. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
