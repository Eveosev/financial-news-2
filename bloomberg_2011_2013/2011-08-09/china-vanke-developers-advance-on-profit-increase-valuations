China Vanke Co. led gains by the
nation’s developers on speculation recent losses were overdone
relative to earnings prospects.  China Vanke, the nation’s largest developer by market
value, rose 2.1 percent to 8.23  yuan  as of 11:16 a.m. in
Shenzhen, the most since July 1. The company reported net income
rose 5.9 percent in the first half from a year earlier,
according to a statement yesterday.  Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048) 
jumped 4.1 percent to 10.86 yuan. Gemdale Corp. climbed 2.5
percent to 6.17 yuan.  “The earnings growth gives investors some confidence in
developers,” said Tu Lilei, an analyst at Haitong Securities
Co. in Shanghai. “Valuations have fallen to a fairly low level
so there’s limited room for further declines.’  A gauge tracking 34 developers in the Shanghai Composite
Index trades at 11 times estimated earnings, the lowest since
November 2008, according to weekly data compiled by  Bloomberg
News . The index added 1.3 percent, the only advance among the
