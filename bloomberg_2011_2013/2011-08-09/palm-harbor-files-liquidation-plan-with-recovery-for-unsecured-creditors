Palm Harbor Homes Inc. (PHHM) , a U.S.
builder of factory-made houses, filed a liquidation plan
supported by unsecured creditors who would receive a recovery of
as much as 21 percent.  Palm Harbor won court approval in March to sell virtually
all of its assets to a joint venture of  Cavco Industries Inc. (CVCO) 
and Third Avenue Value Fund for about $85.3 million.  “The primary purpose of the plan is to provide for the
orderly liquidation and distribution of the assets,” the
company said in its disclosure statement, a description of the
plan filed Aug. 5 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington,
Delaware. The plan gives creditors “the best recoveries
possible,” Palm Harbor said.  The homebuilder, based in Addison,  Texas , sought bankruptcy
protection Nov. 29, listing assets of $321.3 million and debt of
$280.3 million as of Oct. 29.  Under the plan, a trust would be created to distribute cash
and liquidate any remaining assets, court papers show. Holders
of 3.25 percent senior notes, owed about $54.8 million, and
general unsecured creditors would get as much as 21 percent on
their claims.  Holders of Palm Harbor stock, which traded at $2.15 a share
a year ago, wouldn’t receive any recovery.  The company scheduled a Sept. 13 hearing to seek court
approval of the disclosure statement.  The case is In re  Palm Harbor Homes Inc. (PHHMQ) , 10-13850, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
