Rockhopper Exploration Plc (RKH) , the only
oil explorer to make a potentially commercial discovery in the
Falkland Islands, surged the most in more than a year after an
appraisal well met the “upper end of expectations.”  Rockhopper climbed 48 percent to close at 209 pence in
London in its biggest gain since May 2010.  The 14/10-5 well at the Sea Lion field confirmed that the
deposit is commercially viable, the Salisbury, England-based
company said today in a statement. “The results of this well
are at the upper end of expectations for the Sea Lion main fan
complex,” Chief Executive Officer Sam Moody said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
