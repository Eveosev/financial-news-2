Mauritian stocks headed for their
lowest close in almost eight months and the rupee slid to a
three-week low, as concern about a slowing global economy
prompted investors to turn away from emerging market assets.  The 38-member SEMDEX gauge of the official market declined
as much as 3.9 percent, and was down 2.5 percent at 1,894.14 at
12:56 p.m., in  Port Louis , the capital. A close at this level
will be the lowest since November 2010, according to Bloomberg
data. The currency of the Indian Ocean island nation depreciated
for a fifth consecutive day against the dollar, weakening 0.1
percent to 28.1550 per dollar, its lowest since Aug. 8.  The drop in Mauritian stocks was led by  New Mauritius
Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the country’s largest leisure operator by market
value, which slumped 5.9 percent or 5.5 rupees to 88 rupees.
 State Bank of Mauritius Ltd. (SBM) , the island’s second-largest lender
by market value, retreated 2.8 percent, or 2.5 rupees, to 87.5
rupees.  European stocks are on their longest losing since streak
since 2003, dropping for an eighth day, and Asian shares fell,
following  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of its U.S rating to AA+,
debt turmoil in major economies and rising inflation in  China .  “Markets are waking up to the stark reality that the
global economy is in worse shape than previously thought”,
analysts at Mauritius Commercial Bank said in an e-mailed
research note today. “In the short to medium term, fear is
expected to drive markets”.  Mauritius, with a population of 1.3 million people, is an
open-market economy, with almost two thirds of arriving tourists
coming from  Europe . Europe is also the biggest buyer of locally
manufactured exports, according to the  Central Statistics
Office . While 41 percent of the country’s foreign currency
income is in euros, about 67 percent of its import costs are in
dollars, according to the Bank of Mauritius.  Buying prices for the dollar were from 27.3711 to 27.5362
rupees, with the selling price declining to 28.8366 from 28.7504
rupees per dollar, according to rates published on the  Bank of
Mauritius  website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
