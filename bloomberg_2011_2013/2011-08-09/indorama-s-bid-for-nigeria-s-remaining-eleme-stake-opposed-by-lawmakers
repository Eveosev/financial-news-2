Indorama Group’s bid for  Nigeria ’s
remaining stake in Eleme Petrochemicals Co. Ltd was opposed by
lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing today in Abuja, the
capital.  A deal was agreed to sell the government’s 5 percent
holding in the company to Indorama for 4.2 billion naira ($27.5
million), Bolanle Onagoruwa, head of the Bureau of Public
Enterprises, the privatization agency, told a parliamentary
committee investigating the sale of state companies today.   Lawmakers want the government retain its interest in the
company since it’s making profit, Ahmed Lawan, chairman of the
committee said. “Indorama should have their money back.”   Indorama bought 75 percent of the company, which was a unit
of state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., in 2005 for
$235 million. Eleme Petrochemicals became profitable two years
later, Onagoruwa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
