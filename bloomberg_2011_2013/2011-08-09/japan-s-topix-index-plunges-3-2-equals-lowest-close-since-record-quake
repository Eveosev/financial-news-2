Japan ’s Topix Index fell 3.2 percent
to 757.86, set for the lowest close since March 2009 amid a
global equity-market rout spurred by  Standard & Poor’s  cutting
of the U.S. debt rating.  The Topix is now trading below the March 15 closing low of
766.73, which marked the bottom-most close following the
country’s record earthquake.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
