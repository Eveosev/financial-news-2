India ’s stock-index futures plunged
to a more than two-month low, signaling a slump in benchmark
indexes, amid a selloff in global equities.  SGX S&P CNX Nifty Index futures for August delivery
declined 228.5 points, or 4.5 percent, to 4,905 at 10:40 a.m. in
 Singapore , the lowest level since May 30. The futures are
derived from the 50 stocks on the underlying S&P CNX Nifty Index
on the National Stock Exchange of India, which fell 1.8 percent
to 5,118.50 yesterday. The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange
Sensitive Index lost 1.8 percent to 16,990.18, the lowest level
in 14 months.  Asian stocks dropped for a sixth day and oil sank below $80
a barrel amid concern the loss of the U.S.’s AAA rating will
exacerbate a slowing global recovery. The MSCI Asia Pacific
Index lost 2.8 percent as of 9:43 a.m. in  Tokyo , adding to a
five-day slump. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures slid 1
percent, while  South Korea ’s Kospi Index dropped 5.6 percent.  “The U.S. and Euro problems add to near-term uncertainty
which will lead to range-bound movement in our markets,” Dinesh Thakkar, chairman and managing director of Angel Broking Ltd.
“Markets could be re-calibrated a little lower since growth
prospects in the near-term look a little weaker.”  The Sensex slid as much as 3.2 percent in intra-day trade
yesterday, extending losses from a Nov. 5 peak to 20 percent. A
decline of 20 percent or more signals a so-called  bear market  to
some investors. The  S&P 500  fell 6.7 percent yesterday, the most
since December 2008.  Yesterday’s rout wiped out about $2.5 trillion in global
equity values, extending the total loss in market values since
July 26 to $7.8 trillion, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  -- Editor: Arijit Ghosh  To contact the reporters on this story:
