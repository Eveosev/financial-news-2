Nigerian banks fell for an 11th day,
sending the industry gauge to a 30-month low, as authorities to
took steps to stabilize lenders and speculation deepened that
the global economic recovery is faltering.  The  Bloomberg NSE Banking (NGSEB10)  Index, which tracks performance
of the 10 most capitalized banks in the industry, lost 4.3
percent to 303.65, the lowest since Jan. 30, 2009, at the 2:30
p.m. close in Lagos. The Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index
fell 1.9 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Developing-nation stocks tumbled for the sixth day after
the downgrade of the U.S.’s top credit rating prompted investors
to sell riskier assets. Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer,
will inject 679 billion naira ($4.5 billion) into three
nationalized banks after the central bank said they were
unlikely to meet the September deadline to recapitalize, Asset
Management Corp. of Nigeria said yesterday.  “Global and domestic sentiments are not positive at this
point in time,” Adesoji Solanke, a Lagos-based banking analyst
with  Renaissance Capital , said by phone today. “Nigerian
banking stocks are the most liquid, so if there’s going to be a
sell-off or a rally, they will be the most-affected.”  Zenith Bank Plc (ZENITHBA) , the country’s biggest lender by market
value, lost 5 percent to 12.28 naira.  Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) ,
the second-largest, declined 4.9 percent to 11.97 naira.  Crude for September delivery traded little changed at
$81.44 a barrel in  New York  today, after tumbling as much as 6.9
percent to $75.71, a 10-month low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
