Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive
officer of Sunvin Group, comments on the outlook for  palm oil 
after prices dropped to a nine-month low today.  Palm oil for October delivery lost as much as 2.5 percent
to 2,920 ringgit ($959) per metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the lowest level since Oct. 20. Futures
fell as the global rout in equities and crude oil deepened on
concern that the U.S. credit-rating downgrade will exacerbate a
slowing global economy.  Bajoria, who’s been trading vegetable oils for 30 years,
spoke in a phone interview from Mumbai.  On outlook for prices:  “Right now, there is a downward pressure on palm oil. In
the next 60 days, prices will range from 2,800 ringgit to 3,000
ringgit a ton.  ‘‘Prices will depend on whether the global meltdown
persists and liquidity gets tight. If liquidity gets tight, we
will see a further fall of 200 ringgit.’’  On Indian imports:  ‘‘We will be importing a good quantity of palm oil, of at
least 700,000 tons a month. The total for August to October will
be 2 million tons.  ‘‘For the oil year ending Oct. 31, the total palm oil
imports will be 6.7 million tons.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
