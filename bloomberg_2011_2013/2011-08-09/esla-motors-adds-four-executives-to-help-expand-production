Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)  hired four vice
presidents as the electric-car maker seeks to expand output,
develops its Model S sedan model and aims to win a supply deal
with  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)   The four executives were hired from outside Tesla, Khobi Brooklyn, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The new vice
presidents are Greg Reichow for powertrain operations; Peter
Carlsson, supply chain; Ravi Simhambhatla, information
technology; and John Hillegass, design and retail development.  Toyota agreed last month to pay Tesla about $100 million to
supply battery packs and motors for use in Toyota’s electric
RAV4 sport-utility vehicle that goes on sale next year. Tesla
and Toyota are in talks for another contract for “an order of
magnitude larger than that,” Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk
said on an Aug. 3 conference call.  That deal may be as large as $1 billion, Edmunds
AutoObserver reported the next day, citing a Tesla executive it
didn’t identify.  Tesla, based in  Palo Alto , California, also assembles
lithium-ion battery packs used in rechargeable versions of
 Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Smart minicar and Mercedes-Benz A-class hatchback.
Toyota and Daimler are shareholders in Tesla.  Tesla rose $1.42, or 6 percent, to $25.06 a share at 4 p.m.
in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
