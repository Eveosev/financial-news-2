Showers associated with the remnants
of the Atlantic storm Emily east of  Bermuda  decreased today, and
the system has a 20 percent chance of becoming a tropical
cyclone within 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center said.  The system 650 miles (1,045 kilometers) from Bermuda is
moving eastward-northeastward at about 30 miles per hour, the
Miami-based center said in an  advisory  at 8 a.m. New York time.
Conditions are not conducive for much development, it said.  Emily, the fifth named storm of this yearâ€™s Atlantic
hurricane season, weakened into a depression the past weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
