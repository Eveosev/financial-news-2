Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in Taiwan trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 1:30 p.m. in Taipei.  The Taiex Index fell 59.68, or 0.8 percent, to 7,493.12,
taking its six-day slump to 14 percent, the steepest sell-off
since September 2001. The gauge pared losses of as much as 5.4
percent today that had dragged the index down as much as 22
percent from its Jan. 28 high. A decline of 20 percent or more
signals a so-called  bear market  to some investors.  Philip Yang, a Cabinet spokesman, said the government
bought equities yesterday and this morning through four funds it
controls.  AU Optronics Corp. (2409)  (2409 TT) slumped 6 percent to NT$12.45,
the lowest close since Oct. 14, 2002. The island’s second-
largest flat panel maker said preliminary consolidated July
revenue fell 16 percent from a year earlier to NT$33 billion
($1.1 billion).  HTC Corp. (2498)  (2498 TT) retreated 1.3 percent to NT$786, the
lowest close since Nov. 18. A patent-infringement complaint by
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  against HTC will be reviewed by the U.S.
International Trade Commission, which has the power to block
imports of the Taiwanese company’s phones and new Flyer tablet
computers.  HTC will fully cooperate with the ITC’s investigation and
looks forward to showing that it is not in violation of any of
Apple’s patents, Grace Lei, the general counsel at HTC, said in
an e-mail.  Siliconware Precision Industries Co. (2325)  (2325 TT) advanced 2.5
percent to NT$25, the biggest gain since July 22. The chip-
packaging and testing company said in a statement it would buy
back 50 million shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
