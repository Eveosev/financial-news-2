Amtrak  said delays are expected to
continue on all Amtrak Northeast Corridor  service  between Boston
and  Washington  for the rest of the afternoon following a slow-
speed derailment of a New Jersey Transit commuter train near
 Penn Station  in  New York  at about 8 a.m., according to a company
statement.  Crews continue to work to clear the affected equipment from
the tracks, with no estimate for complete restoration of service
available at this time, according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
