Indian stocks may stay volatile for
the next few days and there isn’t any shortage of money to fund
equity transactions, a  finance ministry  official said.  “We see no payment pressures in the Indian stock market,”
Thomas Mathew, joint secretary in charge of capital markets in
the finance ministry, told reporters in New Delhi today. “In
the medium-term there will be good inflows.”  India ’s finance ministry hasn’t directed government-run
companies to buy stocks to support the market, Mathews said,
even as state-run funds in South Korea and Taiwan bought shares
today. The global equity market rout has erased about $7.8
trillion from stocks worldwide over the past two weeks.  “When global uncertainties are pretty high, markets will
remain volatile,” said Kaushik Dani, a Mumbai-based  fund
manager  at Peerless Mutual Fund, which has $1.1 billion in
stocks and bonds.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index fell 0.5 percent
at 3:20 p.m. in Mumbai after declining as much as 3.3 percent
earlier in the day. The rupee weakened 0.6 percent to 45.25 per
dollar. The yield on the 7.8 percent bond due April 2021 fell 5
basis points, or 0.5 percentage point, to 8.20 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
