Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said some current and former
employees are the target of a criminal complaint in  South Korea 
related to sales of collateralized debt obligations.  Heungkuk Life Insurance Co. “filed a criminal complaint
against certain past and present employees of the firm in South
Korea relating to its purchase of a CDO securitization from
Goldman Sachs,” New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today.  Heungkuk Life and Heungkuk Fire & Marine Insurance Co.
filed a complaint to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’
office on June 28 against nine Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
executives and employees, accusing them of fraud, Lee Yun No, an
official at Heungkuk Life, said by phone on July 5.  The Korean companies have seen losses from purchasing
collateralized debt obligations in 2007 from Goldman Sachs, Lee
said, without elaborating.  Goldman Sachs confirmed the complaint for the first time
publicly in today’s quarterly submission to the SEC.  The complaint “does not represent any judgment by a
governmental entity, but starts a process whereby the prosecutor
investigates the complaint and determines whether to take
action,” Goldman Sachs said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
