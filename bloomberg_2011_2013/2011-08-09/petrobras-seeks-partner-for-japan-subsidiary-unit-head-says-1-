Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the  oil
company  with the world’s largest investment plan, may sell a
stake in its Japanese business while it focuses on developing
deep-water fields in  Brazil .  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based company is known, is
talking to potential partners, including Japanese and foreign
companies, for its Nansei Sekiyu K.K. subsidiary, Osvaldo
Kawakami, head of the unit, told reporters today in  Salvador ,
Brazil. Kawakami declined to give details of the size of the
stake to be sold.  “We are considering to have some partners so that they
could invest in Nansei Sekiyu,” Kawakami said. “We are
concentrating more investments in pre-salt Brazil.”  Petrobras plans to raise $13.6 billion from asset sales and
cost cuts to help finance $224.7 billion in investments through
2015, the world’s biggest oil industry spending plan. Petrobras
is developing the largest crude discoveries in the Americas in
more than three decades, which lie miles beneath the floor of
the Atlantic Ocean in a region known as the pre-salt.  Petrobras bought 87.5 percent of Nansei Sekiyu, which has a
100,00 barrel-a-day refinery, from Exxon Mobil Corp. in 2008 for
$50 million. Petrobras bought the remaining 12.5 percent stake
from Sumitomo Corp. in 2010 for an undisclosed amount, according
to Sumitomo’s  website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
