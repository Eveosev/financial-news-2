Colombia ’s peso rose the most in a
week against the U.S. dollar on speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will act to revive confidence in the economy.  The peso erased earlier declines, strengthening 0.2 percent
to 1,811.9 per dollar at 2:24 p.m. New York time, from 1,814.72
yesterday. Earlier it touched 1,817.35, the weakest level since
May 30.  Colombia’s currency closed before the Fed pledged to keep
its benchmark interest rate at a record low at least through the
middle of 2013 in a bid to ignite the flagging economic recovery
after a worldwide stock rout. The Federal Open Market Committee
is ready to deploy a range of policy tools “as appropriate,”
the body said in a statement released today in  Washington .  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.64
percent, according to data compiled by the nation’s stock
exchange. The bond’s price rose 0.531 centavo to 118.964
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
