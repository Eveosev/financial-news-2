The  Communications Workers of
America , which represents 35,000 workers at  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ)  out on strike, appealed to Congress for
support in the labor dispute.  “We ask you to write Verizon President Lowell McAdam and
urge him to respect collective bargaining rights,” the union
said in a letter today.  The CWA appealed to Congressional offices from districts in
the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, where about 45,000
unionized workers began striking Sunday. The International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers represents about 12,500
additional Verizon workers on strike.  Verizon, the second-largest U.S. phone company, today also
sent a letter to Congressional offices in affected districts as
well as leaders in both houses of Congress.  “The world is changing,” the New York-based company said.
“Verizon and its union-represented employees need to work
together to adjust rules and policies that threaten to limit the
company’s ability to compete in the broadband marketplace. This
is hard, but it is doable.”  Verizon rose $1.17, or 3.5 percent, to $34.29 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are
down 4.2 percent this year. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
jumped 4.7 percent to 1,172.53, its biggest gain since March
2009, after tumbling 6.7 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
