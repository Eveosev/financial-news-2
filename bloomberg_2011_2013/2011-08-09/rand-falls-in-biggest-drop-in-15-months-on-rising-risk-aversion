The rand weakened to the lowest in
almost 18 months against the euro and the pound after a rout in
equities fueled concern the global recovery will falter.  South Africa ’s currency slumped 2.9 percent to 10.4090
against the euro as of 5:12 p.m. in Johannesburg, the lowest
level since Feb. 26, 2010, on a closing basis. The rand declined
1.9 percent to 11.858 against the pound, the weakest since Feb.
25, 2010. The currency fell 2.9 percent to 7.3199 against the
dollar, the lowest since Aug. 31. Local markets in South Africa
are closed today for a public holiday.  Developing-nation stocks tumbled for the sixth day, sending
the benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Index down almost 20 percent
from this year’s high. Fed policy makers meet today after the
downgrade of the U.S.’s top credit rating prompted investors to
sell riskier assets.  “People are starting to close their risky moves and
positions,”  Gaelle Blanchard , an emerging markets analyst at
 Societe Generale  in  London , said by phone today. “Usually the
rand is very sensitive to risk indicators, just gold in itself
is not enough to save it from what’s going on and I guess it’s
very much amplified by the market holiday there.”  Gold, which along with platinum, accounts for about 20
percent of South Africa’s export earnings, rose as much as 3.5
percent, to an all-time high of $1,780.10.  South Africa remains “confident” about its projections
for economic growth and the  budget deficit  even as risks to the
global economy increased following the U.S. debt downgrade, the
National Treasury and Reserve Bank said in a joint statement
yesterday. Growth and fiscal projections will be updated in the
mid-term budget due in October, they said.  The nation’s economy is forecast to expand 3.7 percent this
year, the  Reserve Bank ’s Governor Gill Marcus said July 21.  “From a week ago domestically there’s no big change that
could trigger this, it’s really just market fears,” Blanchard
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
