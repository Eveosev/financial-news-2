South Korea â€™s finance ministry said
it will fend off any foreign-exchange liquidity crunch after the
U.S. credit rating downgrade and declines in global financial
markets.  The ministry said in a report submitted to parliament that
it will closely monitor interest rates, the currency and
liquidity, and take prompt action with other agencies if needed.
The government will try to maintain its fiscal soundness and
sovereign rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
