FIFA , soccer’s governing body, has
given lifetime bans to seven game officials following a match-
fixing inquiry into exhibition games earlier this year.  The probe concerned games held Feb. 9 in Antalya,  Turkey .
Estonia and Bulgaria tied 2-2 and Latvia beat Bolivia 2-1, with
all seven goals coming from penalty kicks.  The soccer body’s disciplinary panel imposed the sanction
against four Hungarians and three Bosnians following a hearing
at its headquarters in Zurich.  Police have arrested people in Asia, Europe and Africa for
rigging matches. The start of the Turkish league has been
delayed amid a police inquiry there and FIFA has uncovered
several national team games that may have been compromised,
including  Nigeria ’s 4-1 victory over Argentina in an exhibition
match on June 1.  The illegal gambling market is estimated to be worth $90
billion, according to the World Lottery Association, a lobbying
group for state-backed lotteries  To contact the reporter on this story:
