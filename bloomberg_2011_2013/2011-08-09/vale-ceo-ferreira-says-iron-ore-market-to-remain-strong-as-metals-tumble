Vale SA (VALE5) , the world´s largest iron-ore
producer, expects prices for the steelmaking material to remain
“strong” because of demand in emerging countries such as China
and  India , Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira said.  Iron-ore prices aren’t changing amid the rout in equities
and commodities markets worldwide, Ferreira said today in an
interview in  Salvador , in the Northeastern Brazilian state of
Bahia. Nations with large populations and rising middle classes
will continue to demand commodities, he said.  “These countries have a big hunger for raw-materials so I
believe the market will continue strong,” Ferreira said on the
sidelines of an economic seminar between Brazilian and Japanese
businessmen. “If we continue this trend, we will have the third
consecutive quarter without altering prices,” he said.  Prices for iron-ore sold by Vale averaged $145.30 a metric
ton during the second-quarter, an increase of 58 percent from
the same period a year earlier, the company said July 28. The
price of ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to  China ,
which gained about 71 percent in the past two years, fell less
than 1 percent to $177.8 a metric ton today, according to Steel
Business Briefing Commodities Research.  Vale gained 1.86 reais, or 5.1 percent, to 38.40 reais in
Sao Paulo trading today amid a market rebound in Brazilian
stocks. The stock has fallen 20 percent so far this year, less
than the 26 percent loss for the Brazilian benchmark Bovespa
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
