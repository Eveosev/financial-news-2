Taiwan ’s dollar touched a 16-week low
and sovereign bonds advanced as investors favored the perceived
safety of government debt on concern the global recovery is
stalling.  Foreign funds slashed their holdings of the island’s shares
by $1.1 billion today, the heaviest net sales in almost four
years, exchange data show. The benchmark  stock index  fell 0.8
percent, taking its loss for the past six days to 14.7 percent,
exchange data show. Five-year bond yields touched a four-month
low after  Standard & Poor’s  unprecedented downgrade of the U.S.
credit rating on Aug. 5 fueled speculation the world’s largest
economy is headed for a recession.  “People are panicking after the U.S. rating downgrade,”
said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Polaris
Securities Co. “Investors are shifting to safer assets like
bonds.”  Taiwan’s dollar declined 0.1 percent to NT$29.050 against
its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$29.105 earlier, the
weakest level since April 20.  The yield on the 2 percent notes due July 2016, the most-
traded government debt, fell to 1.101 percent from 1.104 percent
yesterday, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. The rate
reached 1.058 percent earlier.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.387 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
