Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s third
worst-performer this year, declined to the lowest in at least 18
years against the dollar, driven by corporate demand for the
U.S. currency.  The shilling fell 1.4 percent to 2,733 per dollar at 4.50
p.m. in the capital, Kampala, the lowest intraday level since at
least June 22, 1993, according to Bloomberg data. It closed at
2,695 yesterday.  “The weakening was caused by huge demand for the dollar by
one of the corporate firms against low inflows,” Lucas Ochieng,
a currency trader at Orient Bank Ltd. said by phone from Kampala
without giving details.  A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a more
than 18-year high of 18.7 percent last month from 15.7 percent
in June, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said on July 29.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer has
slumped 15.5 percent this year, the steepest decline after the
Maldives rufiyaa and Suriname dollar, which fell 16.5 percent
and 16.8 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
