Moritz Kraemer, the head of European
sovereign ratings at  Standard & Poor’s , told  Handelsblatt  that
the rating outlook for the U.K. and  France  is stable and the
firm doesn’t expect to downgrade the two countries within the
next two years.  Commenting on the U.S. downgrade, he told Handelsblatt that
the company’s mission isn’t to calm the markets and that S&P
must name the risks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
