Irving Picard , the trustee for 
Bernard Madoff's former firm, doesn’t have standing to pursue 
common-law claims against UniCredit Bank Austria AG, a unit of 
 UniCredit Spa (UCG) , Italy’s biggest bank, a federal judge ruled.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in  New York  on Aug. 6 added
UniCredit Bank Austria to a July 28 opinion barring Picard from
pursuing some claims in his lawsuit against the UniCredit parent
company as well as London-based  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   The July 28 order was amended, Rakoff wrote, to “include a
dismissal of the trustee’s common law claims against Bank
Austria.”  Picard in December filed a revised complaint in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court against HSBC, accusing it of aiding Madoff’s
fraud. The complaint seeks to recover $2 billion in transfers
out of Madoff’s business. It also asserted common-law claims
seeking at least $6.6 billion from HSBC and about $2 billion
from a group of 36 other defendants, including Milan-based
UniCredit, according to Rakoff’s ruling.  Rakoff took the case out of  bankruptcy court  and considered
whether Picard could bring common-law claims, such as aiding and
abetting Madoff’s fraud. The judge said July 28 that all the
common-law claims must be dismissed, with the remainder of the
case returned to the bankruptcy court.  Picard didn’t immediately return a phone message seeking
comment today after regular business hours.  The case is Picard v. HSBC Bank Plc, 11-cv-0763, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
