A stock-market slump that dragged
 Taiwan  and South  Korea ’s benchmark indexes 20 percent below
their highs prompted state-run funds to buy equities and Korean
regulators to bolster scrutiny of trading activities. Benchmark
indexes narrowed earlier declines.  Taiwan's government bought equities yesterday and this 
morning through four funds it controls, Philip Yang, a Cabinet 
spokesman, said. Korea Teachers Pension, the nation’s second-
largest public pension fund, said it purchased about 70 billion 
won ($64 million) of stocks during the recent selloff. South 
Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service said it will monitor short
selling and whether brokerages are following trading rules.  “The big concern here is wealth destruction, that is
investors capitulate and sell, triggering a snowball effect,”
said  Gavin Parry , managing director of Parry International
Trading Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “If this continues, governments in
the region will most probably step in.”  Taiwan’s Taiex Index completed its biggest six-day drop
since September 2001 today, while the Kospi Index was headed for
its largest six-day slump since October 2008 in Seoul. Stocks
worldwide have tumbled this week after  Standard & Poor’s 
reduction of the U.S.’s debt rating fueled concern the global
economy will slow. Federal Reserve policy makers will hold a
one-day meeting today as the downgrade fueled speculation
America is headed for a recession.  Bear Market  “Once investors opt to reduce their emerging-market
assets, countries such as Korea could be the first market they
would consider divesting because it has many large-cap stocks
and has relatively more liquidity,” said Chung Yun Sik, chief
investment officer for equities at ING Investment Management
Korea Ltd., which oversees about $16 billion.  The Taiex closed 0.8 percent lower at 7,493.12, after
dropping 5.4 percent. The index is down 18 percent from a Jan.
28 high, having fallen as much as 22 percent. A decline of 20
percent or more signals a  bear market  to some investors.  The Taiex has tumbled 14 percent in the past six days,
while the Kospi has lost 17 percent. The South Korean gauge has
plunged 19 percent from its May 2 record, having lost as much as
24 percent. It slumped 3.2 percent to 1,810.51 as of 2:48 p.m.
in Seoul, having tumbled 9.9 percent earlier.  “We have taken actions yesterday and this morning,”
Taiwan’s Yang said by phone from Taipei today. The four funds
controlled by the government are the labor insurance fund, labor
pension fund, civil-servant pension fund and postal fund.  ‘Largest Hit’  Yang declined to comment whether the government bought
equities using the NT$500 billion ($17.2 billion) National
Stabilization Fund, which was created in March 2000 to support
markets when threatened by non-economic factors.  Taiwan will be “suffering the largest hit” from a U.S.
and Euro-zone demand shock, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a
July 28 report. Citigroup Inc. cut the year-end target for the
Taiex to 8,770 from 10,000 based on the “de-rating” the market
is undergoing,  Peter Kurz , an analyst at the brokerage, said in
a report today.  South Korea ’s Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan asked other
ministers in a meeting today to bolster the market monitoring
system, the ministry said in a statement today. The government
should try to restore market confidence, Bahk said.  The Financial Supervisory Service asked pension funds,
brokerages and asset-management companies to step up efforts to
stabilize the market, according to an e-mailed statement today.  Korea Teachers  Korea Teachers Pension, which manages about 9.5 trillion
won, plans to buy more stocks if prices fall further, Chief
Investment Officer Lee Yun Kyu said by phone today.  Korea
Teachers  has room to invest 300 billion won for the rest of the
year, he said.  “I think we’re now at a bottom,” Lee said. “It was
really a broad-based sell-off so that we plan to add evenly
across sectors.”  Program trading on Kospi shares was stopped for five
minutes today and yesterday after  Kospi 200 Index (KOSPI2)  futures fell
more than 5 percent for more than a minute,  Korea Exchange  Inc.
said. Trading of shares on the Kosdaq Index, which has more than
1,000 stocks, was also halted today and yesterday after the
index tumbled in excess of 10 percent for more than a minute,
triggering automatic curbs.  The exchange operator will keep a close eye on short
selling and arbitrage transactions, Korea Exchange said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday before markets opened, after an
emergency meeting by Chairman Kim Bong Soo and other officials.  Investors typically use short sales to capitalize on an
expected decline in the security’s price. It is the practice of
selling a security that the seller does not own but is committed
to repurchase eventually.  To contact the reporters on this story:
