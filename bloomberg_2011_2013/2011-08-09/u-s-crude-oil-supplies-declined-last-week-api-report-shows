Crude oil inventories declined 5.21
million barrels to 348.6 million last week, the  American
Petroleum Institute  said today. Futures advanced in electronic
trading after the release.  Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, dropped 1.4
million barrels to 34.6 million.  Gasoline stockpiles fell 1.01 million barrels to 211.2
million, the report showed.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  The government report may show stockpiles of crude oil rose
1.35 million barrels over the period, according to the median of
12 responses in a Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline inventories
probably rose 900,000 barrels, the survey showed.  Oil-supply totals from the API and DOE have moved in the
same direction 71 percent of the time over the past year and 75
percent over the past four years.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for September delivery rose 55 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $81.86 a barrel at 4:32 p.m. in electronic trading
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract, which settled
at $79.30, traded at $81.30 before release of the report at 4:30
p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
