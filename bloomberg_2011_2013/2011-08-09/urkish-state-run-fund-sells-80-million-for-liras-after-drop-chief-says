Turkey ’s state-run employment fund
Iskur sold foreign currency for liras for the second day after
the lira extended a two-year low against the dollar, general
manager Kemal Bicerli said.  The transaction of $80 million followed a sale of $85
million yesterday, Bicerli said in a telephone interview from
Ankara. Iskur may sell more foreign exchange “in the coming
days” depending on market opportunities, he said.  Turkey has taken measures to arrest a slide in the lira,
which accelerated amid concern over the nation’s widening trade
deficit. The central bank cut the  interest rates  it offers on
deposits in euros and dollars today, and started selling dollars
in daily auctions on Aug. 5.  The lira fell 0.2 percent to 1.7844 per dollar at 11:27
a.m., declining for the fourth day and reversing gains made
before Iskur said it sold the foreign exchange.  The sales are not expected to stop the lira’s decline
because of “existing market conditions,” broker Garanti
Securities said in an e-mailed report to investors today.  Iskur, which collects premiums from employees to pay
jobless benefits, had 49.4 billion liras ($27.7 billion) under
management as of June 30, according to its website. Iskur keeps
70 percent of its portfolio in fixed-coupon bonds and 2.4
percent in foreign exchange accounts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
