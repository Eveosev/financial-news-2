Chile’s peso fell for a fourth day on
concern the U.S. and European debt crises will slow global
growth, reducing demand for riskier emerging-market assets.  The peso declined 0.1 percent to 472.97 per  U.S. dollar  at
1:29 p.m. New York time from 472.52 yesterday, after sliding as
much as 0.6 percent earlier in the day. European and U.S. stocks
rebounded from yesterday’s rout on speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will act to restore confidence in the markets.  “The market’s aversion to risk is still quite high,”
Alejandro Araya,  executive director  for FX market making at
Banco Santander Chile, said by telephone from Santiago.
“Investors are taking more defensive positions because they
don’t know how far the crises in the U.S. and  Europe  will reach.
Stock markets are up for the day, but only because they lost
between 15 and 20 percent during the last few weeks.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rebounded 1.7 percent after
falling 6.7 percent yesterday, its biggest decline since
December 2008. S&P cut the U.S. credit rating to AA+ from AAA on
Aug. 5, the nation’s first downgrade. The index has tumbled 15
percent since July 22. The Stoxx 600 advanced 1.4 percent at the
close in  London . The measure dropped 4.1 percent yesterday.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.08 percent. It has declined for nine
straight sessions, the longest losing streak since November
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
