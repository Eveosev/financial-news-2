     Aug. 9 (Bloomberg) --Treasuries rose, pushing 10 and two-
year note yields to a all-time lows, after Federal Reserve
officials promised to keep benchmark  interest rates  at record
lows through mid-2013 in a bid to revive economic growth.  U.S. debt  rallied as central bank policy makers said
economic growth is “considerably slower.” The Treasury’s sale
of $32 billion in three-year notes drew stronger-than-average
demand in the first note sale since  Standard & Poor’s  cut the
U.S. debt rating Aug. 5.  “It’s pretty amazing that the Fed will be exceptionally
low until 2013,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government
trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage
for institutional investors. “They are telling you that we are
in a stage of Japanese-like growth. The front end is rallying
like crazy.”  Yields on 10-year notes fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 2.24 percent at 5 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.125 percent
securities maturing in May 2021 rose 20/32, or $6.25 per $1,000
face amount, to 107 20/32. The yield touched 2.0346 percent,
lower than the previous record of 2.0352 percent in December
2008.  Note and bond yields plunged after the Fed’s statement was
issued at 2:18 p.m., New York time, before paring the declines
later during the afternoon.  Two-year note yields fell six basis points to 0.20 percent.
The yield touched 0.1568 percent, lower than the previous record
of 0.2283 percent yesterday. Thirty-year bond yields fell one
basis point to 3.646 percent.  The yield curve, or the difference between two- and 10-year
Treasury note yields, narrowed to 2.06 percentage points, the
lowest since Oct. 11, 2010.  ‘Weakened Outlook’  “The market wanted the Fed to acknowledge the weakened
outlook, and they did,” said  Priya Misra , head of U.S. rates
strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York, one of
the 20 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “The explicit
commitment to mid-2013 by the Fed has reaffirmed price action.”  Yields on 10-year notes have declined as much as 78 basis
points since July 26 as economic indicators signal more slowing
of the  U.S. economy  and President  Barack Obama  and Republicans
in Congress engaged in a protracted struggle to address federal
budget deficits and boost the debt limit, following the S&P
ratings cut.  Manufacturing in the U.S. almost stalled in July,
threatening to deprive the two-year recovery of one of its main
drivers. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index
slumped to 50.9, the lowest since July 2009, from 55.3 a month
earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said Aug. 1.  The worldwide retreat from stocks and commodities has
driven the value of the global  bond market  to a record high.  Bond Value  The market value of Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Global
Broad Market Index has increased $132.4 billion since the end of
July to $42.1 trillion, the most in data going back to 1996. The
index, containing more than 19,000 bonds sold by governments,
banks and the world’s biggest companies, returned 1.09 percent
this month as yesterday’s stock rout wiped out about $2.5
trillion in global equity values, extending total losses since
July 26 to $7.8 trillion.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  discussed a range of
policy tools to bolster the economy and said it’s “prepared to
employ these tools as appropriate,” it said in a statement
today in  Washington .  “When you look at the economy,  Europe  and the uncertainty
in the markets it was clear that the Fed needed to do something,
and they did,” said  Scott Graham , head of government bond
trading at Bank of Montreal’s BMO Capital Markets unit in
 Chicago . “Quantitative easing may be in the cards at some point
soon.”  3-Year Sale  The three-year note auction drew a yield of 0.50 percent,
the lowest yield since records began in May 1981. It was less
than the 0.523 percent average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of seven of the Fed’s primary dealers.  The bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand was 3.29,
compared with an average of 3.15 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 47.9 percent of the notes, the most
since May 2010, compared with an average of 33.9 percent for the
past 10 sales. Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that
place their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 11.1
percent of the notes at the sale, compared with an average of
13.2 percent for the past 10 auctions.  At the July sale, the securities drew a yield of 0.67
percent.  Debt Sales  The offering is the first of three note and bond auctions
this week totaling $72 billion. The Treasury is scheduled to
sell $24 billion in 10-year debt tomorrow and $16 billion of 30
year bonds on Aug. 11.  Treasuries surged yesterday as tumbling stock markets
sparked demand for the safety of government debt. S&P cut the
U.S. government’s AAA credit rating at the end of last week,
while Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings have affirmed
the U.S. at the top rating.  Volatility in the Treasury market has picked up. Merrill
Lynch & Co.’s MOVE index, which measure price swings in
Treasuries based on prices of over-the-counter options maturing
in two to 30 years, rose yesterday to 117.8, the highest since
Dec. 17, up from a 2011 low of 71.5 in May.  Treasuries have returned 6.2 percent this year, according
to indexes complied by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies.  Japan ’s government bonds have
gained 1.3 percent, while German bunds have returned 4.8
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
