European stocks climbed from a two-
year low, snapping a seven-day slump in the benchmark Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  will act
to restore confidence in the markets.  Basic-resource stocks rebounded from an 11-day slide, led
by gains at  Antofagasta Plc. (ANTO)   Thomas Cook Group Plc (TCG) , Europe’s
second-largest tour operator, surged 17 percent.  RWE AG (RWE) ,
Germany’s second-biggest power company, led utilities lower
after profit fell.  The Stoxx 600 advanced 1.4 percent to 232.2 at the 4:30
p.m. close in  London , having earlier tumbled 5.1 percent. The
gauge has still plunged 20 percent from this year’s high in
February amid mounting speculation that Europe will fail to
contain its sovereign-debt crisis and concern that the U.S.
recovery is faltering.  The Fed will “hint that we’ll get help for the economy,”
James Bevan, London-based chief investment officer at CCLA
Investments, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “If
I look at the fundamental free cash flows that many companies
are giving, there is outstanding value.”  Fed policy makers are holding a one-day meeting today as
last week’s  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of the U.S. credit
rating fuels concern about the world’s largest economy.
Speculation has grown that the Fed will initiate a third round
of emergency stimulus measures, known as QE3, to prop up growth.
A report today showed China’s inflation accelerated to the
fastest pace in three years in July, limiting the scope for
monetary easing as risks to the global economy mount.  ‘Double-Dip Risk’  “We see equity markets pricing in double-dip risk until
just before the Fed moves with its possible QE3 policy response
in the week of Aug. 26,”  Todd Martin , a Hong Kong-based equity
strategist at Societe Generale SA, wrote in a report.  The Stoxx 600 has rallied 44 percent since March 2009 when
governments and central banks around the world enacted emergency
stimulus measures to boost the economy. The valuation of the
Stoxx 600 fell to 9.3 times its companies’ forecast earnings
yesterday, below the 12.2 times average multiple during the past
five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was
the cheapest since the  bull market  began in March 2009.  National benchmark indexes rose in 13 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 1.9 percent and
France’s CAC 40 increased 1.6 percent. Germany’s DAX Index
slipped 0.1 percent.  ‘Pretty Battered’  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of protecting
against a decline in shares on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, gained
2.4 percent to 46.4, its highest level since May 2010. The
options gauge has advanced for 10 days in a row, the longest
stretch of gains on record.  “Sentiment is already pretty battered,” George Godber,
who manages 150 million pounds ($245 million) at Matterley LLP,
said in a Bloomberg Television interview in London. “The fears
of the U.S. going into recession have now passed and we’ve
priced in a double dip.”  Antofagasta, the copper producer controlled by Chile’s
Luksic family, rose 6.1 percent to 1,205 pence, ending seven
days of losses.  Xstrata Plc (XTA) , the largest exporter of power-
station coal, added 7.4 percent to 1,042 pence. Rio Tinto Group,
the second-biggest mining company, increased 4.7 percent to
3,548 pence. A gauge of basic-resource shares in the Stoxx 600
gained 3 percent, the most since December.  Thomas Cook   Thomas Cook surged 17 percent to 53.35 pence, rebounding
from yesterday’s 16 percent drop.  Meyer Burger Technology AG (MBTN) ,
the biggest producer of solar-panel manufacturing equipment,
jumped 15 percent to 26.85 Swiss francs, snapping an 11-day
losing streak in which the stock slid 30 percent.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  led gains in the Euro Stoxx 50
Index, advancing 6.3 percent to 58.63 euros.  RWE tumbled 6.3 percent to 28.75 euros, the lowest since
2003. The company said first-half profit dropped after cutting
full-year earnings targets yesterday because of the costs of
phasing out nuclear power stations. Larger rival EON AG lost 5.9
percent to 15.53 euros.  Yara International ASA (YAR) , the world’s biggest publicly traded
nitrogen-fertilizer maker, slumped 3.7 percent to 243.40 kroner
as BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research downgraded the shares to
“underperform” from “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
