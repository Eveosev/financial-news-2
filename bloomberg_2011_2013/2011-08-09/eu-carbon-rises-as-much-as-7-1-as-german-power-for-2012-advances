European Union carbon permits
increased to their highest level since Aug. 3, as European
equities advanced for the first time in 12 days.  Carbon for December climbed 6.3 percent to close at 11.42
euros ($16.27) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in London. They rose as high as 11.50 euros around midday when
4.6 million tons were traded in an hour. Total volume was 21.7
million tons, the most since Aug. 3.  Carbon prices sometimes track equities because both are
linked to economic activity. The STOXX Europe 600 index rose 1.4
percent after being down 5.1 percent earlier today at the lowest
level since July 2009. The carbon contract fell as low as 10.25
euros a ton yesterday, the weakest since February 2009, amid
concerns about the economic growth outlook and European debt
crisis.  German power for next year gained 0.7 percent to 56.60
euros a megawatt hour, while  Brent crude  rose 0.7 percent after
giving up earlier losses.  ICE said earlier today that open interest for December
carbon permits fell 3.1 percent yesterday to 155 million tons,
potentially signaling that traders had closed bets that prices
would fall further.  Open interest in the front-year contract had risen as high
as 162.5 million tons on July 26. Open interest in the December
2012 futures climbed to a record of 260 million tons yesterday
from 259.7 million tons a day earlier.  “The drop in open interest for the EU allowances for
December yesterday might indicate a trend reversal,” said
Clemens Tummeltshammer, an analyst for Bloomberg New Energy
Finance in London. “While some of the contracts will have been
rolled forward to later maturities, the aggregate open interest
still decreased. Thus speculative traders will have covered some
of their short position built up during the previous bearish
weeks to lock in their profits.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
