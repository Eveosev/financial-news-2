Bangchak Petroleum Pcl (BCP) , a Thai state-
owned refiner, plans to spend 12 billion baht ($401 million) to
expand solar power projects, President Anusorn Sangnimnaun said.  The expansion will help boost earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization to 2.2 billion baht after
the three projects start operating, from an estimated 115
million baht this year, Anusorn said.  The first plant, with a capacity of 38 megawatts, started
supplying electricity to the national grid on Aug. 5.
Construction of the second plant, with a planned capacity of 32
megawatts, will start around the end of the year, he said.  The third project, with a capacity of 48 megawatts, will be
built next year. The projects take about 15 months to complete,
Anusorn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
