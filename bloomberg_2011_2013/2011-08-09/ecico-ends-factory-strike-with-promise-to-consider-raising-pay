Lecico Egypt , a producer of tiles and
sanitary ware, ended a strike at one of its factories by
promising workers that it would consider raising their pay,
Deputy Chief Executive Officer Taher Gargour said.  The company’s Alexandria plant, which employs 3,000
workers, shut down for nine-days after as many as 300 staff
refused to work, Gargour said in a telephone interview
yesterday. Production at the plant, responsible for 74 percent
of the company’s tile output and 30 percent of sanitary ware,
resumed on Aug. 4.  “We said we would consider the amount they asked for as we
also received a request from the Ministry of Manpower,” Gargour
said. “We expect to arrive at a decision in the coming few
weeks, and I suspect it will be a positive one.”  The increase demanded by workers is in the “low single”
percentage points relative to current pay, he said. If approved,
the raise would apply to all 6,000 Lecico workers, he said.
Lecico increased its wage bill by 27 percent in February to meet
demands by workers and paid an annual raise last month.  Lecico’s first-quarter profit fell by more than half from a
year-earlier earlier to 12.5 million Egyptian pounds ($2.1
million), the company said in May. Second-quarter results are
due on Aug. 15, Gargour said.  Lecico shares retreated 6.3 percent to 8.46 pounds at the
1:30 p.m. close on the Egyptian Exchange, the lowest level since
January 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
