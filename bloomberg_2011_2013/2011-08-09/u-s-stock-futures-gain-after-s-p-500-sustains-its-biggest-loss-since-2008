U.S. stock futures advanced as
investors awaited the outcome of a Federal Reserve meeting after
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index posted its biggest loss since
2008.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  climbed 2.8 percent in early  New York  trading,
while  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  rallied 2.2 percent.  American Express Co. (AXP) 
declined in  Europe .  Contracts on the  S&P 500  expiring in September added 1.8
percent to 1,131 at 7:20 a.m. in New York after earlier rising
as much as 3.3 percent and falling as much as 3.2 percent. Dow
Jones Industrial Average futures gained 163 points to 10,889.  U.S. stocks tumbled yesterday amid concern that S&P’s
downgrade of the nation’s credit rating will worsen the
country’s economic slowdown. Every stock in the S&P 500
retreated for the first time since at least 1996 as the index’s
10 main groups all tumbled more than 5.3 percent.  “Right now it’s a question of confidence,” said  Jonathan Golub , the chief U.S. market strategist at UBS AG, in a
Bloomberg Radio interview in New York. “There is no liquidity
shock here, there’s no economic news. This is a confidence game
and once we get beyond this and look back at the economics, the
market is going to move higher.”  Fed policy makers meet today and plan to issue a statement
at about 2:15 p.m. New York time. By a 52 percent to 48 percent
margin, respondents in a Bloomberg News survey said the central
bank would ease policy this year through monetary tools or
statement language. If the Federal Open Market Committee acts,
59 percent said it would communicate that the federal funds
rate, balance sheet or both will remain especially stimulative
for a longer period or more specific amount of time.  VIX Surges  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, advanced yesterday to its highest level since
March 2009.  Economic data today showed  China ’s inflation accelerated to
the fastest pace in three years in July, limiting the scope for
monetary easing as risks to the global economy mount.  S&P lowered the U.S.’s long-term rating one level to AA+
after markets closed on Aug. 5, while keeping the outlook at
“negative” as the company becomes less confident that Congress
will end Bush-era tax cuts or tackle entitlements. S&P also said
the U.S. rating may be reduced to AA within two years if
spending reductions are lower than agreed to,  interest rates 
rise or “new fiscal pressures” result in higher general
government debt.  Price-Earnings Ratios  The S&P 500 is valued at 11.3 times estimated income, the
lowest since March 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price-earnings ratio reached a low of 9.52 in
2008. The S&P 500 has dropped 18 percent since April 29. The
 Russell 2000 Index (RTY)  of small companies slumped 8.9 percent
yesterday, entering a so-called bear market, down 25 percent
from its April 29 high.  Alcoa advanced 2.8 percent to $11.65 in New York, while
Home Depot increased 2.2 percent to $29.58. AmEx, the biggest
credit-card issuer by purchases, slipped 2.3 percent to $42.04
in  Germany .  To contact the reporters on this story:
