Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s cancer drug
Herceptin poses a bigger risk of heart problems for elderly
patients than for the younger women usually recruited in
clinical trials, researchers said in a study published
today in the journal Annals of Oncology.  The study reviewed records for 45 women between the ages of
70 and 92, and it’s the first to assess the Roche drug’s heart
risks specifically for elderly patients, researchers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
