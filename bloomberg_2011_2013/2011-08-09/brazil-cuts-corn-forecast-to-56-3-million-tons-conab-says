Corn growers in  Brazil , the world’s
third-biggest producer, will harvest less grain this year than
previously forecast after frost damaged winter crops, according
to the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture.  The harvest will be 56.3 million metric tons, down from a
July 6 estimate of 57.1 million tons, the Ministry’s Conab crop-
forecasting agency said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Crops in Parana, Mato Grosso do Sul and Sao Paulo states
were hit by frost during a critical stage of development,”
Conab said. Freezing temperatures occurred late June in areas
where the winter crop is grown. Winter corn, which accounts for
38 percent of domestic output, is planted between January and
March and harvested from July to September.  Soybean farmers in Brazil, the world’s second-largest
producer after the U.S., harvested 75.3 million metric tons of
the oilseed this year, from 75 million tons in a previous
forecast, Conab said. The soybean harvest ended in June.  Brazil produced 56 million tons of corn and 68.7 million
tons of soybeans last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
