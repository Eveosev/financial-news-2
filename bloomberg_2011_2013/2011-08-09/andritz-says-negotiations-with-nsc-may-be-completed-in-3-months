Andritz AG (ANDR)  Chief Executive Officer
Wolfgang Leitner said negotiations with  NSC Groupe (NSGP)  to acquire
its NSC Nonwovens unit may be completed withing three months.  The unit would become part of Andritz pulp and paper
business should it be acquired, Leitner told reporters in Vienna
today, declining to provide further detail.  NSC announced on Aug. 5 that it was in exclusive talks with
the world’s second-biggest builder of hydropower plants to sell
the unit, which consists of the companies Asselin-Thibeau, based
in Elbeuf, France, and Wuxi NSC, based in China, and makes
equipment used in the production of non-woven fabrics. In 2010
NSC Nonwovens was responsible for 41 percent of its parent’s

website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
