Hungary opposes  Gabriel Resources
Ltd. (GBU) ’s stalled Rosia Montana gold-mine project, which aims to
use cyanide to extract the ore, Mediafax reported today, citing
Romanian Environment Minister Laszlo Borbely.  Romania  asked neighboring Hungary in February this year to
make a non-binding recommendation on the project, as Romania is
carrying out an environmental-impact assessment on the mine, the
Bucharest-based news service said, citing Borbely. Hungarian
opposition to the project won’t stop Romania carrying out the
assessment, Borbely was quoted by  Mediafax as saying .  To contact the reporter on this story:
