The Norwegian krone weakened against
the euro amid speculation that the Norges Bank will keep its
benchmark rate unchanged tomorrow.  The krone declined versus 13 of 16 major peers tracked by
Bloomberg as investors speculated that the euro area’s fiscal
crisis could prompt policy makers to delay a planned interest
rate increase. Central bankers in the second-largest Nordic
economy left the overnight deposit rate unchanged at 2.25
percent in June and signaled they would tighten monetary policy
in August.  “Due to financial jitters they could decide to keep rates
unchanged,” said Arne Lohman Rasmussen of Danske Bank A/S.
“There was a consensus that they’d hike rates, but due to
recent events in financial markets this is a very uncertain call
now.”  Norway’s krone fell 0.9 percent against the euro to 7.8395
as of 3:30 p.m. in  London . It weakened 0.3 percent to 5.4942 per
dollar.  To contact the writer on the story:
