Japanese and Australian stock
futures rose after the Federal Reserve pledged to keep its
benchmark  interest rate  at a record low at least through mid-
2013 to revive the world’s biggest economy, boosting the outlook
for Asian exporters.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest camera maker by market capitalization, gained 2 percent
from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s No. 2 publicly traded bank, rose
1.7 percent. ADRs of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the largest global
carmaker by market value, climbed 1.5 percent. Those of  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, jumped 3 percent
even after crude prices fell.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,110 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,000 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,100
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index gained 2.9 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index,
the first market to open in the Asia-Pacific region, leapt 3.8
percent in Wellington, set for the biggest gain since October
2008.  “The Fed’s plans for monetary easing and its pledge to use
additional measures to avoid a double-dip recession are
commendable,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in  Tokyo 
at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.  U.S. Rebound  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.5
percent today. In  New York  yesterday, the  S&P 500  rallied 4.7
percent, the biggest advance since March 2009 after the Fed
pledged for the first time to keep its benchmark lending rate at
a record low at least through mid-2013 to revive a recovery it
described as “considerably slower” than anticipated.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  is “prepared to employ”
additional tools to bolster an economy hobbled by weak hiring
and anemic household spending, it said in a statement. Three
members of the FOMC dissented, preferring to maintain the pledge
to keep rates low for an “extended period.”  The Fed meeting came after a global stock rout sparked by
 Standard & Poor’s  decision to cut the U.S. government’s credit-
rating on Aug. 5 by one level to AA+ in response to the deal
that President Barack Obama and lawmakers reached to raise the
federal $14.3 trillion debt limit.  Dollar Falls  The dollar declined versus the majority of its most-traded
peers. The U.S. currency depreciated to as low as 76.71 yen
today in Tokyo, compared with 77.37 at the close of stock
trading yesterday, cutting the value of some overseas income at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  Copper futures for September delivery climbed 0.2 percent
in New York, rebounding from an eight-month low.  Still, crude oil for September delivery tumbled 2.5 percent
to $79.30 in New York yesterday, the lowest level since
September after the  Federal Reserve  said risks to the economy
have increased and didn’t announce asset purchases. Prices
rebounded in electronic trading after the settlement.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 13 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with drops of 6.8 percent by the S&P
500 and 16 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 12.1 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 11.8 times for the S&P 500 and 9.5 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
