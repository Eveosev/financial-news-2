Crude oil options volatility rose for
a second day as the underlying futures fell to a 10-month low
after the  Federal Reserve  said risks to the economy have
increased.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 69.1 percent at 4 p.m. in New York,
up from 61.5 percent yesterday.  Oil for September delivery dropped $2.01, or 2.5 percent,
to $79.30 a barrel, the lowest settlement since Sept. 29 on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures have fallen 8.7 percent in
the past two days and 13 percent this year.  Options volatility has more than doubled since Aug. 3, when
it was 31.73 percent.  Bets that prices will fall accounted for the five most-
active options in electronic trading today. The most active
contracts were September $70 puts, with 8,300 lots changing
hands as of 4:45 p.m. They lost 8 cents to 38 cents a barrel.
September $75 puts, the next-most active option, dropped 15
cents to $1.05 with 4,753 lots trading. One contract covers
1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occur the next business day.  September $80 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 8,154 lots changing hands. They advanced $1.95
to $2.60 a barrel. The next-most active options, November $75

44,871 contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 44,454 and
