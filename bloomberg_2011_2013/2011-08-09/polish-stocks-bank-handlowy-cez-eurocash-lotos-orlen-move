Poland ’s WIG20 Index sank 76.53, or
3.2 percent, to 2,313.48 in Warsaw, sliding for a seventh day
and posting the longest losing streak since January 2009.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Bank Handlowy SA (BHW PW) lost 6.2 zloty, or 8.2 percent,
to 69 zloty, closing at the lowest level in more than a year,
after the Citigroup Inc. unit reported earnings that missed
analysts’ estimates. First-half net income fell to 332.6 million
zloty from 349.4 million zloty a year earlier. That compares
with the 368.4 million-zloty average estimate of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the largest Czech power producer, fell for
a second day, retreating by 6.9 zloty, or 5.1 percent, to 128.1
zloty. CEZ shares will be removed from the WIG20 after the close
of trading on Sept. 16, the Warsaw bourse said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday.  Eurocash SA (EUR)  , Poland’s largest distributor of non-
durable  consumer goods , slumped as much as 23 percent to 18.53
zloty and was 4.1 percent lower at 23 zloty.  Emperia Holding SA (EMP) ,
a Polish food distribution and retail network, withdrew from an
agreement to sell its units and  demanded  200 million zloty
($69.8 million) in compensation after Eurocash failed to
complete the deal on time. Eurocash said there are “no
grounds” for the claim and it’s continuing to carry out the
acquisition agreement.  Emperia (EMP PW) shares sank 12.1 zloty, or 12 percent, to
86 zloty, the steepest daily decline in three years.  Getin Holding SA (GTN)  , the financial-services group
controlled by Polish billionaire Leszek Czarnecki, slid 0.3
zloty, or 3.4 percent, to 8.5 zloty, closing at the lowest level
since December 2009.  Bank BPH SA (BPH)  , a unit of General
Electric Co., tumbled 2.6 zloty, or 5.6 percent, to 43.5 zloty.
Getin and BPH are among lenders whose earnings are most
vulnerable if a further decline in the zloty worsens the quality
of Swiss franc-denominated home loan portfolios, ING Groep NV
said.  The zloty was 2.6 percent weaker against the Swiss currency
at 3.9008 after slumping 3 percent to a record low of 3.9225 to
the franc earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
