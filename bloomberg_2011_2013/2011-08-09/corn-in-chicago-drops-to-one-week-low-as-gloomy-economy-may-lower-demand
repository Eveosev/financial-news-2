Corn fell to a one-week low in
 Chicago  on concern the loss of the U.S.’s AAA credit rating will
sap a weakening recovery and erode demand. Soybeans reached the
lowest price in almost five months.  The S&P GSCI Spot Index of raw materials retreated to the
lowest level since December. The MSCI World Index of shares
dropped for a 10th day and oil sank below $80 a barrel in  New
York .  “It’s definitely the broader economic weakness we’re
seeing” weighing on the market, Erin FitzPatrick, an analyst at
Rabobank International in London, said by phone. “Any of the
underlying fundamentals are being overshadowed by the broader
market.”  Corn for December delivery slid 10.75 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $6.7525 a bushel by 11:25 a.m.  London  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Prices reached $6.6875, the lowest level
since Aug. 1. Soybeans for November delivery fell 11 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $13.005 a bushel after touching $12.82, the
lowest price since March 16.  “It’s all about the gloomy economy driving stocks and
commodities lower,” said  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , general manager of
research at IDO Securities Co. Still, the U.S. corn crop’s poor
condition following a heat wave in the Midwest gave some support
to the market, he said.  About 60 percent of corn in the top 18 producing states was
in good or excellent condition as of Aug. 7, down from 62
percent a week earlier and 71 percent a year ago, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said yesterday in a  report . About 93
percent of the plants were reproducing, up from 83 percent the
previous week, the USDA said.  Crop Conditions  “In the case of corn, we did see that conditions in the
U.S. continue to deteriorate,” Rabobank’s FitzPatrick said.
“Weather needs to improve in the U.S. Fundamentals still remain
fairly tight.”  An estimated 61 percent of the soybean crop got the top
ratings, compared with 60 percent a week ago and 66 percent a
year earlier. About 87 percent of the plants were flowering, up
from 77 percent the previous week, the USDA said.  About 96 percent of spring wheat, grown mostly in the
northern Great Plains, was forming grain, compared with 90
percent a week earlier and 100 percent on average in the past
five years, the USDA said. An estimated 66 percent of the crop
was in good or excellent condition, compared with 70 percent a
week earlier and 82 percent a year earlier.  The winter-wheat harvest was 85 percent completed, compared
with 81 percent a week earlier, the USDA said. The average for
the previous five years was 91 percent.  Wheat for December delivery slid 7.25 cents, or 1 percent,
to $6.875 a bushel after reaching $6.8175, the lowest price
since July 26. Milling wheat for November delivery traded on
NYSE Liffe in Paris fell 2.75 euros, or 1.4 percent, to 187.50
euros ($267.54) a metric ton.  To contact the reporters on this story：
