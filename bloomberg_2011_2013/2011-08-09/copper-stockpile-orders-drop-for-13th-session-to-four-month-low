Orders to remove copper from
stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange dropped for a
13th session to a four-month low. Orders for aluminum, lead and
zinc also declined.  Copper orders, known as canceled warrants, fell 1,275
metric tons, or 11 percent, to 10,125 tons on declines in  New
Orleans  and Gwangyang in  South Korea , daily LME figures showed.
That was the lowest level since April 8.  Aluminum canceled warrants dropped for an 11th session,
falling 3 percent to 320,525 tons on drops in South Korea and
the U.S. Lead canceled warrants dropped 6.2 percent to 9,900
tons, the lowest level since June 17, and zinc orders declined
1.9 percent to 108,925 tons after last week reaching the highest
level since April 2006.  “The recent downtrend in canceled warrants is probably a
combination of the typical summer lull and consumers in wait-
and-see mode,” said Sven Streitmayer, an analyst at Landesbank
Baden-Wuerttemberg in Stuttgart,  Germany .  Orders to draw nickel and tin from stocks rose to the
highest levels since July 14 and July 20, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
