South Korean regulators will act
according to a “contingency plan” in times of financial crisis,
the Financial Services Commission said today in an e-mailed copy
of a report to parliament’s policy committee.  South Korean banks will undergo stress tests to determine
whether they are able to fund themselves for at least three
months, according to the report.  The regulator is closely monitoring stocks, bonds and
 currency markets  together with foreign investors’ capital flows
and will take “systematic” steps to counter market moves, the
FSC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
