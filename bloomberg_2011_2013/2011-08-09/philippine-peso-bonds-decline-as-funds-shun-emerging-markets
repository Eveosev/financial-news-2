The Philippine peso fell to the
lowest level in almost three weeks as debt woes in the U.S. and
 Europe  reduced the appeal of holding emerging-market assets.  The Southeast Asian nation will continue to buy and hold
U.S. assets as reserves even amid “greater attention and need”
to diversify, central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said in an
interview with Bloomberg TV today. The Philippine Stock Exchange
Index declined 4.5 percent, its biggest daily drop in more than
two years, while  government bonds  also fell.  “It’s risk-off as investors adjust their global positions
with what’s going on in the U.S. and Europe,” said Roland Avante, treasurer at Sterling Bank of Asia in Manila. “At the
end of the day, the dollar and Treasuries are still the most
liquid and the most widely traded.”  The peso weakened 0.4 percent to 42.665 per dollar as of
11:17 a.m. in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It
touched 42.770 earlier, the lowest since July 20.  The yield on the 9.125 percent bonds due September 2016
rose 12 points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 5 percent,
according to prices from Tradition Financial Services.  The Philippines may sell at least 35 billion pesos ($820
million) of debt targeted at individual investors next quarter,
Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola told reporters yesterday.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
