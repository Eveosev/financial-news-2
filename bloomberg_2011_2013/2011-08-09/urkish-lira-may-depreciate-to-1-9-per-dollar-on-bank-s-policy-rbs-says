The lira will probably decline to 1.9
per dollar by the end of the year, Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc said, citing concern about the central bank’s monetary
policy and the widening current account deficit.  RBS revised its year-end estimate for the lira from 1.75 to
1.8 per dollar, Tim Ash, global head of emerging market research
in  London , said in an e-mailed report to clients today.  “Now the over-riding comment from investors seems to be
that  Turkey  is just a short,” he said. “Foreign investors
currently appear to have little understanding or faith in the
monetary policy mix at present, while there is evidence that the
weak global backdrop is beginning to turn the domestic investor
base much more negative.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
