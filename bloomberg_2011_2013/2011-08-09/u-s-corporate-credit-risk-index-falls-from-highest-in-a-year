A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
fell from the highest level in more than a year on expectations
that Federal Reserve officials may strengthen a commitment to
monetary stimulus when they meet today.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
dropped 3.7 basis points to a mid-price of 111.4 basis points as
of 8:32 a.m. in  New York .  In a Bloomberg News survey, 52 percent of respondents said
they expected the Fed to use monetary policy or statement
language to calm markets agitated by  Standard & Poorâ€™s  downgrade
of the U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA+ on Aug. 5. The  S&P 500 
tumbled 6.7 percent yesterday, the most since December 2008.  The index of default swaps, which typically rises when
investor confidence deteriorates, climbed 12.1 basis points
yesterday to reach 115.1 points, the highest level since July 7,
2010.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meets its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.
A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting
$10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
