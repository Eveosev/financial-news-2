The  European Central Bank  bought
Italian and Spanish government bonds for a second day, according
to three people with knowledge of the transactions, who declined
to be identified because the trades are confidential.  The purchases helped push the 10-year Spanish bond yield
below 5 percent for the first time since December. A spokesman
for the central bank declined to comment.  The yield on Italian 10-year bonds slid 18 basis points to
5.1 percent at 9:55 a.m. in London after falling by 81 basis
points yesterday, the biggest one-day drop since the euro was
introduced in 1999.  Ten-year Spanish yields fell to 4.98 percent. Thatâ€™s the
first time it has dropped below 5 percent since Dec. 3.  Spanish bonds handed investors a 4.95 percent gain this
month compared with a 3.12 percent gain from Italian debt,
according to indexes compiled by the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. German bonds
returned 1.9 percent during the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
