About 4,000 employees of the U.S.
 Federal Aviation Administration  would get back pay for the two
weeks they were furloughed under a House bill introduced today.  The measure is sponsored by House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica, a Florida
Republican, and Frank LoBiondo, a New Jersey Republican, said
Jason Galanes, a spokesman for LoBiondo.  The furloughs began July 23 after the  House of
Representatives  and the Senate failed to agree on legislation to
renew the agency’s authority before it expired on July 22.
During the period, the agency estimated it was unable to collect
$28.6 million a day in aviation-tax revenue.  Congress passed a measure Aug. 5 to continue all FAA
programs through Sept. 16. Those include the distribution of
airport improvement project grants, which was halted during the
furloughs, and the agency’s revenue-raising authority.  The FAA has been operating under a series of short-term
extensions since its last multiyear funding bill ran out in
2007. Congress resumes voting on Sept. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
