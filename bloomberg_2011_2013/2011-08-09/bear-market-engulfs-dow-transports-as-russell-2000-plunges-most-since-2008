Declines in smaller companies and
transportation stocks yesterday brought losses since their 2011
peaks to more than 20 percent, signs that investors anticipate
another U.S. recession.  The  Russell 2000 Index (RTY)  plunged 8.9 percent yesterday, the
biggest drop since December 2008, bringing its decrease since
April 29 to 25 percent. The losses were led yesterday by  MGIC
Investment Corp. (MTG)  and  General Maritime Corp. (GMR) , which slid more
than 39 percent. The Dow Jones Transportation Average slipped 7
percent, marking a 22 percent retreat from its high on July 7,
as Con-Way Inc. and  Ryder System Inc. (R)  slumped 12 percent.  Analysts say the declines may foreshadow a contraction
because trains, truckers, airlines and smaller companies are
considered barometers for the economy. Dow Theory, developed by
Wall Street Journal co-founder Charles Dow in the 1800s, says
transportation companies lose business before gross domestic
product slows. Small-caps depend on the U.S. for more sales than
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies and have fallen prior to
recessions in the past.  “This is another indicator that the economy is slowing,”
Walter “Bucky” Hellwig, who helps manage $17 billion at BB&T
Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said in a telephone
interview yesterday. “If there’s an economic slowdown, that
means pressure on earnings estimates going forward, so the other
sectors follow suit and the market will likely fall further.”  Bear Market  The Dow transportation average lost 20 percent from its
2007 high in July through its low in November that year, the
common definition of a bear market. The U.S. entered a recession
the next month that lasted until June 2009, according to the
National Bureau of Economic Research.  The  Russell 2000  declined 13 percent in the same period and
slumped 7.3 percent in November 2007, at the time the worst
monthly performance since September 2002, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The S&P 500 reached its record high on Oct. 9,
2007, and didn’t enter a bear market until 2008, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  The Dow transportation average climbed 4.5 percent to
4,561.13 at 4 p.m. today in New York, bringing its loss since
July 7 to 19 percent. The Russell 2000 added 6.9 percent to
696.16 today. The S&P 500 rose 4.7 percent to 1,172.53, curbing
its losses since July 22, on speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will act today to restore confidence in markets.  U.S. Revenue  Russell 2000 stocks, which have an average market value of
$610 million according to Bloomberg data, rely on the U.S. for
about 80 percent of their revenue. That compares with 67 percent
of sales for members of the  S&P 500 , according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch. Shares in the larger-company gauge have a
mean market cap of $21.7 billion.  Stocks around the world have been tumbling, with the MSCI
All-Country World Index down 16 percent from July 22 through
yesterday. Europe entered a bear market yesterday when the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index slid 21 percent from the high in February.
Brazil’s benchmark equity index has tumbled 32 percent since
Jan. 12, its 2011 peak.  S&P lowered the U.S. long-term rating one level to AA+,
from AAA, after markets closed on Aug. 5, citing less confidence
that President Barack Obama will compromise with Congress to cut
the deficit and end Bush-era tax cuts. S&P’s decision was at
odds with the other two main ratings companies, Moody’s
Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. Moody’s reiterated its top
Aaa rating for the U.S. yesterday, citing the dollar’s status as
the main  reserve currency .  GDP Growth  Economists estimate U.S. GDP will rise 2.5 percent in 2011,
down from forecasts of 3.2 percent earlier this year, according
to the median estimate of 63 respondents in a Bloomberg survey.
The economy expanded at a 3 percent rate in 2010, Commerce
Department data show.  Investors retreating from stocks have poured money into
traditional havens such as  government bonds . Treasuries surged
yesterday, pushing 10-year note yields to the lowest level since
January 2009, while gold futures for December delivery climbed
$61.40, or 3.7 percent, to settle at $1,713.20 an ounce, the
biggest gain since March 19, 2009. The Swiss franc climbed to a
record 74.85 centimes to the dollar.  S&P 500 Performance  While the S&P 500 is still up 65 percent since the bull
market began in March 2009 and had doubled through the end of
April, the index has plunged 17 percent since July 22, wiping
out about $2 trillion in equity value. Speculation about the
impact of a U.S. credit downgrade and the slowdown in the
nation’s manufacturing and consumer spending overshadowed
better-than-estimated profit growth.  Companies in the S&P 500 that have reported second-quarter
earnings since July 11 have beaten estimates by an average 5.1
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profits are up
about 18 percent from last year’s second quarter and sales
increased 13 percent, the data show. While the S&P 500 is
forecast for 18 percent earnings growth this year, analysts
project the Russell 2000’s profits will grow 40 percent to $35 a
share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The bear market reflects that people doubt that that’s
going to be the case,” Steven DeSanctis, the chief small-cap
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a telephone
interview yesterday. “Small-caps are much more U.S.-focused,
U.S.-economically sensitive, so when the  U.S. economy  does
poorly, the smaller companies’ earnings numbers come down more
dramatically than the large caps.”  AMR, CSX  AMR Corp. (AMR) , the parent of  American Airlines , is down 38
percent since July 7. The Fort Worth, Texas-based company posted
earnings and sales last month that fell short of analyst
estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A deterioration in
 consumer confidence  and the economic outlook is putting third-
quarter airline earnings under pressure, posing a “worry,” the
 International Air Transport Association  said Aug. 3.  CSX Corp. (CSX) , the biggest eastern U.S. railroad, had its
rating cut to “neutral” from “outperform” yesterday by
Robert W. Baird & Co., which said “investors have become
increasingly concerned about the sustainability of the current
economic recovery.” The Jacksonville, Florida-based company has
lost 16 percent this month, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  BioMimetic Therapeutics Inc. (BMTI) , an orthopedic drug-device
company in the Russell 2000, has plummeted 80 percent since
April 29, the second-worst of all stocks in the index. The
Franklin, Tennessee-based company missed analyst sales
projections last quarter by 18 percent. Russell 2000 stocks have
been beating forecasts by 2.4 percent, Bloomberg data show.  Aeropostale’s Sales  Aeropostale Inc. (ARO) , which depends on the U.S. for 94 percent
of its revenue, said earlier this month that comparable sales
last quarter fell 14 percent. The teen-clothing retailer has
fallen 54 percent since April 29.  U.S. stock funds saw $8.8 billion in net outflows in the
week ending July 27, according to estimates from Washington-
based  Investment Company Institute . Investors have been pulling
funds from equities every week in July and took out $20.8
billion in June, the biggest month of outflows since October
2008. Bond funds got $12.9 billion that month, ICI data show.  “We’re seeing a flight to quality out of stocks, into
bonds and into gold on the fear of a potential and much more
significant reality of double-dip recession,”  Richard Weiss , a
Mountain View, California-based senior portfolio manager at
American Century Investments, who lowered his small-cap holdings
a few months ago, said in a telephone interview yesterday. His
firm oversees about $108 billion.  “There’s a deceleration,” Weiss said. “It’s arguable
whether it’s going to pull us into recession territory, but the
markets are clearly falling on the economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
