The Bank of Korea pledged to increase
supply of liquidity in won and foreign currencies if a flight of
overseas capital triggers a surge in borrowing costs.  The central bank said in a report submitted to parliament
that it won’t make any abrupt changes to the portfolio of its
foreign-exchange reserve holdings, while improving liquidity by
holding sufficient amounts of short-term treasuries and deposits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
