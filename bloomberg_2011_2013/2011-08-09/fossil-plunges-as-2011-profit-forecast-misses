Fossil Inc. (FOSL) , the maker of the
namesake watch brand, plunged in Nasdaq trading after
forecasting fiscal 2011 profit that trailed analysts’ estimates
as costs rise and consumers curtail spending.  Fossil fell $11.74, or 13 percent, to $82.15 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. The shares
have gained 17 percent this year.  Profit per share may be $4.44 to $4.50 this fiscal year,
Richardson, Texas-based Fossil said today in a statement. The
average estimate of eight analysts was $4.63. Fossil began to
experience higher production costs in the second quarter and
expects the economy to begin to affect demand, Chief Executive
Officer Kosta Kartsotis said on a conference call today.  “We certainly cannot overlook the recent negative economic
events taking place,” Kartsotis said on the call. “Even though
we continue to experience very favorable trends across our
brands and geographies, we would not expect to be immune to
consumer spending cutbacks.”  Labor rates at Fossil’s China-based factories have
increased 32 percent this year, including appreciation in the
renmibi, Chief Financial Officer Mike Kovar said on the call.
The price of silver has more than doubled in the last year.  In May, Fossil rose to the highest price since its 1993
initial public offering after raising its earnings forecast. The
company also sells handbags, sunglasses and other accessories in
120 countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
