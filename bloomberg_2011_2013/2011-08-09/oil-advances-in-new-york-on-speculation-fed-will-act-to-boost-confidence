Crude oil tumbled to the lowest level
since September after the  Federal Reserve  said risks to the
economy have increased and didn’t announce asset purchases.
Prices rebounded in electronic trading after the settlement.  Oil fell 2.5 percent as Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and
his colleagues pledged to keep the benchmark  interest rate  at a
record low through mid-2013 and said they are “prepared to
employ” more tools “as appropriate.” Economists including
 Kenneth Rogoff , a Harvard University economics professor and
former Fed researcher, had said the Fed was likely to start a
third round of quantitative easing.  “They didn’t do something that would have a tangible and
immediate impact,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige
Economics LLC in Austin,  Texas . “Without QE3 to sort of give a
sentiment and capital boost to the markets, the negative
economic news is going to be a bigger drag that could weigh on
crude.”  Oil for September delivery dropped $2.01 to $79.30 on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since Sept.
29. Futures have fallen 17 percent in August and 13 percent this
year.  Prices advanced from the settlement after equities rose and
the  American Petroleum Institute  reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S.
crude-oil stockpiles decreased 5.21 million barrels to 348.6
million. September oil rose 86 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $82.17
a barrel in electronic trading at 5:03 p.m.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, surged to 69.1 percent at 4 p.m. in New
York from 61.5 percent yesterday and 33.1 percent a week ago.
New York futures have tumbled 31 percent from a two-year high of
$114.83 a barrel on May 2.  Brent Falls  Brent oil for September settlement fell $1.17, or 1.1
percent, to $102.57 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in  London , the lowest closing price since Feb. 18.  The major stock indexes rose at least 4 percent after
erasing losses in the last 75 minutes of trading. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rose 4.7 percent to 1,172.53, and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  gained 4 percent to 11,239.77.  “Economic growth so far this year has been considerably
slower than the committee had expected,” the Fed statement
said. The central bank also said it expects a “somewhat slower
pace of recovery over coming quarters,” adding that “downside
risks to the economic outlook have increased.”  Fed policy makers acted after reports showed the economy
was slowing and an unprecedented downgrade to the U.S. credit
rating last week by  Standard & Poor’s  triggered a markets rout
from Sydney to New York.  Stimulating Demand  “The market is concerned that the Fed isn’t going to do
enough to stimulate demand for oil,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago  “We’re not going to
necessarily see a QE3 at this time, which is disappointing for
the oil bulls.”  Earlier today, the Energy Department cut its forecast for
U.S. oil consumption in 2011 to 19.02 million barrels a day from
last month’s forecast of 19.18 million in its monthly Short-Term
Energy Outlook. Next year’s demand is projected to climb to
19.19 million. The U.S. is the world’s largest oil-consuming
country.  The U.S. also cut its price forecast for 2011 by 2.8
percent to $95.71 a barrel.  OPEC Cuts Forecasts  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its
oil demand forecasts for this year and next as the global
economic recovery loses momentum. The group reduced its 2011
consumption estimate by 150,000 barrels a day. That means global
demand will rise by 1.2 million barrels a day, or 1.4 percent,
to 88.1 million. Next year it will increase by 1.5 percent to
89.4 million, following a “minor downward revision,” the
organization said in its monthly market report.  The Energy Department boosted its global demand estimate to
88.19 million barrels, up from the previous 88.16 million. It
predicted 2012 demand of 89.83 million barrels a day.  Prices also dropped as U.S. oil supplies probably rose for
a third week, adding 1.35 million barrels in the seven days
ended Aug. 5 as the government released barrels from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the median of 12
analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. The Energy
Department reports tomorrow.  Supply, Demand  U.S. oil supply and demand fundamentals “remain firm,”
even with the battery of negative economic news and as prices
have fallen,  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group Inc.
energy advisory company in Villanova,  Pennsylvania , said in a
note to clients. He cited as evidence the shrinking spread
between the September and October Nymex crude contracts, which
was 37 cents today, the smallest differential since July 22.  OPEC has no plans “so far” to hold an emergency meeting
in response to recent price declines, said an OPEC delegate who
isn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and declined to
be identified by name. OPEC is worried about the global economy
and falling demand, according to the delegate, who said the
organization doesn’t have a specific price target that would
trigger action.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 972,849
contracts as of 5:03 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 947,090
contracts yesterday, 40 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.55 million contracts, the
highest level since June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
