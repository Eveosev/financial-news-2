The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default soared, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 29.5
basis points to 605, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 7 a.m.
in London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and an increase signals deteriorating
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 6.5 basis points to 147 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers climbed 6 basis points to 224 basis
points and the subordinated index was up 15 at 395.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
