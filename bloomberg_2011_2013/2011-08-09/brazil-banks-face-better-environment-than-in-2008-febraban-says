Brazilian banks face a better
financial environment now than during the 2008 financial crisis,
Brazilian Bank Association President Murilo  Portugal  said in an
interview.  The situation now “is not as serious as in 2008, when
there was widespread suspicion among banks over the financial
health of the institutions and their counterparts,” Portugal, a
former International Monetary Fund deputy managing director,
said in an interview from  Sao Paulo  yesterday.  Brazilian financial shares fell 9.6 percent to 678.38
yesterday, the biggest decline since November 2008, in the first
trading day after the U.S. credit rating downgrade by  Standard &
Poor’s , according to the MSCI Brazil/Financials Index of twelve
financial stocks.  The effect of the U.S. downgrade may be short-term, and the
U.S. and the world shouldn’t fall into a recession again,
Portugal added.  “There will be a long period of low growth rates, but not
recession,” said Portugal, whose association is known as
Febraban.  Brazil  has been hurt by the U.S. downgrade mostly in the
stock market, specifically in banking and commodities-related
shares, Portugal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
