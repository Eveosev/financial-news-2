The yen gained against the majority
of its most-traded counterparts as the  Federal Reserve ’s pledge
to keep interest rates at a record low until mid-2013 failed to
convince investors global growth will be buoyed.  The euro fell against the dollar amid speculation Europe’s
debt crisis would spread to  France , the region’s second-biggest
economy. The greenback gained against most major peers. The
Swiss franc weakened versus the yen and dollar after the
nation’s central bank said it expanded measures to curb the
currency’s strength.  “The Fed statement may have fallen a little bit short of
what some in the market were hoping for,” said  Omer Esiner ,
chief market analyst in  Washington  at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange Inc., a currency brokerage. “The Fed clearly and very
bluntly highlighted the weakness in the economy. The market is
not really going to find too much solace in that statement given
that all these uncertainties and all these headwinds remain.”  The Japanese currency strengthened 1.5 percent against the
euro to 108.97 at 5 p.m. in  New York , from 110.63 yesterday. The
yen rose 0.1 percent to 76.86 per dollar and touched 76.35,
approaching the post-World War II high of 76.25 that it reached
on March 17. The franc fell 0.8 percent to 72.66 centimes per
dollar, down from an all-time high of 70.71 centimes yesterday.
It rose 0.6 percent to 1.0300 per euro after reaching a record
1.0075 yesterday.  The dollar gained 1.4 percent to $1.4178 per euro, from
$1.4376 yesterday, when it weakened 1.4 percent.  15 Percent Rise  The franc surged 15 percent over the past month against
nine other developed-nation currencies tracked by the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The yen rose 3.6 percent.
The dollar fell 1.2 percent, and the euro lost 0.1 percent.  The greenback pared losses against the yen after a Treasury
Department auction of $24 billion of U.S. 10-year notes drew a
record low yield of 2.14 percent. It was the first offering of
the maturity since Standard & Poor’s cut the U.S. credit rating
last week to AA+, from AAA.  “The downgrade notwithstanding, there’s still a general
flight to quality and the U.S. is still perceived as that,”
said  John McCarthy , managing director of  currency trading  at ING
Groep NV in New York.  Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said in parliament
today that one-sided moves in the yen can hurt the nation’s
growth. The currency strengthened to 76.97 on Aug. 4 before the
nation sold yen that day to weaken it.  Speculation on France  The euro slid as shares of Societe Generale SA, France’s
second-biggest lender, plunged 15 percent, the most in more than
2 1/2 years, after speculation France’s creditworthiness was in
doubt. BNP Paribas SA, France’s largest bank, slid 9.5 percent
and Credit Agricole SA slumped 12 percent.  France’s top credit grade was affirmed by Standard &
Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings as yields on
the nation’s debt climbed.  France’s borrowing costs are rising as  Europe ’s debt crisis
makes investors wary of lending to any nation other than
 Germany . Investors currently demand about 90 basis points, or
0.9 percentage point, of extra yield to buy 10-year French debt
rather than German bunds, even though both carry AAA grades from
the major rating companies. That spread is almost triple the
2010 average of 33 basis points.  The  European Central Bank  purchased Spanish and Italian
 government bonds  for a third day, according to four people with
knowledge of the transactions, to drive yields lower. The amount
of securities acquired was smaller than in the past two days,
said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because
the trades are confidential.  Fed’s Pledge  The Fed pledged yesterday to keep its benchmark  interest
rate  at zero to 0.25 percent at least through mid-2013 to revive
a recovery that’s “considerably slower” than anticipated. The
U.S. central bank is “prepared to employ” additional tools to
bolster an economy hobbled by weak hiring and anemic household
spending, it said in a statement.  The central bank statement helped the  Standard & Poor’s  500
Index rally 4.7 percent yesterday. It fell 4.4 percent today,
while the Stoxx Europe 600 lost 3.8 percent.  “You’re looking at a pullback today,” said  Fabian Eliasson , head of U.S. currency sales at Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. in New York. “It seems like the rally yesterday wasn’t
sustainable.”  Swiss National Bank   The Swiss National Bank said in a  statement  it will
“significantly increase” the supply of liquidity to the money
market and expand banks’ sight deposits, or cash that can be
withdrawn on demand, to 120 billion Swiss francs ($165 billion)
from 80 billion francs. It will also conduct foreign-exchange
swap transactions to create liquidity. The measure was last used
in 2008, the SNB said.  The pound depreciated versus the dollar as the  Bank of
England  said the outlook for growth has weakened and the most
likely scenario is that inflation will fall below its target in
the medium term. Sterling dropped 1.1 percent to $1.6134 and
rose 0.3 percent to 87.87 pence per euro.  South Korea ’s won rose against all 16 of its most-traded
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg after Statistics Korea said
today the nation’s jobless rate was unchanged at 3.3 percent in
July. The won gained 0.7 percent to 1,080.20 per dollar.  New Zealand’s dollar and  Mexico ’s peso were the worst
performers among major currencies. The South Pacific currency
dropped 3.1 percent to 81.12 U.S. cents, and the peso tumbled
4.1 percent to 12.5536 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
