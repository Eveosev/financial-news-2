A bipartisan group of U.S. senators
called on President  Barack Obama  to impose sanctions on the
Central Bank of Iran to help thwart Iran’s nuclear programs.  “We must do more to increase the economic pressure on the
regime,” the senators wrote today in a letter to Obama.  The letter was signed by 92 senators, led by  Mark Kirk , a
Republican from Illinois, and  Charles Schumer , a Democrat from
New York.  “The time has come to impose crippling sanctions on Iran’s
financial system by cutting off the CBI,” the senators wrote,
referring to the Central Bank of Iran. “There is strong
bipartisan support in Congress for the imposition of
sanctions.”  David Cohen, undersecretary of the Treasury for terrorism
and financial intelligence, said in May that “the activities
off the  Central Bank  of Iran have been, and continue to be, a
focus of the Treasury Department,” the letter noted.  The bank “lies at the center” of Iran’s efforts to
circumvent U.S. and multilateral sanctions, the senators said.  The Central Bank of Iran, also known as Bank Markazi, was
created in 1960 and remains the primary “banker to the
government” of Iran, according to a press release issued by
Kirk and Schumer.  The U.S. in May imposed sanctions on seven foreign
companies for doing business with Iran’s energy industry in ways
that might bolster the country’s “illicit” nuclear activities,
according to the State Department. It also imposed sanctions on
16 non-U.S. companies and individuals for aiding weapons and
missile programs in Iran,  North Korea  and Syria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
