The following is the text of the
U.S. productivity and costs report for the second quarter
released by the Labor Department.  Nonfarm business sector labor productivity decreased at
a 0.3 percent annual rate during the second quarter of 2011,
the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today, with
output and hours worked rising 1.8 percent and 2.0 percent,
respectively. (All quarterly percent changes in this release
are seasonally adjusted annual rates.) From the second
quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2011, output
increased 2.5 percent while hours rose 1.6 percent, yielding
an increase in productivity of 0.8 percent.  Labor productivity, or output per hour, is calculated by
dividing an index of real output by an index of hours worked
of all persons, including employees, proprietors, and unpaid
family workers.  Unit labor costs in nonfarm businesses rose 2.2 percent
in the second quarter of 2011, because hourly compensation
increased 1.9 percent while productivity decreased 0.3
percent. Over the last four quarters, hourly compensation
increased more than output per hour, and unit labor costs
rose 1.3 percent.  BLS defines unit labor costs as the ratio of hourly
compensation to  labor productivity ; increases in hourly
compensation tend to increase unit labor costs and increases
in output per hour tend to reduce them.  Data in this release reflect the regular multi-year
revision to the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA)
released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S.
Department of Commerce on July 29, 2011. See Revised
Measures.  Manufacturing sector productivity fell 2.0 percent in
the second quarter of 2011, as output rose 0.6 percent and
hours increased 2.6 percent. Over the last four quarters,
manufacturing productivity increased 2.3 percent. Unit labor
costs in manufacturing increased 4.4 percent in the second
quarter of 2011 and were unchanged (0.0 percent) over the
last four quarters.  Productivity fell 3.5 percent in the durable goods
sector in the second quarter of 2011 as a 5.1 percent
increase in hours outpaced a 1.4 percent increase in output.
In contrast, nondurable goods manufacturing productivity
increased 1.2 percent as hours decreased faster than output.  The data sources and methods used in the preparation of
the manufacturing output series differ from those used in
preparing the business and nonfarm business output series,
and these measures are not directly comparable. See Technical
Notes for further information on data sources.  Nonfinancial corporate sector productivity increased 1.4
percent in the first quarter of 2011 as output and hours rose
3.6 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively.  Revised Measures  Measures of output for the business, nonfarm business,
and nonfinancial corporate (NFC) sectors, and compensation
for all sectors incorporate the revised National Income and
Product Accounts (NIPA) data released on July 29 by the
 Bureau of Economic Analysis , U.S. Department of Commerce. As
a result, output and related series, including productivity
and unit labor costs, were revised back to 1947 for the
business and nonfarm business sectors, and back to 2000 for
the NFC sector. Hours and related measures were revised back
to 2002 for the business and nonfarm business sectors, and
back to 1997 for nonfinancial corporations. These revisions
were due to the incorporation of 2007 Economic Census final
data on employment, as well as revised NIPA data on
compensation of all employees and employment in government
enterprises.  In the first quarter of 2011, nonfarm business
productivity declined 0.6 percent, rather than increasing 1.8
percent, reflecting a downward revision of 2.3 percentage
points to output. Hourly compensation increased 4.2 percent
in the first quarter, a larger gain than reported June 2.
Consequently, unit labor costs were revised upward to 4.8
percent. In the manufacturing sector, productivity growth in
the first quarter remained at 4.2 percent, due to offsetting
upward revisions to output and hours. Unit labor costs
declined 1.1 percent rather than 1.4 percent as reported June
2.  For the year 2010, nonfarm business productivity growth
was revised up to 4.1 percent from the 3.9 percent increase
reported June 2, the result of a larger upward revision to
output than hours.  Unit labor costs declined 2.0 percent--
the largest decline in the annual series which begins in
1948. In manufacturing, productivity growth was unchanged at
5.9 percent. Unit labor costs fell 4.0 percent, the largest
decline in the series which extends back to 1988.  For the year 2009, nonfarm business productivity growth
was revised down to 2.3 percent from the previous estimate of
3.7 percent due to a downward revision in output.  Unit labor
costs declined 0.7 percent, a smaller decline than reported
June 2. Manufacturing productivity declined 0.4 percent, as
reported previously. The 4.9 percent increase in unit labor
costs was less than the 6.1 percent increase published June
2, due to a downward revision to hourly compensation.  For the year 2008, nonfarm business productivity was
revised down to 0.6 percent from 1.0 percent as output was
revised downward. Unit labor costs were revised up to 2.8
percent. In manufacturing, productivity, hours and output
changed at the same rates reported previously. Unit labor
costs were revised upward to 4.7 percent.  Nonfarm business productivity increased at an average
annual rate of 2.5 percent from 2000 to 2010 rather than the
2.7 percent rate reported June 2. Manufacturing productivity
grew at an annual average rate of 3.2 percent from 2000 to
2010, as previously reported.  In the nonfinancial corporate sector, first-quarter 2011
productivity growth was revised down to 1.4 percent from the
preliminary estimate of 4.1 percent. For the year 2010,
productivity was revised down to 5.3 percent due to a
downward revision in output. In 2009 productivity was revised
down to 1.6 percent as the downward revision to output was
greater than the downward revision to hours. Unit labor costs
were unchanged by revisions in 2010 and 2009 because downward
revisions to productivity were offset by downward revisions
to hourly compensation.  The revised Productivity and Costs press release for
second-quarter 2011 is scheduled to be released on Thursday,
September 1, 2011 at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).
