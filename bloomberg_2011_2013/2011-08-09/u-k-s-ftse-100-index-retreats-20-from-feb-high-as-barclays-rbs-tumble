U.K. stocks slumped, sending the
benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  tumbling 20 percent from this year’s
high in February, as continued concern about the strength of the
global economy sent financial and commodity shares lower.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,  Old Mutual Plc (OML)  and Royal
Dutch Shell Group Plc all tumbled more than 5 percent in London
trading.  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  lost 4.3 percent as Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. recommended that investors sell the shares.  Tate & Lyle Plc (TATE) 
slumped 5 percent amid speculation the company may bid for Solae
LLC.  The FTSE 100 Index sank 175.43, or 3.5 percent, to 4,893.52
at 10:30 a.m. in London, extending the gauge’s decline from this
year’s high on Feb. 2 to 20 percent. The FTSE All-Share Index
lost 3.4 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 2.5
percent.  “Investors are really taking their cue from macroeconomics
and the outlook on global growth,” said Colin McLean, chief
executive officer at SVM Asset Management Ltd. in Edinburgh.
“We haven’t seen any redemption pressure at all, which is
encouraging. The speed of the moves down has left private
investors unwilling to sell where we are now.”  U.K. stocks paced a global rout in equities, tumbling
almost 10 percent last week after U.S. manufacturing and
consumer-spending data heightened concern that a recovery for
the world’s largest economy may be at risk.  Reports today showed U.K. manufacturing unexpectedly fell
in June and the  trade gap  widened, adding to evidence that the
economic recovery is faltering. Separate data showed exports in
 Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy, declined in June, while Swiss
 consumer confidence  weakened more than forecast in July.  RBS, HSBC, Barclays  RBS led a selloff in banks, tumbling 9.9 percent to 24.57
pence. Barclays sank 7.6 percent to 162 pence and  HSBC Holdings
Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest bank and the largest stock on the FTSE 100
by index weight, dropped 6.2 percent to 504.3 pence.  Old Mutual Plc, the U.K.’s third-largest insurer by market
value, declined 5.6 percent to 101.8 pence.  Aviva Plc (AV/)  slid 2.8
percent to 323.9 pence and  Prudential Plc (PRU)  declined 2.9 percent
to 580 pence.  Shell, Europe’s biggest oil company, lost 5.1 percent to
1,794 pence as crude oil tumbled to its lowest price in more
than 10 months in  New York .  BP Plc (BP/)  declined 4.3 percent to 385.9
pence and  BG Group Plc (BG/)  retreated 4 percent to 1,141.5 pence.  Elsewhere, BAE Systems decreased 4.3 percent to 245.1 pence
as Goldman Sachs said investors should sell Europe’s largest
defense company, citing poor growth prospects.  Tate & Lyle fell 5 percent to 517.5 pence after three
people with knowledge of the matter said Solae, a soy joint
venture owned by DuPont Co. and Bunge Ltd., has drawn offers
from companies including Tate & Lyle.  KKR & Co. and other private-equity firms also bid, said one
of the people, who declined to be identified as the process is
private. Suitors are studying confidential financial information
on the business, which may fetch as much as $1.75 billion, one
person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
