Canada ’s dollar rose the most in more
than a year versus its U.S. counterpart after the  Federal
Reserve  pledged to keep its benchmark  interest rate  at a record
low at least through mid-2013, and traders speculated recent
losses in the currency were unsustainable.  The Canadian currency rose for the first time in eight days
after reaching the weakest level in six months, as U.S. stocks
rallied and crude oil, Canada’s largest export, pared an earlier
loss to trade above $80 a barrel. The loonie, as the currency is
called, depreciated through parity with the  U.S. dollar  today
for the first time since February.  “The Canadian dollar has been beaten up along with other
pro-risk currencies for the better part of a week now,” said
 Shane Enright ,  executive director  in Toronto at Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce’s  CIBC World Markets . “A relief rally
was overdue.”  Canada’s dollar appreciated as much as 1.8 percent, the
biggest intraday jump since May 2010, to 97.70 cents per U.S.
dollar before trading at 97.72 cents at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It
closed yesterday at 99.45 cents. The currency declined earlier
today to C$1.0010, the weakest level since Feb. 1. One Canadian
dollar buys $1.0221.  The loonie climbed as U.S. stocks rallied the most in more
than two years as the Fed said it was prepared to use a range of
tools to bolster the economy following yesterday’s rout in
equities. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained as much as 2.9
percent in midday trading, then dropped 1.6 percent following
the Fed’s statement before resuming its advance. It was up 4.7
percent at closing, the most since March 2009,  Financial stocks, which paced a slide that erased $1
trillion in market value yesterday, soared more than 8 percent.  Parity With Greenback  The loonie slid earlier today to parity with its American
counterpart for the first time since February after S&P’s
credit-rating downgrade of the U.S. on Aug. 5 sparked the
biggest sell-off in risk assets since the credit crunch three
years ago.  “There’s still a story in that there’s value in Canadian-
based assets,”  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at
Bank of Nova Scotia’s Scotia Capital, said by phone from
Toronto. “Investors will be looking to diversify away from the
U.S.- and European-based assets. That should build fairly well
for the Canadian dollar.”  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, rose 0.6
percent to $81.83 a barrel in  New York  after falling to $75.71 a
barrel, the lowest level since September 2010.  Housing Starts  Canadian housing starts climbed in July at the fastest pace
in 15 months, adding to evidence the country’s real estate
market remains buoyant as borrowing costs stay low.  Work began on 205,100 units on a seasonally adjusted annual
basis, the fastest pace since April 2010, after a revised
reading of 196,600 units in June, Canada Mortgage and Housing
Corp. said today in Ottawa. Economists forecast a reading of
194,500, according to the median forecast of 16 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Government bonds  fell after yesterday’s rally, pushing the
yield on two-year debt up four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 0.85 percent. The price of the 2 percent security
maturing in August 2013 fell 9 cents on the dollar to C$102.25.
The yield ended yesterday at 0.81 percent, the lowest level in
at least 22 years.  Canada’s dollar has declined 5.1 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, a
gauge of 10 developed-market currencies. The greenback has
fallen 7.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
