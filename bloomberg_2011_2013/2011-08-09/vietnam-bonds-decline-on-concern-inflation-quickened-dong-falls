Vietnam ’s five-year bonds declined on
speculation inflation quickened, leaving little room for the
central bank to ease monetary policy and bolster economic growth.
The dong weakened.  “Investors are still concerned that inflation hasn’t
peaked and may keep accelerating this month,” said Luu Hai Yen,
Hanoi-based analyst at Thang Long Securities Joint-Stock Co.
“There are no signs that inflation will ease and  interest rates 
will decrease.”  The yield rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 12.57 percent, according to a daily fixing from banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  Vietnam’s inflation accelerated for an 11th straight month
in July to 22.16 percent, official data show.  The dong weakened 0.3 percent to 20,802 per dollar as of
4:30 p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,608 today,
unchanged since July 11. The currency is allowed to trade up to
1 percent on either side of the official rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
