Citigroup Inc. (C)  led banks higher in
New York trading as investors bought shares at two-year lows
following the U.S.  credit-rating  downgrade and amid speculation
that the  Federal Reserve  may take steps to spur the economy.  The 24-company  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  rose 4.1 percent to 38.51,
the biggest jump since July last year, at 10:40 a.m in New York.
Citigroup gained 12 percent to $31.28, and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
advanced 7.8 percent to $7.02. Both firms had plunged more than
16 percent yesterday after Standard & Poor’s Aug. 5 decision to
strip the U.S. of its top credit rating.  “Markets tend to overshoot, I think that’s what happened
here,” said Jonathan Finger, whose family-owned investment
company, Finger Interests Ltd., owns 1.1 million Bank of
America shares. Regarding the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based
company, managers “have done things to reduce risk on their
balance sheet and increased liquidity on the holding company.”  Fed policy makers, who meet today, may strengthen their
commitment to record monetary stimulus after a faltering
economic recovery and the credit-rating cut provoked a rout in
global stocks. By a 52 percent to 48 percent margin, respondents
in a Bloomberg News survey said the Fed would ease policy this
year through monetary tools or statement language.  To contact the reporter on this story:
