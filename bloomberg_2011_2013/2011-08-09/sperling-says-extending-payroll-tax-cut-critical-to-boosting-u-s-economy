White House economic adviser  Gene
Sperling  said extending a temporary payroll tax cut is critical
to boosting the economy and the government must demonstrate that
it will be “aggressive” in cutting the deficit.  The U.S. must take actions for short-term growth as well as
stabilizing the nation’s debt over the long term, Sperling,
director of President Barack Obama’s National Economic Council,
said in a Bloomberg Television interview.  Negotiations on the debt and the economy must involve
compromise from both Democrats and Republicans because the
current standoff “has had real negative consequences for the
economy,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
