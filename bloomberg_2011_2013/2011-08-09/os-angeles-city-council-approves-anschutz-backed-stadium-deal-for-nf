The Los Angeles City Council voted to
pursue a $1.4 billion football stadium and convention center
remodeling project with Anschutz Entertainment Group Inc.  The entertainment company, controlled by Denver billionaire
 Philip Anschutz , has asked the city to sell $275 million in
municipal bonds to tear down part of the existing center, where
the stadium will be put, and build an addition.  Construction would not begin until the project passes state
environmental reviews and Anschutz finds a National Football
League team to play in the stadium.  City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana said in a July
25 interview that terms of the deal changed since Los Angeles
first began negotiating with Anschutz earlier this year. The
developer agreed to reduce the amount of debt to be issued and
to back bond payments with new taxes on its current downtown
properties including  L.A. Live , a hotel and entertainment
complex Anschutz opened in 2008.  Los Angeles  has $417 million in debt outstanding on its
existing convention center buildings, which cost the city $14
million annually following promises 26 years ago the facility
would be self-sufficient.  To contact the reporter on this story: Christopher Palmeri in
