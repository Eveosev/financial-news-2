The  New Zealand dollar  fell against
its U.S. counterpart on concern global growth prospects are too
limited to sustain demand for higher-yielding currencies.  The kiwi, as New Zealand’s currency is nicknamed, slid
versus all of its 16 major peers as the Federal Reserve’s pledge
to hold down interest rates failed to calm anxiety that growth
is slowing worldwide. The Australian dollar dropped versus the
yen and the greenback after a report showed  consumer confidence 
slumped to its lowest in more than two years.  “Global growth might be weaker than people were previously
expecting,” said Roland Randall, an economist at Toronto-
Dominion Bank’s TD Securities unit in Singapore. “Commodity
demand should be actually lower, therefore the Aussie dollar and
 New Zealand  dollar” declined.  New Zealand’s dollar dropped 3 percent to 81.19 U.S. cents
at 11:06 a.m. in  New York  from 83.73 cents in New York
yesterday, when it fell to 79.66 cents, its weakest since May
25. It fell 3.6 percent to 62.12 yen from 64.45 yen.  Australia’s dollar fell 1.7 percent to $1.0176 from $1.0355
yesterday, when it touched 99.28 U.S. cents, the lowest since
March 18. The Aussie fell 2.3 percent to 77.88 yen from 79.70
yen.  The Fed yesterday pledged to keep its benchmark interest
rate at a record low at least through mid-2013. The  Federal Open
Market Committee  discussed a range of policy tools to bolster
the economy and it’s “prepared to employ these tools as
appropriate,” it said in a statement in Washington.  Australia’s sentiment index slid 3.5 percent in August to
89.6 from a month earlier, the lowest since May 2009, according
to a  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and Melbourne Institute survey of
1,200 consumers taken Aug. 1-6 and released today in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
