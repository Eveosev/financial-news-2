OAO Rosneft,  Russia â€™s largest oil
producer, headed for its lowest in more than 11 months as crude
slumped in  New York .  The shares dropped 4.4 percent to 198.1 rubles by 1:10 p.m.
in Moscow, poised for the lowest since Sept. 28.  Crude for September delivery fell as much as $5.60, or 6.9
percent a barrel to $75.71 as the U.S. credit-rating cut and
rising stockpiles stoked concern a slowing economy will reduce
demand for fuel.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
