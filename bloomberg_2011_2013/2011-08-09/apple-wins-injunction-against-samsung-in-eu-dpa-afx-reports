Apple Inc. (AAPL)  has won a temporary order
preventing Samsung Electronics Co. from distributing the Galaxy
Tab 10.1 tablet computer in the European Union except the
Netherlands, dpa-AFX reported, citing unidentified people
involved in the court negotiations.  Apple is accusing Samsung of violating intellectual
property rights and of copying its iPad, dpa-AFX said.
A district court in Dusseldorf,  Germany , granted the injunction,
the news service said.  “We can’t confirm this,” Annika Karstadt, a spokeswoman
for Samsung in Germany, said by telephone when reached by
Bloomberg News. “We’re looking into it.”  Georg Albrecht, an Apple spokesman in Germany, couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
