China ’s inflation accelerated to the
fastest pace in three years in July, limiting the scope for
monetary easing to support growth as plunging stock markets
signal the global recovery is weakening.  Consumer prices climbed 6.5 percent from a year earlier as
food costs surged, reports from the Beijing-based  National
Bureau of Statistics  showed today. That was more than the 6.4
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 26
economists. In June, inflation was 6.4 percent.  Elevated inflation shows that China is still dealing with
the after-effects of an unprecedented monetary expansion during
the last global slump and may have limited room for more
stimulus. At the same time, a weaker-than-forecast gain in
 industrial production  added to signs that a moderation in
economic growth may help to cool price pressures.  “This is the kind of data that should trigger an interest
rate hike, but the uncertainties in global financial markets may
delay the action,” said Yao Wei, a Hong Kong-based economist
with Societe Generale SA.  The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed almost
unchanged after tumbling into a  bear market  yesterday on a
widening European debt crisis and  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of
the U.S. debt rating. Twelve-month non-deliverable yuan forwards
fell 0.3 percent to 6.4004 per dollar as of 5:02 p.m. in  Hong
Kong .  Industrial Production  Industrial output rose 14 percent in July from a year
earlier, less than the 14.6 percent median forecast in a survey
of economists and a 15.1 percent gain in June. Retail sales rose
17.2 percent, the statistics bureau said on its website today.  Fixed-asset investment excluding rural households climbed
25.4 percent in January-through-July from a year earlier, the
agency said.  Production, investment and sales data were “quite
resilient, suggesting China is on track for a soft landing,” Lu Ting, a Hong Kong-based economist with Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, said in a research note. The slowdown in retail sales was
mainly driven by a decline in vehicle demand, with non-auto
retail sales “robust” at around 18 percent, he said.  The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers last
month pared its forecast for the world’s largest auto market,
saying vehicle sales may grow about 5 percent instead of its
earlier estimate of 10-15 percent. Inflation may further damp
the industry’s sales, said Matthew Tsien, executive vice
president of General Motors Co.’s China unit.  Flat Growth  “What it will lead to in the near term may be more modest
levels of growth, maybe even flat growth for a period of time,”
Tsien said in an interview in Chengdu today. GM’s China
deliveries fell 1.8 percent to 173,398 vehicles in July.  China’s producer prices rose 7.5 percent in July from a
year earlier, the biggest gain in almost three years, after
jumping 7.1 percent the previous month, today’s reports showed.
Food costs climbed 14.8 percent and non-food inflation was 2.9
percent. Pork jumped 57 percent.  Merrill Lynch’s Lu said that the ruling Communist Party is
unlikely to ease monetary policy and may have a fiscal response,
including more spending on social housing and water
infrastructure. Banks already face risks from lending to local-
government financing vehicles.  “In case the global economy slows down sharply, it will
hurt Chinese exports and consumption, and the room for China to
stimulate itself out of the problem will be smaller than
2008/09,” Vincent Chan and Peggy Chan, Hong Kong-based analysts
at Credit Suisse Group AG, said in a report yesterday.  “There
is no escape.”  ‘Overwhelming Force’  European Central Bank purchases of Spanish and Italian
government debt and pledges by the Group of Seven nations and
the G-20 to support financial stability are yet to quell
investors’ concern that the global recovery is fading away.  Europe ’s debt crisis is “nowhere near an end game,”
Harvard University economist  Kenneth Rogoff  said on Bloomberg
Television today, adding that policy makers need to act with
“overwhelming force.” In the U.S., the  Federal Reserve  is
likely to embark on a third round of asset purchases, he said.  The Chinese government has already paused for eight weeks
in raising banks’ reserve requirements, the longest gap since
the latest series of increases began in November, as smaller
businesses complain of funding shortages.  Interest rates  rose as
recently as last month.  “Beijing will obviously be worried about external weakness
and global market volatility, but with inflation still too high
for comfort we continue to expect one more rate hike in the next
few months,” said  Brian Jackson , a Hong Kong-based emerging-
market strategist at Royal Bank of  Canada .  Weakening Growth  UBS AG and  Standard Chartered  Bank forecast no more rate
increases this year.  The good news for policy makers is that inflation has
likely peaked, according to analysts at lenders including
Standard Chartered. Consumer-price gains may ease to 4 percent
by year-end on smaller increases in food costs, UBS says.  Weakening global growth may also help to tame price
pressures as costs for commodities tumble. In  New York , oil
headed today for its biggest two-day plunge in more than two
years as Brent tumbled below $100 a barrel.  In China, there are signs officials are confident that
inflation will ease. Cooking oil supplier  Wilmar International
Ltd. (WIL)  has been allowed to raise prices after saying in April that
the government had asked it to hold off. The Singapore-based
company announced increases of about 5 percent on Aug. 2.  Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. estimates that full-year
average inflation will be 5.3 percent, 1.3 percentage points
higher than the government’s target. The People’s Bank of China
said Aug. 1 that it was too early to loosen monetary policy
because of the risk that inflation may accelerate.  --Nerys Avery, Paul Panckhurst and Zheng Lifei, with assistance
