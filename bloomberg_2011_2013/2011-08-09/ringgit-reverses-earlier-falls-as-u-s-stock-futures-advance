Malaysia ’s ringgit advanced,
reversing losses, on speculation a 3 percent decline in the past
five days was excessive.  U.S. stock futures swung between gains and losses ahead of
today’s meeting of the  Federal Open Market Committee  in
Washington. Harvard University economist Kenneth Rogoff predicts
the central bank will embark on a third round of asset purchases
following yesterday’s 6.7 percent plunge in the  Standard &
Poor’s  500 Index of equities.  “The selling was overdone,” said Yeo Chin Tiong, head of
financial markets at Alliance Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty in the market.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.2 percent to 3.0265 per dollar
as of 5:16 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency reached 3.0483 earlier, the weakest
level since June 29.  Standard & Poor’s triggered a selloff in global stocks
after it lowered the U.S.  credit rating  by one level to AA+ from
AAA on Aug. 5, citing failure to address the nation’s budget
deficit.  The unprecedented downgrade of the top credit rating
raises the odds that America’s recovery will falter.  A government report tomorrow may show Malaysia’s industrial
output shrank 0.8 percent in June from a year earlier after a
5.1 percent contraction in May, according to the median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Malaysian government bonds were little changed. The yield
on the 4.262 percent notes due September 2016 fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.40 percent, data from
Bursa Malaysia show.  The treasury will auction 3 billion ringgit ($991 million)
of 15-year bonds on Aug. 12, according to data published by the
central bank on its website yesterday.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
