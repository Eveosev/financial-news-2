Investor groups led by  Blackstone
Group LP (BX) , Centerbridge Capital Partners LLC and TPG submitted
initial offers for  Anglo Irish  Bank Corp.â€™s $9.65 billion of
U.S. property loans, according to four people with knowledge of
the sale process.  Colony Capital LLC also submitted a bid for some of the 248
loans, said the people, who asked not to be named because the
auction is private. Blackstone is partnering with  Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK)  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. while Centerbridge is teaming
with  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , Paulson & Co. and
 BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  and TPG Capital is pairing with Lubert-Adler
Partners LP and Pimco, the people said.  Anglo Irish, based in Dublin, is seeking to unload the
loans, backed by buildings from  Manhattan  to Beverly Hills,
after being nationalized two years ago. The competition
underscores the appetite for real estate by private-equity firms
that are pushing deeper into acquisitions as they seek profits
beyond corporate buyouts.  Eastdil Secured LLC and  FTI Consulting Inc. (FCN)  are advising
Anglo Irish on the sale, the people said. The portfolio has been
divided into eight pools, with the largest consisting of $2.26
billion of distressed office and industrial loans, according to
an offering document from Eastdil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
