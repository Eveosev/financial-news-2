Vista Capital de Expansion SA, the
buyout firm controlled by  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , is examining a sale of  Laboratorios Indas
SA , the Spanish sanitary pad maker.  Vista is working with  Morgan Stanley (MS)  to review options,
which also include refinancing, said a spokesman for the
Madrid-based buyout firm, who declined to be named, citing
company policy. Vista is leaning toward a sale of Indas, which
may be valued at about $1 billion including debt, said a person
familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified because
the process is ongoing.  No decision has been made yet, said the spokesman. Indas,
whose products include diapers and sanitary pads, had revenue of
162.6 million euros ($231.6 million) last year, according to  its
website . The company, begun more than half a century ago, sells
its products in more than 20 countries, including the U.K.,
Chile and  South Africa .  Vista bought 75 percent of Indas in 2007, with Spanish
buyout firm Inversiones Ibersuizas SA taking the rest, according
to  Ibersuizas’ website . The firms didn’t disclose the value of
the transaction at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
