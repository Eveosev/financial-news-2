Treasuries rose, with 10-year yields
declining to the lowest level since January 2009, as a slide in
stocks around the world boosted demand for the relative safety
of  U.S. government debt .  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note dropped three basis
points to 2.29 percent as of 9:04 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader pricing. The yield is the lowest since
January 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
