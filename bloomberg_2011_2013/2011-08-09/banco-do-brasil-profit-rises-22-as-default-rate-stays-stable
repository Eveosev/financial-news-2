Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3) ,  Latin America ’s
largest bank by assets, reported a 22 percent increase in profit
as default rates remained stable and credit-loss provisions rose
less than analysts estimated. The bank posted the sixth-biggest
gain in the benchmark Bovespa index.  Second-quarter net income increased to 3.33 billion reais
($2.05 billion) from 2.73 billion reais a year earlier,
Brasilia-based Banco do Brasil said in a regulatory filing
today. The mean estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for a profit of 2.96 billion reais.  Provisions for bad loans rose 15.9 percent to 3.05 billion
reais in the second quarter from the previous quarter. The
lender’s average default rate was stable at 4.2 percent in the
second quarter from the first, and fell from 5 percent in the
year-earlier period. Brazil’s average default rate was 5.6
percent, according to central bank data.  “The result was positive compared with other large banks
and credit indicators also improved, which can’t be said about
some of Banco do Brasil’s peers,” said William Castro Alves, an
analyst at brokerage XP Investimentos in Rio de Janeiro.  The bank’s shares rose 5.7 percent to 23.93 reais, while
the 66-member Bovespa index advanced 3.8 percent at 12:14 p.m.
New York time.  Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) , Brazil’s second-biggest bank bu
assets, said Aug. 2 that second-quarter credit-loss provisions
rose 29 percent to 5.11 billion reais compared with 3.96 billion
reais in the same period a year earlier. Net income climbed 14
percent to 3.6 billion reais, or 79 centavos per share, from
3.17 billion reais, or 70 centavos, a year earlier.  Forecast Cut  Banco Bradesco , the third-largest lender by assets, said
July 27 that credit-loss provisions rose 12.8 percent to 2.44
billion reais in the second quarter compared with 2.16 billion
in the year-earlier period. Net income increased 15.8 percent in
to 2.79 billion reais compared with 2.41 billion reais in the
same period a year earlier.  Banco do Brasil, led by Chief Executive Officer Aldemir
Bendine, 47, cut its forecast for loan growth after  Brazil ’s
government took measures to curb credit expansion. The lender’s
loan portfolio is likely to expand 15 percent to 18 percent this
year, down from an earlier forecast of 17 percent to 20 percent,
according to the filing.  Domestic loans climbed 17 percent to 358.6 billion reais in
the second quarter, while the bank’s amplified loan portfolio
increased 20 percent to 421.3 billion reais.  Banco do Brasil revised estimates for domestic loan growth
as an increase in capital and bank deposit requirements and a
higher benchmark interest rate will reduce lending, the bank
said in the statement.  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini, 47, increased
deposit requirements in December and raised  interest rates  five
times this year to 12.5 percent from 10.75 percent to slow
credit growth and curb inflation. Brazil’s consumer price index
rose 6.87 percent in July from the previous year, the highest in
six years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
