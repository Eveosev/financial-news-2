Guinea and China International
Water & Electric Corp. are in discussions to construct a
hydroelectric dam as the country seeks to increase power
generation, according to Energy Minister Papa Koly Kourouma.  “At the moment, talks concern the costs, environmental
management and planning” of the Kaleta dam, Kourouma said by
phone yesterday. It will be located about 150 kilometers (93
miles) northeast of Conakry, the capital, he said.  Guinea, the world’s biggest bauxite exporter, has been
turning to companies and donors to invest in projects to boost
electricity output. The West African nation is reviewing the
state-owned utility, Electricite de Guinee, and tariffs for
power and water, according to  a statement  published June 30 on
the website of the  International Monetary Fund .  In February, Kourouma said Guinea plans to spend $100
million to improve transmission by upgrading the electricity
grid that suffered from poor maintenance amid financial
shortfalls and corruption.  Construction of the Kaleta dam should begin before December
and will have a capacity of 240 megawatts, Kourouma said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
