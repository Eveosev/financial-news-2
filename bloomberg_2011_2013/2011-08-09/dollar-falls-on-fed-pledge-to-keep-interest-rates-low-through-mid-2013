The dollar tumbled the most in at
least 40 years against the Swiss franc after the  Federal Reserve 
pledged to keep its key interest rate at a record low at least
through mid-2013 to revive the flagging economic recovery.  The greenback declined versus the majority of its most-
traded peers as the Fed said growth was “considerably slower”
than it expected and it’s prepared to use a range of policy
tools to boost the economy. The meeting came a day after
economic weakening and a Standard & Poor’s U.S. credit-rating
cut spurred a global stock rout. Commodity currencies recouped
losses sustained just after the meeting. Stocks and gold surged.  “With the Fed saying they have tools available that they
are willing to use and giving a more definitive time frame, that
is overall going to be a dollar negative,” said John Doyle, a
strategist in  Washington  at the currency-trading firm Tempus
Consulting Inc. “ Swiss franc  and gold have absolutely been the
beneficiaries of uncertainty.”  The dollar fell 4.5 percent to 72.09 Swiss centimes at 5
p.m. in New York, from 75.50 yesterday. It dropped as much as
6.3 percent, the most since the beginning of Bloomberg records
in January 1971, touching a record low 70.71 centimes. The euro
dropped 3.2 percent to 1.0364 after touching the record low
1.0075. The U.S. currency depreciated 1.4 percent to $1.4376 per
euro and fell 1 percent to 76.96 yen.  “The Swiss franc is a falling knife, and no one wants to
catch it,” said  Vassili Serebriakov , a currency strategist at
 Wells Fargo & Co . in New York. “It will take a policy action to
stop and reverse the uptrend in the Swiss.”  Aussie Gains  Australia ’s dollar rose 1.7 percent to $1.0355 per
greenback after earlier dropping to $1.0064 U.S. cents just
after the Fed meeting, while the New Zealand currency climbed 2
percent to 83.74 U.S. cents after depreciating to 80.72 cents
after the meeting.  U.S. stocks rallied the most in more than two years. The
 S&P 500 Index (SPX)  climbed 4.7 percent, the biggest advance since
March 2009, after falling briefly as much as 1.6 percent
following the Fed meeting. It tumbled 6.7 percent yesterday in
its biggest drop since December 2008.  Gold for December delivery reached a record $1,782.50 an
ounce today.  The greenback rose yesterday against the majority of its
most-traded peers as investors sought safety on the first day of
trading after S&P lowered the U.S. credit rating Aug. 5  to AA+
from AAA.  FOMC Effort  The Federal Open Market Committee’s decision represents the
biggest effort since November to spark the  U.S. economy  and
revive confidence while stopping short of initiating a third
round of large-scale asset purchases. The benchmark  interest
rate  has been at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008 to
support the economy.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S. trading
partners, increased 0.3 percent on June 22 to 74.783 after
falling 0.7 percent the previous day. It dropped 1.2 percent
today to 73.902.  “The dollar obviously has tested record lows against the
Swiss franc today; I think you have to think the dollar’s going
to continue to test the downside,” Robert Sinche, global head
of currency strategy at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s RBS
Securities unit in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in an interview
on Bloomberg Television’s “Bottom Line” with Mark Crumpton.
“Certainly guaranteeing no dollar support of rate increases
through the middle of 2013, two years from now, I think is a
pretty aggressive position.”  Swiss National Bank   The Swiss franc’s gains came even after the Swiss National
Bank on Aug. 3 lowered its target for the three-month  London 
interbank offered rate to weaken the currency and protect
Switzerland’s economy.  Implied volatility, a key gauge of option prices that tends
to rise in times of uncertainty, for euro-Swiss franc one-month
options climbed to 30 percent for the first time. The equivalent
dollar-franc volatility rate reached 23.9 percent, the most
since January 2009.  Sterling declined against most of its 16 major peers
tracked by Bloomberg. U.K. factory output decreased 0.4 percent
in June from the previous month, when it rose 1.8 percent, the
Office for National Statistics said today in London. Civil
unrest that began in north London Aug. 6 spread to other parts
of the capital and other cities.  The pound fell 1.4 percent to 88.11 pence per euro.  Canada ’s currency rose 1.8 percent to at 97.72 cents per
 U.S. dollar  in its first gain in eight days.  Decline Erased  The Japanese currency has erased its decline since the
nation’s unilateral intervention in the foreign-exchange market
pushed it to as weak as 80.24 per dollar on Aug. 4. That day,
the  Bank of Japan  added 10 trillion yen ($129 billion) of
monetary stimulus. BOJ Governor Masaaki Hirakata today said
volatile exchange rates could have a “negative impact” on the
nation’s economy.  Central banks intervene in foreign-exchange markets by
selling or buying currencies to influence prices.  To contact the reporters on this story:
