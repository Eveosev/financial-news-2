Vineet Nayyar, chairman of  Satyam
Computer Services Ltd. (SCS) , comments on the impact of the U.S.
credit-rating downgrade on the information technology services
industry.  He spoke in a conference call with reporters today.  “The impetus to send work to lower cost destinations will
be even more. Still, these are uncertain times.  ‘‘The U.S. has always run a deficit -- that is not new. The
act of a downgrade doesn’t worry me at all. In the short term,
there will be some negative sentiment because of this. But I
would only worry if the fundamentals have changed, and that
hasn’t happened.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
