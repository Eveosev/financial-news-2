Devoting more and more taxpayers’
money to helping European Union members that broke the rules,
notwithstanding the strict conditions that have been imposed,
isn’t a step in the direction of European political union, but
will tend rather to divide the continent, said Otmar Issing, a
former member of the  European Central Bank ’s executive board.  Writing in the Financial Times, Issing said the idea of
selling bonds that all EU members guarantee seems sensible in
that it would lower  interest rates  for highly indebted
countries, yet it would lead to higher rates for countries that
enjoyed credibility with financial markets in the past.  Lack of fiscal discipline would be rewarded, while fiscal
solidity would be punished, and the transfer of taxpayers’ money
would take place without the involvement of national
parliaments, violating the principle of “no taxation without
representation,” Issing said.  In short, the idea that a process of transferring
taxpayers’ money that’s neither democratic, nor governed by
principles that support fiscal solidity, would be a move in the
direction of political union is wholly misleading, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
