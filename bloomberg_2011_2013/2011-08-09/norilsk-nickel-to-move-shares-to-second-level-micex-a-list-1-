OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel will move its
shares from the first level of the Micex Exchange’s so-called A
list to the second level, according to a regulatory filing by
Russia’s biggest mining company today.  Norilsk wants to “unify” its listing levels on Micex and
the RTS Stock Exchange, which have announced a merger, Norilsk’s
press officer said by phone. The spokeswoman, who declined to be
named because of company policy, wouldn’t comment further.  Companies listed on the second level of the A list aren’t
required to disclose as much information as first-level
companies, said Dmitry Smolin, an analyst at Uralsib Capital. As
a result, “some investors, such as pension funds, won’t be able
to buy,” Smolin said by phone  To contact the reporter on this story:
