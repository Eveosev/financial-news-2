South Korea ’s regulator may consider
banning short sales after the nation’s benchmark equity index
had its biggest six-day drop in three years amid concerns that
European and U.S. debt problems will lead to a global recession.  The  Financial Services Commission  will “carefully
consider” a prohibition on such transactions, Chairman Kim Seok Dong said to lawmakers today in parliament.  South Korea, which currently bars short selling on
financial stocks, would be extending the restrictions to other
equities for the first time since the peak of the global credit
crisis. The move would be part of steps taken to stabilize the
market if needed, Kim said. The  Kospi index (KOSPI)  has slid 12 percent
this year and today closed at its lowest since Sept. 9.  South  Korea  in September 2008 imposed a temporary ban on
short sales -- where investors borrow securities and sell them
while betting that the prices will drop -- following similar
actions taken by U.S. and U.K. regulators in the aftermath of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s collapse. Korea lifted the rule
in May 2009, while keeping the ban for financial stocks.  The nation already bans so-called naked short sales, where
investors don’t need to borrow the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
