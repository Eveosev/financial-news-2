Standard & Poor’s , in downgrading
U.S. sovereign debt, displayed a “stunning ignorance and
disregard” for the potential impact on the global financial
system, said  Bill Miller , the chief investment officer of Legg
Mason Capital Management Inc.  Writing in the Financial Times, he said the step, coming
after the worst week in U.S. equity markets since 2008, was
“wholly unnecessary and the timing could not have been worse.”  It’s wrong that privately owned, for-profit companies
should have “special, legally sanctioned status” as “quasi-
regulatory authorities” at the center of the financial system,
Miller said.  “Disastrously flawed” judgments by the rating companies
were at the heart of the financial crisis in 2008, and S&P’s
action “threatens mayhem again,” he said.  It’s unbelievable that S&P should think the U.S. is less
creditworthy now than two weeks ago, when the decision to raise
the debt ceiling hadn’t yet been reached; that agreement
represented progress and should have counted for, not against,
the AAA rating, Miller wrote.  He expressed the hope that the  U.S. Congress  will put an
end to the “oligopoly of Nationally Recognized Ratings
Organizations” before they trigger another crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
