rose, reducing the additional yield investors demand to hold the
securities instead of benchmark German bunds.  The yield on 10-year Spanish debt fell eight basis points

difference in yield, or spread, with German bunds by 12 basis
points to 277 basis points.  Italian 10-year yields slid seven basis points to 5.22
percent. The yield spread tightened 10 basis points to 292 basis
