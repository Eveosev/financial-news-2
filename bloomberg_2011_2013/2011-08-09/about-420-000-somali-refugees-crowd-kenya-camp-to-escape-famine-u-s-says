The world’s biggest  refugee camp  is
being expanded to cope with an influx of Somali refugees who now
number more than 420,000, the State Department said 
today.  A fourth camp is being built at the crowded Dadaab refugee
complex in  Kenya  to handle the daily arrival of Somalis escaping
Africa’s worst famine in 60 years, said Eric Schwartz, assistant
secretary of state for population, refugees and 
migration.  “The demands and the needs are growing faster than what
has been provided,” said former Senator  Bill Frist , a
Republican from Tennessee, who accompanied Jill Biden, the wife
of Vice President  Joe Biden , and other U.S. officials on a visit
to the refugee camp earlier this week.  About 29,000 children have died from the famine in the last
90 days, said Gayle Smith, special assistant to the president,
who briefed reporters by conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
