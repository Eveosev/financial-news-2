OAO  Sitronics (SITR) , billionaire  Vladimir
Yevtushenkov â€™s microchip producer, has asked the government to
make good on a promise by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to
support Russian technology companies,  Vedomosti  reported.  Yevtushenkov urged Putin  to speed up administrative
procedures to boost state purchases of locally made microchips
and impose import restrictions on foreign substitutes, the
Moscow-based newspaper, said citing a letter sent to Putin last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
