U.K. economic growth accelerated in
the three months through July as the waning effects of the
Japanese earthquake and royal wedding “flattered” the
economy’s performance, the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research said.  Gross domestic product probably expanded 0.6 percent
compared with 0.2 percent growth in the quarter through June,
the group, whose clients include the  Bank of England  and the
U.K. Treasury, said in an e-mailed statement in  London  today.  “Underlying growth is significantly weaker than the
headline number,” Niesr said. “Financial turmoil in the U.K.’s
major trading partners highlights the precarious nature of a
U.K. recovery that relies on export growth rather than domestic
consumption.”  Data today showed manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in
June, adding to evidence that the recovery is faltering as the
government implements the largest budget squeeze since World War
II. The level of GDP is 0.6 percent higher than a year ago,
Niesr said.  “Special factors continue to exert their influence,” the
group said, referring to the fact that activity in April was
depressed by two four-day weekends to mark Easter and the royal
wedding,as well as supply disruptions caused by the quake in
 Japan . The drop in economic output in April “flatters the rate
of growth in the three months to July,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
