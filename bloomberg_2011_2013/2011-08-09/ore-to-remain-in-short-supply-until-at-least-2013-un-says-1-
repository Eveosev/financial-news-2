Iron ore  will remain in short supply
until at least 2013 and possibly longer, the  United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development said in a report.  New projects will add at least 500 million metric tons and
“probably” over 600 million tons of capacity by the end of
2013, the earliest time when supply and demand will be brought
into equilibrium, according to the e-mailed report today.  “In spite of a massive pipeline of investment projects,
the market will remain tight over the next couple of years
because the large iron ore producers can implement their
expansion plans with a great deal of flexibility,” according to
the report.  Iron ore use was forecast to increase to 1.91 billion tons
in 2011, and to 1.99 billion tons in 2012, from 1.82 billion
tons in 2010.  Ore production reached a record 1.83 billion tons in 2010,
up 17.6 percent on the previous year, and along with coal
accounts for 40 percent of all commodities shipped by sea, data
compiled by the report show.  Miners  Vale SA (VALE5) , Rio Tinto Group and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) 
controlled 58 percent of the 989-million-ton world market for
seaborne ore trade in 2010, according to the report.  The ability of the three largest miners who controlled 35
percent of world production in 2010 to regulate the pace of
projects will prevent overcapacity developing, the report said.  The price of the steel-making commodity will “decline
slowly,” reaching a “floor” of $110 to $120 a ton for ore
delivered to  China , the report forecast.  The price for ore with 62 percent iron content delivered in
Tiajin port, China, today closed at $177.80 a ton, according to
The Steel Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
