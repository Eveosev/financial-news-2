Indonesia ’s rupiah declined to the
weakest level since June on concern a slowing global economic
recovery will damp demand for emerging-market assets.  Global funds sold $133.4 million more Indonesian stocks
than they bought yesterday, exchange data show. The MSCI Asia-
Pacific index of regional shares fell for a sixth day as the
 Federal Reserve  meets to bolster investor confidence after
Standard & Poor’s lowered the U.S. credit rating by one level to
AA+ on Aug. 5. Palm oil futures fell below 3,000 ringgit ($985)
a metric ton yesterday, the first time since October. Indonesia
is the world’s largest producer of the commodity.  “Lower commodity prices may affect the value of
Indonesia’s exports,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst
at PT Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta. “There’s  risk aversion 
because of uncertainty about the  U.S. economy .”  The rupiah lost 0.6 percent to 8,604 per dollar as of 9:09
a.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 8,609 earlier, the weakest level since June 29.  Bank Indonesia will keep its benchmark  interest rate  at 6.75
percent at a review today, according to economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The announcement is due at about noon in
Jakarta.  The finance ministry will auction 7 trillion rupiah ($814
million) of bonds and bills today. Ten-year benchmark notes fell
yesterday. The yield on the 8.25 percent securities due July
2021 climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.87
percent, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
