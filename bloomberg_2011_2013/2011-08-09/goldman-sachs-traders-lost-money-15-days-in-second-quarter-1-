Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the  U.S.
bank  that makes more than half its revenue from trading, lost
money in that business on 15 days during the second quarter, the
most daily losses since the fourth quarter of 2008.  The firm’s traders lost more than $100 million on one of
the days, according to the New York-based company’s quarterly
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. They
generated more than $100 million on four days out of 63 total
days, the filing showed. The second quarter ended June 30.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, last
month reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of
analysts’ estimates as fixed-income trading revenue plunged 63
percent from the first quarter. The company blamed the fixed-
income trading drop, which was more than twice as large as any
other bank’s, on a reduction in risk-taking.  The company reported zero days of trading losses during the
first quarter of last year, the first perfect quarter in the
firm’s history. It reported 10 such days in the second quarter,
two in the third and 13 in the fourth.  The company said its trading losses exceeded the firm’s
value-at-risk limit, a measure of how much the company could
lose in the securities markets in one day, on one occasion
during the quarter. Average daily value-at-risk was $101 million
in the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
