Yields on most Brazilian interest-
rate futures contracts maturing in November or later tumbled on
speculation the central bank will cut  interest rates  to shore up
growth as the global economy slows.  Yields on the rates contract due in January 2013 plunged 14
basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 11.83 percent,
reversing a four basis-point increase earlier. Yields on the
contract due in January 2012 fell three basis points to 12.23
percent. The real surged 2.3 percent, the biggest jump since
June 2010, to 1.5890 per dollar, from 1.6263 yesterday.  Brazilian traders stepped up rate-cut bets after the
 Federal Reserve  pledged for the first time to keep the benchmark
U.S. rate at a record low at least through mid-2013 to revive
the flagging recovery after a worldwide stock rout. The Bovespa
stock index jumped 5.1 percent following yesterday’s 8.1 percent
plunge. Investors are betting Banco Central do Brasil may be
more aggressive in lowering rates than it was as the beginning
of the financial crisis in 2008, said  Solange Srour , chief
economist at BNY Mellon ARX Investimentos in Rio de Janeiro.  “The central bank received a lot of criticism that it cut
rates too late” during the 2008 crisis, Srour said in a
telephone interview. “The market has begun to price in the fact
that this time they may be more aggressive.”  Traders are boosting bets of a decrease in borrowing costs
after a U.S. credit-rating downgrade intensified concern that an
economic slowdown in  Brazil ’s second-biggest trading partner
will worsen.  Economists covering the Brazilian economy cut their 2012
inflation forecast for the first time since June, on bets that
slower growth will help curb consumer price rises. a central
bank report showed yesterday.  Consumer prices will rise 5.27 percent next year, according
to the median forecast in an Aug. 5  central bank survey  of about
100 economists published yesterday. The figure was down from a
forecast of 5.30 percent the previous week.  The prospect of an interest-rate cut spurred the Bovespa to
rally the most since October 2009, rebounding from a 27-month
low to close at 51,150.90 at the end of Sao Paulo trading at
4:15 p.m. New York time.  The real advanced as foreign investors poured money back
into the Brazilian stock market, said  Francisco Carvalho ,
currency director at Liquidez DTVM.  “The market is very volatile,” Carvalho said in a
telephone interview from Sao Paulo. “This shows that the market
is still a bit lost about what the impact of this crisis will
be.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
