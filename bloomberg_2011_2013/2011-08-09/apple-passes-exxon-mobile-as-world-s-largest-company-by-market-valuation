Apple Inc. (AAPL)  briefly passed  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)  today to become the world’s largest company by market
value, before dropping back down to second place.  The shares rose as much as 4.7 percent to $369.89 today on
the Nasdaq Stock Market, giving Apple a valuation of $342.9
billion. The stock pared those gains and was trading at $365.93
as of 1:41 p.m. New York time, with a market capitalization of
$339.1 billion. Exxon is down 40 cents to $69.79 on the New York
Stock Exchange, giving it a value of $339.4 billion.  Apple’s valuation has soared in recent years as Chief
Executive Officer Steve Jobs pushed into new markets, such as
mobile phones, tablets and music downloads. The company overtook
Nokia Oyj in smartphone shipments for the first time last
quarter, becoming the leader in that market. Apple’s iPhone,
released in 2007, is now its best-selling product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
