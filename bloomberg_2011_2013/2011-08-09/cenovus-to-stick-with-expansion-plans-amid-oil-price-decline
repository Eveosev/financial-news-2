Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) , the oil producer
spun off by Encana Corp. in 2009, is sticking with expansion
plans even after a 17 percent drop in the price of oil this
month, Chief Operating Officer John Brannan said.  “The changes in the price so far wouldn’t affect project
execution,” Brannan said in a telephone interview today. “Long
term, we expect the economy to pick up.”  Cenovus, based in Calgary, plans to spend as much as C$3.5
billion ($3.58 billion) a year on  capital investment  during the
next decade to accelerate output. The company expects oil to
average $80 a barrel this year, increasing to $85 next year,
Brannan said today, reiterating an earlier forecast.  Crude for September delivery dropped $2.01 to $79.30 on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  today, the lowest settlement since
Sept. 29. Futures prices have fallen 17 percent in August and 13
percent this year.  Cenovus is able to recover the cost of capital at its oil-
sands operations at a price of between $40 and $55 a barrel,
Brannan said.  “We’re a very low-cost operator,” he said. “Other
projects by operators that aren’t as cost effective may be
affected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
