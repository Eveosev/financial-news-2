Palm oil  slumped to the lowest in
more than nine months as the global rout in equities and crude
oil deepened on concern the loss of the U.S.’s AAA rating will
exacerbate a slowing global economy.  The October-delivery contract lost as much as 2.5 percent
to 2,920 ringgit ($959) per metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the lowest level since Oct. 20, and was at
2,930 ringgit at 10:45 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur.  Standard & Poor’s  on Aug. 5 cut the U.S. AAA rating to AA+
in response to the deal President  Barack Obama  and lawmakers
reached to raise the $14.3 trillion debt limit. Federal Reserve
policy makers will hold a one-day meeting today as the
unprecedented downgrade of the U.S.’s top credit rating fuels
speculation America is headed for a recession. Crude oil sank
below $80 a barrel in  New York , the first time since October.  “The external market weakness is spilling over to palm,”
said Ryan Long, vice president of futures and options at OSK
Investment Bank Bhd. “If the financial markets and everything
else is going down, except gold, then I think palm has got no
choice but to follow.”  Palm oil may slump to as low as 2,800 ringgit by September
as output jumps,  Dorab Mistry , director of Godrej International
Ltd., said July 28.  Output in Malaysia, the world’s second-biggest grower, may
increase to 18.3 million tons in 2011 from 17 million tons last
year, Choo Yuen May, director-general of the Malaysian Palm Oil
Board said yesterday. Prices of the tropical oil may average at
3,220 ringgit a ton in 2011, she said.  Soybeans for delivery in November lost as much as 2.3
percent to $12.82 per bushel in Chicago and last traded at
$12.87.  Soybean oil  for December delivery dropped as much as 2.4
percent to 53.15 cents per pound.  Palm oil for May delivery slumped as much as 4.2 percent to
8,464 yuan ($1,314) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange and
soybean oil for delivery in the same month dropped as much as
3.8 percent to 9,626 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
