Diamond Bank Plc (DIAMONDB) , a Nigerian lender
with operations in four other African countries, aims to boost
its loans by 25 percent to 400 billion naira ($2.6 billion) this
year, Chief Financial Officer Abdulrahman Yinusa said.  The Lagos-based lender expanded to Togo,  Ivory Coast  and
Senegal this year, after starting its first foreign unit in
Benin.  The bank doesn’t plan to open more offices outside Nigeria
this year and will focus on “where there are opportunities
within the country,” Yinusa said today in a phone interview
from Lagos, the commercial capital.  Diamond Bank’s shares fell 4.6 percent to 3.98 naira, its
lowest since Jan. 29, 2009, at the 2.30 p.m. close of trading in
Lagos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
