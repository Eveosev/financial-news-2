A tiger-hunting Rolls-Royce, a
Ferrari estimated at $13 million and a Steve McQueen motorcycle
are among the highlights of automotive auctions in  California 
next week.  The sales coincide with the Aug. 15-21  Monterey Car Week ,
the annual extravaganza that gathers rare vehicles and wealthy
owners. Auction houses Gooding & Co. and Bonhams will offer more
than 500 lots of cars, motorcycles and memorabilia.  Bragging rights may go to a Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa
prototype that’s coming on the block Aug. 20 at  Gooding  in
Pebble Beach. Its forecast price of more than $13 million would
set an auction record for an automobile.  Assembled in 1957, it competed in the Le Mans 24-hour race
as well as in endurance races in Argentina and  Venezuela . Its
curvaceous red body and a 12-cylinder engine made the Testa
Rossa the most popular Ferrari racing model in the 1950s and
1960s.  “This model won almost all races between 1957 and 1963,”
said Marcel Massini, a Swiss-based Ferrari historian, in a
telephone interview. “It’s an iconic car and an iconic
design.”  A star lot at Bonhams’s annual two-day sale in Carmel is a
red 1925 Rolls-Royce New Phantom. Custom-designed for the Bengal
tiger hunting expeditions of  India ’s Maharajah of Kotah, the
four-door convertible is powered by an 7.7-liter, 6-cylinder
engine and is expected to bring $750,000 to $1 million.  Killer Car  You could blow away the whole village along with the poor
tiger. The car was outfitted with a mounted double-barreled
shotgun, a rifle stand in the rear passenger compartment and a
machine gun on a trailer hitch. A cannon could be mounted on the
rear bumper.  “I highly doubt that anyone would go hunting with it,”
said David Swig, a motorcars specialist at Bonhams. “It’s more
of a museum piece.”  Another highlight is a 1931 Duesenberg, which is expected
to fetch as much as $7 million at Gooding, exceeding the current
$4.5 million auction record for a “Duesy.” One of the grandest
and most elegant cars of its type, it was commissioned by
Captain George Whittell Jr., who had a pet lion and a 40,000-
acre  Lake Tahoe  estate.  Whittell paid $17,000 for the car, a tiny fraction of his
fortune. He liquidated his entire stock portfolio for $50
million just two weeks before the 1929 market crash.  There’s plenty of celebrity provenance at the California
sales. Gooding offers a black 1931 Brough Superior SS80
motorcycle that once belonged to McQueen. Its estimate: $100,000
to $200,000.  Sheryl Crow  for Joplin  Fans of Sheryl Crow can bid on the singer’s 1959 Mercedes-
Benz 190 SL Roadster, expected to fetch $50,000 to $80,000. The
proceeds from the sale of this white convertible will benefit
the community of Joplin,  Missouri , following a devastating
tornado that swept through the city in May.  A 1963 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud III Drophead Coupe owned
by Sammy Davis Jr. is expected to bring $475,000 to $550,000 at
Bonhams. He and his wife, Mai Britt, appeared in a photo with
the car in the December 1964 issue of  Ebony  magazine. It has a
left-hand drive, beige leather interior and re-lacquered wood
veneers.  The two sales could tally more than $100 million.  Bonhams & Butterfields will hold its “Exceptional
Motorcars, Motorcycles and Automobilia” sale Aug. 18-19 at
Quail Lodge Golf Club, Carmel, California. Preview: Aug. 17-19.  Gooding & Co.’s “ Pebble Beach  Auctions” will take place
Aug. 20-21 at Pebble Beach Equestrian Center, Pebble Beach,
California. Preview: Aug. 17-21.  (Katya Kazakina is a reporter for Muse, the arts and
