Australian stocks fell, extending a
20 percent drop from the benchmark’s index’s April 2010 peak,
after Standard & Poor’s cut the credit rating for U.S.-sponsored
mortgage finance companies, spurring concern the ripple effects
of the loss of America’s AAA rating may worsen a global slowdown.  Billabong International Ltd. (BBG) , the world’s biggest surfwear
maker that gets almost half its sales from the Americas, dropped
6 percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company,
sank 3.4 percent after commodity prices tumbled.  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , the country’s biggest business lender,
slumped 3.6 percent even after saying third-quarter profit rose
27 percent.  “It’s pretty much become all about confidence now,” said
 James Holt , Sydney-based director of BlackRock Investment
Management (Australia) Ltd., which oversees about $40 billion.
“Absent the noise of Europe and the S&P downgrade, the U.S. was
on track for a slow and steady recovery. You’re seeing how
effectively confidence and perception is overtaking reality, and
that’s the big risk now for stock-market investors.”  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index, which last week had its
steepest weekly retreat since 2008, fell 3.9 percent to 3,830.1
as of 10:19 a.m. in Sydney. The gauge yesterday fell 20 percent
from a peak it reached on April 15, 2010. It has erased more
than half its gains from its March 6, 2009, low in the aftermath
of the global financial crisis. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost
3.3 percent to 3,081.41.  To contact the reporters on this story:
