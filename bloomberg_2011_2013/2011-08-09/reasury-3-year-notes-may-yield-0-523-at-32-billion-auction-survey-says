The Treasury Department’s $32 billion
sale of three-year notes may draw a yield of 0.523 percent,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers. It is the
first note auction since  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S. long-
term credit rating Aug. 5.  The amount was unchanged from the previous 10 sales of the
security. The notes, which mature in August 2014, yielded 0.515
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time.  Last month’s auction of three-year notes drew a yield of
0.67 percent, the lowest level since November.  The July 12 offering’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.22, versus an average of 3.15 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 34.5 percent of the notes at the
July sale, compared with 35.6 percent at the June auction. The
average for the past 10 offerings is 33.9 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 16.5 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 13.2
percent for the past 10 auctions.  Three-year notes have returned 2.9 percent this year,
compared with a gain of 6.2 percent for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  The Treasury is selling $72 billion in notes and bonds this
week. It’s due to auction $24 billion of 10-year securities
tomorrow and will sell $16 billion of 30-year debt on Aug. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
