Petrotrans Co. , a Chinese oil
exploration company, may face attack in  Ethiopia ’s restive
Ogaden region if it begins operations in the area, a U.S.-based
advocacy group said.  “We urge all foreign  oil companies , especially the Chinese
oil and gas company PetroTrans, to refrain from undertaking any
oil exploration missions in Ogaden,” the Resolve Ogaden
Coalition said in an e-mailed statement today.  Ethiopia’s mines ministry signed a deal with PetroTrans for
it to explore for deposits and develop proven reserves in the
region, the state-owned  Ethiopian News Agency  said on July 22.
Petronas Nasional Bhd sold the assets in October as part of what
it said was a “rationalization exercise.”  The Ogaden National Liberation Front has been fighting for
self-determination in the ethnic Somali region since 1984. In
April 2007, the banned rebel group attacked an exploration site
operated by  China ’s Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau,
killing nine Chinese workers and 65 Ethiopians.  “We hope PetroTrans will heed our call and advice before
another avoidable catastrophe, like the one in Obole 2007, takes
place in Ogaden due to their intransigence which puts profits
before human rights,” the coalition said today.  Ethiopian Communications Minister Bereket Simon and ONLF
spokesman Abdirahman Mahdi didn’t answer their mobiles phones
when called by Bloomberg today for comment. A call to
PetroTrans’s head office in Hong Kong outside normal business
hours wasn’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
