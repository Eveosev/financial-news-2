Swiss stocks fluctuated between gains
and losses, ending the  Swiss Market Index (SMI) ’s longest streak of
declines on record.  The SMI, a measure of the biggest and most actively traded
companies, rose 0.2 percent to 4,977.6 at 4:58 p.m. in Zurich.
The gauge entered a  bear market  on Aug. 4 and has now plummeted
26 percent from its high this year on Feb. 18 as  Europe ’s debt
crisis and the slowing global economy prompted investors to buy
the Swiss franc, reducing the value of exporters’ revenue. The
broader Swiss Performance Index fell 0.1 percent today.  The  Federal Reserve  meets today as  Standard & Poor’s 
downgrade of the U.S.’s top credit rating fueled concern that
America’s recovery will falter. Speculation has grown that
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  may do more to help restore confidence,
with Harvard University economist  Kenneth Rogoff  predicting that
the Fed will embark on a third round of bond buying, or
quantitative easing, known as QE3, to prop up growth.  “The mood is pretty dreadful,” said Jon Cox, head of
Swiss research at Kepler Capital Markets in Zurich. “Investors
aren’t willing to step in because you can probably get the
stocks cheaper tomorrow, or the day after. Those investors who
are in stocks are increasingly throwing in the towel. However,
if we see QE3, don’t bet against a big market rebound -- but we
need the announcement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
