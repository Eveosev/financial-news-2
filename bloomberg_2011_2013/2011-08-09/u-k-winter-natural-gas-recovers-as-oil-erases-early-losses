U.K. natural gas for winter delivery
rose on the back of gains in  oil prices , triggered by
speculation that a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting would increase
monetary stimulus.  Brent oil recovered after earlier having dipped below $100
a barrel for the first time since Feb. 8. Natural gas prices
have fallen 8.5 percent since April 4 when contracts rallied to
the highest this year in the wake of the earthquake in  Japan  and
the closure of nuclear power stations in  Germany .  Gas for delivery in the six months from October gained 1.3
percent, or 0.87 pence, to 69.12 pence a therm at 5:05 p.m. in
London after dropping as much as 1.1 percent, or 0.75 pence, to
67.5 pence a therm, according to broker prices compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s equal to $11.20 a million British thermal
units. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  Summer 2012 gas slipped 0.4 percent to 62.75 pence after
earlier falling as much as 1.3 percent to 62.2 pence, the lowest
since March 14.  Brent pared its losses of $5 a barrel, or 4.8 percent, to
trade at $104.72 on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at 5:05 p.m.
in London. Most of mainland Europe buys its gas on multiyear
contracts linked to the cost of crude-oil products. The price of
gas on the continent in turn affects the British price because
of pipeline connections.  Gas-Fed  Winter power gained 2 percent to 55.35 pounds a megawatt-
hour, the lowest since March 1. About half of Britain’s power
comes from natural gas-fed stations, so the price of that fuel
influences electricity markets. Baseload power is delivered
around the clock.  National Grid Plc, the operator of the nation’s pipeline
network, forecast the country’s pipelines will hold 3.2 million
cubic meters more gas at 6 a.m. tomorrow than at that time
today. Demand for the fuel is forecast at 188 million cubic
meters, 46 million below normal for the time of year.  Gas for immediate delivery gained 1 percent to 52.5 pence.
Baseload power for tomorrow was stable at 45.30 pounds a
megawatt-Hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
