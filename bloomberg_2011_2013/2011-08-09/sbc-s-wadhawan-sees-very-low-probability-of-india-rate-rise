Manish Wadhawan, Mumbai-based head of
interest-rate trading at HSBC Holdings Plc, comments on the
outlook for India’s monetary policy and government bonds as last
week’s U.S. credit-rating downgrade fuels concern the global
economic recovery is stalling.  On  interest rates :  “The probability of a rate hike from the  Reserve Bank  of
India has become very, very low. Nobody’s expecting a rate cut
in the near future but it could very well be a pause situation.”  On 10-year bonds:  “There is a lot of churn going on. People are taking
profits and then re-entering the market. We have continuous
supply from the government’s borrowing program. So I don’t think
the 10-year yield will be going below 8.10 percent in the next
15 to 20 days unless we have some sort of affirmation from the
central bank regarding rates.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
