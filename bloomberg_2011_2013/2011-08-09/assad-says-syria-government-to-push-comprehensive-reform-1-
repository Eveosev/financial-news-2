Syria  is pursuing “comprehensive
reform” and is open to help from nations that are its friends,
President Bashar al-Assad said after meeting today in the
capital, Damascus, with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, the Syrian state-run news agency Sana reported.  Turkey was planning to convey its views on Syria’s
crackdown on anti-government protesters in a “decisive” manner
to officials during today’s meeting, Turkish Prime Minister
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said Aug. 6. His country has “reached the
last stretch of patience” with its neighbor, he said.  Assad told Davutoglu that “armed terrorist groups” have
killed civilians and members of the security forces in some
Syrian cities and terrorized residents, according to Sana.  Davutoglu left Syria without making a statement, the
Turkish state-run Anatolia news agency reported. Sana said the
minister told Assad that  Turkey  seeks the security and stability
of Syria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
