Dutch sugar yields are forecast to
climb less than expected two weeks ago because of overcast
weather, industry researcher IRS said.  The average amount of sugar produced from a hectare (2.47
acres) of beets may climb 15 percent to 14.5 metric tons from
12.6 tons in 2010, less than the 14.9 tons previously forecast,
Bergen op Zoom, Netherlands-based IRS said in a  report  on its
website today.  The Netherlands is the European Union’s fifth-largest
sugar-beet grower after  France ,  Germany , the U.K. and  Poland ,
data from the bloc show. Sugar production per hectare is still
expected to be at a record level after warm weather in April and
May boosted beet development, according to IRS.  “Due to the somber conditions of the past month the yield
expectation has declined,” IRS said. “Little sun means little
photosynthesis and therefore low sugar production.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
