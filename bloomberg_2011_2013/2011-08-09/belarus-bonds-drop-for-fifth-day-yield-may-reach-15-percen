Belarus’s bonds fell for a fifth day,
increasing the yield to 13.2 percent, as investors reduced
holdings of assets considered higher risk.  The yield on the country’s $1 billion of 2015 bonds has
risen 156 basis points, or 1.56 percentage points, since Aug. 2,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “In the context of further market weakness we could see
those bonds go to 14 to 15 percent yield,” said Ronald Solberg,
head of fixed-income reasearch at Otkritie Capital in  London .
The bonds may rally when the selloff in global markets ends.  The bonds had been gaining earlier this month after the
government paid interest of $43.8 million on its notes on Aug.
