The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars rose as stocks rallied after the  Federal Reserve  pledged
to keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low at least
through mid-2013 to support the recovery.  The Aussie dropped earlier below parity with the U.S.
currency for the first time since March on concern the world’s
largest economy is slowing and the euro region’s sovereign-debt
crisis is getting worse. The South Pacific nations’ currencies
slid immediately after the Fed’s statement as stocks fell.  “If we can close on a good note, the bottom may be in for
risky assets,” said  Greg Anderson , a senior currency strategist
at Citigroup Inc. in New York. “If that’s the case, currencies
like the Aussie should take off here.”  Australia ’s dollar advanced 1.5 percent to $1.0336 at 3:50
p.m. in New York, from $1.0187 yesterday. It earlier fell to
99.28 U.S. cents. New Zealand’s dollar appreciated 1.6 percent
to 83.42 U.S. cents after weakening to as low as 79.66 U.S.
cents, the lowest level since May 25.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  discussed a range of
policy tools to bolster the economy and said it’s “prepared to
employ these tools as appropriate,” it said in a statement
today in Washington. Three members of the FOMC dissented,
preferring to maintain the pledge to keep rates low for an
“extended period.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 3.7 percent after
falling 1.6 percent immediately after the Fed’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
