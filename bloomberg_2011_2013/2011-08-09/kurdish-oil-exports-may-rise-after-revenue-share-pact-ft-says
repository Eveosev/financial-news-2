Iraq ’s central government may reach
an agreement with the Kurdistan regional government by the end
of the year guaranteeing Kurdistan about 17 percent of the
country’s total oil revenue, the Financial Times reported,
citing an official at Kurdistan’s oil ministry who asked not to
be identified.  That official described an agreement negotiated in
February, under which Kurdistan receives half of the revenue
from the oil it exports, as a “confidence-building measure,”
the newspaper said.  A revenue-sharing agreement may lead to an increase in oil
exports from Kurdistan to 1 million barrels a day by 2015, the
FT said.  Kurdistan has about 45 million barrels of oil and between
100 trillion and 200 trillion cubic feet of gas, according to
estimates by Ashti Hawrami, the natural resources minister in
the Kurdistan regional government, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
