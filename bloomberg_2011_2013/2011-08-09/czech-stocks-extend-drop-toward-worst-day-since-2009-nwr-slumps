The Czech Republicâ€™s main stock index
extended losses, headed for its biggest drop in 2 1/2 years, as
New World Resources Plc and  Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV)  tumbled more than 14 percent.  The PX gauge of 14 companies slumped 6.6 percent to 959.8
by 10:30 a.m. in Prague. A close at that level would mark the
biggest one-day retreat since February 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
