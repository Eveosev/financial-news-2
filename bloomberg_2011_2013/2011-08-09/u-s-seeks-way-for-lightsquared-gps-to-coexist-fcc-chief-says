Regulators are trying to find ways
for Philip Falcone’s LightSquared wireless service to co-exist
with global-positioning system users who have complained of
potential interference, Federal Communications Commission
Chairman  Julius Genachowski  said.  “We’re not going to do anything that creates problems for
GPS safety and service as we explore technical solutions that
will both protect GPS and allow a new service to launch,”
Genachowski said at a news conference today after the agency’s
monthly meeting in Washington.  The FCC is considering whether to grant final approval to
LightSquared, which plans a wholesale network for 260 million
subscribers using airwaves previously reserved mainly for
satellites. Makers and users of GPS devices, which use satellite
signals, say LightSquared would disrupt navigation equipment on
aircraft, boats, tractors and automobiles.  The agency is conducting “an engineering, fact-based
process,” Genachowski said.  The FCC is taking comments until Aug. 15 on LightSquared’s
proposal to lessen interference by initially limiting operations
to part of its allocated airwaves. The agency hasn’t set a
deadline for its decision, and is considering whether more
testing may be needed, Julius Knapp, chief of the agency’s
technology office, said in a briefing for reporters today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
