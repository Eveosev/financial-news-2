Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the largest
U.S. lender, won’t need to raise extra capital to meet new
international standards, Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson
told Nomura Securities International analysts.  The bank will be able to comply by cutting expenses,
selling assets and letting some holdings decline naturally as
they mature by the time the rules become fully effective,
Thompson said in a meeting with analysts led by Glenn Schorr in
New York. The largest global banks are required to set aside
extra funds under rules from the  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision  that will be phased in between 2013 and 2019.  ``Bruce reiterated they do not see a need to raise capital
and remain focused on building capital at an accelerated pace
through risk-weighted asset mitigation and freeing up restricted
capital components,’’ Schorr wrote in a note to clients today.  While Schorr prefers New York lenders  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  to Bank of America, he said the 20 percent
plunge in shares of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company
yesterday “seems overdone as the bank still has solid consumer
and capital markets franchises and a much-improved balance sheet
versus 2008.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
