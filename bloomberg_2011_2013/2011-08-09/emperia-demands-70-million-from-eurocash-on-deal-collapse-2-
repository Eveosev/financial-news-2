Emperia Holding SA (EMP) , a Polish food
distribution and retail network, withdrew from an agreement to
sell its units and demanded 200 million zloty ($70 million) in
compensation after potential buyer  Eurocash SA (EUR)  failed to
complete the deal on time.  Shares in Eurocash, Poland’s largest food and household-
products wholesaler, posted their biggest decline ever, falling
23 percent to 18.53 zloty. The shares pared the decline and were
down 6.2 percent at 2:48 p.m. in Warsaw. Emperia fell 12.6
percent to 85.7 zloty, underperforming the benchmark WIG20
Index, which lost 2.1 percent.  Eurocash is expanding the wholesale business in an attempt
to help local retail shops help fend off competition from
discount chains, including Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA’s Biedronka,
 Poland ’s biggest retailer.  Komorniki, western Poland-based Eurocash said in a
regulatory statement today that there are “no grounds” for the
claim and it’s continuing to carry out the acquisition
agreement.  In January Emperia agreed to sell its wholesale business
and part of its retail chain to Eurocash for 926 million zloty.
The transaction hasn’t been completed yet as Eurocash is
awaiting the Polish antitrust regulator’s approval. Emperia said
today it wants the compensation as the buyer failed to pay the
price by a July 15 deadline.  Eurocash Chief Executive Officer Luis Amaral expects a
“positive” decision by the watchdog by the end of August and
will be ready to complete the deal then, he said in a phone
interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
