OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel,  Russia â€™s
biggest mining company, slid to an eight-month low in Moscow
trading as copper prices declined.  Norilsk slumped 2.9 percent to 6,500 rubles as of 6:45 p.m.
local time, the lowest closing price since Dec. 8.  Copper for three-month delivery fell as much as 3.8 percent
to $8,446.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange. Nickel
reversed an earlier loss, while zinc gained.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
