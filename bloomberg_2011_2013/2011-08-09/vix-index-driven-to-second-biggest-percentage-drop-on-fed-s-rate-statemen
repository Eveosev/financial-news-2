The VIX had the second-largest
percent drop ever, reversing yesterday’s biggest surge in four
years, after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  promised
to keep interest rates at record lows to revive economic growth.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, slumped 27 percent to 35.06 at 4:15 p.m. in  New
York , paring yesterday’s 50 percent surge to 48, the highest
level since March 2009. The only larger drop in its 21-year
history was a 30 percent slide on May 10, 2010, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The VIX measures the cost of options
on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which surged 4.7 percent.  The Fed pledged for the first time to keep its benchmark
 interest rate  at a record low at least through mid-2013 in a bid
to revive a recovery that’s “considerably slower” than
anticipated. The  Federal Open Market Committee  discussed a range
of policy tools to bolster the economy and said it is “prepared
to employ these tools as appropriate,” it said in a statement.
The  S&P 500  had fallen 11 percent over the previous three days
after S&P cut the U.S.’s credit rating and amid concern the
world’s largest economy might slip into recession.  VIX futures expiring this month fell 17 percent to 30.50.
September contracts lost 16 percent to 25.35. The volatility
index and gauge of expected S&P 500 price swings over the next
30 days has averaged 20.35 over its 21-year history.  To contact the reporters on this story:
