Oil rebounded from a 10-month low in
 New York  on signs of shrinking U.S. crude inventories and after
the  Federal Reserve  said it may to use a range of methods to
bolster the economy.  Futures gained for the first time in three days after the
Fed said yesterday it will keep  interest rates  near zero until
mid-2013 and use other tools “as appropriate.” Crude supplies
fell the most since June, according to the industry-funded
American Petroleum Institute. The  International Energy Agency 
said it may need to cut next year’s estimate for oil demand.  “Brent and WTI have made strong gains this morning on the
back of brighter sentiment on markets after the Federal
Reserve’s decision not to raise the federal funds rate until
mid-2013,” said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst in Frankfurt at
Commerzbank AG, the third most-accurate forecaster of  oil prices 
in the second quarter.  Crude for September delivery advanced as much as $3.60, or
4.54 percent, to $82.90 a barrel in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , and was at $82.12 at 1:17 p.m.
London time. The contract yesterday fell $2.01, or 2.5 percent,
to $79.30, the lowest settlement since Sept. 29. Prices are down
10 percent this year.  Brent oil for September settlement gained $3.66, or 3.6
percent, to $106.23 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract was at a
premium of $24.11 to U.S. futures, having reached a record of
$24.23 earlier.  IEA Projections  Brent crude oil may fall to $80 a barrel in a “mild”
recession, a price that would prompt the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce supply, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch said in a report dated yesterday.  The IEA said threats to global economic recovery may cut
oil demand growth next year by more than 60 percent, while
keeping underlying forecasts for 2011 and 2012 little changed.  The Paris-based agency, which advises 28 industrialized
nations on  energy policy , trimmed demand forecasts for 2011 by
60,000 barrels a day as fuel costs weigh on consumers, and
raised projections for next year by 70,000 a day to 91.1 million
on growth in  Japan . The IEA expects global oil consumption will
increase 1.6 million barrels a day, or 1.8 percent, in 2012. It
may expand by less than half that amount if worldwide growth
misses expectations, it said.  “It looks like markets want to turn back up,”  Peter Beutel , president of Cameron Hanover Inc., an energy adviser in
 New Canaan , Connecticut, said in an e-mailed note. Traders
bought oil after the settlement and “prices were back in
positive numbers after the API report, which showed inventory
drawdowns across the board,” he said.  U.S. Supplies  U.S. crude-oil supplies declined 5.21 million barrels to
348.6 million last week, the  American Petroleum Institute  said.
An Energy Department report today may show stockpiles increased
1.35 million barrels in the seven days ended Aug. 5, according
to the median estimate of 12 analysts and traders in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Gasoline inventories decreased 1.01 million barrels to
211.2 million barrels, the API data show. The Energy Department
report will probably show they rose 900,000 barrels, according
to the Bloomberg News survey.  The API collects stockpile data on a voluntary basis from
operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed for its weekly survey.
Oil-supply totals from the API and the department have moved in
the same direction 71 percent of the time in the past year and
75 percent in the past four years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
