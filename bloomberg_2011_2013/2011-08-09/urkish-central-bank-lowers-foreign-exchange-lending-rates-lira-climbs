The central bank cut the lending rate
to banks for dollar and euro deposits to help boost liquidity in 
the foreign exchange market. The lira gained.  The central bank lowered the lending rate in dollars to 4.5
percent from 5.5 percent and the rate in euros to 5.5 percent
from 6.5 percent, according to an e-mailed statement today.  “Developments in the foreign exchange market will be
watched closely and measures that are needed will be taken in a
timely fashion,” the central bank said.  The lira rose 0.6 percent to 1.7716 per dollar at 9:54
a.m., erasing earlier declines. It pared losses against the
euro, falling 0.1 percent o 2.5289.  To contact the reporter on this story:
