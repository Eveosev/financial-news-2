Hong Kong  may have fund outflows as
“ risk aversion  sentiment” among investors increases, the
city’s de facto central bank said today.  “The Hong Kong banking system is robust and our banks are
well-capitalised,” Hong Kong Monetary Authority said in a
statement. “Our financial system is resilient and able to cope
with market volatilities.”  The city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  has slid more than 20
percent from a November high as a report showing Chinese
inflation accelerated added to concern the global economic
slowdown may worsen in the wake of the U.S. credit-rating
downgrade.  The Hang Seng Index tumbled 7.2 percent to 19,013.75 as of
10:14 a.m. local time, falling 24 percent from its closing high
on Nov. 8, a level that some investors define as a  bear market .  Investors should “continue to be calm and vigilant,” the
monetary authority said.  The Hong Kong dollar, which trades in a range of HK$7.75 to
HK$7.85 versus the greenback, dropped to HK$7.8107, the weakest
level since August 2008, as of 10:12 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
