(Corrects yuan forwards level in third paragraph)  China  is done raising  interest rates 
and will rein in yuan appreciation, based on trading in
derivatives contracts.  Two-year swap contracts based on the one-year deposit rate
reflect expectations there will be no adjustments in the central
bank’s benchmark in the coming 12 months, after five rises since
September. The swap fell 10 basis points, 0r 0.10 percentage
point, to 3.50 percent as of 10:27 a.m. in  Shanghai . That’s the
first time since May 2009 that the contracts haven’t reflected
bets for an increase.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards for the yuan weakened
0.6 percent to 6.4180 per dollar in  Hong Kong , a 0.4 percent
premium to the onshore spot rate of 6.4423. That’s the smallest
gap since August 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
