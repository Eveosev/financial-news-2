Poland’s benchmark stock index
tumbled 20 percent from this year’s high, entering a so-called
 bear market , as oil refiners and power utilities slumped on
concern that the global economy is slowing.  The WIG20 Index declined as much as 1.7 percent on the day
to 2,350.48 and was 1 percent lower at 2,368.17 at 10:09 a.m. in
Warsaw. It was the seventh day of losses, the longest run of
daily drops since January 2009. The gauge hit a high of 2,942.39
on April 8.  PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s largest oil refiner, sank 2.4
percent to 37.85 zloty, heading for the lowest close in a year
and  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) , the second-biggest refiner, slumped 3.5
percent to 32.33 zloty. Oil fell to the lowest in more than 10
months in  New York  and dipped below $100 a barrel in  London  as
the U.S. credit-rating cut and rising stockpiles stoked concern
a slowing economy will reduce demand for fuel.  PGE SA, Poland’s biggest power producer, slid 2.1 percent
to 19.66 zloty, and was poised to close at the lowest level
since stock started trading in 2009.  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE) ,
the second-largest utility, slumped 5.6 percent to 5.21 zloty,
falling for a fifth day.  Bank Handlowy SA, Citigroup Inc.’s Polish unit, declined
2.5 percent to 73.3 zloty, heading toward the lowest close in
more than a year, after reporting second-quarter earnings that
missed analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
