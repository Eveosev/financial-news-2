(Corrects to remove reference to record loss in first
paragraph for story dated Aug. 9.)  China Cosco Holdings Co., the world’s
largest operator of dry-bulk ships, said it probably posted a
loss for the first half of the year as rising fuel costs eroded
profits.  China Cosco, based in Tianjin municipality, said the loss
was caused by the “prolonged high fuel price under the
declining international freight market,” according to a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today. First-half
profit was 3.45 billion yuan ($540 million) last year, it said.  Fuel prices advanced 28 percent this year through yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nippon Yusen K.K. and
Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd.,  Japan ’s two largest shipping lines,
slashed their annual profit forecasts last month amid falling
rates and rising fuel costs.  Container-shipping rates have fallen on Asia-U.S. and Asia-
Europe routes as the global fleet expands and demand cools. The
global fleet of dry-bulk carriers will also grow 13 percent this
year, outpacing a 4 percent increase in traffic, according to
Clarkson Research Services Ltd., a unit of the world’s largest
shipbroker.  The Baltic Dry Index, a benchmark for commodity-shipping
rates, dropped 0.3 percent to 1,264 yesterday, extending its
loss to 25 percent this year.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Tan Hwee Ann  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
