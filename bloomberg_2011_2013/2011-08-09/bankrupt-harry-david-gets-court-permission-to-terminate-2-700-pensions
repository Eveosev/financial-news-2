Harry & David Holdings Inc., a
specialty-food retailer, received  bankruptcy court  permission to
terminate the pensions of more than 2,700 workers, the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp. said.  PBGC said in a statement today that it had told the court
that Harry & David could afford to keep the plan and that the
company was terminating it largely to increase investors’
returns, not out of necessity to emerge from bankruptcy.  “We’ve fought hard to get Harry & David to keep their
pensions going,” PBGC Director Josh Gotbaum said in the
statement. “Unfortunately, they decided not to, and the judge
supported them.”  In May, the Medford, Oregon-based company filed papers in
bankruptcy court seeking a so-called distress termination of the
 pension plan , saying it was under-funded by $23.6 million.
Without termination, the company said that proposed investors
wouldn’t provide $155 million needed to implement the Chapter 11
reorganization plan.  Stephanie Pillersdorf , a spokeswoman for Harry & David with
outside public relations firm Sard Verbinnen & Co. in New York,
didn’t immediately return a call to her office after regular
business hours seeking comment on the pension termination.  The case is In re Harry & David Holdings, Inc., 11-10884,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
