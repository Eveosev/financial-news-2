Ghana ’s cedi headed for the lowest in
more than four months after an oil and gas company that operates
in the West African nation bought dollars, according to the
local unit of Nigerian lender Access Bank Plc.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
weakened as much as 0.3 percent to 1.5221 per dollar as of 12:28
p.m. in Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A close at that level would be the weakest since
March 30.  “An oil and gas company bought the dollars to bring in
crude,” Biggles Amponsah, a currency trader with Access Bank
Ghana Ltd., said in a telephone interview today, declining to
identify the company. “Their demand is very huge, any time they
come on the market.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
