Bank Handlowy SA, the Polish unit of
 Citigroup Inc. (C) , said second-quarter profit dropped 24 percent as
revenue from retail loans declined and costs increased.  Net income fell to 151.4 million zloty ($52.8 million),
from 198.4 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank
said in a regulatory statement today. That missed the 187.2
million-zloty mean estimate of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Net interest income dropped 7 percent to 348.1 million
zloty as revenue from personal loans and debt securities held
for trading declined, the bank said. Costs rose 5 percent to
353.5 million zloty in the quarter.  Handlowy’s provisions for bad loans fell 83 percent to 15.4
million zloty. The bank’s solvency ratio dropped by 0.85
percentage points to 17.96 percent.  Handlowy’s first-half profit fell 4.8 percent to 332.6
million zloty from a year earlier. The combined net income of
Polish banks rose 44 percent to 7.85 billion zloty in the first
six months of the year as the industry benefited from an economy
that is expected to grow by about 4 percent this year and next,
according to government estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
