Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said the changes to the European rescue fund agreed to
at a July 21 summit need to be implemented quickly and  Italy 
must take the necessary steps on its planned reforms,
 Luxemburger Wort  reported, citing an interview.  “What’s important for the euro zone is a fast and
consistent implementation of the July 21 agreement,” Juncker,
who also leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said in
a telephone interview yesterday from his vacation, according to
the newspaper. “Italy should implement the planned reforms for
2013 and 2014.”  On the stock-market declines yesterday, Juncker said “it
could have been worse,” according to the interview published
today. “I am more or less satisfied,” he told the newspaper.  “The euro is a solid currency,” Juncker said to the Wort.
“We are not facing a crisis of the euro but a debt crisis in
some member states of the euro zone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
