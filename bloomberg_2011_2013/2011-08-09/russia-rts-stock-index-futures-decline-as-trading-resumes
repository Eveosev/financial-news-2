Russia ’s RTS stock-index futures
rose, ending a six-day decline and tracking a rebound in U.S.
stocks after the  Federal Reserve  pledged to keep its benchmark
 interest rate  at a record low at least through mid-2013.  Futures on the dollar-denominated index expiring in
September climbed 1.1 percent yesterday after falling in the
previous day to the lowest since the contract started trading
Feb. 9.  U.S. stocks jumped the most since March 2009 after the Fed
vowed to keep interest rates near zero through mid-2013 in a
statement today. The Fed also said it is prepared to use a range
of other tools “as appropriate” to bolster the economy. The
statement fueled speculation the central bank may consider a
third round of bond purchases to revive a recovery.  “The sentiment in the U.S. and developed markets will be
reflected in the broader emerging markets” including the
Russian stock market, Tom Furda, director of Russian Equity
Sales at Auerbach Grayson & Co., said in a phone interview.  Futures on OAO Gazprom, the world’s largest gas producer,
