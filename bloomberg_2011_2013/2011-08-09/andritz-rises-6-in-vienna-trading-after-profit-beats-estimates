Andritz AG (ANDR) , the world’s second-
biggest builder of hydropower plants, rose the most in more than
2 1/2 years after second-quarter profit beat estimates, driven
by the hydro division and pulp and paper sales.  Andritz rose 11 percent, the most since Nov. 7, 2008, to
close at 60.90 euros in Vienna trading, making it the biggest
gainer in the Bloomberg Europe Machinery Index. Second-quarter
net income surged 34 percent to 51.5 million euros and the order
book grew by 35 percent to 7.2 billion euros, the Graz, Austria-
based company said today.  Analysts had expected the company to report a 43.8 million-
euro profit, according to the average of six estimates collected
by Bloomberg.  France ’s  Alstom SA (ALO)  is the world’s biggest maker of
hydropower plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
