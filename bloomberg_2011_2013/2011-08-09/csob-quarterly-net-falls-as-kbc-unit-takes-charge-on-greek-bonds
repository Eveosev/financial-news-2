Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka AS, the
Czech unit of  KBC Groep NV (KBC) , said second-quarter profit declined
after the lender took a charge on Greek bonds.             Net
income from three months ended March 31 was 2.4 billion koruna
($141.4 million) compared with 3.3 billion koruna a year ago,
the Prague-based lender said in an e-mailed statement today. Net
interest income was 8.2 billion koruna compared with 8 billion
koruna in the year-ago period, fueled by rising mortgage volumes
and retail deposits.  “The result was negatively affected by the one-off
impairment on Greek bonds,” Chief Executive Officer Pavel Kavanek said in the statement. “Profit from recurring business
shows positive dynamics year on year.”  The impairment of Greek bonds, which was valued at 1.306
billion koruna, cut first-half net income 1.1 billion koruna,
the lender said in a separate statement today. Non-performing
loans totaled 4 percent of gross loans as of June 30, the bank
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
