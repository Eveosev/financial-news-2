Newly promoted Serie A club Atalanta
received a six-point deduction and two of its players were
suspended for alleged match-fixing, the Italian soccer
federation said on its website.  Atalanta captain Cristiano Doni, 38, was banned for 3 Â½
years and defender Thomas Manfredini, 31, for three years after
an investigation into players in three professional leagues
involved in match-fixing. The two were among 10 people receiving
bans from one to four years.  Former Italy national team striker Giuseppe Signori, who is
now retired, was also among seven people receiving life-time
suspensions from all soccer activities, as was goalkeeper Marco
Paoloni, who played last season with Cremonese and Benevento,
the  federation said .  Benevento also received a 9-point deduction and Ascoli was
docked 6 points. Seventeen teams were fined, docked points or
both.  To contact the reporters on this story:
