Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and
Italy’s  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  will part fund an 80 million euro
($114 million) loan to Serbia’s  MK Group  arranged with the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the EBRD said.  The funds will be used by Serbia’s leading agribusiness
operator to extend its debt repayments, provide a group member
with working capital, and to improve energy efficiency at its
sugar producing arm, the EBRD said today in a statement.  The loan is for five years, with the exception of the
credit to MK’s sugar refinery, which will be able to repay the
debt in seven years, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
