Laszlo Birinyi, one of the first
investors to recommend buying when the bull market began in
2009, said the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index will continue its
ascent, though possibly not to the level he had predicted.  “The bull market is intact, and while our ‘target’ of
1,450 in mid-2012 is admittedly a bit shaky, our more important
conclusion that a rational, disciplined portfolio can attain a
10 percent plus return in 2011 is not,” Birinyi, of Westport,
Connecticut-based research firm Birinyi Associates Inc., wrote
in a note today.  The S&P 500 has plunged in 10 of the past 11 days, wiping
out almost $3 trillion in market value, as a political battle
over the U.S. debt ceiling prompted Standard & Poor’s to cut the
country’s debt rating. Birinyi said there’s no fundamental
reason for the slide, and equities will continue the rally that
took the  S&P 500  69 percent higher since March 2009.  “The decline is, we submit, in large part political, not
financial, which makes us somewhat more optimistic,” Birinyi
wrote. “It is impossible to segregate the political from the
financial but we would hope that at some point, financial trumps
political, which has historically been the case.”  The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities climbed 2.1 percent
to 1,142.37 at 1:33 p.m. today in New York. That curbed losses
since July 22 to 15 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Equity strategists estimate the S&P 500 will climb to 1,389 by
the end of the year, according to the average forecast in a
Bloomberg survey.  Unlikely to Gain  Birinyi said financial companies and banks, commodity
stocks and health-care companies are unlikely to outperform as
the rally continues. Financial companies historically are
underperformers after the first part of a  bull market  and
dividend-paying stocks, such as pharmaceutical companies, aren’t
necessarily a good investment, Birinyi said.  Dividend investing is “an excellent strategy for the
current environment,” Oppenheimer & Co.’s New York-based chief
investment strategist,  Brian Belski , wrote in an Aug. 8 note.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. recommend today that investors buy General
Electric Co. and Johnson & Johnson for their dividend yields.  Energy and financial shares and are two of the three worst
performing groups in the S&P 500 since July 22, losing more than
18 percent.  “Despite our stance, we are not necessarily excited about
the prospects for the indices,” Birinyi said. “Our preference
continues to be for individual discrete names which may have few
common characteristics.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
