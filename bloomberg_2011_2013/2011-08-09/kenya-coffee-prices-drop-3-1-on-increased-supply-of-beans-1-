Kenyan coffee prices fell 3.1 percent
at an auction today as supplies of the beans increased, the
Nairobi Coffee Exchange said today.  Prices dropped to an average of $335.58 for a 50-kilogram
(110-pound) bag as sales rose 9.5 percent to 8,818 bags worth
$3.61 million, the exchange said in an e-mailed statement from
Nairobi, the capital. The benchmark AA grade dropped 2.8 percent
to an average of $478.75 as supplies climbed 5.6 percent to 814
bags, it said.  Supplies of the beans rose 29.2 percent to 19,210 bags from
14,872 bags at the previous sale as warmer conditions favor
drying of the beans, the exchange said.  The country harvests the bulk of its crop from October
through December, while a secondary crop is reaped from April to
June. The following are details of todayâ€™s auction in U.S.
