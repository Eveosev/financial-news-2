The Australian dollar dropped below
parity with the U.S. currency for the first time in five months
as prices tumbled for stocks and commodities amid concern fiscal
crises in the U.S. and  Europe  will slow global growth.  The currency slid for a ninth day, the longest losing
streak since exchange controls ended in 1983, as traders bet the
central bank will cut the developed world’s highest benchmark
rate 178 basis points over 12 months, according to a Credit
Suisse Group AG index. The Aussie is this month’s worst
performer against the greenback among 16 major counterparts.  Australia’s dollar fell as low as 99.99 U.S. cents before
trading at $1.0016 as of 11:47 a.m. in Sydney from $1.0187 in
 New York  yesterday. It has dropped 9.8 percent since reaching a
post-float record of $1.1081 on July 27. The currency
depreciated to 77.32 yen from 79.22 yen yesterday.  The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of  raw materials  has
plunged 7.1 percent in August, headed for its worst month since
May 2010. The MSCI World Index of equities dropped 14 percent
since July 29, extending three straight months of declines.  Raw materials including  iron ore  and coal account for a
majority of exports from Australia.  Benchmark rates are 4.75 percent in Australia, compared
with as low as zero in the U.S. and  Japan , attracting investors
to the South Pacific nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk
in such trades is that currency market moves will erase profits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
