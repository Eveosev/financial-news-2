Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the East
African nation’s largest lender by assets, said it received a
$105 million, seven-year loan from the  International Finance
Corp.   The funds will be used to lend to small business and for
mortgages, Chief Executive Officer Martin Oduor-Otieno told
reporters today in Nairobi, the capital. KCB has units in
Tanzania,  Uganda , South Sudan and Rwanda.  “The need for mortgages and housing in this region remains
very high,” he said. “We have hardly scratched the surface.”  Kenya Commercial’s first-half profit grew 41 percent to
4.06 billion shillings ($43 million), it reported on July 28.
Net interest income, the money banks earn from interest charges
on loans, increased 20 percent to 10.5 billion shillings, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
