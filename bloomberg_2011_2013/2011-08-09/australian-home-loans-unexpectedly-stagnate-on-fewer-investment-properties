Australian home-loan approvals
unexpectedly stagnated in June as buyers sought fewer properties
for investment.  The number of loans granted to build or buy houses and
apartments was unchanged from May, when they rose a revised 2.8
percent, less than previously reported, the statistics bureau
said in Sydney today. That compares with the median estimate for
approvals to rise 0.8 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 18
economists.  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  Governor  Glenn Stevens  last week
held the developed world’s highest rates at 4.75 percent after
boosting borrowing costs seven times from October 2009 to
November. Australian stocks today plunged the most in almost
three years, extending a 20 percent drop from the benchmark
index’s April 2010 peak, as concerns mounted that the loss of
the U.S. AAA credit rating may worsen a global slowdown.  “While today’s data shows total housing finance remains
soft, recent history shows financial market volatility should
bode well for housing finance,” said David Cannington, an
economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “A
downward bias to  mortgage rates  should provide a moderate boost
to current weakness in housing market sentiment.”  The Australian dollar maintained earlier declines after the
report. The so-called Aussie traded at $1.0058 as of 1:44 p.m.
in Sydney, from $1.0095 before the report and $1.0187 yesterday
in  New York .  Falling Values  The total value of loans fell 1.4 percent to A$20.2 billion
($20.3 billion) in June, today’s report showed.  The value of lending to owner-occupiers was unchanged, the
report showed. The value of loans to investors who plan to rent
or resell homes dropped 4.4 percent.  First-home buyers accounted for 15.2 percent of dwellings
that were financed in June, down from 15.4 percent in May and
lower than 16.2 percent a year earlier, the report showed today.  Australia’s labor market lost 5,400 jobs in the April-June
period, the weakest quarter since 2001. Sales of newly built
dwellings fell 8.7 percent in June, the biggest decline in five
years, a private report showed Aug. 1.  A day later, a government report showed  house prices  fell 1
percent in Perth and dropped 1.6 percent in Darwin from the
previous quarter, while they advanced 0.4 percent in Sydney and
gained 1.1 percent in Canberra. In  Melbourne , prices slipped 0.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
