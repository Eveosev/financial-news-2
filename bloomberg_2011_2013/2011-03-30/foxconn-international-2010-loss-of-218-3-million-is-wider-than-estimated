Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. (2038) ,
the Hong Kong-listed unit of the Foxconn Technology Group,
posted a full-year net loss that was wider than analysts
estimated as costs increased and sales shrank. The shares fell.  The net loss was $218.3 million, or 3.06 cents a share,
compared with net income of $38.6 million, or 0.55 cent, in 2009,
Foxconn said in a  Hong Kong  stock exchange filing yesterday. The
mean estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
net loss of $202 million.  The stock fell 5.5 percent to HK$4.62 at 11:10 a.m. in Hong
Kong, headed for its lowest close in almost two years. The
benchmark  Hang Seng Index  climbed 0.2 percent.  Foxconn Group increased salaries last year after a spate of
suicides prompted clients to investigate working conditions, and
is expanding in  China ’s interior, where costs are lower. The
Hong Kong-listed unit is selling its Taiyuan, China, unit to its
parent to help reduce fixed costs.  “We need to take decisive actions to conclude our capacity
relocation, optimize our cost structure and return to
profitability,” Foxconn said today.  Sales at Foxconn International fell to $6.63 billion from
$7.21 billion in 2009, according to the statement. The company
didn’t recommend payment of a dividend.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
