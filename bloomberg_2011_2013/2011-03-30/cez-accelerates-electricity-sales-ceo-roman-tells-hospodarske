CEZ AS (CEZ) , the Czech Republic’s
largest power producer, has accelerated sales of electricity
following  Germany ’s decision to temporarily shut down seven of
its oldest nuclear plants,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing
Chief Executive Officer Martin Roman.  Germany won’t be able to substitute power from the nuclear
plants with renewable sources like wind because they are less
reliable, the newspaper said.  Coal and gas are the only alternatives for nuclear power,
Roman told Hospodarske.  To contact the reporter on this story:
