CPFL Energia SA (CPFE3) , a Brazilian power
company, will invest 600 million reais ($368 million) to build
five wind farms in the countryâ€™s northern state  Rio Grande  do
Norte.  The projects will have a combined capacity of 150 megawatts
and are expected to go into operation in late 2013, according to
a March 28 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Construction is set to begin in the third quarter.   CPFL said in the filing it plans to sell electricity
generated by the projects on the so-called free market, and not
through government-sponsored auctions for power contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
