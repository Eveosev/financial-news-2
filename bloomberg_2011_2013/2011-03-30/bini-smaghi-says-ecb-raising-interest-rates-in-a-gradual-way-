European Central Bank Lorenzo  Bini Smaghi  said the central bank is seeking to raise interest rates
gradually in a signal officials will go ahead with lifting
borrowing costs next week.  “We are raising interest rates in a gradual way, first,”
Bini Smaghi in an interview with Russian state-run English-
language television channel RT today. “Maintaining interest
rates where they are now would mean basically becoming more and
more expansionary, which is not appropriate.”  ECB officials, including President  Jean-Claude Trichet  and
executive board member Juergen Stark, have indicated that the
economic uncertainty caused by  Japan ’s earthquake and  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis won’t deter them from raising interest
rates on April 7. Policy makers are concerned faster growth and
rising prices will prompt so-called second-round effects, where
workers demand pay raises to be compensated for higher costs.  Bini Smaghi’s colleague,  Juergen Stark , wrote today in an
article for the Financial Times that the Frankfurt-based ECB
needs to reverse the interest-rate stance it took during the
financial crisis, and it doesn’t tailor monetary policy based on
developments in individual countries.  “We have only one interest rate, so it has to go for
everybody,” Bini Smaghi said. “But we have also ways of
providing liquidity to the system that ensure that all the banks
in the system would have access to that financing, while without
this kind of access some banks would be cut out of the market.
So, we are certainly helping even the countries in the euro area
which have more difficulties.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
