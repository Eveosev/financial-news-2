Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)  expects computer
sales to be affected by the Japan earthquake,  Handelsblatt  said,
citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing.  The situation in Japan will delay the merger of Lenovo’s
Japanese unit with  NEC Corp. (6701) ’s personal computer division, and
deliveries could be held up as parts from Japanese suppliers
don’t arrive on schedule, the German newspaper cited the CEO as
saying in a release previewing tomorrow’s edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
