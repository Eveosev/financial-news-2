Medtronic Inc. (MDT) , the world’s largest
maker of heart devices, won a lawsuit it filed to prove it
wasn’t violating patents controlled by Boston Scientific Corp.  U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson in Wilmington, Delaware,
said today that Medtronic implantable defibrillators, including
the InSync, Concerto and Consulta brands, weren’t infringing two
patents owned by Mirowski Family Ventures LLC and licensed to
Boston Scientific. She upheld the validity of the patents.  Chris Garland, a spokesman for Minneapolis-based Medtronic,
said the company is pleased with the decision. Officials with
Natick, Massachusetts-based Boston Scientific, the second-
largest heart-device maker, didn’t immediately return messages
seeking comment.  The dispute was over devices to correct a defect in which
the heart ventricles contract at different times, which can lead
to heart failure. The patents, which expired in 2009, are for a
way to use electrodes to simultaneously stimulate the
ventricles, according to the judge’s opinion.  Medtronic filed the lawsuit in 2007.  The case is Medtronic Inc. v. Boston Scientific Corp.,
07cv823, U.S. District Court for the District of  Delaware 
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
