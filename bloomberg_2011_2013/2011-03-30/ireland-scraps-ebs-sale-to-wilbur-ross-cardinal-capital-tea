Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  dropped the sale of state-owned EBS Building Society to a
group including U.S. billionaire  Wilbur Ross ’s leveraged buyout
firm and Cardinal Capital Group.  “The bid was not sufficiently commercially attractive to
the state to merit continuing with the sale process,” the
National Treasury Management Agency, which is handling bank
restructuring for the state, said in a  statement  today.  The Irish government seized control of EBS, the nation’s
fifth-largest lender, last year and provided 525 million euros
($740 million) to bolster it against mounting bad-loan losses.
Ireland agreed as part of its bailout in November to inject a
further 438 million euros into the lender, even before the
conclusion of stress tests on the country’s banks tomorrow.  The group involving Ross’s WL Ross & Co., Dublin-based
investment boutique Cardinal Capital and  Carlyle Group , the
Washington-based private equity firm, said it wished “to
express extreme disappointment at the outcome of this extended
and extensive sales process.” The investors had offered to put
more than 600 million euros into EBS and had also commited to an
“extensive and expertly constructed multi-billion euro funding
and restructuring program to strengthen” the lender.  To contact the reporters on this story:
