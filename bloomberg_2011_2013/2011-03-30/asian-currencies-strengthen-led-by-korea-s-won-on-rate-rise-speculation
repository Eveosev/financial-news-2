Asian currencies strengthened, led
by  South Korea ’s won, on speculation the region’s central banks
will raise  interest rates  to combat accelerating inflation.  Taiwan’s monetary authority will increase its benchmark
rate by 0.125 percentage point to 1.75 percent tomorrow,
according to 17 of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
People’s Bank of  China  may raise borrowing costs once or twice
in the second quarter, Bank of China Ltd. economists said in a
report today. Bank of  Thailand  Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul
said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on March 28 that
“you can expect further adjustments” in interest rates.  “Interest-rate increases will attract foreign investors to
Asian countries like South Korea and Thailand which have wide
rate premiums,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based currency
trader at the Union Bank of  Taiwan .  The won climbed 0.6 percent to 1,104.10 per dollar as of
the 3 p.m. close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Philippine peso and Malaysia’s ringgit
strengthened 0.1 percent to 43.433 and 3.0260, respectively. The
Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index rose for a second day.  South Korea’s currency reached the strongest level since
Feb. 9 as overseas investors added to their holdings of the
nation’s shares for a 10th day, the longest run of net purchases
this year. Government data this week are expected to show
inflation accelerated to 4.8 percent in March from a year
earlier, the fastest in more than two years, according to the
median estimates of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Foreigners’ buying of the nation’s stocks is supporting
the won,” said Han Tae Gyu, a foreign-exchange trader at
 Shinhan Bank  in Seoul. “Also there’s no sign of intervention at
1,100 versus the dollar, a level which was believed to be
important to the government.”  Chinese Inflation  China’s yuan traded near a 17-year high, supported by
speculation the government will allow appreciation to help
contain rising prices. Inflation will average 4.9 percent in the
first three months of 2011, exceeding the official 4 percent
target for this year, the Bank of China report said.  “Beijing policy makers will stay with the gradual
tightening trajectory, which includes allowing the yuan to
appreciate at a rate of 5 to 6 percent this year,” said David Cohen, head of Asian forecasting at Action Economics in
 Singapore .  The yuan rose 0.08 percent to 6.5559 per dollar, according
to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It touched 6.5549 on
March 25, the strongest level since the country unified official
and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  Elsewhere, Thailand’s baht was unchanged at 30.34,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  India ’s rupee and
Indonesia’s rupiah were little changed at 44.765 and 8,715,
respectively. The Singapore dollar gained 0.1 percent to
S$1.2624, while the Taiwan dollar dropped 0.1 percent to
NT$29.51.  To contact the reporter on this story:
