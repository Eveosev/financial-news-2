Domino’s Pizza U.K. & Ireland Plc,
the U.K.’s biggest pizza-delivery company, said growth in sales
in the first quarter was slowed by a slump at outlets in
Ireland. The stock fell the most in more than two months.  Sales at 608 outlets open at least a year rose 4.2 percent
in the 13 weeks to March 30 compared with 10.5 percent at 553
stores a year earlier, the  Milton Keynes , England-based company
said in a Regulatory News Service statement today.  Sales at Irish outlets open at least a year fell 10.5
percent, while sales at U.K. outlets rose 5.5 percent. Sales of
food through Domino’s own outlets, known as system sales, grew
11.2 percent to 132.3 million pounds ($212 million).  “The overall group numbers, were, however, held back by
the very difficult trading environment in the Republic of
Ireland which contributes 7.4 percent of our system sales,”
Chief Executive Chris Moore said in the statement. “We are up
against some very challenging comparatives for the rest of the
year, especially in the second quarter.”  The company, which plans to open 60 outlets in 2011, said
it is well placed for further strong growth this year. Online
first-quarter sales rose 63 percent to 41.3 million pounds.  Domino shares fell as much as 11 percent, and closed down
4.2 percent to 427.2 pence at the 4:30 p.m. close in London
trading today, the biggest decline since Jan. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
