Indonesia ’s rupiah touched the
strongest level in almost four years after the central bank said
it will allow the currency to appreciate to temper inflation.
Benchmark bonds gained for a second day.  A government report on April 1 may show consumer prices
rose 6.99 percent this month from a year earlier, just short of
January’s 7.02 percent increase that was the biggest since April
2009, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Bank Indonesia  aims to reduce imported inflation
through the currency, Perry Warjiyo, director of economic
research at the bank, said March 25.  “Investors feel that Bank Indonesia is serious about
fighting inflation,” said Mika Martumpal, a senior market
analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta.  The rupiah was little changed at 8,717 per dollar as of
4:38 p.m. in Jakarta compared with 8,718 yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 8,701 earlier, the
strongest level since May 2007. The currency has advanced 3
percent this quarter, poised for its best three-month
performance in a year.  Indonesia last raised its benchmark  reference rate  by 25
basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 6.75 percent in
February, the first increase since October 2008. Policy makers
next meet on April 12.  Bank Indonesia may raise its key lending rate in the second
and third quarter of this year, Johanna Chua, the Hong Kong-
based head of Asian economic research at Citigroup, said at a
press conference in Jakarta today. “Markets are now very calm,
I don’t think there’s an urgency,” she said.  Ten-year  government bonds  advanced for a second day. The
yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 fell one basis
point to 8.10 percent, according to closing prices from the
Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
