Companies in the U.S. added more
workers in March, a sign the labor market may be strengthening,
data from a private report based on payrolls showed today.  Employment increased by 201,000 workers in March after a
revised 208,000 gain in February, according to figures from ADP
Employer Services. The median estimate in the Bloomberg News
survey called for a 208,000 gain.  Gains in  capital investment  and  consumer spending  are
prompting companies like  General Motors Co. (GM)  to boost staff,
helping the U.S. weather the highest energy prices in more than
two years. Businesses added 210,000 jobs in March and the
jobless rate held 8.9 percent, economists project a Labor
Department report to show in two days.  “This data is pointing to a turnaround in labor-market
conditions,”  Joel Prakken , chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers
LLC in  St. Louis , which produces the report in conjunction with
ADP, said in a conference call with reporters. “It’s pretty
clear that employment now has in fact accelerated. Equally
encouraging is the breadth of the strength.”  Projections of the 34 economists polled by Bloomberg ranged
from gains of 171,000 to 295,000.  Stock-index futures held earlier gains after the report.
The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index maturing in June
rose 0.5 percent to 1,322.6 at 8:52 a.m. in  New York .  Treasury
securities  were little changed.  Fewer Firings  Another report today showed employers announced fewer job
cuts in March than the same month last year, even as government
payroll cutbacks climbed to the highest level in a year. Planned
firings decreased 39 percent to 41,528 this month from March
2010, according to Chicago-based Challenger, Gray & Christmas
Inc. Public employees accounted for almost half of all job cuts.  Over the previous six reports, ADP’s initial figures were
closest to the Labor Department’s first estimate of private
payrolls in February, when it understated the gain in jobs by
5,000. The estimate was least accurate in December, when it
overestimated the employment gain by 184,000.  Today’s ADP report showed an increase of 37,000 workers in
goods-producing industries, the entire gain reflected a rise in
factory payrolls.  Service providers added 164,000 workers, ADP said.  Companies employing more than 499 workers expanded their
workforces by 17,000 jobs. Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to
499 employees, created 82,000 jobs and small companies increased
payrolls by 102,000, ADP said.  Small Businesses  Paychex Inc., which manages payroll accounting for
companies that employ fewer than 100 workers, said checks per
client rose 2.8 percent from a year ago in the quarter ended
Feb. 28, the biggest gain in at least two years. The data,
released with the company’s fiscal third-quarter earnings
last week, adds to other evidence showing growing confidence by
small businesses.  General Motors is among companies taking on more staff to
meet increased demand. The Detroit-based company will recall the
last of its laid-off workers by September, United Auto Workers
Vice President Joe Ashton said last week.  “We only have about 2,000 people now laid off and those
people will all be back to work in September,” Ashton, who
handles negotiations with GM, told union workers at the UAW’s
Special Convention on Collective Bargaining in  Detroit .  The  Federal Reserve  on March 15 said labor-market
conditions “appear to be improving gradually” and the economy
was on “firmer footing.’  Overall payrolls, which include government workers,
probably rose by 190,000 in March, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed before the Labor Department’s
April 1 report.  The ADP report is based on data from about 340,000
businesses employing more than 21 million workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
