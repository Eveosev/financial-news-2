Mauritius’s central bank may have
to make “more efforts” to “normalize”  interest rates , bank
of Mauritius Governor Rundheersing Bheenick said.  The March 28 decision to increase the benchmark rate by 50
basis points was well received, Bheenick said in a speech today
in  Port Louis , the capital.  The central bank raised the rate to 5.25 percent after
inflation accelerated faster than expected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
