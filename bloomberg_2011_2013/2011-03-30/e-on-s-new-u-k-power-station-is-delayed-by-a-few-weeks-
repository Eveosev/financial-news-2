E.ON AG (EOAN) , Germany’s biggest utility,
will delay the opening of its new natural-gas-fired power
station at the Isle of Grain, southeast England.  The  1,275-megawatt plant ’s three units have been testing
since last October. The station was due to start selling power
commercially by the end of this month and is “delayed by a few
weeks,”  Jonathan Smith , an E.ON spokesman based in Coventry,
England, said by phone today.  The waste heat from the power plant will eventually be
piped for use at National Grid Plc’s nearby liquefied natural
gas terminal. The system to send waste heat to the LNG site will
happen “very much later this year,” Smith said.  Power stations produce electricity for the grid while
testing. The plant was idle as of 4:30 p.m. today in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
