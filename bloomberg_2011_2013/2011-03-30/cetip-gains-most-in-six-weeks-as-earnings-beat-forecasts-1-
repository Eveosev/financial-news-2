Cetip SA - Balcao Organizado de
Ativos e Derivativos (CTIP3) ,  Brazil ’s biggest securities clearinghouse,
surged in Sao Paulo after fourth-quarter earnings beat analysts’
forecasts.  The stock jumped 6.3 percent to 26.15 reais at 4:15 p.m.
New York time. That’s the largest gain since Feb. 11, and a
record price since being listed in October 2009.  Cetip posted profit adjusted for some items of 65 million
reais ($39.7 million), surpassing the average estimate of 53.5
million reais in a Bloomberg survey of four analysts. Net
revenue climbed 60 percent to 90.6 million reais, according to a
statement posted on the company’s website last night. Net income
without adjustments was 22.2 million reais, little changed from
a year earlier.  “Robust top-line expansion, driven by stronger volumes in
several lines, was the main driver for earnings growth,”
Marcelo Telles, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG in  Sao
Paulo , wrote in a note to clients today. “Cetip should continue
to benefit from the promising outlook for volumes.”  Cetip on Dec. 29 completed its 2 billion-real purchase of
GRV Solutions SA, a provider of credit-risk management services,
according to the statement. The deal was first disclosed earlier
that month.  The acquisition will boost Cetip’s earnings this year,
Telles said. He rates the stock “outperform.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
