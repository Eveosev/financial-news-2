AES Gener SA (GENER) , the Chilean unit of
AES Corp., and water utility  Aguas Andinas SA (AGUAS/A)  rose for the first
time in four days after reaching an agreement on water rights
for Gener’s Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in central  Chile .  Gener climbed 0.4 percent to 250.54 pesos. Aguas Andinas
jumped 3.5 percent, the most since June 2009, to 235 pesos.  Gener agreed to pay Aguas Andinas for water from the Maipo
River for 40 years once the project begins operations in 2015 or
2016, according to an Aguas Andinas statement posted yesterday
on the website of Chile’s securities regulator. The amount to be
paid will depend on rainfall levels and electricity prices.  The agreement also guarantees Aguas Andinas unrestricted
access to the El Yeso reservoir to comply with its Santiago
supply contracts, the statement said. Final contracts with Gener
should be signed within the next six months, the statement said.  The 530-megawatt run-of-the-river project requires an
investment of about $600 million, according to Gener’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
