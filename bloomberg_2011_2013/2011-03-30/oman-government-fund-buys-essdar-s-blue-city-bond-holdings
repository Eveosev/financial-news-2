Onyx Investments Ltd., a fully
owned subsidiary of the government controlled Oman Investment
Fund, bought all of Essdar Investments Ltd.’s holdings of Blue
City bonds.  The notes purchased represent 100 percent of the Class A1
notes and 98.8 percent of the Class A3 notes issued by Blue
City, Oman Investment Fund said today. Essdar Investments is
managed by Essdar Capital Managers Ltd. whose majority
shareholder is the Abu Dhabi royal family.  Blue City, a stalled real estate project an hour’s drive
from the Omani capital, Muscat, was supposed to include more
than 200 villas, four hotels and two golf courses. A total of
$925 million was raised from bondholders to finance
construction, which started in 2006. The $20 billion project
missed sales targets as buyers left Middle East real estate
markets and a legal battle between the project’s owners
undermined confidence.  Onyx Investments and Oman Investment Fund have hired Cleary
Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP and Rothschild as their legal and
financial advisers respectively, according to a statement.
Neither company disclosed the price offered in the sale.  Essdar offered to buy the Class A notes it didn’t own in
June last year at $630.3 per $1,000 for $399 million of
outstanding Class A1 notes due 2013 and $624.8 per $1,000 for
$262.5 million of Class A3 notes due 2016. Essdar no longer
holds notes which had a face value of $658.25 million as of
November 2006, it said today in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
