Zoltan Aldott, head of the
management board at INA Industrija Nafte d.d., will take over
the duties of detained chief executive officer Bojan Milkovic
for 30 days, the company said.  The decision was made “to ensure the company’s business is
unaffected and it doesn’t represent a permanent solution,” INA
said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  Milkovic was detained for 30 days on corruption charges on
March 26.  Croatia ’s leading refiner is controlled by Hungary’s
Mol Nyrt, which holds 47.26 percent of the stock. The Croatian
government owns 44.84 percent.  The company also named Zelimir Sikonja as interim director
of research and production, it said in a statement. INA
reiterated its hope that the allegations against Milkovic will
be proven unfounded, it said in the statement.  Croatia’s  market regulator  on March 28 suspended trade in
INA stock through April 1. It acted “following significant
trading by foreign investors,” and to protect INA’s
shareholders, according to a statement on the watchdog’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
