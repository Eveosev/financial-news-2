India ’s benchmark index advanced
for a seventh day, the longest-winning streak since September,
as oil fell and speculation the economic recovery in the U.S.
will boost earnings spurred gains in Asian equities.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the nation’s largest
software services provider, gained 1.7 percent, a fifth straight
day of gains.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , the third-largest, climbed 1.4
percent, on course for its highest close since Jan. 20. Asian
stocks rose, driving the regional benchmark index higher for the
first time in three days, as Japanese companies resumed
production following the March 11 earthquake.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , India’s
biggest developer, rallied 4.7 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
rallied 206.85, or 1.1 percent, to 19,327.65, according to
preliminary closing prices as of 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai, set for
its highest close since Jan. 12. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the
National Stock Exchange added 1.1 percent to 5,798.95. The BSE
200 Index increased 1.2 percent to 2,370.58.  To contact the reporter on this story:
