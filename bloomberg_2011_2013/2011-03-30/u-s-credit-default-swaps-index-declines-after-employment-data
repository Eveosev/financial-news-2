The cost of protecting corporate
bonds from default in the U.S. fell to the lowest in almost a
week as growth in jobs added to signs the economy is improving.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 1.4 basis points to a
mid-price of 94.9 basis points as of 5:14 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. That’s the
lowest since 94.6 basis points on March 24.  “The expanding economy bodes well for fundamentals,” said
Anthony Valeri, a market strategist with San Diego-based  LPL
Financial  Corp., which oversees $293 billion. “Credit quality
is going to be stable this year.”  LPL Financial doesn’t expect a double-dip recession to
occur or companies to add excessive leverage through leveraged
buyouts or mergers and acquisitions, he said.  Employment increased by 201,000 workers in March after a
revised 208,000 gain in February, according to figures from ADP
Employer Services. The median estimate in the Bloomberg News
survey called for employment to climb by 208,000.  The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, climbed from
79.2 basis points on Feb. 8. It rolled to a new series on March
21, replacing companies that no longer had appropriate credit
grades, weren’t among the most actively traded or failed to meet
other criteria. The latest series started at 95 basis points.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
