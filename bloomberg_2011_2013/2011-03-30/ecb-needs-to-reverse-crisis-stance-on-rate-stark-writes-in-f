European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said the ECB needs to reverse the
interest rate stance it took during the financial crisis, and it
does not tailor monetary policy based on developments in
individual countries.  “At the height of the financial crisis, the ECB lowered
 interest rates  aggressively in the face of downside risks to
 price stability ,” Stark said in an article published on the
Financial Times website. “To the extent that these risks tilt
to the upside, the ECB needs to reverse its stance. If it
failed to respond symmetrically to the evolving circumstances,
investors would soon demand a higher premium to compensate for
the increased inflation risk.”  Stark said that the central bank “will always take a
eurozone perspective” and that it “cannot do any better than
take an area-wide perspective.”  Banks that were reliant on ECB funding need to take “full
advantage of government support measures for recapitalization,”
Stark said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
