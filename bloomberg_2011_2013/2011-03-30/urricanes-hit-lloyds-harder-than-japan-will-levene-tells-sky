Lloyd’s of London Chairman Peter Levene told Sky News claims arising from the natural disaster in
 Japan  won’t be “anything like as significant” as those that
followed the Atlantic hurricanes, including Katrina and Rita, in
2005.  “Our major exposure is modeled on what would happen if
such an earthquake hit  Tokyo ,” he said in an interview. “It
didn’t hit Tokyo,” Leven said.  The Japanese earthquake and tsunami “will be a major hit,
but one which we would regard as being in the normal course of
business,” Levene said to Sky News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
