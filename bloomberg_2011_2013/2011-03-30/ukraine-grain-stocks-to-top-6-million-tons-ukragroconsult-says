Ukrainian grain stockpiles will
exceed 6 million metric tons by June 30 after the government
approved an extension of quotas on cereal exports today,
researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  The estimated inventory level would be “a record number in
recent years,” the Kiev-based company said in an e-mailed
statement. The curbs will limit outbound grain shipments to 11.5
million tons in the year through June, compared with an export
potential of 15 million tons, it said.  The quotas, which had been scheduled to expire tomorrow,
will remain in force through June, the cabinet said. It also
added 2 million tons of corn to the existing limits of 4.2
million tons of barley, wheat and corn shipments.  Ukraine has a surplus of 1.5 million tons of wheat and 2.5
million tons of corn that can be shipped before June 30,
Interfax reported today, citing Volodymyr Klymenko, head of the
Ukrainian Grain Association. Exports of the surplus should be
permitted to help farmers sell crops and fund spring grain
planting, he said, according to the  news agency .  Grain exports declined 16 percent from a month earlier to
606,000 tons in March’s first 29 days, UkrAgroConsult said.
Outbound shipments came to 148,500 tons for wheat and 428,900
tons for corn, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
