Orascom Telecom Holdings SAE is in
talks with  Zimbabwe ’s government on cutting the stake in its
unit in the country to 49 percent from 60 percent, the Egyptian
company said.  The reduction in the holding of Telecel is in line with
Zimbabwe’s indigenization law that requires locals to own a
majority stake in foreign companies, it said in a statement
published in the Harare-based Herald newspaper today.  Zimbabwe’s Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act,
passed into law three year ago, seeks to transfer at least 51
percent control of all foreign-owned firms, including mines and
banks, to black citizens. The government issued a decree on
March 25 giving mining companies 45 days to submit plans on how
they will meet the rule.  Telecel Zimbabwe, the southern African nation’s second-
largest mobile-phone operator with 1.8 million subscribers, is
currently 40 percent owned by a group of local investors.  Econet
Wireless Zimbabwe Ltd. (ECWH)  has more than 5 million subscribers,
while the state-owned NetOne is the third-biggest operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
