South African credit growth slowed
in March as consumers took advantage of low  interest rates  to
reduce debt in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  Borrowing by households and businesses rose an annual 5.1
percent, down from 5.4 percent in February, the Pretoria-based
 Reserve Bank  said on its website today. The median estimate of
eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 5.9 percent.  The Reserve Bank cut its benchmark interest rate three
times last year to a 30-year low of 5.5 percent to help support
the economy’s recovery.  Consumer spending , which accounts for
two-thirds of demand in the economy, has picked up gradually,
while manufacturers are still holding back on investments.  “Credit markets are going to remain fairly tight,” said
 George Glynos , managing director of Econometrix Treasury
Management in Johannesburg. “There is no underlying demand for
credit. We probably won’t see a rate increase well into next
year.”  The rand was at 6.6195 against the dollar as of 9:24 a.m.
in Johannesburg from 6.6050 before the data was released. The
yield on the R157 government bond, due 2015, was unchanged at
7.62 percent.  Consumers’ disposable income grew at a slower pace of 5.3
percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 5.5 percent in the
previous three months, the central bank said on March 22. Growth
in spending on durable goods such as furniture eased to 6.9
percent from 13.4 percent in the period.  Governor Gill Marcus left the key interest rate unchanged
for a second meeting in March, saying that rising gasoline and
food costs were the biggest threats to inflation. The bank aims
to keep the inflation rate, which reached a nine-month high of
4.1 percent in March, inside a range of 3 percent to 6 percent.  The broad M3 measure of  money supply  increased an annual
6.5 percent in March, down from 7.6 percent in February. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for M3 to expand 7.8
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
