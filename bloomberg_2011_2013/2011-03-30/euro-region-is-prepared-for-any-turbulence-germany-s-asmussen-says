German Deputy Finance Minister
Joerg Asmussen said the euro region is prepared for any
financial-market “turbulence” resulting from the bloc’s
sovereign-debt crisis.  “We have the strengthened Stability and Growth Pact, we
have the euro-plus pact for competitiveness, we have the
design of the permanent crisis-resolution mechanism, the
ESM,” Asmussen said in an interview on his way to  China ,
where German officials will participate in Group of 20 talks
tomorrow in Nanjing. “We will explain the results in detail
to our partners. We are well-suited for turbulence that may
arise in financial markets.”  It’s “completely up to”  Portugal ’s government to
decide whether and what kind of assistance it may need, he
said. The euro region stands ready, accompanied by
International Monetary Fund instruments, “but of course
fully under a complete adjustment program under strict
conditionality,” he said.  Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service yesterday cut
Portugal’s credit rating for the second time in four days,
saying the country will probably need an international
bailout and debt restructuring. Portuguese 10-year bonds fell,
pushing the yield above 8 percent for the first time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
