WPP Plc (WPP)  Chief Executive Officer
 Martin Sorrell  told Sky News in an interview his company’s
return to the U.K. from Ireland depends on the approval of his
board and shareholders.  Should the board and the shareholders approve the decision,
then “on the basis” of what Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said in the budget and given that “the legislation is
implemented” and “the promises are carried out,” the company
will “absolutely, for sure” come back to the U.K., Sorrell
said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
