The  mayor  of a city neighboring
the nuclear power plant devastated by  Japan ’s March 11
earthquake and subsequent tsunami criticized the central
government for leaving him in the dark.  About 50,000 of Minami Soma’s 70,000 residents were
evacuated after the magnitude-9.0 temblor and surge of water
led to the worst atomic accident since Chernobyl. Tokyo
Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi power plant lies 25
kilometers (16 miles) south of the mayor’s office.  “The government tells us to be ready for further
evacuation orders in case of a ‘worst-case scenario,’ but I
wonder what that suggests?” Katsunobu Sakurai said in a
telephone interview. “We want to get on with rebuilding our
city. We just don’t have the sort of information we need from
the government.”  While essential services including water, gas and
electricity are about 80 percent restored, the city remains
in desperate need of food and gasoline, Sakurai said. As the
government evacuated people within 20 kilometers of the plant
and warned those within the next 10 kilometers to stay
indoors, truck drivers stopped coming in with supplies.  “As if it wasn’t enough that we were struck by the
disaster, people began treating us as if we were a highly
contaminated city,” Sakurai, 55, said. Lack of fuel meant
“we have to walk all the way to the edge of the evacuation
zone to pick up supplies.”  About 80 percent of the city is within the 30-kilometer
zone, he said.  Evacuation Zone  Residents evacuated from a 20-kilometer radius of the
plant shouldn’t return home, chief government spokesman  Yukio Edano  said, citing safety risks. Some people had gone back to
pick up belongings, he said.  Repairs at the Dai-Ichi power plant have been hampered
by explosions, fires and radiation leaks, forcing work to be
suspended. Three workers were exposed to radiation on March
24 after stepping in water at one of the six units.  The  number of dead and missing  from the March 11
earthquake, tsunami and subsequent aftershocks had reached
27,593 as of 10 a.m. today. Several hundred thousand people
have been made homeless and are living in temporary shelters.  On March 25, Sakurai met with Tadahiro Matsushita,
Japan’s vice minister of  economy, trade and industry , and
asked for an official to be placed in his office to make sure
that information is delivered in a more timely manner so
appropriate steps can be taken for the city’s residents.  “We are determined to rebuild our city from scratch,
but in doing so, we need more concrete information,” Sakurai
said. “Politicians must be more open and give clear
directions for our citizens -- listening to press conferences
that give no hope just feeds into more worries and
distrust.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
