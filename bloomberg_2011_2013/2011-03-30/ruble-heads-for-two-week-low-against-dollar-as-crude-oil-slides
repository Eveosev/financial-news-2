The ruble depreciated to its lowest
level in two weeks against the dollar as rising U.S. supplies of
oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, stoked speculation demand for
the commodity may falter.  The ruble lost 0.5 percent to 28.5595 per dollar by the 5
p.m. close in Moscow, the weakest since March 17. The currency
slid 0.7 percent to 40.2375 per euro, leaving it down 0.6
percent at 33.8146 versus the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket.  Crude for May delivery dropped as much as 77 cents to
$104.02 a barrel in New York after the industry-funded  American
Petroleum Institute  said stockpiles climbed 5.7 million barrels
last week, advancing for the fourth week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
