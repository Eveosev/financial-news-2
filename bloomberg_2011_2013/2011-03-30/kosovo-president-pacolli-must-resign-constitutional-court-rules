(Corrects vote count in second paragraph.)  Kosovo’s  top court  ruled that
President Beghjet Pacolli must resign because his election
violated the constitution.  The Constitutional Court in Pristina ruled by a vote of 7-2
that Pacolli’s election “is unconstitutional and will not be
effective from the date of its publishing,” it said in a
statement on its website today.  Lawmakers in the capital Pristina chose Pacolli on Feb. 22
as the country’s president after his party agreed to become a
junior partner in the coalition of Prime Minister Hashim Thaci.
Thaci received another mandate to form the government after an
early vote in December, triggered by another ruling of the
Kosovo constitutional court.  The poorest among the nations that emerged from former
 Yugoslavia , Kosovo needs to improve relations with  Serbia , root
out corruption and rekindle the economy to gain visa-free travel
to the European Union and eventually join the bloc.  Serbia, also aiming for a speedy EU entry, refuses to
recognize its former province and is joined by five of the 27-
bloc members in doing so.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization went to war with
Serbia in 1999 to free the region from  Slobodan Milosevic ’s
repression of the ethnic Albanian population, the final military
conflict in the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The nation of 2
million people won the recognition of 22 of the EU’s 27 members
and the U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
