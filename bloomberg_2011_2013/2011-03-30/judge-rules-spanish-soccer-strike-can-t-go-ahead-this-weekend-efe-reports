A Spanish judge ruled a strike
planned by the national soccer league this weekend can’t go
ahead, Efe news wire reported.  League officials had planned to call off games involving Real
 Madrid , Barcelona and other top clubs as they press the
government to change a long-standing law that requires one game
per week to be on free-to-air television. They say it reduces
the value of teams’ broadcast contracts.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
