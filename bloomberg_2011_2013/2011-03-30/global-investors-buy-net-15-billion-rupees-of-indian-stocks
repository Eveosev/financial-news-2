Overseas investors bought a net 15
billion rupees ($335.9 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
reducing their outflow from equities this year to 35.4 billion
rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners purchased 36.7 billion rupees of shares and sold
21.7 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They sold a net 7.7 billion rupees of bonds, paring
their purchases in debt this year to 114.2 billion rupees.  Global investors, attracted by  India ’s economic expansion,
bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of shares in 2010, lifting
the benchmark index 17 percent and making it the best performer
among the world’s 10 biggest equity markets. The gauge has shed
about 6 percent this year.  Foreign funds have placed 4.436 trillion rupees in equities
and 901 billion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into the
country in 1993. The previous record was in 2009 when flows
reached 834.2 billion rupees, sparking the biggest advance in 18
years. Funds withdrew a record 530 billion rupees from stocks in
2008, setting off the worst annual slump.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
