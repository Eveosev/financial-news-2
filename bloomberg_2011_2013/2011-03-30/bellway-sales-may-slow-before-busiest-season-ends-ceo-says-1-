Bellway Plc (BWY) , the second-worst
performing U.K. homebuilder in the past 12 months, said its
sales may fall during the busiest selling period of the year for
the industry amid “fragile” consumer confidence.  The company sold an average of 119 homes a week during the
past two months, about 7 percent more than a year ago,
Newcastle, England-based Bellway said in a statement today.  “Will this better rate of sale continue or will the market
fall away again?” Chief Executive Officer John Watson said
today in an interview. “Would it fall back to rates we had
before Christmas -- the 80 a week? It could fall back to that.”  Homebuilders typically generate most property reservations
during the spring selling season, which runs from February to
June, Panmure Gordon analyst Rachael Waring said. U.K.
homebuilders are counting on a pickup in business after a
decline in  consumer confidence , caused by the government’s
planned spending cuts, hurt demand in the fourth quarter.  Bellway rose 30 pence, or 4.4 percent, to 712 pence at the
4:30 p.m. close in London trading. The shares have risen 6.3
percent in this year, while the Bloomberg EMEA Home Builders
Index has climbed 14 percent.  “It is entirely possible that the current strength in
demand evident almost since New Year’s Day is actually the
spring come early,” Robin Hardy, an analyst at Peel Hunt in
London with a “sell” rating on the stock, said in a note to
investors yesterday.  Earnings Increase  Net income climbed to 18.5 million pounds in the six months
through January from 14 million pounds a year earlier, the
company said today in a statement. Revenue increased 13 percent
to 407.9 million pounds.  The number of homes sold rose 3.8 percent to 2,332 in the
six months through January, Bellway said. The average selling
price of its homes rose 8 percent to 168,428 pounds ($270,782).  “Housebuilders really suffered in the fourth quarter and
all entered 2011 with lower order books,” Waring said today.
“So it was really important that the first quarter of 2011 got
off to a good start.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
