The rate at which European banks
say they see each other lending in euros for three months rose
to the highest level since June 2009.  The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, increased for
a ninth consecutive day, rising 1.2 basis points to 1.231
percent today, according to the European Banking Federation.
Thatâ€™s the highest level since June 18, 2009, and the biggest
daily increase since March 4, the EBF data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
