Michael Clarke  was appointed as
captain of Australia’s Test and one-day cricket teams after
Ricky Ponting stood down from the role.  Clarke’s first assignment as his country’s full-time
skipper will be next month’s three-match one-day series in
Bangladesh. Shane Watson was named as his vice-captain.      Clarke, who turns 30 in three days, replaces a captain who
won 48 of 77 Tests, more than any other skipper in 134 years of
elite cricket. Ponting also led Australia to the 2003 and 2007
World Cup titles and won more than three-quarters of his 228
one-day matches as captain.  Following the tour to Bangladesh, Australia is scheduled to
visit Sri Lanka and  South Africa  for back-to-back Test and one-
day series. Clarke’s team will then return home to face  New
Zealand  before hosting top-ranked India in a best-of-four Test
series.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
