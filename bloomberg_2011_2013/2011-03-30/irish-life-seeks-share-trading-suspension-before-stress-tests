Irish Life  & Permanent Plc, the
nation’s only government-guaranteed lender to avoid a bailout so
far, sought a temporary suspension in trading in its shares
until April 1, after the results of stress tests of the
country’s lenders are revealed.  Shares in the Dublin-based lender plunged by 34 euro cent,
or 45 percent, to 41 cents yesterday on concern that the state
may be forced to take a majority stake in the company after the
publication of the test results tomorrow.  Irish Life “notes the recent media comment” on its
expected capital requirement after the assessment, the company
said in a statement today. The tests “are not completed and the
quantum of capital that may be required by the group, and the
source of that capital, is not yet finalized,” it said.  The  stress tests  mark a third attempt in a year by Ireland,
which has injected 46.3 billion euros ($65.2 billion) into its
unprofitable lenders over the past two years, to assuage
investor concern that loans will continue to sour. The main
focus of this year’s tests is on home loan portfolios, after
lenders were forced to sell 72.3 billion euros of risky
commercial real-estate loans to the state last year at an
average discount of 58 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
