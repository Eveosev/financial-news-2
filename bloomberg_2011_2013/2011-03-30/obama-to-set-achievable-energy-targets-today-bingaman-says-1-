President  Barack Obama  will outline
achievable energy targets that may win bipartisan support in
Congress, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman
Jeff Bingaman said.  Obama will offer oil and gas companies incentives to
develop federal leases as a part of his plan to reduce U.S. oil
imports by a third in about a decade, according to two
administration officials, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity before a speech at  Georgetown University  later today.  “What he’s talking about today is what he thinks are
achievable objectives for this Congress,” Bingaman said at an
event sponsored by PoliticoPro in  Washington . “It’s a tough
time to get much accomplished in Washington.”  Bingaman’s committee will propose legislation supporting
greater use of electric cars and natural gas, to cut dependence
on imported fuel. Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat, also said he
plans to consider tightening requirements for holders of federal
leases, to ensure the resources are developed.  Oil and gas companies are producing from less than 20
percent of leases in the  Gulf of Mexico  and are using 43 percent
of leases on federal lands, the Interior Department said in a
report requested by Obama and released yesterday.  House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings, a
Republican from Washington, proposed three bills yesterday aimed
at boosting the U.S. offshore oil output to 3 million barrels a
day by opening Atlantic for exploration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
