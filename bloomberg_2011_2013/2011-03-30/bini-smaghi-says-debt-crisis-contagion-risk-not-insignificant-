European Central Bank Executive
Board member Lorenzo  Bini Smaghi  said the risk of Europe’s
sovereign debt crisis spreading to other European Union or euro-
area nations is “not insignificant.”  “The main source of concern is the interplay between
fiscal imbalances, downside risks to economic growth and bank
funding vulnerabilities,” Bini Smaghi said in a speech in
Moscow today, according to a text published by the ECB.
“Although this interplay is limited to a small number of euro-
area countries, with a relatively small share of total EU and
euro-area GDP, potential contagion to other EU or euro-area
countries is not insignificant.”  Bini Smaghi said he’s surprised “to see how quickly some
of the lessons of the crisis are being forgotten,” adding that
the risk of contagion has to be part of any systemic assessment
of  Europe ’s financial system.  The underlying scenarios in banking stress tests being
carried out are, compared to the previous round in 2010,
“considerably more adverse,” Bini Smaghi said. National bank
supervisors have less discretion now in how the tests are
conducted, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
