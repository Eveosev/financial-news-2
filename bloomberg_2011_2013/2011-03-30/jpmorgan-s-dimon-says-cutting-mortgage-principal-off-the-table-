(Corrects comment in the second paragraph to refer to
people who are able pay mortgages.)  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief
Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  said cutting debt for home
borrowers isn’t the solution to the U.S. mortgage crisis.  Principal reduction for people who are able to pay their
mortgages is “off the table,” Dimon told reporters today after
speaking at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event in Washington.
Dimon said the New York-based bank already reduces principal for
some borrowers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
