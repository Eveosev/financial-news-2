The Bovespa stock index advanced
for a second day as Brazil’s central bank signaled it will slow
the pace of interest rate increases this year.  Banco Bradesco SA, Brazil’s second-biggest bank by market
value, led gains for companies that benefit from credit growth.
Homebuilder  Brookfield Incorporacoes SA (BISA3)  rose after it reported a
65 percent increase in fourth-quarter net income.  The Bovespa climbed 0.9 percent to 67,997.06 at the close
of Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time. Fifty stocks
rose on the index, while 15 fell. The measure is down 1.9
percent this quarter, the biggest three-month decline since the
three months ended June 30. The real strengthened 1.1 percent to
1.6285 per  U.S. dollar , and interest rate futures yields
declined.  “It looks like the tightening cycle will be shorter than
we expected,” said Joao Pedro Brugger, who helps oversee 70
million reais ($43 million) at Leme Investimentos in
Florianopolis, Brazil. “This is positive for the equity market,
especially for homebuilders and consumer stocks.”  The central bank said it will seek to bring inflation down
to its 4.5 percent target in 2012 as the costs of meeting that
goal through interest rate hikes this year would be too high.  Inflation in Latin America’s largest economy will slow to
4.4 percent in 2012 from 5.5 percent in 2011 should policy
makers raise the benchmark interest rate to 12.5 percent and the
 exchange rate  remains stable, according to central bank
forecasts published today.  Inflation Slows  Yields on futures contracts due in January, the most traded
today, sank 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 12.12
percent.  Brazil’s monthly inflation, as measured by the IGP-M  price
index , slowed to 0.62 percent in March from 1 percent in
February, the Getulio Vargas Foundation said. This compares with
the median 0.69 percent forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 28
analysts.  Bradesco advanced 3.1 percent to 32.45 reais. The MSCI’s
index of Brazilian financial shares jumped 4.7 percent, the most
in 10 months. Brookfield gained 1.7 percent to 8.24 reais.  Vale SA slid 0.6 percent to 47.07 reais. The iron-ore miner
said in a regulatory filing an “unfavorable” decision was made
by a federal regional court today on how income from its foreign
subsidiaries should be taxed. Vale said it will appeal the
decision and no payments will be made until higher courts rule
on the case. The value being contested is 25.6 billion reais,
Vale said in a 2009 statement.  New Vale Chief?  Separately, Banco Bradesco SA, a shareholder in the
controlling group of Vale, will nominate Tito Botelho Martins to
replace Roger Agnelli as the company’s Chief Executive Officer,
Folha de S.Paulo said. Bradesco will announce the nomination of
Martins, Vale’s director for base metals, in a statement by
Friday, the newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Bradesco denied the report in an e-mailed statement.  Cetip SA - Balcao Organizado de Ativos e Derivativos,
 Brazil ’s biggest securities clearinghouse, jumped 6.3 percent to
26.15 reais after fourth-quarter earnings beat forecasts. The
company posted profit adjusted for some items of 65 million
reais, surpassing the average estimate of 53.5 million reais in
a Bloomberg survey of four analysts.  The Bovespa has retreated this year as homebuilders and
banks fell on concern faster inflation will limit growth,
outweighing gains in oil and steel producers. The index trades
at 10.7 times analysts’ earnings estimates, according to weekly
data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of 14 for
the Shanghai Composite Index, 7.5 for  Russia ’s Micex, and 17.8
for  India ’s Sensex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
