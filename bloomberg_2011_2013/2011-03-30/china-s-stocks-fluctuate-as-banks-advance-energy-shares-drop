China’s stocks fell for a second
day, narrowing a monthly gain, on concern that central bank may
raise  interest rates  to tame inflation and liquidity is
tightening before next week’s national holidays.  A gauge of smaller companies slid to the lowest in a month
on speculation local banks are hoarding cash before holidays in
the first two days of next week. Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. led
declines for coal producers as oil prices slumped. Anhui Conch
Cement Co. jumped 4.9 percent after the cement producer’s shares
were upgraded by First Capital Securities and SWS Research.
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world’s
largest bank by market value, advanced before earnings today.  “There’s an 80 percent chance that the central bank will
increase interest rates in April and some investors are pulling
their money out from stocks before the long weekend,” said
Richard Chen, a strategist at Jianghai Securities Co. “With the
concerns about rate increases, the market outlook isn’t
optimistic for the coming two weeks.”  The  Shanghai  Composite Index dropped 2.3 points, or 0.1
percent, to 2,955.77 at the 3 p.m. close. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  lost
0.1 percent to 3,256.08. The CSI Smallcap 500 Index declined 0.9
percent to 5,064.55, the lowest since March 3.  The Shanghai Composite has climbed 5.3 percent this year on
optimism the world’s second-biggest economy will withstand
tighter monetary policies. The central bank has raised rates
three times since October to cool inflation that reached 4.9
percent in February, exceeding the government’s 4 percent annual
target. It has boosted banks’ reserve requirements nine times
since the start of 2010, including a March 18 increase.  The central bank may increase rates once or twice in the
second quarter, Bank of  China  Ltd. economists said in a report
today on the nation’s economic outlook. The central bank last
increased rates on Feb. 8, the final day of a weeklong holiday.  Inflation Outlook  Inflation may peak at 5.5 percent in March, moderate and
then peak again at 5.5 to 6 percent in June, Ting Lu, economist
at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, said in a report today. The
inflation data for March is scheduled to be released on April 15.  Policymakers were “highly concerned” about media reports
that companies are planning to raise prices on daily  consumer
goods , China National Radio reported yesterday, citing an
unidentified official at the National Development and Reform
Commission.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, surged 44 basis points to 2.57 percent,
the biggest increase since March 21, according to a weighted
average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  Banks Gain  “Banks are collecting cash to prepare for withdrawal
demand during the holidays next week,” said Guo Caomin, a bond
analyst at Industrial Bank Co. in Shanghai. “Also, they are
trying to meet all types of  capital requirements  at the end of
each quarter.”  Agricultural Bank of China  gained 0.4 percent to 2.75 yuan
Net income increased 46 percent last year to 94.87 billion yuan.
That exceeded the 91.1 billion yuan average estimate of 17
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “As a result of the tight monetary environment in China,
we expect ABC will continue to benefit from expanding net
interest margins in 2011,”  Michael Werner , a Hong Kong-based
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., wrote in a note today.  ICBC, the world’s largest bank by market value, advanced
0.2 percent to 4.52 yuan. The bank will likely say 2010 profit
climbed 27 percent to 163.8 billion yuan, according to the mean
estimate of 19 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. ICBC is scheduled
to publish earnings after the market close today.  Smallcaps Drop  Small-caps dropped on concern shares are expensive given
the prospect that obtaining loans will be more difficult this
year. The  CSI Smallcap 500 Index (SH000905)  trades at 46 times reported
earnings, compared with 18.7 times for the CSI 300 Index.  Domestic banks offered 1.58 trillion yuan of new loans in
the first two months of this year, 25 percent less than the
same period a year earlier, according to the central bank.  “With some of the smaller cap stocks, you have to
consider liquidity,” Gary Motyl, chief investment officer
at Templeton, part of Franklin Templeton Investments, said in an
interview last month. “We tend to go with the large, more
liquid names and we think, in the long term, they are fine.”  Jiangsu Guotai International Group Guomao Co. retreated 8.3
percent to 26 yuan, the most in the smallcap gauge. Tsinghua
Tongfang Co. led technology companies lower, falling 2.5 percent
to 25.74 yuan. Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co. extended losses
to a third day, sliding 0.6 percent to 19.26 yuan.  Developers Drop  A gauge tracking property developers in the Shanghai
Composite Index sank 1.4 percent, the most among five industry
groups. Poly Real Estate Group Co., the nation’s second-largest
developer, retreated 2.8 percent to 13.60 yuan.  Beijing aims to lower the average price of new homes in the
city this year as compared with 2010, the municipal government
said in a statement on its website yesterday.  A gauge tracking energy producers in the CSI 300 retreated
0.6 percent. Yanzhou Coal fell 1.1 percent to 34.94 yuan,
trimming a two-day, 6 percent rally after the company reported
record earnings on March 27.  Oil prices  dropped after the  American Petroleum Institute 
said stockpiles climbed 5.7 million barrels last week, advancing
for the fourth week. Crude for May delivery fell as much as 66
cents to $104.13 a barrel in  New York , and was at $104.62 at
3:11 p.m. Singapore time.  Anhui Conch halted a two-day slide, jumping 4.9 percent to
41 yuan after the shares were upgraded by First Capital
Securities and SWS Research. First Capital rated the stock an
“add,” while SWS gave it a “buy” rating. The stock has surged 15
percent this month.  --Irene Shen. With assistance from Judy Chen. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
