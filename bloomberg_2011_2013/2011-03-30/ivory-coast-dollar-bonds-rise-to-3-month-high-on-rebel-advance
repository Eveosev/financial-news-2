Ivory Coast’s  defaulted Eurobonds
surged to the highest in three months as rebels loyal to
President-elect  Alassane Ouattara  are within "striking distance"
of the commercial capital, said the United Nations.  The $2.3 billion bonds due 2032 of the world’s biggest
cocoa producer advanced 6.2 percent to 42.357 cents on the
dollar, the highest price since Jan. 4, as of 4:30 p.m. in
London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield fell
45 basis points to 8.141 percent.  The rebels who support Ouattara, the internationally
recognized winner of the disputed Nov. 28 election, have
advanced “much more rapidly than expected” and have seized
“several strategic” towns on their approach to Abidjan, Young- jin Choi, the head of the UN mission in the country, said in an
interview with  CNN . Security forces loyal to incumbent ruler
 Laurent Gbagbo , who refused to cede power, are not fighting
back, he said.  Investors have “priced in the end game,” David Damiba,
managing director of London-based Renaissance Asset Managers,
said by phone today. “The end game now looks like it’s going to
be about the rebels coming from the north and capturing town by
town and they find themselves closer to Abidjan and Gbagbo would
basically have no choice.”  The Eurobonds have lost 31 percent of their value since
they were issued in April last year as  Ivory Coast  reneged on a
$29 million interest payment Feb. 1 after the nation’s election
political stalemate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
