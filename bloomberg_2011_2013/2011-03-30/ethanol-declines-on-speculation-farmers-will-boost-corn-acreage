Ethanol futures sank in  Chicago  on
speculation that a government report tomorrow will show farmers
plan to increase the amount of acreage planted with corn.  The U.S. Agriculture Department report may show corn
acreage rising to the second-most since 1944, according to a
survey of analysts by Bloomberg News. The price of corn, the
primary ingredient in U.S.-made ethanol, has increased 87
percent in the past year.  “It feels like the expectation is for a bearish corn
report,” said Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global Markets
Inc. in Chicago. “People were kind of going to the sidelines
ahead of the report. You saw ethanol drifting with that.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery slid 1.6 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.476 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 58 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  tumbled 5.5
cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.555 a gallon and on the West Coast
the additive slipped 4.5 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.665,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf lost 4 cents, or 1.5 percent, to
$2.60 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel fell 3.5 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.475.  Corn for May delivery dropped 8.5 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
$6.6375 a bushel in Chicago, up 9 percent from $6.165 on March
16. One bushel makes about 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
