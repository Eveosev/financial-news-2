(Corrects new position in second graph.)  The prosecutor leading
investigations into alleged coup plots against Turkish Prime
Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  has been promoted and hence may be
removed from the case, NTV television reported.  Turkey’s High Council of Judges and Prosecutors promoted
special prosecutor Zekeriya Oz to deputy chief state prosecutor
for Istanbul, NTV said.  Oz may be removed from the “Ergenekon” coup plot case,
which has led to the arrests or imprisonment of dozens of
military officers, writers and journalists, NTV said.  Oz said the move was “unexpected,” NTV reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
