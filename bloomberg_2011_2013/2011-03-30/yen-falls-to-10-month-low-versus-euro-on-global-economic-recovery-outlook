The yen fell to a 10-month low
against the euro on speculation the global economic recovery is
gaining momentum, reducing demand for the Japanese currency as a
refuge.  The yen declined to as low as 117.45 per euro, the weakest
level since May 13, and traded at 117.42 as of 7:51 a.m. in
 Tokyo , from 117.10 yen in  New York  yesterday. It fell to 83.14
yen against the dollar from 82.89 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
