Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  Chief Executive
Officer Andrew Liveris repaid more than $700,000 inaccurately
billed to the company for personal expenses dating back to 2007
while travelling abroad, the  Detroit News  reported, citing
company spokesman Declan Kelly.  Liveris had paid an undisclosed amount for personal
expenses for the period and wasn’t aware of the billing by the
department that handled them, the newspaper said.  The expenses, disclosed after an internal audit, aren’t
likely to draw a federal investigation, the newspaper said.     Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
