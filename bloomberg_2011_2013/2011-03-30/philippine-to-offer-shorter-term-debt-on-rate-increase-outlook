The Philippine Treasury will offer
debt due in 10 years or less in the next quarter amid
speculation the central bank will raise  interest rates  further,
Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said.  The  Bureau of the Treasury  will offer debt due in four-,
seven- and 10-years in the three months ending June, according
to a notice on its website. It raised the size of the 91-day
Treasury bill offering to 1.5 billion pesos ($35 million) from a
previous 1 billion pesos due to demand, Mendiola said.  “Until we see a more quiet market, we will tend to avoid
issuing the long-dated bonds,” Mendiola said in a phone
interview today in Manila, before the Treasury posted the
announcement.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas last week raised its benchmark
overnight borrowing rate to 4.25 percent from a record low of 4
percent to cap inflation that accelerated to a nine-month high
in February. Authorities are “ready to undertake further
action” as inflation may exceed 5 percent in some months this
year, central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said yesterday.  Consumer price gains quickened to 4.3 percent in February
and may peak in the second or third quarter, Tetangco said
yesterday.  The yield on the 8.125 percent December 2035 peso bond fell
four basis points to 7.975 percent, the lowest since Jan. 5,
data from Tradition Financial Services Inc. showed.  To contact the reporters for this story:
