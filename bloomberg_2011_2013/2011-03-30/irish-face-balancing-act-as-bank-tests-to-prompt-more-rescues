Ireland may merge two of its
biggest lenders as part of a raft of measures aimed at drawing a
line under Europe’s worst banking crisis.  The government is considering folding EBS Building Society,
the fifth-largest, into  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK) , the second-
largest, according to two people with knowledge of the
situation. An announcement may come today after the central bank
publishes the results of bank stress tests at 4:30 p.m. in
Dublin, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the matter isn’t yet public.  The country is taking “the first step in making changes to
the financial system that are long overdue,” Phil Hogan,
Ireland’s environment minister, told national broadcaster RTE
Radio today. Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  will later in
parliament announce “important decisions,” Hogan said.  Ireland is trying to show investors, its taxpayers and the
rest of the euro region that the nation has plugged all the
holes in the banking system, whose collapse so far cost 46.3
billion euros ($65.8 billion) in capital and crippled what was
once  Europe ’s most dynamic economy.  The third round of stress tests covers Bank of Ireland Plc,
whose shares have dropped 65 percent over the last six months,
Allied Irish, EBS and Irish Life & Permanent Plc. Noonan will
set out how more money the banks need from a 35 billion-euro
bailout fund set aside for them.  “There is no overnight solution here,” said Gavin Blessing, a bond analyst at  Collins Stewart Plc (CLST)  in Dublin.
“It’s going to be quarters or even years before these banks can
raise debt at attractive levels and fund themselves
independently again in the wholesale market.”  Bailout Fund  Ireland’s banks were reliant on the  European Central Bank 
for 88.7 billion euros of funding at the end of last month, the
Irish central bank said today. They may have borrowed as much as
an additional 70.1 billion euros in exceptional liquidity from
the Irish central bank, according to figures on March 11.  The government may have to inject 27.5 billion euros extra
into the banks in total, according to a survey of 10 analysts
and economists by Bloomberg News.  This would exhaust about 80 percent of the bank fund set up
last year as part of Ireland’s bailout by the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund . The fund includes 17.5 billion
euros from Ireland’s own resources.  “A realistic number would be 40 billion euros,” said
Brian Lucey, associate professor of finance at Trinity College,
Dublin. “They will come in between 25 billion euros to 30
billion euros. Anything more will be a difficult sell.”  Bank of Ireland  Bank of Ireland, the largest lender, will seek as much as 5
billion euros, said two people with knowledge of the matter.
 Irish Life  will require more than 3 billion euros, while EBS
will need about 1 billion euros, three people with knowledge of
the banks said. The people declined to be identified because the
figures aren’t yet public.  The government controls four of the six domestic lenders,
including Anglo Irish Bank Corp., which epitomized Ireland’s
building boom and collapsed with the bursting of the property
bubble and 15 percent decline in gross domestic product. Anglo
Irish said today its final pretax loss was 17.7 billion euros
for 2010, a record for an Irish company.  A fifth bank, Irish Life, yesterday suspended its shares
until tomorrow on speculation the state will have to take
majority control. The stock fell 45 percent on March 29. The
company is weighing the sale of its profitable life assurance
and investment management units to shore up its bank business,
three people with knowledge of the talks said yesterday.  Announcements  Noonan decided yesterday to scrap the sale of state-owned
EBS to a group including U.S. billionaire  Wilbur Ross ’s
leveraged-buyout firm and Dublin-based Cardinal Capital Group.
The state said in December is was acquiring 93 percent of Allied
Irish, while it seized full control of EBS in May.  After central bank Governor  Patrick Honohan , 61, publishes
the results of the stress tests, Noonan, 67, who worked with
Honohan in government in the 1980s, will address parliament
shortly afterwards.  The main focus of this year’s assessment is on home loan
portfolios after lenders were forced to sell 72.3 billion euros
of risky commercial real-estate loans to the state last year at
an average discount of 58 percent.  Deposits by Irish residents fell 9.8 percent in February
from a year earlier, the central bank said today in Dublin. The
decline was 1.8 billion euros over the month, it said.  The ECB expects Ireland to stand ready with a “backstop
facility” for Irish banks, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, an ECB
executive board member, said yesterday.  Russian Car  Armed with the stress tests results, Ireland’s month-old
Fine Gael-led government will seek to reopen the terms of the
country’s 85 billion-euro bailout inked in November. Noonan will
bring the results to a meeting of European finance ministers in
Budapest starting on April 8 as he pushes for a reduction in the
5.8 percent interest rate on the loans.  The government also said it wants the ECB to provide
longer-term financing for the banking system, and is seeking
permission to share losses with senior bank bondholders.
European policy makers are opposed to imposing losses on bank
bondholders, on concern that it may reignite a banking crisis
across the euro region.  Irish authorities also want fellow euro members to take
direct stakes in the banks or provide insurance against losses
for them as it tries to find buyers for lenders.  “It would be great if we could sell Bank of Ireland and
Allied Irish for a euro to an overseas buyer, but that’s not
going to happen,” said Jim Power, chief economist at Friends
First in Dublin, who likened Irish banks to Soviet-era cars. “I
compare it to trying to sell a 20-year-old Lada.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
