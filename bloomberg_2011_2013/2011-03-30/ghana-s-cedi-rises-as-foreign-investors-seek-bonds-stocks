Ghana ’s cedi strengthened against
the dollar after foreigners sold foreign currency to buy
Ghanaian bonds and equities.  The currency traded at 1.5265 per dollar at 1:51 p.m. in
Accra, from 1.5290 yesterday, according to data from Standard
Bank Group Ltd.  “Some offshore investors are selling the dollar to
purchase a bond on the secondary market or maybe some
equities,” said Chris Nettey, a currency trader with the Accra
office of the lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
