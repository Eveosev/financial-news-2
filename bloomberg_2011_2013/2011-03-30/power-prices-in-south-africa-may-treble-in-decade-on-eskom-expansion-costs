South African electricity prices
may almost treble in a decade as state-run Eskom Holdings Ltd.,
supplier of 95 percent of all power to  Africa ’s biggest economy,
spends billions of dollars to help shrink a capacity shortage.  The average price may increase to as much as 1.12 rand a
kilowatt-hour by 2021 from 41 cents last year, according to a
20-year  power plan  published this week on the Department of
Energy’s website. The estimate includes this year’s 26 percent
expansion in charges, following a 25 percent gain last year.  The Integrated Resource Plan seeks to add a further 9,600
megawatts of nuclear power, 6,300 megawatts of coal-fired power
and 17,800 megawatts of renewable energy to current capacity of
43,895 megawatts by 2030, on top of earlier expansion proposals.
It will be revised at least every two years.  A shortage of capacity prompted temporary shutdowns of
mines and rolling blackouts across the country in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
