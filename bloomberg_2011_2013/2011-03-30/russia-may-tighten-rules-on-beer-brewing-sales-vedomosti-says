Russia  may tighten rules on the
production and sale of alcoholic beverages, Vedomosti reported,
citing draft amendments to the law.  Brewing and selling beer may be licensed and regional
administrations may have the power to ban beer sales at night,
the newspaper said.  Some members of the State Duma committee that will discuss
the document today suggest that beer should be legally equated
with strong alcoholic drinks such as vodka, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Yuliya
