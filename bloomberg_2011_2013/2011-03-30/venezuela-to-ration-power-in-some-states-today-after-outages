Venezuela  will ration electricity
in some states today after a power plant in western Zulia state
went offline yesterday, causing outages, Vice President Elias Jaua said.  The government will use gasoil to get the Termozulia plant
running again after gas shipments through a Colombian pipeline
were interrupted, Jaua said on national television last night.
Several states suffered outages yesterday, according to Jaua. He
didn’t say which states would have their power rationed today.  Venezuela will also look into the cause of outages in the
country’s Andean states yesterday, especially Tachira, Jaua said,
adding that the outages weren’t related to Termozulia. Ninety
percent of power supply in the Andres has been restored, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
