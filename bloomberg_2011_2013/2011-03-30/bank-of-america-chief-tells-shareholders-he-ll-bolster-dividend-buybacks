Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, “is much stronger today than it was a
year ago” and expects to bolster dividends and stock buybacks,
said Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan .  The bank plans “to put in place a prudent
capital management strategy in the near future that, pending
regulatory approvals, includes a higher dividend and stock
repurchases,” Moynihan wrote in his annual letter to
shareholders, released today on the company’s website.  The letter was dated March 15, three days before the
 Federal Reserve  rejected the company’s capital plan, which Bank
of America has vowed to resubmit. Moynihan, 51, took over as CEO
in January 2010. He spent much of his first year dealing with
the fallout from acquisitions made by his predecessor,  Kenneth
D. Lewis , that burdened the company with losses on home
mortgages and credit cards.  “While we have made progress in strengthening the balance
sheet and focusing our capital to support core capabilities for
customers, the overhang of issues related to recent acquisitions
and regulatory changes remained significant,” Moynihan wrote.
He reiterated his intent to build a company with a “fortress
balance sheet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
