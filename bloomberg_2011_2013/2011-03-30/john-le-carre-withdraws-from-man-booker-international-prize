John le Carre withdrew from the
60,000 pound ($96,250) Man Booker International Prize, saying he
doesn’t compete for literary awards.  Le Carre was tapped as one of 13 finalists, including
Philip Roth and Marilynne Robinson of the U.S. and Philip
Pullman of the U.K., who were announced in a news conference
held today at the University of Sydney.  “I am enormously flattered to be named as a finalist of
the 2011 Man Booker International Prize,” le Carre said in a
statement published on the  award’s website . “However, I do not
compete for literary prizes and have therefore asked for my name
to be withdrawn.”  First bestowed on Albanian writer Ismail Kadare in 2005,
Man Booker International Prize is awarded every two years to
recognize a living author’s achievement in fiction and literary
excellence.  The chairman of the judging panel, Rick Gekoski, voiced
disappointment at le Carre’s request and said his name would
remain on the list.  In addition to le Carre, Pullman, Robinson and Roth, the
finalists are Wang Anyi of  China ; Juan Goytisolo of Spain; James
Kelman of the U.K.; Amin Maalouf of Lebanon; David Malouf of
Australia; Dacia Maraini of Italy; Rohinton Mistry of
 India /Canada); Su Tong of China; and Anne Tyler of the U.S., the
organizers said.  The winner will be announced at the  Sydney Writers’
Festival  on May 18. The contest is sponsored by hedge-fund
manager  Man Group Plc (EMG) , which also funds the Man  Booker Prize  for
Fiction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
