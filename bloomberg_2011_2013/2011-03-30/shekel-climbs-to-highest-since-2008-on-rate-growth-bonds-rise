The shekel rose to the highest
level in more than two years after the biggest increase in
 Israel ’s lending rate since 2005 and as the central bank raised
its growth forecast.  Government bonds  rose.  The  Bank of Israel  today revised its growth forecast for
this year to 4.5 percent from 3.8 percent. The economy is
expected to expand 4 percent in 2012. Governor  Stanley Fischer 
lifted the interest rate a half-percentage point to 3 percent
March 28, the highest since November 2008, as inflation
accelerated and growth surged.  “The large rate increase is driving shekel strength,” Tom
Gerszbejn, a trader at Union Bank of Israel Ltd. in Tel Aviv,
said by telephone today. “Foreign investors are selling dollars
and buying shekels, taking advantage of the widening rate
differential with the U.S.”  Near-zero  interest rates  in the U.S. and  Europe  have
triggered inflows into Israel and other countries where rates
are higher, driving gains in currencies and undermining exports.
Fischer until this week had kept the pace of rate increases
gradual even as growth picked up, aiming to moderate shekel
gains and help exporters compete in world markets.  Central Bank Intervention  The shekel climbed as much as 0.7 percent to 3.5015 per
dollar, the highest level since October 2008. The currency,
which has gained 5.9 percent over the past year, strengthened
0.6 percent to 3.5053 at 5:16 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  At these levels, “we can expect the central bank to
intervene in the market to weaken the currency,” Gerszbejn
said. The central bank will intervene if the shekel rate is out
of balance, Fischer said at a Jerusalem conference today. He has
purchased foreign currency since March 2008 to moderate shekel
gains more than doubling foreign-currency reserves to a record
$73.8 billion at the end of February.  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 rose,
pushing the yield down 1 basis point to 5.32 percent at the 4:30
p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . The yield has gained 63 basis points
this quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
