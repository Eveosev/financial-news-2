Germany ’s Dortmund-Ems canal, which
connects the port of Bremen to the Rhine River, is closed to
barge traffic for a second day after a fire near BP Plc’s Lingen
oil refinery.  The clean-up of the incident site isn’t yet complete,
Bernhard Hermes, a spokesman for the local shipping office, said
from Meppen, Germany. The canal may open tomorrow.  A barge being filled with gasoline from the refinery caught
fire at a loading bay close to the refinery on March 28 and
sank. The refinery is operating normally, BP said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
