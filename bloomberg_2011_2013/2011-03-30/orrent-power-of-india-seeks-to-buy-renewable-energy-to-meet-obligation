Torrent Power Ltd. ,  India ’s fifth-
largest non-state generator, is seeking to buy  renewable energy 
to meet a government-set target for clean power.  The company intends to buy power on a long-term basis from
renewable sources including wind, bagasse, biomass and small
hydroelectric plants, it said in a tender notice published in
today’s Economic Times.  Torrent Power, which has an installed generation capacity
of 1,648 megawatts, also distributes power in the northwestern
state of Gujarat.  For the financial year beginning April 1, the state
electricity regulator requires that distribution utilities
purchase  6 percent  of their power from clean sources, according
to an order posted on the website of the Gujarat Electricity
Regulatory Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
