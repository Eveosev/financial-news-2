Lyceum Capital Partners LLP, a U.K.
private-equity firm, has bought a controlling stake in Eat Ltd.,
a chain of takeaway sandwich, soup and salad shops, the
Financial Times reported, citing Lyceum Chairman Philip Buscombe.  The value of the transaction wasn’t disclosed, though
Buscombe described it as “a substantial number of tens of
millions” of pounds, the newspaper said.  Eat has at present 110 outlets and the aim is to triple
that; Niall and Faith MacArthur, who started the business, will
continue to help with management and retain “a substantial
shareholding,” the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
