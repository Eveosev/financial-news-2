English charities are experiencing
a financial squeeze, the Financial Times reported, citing a
quarterly survey by the National Council for Voluntary
Organizations.  Forty-nine percent of charities are likely to cut staff and
35 percent say theyâ€™ll be unable to provide the same level of
service in the coming months; the proportion expecting to suffer
in the next 12 months has risen from 61 percent to 64 percent in
the past quarter, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
