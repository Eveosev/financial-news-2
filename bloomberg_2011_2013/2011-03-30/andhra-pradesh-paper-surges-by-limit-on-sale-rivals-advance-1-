     March 30 (Bloomberg) -- Andhra Pradesh Paper Mills (APPM)  Ltd.
surged by the daily limit in  Mumbai , sparking a rally in its
domestic rivals, after  International Paper Co. (IP)  agreed to pay
more than twice the market price to buy the Indian company.  The world’s top paper producer will buy 53.5 percent for
$257 million, or 544 rupees a share, and make an offer for 21.5
percent, spending a total $361 million. Andhra Pradesh Paper
closed at 197.5 rupees before the announcement yesterday.  International Paper is making the acquisition to benefit
from growth in  India  and as consumption in the U.S. and other
regions declines, Paul Brown, Asia president, told reporters in
Mumbai after trading ended yesterday. Demand may increase 57
percent to 14 million metric tons by 2015, according to the
Indian Paper Manufacturers Association.  “The only way to grow in this industry is through mergers
and acquisition because capacity takes time to set up,” said
Kishor Ostwal, managing director of CNI Research (India) Ltd., a
publicly traded equities research provider in Mumbai. “The deal
with Andhra Pradesh Paper has set a benchmark in a booming
industry. Paper mills will now get better valuations.”  Andhra Pradesh Paper surged 20 percent to 236.95 rupees, a
record close and the best performer on the  BSE Small-Cap Index. (BSESMCAP) 
Ballarpur Industries Ltd., India’s biggest paper maker, surged
by the daily 20 percent limit before closing 17 percent higher
at 37.60 rupees, the steepest advance since April. JK Paper Ltd.
rallied 20 percent to 57.8 rupees. The nation’s seven paper
mills still trade at an average 7 times earnings, compared with
10 times for the small-cap gauge, according to Bloomberg data.  Paying Premium  Andhra Pradesh Paper, India’s fifth-biggest producer with a
capacity of 250,000 tons, posted profit of 542 million rupees
($11.4 million) in the year ended March 31, 2010, more than
double from a year ago. Net debt was 4.7 billion rupees, about
half the current market value, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  International Paper’s total acquisition cost is 32 times
Andhra Pradesh Paper’s 2010 net income and about 30 percent of
the combined market value of its six rivals.  “The price we are paying is commensurate with the levels
at which deals are happening,” Brown said. “We are focusing
more on the opportunity that we are getting.”  International Paper owns and operates plants in the U.S.,
 Russia ,  Morocco  and  Turkey . It paid $200 million in June for
Svenska Cellulosa AB’s Asian packaging business. It may consider
opportunities to expand in Eastern Europe and  China  where it
sees greater profitability, Chief Executive Officer John Faraci
said on Feb. 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
