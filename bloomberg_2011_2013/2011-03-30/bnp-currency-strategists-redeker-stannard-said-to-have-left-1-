Hans-Guenter Redeker, BNP Paribas
SA’s global head of foreign-exchange strategy in  London , is
leaving the bank, according to four people with knowledge of the
matter.  Ian Stannard , London-based senior currency strategist, is
also going, said the people, who declined to be identified
because they’re not authorized to discuss the departures.  Redeker and Stannard joined BNP together in November 2000
from Chase Manhattan Bank in London. Redeker, a German national,
had been with Chase Manhattan since 1987 while Stannard joined
the lender, now part of JPMorgan, in 1990.  Ilias Catsaros, a BNP Paribas spokesman in Paris, declined
to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. Redeker would not
comment when contacted by telephone while Stannard couldn’t be
reached.  To contact the reporters on this story:
