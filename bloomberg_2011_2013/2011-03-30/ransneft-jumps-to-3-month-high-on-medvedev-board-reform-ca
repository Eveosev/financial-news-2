OAO Transneft climbed to the
highest level in more than three months after Russian President
 Dmitry Medvedev  called for independent directors to replace
government officials on state companies’ boards.  The shares of  Russia ’s oil pipeline operator extended gains
after Medvedev’s comments, rising 3.5 percent to 41,205 rubles
by 6:45 p.m. in Moscow, their strongest close since Dec. 22.  The board changes should be made by mid-year, Medvedev said
at a government meeting on modernizing the economy in
Magnitogorsk today.  “This is a large step in the right direction,” said Jacob
Grapengiesser, a  fund manager  at East Capital, which holds
Transneft shares and has more than $4 billion in assets under
management. East Capital, along with minority stakeholders
Prosperity Capital and Baring Vostok, have sought corporate
governance improvements at Transneft.  “Judging by media reports of the President’s speech, he
was talking about state involvement in competing companies,”
Igor Dyomin, a spokesman for Transneft said by telephone from
Moscow. “Transneft is a monopoly, so it’s different.”  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  called on Dec. 30 for an
investigation into allegations of a $4 billion fraud during
construction of an oil pipeline across eastern Siberia involving
Transneft. The claims were published by Alexey Navalny, a
Moscow-based lawyer who owns stock in the monopoly, on a website
he set up to expose Russian government contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
