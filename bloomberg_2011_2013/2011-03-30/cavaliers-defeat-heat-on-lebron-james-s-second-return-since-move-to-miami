The  Cleveland Cavaliers  recovered
after giving up a 23-point second-half lead to beat the  Miami
Heat  for the first time in four attempts since  LeBron James  left
for  Florida .  The Cavaliers ended Miami’s run of five straight wins,
sending the Heat to their second defeat in 10 National
Basketball Association games with a 102-90 victory at the
Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland last night.  “We got exactly what we deserved,” Miami coach Erik Spoelstra told reporters. “They played harder than we did.”  James had 27 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists for the
Heat.  J.J. Hickson scored 21 points for Cleveland as the
Cavaliers made 56 percent of their field goal attempts to win
for the fourth time in 14 games this month. Anthony Parker added
20 points for the home team.  Miami leads the Southeast Division in the Eastern
Conference by four games over the  Orlando Magic  and has already
clinched a playoff spot. The Heat have the sixth-best record in
the league at 51-23, while Cleveland, which lost a record 26
straight games earlier this season, is last in the NBA with a
15-58 mark.  Miami routed Cleveland 118-90 on Dec. 2 in James’s return
to the city where he spent seven seasons before leaving as a
free agent in July. The result “left a bad taste in my mouth,”
Cavaliers coach Byron Scott told reporters.  “They embarrassed us, and I was still a little ticked off
by what happened,” Scott said. “This was a great win.”  23-Point Lead  Last night, the Cavaliers held a 53-42 advantage at
halftime and led 71-48 with 4 minutes, 45 seconds to play in the
third quarter.  Miami tied it 83-83 with 7:01 to play in the game and
didn’t score again until 2:38 remained, as the Cavaliers took a
95-83 lead.  Two-time reigning NBA Most Valuable Player James scored the
final seven points for the Heat.  Dwyane Wade  had 24 points and
Mike Bibby added 23 for Miami.  Chris Bosh  was limited to 10
points, going 5-for-14 on field goal attempts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
