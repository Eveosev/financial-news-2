The Bovespa stock index advanced
for a second day on speculation  Brazil ’s central bank will limit
further interest rate increases after policy makers said the
costs are too high to meet the inflation target this year.  Retailer B2W Cia. Global do Varejo led gains for companies
that depend on domestic demand. Homebuilder  Brookfield
Incorporacoes SA (BISA3)  rose after it said fourth-quarter net income
climbed to 84.9 million reais ($51.7 million) from 51.6 million
reais a year earlier.  Bovespa climbed 0.5 percent to 67,803.91 at 10:04 a.m. New
York time. Fifty-one stocks rose on the index, while 15 fell.
The measure is down 2 percent this quarter, the biggest three-
month decline since the three months ended June 30. The real
strengthened 0.2 percent to 1.6428 per  U.S. dollar  and interest
rate futures yields for 2011 declined.  Policy makers forecast consumer prices will rise 5.6
percent in 2011 and 4.6 percent in 2012 should the benchmark
interest rate remain unchanged at 11.75 percent, according to
the quarterly inflation report published today.  Brazil’s monthly inflation, as measured by the IGP-M  price
index , slowed to 0.62 percent in March from 1 percent in
February, the Getulio Vargas Foundation said. This compares with
the median 0.69 percent forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 28
analysts.  B2W advanced 2.7 percent to 22.70 reais. Brookfield gained
1.6 percent to 8.23 reais.  The Bovespa has retreated this year as homebuilders and
banks fell on concern faster inflation will limit growth,
outweighing gains in oil and steel producers. The index trades
at 10.7 times analysts’ earnings estimates, according to weekly
data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of 14 for
the Shanghai Composite Index, 7.5 for Russia’s Micex, and 17.8
for  India ’s Sensex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
