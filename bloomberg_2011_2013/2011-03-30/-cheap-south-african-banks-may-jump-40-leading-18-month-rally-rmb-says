Banks will lead a rally in South
African stocks that may last 18 months as record-low U.S.
interest rates spur emerging-market gains, according to RMB
Asset Management, one of the nation’s three biggest fund
managers.  Lenders may jump 40 percent because valuations as low as 10
times annual earnings compare with multiples of 15 for the
FTSE/JSE All Share Index, according to RMB.  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , the
second-largest South African lender by market value, trades at
10.2 times earnings, compared with 13.9 for the MSCI Emerging
Markets/ Financials index, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
stock gained the most since December today.  “Banks are truly cheap at the current valuations,” Wayne McCurrie, a portfolio manager who helps oversee 110 billion rand
($16 billion) at the Johannesburg-based company, said in an
interview in Johannesburg yesterday. Stock gains will be spurred
by earnings growth of as much as 30 percent, he said.  Africa’s biggest stock gauge may climb 10 to 15 percent
over the next year-and-a-half as the global economic recovery
boosts corporate earnings while the  Federal Reserve  avoids
tightening monetary policy, McCurrie said.  RMB’s outlook contrasts with a more bearish view from
Investec Asset Management,  South Africa ’s biggest independent
money manager. South Africa’s stocks are “significantly
overvalued” as the surge in metals prices in the past two years
boosted Anglo American Plc and BHP Billiton Plc, Sam Houlie, who
oversees about 120 billion rand ($17.5 billion) as head of South
African equities at Investec, said on March 25 in  Cape Town .  Household Debt   FirstRand’s shares jumped the most since Dec. 6, rising 3.2
percent to close at 19.90 rand in Johannesburg, while Absa Bank
climbed 2 percent to close at 137.25 rand, the highest since
Jan. 26. Standard Bank Group Ltd., Africa’s largest retail bank
by assets, advanced 2.3 percent to 104.75 rand, the highest
closing level since Feb. 4.  FirstRand, based in Johannesburg, has tumbled 8 percent
from its peak on Jan. 13 and  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) , the biggest retail
lender, has dropped 5 percent to value its shares at 11.98 times
annual earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Johannesburg-
based Absa’s bad debt, which rose almost fourfold between 2007
and 2009, fell 33 percent to 6 billion rand last year, the bank
said in a statement last month.  Growth in borrowing by South African households has slowed
to 5 percent from as much as 27 percent in 2006 as the country
recovered from the 2009 recession. The nation’s benchmark
interest rate of 5.5 percent, the lowest in 30 years, and an
inflation rate of 3.7 percent, 50 basis points above the slowest
pace in 5 1/2 years, will boost prospects for increased lending
by banks, according to McCurrie.  Bad Debt Unwinding  Standard Bank Group Ltd.,  Africa ’s biggest lender, said its
personal and business unit returned to profitability and
registered a 5 percent advance in new mortgages for the year
through December. The Johannesburg-based company has gained 7.8
percent since March 15, lifting its valuation to 13.9 times
annual earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “There’s huge bad debt unwinding in the banking sector and
that’s why we think the banks will rise,” said McCurrie.  Share gains will be spurred by company earnings growing
about 30 percent next year, he said.  Anglo American, which makes up 11 percent of the All Share
index, has lost 11 percent since Feb. 15 as metal prices fell on
concern  Japan ’s earthquake would stem demand. The London-based
company’s stock is valued at 9.1 times earnings, while BHP, the
world’s biggest mining company that comprises 13 percent of the
index, is trading for a price-to-earnings multiple of 12.5.  Commodity shares “are very good, but the shares aren’t
cheap,” McCurrie said, adding RMB isn’t buying diversified
base-metals producers including Anglo American and Melbourne-
based BHP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
