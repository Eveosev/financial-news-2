Canadian stocks rose, extending a
third-straight quarterly gain, as oil advanced the day before
the U.S. March employment report and gold climbed after European
inflation exceeded most economists’ forecasts.  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) , the maker of trains and airplanes, jumped
13 percent after reporting earnings that topped the average of
20 analyst estimates by 43 percent, excluding certain items.
 Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Canada ’s largest oil and gas producer,
increased 1.3 percent as oil rose on concern the Libyan conflict
will cut production. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. rallied
1.1 percent after the U.S. reported smaller corn inventories
than most analysts had estimated.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index climbed 54.16
points, or 0.4 percent, to 14,137.74 at 1:50 p.m. in Toronto.  “Oil’s up because people are expecting good jobs
numbers,” said Paul Ma, who manages C$500 million ($514
million) as a money manager at McLean & Partners in Calgary.
“Economic growth is up, people drive more cars. Gold is up
because of inflation. When there’s inflation, where do people
go? Gold.”  The index had gained 4.8 percent this quarter through
yesterday as the Canadian and U.S. economies expanded and  oil
prices  surged 14 percent on unrest in the Middle East. If the
equity benchmark closes above 14,136.50, it will complete its
ninth-straight monthly advance, the longest streak in 27 years.  Train Contract  In addition to reporting its biggest quarterly profit in
two years, Bombardier said today it won a A$269 million ($278
million) train contract from the government of South Australia.  Shares of the Montreal-based company rose 13 percent to a
30-month high of C$7.15.  Crude increased as much as 2.4 percent. Suncor climbed 1.3
percent to C$43.94.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , which
produces oil in  Colombia , advanced for the first time in eight
days, rallying 2.2 percent to C$26.44.  Bankers Petroleum Ltd. (BNK) , which produces oil and gas in
Albania, surged 7.8 percent to C$8.75 after agreeing to pay
Albpetrol Sh.A. $34 million to take over 140 wells.  Precious-metals producers climbed after the European Union
said consumer prices rose the most in more than two years in
March. Bond yields increased in Ireland,  Spain ,  Portugal  and
 Greece .  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest gold producer,
gained 0.9 percent to C$50.55.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the No. 2 producer
of the metal by market value, advanced 1.1 percent to C$48.64.
 Rubicon Minerals Corp. (RMX) , which explores for gold in Ontario,
soared 15 percent to C$5.01 after releasing a resource estimate.  Production Forecast  Osisko Mining Corp. (OSK) , which is developing a gold project in
 Quebec , dropped 3.5 percent to C$14.01 after saying 2011-12
production may be lower than it previously forecast.  Potash Corp., the world’s largest fertilizer producer, and
 Agrium Inc. (AGU)  rose after the U.S. Agriculture Department said corn
stocks fell 15 percent from a year earlier.  Potash Corp. gained 1.1 percent to C$57.19. Agrium Inc.,
Canada’s second-largest fertilizer producer, advanced 3.1
percent to C$89.71.  Central banks’ asset-purchasing programs, known as
quantitative easing, were the stimulus for the S&P/TSX’s streak
of increases, Ma said.  “Quantitative easing, whether from  Japan , from  Europe ,
from  London  or from the Fed, 100 percent of the time lifts the
market up,” he said. When the Fed announced a second round of
easing in November, “we put all our money in. We went pedal to
the metal.”  To contact the reporter on this story;
