A U.S. Department of Agriculture
 stockpile report  due tomorrow may show inventories dropped for
corn while increasing for soybeans and wheat, said Alexander Bos, an analyst at  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)  in London.  Corn stockpiles probably fell 13 percent from a year
earlier to 6.70 billion bushels as of March 1, Bos said in a
report today. Soybean inventories may have gained 1.7 percent to
1.29 billion bushels and wheat supplies likely increased 2.6
percent to 1.39 billion bushels, according to the report.  “Although we think there has been little demand rationing
seen in the corn market, both soybeans and wheat have
experienced relatively lax demand fundamentals throughout the
past few months,” Bos said.  The quarterly report is set for release tomorrow at 8:30
a.m. in  Washington .  “We think this set the stage for a bearish quarterly
stocks report for wheat and soybeans, while corn demand appears
as strong as ever due to higher energy prices and strong
livestock profitability,” Bos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
