University of Michigan  football
coach Brady Hoke completed a six-year contract that will pay him
an average annual salary of $3.25 million, the  Associated Press 
reported‘.  Hoke, a former Wolverines assistant, was hired in January
to succeed Rich Rodriguez, who was fired after three seasons and
a 15-22 record. Hoke had a 47-49 record at San Diego State and
Ball State before taking over at Michigan, whose 884 wins are
the most in college football history.  Hoke will make $2 million this year and his base salary
will increase by $100,000 each season, the AP said, citing
Athletic Director Dave Brandon. Hoke can also earn bonuses of
$1.5 million in his third and sixth seasons.  Michigan  spokesman
Dave Ablauf said in an e-mail that he couldn’t confirm the terms
of Hoke’s contract.  Rodriguez was fired with three years left on a six-year
deal that paid him about $2.5 million a season. The Wolverines
went 7-6 last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
