Siemens AG (SIE)  Chief Executive Officer
 Peter Loescher  would consider making an acquisition for billions
of euros,  Handelsblatt said , citing an interview with the
manager.  Any purchase won’t be as big as the company’s sale of the
VDO automotive division, which it sold for 11 billion euros
($15.5 billion), Loescher said, according to the German
newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
