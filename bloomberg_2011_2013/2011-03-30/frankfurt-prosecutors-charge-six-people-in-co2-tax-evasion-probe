Frankfurt prosecutors charged six
company managers, five of whom are in custody, as part of a
Europe-wide crackdown on emissions-related  tax fraud .  The suspects, aged 27 years to 65 years, are accused of
taking part in  tax evasion  that led to 230 million euros ($324
million) in damages, prosecutor Guenter Wittig said in an e-
mailed statement today. The suspects are from Germany, France
and the U.K.  German authorizes enlisted assistance from nine countries
last year as it cracked down on tax fraud in the carbon-permit
market after  Europe  started its cap-and-trade system in 2005.
Frankfurt prosecutors estimate that German tax authorities lost
a total 850 million euros in the scheme.  Seven  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  employees are among 170 people who
are still being investigated, Wittig said in the statement.
Deutsche Bank spokesman Christian Streckert declined to comment.  The Frankfurt-based bank said earlier this month that a
review of the allegations conducted by a law firm didnâ€™t turn up
any evidence of wrongdoing.  The suspects charged are managing directors of various
companies that made wrong statements to tax authorities, taking
advantage of a rule in German tax law that was repealed in June
of last year, Wittig said. Prosecutors have frozen about 100
million euros in the probe that may be confiscated by tax
authorities, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
