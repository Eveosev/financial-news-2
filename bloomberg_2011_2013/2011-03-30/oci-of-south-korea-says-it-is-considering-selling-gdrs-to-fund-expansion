OCI Co., the world’s second-largest
polysilicon maker, said it may sell global depositary receipts
to raise funds for expansion.  Selling depositary receipts is one funding option and no
decision has been made, the Seoul-based company said in a
regulatory filing.  The solar-component maker may sell $500 million of global
depositary receipts, MoneyToday reported today, citing an
industry official that it didn’t identify. Shares of OCI gained
1.3 percent to close at 493,000 won in Seoul trading, the
highest since they were listed.  OCI is expanding its annual output capacity of the material
used to make solar cells to 62,000 metric tons by 2012 from the
current 27,000 tons. The polysilicon maker won more than $3.2
billion of orders from Neo Solar Power Co., Suntech Power
International Ltd. and other overseas companies, according to
filings this month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
