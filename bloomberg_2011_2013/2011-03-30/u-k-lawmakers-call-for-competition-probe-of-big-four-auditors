U.K. lawmakers called for a
competition inquiry into the “Big Four” auditors, saying their
domination of the market limits choice and that those auditing
banks failed to alert regulators to the buildup of risky assets.  The U.K., as a financial center, should take a lead in
looking at the workings of  Deloitte & Touche LLP , Ernst & Young
LLP, KPMG LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the House of Lords
Economic Affairs Committee said in a report published in London
today. These firms audit 99 of the 100 largest U.K. companies.  As well as raising the possibility that the withdrawal of
one of them from auditing would further hurt competition, the
committee said the three firms involved in bank audit -- which
Ernst & Young doesn’t offer in the U.K. -- were guilty of a
“dereliction of duty” in failing to meet with regulators to
discuss their clients’ stability. It said such meetings should
be mandatory in future.  “Our inquiry has revealed widespread concerns about the
Big Four’s dominance and the risk that they could become the Big
Three,” Chairman John MacGregor, a Conservative member of
Parliament’s upper house, said in an e-mailed statement.
“Equally important is our support for regular meetings between
auditors of financial institutions and regulators to avoid the
serious failures of communications between the two which were so
starkly revealed by the evidence to us and which contributed to
the financial crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
