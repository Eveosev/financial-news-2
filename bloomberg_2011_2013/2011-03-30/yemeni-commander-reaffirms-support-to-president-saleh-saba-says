The commander of  Yemen â€™s southern
military region, Mahdi Makwalah, said he continues to support
the government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, state-run Saba
news agency reported today, citing a cable sent by the commander
to the president.  Saleh dismissed Mohammed Ali Mohsen, a commander for the
eastern region, a week after he vowed to support anti-government
protesters, the defense ministry said in a statement on its
website on March 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
