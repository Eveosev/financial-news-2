President  Barack Obama , addressing
a small gathering of party donors in New York, gently nudged his
Democratic National Committee chairman,  Tim Kaine , to run for an
open Senate seat in Virginia.  “Since he happened to be a really great governor of the
commonwealth of Virginia, I suspect that, should he choose to do
so, he would also be an outstanding senator from the
commonwealth of Virginia,” Obama said, after Kaine introduced
him to an audience of 50 donors who each paid $30,800 for dinner
with the president.  Virginia Senator  Jim Webb , a Democrat who won the seat in
one of 2006’s most competitive races, said last month that he
wouldn’t seek re-election. Republican George Allen, the
incumbent senator whom Webb defeated, is already in the race, as
is Republican  Jamie Radtke , the Richmond Tea Party chairwoman.  In 2008, Obama was the first Democratic presidential
candidate to win the state since 1964. Since then, though,
voters have elected a Republican governor, Bob McDonnell, and
captured two previously Democratic House seats.  “Whatever decision he makes, I just want everyone here to
know that he has done an outstanding job for me,” Obama said at
the Red Rooster restaurant in Harlem.  The president capped a trip to New York with a couple of
Democratic Party events to raise money and thank donors. Earlier
today he dedicated a building at the U.S. mission to the United
Nations in memory of former Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown, who
was killed in a plane crash in 1996 while on a trade mission to
 Croatia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
