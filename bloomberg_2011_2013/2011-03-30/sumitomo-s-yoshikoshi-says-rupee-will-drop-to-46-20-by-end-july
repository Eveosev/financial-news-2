Tetsuo Yoshikoshi, a Singapore-
based senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.,
comments on the outlook for  India ’s rupee.  Three-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency
gained 0.2 percent to 45.48 per dollar as of 11:59 a.m. in
Singapore, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contracts reflect bets the rupee will fall 1.7 percent from the
spot rate of 44.725.  Yoshikoshi forecasts the currency will drop 3.2 percent to
46.20 by the end of July.  “The rupee will underperform in Asia because investors are
quite concerned about the political situation in India as
corruption issues are damaging. Also, a rise in  oil prices  is
also negative for the currency.”  The rupee may trade around current levels for up to a month
and “toward the end of June will start depreciating against the
 U.S. dollar ,” he said. “It’s a case of dollar strengthening.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
