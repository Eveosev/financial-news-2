South Africa ’s FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index rallied by the most since Feb. 2, rising 556.60, or
1.8 percent, to 32,274.61 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the diversified miner that
makes up 11 percent of the benchmark  stock index , climbed 4.10
rand, or 1.2 percent, to 356.10 rand, the highest since March 9,
as Credit Suisse Group AG added the company to its “conviction
ideas” list.  Anglo Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  , the largest producer of the
metal, rose 14.07 rand, or 2.1 percent, to 683.07 rand, the
highest close since March 7, after platinum snapped four days of
losses as plants resumed production in quake-hit  Japan . Nissan
Motor Co., Japan’s third-largest automaker by market value,
saying it expects factories to return to normal by the end of
June. Platinum is used to make pollution-control devices in
automobiles.  Avusa Ltd. (AVU)  , South Africa’s second-largest media
company, declined for a second day, falling 25 cents, or 1
percent, to 24.55 rand. The company has received a 2.7 billion-
rand ($393 million), or 26 rand-a-share offer from Capitau
Holdings, a private equity firm. Avusa has for two weeks not
published or commented on the offer, a development seen by some
analysts as being hostile.  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL)  , the world’s largest mining
company, increased to the highest intraday level in three weeks,
rising 5.82 rand, or 2.2 percent, to 269.72 rand. The company
said expansion at the Olympic Dam project in  Australia  would
boost annual copper output to 750,000 metric tons over 30 years
from 180,000 tons. The metal producer said the Australian
government should make a decision in the second half of the
year.  Capitec Bank Holdings Ltd. (CPI)  , a South African
lender, fell for the first day in eight, retreating 2.90 rand,
or 1.7 percent, to 167.10 rand after reporting earnings that
missed analysts’ expectations. Capitec said profit for the year
through February climbed 47 percent to 640 million rand, missing
a 652 million-rand median estimate by two analysts polled by
Bloomberg.  FirstRand Group Ltd. (FSR SJ), the second-largest South
African lender by market value, rose 3.2 percent, the most since
Dec. 6, to 19.90 rand. Banks may gain as much as 40 percent
because valuations as low as 10 times annual earnings compare
with multiples of 15 for the FTSE/JSE All Share Index, Wayne
McCurrie, a portfolio manager who helps oversee 110 billion rand
($16 billion) at RMB Asset Management, said in an interview.
FirstRand traded at 10.2 times earnings yesterday, compared with
13.9 for the MSCI Emerging Markets/ Financials index, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
