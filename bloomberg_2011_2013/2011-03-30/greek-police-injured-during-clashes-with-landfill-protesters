Greek police  said 10 officers were
injured yesterday during clashes with residents of  Keratea , 40
kilometers (25 miles) outside of  Athens , over landfill plans.  Four of the 10 injured officers were still in hospital,
according to a text message sent by police today.  Residents of Keratea, a municipality with a population of
about 11,000, have clashed with police for several weeks over a
decision by the government to construct a new landfill in the
area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
