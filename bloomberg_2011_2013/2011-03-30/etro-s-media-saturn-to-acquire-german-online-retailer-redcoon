Media-Saturn, the consumer-
electronics chain owned by  Metro AG (MEO) , said it agreed to buy
online retailer  Redcoon  to boost  internet sales .  A contract for the purchase was signed today, the
Ingolstadt, Germany-based unit of the country’s biggest retailer
said by e-mail today. Redcoon operates in 10 European countries,
including Germany, and had sales of 354 million euros ($499
million) in the last fiscal year, the statement shows.  Media-Saturn,  Europe ’s biggest consumer-electronics
retailer, has had some online operations in the Netherlands and
Austria since last year and has said repeatedly it wants to add
revenue through an online store. Redcoon is among the industry’s
“internationally leading” businesses, it said.  “Redcoon fits perfectly into the Media-Saturn portfolio,”
the Metro unit’s Chief Executive Officer Horst Norberg said in
the statement. Redcoon will operate independently from the
unit’s store-based business, he said.  Media-Saturn didn’t disclose the purchase price for
Aschaffenburg, Germany-based Redcoon. Redcoon’s CEO and founder
Reiner Heckel will keep his post, Media-Saturn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
