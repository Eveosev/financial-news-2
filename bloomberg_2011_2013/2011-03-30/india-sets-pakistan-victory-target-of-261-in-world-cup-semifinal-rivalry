Sachin Tendulkar  scored 85 as India
set archrival Pakistan a victory target of 261 in today’s
Cricket World Cup semifinal in Mohali.  Tendulkar, seeking to become the first man to hit 100
international centuries, led a charmed life before being
dismissed for 85. Wahab Riaz took 5-46 as India totaled 260-9.  Tendulkar was dropped by Misbah-ul-Haq, Younis Khan,
wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal and Umar Akmal -- three of those off
the bowling of Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi, once off Mohammad Hafeez. Tendulkar also had a leg-before-wicket verdict
overturned on video review after scoring 23, and next ball
survived a stumping appeal.  Finally, Afridi made up for his teammates’ fielding errors
by catching the “Little Master,” off Saeed Ajmal.  India , batting first after winning the toss, grabbed the
initiative immediately through opener Virender Sehwag. He lashed
the bowlers to all sides of the ground as India reached 39-0 in
four overs, 21 of those runs coming off one over bowled by  Umar Gul .  Sehwag’s explosive innings of 38 runs off 25 balls came to
an end when he was trapped leg-before-wicket by Riaz with the
score on 48. His exit slowed India’s progress.  Gautam Gambhir was stumped for 27 before Riaz inflicted a
double blow on India in consecutive balls. First he had Virat
Kohli caught, then he clean-bowled key batsman  Yuvraj Singh  with
an inswinging yorker. That left the score on 141-4.  Amid  Pakistan ’s error-strewn fielding performance,
Tendulkar approached the century mark before he finally left on
187-5. Mahendra Singh Dhoni, on 25 runs, was lbw to Riaz at 205-
6, and Harbhajan Singh was stumped for 12. Riaz took his fifth
wicket, having Zaheer Khan caught behind before Ashish Nehra was
run out.  Suresh Raina ended on 36 not out.  India and Pakistan have each won the World Cup once, in
1983 and 1992, respectively. The winner of today’s game will
play  Sri Lanka  in the final in Mumbai on April 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
