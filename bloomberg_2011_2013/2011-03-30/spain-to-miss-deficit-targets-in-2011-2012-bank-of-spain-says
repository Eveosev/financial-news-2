Spain  may miss its budget-deficit
targets in 2011 and 2012, said the Bank of Spain, which
forecasts slower growth than the government.  The country’s budget gap will amount to 6.2 percent of
gross domestic product this year and narrow to 5.2 percent in
2012, the central bank in  Madrid  said today. The  Finance
Ministry  expects 6 percent in 2011 and 4.4 percent in 2012.  Spain is implementing the deepest austerity measures in at
least three decades to rein in the euro region’s third-largest
deficit and aims to bring its shortfall in line with that of
 France  this year. The economy, weighed down by one of the
highest private-debt burdens in the region, is struggling to
emerge from an almost two-year recession prompted by the
collapse of a property boom.  The central bank sees economic growth of 0.8 percent this
year, compared with the government’s 1.3 percent forecast, and
1.5 percent in 2012, below the official estimate of 2.5 percent.
The Bank of Spain said the difference in the deficit estimates
was mainly due to its lower growth forecasts.  Unemployment, the highest in  Europe , will remain above 20
percent through 2012, the Bank of Spain said.  The gap between Spanish and German borrowing costs narrowed
to 183.7 basis points today from 187.4 basis points yesterday.
That compares with a euro-era high of 298 basis points on Nov.
30 and an average of 15 basis points in the first decade of
monetary union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
