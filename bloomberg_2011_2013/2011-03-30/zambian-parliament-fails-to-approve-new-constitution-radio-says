Zambia’s parliament failed to
approve constitutional changes that would have mandated a second
round of voting if no presidential candidate won more than 50
percent of the vote, Parliament Radio reported.  The bill won the backing of 96 out of 158 lawmakers
yesterday, below the two-third majority needed for approval, the
National Assembly’s radio station said. Seventeen lawmakers
voted against the proposals and one abstained.  The failure to approve the constitution means that
candidates in a presidential election to be held by October need
only to win more votes than any other contender to become
president. The new constitution would also have given regulators
90 days to decide on allegations of irregularities in the vote
before swearing in the new president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
