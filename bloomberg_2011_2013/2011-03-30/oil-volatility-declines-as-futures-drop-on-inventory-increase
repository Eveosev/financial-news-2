Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures prices declined after the Energy Department
reported that supplies gained more than forecast last week and
fuel demand slipped to a four-month low.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 30 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York , down
from 30.8 percent yesterday. It was 32.6 a week ago.  Oil for May delivery declined 52 cents to settle at $104.27
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  June $130 calls were the most active options in electronic
trading today, with 1,913 lots changing hands as of 4:50 p.m. in
New York. They fell 3 cents to 36 cents a barrel. May $100 puts,
the next most active contract with 1,824 contracts trading, lost
2 cents to 91 cents a barrel.  May $110 calls dropped 21 cents to 77 cents on volume of
821 contracts in electronic trading on the Nymex. One contract
covers 1,000 barrels of oil.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  June $120 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 6,395 lots changing hands. They rose 7 cents to
$1.05 a barrel. The next most active option, June $115 calls,
gained 13 cents to $1.75 a barrel on 5,214 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 39,138
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 38,927 and June
$150 calls with 38,583.  To contact the reporters on this story:
