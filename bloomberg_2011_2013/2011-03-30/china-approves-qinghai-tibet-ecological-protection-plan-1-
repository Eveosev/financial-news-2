China approved a plan to improve
the ecology and protect the environment in the Qinghai- Tibet 
Plateau region over the next three decades.  The nation aims to maintain “ecological safety” in an
area which includes the regions of Tibet and Xinjiang and the
provinces of Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Gansu, according to a
statement on the government’s website, citing a decision of a
standing committee of the State Council.  The government also selected 10 areas for additional
protection such as Sanjiangyuan and Qilianshan, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
