Private equity funds have as much
as $8 billion ready to buy stakes in Brazilian companies, Piero Minardi, a partner at  Gavea Investimentos , said at the Bloomberg
 Brazil  Economic Forum in Sao Paulo yesterday.  Minardi, who helps oversee $5 billion at the fund manager
set up by former central bank President Arminio Fraga, said more
than 3,000 companies could receive investment from private
equity funds either based in or with units in Brazil.  “The numbers are lower than those for  China , but they’re
approaching those for  India ,” Minardi said. “There are
opportunities in the most diverse sectors.”  Last year, Brazil had the largest value and number of
mergers and acquisitions in at least 12 years, driven by
economic growth of 7.5 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Latin America’s biggest economy had 482 deals in
2010, worth $146.4 billion. The country’s gross domestic product
expansion last year was the fastest since 1986.  Private equity firms raised $8.1 billion for investment
across Latin America in 2010, according to  Latin America Venture
Capital Association . The amount was more than double that raised
in 2009, according to LAVCA, as the association is known.  To contact the reporter on this story:
