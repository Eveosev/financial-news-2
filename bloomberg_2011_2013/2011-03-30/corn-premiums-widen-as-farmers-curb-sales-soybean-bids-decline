Cash premiums for corn shipped this
month to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to Chicago
futures because lower prices curbed sales by farmers as export
demand gained. The soybean basis fell on reduced demand.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month at  Gulf of Mexico  ports was 50 cents to 55 cents a bushel
above May futures, compared with 50 cents to 51 cents yesterday,
U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show. The soybean basis fell
to 45 cents to 70 cents from 56 cents to 70 cents a bushel.  “Corn export shipments are improving, and falling futures
prices have shut off farmer selling,” said Brian Basting, a
market analyst for Advance Trading Inc. in Bloomington,
 Illinois . “Brazil farmers are harvesting a record crop and that
is slowing demand for U.S. soybean exports.”  Corn futures for May delivery fell 8.5 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $6.6325 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price touched $6.60, the lowest since March 18.  Soybean futures for May delivery gained 10.5 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $13.72 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
