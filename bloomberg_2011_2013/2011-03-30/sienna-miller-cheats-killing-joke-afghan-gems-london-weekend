Post-punk band Killing Joke will
bring its aggressive musical attack to the Royal Festival Hall
on Friday.  The group will kickstart the weekend with raging tracks
such as “Wardance,” “Love Like Blood” and “Eighties.”  For more 1980s nostalgia, Gary Numan plays the  Troxy  on
Saturday, and Big Audio Dynamite performs at  O2 Shepherd’s Bush
Empire  on April 2 and 3.  Information:  http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk  or call
+44-844-875-0073.  While the streets around Troxy aren’t great for dining, the
popular Lahore Kebab House is less than a mile down the
Commercial Road. Lahore serves authentic Pakistani dishes and
attracts fans from around London. It’s inexpensive and you can
bring your own alcohol. To avoid lining up, book ahead.  Information:  http://www.lahore-kebabhouse.com/  or

blew up 1,500-year-old Buddhas carved into the Afghan cliffs.  Another victim of the Taliban wreckball is now on view at
the  British Museum : the 2,100-year-old stele of a Hellenic
youth, cloaked and headless. The alabaster figure was smashed,
and its head, unlike the rest, could not be restored.  Other treasures shielded from Taliban rage eloquently
narrate the country’s checkered heritage. See the 2,000-year-old
gold crown of a nomadic woman -- collapsible and easy to pack.
It was found by Soviet archaeologists in 1978.  “ Afghanistan : Crossroads of the Ancient World” ends July
3. Information:  http://www.britishmuseum.org  or call
+44-20-7323-8299.  Saturday Night  Sienna Miller is trapped in a  love triangle .  In “Flare Path,” she plays the actress Patricia -- wife
of Royal Air Force pilot Teddy Graham, and lover of Hollywood
actor Peter Kyle. The play by Terence Rattigan is set in World
War II.  As Patricia plots to run off with her beau, her stiff-
lipped spouse suddenly shows his vulnerable side. Flight
Lieutenant Graham (Harry Hadden-Paton) is, in fact, sick to the
stomach before each bombing sortie, and needs her support.  “Flare Path” ends June 4 at the Theatre Royal Haymarket.

and H.G. Wells among its past clientele, and the fictional Dr.
Watson visited before meeting  Sherlock Holmes . Many current
customers are tourists. The food isn’t bad and the over-the-top
opulence of the dining room is another reason to go.

wrap up your weekend in the capital.  City Jogging Tours  offer a half-dozen routes for exploring
London in your running shoes. Casual joggers can opt for the 7-
kilometer trot along the river. Seasoned runners can brave the
hills of Hampstead Heath. The reward for that 10-kilometer
challenge: glorious panoramic views.  Information:  http://www.cityjoggingtours.co.uk  or call
