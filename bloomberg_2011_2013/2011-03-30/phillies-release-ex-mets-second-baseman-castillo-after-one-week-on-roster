The  Philadelphia Phillies  released
former New York Mets second baseman Luis Castillo about a week
after signing him to a minor-league contract, the team said.  Castillo, 35, was cut by the Mets this month, and the New
York club still owes him the $6 million remaining on his
contract. The three-time All-Star batted .235 for the Mets last
season. The Phillies signed him March 21.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
