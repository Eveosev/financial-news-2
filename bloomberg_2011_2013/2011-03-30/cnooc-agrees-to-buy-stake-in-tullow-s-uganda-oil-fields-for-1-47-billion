Cnooc Ltd. (883)  and  Total SA (FP)  signed
agreements to buy stakes in  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) ’s Ugandan exploration
interests, two weeks after the African nation said it settled a
tax dispute with the U.K. energy producer.  Cnooc will pay $1.467 billion for a one-third stake in
Exploration Areas 1, 2 and 3A in the Lake Albert Rift Basin,
according to a statement today by the Hong Kong-listed unit of
 China ’s biggest offshore oil and gas explorer. France’s Total
will also buy a one-third stake in the three areas, Cnooc said.
Tullow will get $2.9 billion from the sale, the U.K. company
said in a separate statement.  The Ugandan government said March 15 it signed a memorandum
of understanding with Tullow under which the U.K. explorer would
settle taxes, clearing the way for a partnership with Cnooc and
Total. London-based Tullow last year paid about $1.5 billion to
Heritage Oil for its interests in Block 1 and 3A in the Lake
Albert basin.  Uganda  withheld approval until the issue of
capital gains tax was resolved.  Cnooc’s transaction is expected to be completed in the
first half of 2011, subject to approval by the Ugandan and
Chinese government and regulators, the Beijing-based company
said. Oil production across the basin is expected to exceed
200,000 barrels per day eventually, Cnooc said.  Tullow shares suffered their steepest one-day loss in two
months on March 9 after the company reported “slower progress’
in ending the dispute in Uganda. The stock closed 1.9 percent
higher at 1,444 pence in  London  yesterday.  Cnooc shares rose 2.1 percent to HK$19.42 in Hong Kong at
1.57 p.m. local time, while Total shares were 0.4 percent higher
at 42.755 euros at the close yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
