Benin’s Constitutional Court
confirmed President Thomas Boni Yayi as the winner of an
election on March 13, rejecting complaints lodged by the
opposition.  The allegations of fraud and irregularities were too minor
to affect the overall result, Robert Dossou, head of the court,
told reporters in the commercial capital, Cotonou, today.  “The court declared President Boni Yayi won a second term
in office in the first-round election with more than 53 percent
of the vote,” Dossou said. “He will publicly take an oath
before members of parliament on April 6.”  Opposition leader Adrien Houngbedji obtained 36 percent of
the vote in the election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
