The pound rose against the dollar
and euro and gilts declined after U.K. data showed services
companies grew the most in almost nine years in January.  Sterling rose 0.4 percent to $1.6068, a three-day high, as
of 9:37 a.m. in  London  and strengthened 0.4 percent to 87.82
pence per euro.  The yield on the 10-year gilt rose five basis points to
3.68 percent, the highest since March 9.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
