The yen traded within 0.5 percent
of a 10-month low against the euro before reports that
economists said will show labor markets in  Germany  and the U.S.
improved, sapping demand for safer assets.  Japan’s currency headed for a quarterly drop as Asian
stocks rose and a government report showed the nation’s
investors bought the most foreign bonds in six months.
 Australia ’s dollar touched a record after retail sales grew more
than estimated, outweighing an unexpected drop in building
approvals.  South Korea ’s won strengthened as signs the U.S.
recovery is gaining momentum brightened the outlook for exports.  “We suspect the backdrop of buoyant risk appetite and
upbeat equity market sentiment will keep safe-haven currencies
like the yen under downward pressure,” said  Mike Jones , a
foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of New Zealand Ltd. in
Wellington. “Widening interest-rate differentials are also
weighing on the yen.”  The yen traded at 116.96 per euro as of 12:39 p.m. in Tokyo
from 117.10 in  New York  yesterday after falling to 117.54, the
lowest since May 13. Japan’s currency traded at 82.83 per dollar
from 82.89 after dropping to 83.21, the weakest since March 11
when Japan was struck by a magnitude-9.0 earthquake. The euro
bought $1.4134 from $1.4127.  Quarterly Drop  Japan’s currency fell 5.9 percent in the past three months,
the second-biggest decline among the 10 most-widely traded
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares rose 0.1 percent after the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.7 percent yesterday.  Germany’s unemployment rate dropped to 7.2 percent in March,
the lowest since Bloomberg started compiling the data in
December 1991, according a Bloomberg survey before today’s
report. Claims for initial  unemployment benefits  in the U.S.
fell for a third week, another survey of economists showed ahead
of the Labor Department data today.  Japanese investors bought 973.3 billion yen ($11.8 billion)
more overseas bonds and notes than they sold last week, the most
since September, Ministry of Finance data showed today.  The euro held onto yesterday’s gain against the yen on
speculation the  European Central Bank  will raise  interest rates 
at its next meeting. The ECB will increase its main refinancing
rate by a quarter-percentage point to 1.25 percent on April 7,
according to economists.  ‘Buy the Rumor’  “The euro is likely to be strong,” said  Yuji Saito ,
director of the foreign-exchange department at Credit Agricole
Corporate and Investment Bank in  Tokyo . “It’s buy the rumor and
sell the fact until the ECB’s meeting.”  The Australian dollar headed headed for a third quarterly
gain after a government report showed retail sales increased in
February by more than economists forecast.  Sales rose 0.5 percent last month, the Bureau of Statistics
said today, surpassing the 0.4 percent increase projected by
economists. The number of permits granted to build or renovate
houses and apartments dropped 7.4 percent, while economists had
estimated a 4 percent increase.  “We expect households to reverse recent outsized
precautionary saving as the year unfolds and heading into
2012,”  Annette Beacher , head of Asia-Pacific research at TD
Securities in  Singapore , wrote in a report. “The strong data
pushed the Australian dollar to another fresh post-float high.”  The Aussie traded at $1.0323 from $1.0329 yesterday after
rising to $1.0347, the strongest since the currency was freely
floated in 1983. The currency was at 85.53 yen from 85.62 yen
after earlier reaching 86.01, the highest since May 5.  Korean Won  The won rose against all of its 16 major counterparts, as
the  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  of South Korean shares reached the highest level
in seven weeks.  “Anticipation for an economic recovery in the U.S. and
elsewhere is prompting foreigners to buy more stocks, supporting
the won,” said Yun Se Min, a foreign-exchange dealer at Busan
Bank in  Seoul .  The won rose 0.3 percent to 1,101.13 per dollar from
1,104.10 after climbing to 1,100.15, the strongest level since
September 2008.  Losses in the yen were tempered on speculation Japanese
companies purchased the currency to repatriate overseas earnings
on the last day of the nation’s fiscal year.  “Exporters are buying the yen” after the currency touched
a two-week low against the dollar, said Takashi Kudo, general
manager of market information services in Tokyo at NTT
SmartTrade Inc., a unit of  Japan ’s biggest phone company.  Japan’s large manufacturers expect the yen to average 86.47
per dollar in the year to March 31, according to the Bank of
Japan’s latest Tankan business-confidence survey on Dec. 15.
That’s the strongest level since the currency forecast was
included in the report in 1996.  To contact the reporters on this story:
