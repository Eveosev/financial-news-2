Compensation paid by U.K. banks and
other financial companies to dissatisfied customers rose by 11
percent in the second-half of 2010, as sales of payment-
protection insurance triggered extra complaints.  Banks, insurers and investment firms paid out 454 million
pounds ($729.5 million) in compensation between July 1 and Dec.
31 last year, the  U.K. Financial Services Authority  said today
on its  website .  Complaints about “advising, selling and arranging” rose
by 47 percent compared with the first half of the year, reaching
538,427, the FSA said. This was “mainly caused” by
dissatisfaction about PPI.  PPI is used to cover payments on credit cards and mortgages
in case of illness or unemployment. The FSA published new rules
in August on how consumer complaints about PPI should be
handled, after competition watchdogs said that customers who
bought it usually weren’t aware that they could have purchased
the protection from other companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
