Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  South Korea  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 3 p.m. in Seoul.  The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  rose 19.25, or 0.9 percent, to 2,091.38,
the highest close since Jan. 28. The index has added 2 percent
this quarter, set for its ninth straight quarterly advance. That
would be the longest winning streak since 1988.  Hankook Tire Co. (000240 KS), South Korea’s biggest
tiremaker, rose 3.7 percent to 36,700 won, a record high. The
stock gained on speculation first-quarter earnings will exceed
analysts’ forecasts, according to Daishin Securities Co.  “Investors are betting on a stronger-than-estimated
earnings and on lower rubber prices in the second half,” said
Kim Byung Kuk, an analyst at Daishin Securities.  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660)  (000660 KS), the world’s second-
largest maker of computer-memory chips, gained 1.8 percent to
31,550 won, the highest level since Sept. 11, 2007. The global
market for dynamic random access memory chips is bottoming out,
with demand likely to improve from the second quarter, Hynix
Chief Executive Officer Kwon Oh Chul said today. In the mid- to
long-term, the outlook for the memory-chip market is “bright,”
with mobile devices driving demand, he said.  Mando Corp. (060980)  (060980 KS), a South Korean automotive parts
maker, retreated 3.1 percent to 174,500 won, the steepest drop
since March 10. The company was cut to “neutral” from “buy”
at Nomura Holdings Inc., which said the stock’s valuation has
turned “unattractive” after a rally.  OCI Co. (010060 KS), South Korea’s largest polysilicon
maker, gained 1.3 percent to 493,000 won, a record high. The
company won a $904 million order from  China  to provide the key
material for solar cells, according to a filing.  Samsung SDI Co. (006400 KS), a South Korean maker of
lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, climbed 4.4 percent to
168,000 won, the biggest jump since Jan. 3. The company’s
earnings will increase further in the second half, LIG
Investment & Securities Co. said in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
