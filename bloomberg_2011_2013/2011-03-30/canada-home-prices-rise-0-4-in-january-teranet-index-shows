Canadian  house prices  rose for the
second consecutive month in January, the  Teranet-National Bank 
Composite House Price Index showed.  Prices rose 0.4 percent during the month, according to a
report released today by National Bank Financial, after a 0.3
percent rise in December that followed three consecutive monthly
declines. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for the
index to rise 0.1 percent in January based on the median of four
responses.  “The correction of late last year turned out to be short-
lived for the country as a whole -- three months -- and longer-
lasting in Ottawa and Calgary,” Marc Pinsonneault, senior
economist at National Bank Financial, said in a statement.  Canadian housing prices rose 3.9 percent on a year-over-
year basis, according to the index, down from a 4.1 percent pace
in the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
