A ban on exports of cocoa and
coffee from  Ivory Coast  was prolonged indefinitely by a
presidential decree issued by the government of  Alassane Ouattara , the internationally recognized winner of a disputed
November election.  On March 28, Ouattara extended the suspension of “coffee
and cocoa exports as well as the payment and the collection of
related taxes and levies,” according to the decree, a copy of
which was obtained by Bloomberg today.  Exporters who contravene the decision may lose their
licenses and be “banned from operating across the national
territory,” according to the statement.  In a separate letter to exporters dated March 29, the
government said it was taking measures to reduce the impact of
the export ban on the industry. On Jan. 23, Ouattara announced
the ban in a bid to starve his rival, incumbent President
 Laurent Gbagbo , of key export funds. Gbagbo refuses to
relinquish power in the world’s top cocoa producer, alleging
electoral fraud in last year’s ballot.  “The government informs exporters that it is currently
working on a special program to resume activities across the
sector as soon as the post-electoral crisis is over,” Ouattara’s
letter said.  Cocoa for May delivery fell for a second today, declining 3
pounds, or 0.2 percent, to 1,994 pounds ($3,197) per metric ton
by 12:45 p.m. in  London , the lowest since Jan. 13, as insurgents
loyal to Ouattara advanced closer to Abidjan, the commercial
capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
