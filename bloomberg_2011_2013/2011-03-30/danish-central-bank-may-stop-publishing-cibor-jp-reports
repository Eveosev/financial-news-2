Denmark ’s central bank will stop
calculating and publishing the Copenhagen Interbank Offered Rate
amid uncertainty on the rates reported in by lenders, Jyllands-
Posten said, citing FinansWatch.  The central bank is basing its decision on a September
probe that found a volume decline in the market for unsecured
krone loans, creating a wider spread between secured and
unsecured rates in Denmark than abroad, it said in an e-mail to
FinansWatch. The banks that provide the rates used to calculate
Cibor were unable to explain the difference, according to the e-
mail to FinansWatch, as reported by Jyllands-Posten.  “As a consequence of the limited turnover it isn’t
possible for the central bank to assess the quality of the
reported Cibor rates,” the bank said in the e-mail to
FinansWatch. “The central bank has therefore decided to cease
collecting, calculating and publishing Cibor,” it said.  Karsten Biltoft, head of communications at the central
bank, wasn’t immediately available to comment.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
