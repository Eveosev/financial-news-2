Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China (1398)  Ltd., the world’s largest lender by market value, posted a
33 percent gain in fourth-quarter profit as wider loan margins
allowed Chinese banks to overcome a slowdown in credit growth.  Net income climbed to 37.9 billion yuan ($5.8 billion) in
the quarter ended Dec. 31, based on figures released by the
Beijing-based bank today. That exceeded the 36.6 billion yuan
average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  ICBC, whose full-year profit of $25.2 billion was more than
a third bigger than that of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , and rivals
including Bank of China Ltd. benefited from widening margins on
loans, which account for the bulk of their earnings.  China ’s
bank regulator said yesterday it will keep restraining lending
this year, forcing lenders to slow expansion plans.  “Margin expansion will be more evident as an earnings
driver this year,” said Xie Aihong, a Beijing-based analyst at
Rising Securities Co., before the earnings were announced. “But
banking shares may still underperform because their operating
conditions deteriorate as the government keeps tightening.”  ICBC’s net interest margin, a measure of the profitability
of loans, widened to 2.44 percent last year from 2.26 percent in
2009.  Smaller rival Bank of Communications Co., the nation’s
fifth-largest, today posted a 34 percent increase in fourth-
quarter profit to 9.5 billion yuan, exceeding the average
analyst estimate by 12 percent. The lender’s net interest margin
expanded 16 basis points to 2.46 percent in 2010. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Valuation  The country’s five biggest lenders -- ICBC, China
Construction Bank Corp.,  Bank of China , Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd. and BoCom -- boosted combined profit 29 percent last
year to a record 515.1 billion yuan, according to the  China
Banking Regulatory Commission .  Shares of ICBC have risen 10 percent in  Hong Kong  this year,
after dropping 8.4 percent in 2010 on concern that the quality
of loans to property projects and local governments will worsen.
The stock trades at 9.6 times forecast 2011 earnings, near the
cheapest level in two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ICBC advanced 1.06 trillion yuan of new loans last year,
taking the outstanding amount to 6.79 trillion yuan. The growth
rate slowed from 25 percent in 2009. President Yang Kaisheng
said this month that growth will continue to slow this year.  ICBC’s net interest income rose 24 percent to 303.75
billion yuan last year. Net fee and commission income from
products and services such as credit cards, wealth management
and insurance sales jumped 32 percent to 72.8 billion yuan, the
bank said.  Rate Increases  An unprecedented $2.7 trillion of loans extended by
domestic banks in the past two years has driven inflation to
near a two-year high and fanned concerns that a property bubble
will form and eventually deflate. China faces a 60 percent risk
of a banking crisis should a property bubble burst, according to
 Fitch Ratings .  The People’s Bank of China has raised  interest rates  three
times since October and pushed up the ratio of deposits banks
must set aside as reserves to 20 percent for the country’s
biggest lenders, the highest in at least two decades.  Along with interest rate increases, China in January raised
the minimum down payment for second-home purchases, told local
governments to set price targets on new properties, and
introduced taxes for homes in the cities of Shanghai and
Chongqing.  The country’s real estate market has defied the curbs as
home sale values rose 26 percent in the first two months this
year, according to China’s statistics bureau.  ICBC said it set aside 28 billion yuan against potential
soured debts last year, up from 23 billion yuan a year earlier.
The lender’s bad loans stood at 73.24 billion yuan on Dec. 31,
down 3 percent from three months earlier. ICBC said it plans to
keep the non-performing ratio below 1.1 percent this year.  The bank plans to increase assets by 1.5 trillion yuan this
year and total liabilities by 1.4 trillion yuan, according to
today’s statement.  --Luo Jun. Editors: James Gunsalus, Philip Lagerkranser  To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
