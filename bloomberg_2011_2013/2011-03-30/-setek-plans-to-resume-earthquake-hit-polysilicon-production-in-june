M.Setek Co., which has the capacity
to make more than a third of  Japan ’s polysilicon, plans to
resume production in June after it was halted by the March 11
earthquake.  The company, a unit of Taiwan’s AU Optronics, expects to
get as much as 20,000 kilovolt amperes of power a month from the
Tohoku Electric Power Co. beginning mid-June, enough to produce
about 100 metric tons of polysilicon, Takeshi Yamagami, senior
manager of the company’s international sales department, said by
phone in Tokyo.  Polysilicon output from the plant in Soma City in the
northeast of the country was suspended after the temblor knocked
out power in the region. The facility has an annual capacity of
7,000 tons. Japan has an annual polysilicon production capacity
of 20,000 tons, about 10 percent of the world’s total.  The Tokyo-based company is still assessing damage to the
plant, Yamagami said.  Polysilicon is used to fabricate solar panels and
semiconductors. Solar cell and module plants in western Japan
were unscathed.  Editors: Baldave Singh, John Buckley.  To contact the reporters on this story:
