Saudi Arabia â€™s credit recovery may
accelerate in the medium term as banks expand large-scale
venture financing,  Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR)  said in an e-mailed
report today.  The proportion of credit outstanding carrying maturities of
three years or more rose to 25 percent of total loans in

bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
