Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , which has
the U.K. taxpayer as its biggest shareholder, awarded Chief
Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio 10.7 million pounds ($17
million) in pay, bonus, compensation and pension contributions.  Horta-Osorio, 47, received 4.46 million pounds in shares
vesting in three years as part of the lender’s long-term
incentive plan, and will receive 4.12 million pounds
compensation resulting from the loss of shares awarded while he
worked for  Banco Santander  SA, the bank said in a statement.  In addition, he will receive a salary of 1.06 million
pounds, pension contributions of 610,000 pounds and 516,000
pounds in cash, the London-based lender said.  The award follows a pledge to the British government by
banks including Lloyds to pay less in bonuses for 2010 than in
the previous year. The four main banks also agreed that total
bonuses would be “lower than they would have been without
today’s settlement,” Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne 
said on Feb. 9.  Lloyds employees will receive only the first 2,000 pounds
of any bonus in cash, with the rest deferred and dependent on
the performance of the bank.  Horta-Osorio would be entitled to two years salary if
Lloyds terminates his contract in the first 12 months, according
to today’s statement. After that, he reverts to a 12-month
contract.  Performance Criteria  Antonio Lorenzo, hired by Horta-Osorio from Banco Santander
to run the bank’s wealth and international division, received
about 3.2 million pounds in compensation and bonuses, 41 percent
government-owned Lloyds said today. The stock awards are subject
to performance criteria.  Horta-Osorio took over as CEO on March 1 from  Eric Daniels ,
who held the top job for seven years. Daniels is entitled to
2.57 million pounds in pay and bonuses for 2010, though he has
said he may not take his bonus. The company’s annual report
showed the transfer value of his pension was 5.03 million pounds
on Dec. 31.  Lloyds posted a 2.2 billion-pound pretax profit in 2010,
its first full-year profit since before the credit crisis.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , the U.K.’s biggest
government-controlled bank, awarded CEO  Stephen Hester  about 6.5
million pounds in shares vesting between next year and 2014, the
Edinburgh-based lender said in a statement on March 8.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  gave  Robert Diamond  as much as 10.1 million
pounds in salary, bonuses and stock, making him the U.K.’s top-
paid bank CEO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
