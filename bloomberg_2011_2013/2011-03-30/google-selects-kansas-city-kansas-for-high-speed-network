Google Inc. (GOOG)  said it chose  Kansas
City , Kansas, as the site of its planned Internet network,
linking the Midwestern city’s residents to a system it says will
be more than 100 times faster than most broadband access.  The company reviewed proposals from almost 1,100 cities,
finally selecting Kansas City because it offered opportunities
to build efficiently, make an impact on the city, and develop
relationships with local organizations, Milo Medin, vice
president of access services, said in a  blog posting .  Google plans to roll out access to the network, which needs
approval from the city’s board of commissioners, in 2012, and
will be “looking closely” for ways to bring the service to
other U.S. cities. The online-search giant, after urging the
 U.S. Federal Communications Commission  to expand broadband
access, is developing the network to show the potential of high-
speed service. The company said last year it may spend as much
as “hundreds of millions” of dollars on such a project.  “Over the past decade, the jump from dial-up to broadband
has led to streaming online video, digital music
sales, videoconferencing over the Web and countless other
innovations that have transformed communication and commerce,”
Medin said. “We can’t wait to see what new products and
services will emerge as Kansas City moves from traditional
broadband to ultra high-speed fiber-optic connections.”  Google, based in Mountain View,  California , rose 11 cents
to $581.84 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
