Bulgaria  increased output from
renewable energy sources by 67 percent last year to 5,509
gigawatt-hours as new hydropower plants, wind and solar parks
went into operation.  Renewable sources accounted for 15 percent of total energy
output, exceeding the 11 percent target set by the  European
Union , the Energy and Economy Ministry said today in a report.
Bulgaria aims to produce 16 percent of its energy from renewable
energy by 2020 under an EU-approved plan.  Large hydropower plants with total installed capacity of
1,919 megawatts accounted for the bulk of output. Newer small
hydropower generators, with capacity of less than 5 megawatts
each, had combined capacity of 241 megawatts in 2010, a 13
percent increase from 2009, the ministry said. Total wind
capacity rose 38 percent to 465 megawatts, while solar parks’
total capacity was 21.4 megawatts, according to the ministry.  International companies operating wind and solar parks in
Bulgaria include Mitsubishi Corp.,  Enel SpA (ENEL) , and  South Korea ’s
SDN Co. A joint venture led by Italy’s  Petrovilla Group SpA 
built nine hydropower plants along the Iskar River in northern
Bulgaria, with a combined capacity of 25 megawatts, and plans to
build another five along the Maritsa River in southern Bulgaria,
with combined capacity of about 29 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
