First City Monument Bank Plc (FCMB) , a
Nigerian lender, said profit for the year through December
surged as revenue rose.  Net income advanced to 7.93 billion naira ($51 million)
from 564 million naira in the eight months through December
2009, the bank, known as FCMB, said in a statement published on
the Lagos-based Nigerian Stock Exchange’s website today. Revenue
climbed to 62.7 billion naira from 35.8 billion naira, it said.
The company will pay a dividend of 35 kobo a share.  Income and revenue are increasing at Nigerian lenders after
recovering from a debt crisis in 2008 and 2009 that threatened
the industry. The  Central Bank of Nigeria  fired the chief
executives of eight of the country’s 24 lenders, and bailed out
the industry with 620 billion naira. FCMB was not one of the
recipients of the bailout.  FCMB’s stock gained 31 kobo, or 5 percent, to 6.62 naira,
the highest level March 24, by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos. It
has lost 12 percent this year, compared with a decline of 0.4
percent in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index over the
same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
