Gasoline in  New York  strengthened
after a  power outage  at  Sunoco Inc. (SUN) â€™s Marcus Hook refinery and a
fifth consecutive decline in East Coast inventories.  Sunoco experienced the outage on March 28 and began
returning units to service later the same day, Lynda Rebarchak,
a Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. Gasoline inventories in the
region fell 1.95 million barrels to 58.5 million barrels last
week, according to the Energy Department.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor narrowed 1 cent to 11.25 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:44 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was 19.5 cents on
March 22. Prompt delivery rose 2.82 cents to $2.9515 a gallon.  Crude oil inputs at refineries on the East Coast slipped
135,000 barrels a day to 939,000 barrels, the government
reported.  Gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  gained 0.5 cent to a discount of
11.50 cents versus May futures.  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  is restarting an alkylation unit at its
Texas City refinery in Texas, Shane Pochard, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mail. The unit was shut after a release
of hydrofluoric acid and hydrocarbons March 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
