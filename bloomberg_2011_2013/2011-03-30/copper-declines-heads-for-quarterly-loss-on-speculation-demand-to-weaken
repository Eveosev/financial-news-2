Copper in  London  may gain for a
second day as expectations demand will be robust outweighed
concerns about slowing economic growth in China and  Japan .  Three-month-delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
gained as much as 0.4 percent to $9,619 a metric ton before
trading at $9,588.50 at 2:55 p.m. Singapore time. The metal,
which fell 0.6 percent earlier, is headed for its first
quarterly decline since the three months ended June 2010 on
speculation that economic growth will slow after Japan’s worst
earthquake on record and China’s monetary tightening measures
this year.  “We’re going to see trading continue in a fairly wide
range of $9,000 and $10,000 as investors are torn between the
longer-term outlook and short-term developments,” Zhang Xi, an
analyst at Luzheng Futures Co., said from Shandong. “We are
still bullish on the outlook for demand this year.”  Copper futures on the Comex in  New York  gained as much as
0.8 percent to $4.379 a pound, while the metal for June delivery
on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose as much as 1.1 percent to
71,600 yuan ($10,918) a ton.  Japanese companies resumed production, easing concerns
about lower output and demand. Zinc producer Dowa Holdings Co.
plans to resume its smelter operations next month, while
automaker Nissan Motor Co. expects factories to return to normal
by the end of June.  Still, efforts to stabilize the Dai-Ichi nuclear plant in
Fukushima, damaged by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, have
been hindered by detection of radiation levels that can prove
fatal to a person exposed for several hours. The facility may
take three decades to decommission and cost operator Tokyo
Electric Power Co. more than 1 trillion yen ($12 billion),
engineers and analysts said.  In  China , the central bank has boosted the reserve-
requirement ratio eight times and raised  interest rates  three
times since the start of 2010 to cool the economy and tame
inflation. It may raise interest rates again in early April,
Citigroup Inc. said.  Aluminum and lead in London were little changed at $2,649 a
ton and $2,685 a ton respectively, while zinc was also little
changed at $2,377.75 a ton. Nickel lost 0.4 percent to $26,500 a
ton while tin gained 0.4 percent to $31,700 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
