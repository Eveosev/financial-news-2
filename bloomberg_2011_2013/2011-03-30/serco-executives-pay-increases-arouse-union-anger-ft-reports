Serco Group Plc (SRP) , a U.K. outsourcing
company that derived about half its revenue from public-sector
contracts last year, raised the pay of Chris Hyman, its chief
executive officer, by 18 percent, to 1.86 million pounds ($2.97
million), and that of Finance Director Andrew Jenner by 7
percent, to 948,300 pounds, the Financial Times reported, citing
the company’s annual report.  Those figures exclude pensions and long-term incentives,
for which comparable figures weren’t immediately available, the
newspaper said.  In addition to his basic salary and annual bonus, Hyman
exercised share options worth 1.6 million pounds during the
year, the FT said.  Mark Serwotka , who heads the Public and Commercial Services
union, said it “ought to be a national scandal” that such
executives are “making vast sums” when their profits depend
largely on the taxpayer, the newspaper said.  Serco said the pay levels were justified as the business
“performed strongly in highly competitive markets,” the FT
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
