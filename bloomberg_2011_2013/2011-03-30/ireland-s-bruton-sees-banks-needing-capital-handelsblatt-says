Ireland’s stress tests will show
that the country’s banks need additional capital, Handelsblatt
cited Enterprise Minister Richard Bruton as saying in an
interview.  Selling at least one of the major banks, possibly  Allied
Irish Banks Plc (ALBK) , to international investors would help restore
confidence in the country’s lenders, the newspaper quoted Bruton
as saying in today’s edition.  Ireland’s central bank plans to publish the stress tests
tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
