Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES)  Chief
Executive Officer Ricardo Salgado said  Europe ’s bailouts in
Ireland and Greece damaged market confidence in the countries’
banking sectors and had “poor results,” the Financial Times
reported, citing an interview.  The interests rates “were too high” and the debt had
“too short a maturity,” Salgado said, according to the
newspaper. Portugal can avoid a European bailout as long as the
 European Central Bank  continues to provide liquidity to its
banks, Salgado also said, according to the FT.  Banco Espirito Santo relies on ECB emergency funding for 5
billion euros ($7 billion) of liquidity, an increase of more
than 1 billion euros from the end of 2010, Salgado also said,
the FT reported. The bank’s profitability will be “less
brilliant” than the 510 million euros reported in 2010, Salgado
said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
