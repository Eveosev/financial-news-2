Companies and governments in sub-
Saharan  Africa  could raise as much as $10 billion a year by
issuing so-called diaspora bonds to their nationals living
abroad, the World Bank and  African Development Bank  said.  Ethiopia, Ghana and Nigeria are among the countries with
large numbers of citizens living in industrialized nations that
could benefit from the issuance of securities backed by
remittance flows, the banks said today in a  report . India and
Israel are among countries that have already issued such bonds.  “African banks can improve their access to international
capital markets by issuing bonds that are securitized by future
remittance flows,” said Mthuli Ncube, chief economist at the
Tunis-based ADB, in a statement accompanying the report.  Remittances to Africa grew fourfold between 1990 and 2010,
to $40 billion last year, according to  World Bank  and ADB data.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
