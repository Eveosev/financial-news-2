(Corrects inflation size and scope in 2nd paragraph. Story
published March 30.)  The Vietnamese dong declined to the
lowest close in almost 18 years, on speculation a widening trade
deficit may prompt downward adjustments to the  reference rate .
Bonds advanced.  The trade shortfall reached $1.15 billion in March from a
revised $1.11 billion in February, even after the government
devalued the currency by 7 percent last month. The dong’s
weakness has stoked import costs, contributing to the fastest
inflation since November 2008.  “The dong is under some pressure now,” said Francois Chavasseau, head of fixed-income research at  Sacombank
Securities Joint-Stock Co . in  Ho Chi Minh City . “I think it’s a
combination of higher inflation and the widening trade
deficit.”  The dong fell 0.1 percent to 20,900 per dollar as of the 5
p.m. close in Hanoi, according to data from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. It matched the close on Feb. 14, which was the lowest
since at least June 1993.  The  State Bank  of  Vietnam  set the reference rate 0.05
percent weaker at 20,698 today, the lowest since Feb. 16,
according to data on its website. The currency is allowed to
trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  Government bonds advanced, with yields on benchmark five-
year notes falling two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 11.90 percent, according to a daily fixing price from banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  -- Nicholas Heath . Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
