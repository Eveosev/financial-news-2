The  Federal Reserve  proposed rules
on risk-management standards for financial-market utilities
designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability
Oversight Council.  The proposal relates to payment, clearing and settlement
activities of designated financial market utilities except for
those “registered as a clearing agency with the Securities and
Exchange Commission or as a derivatives clearing organization
with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,” the Fed said
today in a statement in Washington. The regulations would
implement provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.  The Fed requested comments from the public within 45 days
after the proposal’s publication in the Federal Register,
“which is expected shortly,” the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
