Copper fell for a fifth day in New
York, capping the longest slump since early June, as  Japan 
struggled to contain the worst nuclear disaster in 25 years,
fanning concern that global growth will slow.  European confidence in the economic outlook worsened in
March as surging energy costs and Japan’s crisis clouded world
growth prospects, the European Commission said today. Sentiment
among U.S. consumers dropped to a three-month low, a report
showed yesterday. Copper is heading its first quarterly decline
since June 30.  “The Japanese situation is weighing on  market sentiment ,”
said Lannie Cohen, the president of  Capitol Commodity Services
Inc.  in Indianapolis. “People are really nervous.”  Copper futures for May delivery dropped 7.25 cents, or 1.7
percent, to close at $4.274 a pound at 1:21 p.m. on the Comex in
 New York , the biggest loss since March 9. The price has slumped
3.9 percent this quarter.  A report scheduled for tomorrow may show weaker growth in
factory orders in the U.S., the world’s second-biggest consumer
of the metal. A potential economic slowdown in  China , the
largest user, and “uncertainties in the Middle East” will also
pressure prices, Cohen said. Futures may fall to as low as $4.08
in a few weeks, he said.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for three-month
delivery fell $204, or 2.1 percent, to $9,381 a metric ton
($4.26 a pound).  Lead, aluminum, tin, zinc and nickel also declined in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
