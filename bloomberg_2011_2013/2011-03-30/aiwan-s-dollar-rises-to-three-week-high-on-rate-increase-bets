Taiwan ’s dollar traded near the
strongest level in three weeks before a central bank meeting
tomorrow at which it is expected to raise borrowing costs.  Seventeen of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted 
the Central Bank of the  Republic of China  (Taiwan) will lift its
discount rate on 10-day loans by 0.125 percentage point to 1.75
percent. One forecast an increase to 1.875 percent. Inflation
will climb to 2 percent this year from 0.96 percent in 2010, the
government said last month.  “An interest-rate increase may attract foreign funds to
Taiwan,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based trader at the Union
Bank of Taiwan. “The currency hasn’t been moving much lately.
It’s still uncertain how much  Japan ’s earthquake will affect
Taiwan’s companies and the economy.”  The Taiwan dollar traded at NT$29.510 as of the 4 p.m.
local time close, compared with NT$29.477 yesterday, according
to Taipei Forex Inc. It rose 0.2 percent earlier to NT$29.430,
the strongest level since March 10. The currency has advanced
2.9 percent this year, the second-best performance among the 10
most-traded Asian currencies.  Taiwan’s economic growth this year may be reduced by as
much as 0.2 percentage point due to Japan’s earthquake, Premier
 Wu Den-yih  said yesterday. Japanese companies are transferring
orders to Taiwan for flat-panel displays and chips and this will
help offset some losses, he said.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the
1.375 percent note due March 2021, the most-traded government
security, was at 1.359 percent, from 1.357 percent yesterday,
according to Gretai Securities Market, the island’s biggest
exchange for debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
