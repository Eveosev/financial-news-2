Elizabeth Warren , the White House
and Treasury Department adviser charged with setting up the new
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce that the agency will focus on rules to make markets
more competitive.  “I believe we share a point of principle: Competitive
markets are good for consumers and for businesses,” Warren said
in a speech today to the U.S. business group. “The important
question is how to ensure that markets are competitive.”  In her speech, Warren argued that regulation and
competition are not mutually exclusive, and that simpler
disclosures for credit products will promote efficient markets.  “The mission of the consumer bureau is to stick with these
basic ideas, the ideas that make a free market work for
customers and for businesses that want to compete in a fair,
transparent and competitive market,” Warren said.  Warren cited federal regulation of air safety, state rules
on insurance and U.S. antitrust statutes as examples of
regulation that has worked.  “We can differ over the form and substance of
regulation,” Warren said. “But let’s not deny the important
role of regulation.”  In response to a question from the audience suggesting that
regulations lead to lawsuits, Warren argued that regulations
that are complex can promote lawsuits; simpler ones may not.  “The real answer to this is going to be a different
approach to regulation,” Warren said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
