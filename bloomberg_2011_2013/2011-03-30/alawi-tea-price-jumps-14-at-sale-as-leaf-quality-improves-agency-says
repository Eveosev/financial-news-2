Malawi ,  Africa ’s second-largest tea
producer, reported a 14 percent price rise for the commodity at
auction on quality, Tea Brokers Central Africa, managers of the
auction, said in an e-mailed report.  The benchmark price of tea rose to $2.80 from $2.45 on
March 29, according to the report.  “There was good demand for the leaf very closely following
quality,” Tea Brokers said in the auction report.   Tea is Malawi’s second-largest foreign exchange earner
after tobacco, generating 8 percent of total export earnings.
