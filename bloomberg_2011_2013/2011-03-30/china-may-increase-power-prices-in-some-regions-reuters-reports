China  may increase on-grid and
retail power prices in some regions as early as April 1, Reuters
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the situation.  The adjustment will be moderate and will mostly affect
industrial power users, Reuters said today, without elaborating.
Liu Xinfang, a news officer at State Grid Corp. of China, the
nation’s largest power distributor, didn’t reply to a call to
his mobile phone seeking comment.  China last increased retail power prices for non-
residential users by an average of 0.028 yuan per kilowatt-hour
in November 2009 to help electricity distributors cover their
losses. On-grid prices, paid by distributors to producers, were
raised in 10 provinces and cut in seven at that time.  --Winnie Zhu. With assistance from  Wang Ying  and Huang Zhe in
