Richards Bay Coal Terminal ,
 Africa ’s biggest coal export facility, won’t expand further
until  South Africa ’s rail network and other infrastructure
allows it to utilize its current capacity.  “At the moment we’re not even close to using our capacity,
so we would need to wait until we reach that for us to expand,”
Chief Executive OfficerRaymond Chirwa said by phone today from
the terminal, on South Africa’s eastern coast.  While RBCT is capable of shipping 91 million metric tons of
coal a year, it exported 63.4 million tons last year, Chirwa
said. Transnet Ltd., South Africa’s state-owned ports and
freight rail operator, saw deliveries to the terminal hindered
by derailments and strikes.  This year, Transnet plans to deliver 68 million tons of
coal to the port, Mxolisi Mgojo, head of coal at  Exxaro
Resources Ltd. (EXX) , said on Feb. 24. Exxaro is a shareholder in the
terminal, along with other coal producers including  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP) ,  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ,  Xstrata Plc (XTA) , Total SA and  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)   Business Report , a Johannesburg-based newspaper, earlier
cited Chirwa as saying that RBCT had halted expansion plans
until 2015 because of a delay in building the required rail
network. His comments were “taken out of context,” Chirwa
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
