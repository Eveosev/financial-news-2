India ’s rupee strengthened for a
second day on optimism export growth will help reduce the
nation’s trade and current-account deficits.  The central bank will report tomorrow the shortfall in the
current account, a measure of trade and investment flows, fell
42 percent to $9.15 billion last quarter from the previous three
months, according to the median estimate of eight economists in
a Bloomberg survey. Exports rose an average 31 percent in the 12
months through January from a year earlier, compared with an
average decline of 12 percent in the previous 12 months,
government data show.  “A pickup in export growth should help to mitigate the
upside risks of high  oil prices ,” said  Mitul Kotecha , head of
global foreign-exchange strategy at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong
Kong . “If we do see this narrowing of the current-account
deficit it should mean the rupee could strengthen in the coming
months.”  The Indian currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 44.7375 per
dollar as of 10:02 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rupee has advanced 1.1 percent this month, paring
its decline for the quarter to 0.1 percent.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.49 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.57
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
