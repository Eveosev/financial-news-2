The state-owned  Zimbabwe  Mining
Development Corp. plans to revive production at three  gold
mines , the state-controlled  Herald  said today, citing Deputy
Mines Minister Gift Chimanikire.  The company has spent $2.4 million at its Jena Mine where
it is targeting production of 36 kilograms (1,157 ounces) a
month, up from the current 26 kilograms, the Harare-based
newspaper reported on its website.  The ZMDC is negotiating with an unidentified Zimbabwean
bank to borrow $300,000 for exploration at its Elvington Mine,
where shafts have been closed for eight years following a
collapse, the Herald said.  The state-owned corporation is also seeking a partner to
reopen its Sabi Gold Mine in southern Zimbabwe, the Herald said,
without providing further information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
