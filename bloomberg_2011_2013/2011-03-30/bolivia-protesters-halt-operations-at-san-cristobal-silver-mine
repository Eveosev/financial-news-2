Sumitomo Corp.’s silver, zinc and
lead mine in  Bolivia  has been halted since last week by a
strike, the mining ministry said.  Workers at the San Cristobal mine are demanding better
health care, a government official, who can’t be named because
of ministry policy, said today by telephone.  Sumitomo’s San Cristobal, in southwestern Bolivia’s
mineral-rich region of Potosi, is the world’s third-largest
silver mine and the sixth-biggest zinc mine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
