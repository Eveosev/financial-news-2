Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista ’s Acu Port construction site had its access road blocked
by about 300 workers today in a demonstration for better lodging
conditions and a pay increase.  The protest won’t affect the project’s schedule because the
construction group hired to build the project reached an
agreement with the workers’ labor union,  LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3) , the
company controlled by Batista that owns Acu, said in an e-mailed
statement today. LLX said it complies with every labor law and
norms and demands the same from its partners.  Acu, which will handle iron-ore, oil, coal and steel
products from Batista’s companies and partners including  Anglo
American Plc (AAL) , aims to become the largest port in the Americas
and the world’s third biggest.  LLX plans to begin operations at Acu in 2012, according to
its website. It will have 10 docking berths next to a 90-square-
kilometer (56-square-mile) industrial complex.  LLX has gained 4.4 percent this year in Sao Paulo trading,
compared with a 1.9 percent loss for the benchmark Bovespa
index. It rose 3.4 percent to 4.94 reais today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
