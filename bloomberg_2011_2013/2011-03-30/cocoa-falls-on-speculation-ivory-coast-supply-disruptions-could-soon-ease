Cocoa fell to a 10-week low on
signs the political turmoil that hampered exports may be easing
in  Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest producer. Cotton and orange
juice fell.  Troops loyal to Alassane Ouattara, the internationally
recognized winner of Ivory Coast’s November presidential
election, have gained control of the capital, according to a
witness, while incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo  calls for a
cease-fire.  “The threat from Gbagbo is simmering down, so we’re losing
the risk premium on cocoa,” said Erica Rannestad, a commodity
analyst at CPM Group in New York. “People are expecting a
resolution.”  Cocoa for May delivery dropped $70, or 2.3 percent, to
settle at $2,987 a metric ton at 12:06 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. Earlier, the price touched $2,973, the lowest since
Jan. 14.  In  London , cocoa for May delivery declined 53 pounds, or
2.7 percent, to 1,944 pounds ($3,124) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cotton futures for May delivery fell 1.21 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $1.9367 a pound on ICE, the fourth straight decline.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery slid 0.15 cent, or
0.1 percent, to $1.615 a pound in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
