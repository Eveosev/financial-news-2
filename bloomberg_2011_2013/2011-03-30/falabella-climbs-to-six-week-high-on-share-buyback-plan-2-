SACI Falabella (FALAB) ,  Chile ’s largest
retailer by market value, rose to a six-week high in Santiago
trading after saying it will buy back some of its own shares.  Falabella climbed 1.9 percent to 4,870 pesos, the highest
level since Feb. 14.  The operator of stores in Chile, Peru, Colombia and
 Argentina  called an April 26 shareholder meeting to vote on the
buyback and set the price and amount of shares, according to a
statement posted on the website of Chile’s securities regulator.  Falabella shares have gained 11 percent in the 17 trading
days since reporting quarterly profit that exceeded analysts’
estimates. It’s seeking growth opportunities in Latin America
where an economic recovery is boosting consumer confidence,
Chief Executive Officer Juan Benavides said at a conference in
