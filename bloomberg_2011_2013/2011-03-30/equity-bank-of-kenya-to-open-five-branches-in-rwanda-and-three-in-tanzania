Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
lender by market value, will open five branches in  Rwanda  and
three in Tanzania, Chief Executive Officer James Mwangi said.  Equity Bank will start operating in Rwanda in April and in
Tanzania in May, Mwangi told reporters today in Nairobi, Kenya’s
capital. The lender yesterday received a license to operate in
Rwanda and has already hired staff, he said.  Equity, which has units in neighboring Uganda and southern
Sudan, has retained 4 billion shillings ($47.8 million) of its
earnings to fund the company’s expansion, Mwangi said.  Both the Ugandan and southern Sudan units are expected to
contribute about 10 percent of the company’s total profit in the
12 months to December, he said.  The stock climbed for the first day in three, rallying 25
cents, or 1 percent, to 25 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in
Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
