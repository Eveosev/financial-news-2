Brazilian state-controlled power
company Cia. Energetica de  Sao Paulo  gained the most in 12 weeks
on speculation concessions that expire in 2015 will be renewed.  Cesp, as the utility is known, advanced 4.2 percent to
31.58 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo at 4:15 p.m.
New York time, for the steepest increase since Jan. 4.  Chief Executive Officer Mauro Arce said the Brazilian
government has shown itself receptive to renewing the
concessions for the Jupia and Ilha Solteira dams, which
represent 70 percent of the company’s generation capacity, O
Estado de S. Paulo newspaper reported on its website. A press
official at Cesp, who can’t be named due to internal policy,
couldn’t immediately confirm Arce’s comments.  “When news like this comes out, Cesp goes up,” said
Ricardo Correa, an analyst at Rio de Janeiro-based brokerage
Ativa Corretora, who has a “neutral” rating on the stock.
“The renewal is something that’s going to happen.”  Cesp advanced 12 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with a 2.7 percent drop for the benchmark Bovespa
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
