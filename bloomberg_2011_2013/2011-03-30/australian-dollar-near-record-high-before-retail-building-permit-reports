Australia ’s dollar touched a record
high against its U.S. counterpart, adding to a third quarterly
gain, as a government report showed retail sales increased in
February by more than economists forecast and commodities rose.  The Aussie rose for a 10th straight day against the yen,
the longest rally since June 2005, after the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia said loans provided by banks and finance companies
climbed last month.  New Zealand ’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi,
gained as advancing commodity prices spurred demand for higher-
yielding assets.  “There was a little bit of Aussie buying on today’s data,
mostly responding to retail sales beating expectation,” said
 Sean Callow , a senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking
Corp. in Sydney. The currency is “very resilient,” he said.  Australia’s dollar appreciated 0.3 percent to $1.0357 at
12:54 p.m. in  New York , from $1.0329 yesterday, after rising to
$1.0364, the strongest level since it was freely floated in
1983. It strengthened 1.7 percent for the month and 1.2 percent
for the quarter. The currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 85.79
yen, from 85.62 yen.  The New Zealand currency advanced 0.3 percent to 76.43 U.S.
cents, from 76.23 cents yesterday. It gained 1.6 percent for the
month and fell 2 percent for the quarter. The kiwi rose 0.2
percent to 63.31 yen, from 63.18.  Sales Increase  Australia’s retail sales advanced 0.5 percent from a month
earlier, when they gained 0.4 percent, the Bureau of Statistics
said. That was more than the median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey for a 0.4 percent increase. Loans provided by banks and
finance companies increased 0.5 percent in February from the
previous month, according to the RBA.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
rose 0.9 percent today.  Gains in the Australian dollar were tempered after a report
showed home-building approvals unexpectedly declined in February
as flooding and a cyclone hurt the housing market. The number of
permits granted to build or renovate houses and apartments
dropped 7.4 percent from January, when they fell a revised 11.6
percent, the statistics bureau said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
