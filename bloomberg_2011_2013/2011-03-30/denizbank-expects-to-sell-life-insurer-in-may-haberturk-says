Denizbank AS (DENIZ) , the Turkish unit of
Belgium’s  Dexia SA (DEXB) , said its in talks with seven “big
international names” to sell its life insurer Deniz Emeklilik
bids, Haberturk said.  The companies are studying Deniz Emeklilik’s books and
Denizbank will sell the unit in May, chief executive Hakan Ates
said in an interview, according to the Istanbul-based newspaper.
The bank has yet to get firm bids for the insurer, he said.  Measures by the central bank to stem loan growth mean
interest rates on mortgages are rising and will exceed 1 percent
monthly from a low of about 0.74 percent, Ates said.      Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
