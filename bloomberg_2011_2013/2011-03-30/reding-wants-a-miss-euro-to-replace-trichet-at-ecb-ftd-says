European Union Justice Commissioner
 Viviane Reding  wants more women on the boards of the  European
Central Bank  and national central banks in the EU,  Financial
Times Deutschland  reported.  While the ECB has an “excellent mister euro” in Jean- Claude Trichet, the current president of the ECB, Reding could
“very well imagine” a “miss euro” to replace Trichet, FTD
reported, citing an interview with Reding.  Potential candidates could be French Finance Minister
Christine Lagarde or Joanne Kellerman of the Dutch central bank,
Reding told the newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
