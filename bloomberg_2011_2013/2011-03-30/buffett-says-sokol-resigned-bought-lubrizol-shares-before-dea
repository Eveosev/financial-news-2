Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  Chief
Executive Officer  Warren Buffett  said David L. Sokol, chairman
of several units of the company, has resigned.  Sokol, who had talked about leaving twice before, plans to
invest for his family and pursue philanthropic interests,
Buffett said, citing Sokol’s resignation letter received
yesterday. Buffett said he was surprised by the move.  Berkshire’s proposed acquisition of  Lubrizol Corp. (LZ)  was
first suggested by Sokol on Jan. 14 or Jan. 15, Buffett said.
Sokol had purchased shares in Lubrizol in December and January
before discussing the matter with Buffett.   “Neither Dave nor I feel his Lubrizol purchases were in
any way unlawful,” Buffett said. “He has told me that they
were not a factor in his decision to resign.”  With Sokol’s departure, Greg Abel, presently president and
CEO of MidAmerican Holding Co., will become its chairman; Todd Raba, president and CEO of Johns Manville, will become its
chairman; and Jordan Hansell, president of NetJets, will become
its chairman and CEO, according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
