Poland’s public debt rose to 53
percent of economic output last year, according to domestic
accounting standards, keeping it below the level that would
trigger mandatory austerity measures.  The debt, which includes liabilities of the central
government, municipalities and government agencies, reached
748.5 billion zloty ($264 billion) in 2010, Deputy Finance
Minister  Dominik Radziwill  said in an e-mailed statement today.
If debt exceeds 55 percent of gross domestic product, spending
cuts and tax increases are required by law.  The ratio was lower than the previously estimated 53.5
percent because local governments’ debt grew more slowly than
the ministry’s forecasts, Radziwill said. The  Finance Ministry 
will publish final debt figures in May after the  Central
Statistical Office  releases updated GDP data for 2010, according
to the statement.  The government’s medium-term fiscal plan assumes “that
public debt will not breach 55 percent of GDP,” PAP newswire
cited Deputy Finance Minister Hanna Majszczyk as saying today.  Poland’s public debt reached 55.1 percent of GDP in 2010
from 50.9 percent the year before, according to European Union
accounting standards, the  Finance Ministry  said in an e-mailed
statement. According to EU rules, members of the 27-member bloc
must keep public debt below 60 percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
