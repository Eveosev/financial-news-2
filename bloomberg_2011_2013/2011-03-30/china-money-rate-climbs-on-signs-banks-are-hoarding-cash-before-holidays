China ’s money-market rate jumped
the most in more than a week on speculation local banks are
hoarding cash before the holiday next week.  The seven-day repurchase rate also rose after the central
bank issued 99 billion yuan ($15 billion) of one-year bills and
100 billion yuan of 28-day repurchase agreements yesterday.
China’s financial markets will close on the first two days of
next week for a public holiday.  “Banks are collecting cash to prepare for withdrawal
demand during the holidays next week,” said Guo Caomin, a bond
analyst at Industrial Bank Co. in Shanghai. “Also, they are
trying to meet all types of  capital requirements  at the end of
each quarter.”  The seven-day repo, which measures interbank funding
availability, surged 44 basis points to 2.57 percent as of 9:38
a.m. in  Shanghai , the biggest increase since March 21, according
to a weighted average rate compiled by the National Interbank
Funding Center.  The central bank may raise  interest rates  once or twice in
the second quarter, Bank of China Ltd. economists said in a
report today on the nation’s economic outlook.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose one basis
point to 3.28 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.41 percent note due June 2020 was
unchanged at 3.90 percent, according to the Interbank Funding
Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  --Judy Chen. Editors: Sandy Hendry,  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
