Venezuelan banks must register all
the securities they hold with the central bank, according to  a
statement  published on the bankâ€™s website.  All information about bolivar- and foreign currency-
denominated securities must be provided within 10 working days
under the regulations announced today.  President  Hugo Chavez  dismantled an unregulated  currency
market  last year and replaced it with a central bank-
administered bond trading system, known as the Sitme.  To contact the reporter on this story:
