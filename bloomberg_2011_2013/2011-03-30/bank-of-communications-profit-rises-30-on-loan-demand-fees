(Corrects year-ago earnings per share in second paragraph)  Bank of Communications Ltd.,
 China ’s fifth-largest bank, said profit rose 30 percent last
year as an economic recovery boosted income from loans and fee-
based financial services.  Net income climbed to 39 billion yuan ($5.9 billion), or
0.73 yuan a share, from 30.1 billion yuan, or 0.58 yuan a share
a year earlier, the Shanghai-based company, also known as BoCom,
said in a statement today. That beat the 38 billion yuan average
estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  BoCom joined bigger rivals including  China Construction
Bank Corp. (939)  in reporting profit growth after the country’s 9.8
percent economic expansion last quarter helped lift loan demand.
Lending margins at the country’s banks also benefited from
government measures to tighten lending and keep the real estate
market from overheating.  Outstanding loans at BoCom, part-owned by  HSBC Holdings
Plc. (HSBA) , rose 22 percent last year to 2.24 trillion yuan, according
to today’s statement. Fees and commissions from credit cards,
mutual funds and insurance policies, and other services gained
27 percent to 14.5 billion yuan.  The bank’s net interest income, or revenue from lending
minus interest paid to depositors, was 85 billion yuan last
year, as net interest margin expanded 16 percentage points to
2.46 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
