Horizon Lines Inc. (HRZ)  bonds and stock
plunged for a second day after the shipping company said this
week it’s likely to violate terms of debt agreements and may be
forced to seek  bankruptcy protection .  The company’s $330 million of 4.25 percent convertible
notes due in August 2012 fell 4.4 cents to 77.5 cents on the
dollar as of 2:11 p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The debt yesterday dropped 9.2 cents from 91.125,
Trace data show.  Horizon Lines has failed to get consents from bondholders
to waive a default after being fined $45 million by the U.S.
Department of Justice on charges it fixed freight rates between
the U.S. and  Puerto Rico . The Charlotte, North Carolina-based
company will plead guilty to a charge it conspired to fix prices
on the route from May 2002 to April 2008, the  Justice Department 
said last month.  Jim Storey, a spokesman for Horizon Lines, didn’t return a
call for comment.  The operator of  container ships  between the continental
U.S., Alaska, Hawaii and the nation’s territories expects to be
in default on the terms of its convertible notes during the
second quarter, the company said in a March 28 regulatory
filing. It expects to violate the terms of its senior credit
facility in the third quarter and may be forced to seek
bankruptcy protection if talks with lenders to restructure its
debt fail, it said in the filing.  Horizon Lines fell 23 cents, or 14 percent, to $1.39 as of
2:22 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares dropped 57 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
