An experimental treatment for  lung
cancer  made by  Amgen Inc. (AMGN)  and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. failed
to help patients live longer in a late-stage study.  The medication, motesanib, didn’t meet its main goal of
improving survival in a study of 1,090 patients with non-
squamous non-small cell lung cancer, the companies said today in
a statement. Detailed results from the study will be presented
at a future medical meeting. Amgen and Osaka-based Takeda
haven’t decided whether to continue developing the drug, said
Christine Regan, an Amgen spokeswoman.  Motesanib was one of three cancer drugs in late-stage
testing for  Thousand Oaks , California-based Amgen, the world’s
largest biotechnology company. While motesanib was the most
advanced, analysts discounted the drug’s potential after high
rates of side effects in earlier trials, said  Mark Schoenebaum ,
an analyst with ISI Group in  New York .  “The drug is entirely irrelevant to Amgen and expectations
were zero,” Schoenebaum said in an e-mail interview today.
“Consensus estimate for peak sales is $0, and we think the
stock impact will be minimal, if any.”  Shares of Amgen rose 47 cents, less than 1 percent, to
$53.90 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite
trading. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index of 125 companies rose
1.8 percent to 1034.63. Amgen shares have declined 1.8 percent
this year.  Further Evaluation  “We’ve just completed the initial review of the data and,
while disappointing, we are in the process of evaluating the
full implication,” Regan said today in a telephone interview.
“We have not yet decided whether or not to continue with
development.”  Lung cancer  killed about 157,000 Americans last year,
according to the  National Cancer Institute . About 223,000 new
cases are diagnosed annually. Non-small cell lung cancer is the
most common form of the disease, and non-squamous patients
comprise the majority those cases.  There were more serious adverse events among patients
treated with motesanib and chemotherapy compared with those
getting placebos and chemotherapy, the companies said. Side
effects seen in patients taking motesanib included high  blood
pressure , gallbladder complications, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
nausea, and vomiting and fatigue.  The companies in November 2008 said they had ended a test
in squamous non-small cell lung cancer after those given the
drug had higher death rates and a greater incidence of coughing
up blood than those on a placebo.  Motesanib is designed to starve tumor cells of the blood
supply they need to grow. The medicine blocks a protein known as
VEGF, involved in the growth of blood vessels that feed tumors.  To contact the reporters on this story:
