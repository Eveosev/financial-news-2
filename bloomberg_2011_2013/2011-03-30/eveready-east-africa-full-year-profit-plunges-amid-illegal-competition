Eveready East Africa Ltd. (EVRD) , a Kenyan
dry-cell battery manufacturer, said full-year profit plunged 70
percent amid “illegal and unfair” competition, higher zinc
prices and a weaker shilling.  Net income dropped to 8.7 million shillings ($104,067) in
the 12 months through September, from 28.3 million shillings a
year earlier, the Nairobi-based company said in a statement
published in the Daily Nation newspaper today. Sales were little
changed at 1.64 billion shillings, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
