The Province of Lower Austria is
“open” to think about a reduction of its stake in  Flughafen
Wien AG (FLU) , Wirtschaftsblatt reported, citing an interview with
Governor Erwin Proell.  “I think that one sooner or later should start
deliberations if it wouldn’t make sense if the public
authorities pulls back more -- in particular considering the
international role and positioning of the Vienna airport,”
Proell told the Vienna-based paper.  Lower Austria is in a consortium with the City of Vienna on
their stakes in Flughafen Wien and Proell aims to act in
coordination on a possible reduction, according to the report.  Lower Austria and Vienna each hold 20 percent of the
company.     To contact the editor responsible for this story:
