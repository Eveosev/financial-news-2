Fosun International Holdings Ltd.,
controlled by billionaire Guo Guangchang, plans to invest in
Japanese companies which will be seeking funds for rebuilding
after the nation this month suffered its worst earthquake.  Fosun, which has property, steel and resort businesses, may
speed existing talks with some listed companies, and wants to
invest in the medical services sector, Chief Executive Officer
Liang Xinjun said in an interview in Hong Kong.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average has fallen 5.3 percent since
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami left more than 27,000 dead
or missing and caused as much as 25 trillion yen ($301 billion)
in damages. Fosun’s Guo is embarking on a series of expansions
that will help it meet rising consumer demand in  China , which
the Chinese government has forecast will become the world’s
biggest luxury-goods market by 2015.  “Japanese shares have fallen quite a lot after the
earthquake and the nuclear crisis,” Liang said March 29.
“Companies there need capital for reconstruction. To us, it’s a
chance for value investment.”  Fosun rose 1.9 percent to close at HK$5.97, the highest
stock price since Feb. 16, in  Hong Kong  trading.  The company is still seeking to invest in luxury clothing
and cosmetic brands in  Europe , Liang said, reiterating comments
made by executives last July. Fosun has a 9.5 percent stake in
French resort operator Club Mediterranee SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
