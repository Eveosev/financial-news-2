Kazakhstan , the third-biggest grain
producer in the former Soviet Union, will limit production of
ethanol and other biofuels to 2.87 billion liters (757 million
gallons) this year.  Biofuels output in the central Asian nation will be limited
to 3.08 billion liters next year, according to a government
decree published in the official newspaper Kazakhstanskaya
Pravda. The government will hold production to 3.15 billion
liters in 2013 and 3.22 billion liters in 2014, the decree said.
It gave no explanation for the annual output ceilings.  Many countries promote biofuels derived from corn, sugar
and other food crops as a way of decreasing their reliance on
imported oil and reducing emissions of greenhouse gasses.
Kazakhstan, which accounted for 2 percent of the worldâ€™s oil
production in 2009 according to BP Plc, has one plant for
producing ethanol, built in 2006.  Russia and Ukraine are the biggest grain producers among
nations of the former  Soviet Union .  To contact the reporter on this story:
