     March 30 (Bloomberg) --  Richards Bay Coal Terminal  has
halted plans for increased export volumes until 2015 because of
a delay in building the required rail infrastructure in  South
Africa ,  Business Report said , citing RBCT Chief Executive
OfficerRaymond Chirwa.  While the terminal is currently capable of shipping about
91 million metric tons of coal a year, it exported just 63
million tons last year, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.
Expanding RBCT’s capacity beyond 100 million tons would be
“irresponsible” when “other items in the value chain have not
expanded,” Chirwa said, according to  Business Report .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
