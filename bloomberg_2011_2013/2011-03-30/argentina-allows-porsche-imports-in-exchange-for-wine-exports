Argentina ’s Industry Ministry
signed an accord with Grupo Pulenta, which imports Porsche SE
vehicles, to offset its auto purchases with exports of wines and
olive products.  The accord is in line with regulations that allow companies
to import vehicles for sale as long as they export goods for the
same value, the Industry Ministry said in an e-mail statement
today.  Grupo Pulenta plans to import 100 vehicles with a value of
about $8 million this year, according to the statement. In
exchange, the company will export wines and olive products to 18
countries, including the U.S. and  Brazil , the ministry statement
said.  The agreement with Grupo Pulenta comes two weeks after
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  signed an accord with the government to boost
exports from Argentina by 77 percent in 2011 in order to reduce
the deficit between its exports and imports by 70 percent,
according to the statement.  Domestic automobile sales rose last year 43 percent to a
record 698,299 units, of which 435,767 were imported, according
to the country’s Automobile Manufacturers Association. Argentina
exported 447,953 vehicles in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
