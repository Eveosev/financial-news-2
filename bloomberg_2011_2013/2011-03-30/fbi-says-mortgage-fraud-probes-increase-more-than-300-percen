The FBI had more than 3,000 pending
mortgage fraud investigations last fiscal year, up more than 300
percent from 2005, said FBI Director Robert Mueller.  The number of investigations in fiscal year 2010 is up from
700 cases in fiscal 2005, Mueller said in prepared testimony.
Mueller is testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
