Half of the supplies sent to U.K.
forces in  Afghanistan  arrive late due to failures in the supply
chain, according to a report by the  National Audit Office .  The main reason for the delays, which see a third of the
most urgent items taking more than the target five days to
arrive, is because the goods are not ready for transport. The
London-based NAO recommended the  Ministry of Defense  improve its
planning and the management of its supply chain.  The NAO suggested that the department could save 15 million
pounds ($24 million) a year by using surface transport rather
than air, which accounted for 90 percent of transport costs.  “The department urgently needs better supply-chain
 information systems  with the appropriate skills and processes to
match,” Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said in an e-mailed
statement today. “It currently keeps the armed forces supplied
by either stockpiling more than necessary, sending too many
routine items by air, or both. This ties up precious resources
that could be better used to support troops.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
