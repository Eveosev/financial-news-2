Turkey â€™s state insurer has written
to 20,000 employers urging them to settle their debts through a
tax restructuring offer that expires in May, Sabah newspaper
reported.  The Social Security Institution in Ankara chose employers
which each have unpaid payroll taxes of more than 100,000 liras
($64,200), the newspaper said, citing the letter from Chairman
Emin Zararsiz.  The offer waives some fines and interest charges and allows
repayment over an extended period, Sabah said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
