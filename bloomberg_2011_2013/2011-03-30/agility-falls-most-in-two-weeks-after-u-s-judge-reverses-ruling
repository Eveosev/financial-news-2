Agility (AGLTY)  lost the most in two weeks
after a federal judge said the Kuwaiti storage and transport
company accused of overbilling the U.S. military was properly
notified by prosecutors of the charges, reversing a previous
ruling.  The shares tumbled 5 percent, the most since March 16, to
380 fils at the 12:30 p.m. close in Kuwait City, extending their
decline this quarter to 27 percent. The benchmark  Kuwait SE
Price Index (KWSEIDX)  has lost 9.5 percent this year.  U.S. Magistrate Alan Baverman in Atlanta said last year
contact with the company was “insufficient” and he was
considering dismissal of the criminal case. U.S. District Judge
Thomas W. Thrash Jr. overruled Baverman yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
