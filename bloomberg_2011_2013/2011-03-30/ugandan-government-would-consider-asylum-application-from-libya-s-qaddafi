Uganda  would consider a request by
Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  for political asylum in the East
African nation, though he hasn’t submitted an application, said
Henry Okello Oryem, minister of state for foreign affairs.  “If Qaddafi applies for asylum in Uganda, his application
will be considered like it is done for others under
international conventions,” Oryem said in a phone interview
today from Kampala, the Ugandan capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
