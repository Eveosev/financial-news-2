U.S. stocks rose, extending the
biggest first-quarter rally in 13 years for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index, as a report showing companies added more
workers in March bolstered optimism about the economy.  Cephalon Inc. (CEPH)  surged 28 percent for the biggest jump in the
S&P 500 after  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX)  offered
to buy the maker of sleep and pain drugs.  Visa Inc. (V)  climbed 2.8
percent on speculation that curbs on debit-card fees will be
delayed or modified.  AT&T Inc. (T)  rallied as its chief executive
officer pitched the company’s acquisition of  T-Mobile USA  as a
way to boost network capacity and improve service.  The S&P 500 gained 0.7 percent to 1,328.26 at 4 p.m. in  New
York  and is up 5.6 percent for the first quarter, which ends
tomorrow. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  increased 71.60
points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,350.61 and has rallied 6.7 percent
so far this year. The Russell 2000 Index of smaller stocks rose
1.3 percent to 840.28, the highest level since October 2007.  “Given the beginning of a strong cyclical recovery in the
U.S. and a tougher environment in many of these other
international markets, it seems to us like a good place for
investors to be,” said Connor Browne, who oversees about $5
billion as co-manager of the Thornburg Value Fund at Thornburg
Investment Management Inc. in  Santa Fe ,  New Mexico . “We’re
positively inclined toward valuations and fundamentals for the
U.S. market.”  First-Quarter Rally  The  S&P 500  is poised to complete a third straight
quarterly advance and is headed for its biggest gain in the
January-March period since 1998, when the index surged 14
percent. The benchmark gauge of U.S. stocks is trading for about
13.7 times its companies’ estimated operating earnings, compared
with an average multiple of 18.1 times reported profits over the
last decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A report from ADP Employer Services today showed companies
hired 201,000 workers in March, marking the third time in four
months that the nation added more than 200,000 jobs. A Labor
Department report on April 1 may show total U.S. non-farm
payrolls rose 190,000 in March and the  unemployment rate  held at
8.9 percent, economists predicted. The jobless rate fell below 9
percent in February for the first time in 22 months.  “There’s certainly some positive expectations for the jobs
numbers this Friday,” said Michael James, managing director of
equity trading at Wedbush Securities Inc. in  Los Angeles . “The
expectation is that the  U.S. economy  is going to remain strong
and the equity markets are going to continue higher,” he said.  Cephalon, Visa  Cephalon advanced 28 percent to $75.44 after Valeant,
 Canada ’s biggest drug maker, offered to buy the Frazer,
Pennsylvania-based company for $73 a share in cash. The offer is
valued at about $5.7 billion. Valeant rose 13 percent to $50.08.
 Forest Laboratories Inc. (FRX) , another drugmaker, climbed 4.3 percent
to $32.48.  Visa, the world’s biggest payments network, gained 2.8
percent to $74.23 after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said yesterday the central bank wouldn’t meet an April 21
deadline to come up with a final rule on debit-card transaction
fees. The cap, mandated by the Dodd-Frank law that overhauled
the financial industry last year, must be in place by July 21.
 MasterCard Inc. (MA) , the world’s second-biggest payments network,
rose 0.8 percent to $253.66.  AT&T Inc. advanced 2.2 percent, the biggest increase in the
Dow, to $30.71. CEO Randall Stephenson today said the
acquisition of Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile USA would boost
network capacity and improve service for devices such as  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone. The executive spoke at an event at the Council on
Foreign Relations in New York. Apple fell 0.7 percent to
$348.63.  PPG Surges  PPG Industries Inc. (PPG)  gained 5.9 percent to $95.93, its
highest price since at least 1980. The world’s second-biggest
paint maker forecast first-quarter profit of at least $1.30 a
share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.12.  Salesforce.com rose 5.6 percent to $134.49 after the
largest supplier of customer-management software agreed to buy
Radian6 Technologies Inc. for about $340 million in cash and
stock to add software that lets companies keep abreast of the
social Web.  BlackRock surged 6.6 percent to $198.84. The company will
replace  Genzyme Corp. (GENZ)  in the S&P 500 after the close of trading
on April 1, S&P said in a statement. Separately, Citigroup Inc.
added the shares to its “top picks” list. Genzyme, which is
being removed from the index because  France ’s  Sanofi-Aventis SA (SNY) 
is buying the company, dropped less than 0.1 percent to $76.01.  Coca-Cola  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  climbed 0.5 percent to $66.04 as the company
said its bottled-water plants in  Japan  are operating 24 hours a
day to meet increased demand because of concern that radiation
discharges from the country’s stricken nuclear power plant have
contaminated tap water.  Lennar Corp. (LEN)  slumped 4.2 percent to $18.27 for the biggest
decline in the S&P 500. Stephen East at Ticonderoga Securities
LLC cut the homebuilder to “neutral” from “buy.”  Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)  slid 3.8 percent, the second-biggest drop in
the S&P 500, to $18.45. ThinkEquity LLC analyst Krishna Shankar
lowered his price target for the maker of three-dimensional
graphics processors to $18 from $24.  Ameron International Corp. (AMN)  lost 6.6 percent to $69.82 after
the maker of fiberglass pipes posted a $4.3 million loss in its
fiscal first quarter ended Feb. 27 as poor weather hurt sales.  First-Quarter Gains  The S&P 500 usually climbs further following first-quarter
gains similar to this year’s, according to Birinyi Associates
Inc. The index rises about 7.1 percent in the final three
quarters of years following January-March gains of 5 percent to
7 percent, Birinyi data dating back to 1928 show.  The U.S. stock market is about to begin one of the most-
bullish months of the year, according to a March 28 note by
Bespoke Investment Group, a Harrison, New York-based research
company. The Dow has averaged an April gain of 4.2 percent over
the past five years, the note said. April has been the best
performing month for the past 50 years, it also said.  “People remain very bullish,” said Wedbush Securities’
James. “It’s been one of the strongest first quarters we’ve
had” in more than 10 years. “People want to make sure that
they show enough long positions in their portfolios going into
the end of the quarter tomorrow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
