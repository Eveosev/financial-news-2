South Korea ’s won rose to its
strongest level in almost seven weeks as overseas investors
added to their holdings of the nation’s shares for a 10th day,
the longest run of net purchases this year. Bonds declined.  Gross domestic product grew 0.5 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2010 from the previous three months, the  Bank of
Korea  said today in Seoul, confirming an earlier estimate.
Government data this week are expected to show inflation
accelerated to a two-year high of 4.8 percent in March and
exports rose 20 percent from a year earlier, based on the median
estimates of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The won climbed 0.6 percent to 1,104.10 per dollar as of
the 3 p.m. close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 1,103.85, the strongest level since Feb. 9.
The currency has strengthened 2 percent so far in 2011, after
appreciating in all but one of the previous seven quarters.  “Foreigners’ buying of the nation’s stocks is supporting
the won,” said Han Tae Gyu, a currency trader at  Shinhan Bank 
in Seoul. “Also, there’s no sign of intervention at 1,100
versus the dollar, a level which was believed to be important to
the government.”  South Korea’s three-year bonds fell, pushing the yield on
the 3 percent note due December 2013 up seven basis points to
3.77 percent, according to prices from the Korea Stock Exchange.
That’s the highest level since March 9. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
