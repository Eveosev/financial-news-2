The permanent European rescue fund
won’t allay investors’ concerns about peripheral nations’ debt
restructuring and may not prevent sovereign downgrades in the
short term,  Fitch Ratings  said.  “For so long as the ‘solvency’ of peripheral” countries
is “in doubt, the introduction of the ESM from July 2013 as a
senior creditor, combined with the political commitment to
ensure private sector ‘burden-sharing,’ potentially heightens
rather than diminishes market fears of a sovereign debt
restructuring, including on currently outstanding debt,” Fitch
wrote in a report today in  London .  The European Stability Mechanism will replace the temporary
European Financial Stability Facility which forms the lion’s
share of the 750 billion euro ($1.1 trillion) bailout pool
agreed by European leaders nearly a year ago.  The ESM has “not enhanced the prospects for so-called
peripheral” nations “to secure affordable market funding --
crucial if they are to exit from emergency support and place
public debt on a sustainable path and hence stabilize their
sovereign credit profiles and ratings,” Fitch said.  Fitch’s rival,  Standard & Poor’s , downgraded Portugal and
 Greece  yesterday, saying the European Union’s new bailout rules
may mean that both nations eventually renege on their debt
obligations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
