Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) ,
the casino operator  part-owned  by Permira Advisers LLP, expects
 Macau ’s gaming revenue growth this year will be “similar to”
that of last year, Deputy Chairman Francis Lui said.  “Macau market is growing rapidly,” Lui told reporters in
 Hong Kong  today. “Both VIP and mass market will continue to
grow. Mass market is increasing on rising income of the middle
class in  China .”  Casino  gambling revenue in Macau  climbed 58 percent in 2010
to about $23.5 billion, more than four times the $5.62 billion
for the  Las Vegas Strip , according to government data. The Hong
Kong-based casino operator said it will open the HK$14.9 billion
($1.9 billion) Galaxy Macau resort on May 15 to target middle-
class Chinese gamblers.  Galaxy’s profit, excluding the loss from a bond buyback and
accounting valuation of convertible notes, tripled to HK$1.3
billion last year, it said in a statement. Sales jumped 58
percent to HK$19.3 billion, the company said.  “The first quarter was a great start for 2011,” Chief
Financial Officer Robert Drake said by telephone after the
earnings announcement. Earnings before interest and taxes,
depreciation and amortization jumped 76 percent to a record
HK$625 million in the fourth quarter, he said.  Leisure Travelers  The casino operator expects its new Macau resort to help
increase revenue by at least 20 percent this year, Lui said on
March 10. “When we open the Galaxy Macau, mass market will
increase significantly,” Drake said.  Non-gaming customers, or leisure travelers, “have not yet
arrived in Macau,” Lui said. “We hope to attract these new
customers” who account for 55 percent of visitors in  Las Vegas 
and represent only 20 percent of arrivals in Macau, he added.  Net income fell 22 percent to HK$898 million in the 12
months ended Dec. 31, as bond buybacks that boosted Galaxy’s
earnings in 2009 pared income last year. That missed the HK$1.2
billion average of 13 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The new resort will house three hotels with a combined
2,200 rooms, more than 50 food and beverage outlets, a lounge
and night club, and a wave pool.  Galaxy closed unchanged at HK$11.52 in Hong Kong trading,
after the earnings announcement. The stock has climbed 31
percent this year, outperforming the 1.8 percent gain in the
city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
