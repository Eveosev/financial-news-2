Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. households fell 4.5 percent on forecasts of higher
temperatures in the  Rocky Mountains  and western states that may
reduce demand for the heating fuel.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to homes in the U.S. and
Canada shows shipments fell to 34 million dekatherms (33.1
billion cubic feet), according to data compiled by Bloomberg as
of 10:15 a.m. in New York.  Residences in the West and Rockies region were to receive
3.3 million dekatherms, down 21 percent from yesterday,
Bloomberg data show.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. power plants dropped 7.5
percent to 12.6 million dekatherms.  The low temperature in Denver early today was 32 degrees
Fahrenheit (0 Celsius), 3 above normal, according to  Weather
Underground  in  Ann Arbor , Michigan. The overnight low may be 38
degrees, 9 above normal.  Wholesale gas delivered into CIG-Mainline, part of the
Colorado Interstate Gas Company pipeline system in the Rocky
Mountains and the pricing point for Denver, fell 0.76 cents at
1:57 p.m.  New York  time today, or 0.2 percent, to $3.9923 per
million British thermal units on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
dropped 1.44 cents at 12:30 p.m. East Coast time, or 0.3
percent, to $4.2531 per million Btu.  To contact the reporters on this story:
