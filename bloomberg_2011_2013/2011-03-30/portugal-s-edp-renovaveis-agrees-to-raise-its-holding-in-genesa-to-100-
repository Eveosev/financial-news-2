EDP Renovaveis SA (EDPR) , the renewable-
energy unit of Portuguese utility EDP-Energias de Portugal SA,
said it agreed to raise its holding in Genesa to 100 percent.  EDP Renovaveis increased its stake in that company after
Caja  Madrid  exercised an option to sell its 20 percent stake in
Genesa, the unit of Lisbon-based EDP said today in a regulatory
filing. The price of the option was set at 231 million euros.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
