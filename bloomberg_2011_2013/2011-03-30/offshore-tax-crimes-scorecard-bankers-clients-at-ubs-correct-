(Corrects 31st paragraph of story published Dec. 15 to say
Goldstein has not entered a plea.)  The U.S. extended its crackdown on
offshore tax evasion, charging former  UBS AG (UBSN)  banker Renzo Gadola
with helping American clients hide assets from the Internal
Revenue Service by shifting them to a smaller Swiss bank.  Gadola, 44, was accused yesterday of conspiring with a
Swiss banker to encourage U.S. clients who hadn’t told the IRS
about their UBS accounts to open undeclared accounts at Basler
Kantonalbank. Gadola and the banker told clients not to join a
voluntary disclosure program that led 18,000 Americans to
declare offshore accounts to the IRS, prosecutors said.  The crackdown has led to criminal charges against UBS, the
largest Swiss bank, two dozen former clients, four former
bankers and two advisers. A former client of HSBC Plc,  Europe ’s
biggest bank, also has been charged, as well as a Swiss lawyer
who helped him.  Below is a summary of the charges involving UBS, filed in
