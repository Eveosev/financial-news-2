Greece  will examine all state
holdings as it seeks to raise 50 billion euros ($70.5 billion)
from state-asset sales and real-estate development by 2015,
Deputy Finance Minister Dimitrios Kouselas said.  The government is reviewing holdings in ports, public gas
company Depa SA, the Egnatia Odos highway “and stakes in
general,” Kouselas said in an e-mailed transcript of a NET TV
interview from the ministry. “Utilizing state property”
doesn’t just refer to state-owned companies, he said.  The government, which accepted a 110 billion-euro bailout
from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund last
year to stave off a default, wants to raise 15 billion euros
from state assets by 2013.  Piraeus Port Authority (PPA)  SA and  Thessaloniki Port Authority
SA (OLTH) , which run Greece’s two biggest ports, are 75 percent state-
owned. Greece hired three banks in January to advise on options
for its Depa SA stake.  Since December, 20 state properties have been identified
for the government’s development plan, Kouselas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
