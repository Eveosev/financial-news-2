Soybeans rose to a one-week high in
 Chicago  before a U.S. government report that may show farmers
plan to switch to sowing corn, tightening oilseed supply.  The area planted with soybeans in the U.S. may be 76.79
million acres this year, compared with the Department of
Agriculture’s February estimate of 78 million acres, according
to the average forecast of 32 analysts surveyed last week by
Bloomberg News. The USDA will release its acreage estimate
tomorrow in  Washington .  “Under average weather conditions, we reiterate our
outlook for higher soybean prices, where we see the highest
risks of a deficit,” Goldman Sachs Inc. analysts Damien Courvalin and  Allison Nathan  said in a report today.  Soybeans for May delivery rose 8 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$13.695 a bushel at 10:41 a.m. London time on the Chicago Board
of Trade after reaching $13.705, the highest level since March
23. The price has gained 41 percent in the past year on
increased demand for oilseeds from  China . The U.S. is the
world’s biggest soybean grower and exporter.  Corn for May delivery added 2.5 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$6.7425 a bushel. Areas seeded with the grain may climb to
91.751 million acres from 88.192 million acres last year,
according to the Bloomberg News survey. That would be the
biggest since 2007 and the second-largest since 1944.  “Corn will likely win the acreage intention battle,” the
Goldman Sachs analysts said. “Consensus expectations point to
lower inventories versus last year for corn, while slightly
higher for soybeans and wheat.”  May-delivery wheat fell 1.75 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
$7.355 a bushel. Sowing of the grain may reach 57.2 million
acres, up from the USDA’s estimate last month of 57 million
acres, according to the Bloomberg survey.  Milling wheat for May delivery was unchanged at 240.50
euros ($338.61) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris.  To contact the reporters on this story:
