Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for a
fifth day against the dollar, as the cost of borrowing in the
 interbank market  increased, making it more attractive for
investors to hold onto the East African nation’s currency.  The shilling appreciated 0.6 percent to 83.10 per dollar at
5:20 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital. The currency closed at 83.60
yesterday.  Overnight interbank lending rates increased to 1.5 percent
yesterday from 1.02 percent on March 28, said Steve Lagat, a
trader at Nairobi-based CFC Stanbic Bank Ltd.  That has “pushed banks to prefer holding on to the local
unit to avoid borrowing from the interbank window at relatively
higher cost,” Lagat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
