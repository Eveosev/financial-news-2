Thailand ’s onshore interest-rate
swaps advanced to the highest level in a month before a report
this week that is expected to show inflation accelerated to a
seven-month high in March.  Consumer prices climbed 3.1 percent in March from a year
earlier, after having increased 2.9 percent the previous month,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before the data is released on April 1. Central bank
Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said this week the bank may keep
raising borrowing costs to tame inflation after boosting the
one-day bond repurchase rate five times since June.  “On the inflation front, the central bank would probably
like to gradually hike rates,” said Disawat Tiaowvanich, a
foreign-exchange trader at Bangkok Bank Pcl, the nation’s
biggest lender.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, rose 0.5 basis points, or
0.005 percentage point, to 2.78 percent as of 8:40 a.m. in
Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
2.81 percent earlier, the highest since Feb. 28.  The baht was little changed before a report tomorrow that
may say the current-account surplus expanded to $2.7 billion in
February from $1.1 billion the previous month, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  The currency traded at 30.33 per dollar, compared with
30.34 yesterday. The baht has declined 1.2 percent this quarter,
poised for the biggest three-month slide since the period ended
March 2009, as overseas investors sold $351 million more Thai
equities than they bought during the period.  The Bank of Thailand increased its benchmark interest rate
this month by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.5 percent.  The yield on the 3.125 percent debt due December 2015 was
unchanged at 3.35 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
