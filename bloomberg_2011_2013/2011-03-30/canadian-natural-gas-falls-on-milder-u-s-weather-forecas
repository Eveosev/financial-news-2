Canadian natural gas fell amid
forecasts of milder weather in the U.S. North over the next four
days.  Minneapolis , which had a high of 44 degrees Fahrenheit
today (7 Celsius), will see temperatures reach the daily norm of
50 degrees April 2, according to AccuWeather Inc. Temperatures
will rise across the Midwest and Northeast next week, the  State
College , Pennsylvania-based forecaster said.  Alberta  gas for April delivery fell 2.75 cents to C$3.5675
per gigajoule ($3.48 per million British thermal units) as of
2:50 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet
market. May gas fell 0.75 cent to C$3.575 per gigajoule. Gas
traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada  and the
U.S., and is priced on TransCanada’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for May delivery rose 9.2 cents to settle at
$4.355 per million Btu on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.  Volume on  TransCanada Corp.’s  Alberta system, which
collects the output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.3
billion cubic feet as of 1 p.m. in New York, about 34 million
above target. Volume on the system, or linepack, fell 707
million cubic feet in the previous four hours.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 3.11 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.73 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 605 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.59 billion cubic feet today, about 72 percent of its
capacity of 2.2 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to  Vancouver  and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.87
billion cubic feet at 2:40 p.m. New York time. High linepack
prompted Spectra to warn shippers not to add more gas to the
system than their contracts allow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
