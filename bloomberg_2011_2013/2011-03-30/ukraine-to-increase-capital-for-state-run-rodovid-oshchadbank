Ukraine will increase the capital
of lenders PAT Rodovid Bank and VAT Oshchadbank by issuing

from Rodovid to Oshchadbank “to protect depositors,”
Yaroshenko told reporters today in Kiev.  The capital of Rodovid will be increased by 3.95 billion
hryvnia ($500 million), the minister said. Oshchadbank will get
additional capital of 604 million hryvnia, according to
