SK Innovation Co.,  South Korea ’s
biggest oil refiner, plans to buy an additional 2 million
barrels of crude from Japan next month after the March 11
earthquake reduced processing capacity.  The company will increase operating rates at its Incheon
complex units to use the crude from Japan, said the official,
who asked not to be identified because he isn’t authorized to
speak to the media. SK will process about 170,000 barrels of oil
a day in April and 180,000 in May, up from 140,000 barrels a day
this month. The Incheon complex has a capacity of 275,000
barrels a day.  SK said on March 16 it will buy 2 million barrels of crude
from JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. after  Japan ’s biggest refiner
closed plants in Sendai and Kashima in the northeast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
