Patents would be issued to whoever
files applications first and the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office would be allowed to set its own fees under a measure
introduced today in the U.S. House of Representatives.  The proposal, sponsored by Republican  Lamar Smith  of  Texas ,
is similar to one passed by the Senate in a 95-5 vote on March
8. If approved and made law, it would mark a fundamental change
in how patents are reviewed and the biggest revision to U.S.
patent law since 1952.  To contact the reporter on this story:
