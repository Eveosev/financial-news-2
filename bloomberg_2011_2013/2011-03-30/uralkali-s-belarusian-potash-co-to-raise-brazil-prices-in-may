Belarusian Potash Co., a trader
part owned by  Russia ’s OAO Uralkali, will raise prices for the
fertilizer by about 11 percent for buyers in  Brazil  in May
because of “unprecedented demand,” tight supply and higher
crop prices.  “BPC believes the same fundamental factors will continue
supporting very strong international demand through all of
2011,” the trader said today.  BPC will charge as much as $525 a metric ton for potash
from May, the trader said today in an e-mailed statement. That
compares with as much as $475 previously. The trader will sell
the material at about $520 a ton to large customers, according
to the statement.  “This is a very good contract for Uralkali and Belarusian
Potash, as they have 10 percent and 20 percent exposure on the
Brazilian market respectively,” said Elena Sakhnova, an analyst
at VTB Capital in Moscow.  Potash companies are increasing charges because of rising
demand as farmers seek to boost crop yields after produce prices
jumped.  Uralkali (URKA) ’s trading arm raised contract prices for potash
in  China , the world’s biggest consumer of the fertilizer, 14
percent in January to $400 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
