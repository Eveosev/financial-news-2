Turkey ’s main opposition, preparing
to take on Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in June’s
elections, met with U.S. Senator John McCain and aides to Vice
President Joe Biden in  Washington , Hurriyet reported.  The meetings marked the first high-level visit to the U.S.
capital by the Republican People’s Party, or CHP, since
Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party swept into power in
2002, the Istanbul-based paper said.  The party’s delegation was headed by Osman Koruturk and
also included Umut Oran, Faik Oztrak, Gulsun Bilgehan and a
former ambassador to the U.S., Faruk Logoglu, Hurriyet said.  “We’re the new CHP, and we’re open to the world,”
Koruturk was quoted by Hurriyet as saying at a speech to the
 Council on Foreign Relations . “We want to develop relations
with the U.S. that have gone through a problematic past ten
years.” Biden’s office requested a meeting, Hurriyet said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
