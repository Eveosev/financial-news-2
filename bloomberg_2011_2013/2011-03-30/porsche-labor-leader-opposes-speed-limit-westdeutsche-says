Porsche SE’s works council opposed
speed limits on highways,  Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung 
reported, citing the sports-car maker’s top labor leader.  “The majority” of residents of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the
southwestern German state that’s home to Porsche and Daimler AG,
opposes a speed limit, the newspaper cited Uwe Hueck as saying
in an article to be published in tomorrow’s edition. “The state
has other problems.”  The  Green Party  helped defeat  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s
coalition in the state’s regional election on March 27 on a
platform that includes a speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour
(74.6 miles per hour) to reduce vehicle emissions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
