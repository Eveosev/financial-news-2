The global economic recovery faces
“considerable downside risks,” said  Naoyuki Shinohara , deputy
managing director of the Washington-based  International Monetary
Fund .  The improvement will be led by emerging markets where
overheating and inflationary pressures in some countries are
being exacerbated by large capital flows and rising commodity
prices, Shinohara said today in Gaborone, Botswana’s capital,
according to the text of his speech.  Fighting in the Middle East and North Africa are boosting
 oil prices , which may harm the recovery if they persist at
current levels, he said. A broadening of financial industry
strains due to the sovereign and banking risks in the euro area
are adding to constraints on growth.  Oil is at more than $100 a barrel on supply concerns due to
an uprising against Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  and unrest in
other North African and Middle East nations, while a March 11
temblor and tsunami has hurt growth in Japan. Some countries in
 Europe  implemented austerity measures to contain national and
banking industry debt.  “In a nutshell, the good news is that we expect the global
recovery to proceed, led by emerging markets, but the not so
good news is that it will remain a multi-speed recovery with
considerable downside risks,” Shinohara said.  Botswana needs to reduce the size of its public service and
look for other engines of growth rather than relying on mining,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
