Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa has flown to  London  and defected today from the
government of leader  Muammar Qaddafi , a British diplomat said.  Koussa defected after arriving from  Tunisia , according to
the diplomat, who spoke on condition of not being identified
because the move hasn’t been publicly announced yet.  Koussa crossed yesterday into Tunisia through the border
post of Ras Jedir, the state-run Tunis Afrique Presse news
agency reported, citing its own correspondent. He came to
Tunisia on a “private visit” and not as an official guest, the
agency said, citing sources.  Koussa is not subject to the travel ban imposed by the
 United Nations Security Council  on Qaddafi and other top
government officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
