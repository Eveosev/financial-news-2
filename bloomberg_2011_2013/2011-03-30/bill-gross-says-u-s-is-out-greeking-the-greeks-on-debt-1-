Bill Gross , who runs the world’s
biggest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management Co., said
Treasuries “have little value” because of the growing U.S.
debt burden.  The amounts the U.S. owes on its bonds, combined with
obligations for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid total
about $75 trillion, Gross said in his monthly investment
outlook, published on the Pimco website. The U.S. will
experience inflation,  currency devaluation  and low-to-negative
 interest rates  relative to consumer-price gains if it doesn’t
reform its entitlement programs, Gross said in the report.  Gross “has been selling Treasuries because they have
little value within the context of a $75 trillion total debt
burden,” he said. “This country appears to have an off-
balance-sheet, unrecorded debt burden of close to 500 percent of
GDP. We are out-Greeking the Greeks.”  Treasuries have handed investors a 0.1 percent loss this
quarter, even after accounting for interest payments, based on
Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. The slide adds to a 2.7
percent decline in the final three months of 2010. Bonds fell as
President Barack Obama’s government increased the U.S. publicly
traded debt to a record $9.05 trillion.  Greece’s credit rating was cut two steps by Standard and
Poor’s March 29 on concern the country will be required to
restructure its debt.  Pimco, based in  Newport Beach , California, manages some
$1.2 trillion, according to Gross. It is a unit of Munich-based
insurer  Allianz SE. (ALV)   To contact the reporter on this story:
