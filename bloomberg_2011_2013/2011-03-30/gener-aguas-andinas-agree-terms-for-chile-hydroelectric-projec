AES Gener SA (GENER) , the Chilean unit of
Arlington, Virginia-based AES Corp., reached an agreement with
 Aguas Andinas SA (AGUAS/A)  over water rights for its Alto Maipo
hydroelectric project in central  Chile .  Gener will pay Aguas Andinas for water from the Maipo River
for 40 years once the project begins operations in 2015 or 2016,
according to an Aguas Andinas  statement  posted yesterday on the
website of Chileâ€™s securities regulator. The amount to be paid
will depend on rainfall levels and electricity prices.  The agreement also guarantees Aguas Andinas unrestricted
access to the El Yeso reservoir to comply with its Santiago
supply contracts, the statement said. Final contracts with Gener
should be signed within the next six months, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
