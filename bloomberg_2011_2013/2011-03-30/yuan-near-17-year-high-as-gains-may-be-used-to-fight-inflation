China ’s yuan strengthened,
approaching a 17-year high, on speculation policy makers will
tolerate appreciation to help contain inflation.  The central bank may raise  interest rates  once or twice in
the second quarter and exchange-rate reform may accelerate, Bank
of China Ltd. economists wrote in a report released today.
Inflation will average 4.9 percent in the first three months of
the year, exceeding the official 4 percent target for 2011, they
wrote.  “Beijing policy makers will stay with the gradual
tightening trajectory, which includes allowing the yuan to
appreciate at a rate of 5 to 6 percent this year,” said David Cohen, head of Asian forecasting at Action Economics in
 Singapore . He predicts the central bank will raise banks’
reserve-requirement ratios by 0.5 percentage point once in the
coming quarter and boost its benchmark interest rate by a
quarter of a percentage point.  The yuan gained 0.08 percent to end at 6.5559 per dollar as

25, the strongest level since the country unified official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993. In Hong Kong’s

bets the yuan will strengthen 1.8 percent from the onshore spot
rate in a year, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency will rise to 6.29 per dollar by the end of this year,
according to the median forecast of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Growth, Tightening  China’s central bank set the  reference rate  0.06 percent
stronger at 6.5586. The currency is allowed to trade up to 0.5
percent on either side of the daily fixing.  The economy will expand 9.2 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, Bank of China said in its report. Growth

percent for the year as a whole, the lender said.  China lifted  reserve requirements  for banks for the third
time this year on March 18, by half a percentage point, judging

largest economy than the effects of  Japan ’s earthquake and
nuclear crisis. Consumer prices in China climbed 4.9 percent in
February and January from a year earlier, according to official
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
