DryShips Inc. (DRYS) , a Greek owner of
deep-water drilling rigs and vessels that haul iron ore and
coal, reported that fourth-quarter profit rose as revenue from
drilling rigs gained.  Net income advanced to $99.7 million, or 29 cents a share,
from $9.6 million, or 2.2 cents, a year earlier, the Athens-
based company said today in a statement. Revenue rose to $215.8
million from $196.4 million.  The results included gains of $26.9 million in interest-
rate swaps and other items. Excluding those items, adjusted net
income was $72.8 million, or 20 cents a share. On that basis,
the estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 25 cents.  “There is no doubt that they will have revenue growth on
the drilling side going forward as oil demand increases, and
that’s what driving the stock now,” said Martin Korsvold, an
analyst at Pareto Securities AS in Oslo who has a “buy” rating
on the stock, before the earnings were released.  The company put its vessels under long-term charters during
the quarter to avoid volatility in the spot, or single-voyage,
market. DryShips diversified its revenue sources by entering the
offshore oil drilling rigs market through the 2008 purchase of
offshore driller Ocean Rig.  The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of spot shipping rates in
the dry-bulk market, averaged 2,364 in the fourth quarter, down
30 percent from 3,401 a year earlier, according to the London-
based  Baltic Exchange .  Shares Slip  DryShips fell 3 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $4.93 in Nasdaq
Stock Market composite trading. The shares have fallen 10
percent this year. The earnings were released after the close of
regular trading.  “As we move through 2011, we are seeing increasingly
attractive opportunities to purchase drybulk carriers and renew
and/or grow our fleet,” Chief Executive Officer George Economou
said in the statement. “Our strategy remains opportunistic in
this sector.”  Revenue from shipping was $113.5 million, down from $119.3
million a year earlier. Revenue from drilling contracts advanced
to $102.3 million from $77.1 million.  DryShips operated an average of 37 vessels in the quarter
that earned an average rate of $31,929 a day. A year earlier the
fleet averaged 39 ships earning $31,683 a day.  The company operated two drilling rigs during the quarter.
It took delivery of a new rig, the Ocean Rig Corcovado, in
January.  (DryShips will hold a conference call to discuss results
tomorrow at 8 a.m. New York time. To access the conference, call
