The U.K.’s  Civil Aviation
Authority  has extended price controls at London’s Heathrow and
Gatwick airports in anticipation of new government legislation.  Gatwick will cap increases in charges at a rate equivalent
to the retail  price index  minus 0.5 percent for the financial
year ending 2014, compared with the current rate of RPI plus 2
percent, the CAA said in a statement today.  The airport, acquired by New York-based infrastructure
fund Global Infrastructure Partners from BAA Ltd. for 1.5
billion pounds ($2.4 billion) in 2009, agreed the cap after
reaching a “negotiated settlement” with airlines, the CAA
said.  The cap for increasing airport charges at BAA’s Heathrow,
 Europe ’s busiest hub, will remain unchanged at RPI plus 7.5
percent, according to Andrew Teacher, a spokesman for the
company.  The prices that Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted,  London ’s
three main airports, can charge airlines are regulated by the
CAA and set every five years. The government will introduce
legislation to implement reforms early in the second session of
the current parliament, the CAA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
