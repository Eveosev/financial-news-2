Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  and
its former chairman, Richard Fuld, won dismissal of a lawsuit by
investors who claimed they lost money in a group of partnerships
set up as commercial real estate investment vehicles.  U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones in Manhattan, in a
March 28 order, granted Lehman’s request to dismiss the case
because the investors’ complaint didn’t state enough factual
allegations to support their claims.  “Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently plead any claim
for  securities fraud ,” the judge said.  The case involved 67 investors in four commercial real
estate partnerships Lehman created in June 2007. The investors
alleged that they weren’t told they would be exposed to losses
from properties Lehman had bought before the partnerships were
formed, which had fallen in value but weren’t written down when
they were transferred to the partnerships.  Arthur Russell, a lawyer for the investors, didn’t
immediately return a call to his office after regular business
hours.  The case is De Slaberry v. Lehman Brothers, 10-4299, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
