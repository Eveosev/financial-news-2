U.K. government officials are
seeking an agreement among the government, the major banks and
the  Independent Commission on Banking  in a bid to avoid conflict
after the April 11 publication of the commission’s interim
report on the banking industry, the Financial Times reported,
citing a senior government official.  The deal would also help ease tensions between the
coalition government’s Conservative and Liberal Democrat members
over banking reform, the FT said. In addition, it would lay the
ground for the government to begin selling its 41 percent stake
in  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and its 84 percent stake in Royal
Bank of Scotland Plc when the commission’s final report is
published in September, the FT said, citing the official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
