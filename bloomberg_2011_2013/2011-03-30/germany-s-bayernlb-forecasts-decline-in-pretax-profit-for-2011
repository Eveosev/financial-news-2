Bayerische Landesbank ,  Germany ’s
second-biggest state-owned lender, forecast lower pretax
earnings this year after returning to profit in 2010 on fewer
loan-loss provisions and cost savings.  BayernLB had pretax profit of 885 million euros ($1.2
billion) in the 12 months ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of
2.77 billion euros a year earlier, the Munich-based bank said in
an e-mailed statement today. The lender said it expects to be
profitable before taxes in 2011, though earnings won’t reach
last year’s level.  BayernLB, led by Chief Executive Officer Gerd Haeusler,
needed 10 billion euros of capital amid the global financial
crisis from Germany’s State of Bavaria, which now owns a 96
percent stake. The bank announced plans in 2008 to refocus
operations and reduce the workforce by 2013 as part of a revamp
to obtain European Union approval for the bailout.  The  European Commission , the EU’s competition authority in
Brussels, is investigating government bailouts on concern the
aid will give banks that had difficulties during the financial
crisis an unfair advantage in the future. The commission has
said it will evaluate BayernLB’s restructuring measures.  Chief Financial Officer Stefan Ermisch, 45, will leave
BayernLB at April 30, the lender said in a separate statement
today. He will be replaced by Stephan Winkelmeier, 43.  BayernLB reported a second consecutive annual loss for 2009
when it had to write off its investment in Hypo Alpe-Adria Bank
International AG after the troubled lender was nationalized by
the Austrian government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
