Gilts fell and the pound rose after
British reports unexpectedly showed the fastest services growth
since 2002 and rebounding retail sales, bolstering the case for
tighter monetary policy to stem inflation.  Short-sterling futures fell as investors increased bets on
higher interest rates. Services, which account for about three-
quarters of the economy, rose 1.3 percent from the previous
month, when they shrank 1.1 percent, the  Office for National
Statistics  said today. A gauge of sales rose to 15 in March from
6 in February, the  Confederation of British Industry  said.  “The service sector output data surprised to the upside,
suggesting the economy rebounded quite sharply in the first
quarter, which will provide ammunition for the hawks on the
Monetary Policy Committee,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , an
Edinburgh-based fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd. “If we see a rebound in first-quarter growth, those
members who have been advocating the hold strategy should be
convinced to move more towards the rate-hike camp.”  U.K. benchmark 10-year bond yields rose four basis points
to 3.67 percent at 4:33 p.m. in  London . The 3.75 percent bond
due September 2020 fell 0.29, or 2.9 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,609) face amount, to 100.67.  The January services growth, the biggest since July 2002,
was a “bounceback” after cold weather, the statistics office
said. In a separate release, it estimated that the government’s
budget will add 0.29 percentage points to inflation.  Fisher Speech  Investors today pushed forward bets on when the  Bank of
England  will raise its benchmark interest rate from a record-low
0.5 percent, money-market data showed.  The first 25 basis-point increase will be in July, and the
central bank will lift the rate to 1 percent in November,
according to forward contracts on the sterling overnight
interbank average compiled by Tullett Prebon Plc. They showed
the first move was priced for August in trading yesterday.  Short-sterling futures declined, pushing the implied yield
on the contract expiring in December six basis points higher to
1.47 percent.  Bank of England official Martin Weale yesterday said the
bank should raise rates because there’s a greater risk inflation
won’t come back to its 2 percent target. Policy maker  David
Miles  speaks in London tomorrow.  The pound advanced 0.2 percent versus the dollar to
$1.6042. It had slumped to $1.5937 on March 28, the lowest since
Jan. 31, on speculation that economic weakness would dissuade
the central bank from raising rates.  ‘Hawkish Comments’  Sterling strengthened 0.3 percent to 87.87 pence per euro
after reaching 87.53 earlier today. It appreciated 0.8 percent
to 133.13 yen.  “The pound is gaining a little support on the back of
hawkish comments,” said Elizabeth Gregory, a Geneva-based
market strategist at ACM Advanced Currency Markets. “In terms
of the resilience of the U.K. consumer, they’ve held up
remarkably well.”  The pound has gained 0.4 percent this year against a basket
of 10 developed-market currencies, lagging the euro’s 3.2
percent advance and beating the dollar’s 2.6 percent decline.  Gilts lost investors 0.6 percent this year, compared with
losses of 2.2 percent on German bonds and 0.3 percent on  U.S.
Treasuries , according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
