The Slovak government approved a
request by  Honeywell International Inc. (HON)  for 19 million euros
($27 million) in state aid as the company is building a factory
in the eastern European country.  The aid will take the form of tax breaks and cash
subsidies, according to a  document  approved by the government in
Bratislava today and posted on its website. Honeywell will spend
38.3 million euros on a car turbocharger plant, which will be in
eastern Slovakia and create at least 446 jobs by 2016.  Honeywell is following its car-industry customers which
have set up factories in eastern  Europe  to benefit from low
labor costs. The factory will have a capacity of 700,000 units
from 2013 and all output is set for export, according to the
government document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
