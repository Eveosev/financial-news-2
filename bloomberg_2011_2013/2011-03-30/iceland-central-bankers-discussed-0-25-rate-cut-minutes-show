Members of the Icelandic central
bank’s policy board discussed cutting the benchmark interest by
as much as 0.25 percentage point, according to minutes of the
bank’s March 15 rate meeting, published today.  “The governor proposed that the bank’s interest rates be
kept unchanged,” the minutes showed. “Four members voted in
favor of the governor’s proposal, although one member would have
preferred a 0.25 percentage-point cut due to indications of
slightly weaker economic activity than” the bank forecast in
February.  The central bank kept the benchmark seven-day collateral
lending rate to 4.25 percent on March 16, ending a cycle of 15
cuts since the north Atlantic island received a $4.6 billion
bailout from the  International Monetary Fund  in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
