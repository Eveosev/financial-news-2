Austria  plans to spend 1.7
million euros ($2.4 million) to restore and redesign the
Mauthausen concentration camp, where 200,000 people were
imprisoned by the Nazis between 1938 and 1945.  The project, to run through 2013, includes renovating the
station building, revamping the main exhibition, adding a new
display on the Holocaust and creating a “room of names” to
commemorate the camp’s victims, the Austrian Interior Ministry
said in a  statement  on its website today.  “We are demonstrating that the Republic of Austria is
aware of its national and international responsibility to
remember the victims of the Nazi regime,” Interior Minister
Maria Fekter said in the statement. “We are also taking a
stance against racism and anti-Semitism.”  Mauthausen is Austria’s biggest memorial against the
crimes of the Nazis and is visited by about 200,000 people a
year. Between 1938 and 1945, about half of the 200,000
Mauthausen prisoners died there, the memorial’s  website  says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
