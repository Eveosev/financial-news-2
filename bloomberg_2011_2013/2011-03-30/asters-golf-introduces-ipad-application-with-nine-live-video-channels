Golf fans with  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad
will be able to watch next week’s  Masters Tournament  live on the
handheld device as Augusta National Golf Club continues to
expand coverage of the event.  The  $1.99 application  will feature nine live high-
definition video channels, the only live digital simulcast of
 CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s weekend broadcast and on-demand video features and
highlights.  “We have always been intent on conveying the beauty and
excitement of the Masters in an innovative and enriching
manner,” Billy Payne, the club’s chairman, said in a news
release. “Each year, we continue to improve these offerings in
an effort to reach more people in more entertaining ways.”  Augusta National also enhanced its  Masters.com  website. It
will feature on-demand video, eight live video feeds and the
Internet’s only three-dimensional video stream for users with
3D-capable computers.  The club also released an application for  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
Android-based phones. Prior to the April 7-10 tournament,
organizers will also update their free iPhone application, which
features five live video channels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
