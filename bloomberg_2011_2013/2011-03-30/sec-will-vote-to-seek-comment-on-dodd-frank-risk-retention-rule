The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission voted to seek comment on a Dodd-Frank Act measure
that would require lenders and bond issuers to keep a 5 percent
stake in loans they package for sale to investors.  The proposal, part of a joint rulemaking with five other
federal regulators, was approved by SEC commissioners in a 5-0
vote at a meeting today. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and
the  Federal Reserve  released the rule for comment yesterday.  Lawmakers put the risk-retention provision in Dodd-Frank,
the regulatory overhaul enacted last year, aiming to eliminate
weak underwriting practices and risk-based incentives blamed for
fueling the subprime mortgage crisis. The proposal includes
exemptions for some business, auto, real estate and home loans.  In addition to the SEC, FDIC and the Fed, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development,  Federal Housing Finance Agency ,
and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also need to
approve the rule before it is formally passed.  The SECâ€™s public comment period on the proposed rule will
last through June 10, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
