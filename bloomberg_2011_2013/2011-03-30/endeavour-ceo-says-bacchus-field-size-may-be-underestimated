Endeavour International Corp.’s
Chief Executive Officer Bill Transier said the Bacchus field in
the U.K.  North Sea  may hold more than the current estimate of 35
million to 45 million barrels of oil equivalent.  “I think that may be an underestimate,” Transier said in
an interview today at an oil and gas industry conference in
Aberdeen,  Scotland . “Start with that number and go from
there.”  Endeavour owns 30 percent of Bacchus after acquiring a
further 20 percent stake from Royal Dutch Shell Group Plc in
February for $16 million. The field is adjacent to Forties in
the U.K. North Sea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
