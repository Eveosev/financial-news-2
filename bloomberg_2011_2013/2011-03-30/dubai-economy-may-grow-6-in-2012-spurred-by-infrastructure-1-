Dubai’s economy may grow 3.5
percent to 4 percent this year and 6 percent in 2012, spurred by
infrastructure spending and foreign investment, according to
Farouk Soussa, Citigroup Inc.’s chief Middle East economist.  The emirate is “blessed by prime location” and there’s
“real appetite” for investing there, he said at a conference
today. Infrastructure development, foreign investment and
geographical location are driving growth, he said.  Dubai’s economy, the second-biggest of seven that make up
the  United Arab Emirates , is recovering from the credit crisis,
helped by a revival in trade and tourism. Real gross domestic
product grew 2.2 percent in 2010, the statistics bureau said on
its website March 21. Growth is likely to accelerate to 4
percent this year, Standard Chartered Plc said in December.  While Dubai will see its recovery gain “traction” this
year, it needs more counter-cyclical fiscal policies, according
to Marios Maratheftis, a Standard Chartered economist based
there. “Dubai should consider some kinds of taxation,” he
said. It needs “more sources of revenues.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
