U.K. Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke said some overseas companies with London listings will be
exempt from the Bribery Act, the Financial Times reported,
citing an interview.  A listed company that doesn’t have a business in the U.K.
“will not in itself be covered by the Act,” Clarke said,
according to the FT. Guidelines for companies on staying within
the new law, which comes into force in July, will be published
today, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
