Global spending on  information
technology  will grow 5.6 percent to $3.6 trillion in 2011 helped
by purchases of tablet computers including Apple Inc.’s iPad,
according to Gartner Inc.  The new forecast, which compares with an initial figure of
5.1 percent growth, takes into account the surge in tablet
sales, the Stamford, Connecticut-based research firm said in a
 statement  today. Spending on tablets may rise to $29.4 billion
in 2011 from $9.6 billion last year.  Apple started selling the iPad 2 this month to stay ahead
of rivals running  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android software and tablets
from  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  and Research in Motion Ltd. Apple Chief
Operating Officer Tim Cook has said tablet sales will eventually
surpass personal computers.  Gartner is still evaluating the impact on spending from the
earthquake and tsunami in  Japan , Richard Gordon, a research vice
president, said in the statement. The firm is considering how
disruptions in the electronics supply chain will affect IT
demand, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
