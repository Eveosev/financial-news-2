Sellers of  Cephalon Inc. (CEPH) ’s bullish
options yesterday, before  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International
Inc. (VRX) ’s $73-a-share bid for the maker of sleep and pain drugs
sent the contracts soaring, lost on their trades.  Yesterday’s most-active options were August calls to buy
the stock at $70. They traded 3,799 times with 44 percent of
transactions on the bid price -- which indicates that sellers
initiated the trades -- compared with 33 percent at the ask
price. While those buyers saw a 10-fold one-day paper profit,
sellers now must pay $7.20 to the buyers of those calls, which
closed at 70 cents yesterday. Cephalon calls had the three
biggest percentage gains among U.S. options contracts today as
the stock jumped 28 percent to close at $75.44.  “While call volume was heavy yesterday, most of it appears
to have been initiated by sellers who will realize significant
losses,”  Henry Schwartz , president of Trade Alert LLC, a New
York-based provider of options-market data and analytics, wrote
in a note. “Most active were the August $70 calls, with several
thousand sold by a customer in the 50-55 cent range.”  Valeant made its cash offer of about $5.7 billion, or $73 a
share, public last night after its private approaches were
rejected, the company said. The bid for Frazer, Pennsylvania-
based Cephalon presents a 24 percent premium to yesterday’s
closing price of $58.75. If successful, the acquisition would be
the largest hostile takeover in the industry since Sanofi-
Aventis SA bid for Genzyme Corp. last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
