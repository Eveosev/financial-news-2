Turkish stocks climbed the most in
three weeks on a global rally as Chinese earnings beat estimates
and Japanese companies resumed production stalled by the
nation’s biggest earthquake on record.  The main  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  rose 801.3, or 1.3 percent,
to 64,565.63 at 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul, the most since
March 9. That trimmed the quarter’s loss to 2.2 percent.  “Stocks are tracking the global trend and are trying to
price in the optimistic sentiment and positive values,” Nezihi Abay, head of trading at Global Menkul Degerler AS in Istanbul,
said by telephone.  Global equities increased, sending  Asia ’s benchmark index
to the highest in more than two weeks, amid better-than-
estimated profits from Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. and
developer  Cheung Kong  (Holdings) Ltd. and as factories resumed
production in  Japan .  Yields on benchmark two-year bonds rose 2 basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 8.95 percent, extending their gain to
36 basis points since the central bank raised  reserve
requirements  on bank deposits last week. The lira weakened less
than 0.1 percent to 1.55685 against the dollar, falling for a
second day this week.  The central bank will continue to observe the effects of
its low rates and high reserve requirement policy and will take
extra measures should they be needed, the bank in Ankara said in
the minutes of its March 23 rates decision published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
