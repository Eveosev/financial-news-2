Breedon Aggregates Ltd. (BREE) , backed by
an investment vehicle partly financed by George Soros, plans to
target assets that may have to be sold by  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and
 Lafarge SA (LG)  as the two rivals combine their U.K. operations.  Anglo American and Lafarge’s 1.8 billion-pound ($2.9
billion) joint venture, announced in February, will likely have
more than 50 percent of the building-material market in central-
eastern England, Breedon Chief Executive Officer Simon Vivian
said in an interview.  “There will definitely have to be some divestments to make
that joint venture work,” said Vivian, the former CEO of
builder Mowlem. “Several hundred million pounds worth of assets
will be sold.”  Breedon will likely face competition for any assets that
Lafarge and Anglo American’s Tarmac have to sell, Vivian said.
For the time being, Breedon is considering smaller, family-owned
acquisitions. The company has 25 million pounds to spend, and
debt and equity could be used for larger purchases, said
Chairman Peter Tom, the former CEO of Aggregate Industries Plc,
in the interview.  Britain’s antitrust authority has already had a hand in
other building-material deals. Travis Perkins Plc opted to sell
stores in 20 local areas when it bought BSS Group Plc to avoid
being referred to a competition commission. Regulators are
currently considering the acquisition by Kingspan Group Plc of
CRH Plc’s insulation division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
