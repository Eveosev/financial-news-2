New Zealand  Refining Co. shut units
at its Marsden Point oil refinery for unplanned maintenance,
spokesman Greg McNeill said today, without providing details of
what work was done or when it was performed.  The maintenance issue has “now been resolved,” McNeill
said in an e-mailed response to questions. The 139,000 barrel-a-
day refinery 130 kilometers (81 miles) northwest of Auckland,
New Zealand’s biggest city, includes BP Plc,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 
and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  among its shareholders.  Diesel supply in New Zealand is “very tight” and the
shortage is likely to last weeks, the Otago Daily Times said on
its website, citing Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Bailey. The lack
of fuel is because of the Marsden Point closure and the shutdown
of refineries in  Japan  after the earthquake, the Times said,
without saying where it got the information.  “We produce diesel continuously at our Marsden Point
facility and right now are doing everything we can to help our
customers, including putting steps in place to increase” output,
McNeill said, without detailing the measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
