Former Chile national soccer team
defender Elias Figueroa won’t run against Sepp Blatter for the
presidency of the sport’s governing body.  Figueroa, who played in three World Cups, was considering a
campaign against the incumbent, but said that he didn’t have
time to organize before the June 1 vote. His decision means
Mohamed Bin Hamman, the head of  Asia ’s governing body, is the
only declared candidate running against Blatter for FIFA
president.  The time remaining to get nominated and campaign “was
insufficient,” the 64-year-old Figueroa said today in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
