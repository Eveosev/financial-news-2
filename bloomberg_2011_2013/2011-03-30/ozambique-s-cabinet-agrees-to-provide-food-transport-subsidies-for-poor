Mozambiqueâ€™s Cabinet agreed to
provide food and transport subsidies to poor citizens, Planning
and Development Minister Aiuba Cuereneia said.  The measures, which are aimed at cushioning the effects of
higher food and fuel prices, will be introduced between June and
August, Cuereneia told reporters after a weekly Cabinet meeting
yesterday.  Senior government officials will also not receive salary of
benefit increases this year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
