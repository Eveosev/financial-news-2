The following is the text of
the industrial product and raw material prices report as
reported by  Statistics Canada .  In February, the Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI)
increased 0.7% and the Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI)
rose 1.8%. Both indexes have been on an upward trend since
mid-2010.  The IPPI was up 0.7% in February, following increases
of 0.8% in December and 0.4% in January. The advance in
February was led mainly by petroleum and coal products
(+3.0%) and primary metal products (+2.5%). Chemical
products (+1.0%) and meat, fish and dairy products (+1.4%)
had more modest contributions.  Higher prices for petroleum and coal products in
February were in part influenced by reduced production.  In February, prices for primary metal products
continued their growth, supported by higher demand and
limited production. All primary metal products sub-groups
were up, particularly "other non-ferrous metals" (+4.7%),
nickel products (+8.7%) and copper and copper alloys
(+2.1%). The other non-ferrous metals group was pushed
upward largely by precious metal basic manufactured
products (+11.7%) and by silver and platinum (+6.9%).  The IPPI advance was moderated slightly by a 0.4%
decline in prices for motor vehicles and other
transportation equipment. The decrease was due mostly to a
0.6% appreciation in the Canadian dollar relative to the
US dollar.  Some Canadian producers who export their products to
the  United States  are generally paid on the basis of
prices set in US dollars. Consequently, the strength of
the Canadian dollar in relation to the US dollar had the
effect of reducing the corresponding prices in Canadian
dollars. Without the impact of the exchange rate, the IPPI
would have risen 0.9% instead of 0.7%.  In February, excluding petroleum and coal products, the
IPPI would have increased by 0.5%.  12-month change in the IPPI: The upward trend continues  The IPPI rose 3.4% in February compared with the same
month a year earlier, after advancing 3.0% in December and
2.9% in January. The gain in February was the largest
since the acceleration of the index that began in
September 2010.  In the past 12 months, the IPPI advance was driven
mainly by higher prices for petroleum and coal products
(+16.0%), primary metal products (+15.6%) and, to a lesser
extent, fruits, vegetables, feeds and other food products
(+5.0%).  In February, the 7.0% year-over-year increase in the
value of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar
dampened the IPPI advance. Without the impact of the
exchange rate, the IPPI would have risen 4.9% instead of
3.4%.  Prices for motor vehicles and other transportation
equipment, which are particularly sensitive to the
exchange rate, fell 3.5% in February compared with the
same month a year earlier, continuing the downward
movement that started in October 2009.  Year over year, if petroleum and coal prices were
excluded, the IPPI would have increased 1.8% in February,
the 10th consecutive year-over-year gain, and a growth
rate comparable with the rates observed in the previous
four months.  Raw Materials Price Index: Fifth consecutive advance  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) rose 1.8% in
February, primarily because of higher prices for non-
ferrous metals (+4.5%), animals and animal products
(+3.4%) and vegetable products (+4.7%).  Radioactive products (+12.5%), copper and nickel
concentrates (+2.9%) and non-ferrous metal scrap (+6.0%)
were the biggest contributors to the advance in the non-
ferrous metals price index. In February, prices for
radioactive products continued their upward trend, which
began in mid-2010, in part as a result of increased demand
on world markets.  Among agricultural products, the biggest contributors
were animals for slaughter, such as hogs-swine (+12.3%)
and cattle and calves (+4.4%), as well as grains (+8.0%)
and natural rubber and allied gums (+10.3%).  Following the 2.6% decline in January, mineral fuels
edged up 0.1% in February, moderating the RMPI advance.  Without mineral fuels, the RMPI would have increased
for the eighth consecutive month, rising 3.3% in February,
slightly faster than the 3.0% growth observed in December
and January.  Compared with the same month a year earlier, the RMPI
was up 11.0% in February, following a 9.6% gain in
January. Year over year, the RMPI has been on an upward
trend since November 2009. Higher prices for non-ferrous
metals (+28.5%), vegetable products (+41.5%), animals and
animal products (+9.0%) as well as mineral fuels (+2.3%)
were the main factors in the RMPI year-over-year advance
in February.  Year over year, if mineral fuels were excluded, the
RMPI would have increased 19.2% in February, its highest
growth rate since April 2007, when it rose 21.8%.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally unadjusted and
are subject to revision for six months (for example, when
the July index is released, the index for the preceding
January becomes final).  The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) reflects the
prices that producers in  Canada  receive as the goods leave
the plant gate. It does not reflect what the consumer
pays. Unlike the  Consumer Price Index , the IPPI excludes
indirect taxes and all the costs that occur between the
time a good leaves the plant and the time the final user
takes possession of it, including the transportation,
wholesale, and retail costs.  Canadian producers export many goods. They often
indicate their prices in foreign currencies, especially in
US dollars, which are then converted into Canadian
dollars. In particular, this is the case for motor
vehicles, pulp, paper and wood products. Therefore, a rise
or fall in the value of the Canadian dollar against its US
counterpart affects the IPPI. But the conversion into
Canadian dollars only reflects how respondents provide
their prices. Moreover, this is not a measure that takes
into account the full effect of exchange rates, since that
is a more difficult analytical task.  The conversion of prices received in US dollars is
based on the average monthly exchange rate (noon spot
rate) established by the  Bank of Canada , and it is
available on CANSIM in table 176-0064 (series v37426).
Monthly and annual variations in the exchange rate, as
described in the text, are calculated according to the
indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for example,
CAN$1=US$X).  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) reflects the
prices paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw
materials. Many of those prices are set on the world
market. However, as few prices are denominated in foreign
currencies, their conversion into Canadian dollars has
only a minor effect on the calculation of the RMPI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
