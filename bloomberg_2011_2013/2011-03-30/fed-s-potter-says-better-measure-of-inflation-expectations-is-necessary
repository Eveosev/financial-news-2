Federal Reserve Bank of  New York 
economist Simon Potter said a better understanding of how the
public forms its expectations for inflation would strengthen
monetary policy.  “Despite the importance of inflation expectations for
forecasting future inflation and economic activity and as a key
link in the monetary transmission mechanism, surprisingly little
is known to directly answer these questions,” Potter, executive
vice president and director of economic research at the New York
Fed, said in the text of remarks in New York today.  The New York Fed has been conducting research in an effort
to improve measures of inflation expectations, he said.  “A better understanding of the factors affecting
individual inflation expectations will also help evaluate and
predict the impact and effectiveness of central bank policy
decisions and communication strategy,” Potter said.  “The ability to do so is especially important at times
such as the current one, in which central banks have been
expanding their toolkits and conducting traditional as well as
nontraditional monetary policy,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
