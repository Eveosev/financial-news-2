(Corrects Xie’s title in first paragraph.)  China ’s plans for nuclear power are
unchanged by the March 11 quake and tsunami in  Japan  that has
caused a reactor crisis north of Tokyo, National Development and
Reform Commission Vice Chairman Xie Zhenhua said in Canberra.  China is reviewing its nuclear power plants to ensure 100
percent safety, Xie said during a visit to the Australian
capital. The events in Japan are likely to affect the global
development of reactors, Xie said.  “We are also facing difficulties developing non fossil
energies in China,” Xie said, citing high costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
