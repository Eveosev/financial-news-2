Niger inaugurates its new
parliament today for a term of five years following an election
on Jan. 31 that ended a year of military rule.  The parliament has 107 of its full complement of 113
lawmakers after elections in the northern Agadez region were
annulled due to irregularities. The vote will be held again on
May 16.  There are eight political parties represented in
parliament, which includes 14 women.  Mahamadou Issoufou, 59, who won the presidential election
on March 12 with 58 percent of the vote, will replace General
Djibo Salou, head of the military junta, next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
