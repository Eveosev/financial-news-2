Quinenco SA (QUINENC) , a holding company
owned by  Chile ’s Luksic family, rose to an eight-week high in
Santiago trading after reporting an 88 percent jump in annual
profit.  Quinenco climbed 3.9 percent to 1,725 pesos, the highest
price since Feb. 3. Chile’s IPSA index rose 0.8 percent to
4,594.19.  The company had net income of 292 billion pesos ($605
million) in 2010 compared with 155 billion pesos in 2009,
according to a statement posted on the website of Chile’s
securities regulator. The gain was partly due to the sale of a
stake in LQ Inversiones Financieras SA, a holding company
through which Quinenco controls Banco de Chile, according to an
e-mailed statement sent after the earnings report.  Quinenco was reiterated “buy” at brokerage firm Larrain
Vial SA yesterday. The company had a net cash position of 716
billion pesos as of December 2010.  “We are in excellent condition to pursue new
opportunities,” Chief Executive Officer Francisco Perez said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
