Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , the South
African bank controlled by  Old Mutual Plc (OML) , increased Chief
Executive Officer  Mike Brown ’s pay by 63 percent in 2010 after
he was promoted to the lender’s top job and profit grew.  Brown received total compensation of 12.46 million rand
($1.8 million), including salary of 4.79 million rand and a
bonus and deferred payment of 7 million rand, according to the
Johannesburg-based lender’s  annual report  published today. Brown
was paid 7.65 million rand in 2009 when he was chief financial
officer.  Nedbank, the fourth-largest lender in  South Africa , said on
Feb. 28 full-year profit in 2010 climbed 15 percent as non-
interest income increased and the lowest lending rates in 30
years helped consumers to repay debt. The bank forecast further
earnings growth in 2011, adding that the “worst of the cycle”
has passed with  interest rates  expected to remain on hold in the
first half of this year.  “Financial targets, which were set taking into account the
deteriorating macro environment, were largely met during 2010,”
Nedbank said in its annual report. “The year-on-year change in
the short-term incentive pool was broadly aligned with the
change in headline earnings.”  Nedbank’s outgoing CEO, Tom Boardman’s pay in 2009 rose 79
percent to more than 43 million rand, with the inclusion of his
share awards, making him South Africa’s best-paid bank CEO at
the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
