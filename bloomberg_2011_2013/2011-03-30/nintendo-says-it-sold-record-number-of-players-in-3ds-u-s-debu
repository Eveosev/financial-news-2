Nintendo Co., the world’s biggest
maker of video game consoles, said it sold a record number of
handheld players on the 3DS’s first day of sales in the U.S.  The sales figures were the highest day-one results for any
Nintendo handheld and will be released by NPD Group Inc. on
April 14, Nintendo of America spokesman Charlie Scibetta said in
an e-mailed statement.  The machine, which plays 3-D images without the need for
special glasses, went on sale in the U.S. and  Europe  in the past
week. The player sold about 371,000 units in two days following
its debut in Japan on Feb. 26, according to Tokyo-based
researcher Enterbrain Inc.  “Nintendo worked hard to get as much product as possible
to retailers on day one to meet demand, and we will continue
with these efforts,” Scibetta said in the statement.  Shares of Nintendo rose 0.8 percent to 21,950 yen as of
10:17 a.m. on the Osaka Securities Exchange. The shares have
lost 7.9 percent this year, after climbing 8.1 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
