Hungary’s budget deficit may exceed
150 percent of the annual target by the end of June,  Figyelo 
reported, without citing anyone.  The government expects revenue from extraordinary industry
taxes and the funnelling of private pension funds to the budget
to reduce the shortfall to its target by year’s end, the
magazine said in an article to be published tomorrow. Pension
funds may help the government post a surplus of as much as 4
percent of gross domestic product this year, Figyelo said.  Bloomberg News obtained an advanced copy of the article
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
