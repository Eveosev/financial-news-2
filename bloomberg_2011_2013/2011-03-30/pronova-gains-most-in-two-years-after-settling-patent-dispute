Pronova Biopharma ASA, the
Norwegian company that holds patents to Lovaza capsules sold by
GlaxoSmithKline Plc, gained the most in more than two years
after reaching an agreement with a drugmaker planning to make a
generic version.  Pronova rose as much as 19 percent in Oslo trading after
saying it settled a patent dispute with Apotex Inc. Under the
agreement, Toronto-based Apotex may sell its version in the U.S.
in the first quarter of 2015 or earlier, depending on “certain
circumstances,” Pronova said. Lawsuits against Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. and Par Pharmaceutical Inc. continue.  Lovaza, sold by Abbott Laboratories in 69 other countries,
had worldwide sales of 7.6 billion kroner ($1.4 billion) last
year and generated revenue of 1.64 billion kroner for Lysaker,
Norway-based Pronova, Hamed Brodersen, vice president of
 investor relations , said by phone. The capsules lower
triglycerides, a type of fat that can lead to  heart disease .  Pronova rose as much as 1.59 kroner, the biggest intraday
jump since October 2008. The stock advanced 1.24 kroner, or 14
percent, to 9.8 kroner at 2:16 p.m., giving the drugmaker a
market value of 2.9 billion kroner.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
