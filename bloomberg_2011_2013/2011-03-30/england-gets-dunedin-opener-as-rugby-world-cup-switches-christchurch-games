England will open its 2011 Rugby
World Cup campaign in Dunedin after organizers reallocated the
remaining matches that were moved away from Christchurch because
of last month’s earthquake.  The Six Nations champion will face  Argentina  on Sept. 10 at
Otago Stadium before taking on  Georgia  eight days later at the
same venue in another match switched from Christchurch,
organizers said today.  Australia  will now play its opening game against Italy in
Auckland on Sept. 11 and faces  Russia  in Nelson on Oct. 1.
Argentina’s Sept. 25 match against Scotland has been switched to
Wellington. As part of the rescheduling, Scotland’s Sept. 14
clash against Georgia was moved to Invercargill from Dunedin.  “Today’s decisions provide the certainty for the affected
seven teams, their fans and media around the rescheduled
matches,” Martin Sneddon, chief executive officer of Rugby New
Zealand 2011, said in a statement. “This has been a complex
logistical process.”  The two quarterfinals scheduled to be staged in
Christchurch, which was damaged by a 6.3-magnitude earthquake on
Feb. 22 that killed at least 160 people, had alreay been
relocated to Auckland. The 20-nation tournament starts Sept. 9.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
