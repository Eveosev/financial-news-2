South Korean manufacturers’
confidence dropped from a five-month high as a record earthquake
in  Japan  risks sapping demand from the neighboring country.  An index measuring expectations for April fell to 95 from
96 for March, the Bank of  Korea  said in a statement in Seoul
today. A measure of non-manufacturing companies’ expectations
dropped to 83 from 85.  Japan’s March 11 earthquake and tsunami have also hurt
 South Korea ’s consumer confidence, which declined to the weakest
level in almost two years in March. Still, steady sales are
likely to support South Korean companies, and the disaster may
help boost exports, said a Bank of Korea economist.  “Japan’s disaster must have dampened business confidence
but not as much as for consumers,” said Son Won, an economist at
the central bank who conducted the survey. “Some exporters
expect to gain more global market share as their Japanese rivals
suffer from production disruptions.”  The survey was conducted from March 17 to March 24 and was
based on responses from 1,609 manufacturers and 872 non-
manufacturers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
