Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , the
world’s largest international air-cargo carrier, and affiliate
 Air China Ltd. (601111)  have begun flights at a freight venture after
overcoming bureaucratic delays.  Operations started after the venture won the final
approvals, Cathay Director Ian Shiu said today in Beijing. The
transaction was completed on March 18, Air China said in a
statement yesterday. Cathay previously said it expected flights
to begin as early as October.  The venture will enable Cathay to add freight hubs in
Shanghai and Beijing to its home base in Hong Kong, the busiest
air-cargo airport. Air China may gain help from Cathay as it
competes with  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  and Korean Air Lines Co. for cargo
traffic in the world’s largest export market.  Cathay in February 2010 said it would to invest 1.7 billion
yuan ($259 million) in Beijing-based Air China’s cargo unit to
form the new venture. It will control 49 percent, including a
stake held through an offshore trust.  The carrier planned to inject four Boeing Co. 747-400
freighters and two spare engines into the unit to pay for the
deal, according to a Feb. 25, 2010 statement. Cathay and Air
China first proposed the cargo venture in 2006 alongside a
larger deal centered on Cathay’s takeover of  Hong Kong  Dragon
Airlines Ltd.  Air China owns 30 percent of Cathay, making it the second-
largest shareholder in the carrier after Swire Pacific Ltd.
Cathay owns about 19 percent of Air China, the nation’s largest
international airline.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
