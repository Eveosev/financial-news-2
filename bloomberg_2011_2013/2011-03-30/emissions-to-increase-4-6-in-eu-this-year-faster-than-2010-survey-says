Emissions from factories and power
stations in the European Union carbon market will advance 3.6
percent this year, outpacing 2010’s growth of 2.7 percent,
according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  The EU may say in a report tomorrow that emissions rose to
1.94 billion metric tons last year, the first increase in three
years, according to the median estimate of nine analysts
surveyed this month. Emissions in 2011 will probably increase to
2 billion tons, the survey found.  Companies in the six-year-old EU program, the world’s
biggest carbon market, are required to turn in allowances to
match each ton of carbon dioxide produced. Their emissions are
verified by audit companies after the end of each year.  Emissions from power generation and steel production
advanced in 2010, while the oil and gas, cement, lime and glass
industries reduced discharges of  greenhouse gases  linked to
climate change, said analysts led by Emmanuel Fages in Paris at
Orbeo, the carbon-trading venture of Rhodia SA and Societe
Generale SA. He estimated 2010 emissions rose 4.1 percent to
1.95 billion tons.  “The cold waves at the beginning and end of 2010 account
for a large part of the emissions increase, while the economic
recovery in 2010 remained modest and, most of all, energy-
light,” Fages said yesterday in an e-mailed research note.  The U.K.’s 2.84 percent increase in total greenhouse-gas
emissions last year, the result of burning more fossil fuels for
heating, was the biggest gain for at least two decades,
according to a provisional report from the government today. The
report includes emissions from motor vehicles, for example, that
are not included in the EU cap-and-trade program.  British emissions rose to 582.4 million metric tons of
carbon-dioxide equivalent from 566.3 million tons in 2009,
figures  published  by the U.K. Department for Energy and  Climate
Change  show. The gain exceeded the increase of 2.82 percent in
1996. The data published doesn’t extend beyond 1990, the base
year in the 1997  Kyoto Protocol .  To contact the reporters on this story:
