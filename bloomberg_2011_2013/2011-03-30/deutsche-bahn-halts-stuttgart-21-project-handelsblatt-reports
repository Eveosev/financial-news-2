Deutsche Bahn  AG has halted the
Stuttgart 21 rail project in Baden-Wuerttemberg after the Greens
and the  Social Democratic Party , which both oppose the
development, formed a coalition in the state,  Handelsblatt  said.  The railway company also decided not to grant any building
contracts for the project for the moment, the newspaper said,
citing Deutsche Bahn. The company will try to start talks with
the new state government in May, Handelsblatt said.  Baden-Wuerttemberg may face damage claims if the new state
government cancels the Stuttgart 21 project, Handelsblatt
reported, citing German Transport Minister Peter Ramsauer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
