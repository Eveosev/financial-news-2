Turkish police raided professors’
homes and confiscated more documents by researchers
investigating the influence of U.S.-based imam Fethullah Gulen,
 CNN-Turk  said, citing a religion professor who was targeted.  Police raided the house of Professor Zekeriya Beyaz early
today as part of a probe linking the murders of Christian
missionaries in 2007 to the alleged Ergenekon coup plot against
Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan , CNN-Turk said.  Beyaz, who had earlier been questioned for his anti-
missionary speeches, said the police were seizing documents
related to a book he’d written about dangers of the political
influence of Gulen in  Turkey , CNN-Turk said.  The homes of Professor Sahin Filiz and writer Abdurrahman
Kucuk were also raided, CNN-Turk reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
