Copper in  London  fell, putting it
on track for its worst quarterly performance in three quarters,
on concern global economic growth may slow after  Japan â€™s worst
earthquake on record and as  China  extends tightening measures.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange lost as much as 0.2 percent to $9,569 a metric ton, and
traded at $9,570 by 8:06 a.m. Singapore time. It is down 0.3
percent since the start of the year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
