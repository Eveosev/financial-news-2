President Jeffrey Lacker said some companies may try to avoid
being tagged by the government as critical to the financial
system even as they try to benefit from an implied federal
safety net.  “There’s going to be clear tension,” Lacker said in
response to questions today during a House Financial Services
subcommittee hearing on the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which
overhauled financial regulation. Companies are “going to want
to escape” designation by the Financial Stability Oversight
Council as systemically important, Lacker said without
identifying any firms.  Lacker didn’t comment on the outlook for the economy or
monetary policy. In his prepared testimony, he said regulators
should discourage firms from bypassing rules or taking on too
much risk by setting limits on creditor bailouts during the
wind-down of failed financial companies.  “There are risks in the long term because firms seen as
enjoying broad safety-net protection will have strong incentives
to take on excessive risks,” Lacker said.  One idea is to limit the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s
authority over winding down failing companies to ones that are
regulated as “systemically important,” Lacker said.  To have credibility, policy makers would have to allow
“significant creditor losses in cases in which they otherwise
might have provided support,” he said.  Lacker, responding to questions, said the law has the
potential to “distort credit flows” and “give rise to things
analogous to the housing boom and bust.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
