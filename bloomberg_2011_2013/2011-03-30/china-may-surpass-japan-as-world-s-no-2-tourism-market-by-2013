China  will probably overtake  Japan 
to be the world’s second-biggest tourism market by 2013 as
rising incomes and rapid economic growth spur travel,  Boston
Consulting Group Inc.  said.  China’s domestic and international tourism will increase 14
percent annually to 5.5 trillion yuan ($838 billion) in 2020
from last year’s 1.5 trillion yuan, Boston Consulting said in a
report released today.  Spending by tourists from China will grow almost fivefold
to 1.5 trillion yuan in 2020, or triple that of Japanese
tourists, the Boston-based consulting company estimated. Chinese
tourists spend almost half their travel budget on shopping and
prefer to buy luxury goods overseas or in Hong Kong and Macau,
it said.  Customers from greater China will account for 44 percent of
global luxury-goods sales by 2020 compared with 15 percent now,
CLSA Ltd. analysts forecast in a January report. Greater China
includes  Hong Kong , Macau and Taiwan.  Chinese shoppers also make purchases for family and
friends. More than half of mainland China’s outbound travelers
surveyed said they had lists of products they had to buy, Boston
Consulting said.  Boston Consulting surveyed 4,250 Chinese travelers, both
domestic and outbound, taking leisure and business trips, in 15
cities in the third quarter of 2010.  -- Michael Wei . Editors: Frank Longid, Terje Langeland  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
