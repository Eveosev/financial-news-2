Gasoline fluctuated after an
industry report showed supplies of the motor fuel dropped last
week while crude oil increased.  Futures swung between gains and losses after the  American
Petroleum Institute  said yesterday that stockpiles of the motor
fuel fell 1.95 million barrels last week while crude inventories
rose 5.69 million barrels. The Energy Department is scheduled to
report on inventories at 10:30 a.m. today in  Washington .  “The API showed a big build in crude oil, which is bearish
for the market,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston. “The market is waiting on the stats
later this morning. If gasoline were to continue to decline,
that would be bullish.”  Gasoline for April delivery rose 0.56 cent to $3.0514 a
gallon at 9:36 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
fluctuated between $3.0377 and $3.0521. The more actively traded
May contract gained 0.44 cent to $3.048. April gasoline and
heating oil futures expire at the end of floor trading tomorrow.  U.S. gasoline inventories probably fell 2 million barrels
last week, according to the median estimate of 15 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg News survey. Stockpiles in the week ended
March 18 sank 5.32 million barrels to 219.7 million, the fifth
straight drop and the lowest level in 11 weeks, according to
department data.  Supplies of distillates, including heating oil and diesel,
declined 112,000 barrels, according to API. The government
report is likely to show a 1 million-barrel decline, according
to the survey, from 152.6 million the prior week.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide,
increased 0.8 cent to $3.595 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its
website. That’s the highest price since Oct. 2, 2008.  Heating oil for April delivery rose 0.82 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $3.0497 a gallon on the exchange. The May contract
added 0.47 cent to $3.062.  To contact the reporter on this story:
