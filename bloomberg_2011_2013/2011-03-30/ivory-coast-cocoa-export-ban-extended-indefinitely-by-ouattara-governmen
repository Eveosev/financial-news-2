A ban on exports of cocoa and
coffee beans was extended indefinitely by presidential decree,
according to the government of Alassane Ouattara.  Ouattara on March 28 signed a presidential decree
suspending “coffee and cocoa exports as well as the payment and
the collection of related taxes and levies,” according to the
decree, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
