Belgacom SA (BELG) , the largest phone
company in  Belgium , said the remuneration bill for its seven top
executives including Chief Executive Officer Didier Bellens rose
36 percent last year, boosted by costs for a departure.  Management committee compensation amounted to 11.3 million
euros ($15.9 million) last year, including 984,886 euros in
costs related to the departure of Michel De Coster, who left the
company in August, according to Belgacom’s  annual report 
published today on its website. The executive compensation bill
in 2009 was 8.31 million euros.  The aggregate compensation figures cover social-security
costs, base and variable pay, short-term and post-employment
benefits including medical insurance, insurance and pension
plan, as well as stock-based remuneration, according to the
report. Individual pay wasn’t disclosed.  Share-based compensation rose to 2.45 million euros from
1.92 million euros, while short-term employee benefits including
base and variable pay increased to 5.88 million euros from 5.08
million euros, according to the report.  Bart Van Den Meersche joined the management committee in
January, bringing the executive team back to seven.  To contact the reporter on this story:
