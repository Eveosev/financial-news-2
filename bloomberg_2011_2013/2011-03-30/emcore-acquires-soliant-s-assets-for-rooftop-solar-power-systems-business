Emcore Corp. (EMKR) , a New Mexico maker of
fiber optic and solar photovoltaic products, acquired “certain
assets” of commercial rooftop concentrated photovoltaic systems
company  Soliant Energy .  Emcore bought equipment, inventory, software, licenses,
intellectual property, and tooling and didn’t assume any
liabilities of Monrovia, California-based Soliant, Emcore said
in a statement. Terms of the transaction weren’t disclosed.  Albuquerque-based Emcore will integrate the former Soliant
research and development and pilot production line into its
existing facilities located in Alhambra, California.  The integration with Emcore will allow Soliant to leverage
Emcore’s solar cell supply and its low-cost manufacturing
infrastructure, Rick Russell, former vice president of
engineering and operations for Soliant and new vice president of
engineering for Emcore Rooftop CPV System, said in the
statement.  Manufacturing operations are expected to be transferred to
Emcore’s Suncore, a Huainan, China-based low-cost manufacturing
joint venture, Emcore said.  Emcore rose as high as 6 percent before closing 7 cents, or
3 percent, higher at $2.38 a share today in Nasdaq Composite
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
