Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-controlled oil producer, said it will start “gradually”
increasing output at its largest field this week after
installing a system to limit the burning of natural gas.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based company is known,
will also connect the Lula field to a natural-gas pipeline in
mid-May and start shipping gas to the mainland by the end of
that month, Petrobras said today in an e-mailed response to
questions. The pipeline will avoid having to burn gas, known as
flaring, which is limited to reduce air pollution.  Petrobras will connect a well to inject gas back into the
reservoir this week. The injection well and the pipeline will
allow the company to add additional production wells and
increase output without flaring, Nelson Silva, the head of  BG
Group Plc (BG/) ’s Brazil operations, said in an interview March 25.
Reading, England-based BG has a stake in the Lula field.  Petrobras expects output from offshore fields including
Lula, formerly known as Tupi, to double the company’s production
by 2020. Lula, with recoverable reserves of 6.5 billion barrels,
is Brazil’s second-largest field, and trails the government’s
nearby Libra field that holds as much as 15 billion barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
