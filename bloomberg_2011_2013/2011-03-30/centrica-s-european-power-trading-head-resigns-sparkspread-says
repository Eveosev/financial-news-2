Centrica Plc (CNA) ’s head of European
power trading Klaus Nussgruber resigned from his post less than
a year after joining as the U.K.’s biggest energy supplier
withdrew from the continent, SparkSpread said.  Nussgruber joined Centrica Energy Trading, formerly Accord
Energy, in May last year and was responsible for power trading,
origination and marketing across mainland  Europe , the energy
news website said today.  Centrica, based in Winsdor, England, completed its
withdrawal from the European mainland this month after it sold
assets in Belgium and  Spain . Eneco Holding NV, the third-biggest
Dutch utility, agreed to buy Oxxio BV from Centrica Plc for 72
million euros ($101 million), the companies said on March 24.  Centrica spokesman Julian Mears declined to comment when
reached by Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
