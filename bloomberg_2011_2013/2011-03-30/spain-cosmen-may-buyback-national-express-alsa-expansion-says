Elliott Advisors UK Ltd. may seek
the separation of  National Express Group Plc (NEX) ’s businesses, a
move that would allow the Spanish Cosmen family to buy back the
Alsa unit,  Expansion  reported, citing a letter from Elliott.  The Cosmen family,  National Express ’ largest shareholder
with a 17.08 percent stake, would be in a privileged position to
buy back Alsa, the newspaper said. Alsa is the Spanish bus unit
of National Express; the U.K. transport operator bought Alsa in
2005 for 600 million euros ($845 million), the newspaper said.  Elliott, the second-largest shareholder in National
Express, proposed to name three new independent directors
yesterday as it looks to sell its U.K. bus and train businesses,
Expansion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
