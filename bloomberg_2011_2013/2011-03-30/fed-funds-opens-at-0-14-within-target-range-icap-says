Fed funds, the U.S. overnight
inter-bank lending rate, opened at 0.14 percent, within the
 Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.1 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.07 percent to 0.19 percent and averaging 0.12 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire Treasury notes due from
October 2013 to February 2015 today as part of its plan to
purchase $600 billion more Treasuries through June and reinvest
its maturing mortgage holdings. The Fed expects to reinvest $250
billion to $300 billion of proceeds from mortgage-backed debt
and agency securities into Treasuries during that time.  The central bank plans to purchase between $5.5 and $7.5
billion securities today, according to the Federal Reserve Bank
of  New York ’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
