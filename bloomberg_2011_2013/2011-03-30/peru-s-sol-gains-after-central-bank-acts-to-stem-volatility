Peru’s sol gained for the first
time in five days after the central bank issued securities to
stem volatility in the currency before the first round of
presidential elections.  The sol gained 0.2 percent to 2.8090 per  U.S. dollar  at
11:41 a.m. New York time, from 2.8145 yesterday.  The Andean nation’s central bank sold sol-indexed
certificates of deposit this week for the first time since 2009
after concern about the outcome of the April 10 vote spurred
demand for dollars. The bank sold 300 million soles ($107
million) of three-month certificates on March 28 after the sol
slumped the most in 21 months. It offered 200 million soles
yesterday, but declared the auction null and void.  “Once the central bank began offering the certificates, it
reassured foreign investors, who became less desperate to buy
dollars,” said Gonzalo Navarro, head trader at  Banco Santander 
in Lima. “Buyers are now much more selective with their
purchase prices,” Navarro said.  The sol also gained as exporters sold dollars to pay local
profit taxes, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
