Barwa Al-Khor, an arm of Qatar’s
 Barwa Real Estate Co (BRES) , signed a leasing agreement with Pearl GTL
for a new residential housing compound to be built in the
Persian Gulf emirate.  The compound will provide housing for employees of the
Pearl GTL plant, Barwa said in a  release  posted on the Qatar
Exchange today. The housing compound will be part of Barwa’s 30
billion riyal ($8.2 billion) Urjuan waterfront development in
Al-Khor.  The Pearl plant, located 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of
Al-Khor in the industrial city Ras Laffan, will be the world’s
largest plant producing liquid fuels from gas when it becomes
operational this year. The plant is being constructed by  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)   Barwa said in January it was moving ahead with Urjuan after
saying in August that the project was put on hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
