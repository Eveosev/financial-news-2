Billionaire Thomas J. Barrack Jr.’s
Colony Capital LLC is investing $18 million in real estate
brokerage  Grubb & Ellis Co. (GBE) , which said earlier this month it’s
considering a sale or merger.  As part of the financing agreement, Colony will evaluate a
larger investment during an exclusive, 60-day negotiating
period,  Santa Ana , California-based Grubb & Ellis said today in
a statement.  Grubb & Ellis said on March 21 it hired JMP Securities LLC
to consider “strategic alternatives” after receiving
unsolicited inquiries. The brokerage’s market value has dropped
24 percent to $52 million since the announcement was made. The
company helps clients lease, buy, sell and manage commercial
real estate.  “We will work with Colony over the next 60 days as they
focus on a possible larger strategic transaction,” Thomas D’Arcy, president and chief executive officer, said in the
statement.  Caroline Luz, a spokeswoman for Colony, said the  Santa
Monica , California-based firm declined to comment.  Grubb & Ellis has the right to solicit competing offers for
25 business days should it enter a definitive agreement with
Colony on a larger investment, the brokerage said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
