BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the worldâ€™s
biggest mining company, began an initial study into the
expansion of the Olympic Dam project in  Australia  and expects
government decisions on approval in the second half.  The expansion will boost annual copper output to 750,000
metric tons over 30 years from 180,000 tons, the Melbourne-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. An expansion may
cost as much as $40 billion, Morgan Stanley has said.  The planned development would make Olympic Dam the largest
uranium and fourth-largest copper and gold mine, the South
Australian government said last year. Metal prices in  London 
have almost doubled in the past two years.  BHP gained 2 percent to A$45.61 at the 4:10 p.m. close in
Sydney trading. The stock has gained 17 percent in the past six
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
