The French Grand Prix may return to
the Formula One calendar in 2013 for a first time in five years,
the British Broadcasting Corp. cited  Bernie Ecclestone , the
sport’s chief executive officer, as saying.  Ecclestone said “we are ready to sign a contract,”
although a decision would have to be made on which circuit could
host the event,  according to the BBC .  Le Castellet in the south of France, or Magny-Cours in the
center of the country are the two circuit options, the BBC said.
The French government has said it will not contribute
financially to any proposal to host a Grand Prix, the BBC added.  This month, a race in New Jersey was postponed a year until
2014 which may create a spot in next year’s schedule, the BBC
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
