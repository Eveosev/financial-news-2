JSW Steel Ltd.,  India ’s third-
biggest producer, returned to profit in the second quarter after
increasing production and benefiting from a one-time foreign-
exchange gain.  Group  net income  was 6.91 billion rupees ($128.5 million)
in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a 6.69
billion-rupee loss a year earlier, the Mumbai-based company said
yesterday in a statement. The median estimate of 28 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of 4.62 billion rupees.
Sales climbed 17 percent to 94.75 billion rupees.  Production at  JSW’s (JSTL)  biggest factory, in Karnataka, rose 25
percent in the quarter to 2.17 million metric tons from a year
earlier after it secured iron ore supplies from government
auctions of the raw material. The nation’s top court, which
banned mining in the southern Indian state in August last year
pending investigations into violations of environmental norms,
allowed limited sales of  iron ore  to steelmakers in the state.  Earnings were boosted by a foreign-exchange gain of 4.24
billion rupees. JSW had incurred a foreign-exchange loss of 4.86
billion rupees in the second quarter last year.  JSW  shares  gained as much as 2 percent to 748 rupees in
Mumbai and traded at 746 rupees as of 10:52 a.m. The stock has
rallied 47 percent this year,  compared with  a 21 percent advance
in the benchmark BSE India Sensitive Index. Unit JSW Ispat Steel
Ltd. gained as much as 5.1 percent, the most since Sept. 21, to
10.4 rupees and traded at 10.1 rupees.  Total costs at JSW, in which  Japan ’s second-biggest
steelmaker  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411)  holds a 15 percent stake, increased
18 percent to 85.29 billion rupees in the quarter, according to
the statement. Tax expenses rose more than fivefold to 3.36
billion rupees.  The company benefited from lower costs of coking coal,
another key steelmaking ingredient, last quarter. Quarterly
contract prices of coal fell 25 percent to $225 a ton in the
three months ended Sept. 30, faster than a 19 percent increase
in prices of global benchmark hot-rolled coils used to make flat
steel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
