The New York Giants pulled out a 29-
24 road win against the division-rival  Dallas  Cowboys after
blowing a 23-0 second-quarter lead, while the New York Jets were
routed by the Miami Dolphins 30-9 at home after falling behind
20-0 in the first half.  The Giants got a pair of fourth-quarter field goals from
Lawrence Tynes after Dallas had scored 24 straight points to
grab a 24-23 third-quarter lead yesterday. The Giants then held
on for their fourth straight National Football League victory at
Cowboys Stadium as Dallas failed to score a go-ahead touchdown
on its final two drives.  Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, who passed for 437 yards,
threw his fourth interception of the game at the Giants’ 17-yard
line with one minute, three seconds left.  The Cowboys got the ball back again and Dez Bryant out-
jumped two Giants defenders to catch a 37-yard pass in the end
zone with 10 seconds remaining. The initial ruling of a
touchdown was overturned after video review showed the fingers
on Bryant’s right hand touched the back line of the end zone
before his body hit the ground inbounds.  “Every time we come here it’s a nail-biter in some way,
shape or form,” Giants coach Tom Coughlin, whose previous three
wins in Dallas came by a combined 111-100 score, told reporters.
“We’re happy to win and be on our way home.”  The Giants improved to 6-2 and avenged their 24-17 home
loss to the Cowboys in the opening game of the season.  The Cowboys fell to 3-4 and are tied with the Philadelphia
Eagles for second place in the National Football Conference’s
Eastern Division. The Eagles lost 30-17 yesterday to the Atlanta
Falcons, who at 7-0 are the NFL’s only undefeated team.  Manning Wins  Peyton Manning outdueled Drew Brees in last night’s game as
the Denver Broncos rolled past the New Orleans Saints 34-14.
Manning passed for 305 yards and three touchdowns, including two
to Eric Decker, as the Broncos improved to 4-3 and dropped the
Saints to 2-5. Brees had 213 passing yards.  The Chicago Bears beat the Carolina Panthers 23-22 on a 41-
yard field goal by Robbie Gould as time expired to improve their
record to 6-1. The Bears scored 16 fourth-quarter points to stay
unbeaten at home and send the Panthers (1-6) to their fifth
straight defeat.  The New England Patriots stayed atop the AFC East at 5-3
after scoring 45 straight points in a 45-7 rout of the St. Louis
Rams at Wembley Stadium in  London . Tom Brady passed for 304
yards and four touchdowns as the Patriots totaled at least 350
total yards for the 17th straight game, breaking an NFL record
held by the 1999-2000 Rams.  Other Games  In yesterday’s other games, it was Cleveland 7, San Diego 6;
Detroit 28, Seattle 24; Oakland 26, Kansas City 16; Pittsburgh
27, Washington 12; Green Bay 24, Jacksonville 15; and
Indianapolis 19, Tennessee 13 in overtime.  The Week 8 schedule, which began with Tampa Bay beating
Minnesota 36-17 on Oct. 25, concludes tonight with the San
Francisco 49ers at the  Arizona  Cardinals. Buffalo, Cincinnati,
Baltimore and Houston don’t play this week.  The Dolphins overcame an injury to quarterback Ryan Tannehill to win their third straight game and drop the Jets to
last place in the American Football Conference East Division.  The Dolphins recovered an onsides kick, scored a touchdown
off a blocked punt and also blocked a field goal in opening a
20-0 halftime lead at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New
Jersey. The Jets were held to 45 yards on their first 22 plays.  Jets Sputter  “We didn’t get it going early, we just sputtered around,”
Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez said at a news conference. “We
just had too many mistakes. It was all just average and they
took advantage of our mistakes.”  Olivier Vernon, Daniel Thomas and Anthony Fasano scored
touchdowns for the Dolphins, who improve to 4-3 with their third
road win this season. The Jets, who have now lost three times at
home, drop to 3-5.  “It was set up for us to go into this bye week feeling
good, get back to .500 and be right where we want to be in our
division,” Sanchez said. “Now we’ve made things difficult.”  Dolphins backup quarterback Matt Moore completed 11 of 19
pass attempts for 131 yards and one touchdown after Tannehill
left the game in the first quarter with a left leg injury.
Sanchez connected with 28 of his 54 passes for 283 yards, one
touchdown and one interception.  “To say I didn’t see this coming is an understatement,”
Jets coach Rex Ryan said. “We were all looking forward to this
game, but in this league you have to execute and Miami out-
executed us without question. They made some plays early in the
game and we couldn’t recover.”  Giants’ Lead  In Dallas, the Giants opened up a 23-0 lead less than two
minutes into the second quarter by taking advantage of three
interceptions thrown by Romo.  Jason Pierre-Paul  returned the
third interception 28 yards for a score 1:55 into the second
quarter to quiet the Dallas crowd.  The Cowboys cut the deficit to 23-10 at halftime and took a
24-23 lead in the third quarter as Romo scored on a 1-yard run
and threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to John Phillips.  The Giants regained the lead with field goals on their
first two possessions of the fourth quarter, the second coming
after a fumble by Cowboys running back Felix Jones. Dallas
finished with six turnovers.  “You can’t just battle, you have to find ways to win,”
said Cowboys tight end Jason Witten, who had a team-record 18
receptions for 167 yards. “You’re at that point in the season
where you have to start putting wins together.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
