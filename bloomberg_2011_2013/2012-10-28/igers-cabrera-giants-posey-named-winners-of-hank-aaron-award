Miguel Cabrera  of the  Detroit Tigers 
and the  San Francisco Giants ’ Buster Posey were given the 2012
Hank Aaron Awards, the first time both winners were meeting in
the  World Series .  The Giants lead the Tigers three games to none in the best-
of-seven World Series following last night’s 2-0 victory at
Comerica Park in Detroit.  The award recognizes the outstanding offensive players in
each league. It was created in 1999 to honor the 25th
anniversary of Aaron breaking  Babe Ruth ’s all-time home run
record.  Fans and a Hall of Fame panel of Aaron, who hit his 715th
home run to break Ruth’s record on April 8, 1974, Tony Gwynn,
Paul Molitor, Joe Morgan and Robin Yount voted for the winners.  “Miguel joined historic company this year by winning the
game’s first Triple Crown in 45 years, and Buster was a
consistent force in returning to the field triumphantly this
year,” Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement.  Cabrera, 29, ended the longest gap between Triple Crown
winners in baseball history. He led the  American League  with
a .330 batting average, 44 home runs and 139 runs batted in.  Cabrera is the fourth consecutive Triple Crown winner to
lead his club to the World Series, following Hall of Famers
 Mickey Mantle  (1956), Frank Robinson (1966) and Carl Yastrzemski
(1967).  Posey, 25, whose .336 batting average led all of  Major
League Baseball , became the first National League catcher to win
the batting title since Ernie Lombardi of the Boston Braves in
1942. He led the Giants in home runs (24), RBI (103), doubles
(39), walks (69), on-base percentage (.408) and slugging (.549).  Posey, the 2010 National League Rookie of the Year, played
in 45 games in 2011 before breaking his leg in a home-plate
collision on May 25, 2011, against the Florida Marlins.  Previous Aaron winners include Jose Bautista and Matt Kemp
(2011), Bautista and Joey Votto (2010), Derek Jeter and Albert Pujols (2009), Aramis Ramirez and Kevin Youkilis (2008), Alex Rodriguez and Prince Fielder (2007), Jeter and Ryan Howard
(2006), David Ortiz and Andruw Jones (2005), Manny Ramirez and
Barry Bonds (2004), Rodriguez and Pujols (2003), Rodriguez and
Bonds (2001-02), Carlos Delgado and Todd Helton (2000) and Manny
Ramirez and Sammy Sosa (1999).  To contact the reporter on this story:
