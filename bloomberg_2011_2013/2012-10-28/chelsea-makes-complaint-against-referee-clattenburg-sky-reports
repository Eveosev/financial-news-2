Premier League leader Chelsea made a
formal complaint against referee Mark Clattenburg for allegedly
using “inappropriate language” to two of its players in the
home defeat to Manchester United today, Sky reported.  Two Chelsea players were red-carded as the Blues lost 3-2.
The team didn't identify the players concerned in the complaint.  “We have lodged a complaint to the Premier League match
delegate with regards to inappropriate language used by the
referee and directed at two of our players in two separate
incidents in today’s match,” Sky cited a club spokesman as
saying. “The match delegate will pass the complaint to the
Football Association. We will make no further comment at this
time.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
