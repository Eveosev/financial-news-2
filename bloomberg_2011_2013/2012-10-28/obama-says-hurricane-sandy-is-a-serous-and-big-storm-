President  Barack Obama  said
Hurricane Sandy is a “serious and big storm” and urged those
affected “to take this very seriously” and follow the advice
of state and local officials.  “We don’t know yet where it’s gonna hit,” the president
said after a meeting at the Federal Emergency Management Agency
in  Washington  with the various agencies involved. The storm may
be “slow moving,” he said.  Asked if the storm will affect voting in the Nov. 6
elections, Obama said, “We don’t anticipate that at this point,
but we’re oviously going to have to take a look.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
