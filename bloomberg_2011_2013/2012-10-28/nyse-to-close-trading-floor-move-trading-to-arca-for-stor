The  New York  Stock Exchange said it
will shut its trading floor starting tomorrow and invoke
contingency plans to move all trading to NYSE Arca, its
electronic exchange, as Hurricane Sandy heads toward the city.  “The re-opening of physical trading floor operations is
subject to city and state determinations and local conditions;
updates will be forthcoming,”  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  said in a statement
today.  NYSE Amex Options will open electronically and NYSE MKT,
formerly known as NYSE Amex, will be suspended, the exchange
operator said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
