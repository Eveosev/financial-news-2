South Korean manufacturers’
confidence fell for the second straight month as slowing
economic growth weighed on sentiment.  An  index  measuring expectations for November fell to 70
from 72 in October, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement in
Seoul today. A measure of expectations at  non-manufacturing
companies  was unchanged from October at 67, with any number
below 100 indicating that pessimists outnumber optimists.  “The Korean economy still faces considerable difficulty in
the coming months,” Yoon Eun Hye, an economist at Standard
Chartered Plc in Seoul, said before the release. “A rebound is
expected in the first quarter of next year.”  South Korea’s gross domestic product expanded 1.6 percent
in the third quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace since
2009. Earnings gains reported last week by Samsung Electronics
Co., which has annual sales equivalent to 13 percent of the
nation’s GDP, show the prospect for a rebound.  The survey was conducted between Oct. 15 and Oct. 22 with
responses from 1,456 manufacturers and 1,066 non-manufacturers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
