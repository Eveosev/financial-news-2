Gasoline rose for a third day and oil fell to a three-month low as  Hurricane Sandy  threatened U.S. East Coast refineries and closed equity trading. Treasuries and the dollar strengthened amid increased demand for refuge.  Gasoline futures jumped 2.1 percent in New York while oil fell 0.9 percent at 4 p.m. New York time.

The euro depreciated 0.3 percent to $1.2901.  U.S. stock trading was canceled for a second day, joining bond markets, as 85-mile-per-hour winds and surging seas from Hurricane Sandy bore down on New York and paralyzed American capital markets. Some New Jersey refineries shut or reduced operations. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble rejected another debt restructuring for  Greece , while in Spain a slump in retail sales fueled concern about a deepening recession.  “For today the downward pressure from the slowing global economy will move to the background as Sandy and the impact it could have to the most populated portion of the U.S. evolves over the next several days,” Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York, said in a report.  Second Day  The closing of stock trading for a second day was announced by NYSE Euronext after consultations with other exchanges.

Consumer spending in the U.S. rose 0.8 percent in September, more than forecast, after a 0.5 percent gain the prior month, a Commerce Department report showed today.

It reached $1.2883 on Oct. 26, the lowest level since Oct. 11.

Italian Bonds  Italian bonds fell as the government sold 8 billion euros ($10.3 billion) of bills before the outcome of a regional vote in Sicily that may signal the direction of forthcoming national elections. Berlusconi said on Oct. 27 the government’s policies were deepening the recession. The yield on  Italy ’s 10-year bond increased 11 basis points to 5.02 percent.
