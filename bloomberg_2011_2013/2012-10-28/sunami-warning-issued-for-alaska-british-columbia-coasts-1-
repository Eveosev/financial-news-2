sensor and a warning was issued to residents of coastal areas of
Alaska and British Columbia by the Alaska Tsunami Warning
Center.  “Coastal residents in the warning area who are near the
beach or in low-lying regions should move immediately inland to
higher ground,” the center said in a bulletin on its website.  The quake struck near Haida Gwaii, also known as the Queen
 Charlotte  Islands, about 500 miles (800 kilometers) northwest
