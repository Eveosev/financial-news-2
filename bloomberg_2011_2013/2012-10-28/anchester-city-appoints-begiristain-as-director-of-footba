English soccer champion  Manchester
City  appointed Txiki Begiristain as its new director of football
as part of a revamp of the clubâ€™s organization.  The 48-year-old previously had a similar role at Barcelona
and his job at City will see him take responsibility for
supporting manager  Roberto Mancini  in first-team recruitment and
operations, City said  on its website .  Brian Marwood, currently football administrator, will
become managing director of the new City Football Academy when
it opens at the start of the 2013-14 season.  Both men will report directly to Chief Executive Officer
Ferran Soriano, City said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
