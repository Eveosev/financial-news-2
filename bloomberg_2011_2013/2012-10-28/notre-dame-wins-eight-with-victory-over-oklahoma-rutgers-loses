Everett Golson threw for 177 yards
and rushed one yard for a touchdown as the University of  Notre
Dame  tallied its eighth straight college football victory with a
30-13 win over the University of  Oklahoma .  Golson returned to his quarterbacking duties for the team
after sitting out last week’s game with a concussion.  “What we’d been hearing was a lot of people didn’t think
we could win this game,” Golson told reporters. “That kind of
just added that fuel to my fire that was already burning. We
just wanted to come out and show them that we can.”  In other games involving teams that are Bowl Championship
Series-ranked, it was No. 1 Alabama 38, No. 11 Mississippi State
7; No. 10 Georgia 17, No. 2 Florida 9; No. 3 Kansas State 55,
No. 14 Texas Tech 24; No. 4 Oregon 70, Colorado 14;  Arizona  39,
No 9. Southern California 36; and Kent State 35, No. 15 Rutgers
23.  At Oklahoma Memorial Stadium in Norman, Cierre Wood rushed
62 yards for a touchdown and Theo Riddick went 15 yards for a
score, while Kyle Brindza kicked three field goals for the No. 5
Fighting Irish (8-0).  Michael Hunnicutt kicked two field goals for the No. 8
Sooners (5-2) and Blake Bell tied the score at 13-13 on a one-
yard run with nine minutes left in the game.  Landry Jones completed 35 of 51 passing attempts for 356
yards and one interception for Oklahoma, a member of the Big 12
Conference.  Rutgers Upset  At High Point Solutions Stadium in Piscataway,  New Jersey ,
Kent State handed No. 15  Rutgers University  its first loss of
the season in a 35-23 non-conference game.  “We came on the road against a very tough opponent,” Kent
State coach Darrell Hazell told reporters. “We made enough
plays early in the game to keep those guys off balance. Rutgers
kept fighting back, and our guys kept fighting them off.”  Spencer Keith gave Kent State a 7-3 lead in the first
quarter with a one-yard scoring pass to Zack Hitchens after
Rutgers (7-1, 4-0 Big East) had scored on a 42-yard field goal
by Nick Borgese.  Mark Fackler scored on a 25-yard interception and Dri
Archer had a seven-yard touchdown run for Kent State before
Rutgers’ Gary Nova threw a 19-yard scoring pass to Tim Wright
with four seconds left in the half to trail 21-10.  In the second half, Trayion Durham scored on a three-yard
run and Keith connected with Josh Boyle on a 15-yard pass for
Kent State. Nova hit Brandon Coleman for a 24-yard pass and
Jawan Jamison added a touchdown on a two-yard run for Rutgers.  The Scarlet Knights still have a chance to win the  Big
East .  “There’s a goal that is in front of us that’s never been
done at Rutgers, the Big East championship,” coach Kyle Flood
told reporters. “We have an opportunity sitting in conference
play to be able to do that over the last three games of our
season. That will be conference games. I think we’ll be very
motivated, there’s no doubt about that.”  In the final three games of the season, Rutgers will play
Cincinnati (5-2, 1-1), Pittsburgh (4-4, 1-3) and No. 16
Louisville (8-0, 3-0).  To contact the reporter on this story:
