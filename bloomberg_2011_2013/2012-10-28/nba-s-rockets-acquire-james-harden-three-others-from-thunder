The Rockets acquired top National
Basketball Association reserve scorer  James Harden  in a trade
with the Oklahoma City Thunder who got guards Kevin Martin and
Jeremy Lamb, Houston General Manager Daryl Morey said.  In addition to Harden, the Rockets received center Cole Aldrich, guard Daequan Cook and forward Lazar Hayward in the
trade with the Thunder, who also were given three future draft
selections.  “While I never like having to send out quality players
like Kevin Martin and Jeremy Lamb, this trade gives us a chance
to make an immediate impact on the future of our franchise
moving forward,” said Rockets owner Leslie Alexander in a
statement. “James Harden was part of Team USA’s gold medal team
at the London Olympics and is one of the most skilled shooting
guards in the NBA.”  Harden, 23, has averaged 12.7 points, 2.5 assists, 3.4
rebounds and 1.1 steals in 220 regular season games with the
Thunder. In 20 playoff games, he averaged 16.3 points, 5.1
rebounds and 3.4 assists.  During the 2011-12 season, Harden recorded career high
averages for points (16.8), rebounds (4.1) and assists (3.7). On
April 18, Harden scored a career-best 40 points in a 109-97
victory over the  Phoenix Suns . After leading all NBA reserves in
scoring average in 2012, Harden became the youngest recipient of
the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award.  Aldrich has averaged 1.7 points and 1.9 rebounds in 44
regular season games with the Thunder. Cook has played in 279
games, averaging 7.1 points and 2.3 rebounds. Hayward has
averaged 2.9 points and 1.3 rebounds in 68 games since being
selected by the  Washington Wizards  with the 30th pick in the
2010 NBA Draft.  Martin ended his Rockets’ career averaging 21.3 points, 2.5
assists and 3.0 rebounds in 144 games. Lamb, who was drafted by
the Rockets with the 12th overall selection in this summer’s NBA
Draft, led Houston’s NBA Summer League team in scoring,
averaging 20.0 points, 4.4 rebounds and 1.00 steal in five
games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
