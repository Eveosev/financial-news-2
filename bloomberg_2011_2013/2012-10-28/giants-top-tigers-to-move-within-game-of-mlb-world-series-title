The San Francisco Giants defeated
the Detroit Tigers 2-0 to move within one game of winning Major
League Baseball’s World Series title.  The Giants own a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. The
 Boston Red Sox  were the last team to sweep the series in 2007
when they won four straight games over the  Colorado Rockies .  Gregor Blanco hit a run-scoring triple and then scored on
Brandon Crawford’s single to give the Giants a 2-0 lead at
Comerica Park in Detroit.  Ryan Vogelsong allowed five hits and struck out three in 5
2/3 innings for the Giants.  Game 4 is tomorrow night in Detroit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
