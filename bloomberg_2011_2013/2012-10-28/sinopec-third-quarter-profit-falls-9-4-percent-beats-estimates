China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) ,
Asia’s biggest refiner, posted a 9.4 percent decline in third-
quarter profit, beating estimates, as two increases in retail
fuel prices in the period helped margins.  Net Income dropped to 18.3 billion  yuan  ($2.93 billion) or
0.199 yuan a share, from 20.2 billion yuan or 0.226 yuan a share
a year ago, the company, known as Sinopec, said in a statement
to the Shanghai stock exchange today. That compares with a
median estimate of 14.19 billion yuan in a survey of nine
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  China , which controls retail fuel prices to contain
inflation, raised prices twice in August and September after
inflation dropped to 1.9 percent in September from as high as
4.5 percent in January. Sinopec, forced to sell fuel below cost
under the pricing system, posted its lowest half-yearly profit
since 2008 in the six months ended June 30.  “Operations in the third quarter improved thanks to our
active adjustments in production and sales,” the company said
in the statement. “Prices of chemical products also rebounded
in the third quarter after a big decline in the second
quarter.”  Crude production rose 2.3 percent in the first nine months
to 245 million barrels and natural gas output increased 15
percent to 438 billion cubic feet, according to the statement.
Realized crude prices rose 2.5 percent to 100.69 a barrel, while
realized natural gas prices rose 5.5 percent to $5.77 per
thousand cubic feet, it said. Brent crude, the benchmark for
more than half of the world’s oil, averaged $112.20 a barrel in
the first nine months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Capital spending reached 83.4 billion yuan in the first
nine months, with 35 billion yuan going toward exploration and
production, the statement showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
