Syrian forces shelled regions around
the capital, Damascus, on the third day of a United Nations-
brokered cease-fire, as the government and rebels blamed each
other for breaching the truce.  Government forces carried out three air raids around the
cities of Harasta, Arbeen and Zamalka, according to a report by
the opposition  Syrian Observatory for Human Rights . Armed groups
opened fire on army checkpoints in the city of Deir Azzour,
prompting government forces to attack back and kill “a number
of terrorists,” the state-run  Syrian Arab News Agency  said.  At least 120 people were killed yesterday, the U.K.-based
observatory said on its  Facebook  page. Some 150 Syrians were
killed a day earlier, including 58 unarmed civilians, it said.  The agreement to respect the truce negotiated by UN special
envoy Lakhdar Brahimi during Eid al-Adha, the most important
Muslim holiday, is the first time since April that the two sides
said they would stop fighting. Neither upheld the previous
cease-fire, arranged by Brahimi’s predecessor, Kofi Annan,
though the truce slowed the pace of killing for a few days.  At least 35,000 people have been killed since the uprising
against Assad’s government began 19 months ago, according to the
observatory. The UN has registered more than 350,000 Syrians who
have fled from their homeland to escape the conflict that has
spilled over into Lebanon and  Turkey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
