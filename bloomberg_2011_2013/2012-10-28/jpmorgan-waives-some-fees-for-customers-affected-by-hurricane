JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, said it is waiving fees for customers in
seven states and Washington as Hurricane Sandy approaches.  Late fees on credit cards, business and consumer loans,
including mortgages, and auto and student loans will be waived,
the New York-based bank said today in an e-mailed statement. The
policy applies through Oct. 31 for clients in Connecticut,
Delaware, Maryland,  New Jersey , New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia
and the District of Columbia, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
