European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said he sees skepticism about how
quickly funds from the European Stability Mechanism can be
deployed when needed because of cumbersome decision-making.  Borrowing costs for euro-area governments have dropped in
recent weeks based on the assumption that the ESM, the euro-
area’s bailout fund, will function as advertised, Nowotny said
in an interview with Austrian state television broadcaster  ORF 
today. It may be useful to test the ESM’s ability to act quickly
in practice, he said.  “The money is now available, but it’s never been used,”
Nowotny said in the interview. “The international  capital
markets  are watching very closely if the funds can actually be
deployed in a quick and efficient fashion.”  Euro-area countries established the bailout fund as a
backstop to the debt crisis roiling the region. The ESM, which
takes over from the temporary European Financial Stability
Facility, was declared operational on Oct. 8 and will rely on
paid-in capital by European governments to underpin its full
firepower of 500 billion euros ($647 billion). By 2014,
governments will have paid in 80 billion euros in capital.  “The tranches will be paid in, the cannon is going to be
loaded in time,” Nowotny said. “The question is, can it fire
when it’s needed? There are so many and such difficult decision
mechanisms involved that there is a certain amount of
skepticism.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
