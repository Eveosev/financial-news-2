A 54-year-old bottle of Bowmore
whisky failed to sell at auction for the second time this month
after no bidder was willing to meet the minimum price.  The Bowmore 1957, the oldest whisky released by the
distiller from western  Scotland , went on sale in New York today
and had an estimate of $160,000 to $190,000. Like at an auction
in Edinburgh on Oct. 10, the hammer came down short of the
reserve, according to Bonhams, the organizer of the sale.  The whisky comes in a hand-blown platinum encrusted
decanter. The net proceeds from the sales were to go to five
Scottish charities, Bowmore said last month.  A bottle of 55-year-old Glenfiddich malt whisky produced to
honor the oldest living Scot sold at auction on Dec. 14 in
Edinburgh for a record 46,850 pounds ($75,377). The whisky,
which was put into casks in 1955, had a guide price of between
30,000 and 35,000 pounds and all the proceeds were donated to
Water Aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
