  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  expects to
be open for business tomorrow when Hurricane Sandy strikes New
York as the firm gets help from overseas offices and people
working from home.  Plans include using “teams in London and other locations
around the world for additional support, having designated
people work from our Greenwich and Princeton sites and, for most
of you, working from home,” according to a staff memo from
Chief Administrative Officer Jeffrey Schroeder that was obtained
today by Bloomberg News.  Some individuals deemed critical to operations will be told
to come to work if they can get to their offices and return
safely, according to the memo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
