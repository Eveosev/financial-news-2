Crude fell for the first time in
three days in  New York  while gasoline rose as refineries curbed
operations before Hurricane Sandy strikes the U.S. East Coast.  West Texas Intermediate futures slid as much as 1.1
percent, while prices of the motor fuel advanced as much as 1.9
percent. Sandy will probably make landfall tomorrow, according
to a National Hurricane Center  advisory . Phillips 66,  NuStar (NS) 
Energy LP and  Hess Corp. (HES)  said they are shutting or reducing
output at  New Jersey  refineries as a precaution against the
storm that may become the worst to hit the region in 100 years.  “The crude supply situation has improved, and high
inventories are capping prices,” said Michael Poulsen, an
analyst at Global Risk Management in Middelfart,  Denmark , who
predicts that Brent will trade from $105 to $110 a barrel next
month. “But we should watch out for Super-Storm Sandy, as
refineries are being shut while the storm rages.”  WTI for December delivery dropped as much as 94 cents to
$85.34 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $85.96 at 12:59 p.m.  London  time. Prices are
down 13 percent this year.  Brent for December settlement advanced 52 cents to $110.07
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. The
front-month European benchmark grade’s premium over the WTI
contract was at $24.05.  Frankenstorm Looms  Sandy’s maximum sustained winds increased to 85 mph, up
from 75 mph earlier, the hurricane center said in an  advisory  at
5 a.m. New York time. It was centered about 285 miles east of
Cape Hatteras,  North Carolina , and about 385 miles south-
southeast of  New York City , moving north at 15 mph. Sandy is
forecast to converge with two other systems, creating a
phenomenon the  National Weather Service  dubbed Frankenstorm.  “The primary consideration would be disruption to refinery
infrastructure,” said Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at
CMC Markets in Sydney. “That has the potential to disrupt
markets and cause local and regional product shortages.”  Combined trading volumes for all of the monthly WTI
contracts on the Nymex were at 55,037 contracts at 12:52 p.m.
London time, compared with this year’s full-day average of
576,686, according to Bloomberg calculations using data from the
exchange.  New York, New Jersey and Delaware Bay ports were closed to
vessel traffic by the U.S. Coast Guard, halting oil tanker
deliveries that may affect the region’s plants. There are seven
refineries in the area with a combined capacity of about 1.29
million barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Refineries Shut  Phillips (PSX)  is in the process of shutting its 238,000 barrel-
a-day Bayway refinery and expects the plant to be fully idled by
early today. Hess said yesterday it would begin cutting rates at
its 70,000 barrel-a-day Port Reading plant at 6 p.m. local time,
while NuStar said Oct. 27 that its 74,000 barrel-a-day Paulsboro
asphalt refinery would be shut by early today.  Gasoline in New York was up 3.22 cents at $2.7313 a gallon
after rising as much as 5.09 cents to $2.75. Prices settled at
$2.6991 a gallon on Oct. 26, the highest in more than a week.  The New York Mercantile Exchange will close floor trading
today because of Sandy, CME Group Inc., its owner, said in an e-
mailed statement. Electronic trading of energy and other Nymex
products will be unaffected.  Hedge funds  reduced  bets  on rising oil prices for the
fourth time in five weeks, cutting net-long positions by 17
percent in the seven days ended Oct. 23, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders report on Oct. 26
showed. It was the least since the week ended July 31.  Hedge Funds  In London, hedge funds and other money managers reduced
bullish bets on  Brent crude  by the most since June in the week
ended Oct. 23, according to data from ICE Futures Europe.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 94,007 lots,
the London-based exchange said today in its weekly Commitment of
Traders report. That’s down by 25,569 contracts, or 21 percent,
from 119,576 last week, the biggest cut since June 5 and the
lowest level since August.  Oil in New York has technical support along its lower
Bollinger Band, around $85.83 a barrel today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Futures on Oct. 26 traded below this
indicator before settling above it. Buy orders tend to be
clustered near chart-support levels.  Brent in London will trade in a range of $105 to $110 a
barrel in the three months ended Dec. 31, according to a
forecast by Morgan Stanley. Recent price declines are related to
macro-economic concerns and not fundamental changes in the
market,  Hussein Allidina , the bank’s New York-based head of
commodities research, said in a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
