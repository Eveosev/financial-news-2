Five years after global equities
peaked, valuations in  developing countries  have tumbled the most
even as their economies expanded fastest.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the MSCI Emerging Market Index’s
price-to-book ratio has dropped 47 percent since October 2007,
compared with declines of 41 percent for  Japan ’s Nikkei 225
Stock Average, 38 percent for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index and 27
percent in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The lower panel
shows economic output has increased most in developing nations,
according to the  International Monetary Fund .  The decline in valuations has lured  Jack Ablin , the chief
investment officer of BMO Private Bank, who said emerging-market
stocks were too expensive a month before the MSCI gauge peaked
on Oct. 29, 2007. The Chicago-based investor now advises holding
more of the shares than are represented in benchmark indexes.  “We are overweight,” Ablin, who started boosting
emerging-equity holdings in January, wrote in an Oct. 26 e-mail
to  Bloomberg News . “We shifted out of commodities and into
emerging stocks as a cheaper way to play emerging economies.”  The S&P GSCI Spot Index of commodity prices has climbed 6.6
percent since October 2007. Gross domestic product in dollar
terms has increased 71 percent in emerging countries, 37 percent
in Japan as the yen strengthened and 12 percent in the U.S.
Europe’s output fell 2.5 percent.  The developing-market  index  trades at 1.6 times book value
-- or assets minus liabilities -- down from 3 times at its peak,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge, which was
valued at a 2 percent premium to the S&P 500 five years ago, now
trades at a 27 percent discount, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
