Raw-sugar futures that dropped from
a 30-year high last month may rise as much as 16 percent in the
next three weeks, according to a technical analysis by Paul Kavanaugh, a senior analyst and broker at PFGBest.  This month’s slide from a high of 34.77 cents a pound on
Dec. 29 has created “buying opportunities,” based on chart
patterns, Kavanaugh said. The attached chart shows sugar traded
on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  climbed to a 30-year high after
declining as much as 24 percent between Nov. 11 and Nov. 17.  “I see a similar trend forming after the price decline
since the end of December,” Kavanaugh said by telephone from  Chicago . The commodity may reach 36 cents by Feb. 14, he said.  Raw sugar for March delivery closed yesterday at 31.12
cents, down 10 percent from last month’s peak, which was the
highest since 1980. Prices gained 19 percent last year, after
more than doubling the year before. Global supplies have been
threatened by adverse weather in Brazil, the biggest producer,
as well as in  China  and  Russia .  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
