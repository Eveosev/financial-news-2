Plus Markets Group Plc (PMK) , holder of one
of the five U.K. exchange licenses, rejected a takeover bid by
Gulf Merchant Bank Ltd., backing a previously agreed offer from
 ICAP Plc (IAP)  for its stock-exchange unit.  “The terms put forward by Gulf Merchant are such that the
Gulf Merchant proposal is materially less attractive in terms of
net financial benefit to the group’s shareholders,” Plus said
in a statement today. “Although the headline consideration from
Gulf Merchant appears greater than that offered by ICAP.”  Plus, scheduled to close after running out of money and
failing to agree terms with any buyer, in May agreed that ICAP,
the world’s largest broker of transactions between banks, will
pay 1 pound ($1.53) to buy its stock exchange unit. Yesterday,
Gulf Merchant said it approached Plus Market with a revised
offer “substantially in excess” of ICAP’s. The company didn’t
reveal the terms of its offer.  Set up by former London Stock Exchange Plc executives, Plus
sought to compete with LSE, and was granted exchange status in
2007. Still, it was unable to attract sufficient listings to be
profitable or draw trading away from LSE, unlike other new
entrants such as Bats Global Markets and Chi-X Europe Ltd.  Plus was being wound down over the next six months after
failing to find a buyer. Companies listed on the exchange’s
markets were told they needed to find an alternative venue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
