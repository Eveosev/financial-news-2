Japanese  stocks  fell, sending the
Topix Index to its longest weekly losing streak since September
1975, after  China ’s manufacturing and U.S. economic data missed
estimates, adding to concern the world’s two largest economies
are slowing.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which gets 26 percent of its sales in China and
the U.S., dropped 3.5 percent.  Hitachi Construction Machinery
Co. (6305) , a maker of heavy equipment, slid 4.2 percent after mining
machinery bellwether  Joy Global  Inc. cut revenue forecasts.
Aozora Bank Ltd. dropped 5.4 percent after saying plans to repay
public funds won’t be disclosed at its June shareholder meeting.  The Topix slipped 1.5 percent to 708.93 as of the 3 p.m.
trading close in Tokyo, capping a ninth week of decline that
left it 1.8 percent lower for the five trading days. The  Nikkei
225 Stock Average (NKY)  dropped 1.2 percent to 8,440.25. About five
stocks fell for each that rose. The benchmark dropped 10.3
percent in May, the steepest monthly decline since May 2010.  “The global economy, centered in the U.S. and China, is
facing stronger headwinds than expected, and recovery
expectations are tapering off a bit,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a
Tokyo-based senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management
Co., which oversees the equivalent of $70 billion. “Japan’s
economy doesn’t have the kind of domestic demand that you need
to spur growth, so it’s more vulnerable to overseas economies.”  Debt Crisis  The Topix  has fallen  19 percent from this year’s high on
March 27 as voter opposition to austerity measures in Europe
raised concern the debt crisis is worsening, and as China’s
growth slowed. The gauge is nearing a 20 percent drop from this
year’s peak, which to investors signals the beginning of a  bear
market . The declines have cut the value of shares on the Topix
to 0.84 times book value, the lowest since October 2008.  Stocks fell as China’s purchasing managers’ index slid to
50.4 from 53.3 in April, the statistics bureau and logistics
federation said today. The weakest reading since December
compares with the 52.0 median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 27 economists. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.
A separate gauge from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
showed a seventh straight contraction.  Companies that do business in China fell. Murata
Manufacturing Co., which gets 48 percent of its revenue in China
and Taiwan, lost 2.8 percent to 3,955 yen. Trading company  Emori
& Co. (9963) , which depends on China for 41 percent of its sales,
dropped 1.3 percent to 913 yen.  U.S. Jobs Data  A U.S. Labor Department report due today is projected to
show nonfarm payrolls increased by 150,000 workers in May while
the  unemployment rate  held at 8.1 percent.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.4 percent
today. The index fell 0.2 percent in New York yesterday, when
data showed the  U.S. economy  grew more slowly in the first
quarter than previously estimated and business activity expanded
in May at the slowest pace since September 2009.  The U.S. payroll report “is going to be important
obviously on the day, but the big issue is how Europe is going
to play out,” said  Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief investment
strategist for the Asia-Pacific region at Russell Investment
Group, which manages about $150 billion. “Spanish bond yields
are about 6.5 percent and that tells you something that can’t be
ignored. While Spanish yields are that high, you have to have a
fairly cautious attitude toward adding risk to your portfolio
right now.”  No Spain Bailout  The  International Monetary Fund  said it’s not preparing
financial aid for  Spain , and the country denied it’s in talks
about a bailout. The nation’s 10-year debt yields were at 6.56
percent, near the 7 percent level that prompted bailouts in
Greece, Ireland and Portugal.  Japanese exporters also fell after the yen touched its
highest level against the euro since December 2000. A strong
currency erodes the value of overseas revenue when companies
repatriate earnings.  Sony, the nation’s largest exporter of consumer electronics,
declined 3.5 percent to 1,013 yen, and  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s
second-biggest automaker by market value, fell 2.1 percent to
2,459 yen.  Machinery Makers Fall  Machinery makers fell after Joy Global, the maker of P&H
and Joy mining equipment, cut forecasts for full-year earnings
and revenue as mining companies ease capital expenditure amid
concern over the slowdown in China. Hitachi Construction slid
4.2 percent to 1,449 yen.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , Japan’s largest
construction machinery maker, lost 4.3 percent to 1,798 yen.  Aozora Bank, the Japanese lender controlled by Cerberus
Capital Management LP, fell 5.4 percent to 157 yen after saying
it won’t announce proposals for repayment of public funds at its
June shareholders meeting.  Among stocks that rose, Janome Sewing Machine Co. jumped 17
percent to 62 yen. Operating profit is poised to more than
double this fiscal year, the Nikkei newspaper reported.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 5.5 percent to 27.65,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.9 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
