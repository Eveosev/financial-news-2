Macau  casino  gambling revenue rose
7.3 percent in May, the slowest pace since July 2009, matching
analysts’ estimates.  Gambling revenue for the six casino operators in the former
Portuguese colony rose last month to 26.1 billion patacas ($3.3
billion), the second highest level on record, from 24.3 billion
patacas a year earlier, according to the Chinese city’s  Gaming
Inspection and Coordination Bureau . The median estimate of five
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was for 7 percent growth.  “Despite the slow growth, May 2012 is actually the second
best month on record, only behind 26.8 billion patacas in
October 2011,” Aaron Fischer, an analyst at CLSA Ltd., wrote in
an e-mail yesterday. “We expect gaming revenue growth to
recover in June with a lower” comparable base of 20.8 billion
patacas.  Macau last year posted a 43 percent increase in gambling
revenue for May, when  China ’s Labor Day holidays started on a
Sunday. The so-called “Golden Week” holidays began on a
Tuesday this year.  The revenue result “is a denominator problem more than an
overall numerator deceleration,” Jon Oh, a New York-based
analyst for CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, wrote May 31 in a note to
clients, in which he forecast growth would be the slowest in
three years.  Casino companies operating in Macau declined in  Hong Kong 
trading.  MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282)  slumped 6.2 percent to
HK$11.72, the lowest close since Feb. 6, and  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) 
fell 4.1 percent to HK$13.22.  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) 
slid 4.3 percent,  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883)  dropped 5.2
percent and  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  retreated 0.8 percent.  In U.S. trading, Melco Crown dropped 4.5 percent to $11.225
