The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities dropped 1.1 percent to 589.80 at 4:58 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
fell 0.9 percent to 1,425.613.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded near the lowest close in seven months, heading
for its longest weekly losing streak in five and a half years,
after a Chinese manufacturing index missed estimates, adding to
speculation demand will falter.  Oil for July delivery fell as much as 63 cents to $85.90 a
barrel and was at $86.40 in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 2:36 p.m. Singapore time. The contract
yesterday slid 1.5 percent to $86.53, the lowest close since
Oct. 20. Prices are 13 percent lower this year and down 4.9
percent this week for a fifth weekly drop, the longest losing
streak since January 2007.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures dropped after a government report
showed that production increased in March by 5 percent from last
year, increasing concern that U.S. inventories will remain above
the five-year average.  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude rose 94 cents to $15.74 a barrel at 12:15 p.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
This crack spread, a measure of processing profit, gained by the
largest percentage since Nov. 11 and is set for the first weekly
gain in five. Gasoil swaps for July fell $1.18, or 1 percent, to
$114.17 a barrel, PVM said. Prices are headed for a fifth weekly
drop.  Naphtha swaps for July were at $827.75 a metric ton,
according to PVM. The petrochemical and gasoline feedstock is
poised for a 13th weekly decline.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
climbed $8.18 to $61.69 a ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The difference, also known as the crack spread, has
widened 26 percent from last week.  High-sulfur  fuel oil  was at a discount of 95 cents a barrel
to Dubai crude, PVM data showed. The gap is set to widen for the
first week in three, signaling increased losses for refiners
turning crude into residual products.  Fuel oil swaps for July lost $12.75, or 2 percent, to $619
a ton, PVM said. Prices are poised for the fourth weekly
decrease in five.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold is seen declining for a second day and extending a
fourth monthly loss in London on speculation a stronger dollar
will curb demand for the metal as an alternative asset.  Bullion
for immediate delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,557.82 an ounce by
9:12 a.m. in  London . Prices dropped 6.3 percent in May for a
fourth monthly decline, the longest losing run since 1999.
August-delivery futures were 0.3 percent lower at $1,558.80 on
the Comex in  New York .  BASE METALS  Copper climbed for the first time in four days on
speculation that  China  will do more to boost growth after a
manufacturing gauge in the biggest consumer of the metal missed
estimates. Nickel, zinc and aluminum also rose.  Copper for delivery in three months increased 0.7 percent
to $7,473.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 2:28
p.m. Seoul time. The price slumped 12 percent in May, erasing
this year’s gains. The July-delivery contract advanced 0.3
percent to $3.3745 a pound on the Comex.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn gained for the first time in six days, paring a second
weekly decline, on speculation that above-normal temperatures
may hurt crop in the U.S., the world’s largest producer and
exporter.  Corn for July delivery gained as much as 1 percent to
$5.6075 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $5.59
at 2:13 p.m. Singapore time. Prices are poised to drop 3.4
percent this week.  Soybeans for July delivery were little
changed at $13.3925 a bushel, set for a 3.1 percent loss this
week. July-delivery wheat was also little changed at $6.4325 a
bushel. Futures are headed for a 5.4 percent decline this week.  Rubber declined to the lowest level in more than six months
as a report showed manufacturing in China slowed last month,
raising concern that demand will weaken.  The November-delivery contract lost 2.7 percent to end at
255.3 yen a kilogram ($3,252 a metric ton), the lowest
settlement level for the most-active contract since Nov. 10, on
the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Futures fell 4.4 percent this
week, declining for a fourth week and wiping out gains this
year.  Palm oil  dropped for a third day, extending the biggest
monthly loss in more than two years, on speculation that demand
for commodities may decline after China’s manufacturing index
missed estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
