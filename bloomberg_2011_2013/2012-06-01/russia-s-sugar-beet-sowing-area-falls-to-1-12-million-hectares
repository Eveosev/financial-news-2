Russia planted 1.12 million hectares
(2.8 million acres) of sugar-beets for 2012, down from 1.29
million hectares a year earlier, the Sugar Producers’ Union
 said .  Sugar-beet development in the Central, Volga and Southern
federal districts was helped by rain in the last 10 days of May,
the union said today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
