U.S. homebuilders had their biggest
decline in almost 10 months after the Labor Department reported
job gains that missed analysts’ estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s 1500 Homebuilding  Index (S15HOME)  dropped 7.8
percent today in  New York  trading, led by  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) , the
nation’s largest builder by revenue, which fell 12 percent to
$8.26. PulteGroup and the 11-member index last had a larger one-
day decline on Aug. 8.  U.S. employers added 69,000 jobs in May, the fewest in a
year, and the  unemployment  rate rose to 8.2 percent from 8.1
percent, according to Labor Department data released today. The
gain was smaller than the most pessimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey. Shares of U.S. homebuilders had been
helped this year by improved orders and sales as the jobless
rate fell,  consumer confidence  grew and record-low mortgage
rates made homes more affordable.  The jobs report “was a step backward for housing in every
way,” Jed Kolko, chief economist at Trulia Inc., a San
Francisco-based home-sales information service, said today in an
e-mail. “Construction employment fell, job growth was
especially slow in hard-hit housing markets, and the job picture
slipped for 25-to-34-year-olds.”  Employment in construction fell by 28,000 jobs, according
to the Labor Department.  Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) , the largest U.S. luxury-home builder,
had a profit of 10 cents a share, compared with a loss of 12
cents a year earlier, for its second quarter, and orders for new
homes rose 47 percent from a year earlier, the Horsham,
Pennsylvania-based company reported May 23. Its shares fell 7.5
percent today to $25.24, the biggest one-day decline since Dec.
