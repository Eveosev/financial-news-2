The euro extended declines against
the dollar and yen after a report showed unemployment in the
common-currency area reached the highest on record.  The 17-member currency slid 0.4 percent to $1.2316 at 10:09
a.m. London time and 0.6 percent to 96.28 yen.  The jobless rate in the euro region was at 11 percent in
April and March, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said today. That’s the highest since the data series
started in 1995.  To contact the reporter on this story:
