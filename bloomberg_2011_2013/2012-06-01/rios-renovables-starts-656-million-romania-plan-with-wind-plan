Rios Renovables SL , a Spanish
renewable-energy developer, will erect three  Vestas Wind Systems
A/S (VWS)  turbines on  Romania ’s Black Sea coast, kicking off a 532
million-euro ($656 million) investment plan in the country.  Rios Renovables will begin work on the 12 million-euro, 9-
megawatt wind project at Tulcea near the mouth of the River
Danube at the end of this month, the company said in a
statement. It will then start building a 10-megawatt solar plant
in the country in July.  Spain’s clean-energy developers are looking abroad to
expand after Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s government halted
subsidies for new renewable-power projects in January. Romania
has also attracted Spanish utility  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  with an
incentive plan for wind-farm investments.  Rios Renovables’ proposed solar plant, at Lovrin near
Timisoara, will eventually produce 60 megawatts, the Pamplona-
based company said in the statement. It plans to build a total
of 140 megawatts of solar in Romania by 2014 at a cost of 400
million euros, and 120 megawatts of wind for 132 million euros.  The company intends to get funding from lenders including
Barcelona-based CaixaBank, which has an office in Bucharest, and
guarantees from the Romanian  state bank  and the regional
government of Navarre, where Rios Renovables has its
headquarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
