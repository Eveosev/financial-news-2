Crude-oil shipments aboard
supertankers bound for  China  fell 13 percent this week,
according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tankers with a total carrying capacity of about 15.8
million deadweight tons are heading for the Asian nation, down
from 18.1 million tons last week. About 12 percent of the fleet
of the largest  oil tankers  signaling future destinations is
bound for China, the world’s biggest energy consumer. The ships
would haul about 115.6 million barrels of oil, assuming a
conversion factor of 7.33 barrels a ton.  The following table shows the destinations and combined
carrying capacity in deadweight tons of 418 very large crude
carriers, out of a global fleet of 559, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Average drafts are expressed as a
percentage of maximum sailing depth and are an indication of
cargo size. Each country’s percentage share of total oil
shipments is shown for the current and previous weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
