Thailand ’s baht had a fifth weekly
decline and government bonds rose on concern growth in  Southeast
Asia ’s second-biggest economy is slowing.  The local currency dropped to the weakest level in almost
two years yesterday as a central bank report showed exports
shrank for the sixth time in seven months in April.
Manufacturing in  China , the biggest buyer of Thailand’s exports,
rose less than economists forecast in May, according to
government data released today.  “The baht depreciated in line with regional currencies
amid risk-off sentiment from Europe’s debt problems,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a Bangkok-based trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp. “There is concern about the export outlook with some
slowdown not only in  Europe  but also in China.”  The baht, little changed today, slumped 0.5 percent this
week to 31.85 per dollar as of 3:20 p.m. in Bangkok, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 31.96
yesterday, the lowest level since August 2010, and Hasegawa
predicts it will trade between 31.75 and 32.00 next week.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was steady this week and today at
4.52 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 dropped nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to
3.52 percent from a week ago and three basis points from
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
