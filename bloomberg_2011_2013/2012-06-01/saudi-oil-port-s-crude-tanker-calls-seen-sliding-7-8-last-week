The carrying capacity of  oil tankers 
calling at  Saudi Arabia ’s  Ras Tanura , the world’s largest crude-
export complex, slid 7.8 percent in the week to May 26, signals
from the vessels showed.  Ships with a capacity of 8.03 million deadweight tons, or
8.41 million barrels a day, arrived during the period, compared
with 8.71 million tons in the prior week, according to vessel-
tracking data from  IHS Inc. (IHS)  compiled by Bloomberg.  Some vessels call at other loading ports before or after
Ras Tanura, indicating they may have collected partial cargoes
elsewhere. The Ras Tanura complex, including Ras al-Ju’aymah, is
the largest global crude terminal, according to the website of
Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as  Saudi Aramco .  The first table below lists the destination countries of
tankers calling at Ras Tanura in the latest week as of about 10
a.m. London time today. The second table shows the deadweight
tonnage and carrying capacity in barrels of tankers that called
