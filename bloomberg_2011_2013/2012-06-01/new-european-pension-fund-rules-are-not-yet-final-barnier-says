Michel Barnier , the European Union
commissioner for financial services, said new pension-fund rules
are “not yet spelled out” and expects to submit a revised
directive on institutions for occupational retirement provision
before the summer of 2013 rather than at the end of this year.  The European Commission, the EU executive in Brussels,
wants to await quantitative impact assessments, Barnier said in
the text of a speech in Amsterdam today.  The commissioner also said Solvency II rules for insurers
should apply starting in January 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
