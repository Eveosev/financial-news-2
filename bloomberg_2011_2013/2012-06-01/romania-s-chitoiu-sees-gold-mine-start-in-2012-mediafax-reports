Romania ’s Economy Minister Daniel Chitoiu said he is convinced that  Gabriel Resources Ltd. (GBU) ’s
stalled Rosia Montana gold-mine project will start this year,
Mediafax reported today.  Chitoiu told reporters during a visit to the Romanian town
of Alba Iulia that a political decision on the project might be
taken by the end of this year, according to the Bucharest-based
news service. Mining will continue throughout Romania in an
efficient manner, without causing losses to the state,  Mediafax 
cited Chitoiu as saying.  Chitoiu added that he will take a decision on the mine
together with Environment Minister Rovana Plumb, whose ministry
decides whether  Canada ’s Gabriel Resources gets an environmental
permit to start work at the mine, the news service said.  The Economy Ministry’s press office couldn’t immediately
confirm Chitoiu’s statement when contacted by Bloomberg News by
phone and e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
