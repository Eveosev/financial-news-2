Peruvian consumer prices rose in May
at the slowest pace in four months after food and fuel costs
fell, the government said.  Inflation eased to 0.04 percent from 0.53 percent in April
while the annual rate was 4.14 percent, the national statistics
agency said. The median  estimate  of analysts in a Bloomberg
survey was for increases of 0.13 percent and 4.23 percent
respectively.  The nation’s central bank increased  reserve requirements 
from May 1 to prevent bank lending from fueling demand pressures
as growth rose. Policy makers are ready to tighten monetary
policy further if they see demand stoking inflation that’s been
above target since July, central bank President Julio Velarde
said May 22.  “So far inflation pressures have been coming from supply
shocks and not from the demand side,”  Mario Guerrero , an
economist at Scotiabank Peru, said by phone from Lima. “The
outlook is for inflation to return to the target range next
year. The bank can keep rates on hold.”  Scotiabank projects 3.3 percent inflation this year. The
 finance ministry  said in a report yesterday inflation will slow
to 2.8 percent while gross domestic product will rise 6 percent,
up from a March 9 forecast of 5.7 percent.  The government’s consumer-price index is based on a survey
by the statistics agency of establishments in the  Lima 
Metropolitan area. Food and drink products constitute 38 percent
of the index.  Food and drink prices declined 0.04 percent last month,
electricity prices fell 0.2 percent and gasoline retreated 0.7
percent, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
