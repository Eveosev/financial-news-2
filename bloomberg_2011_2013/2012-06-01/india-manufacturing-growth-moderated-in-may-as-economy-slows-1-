Indian manufacturing growth slowed in
May, a private survey showed, adding to signs of weakening
demand after economic expansion moderated to a nine-year low.  The purchasing managers’ index was at 54.8 in May from 54.9
in April, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said in an e-
mailed statement today. A number above 50 indicates growth.  India faces challenges from accelerating inflation, a
record trade deficit and the impact on Asian exports of the
protracted debt crisis in  Europe . A similar manufacturing gauge
for  China  signaled a contraction for a seventh straight month,
the longest such stretch since the global financial crisis,
another report showed today.  “The outlook for growth in the short term is very bad,”
Tirthankar Patnaik, a Mumbai-based strategist at Religare
Capital Markets Ltd., said before the report. “Industrial
growth is slowing down and investments are not taking place.”  The rupee, which touched a record low yesterday,
strengthened 0.4 percent to 55.8975 per dollar as of 3:44 p.m.
local time. The currency has declined about 20 percent in the
past 12 months. The BSE India Sensitive Index of stocks fell 1.6
percent. The yield on the 8.79 percent note due November 2021
declined two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.36
percent.  India ’s  gross domestic product  increased 5.3 percent last
quarter from a year earlier, the least since 2003, the
government said yesterday. Inflation accelerated to 7.23 percent
in April, the fastest pace among the largest emerging economies.  Rupee Concern  The government expects that the steps it is taking to
bolster economic growth will improve  market sentiment , Finance
Secretary R.S. Gujral told reporters after a briefing in New
Delhi today. He didn’t specify the measures.  The decline in the rupee is a concern, Commerce Minister
 Anand Sharma  said at the briefing. He added India’s goals are to
increase exports by 20 percent this fiscal year and to achieve
$500 billion of overseas sales by 2014.  The  Reserve Bank  of India lowered its benchmark  repurchase
rate  to 8 percent from 8.5 percent on April 17, the first cut
since 2009, after increasing it by a record 3.75 percentage
points from mid-March 2010 to October last year to try and
contain jumps in the cost of living.  It has signaled  government spending , the rupee’s slide and
energy costs may curb scope for more rate cuts. The central bank
also forecasts the economy will recover in the fiscal year
through March 2013, posting growth of 7.3 percent.  The purchasing managers’ index for China from HSBC and
Markit was at 48.4 in May. A PMI from China’s statistics bureau
and logistics federation fell to 50.4 in May from 53.3 in April,
the weakest pace since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
