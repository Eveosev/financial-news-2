Nigeria ’s naira declined, reversing
earlier gains, as oil companies were said to sell fewer dollars
in the market than expected.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer depreciated
0.5 percent to 160.585 per dollar as of 5 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, giving it a weekly decline of 0.3 percent.  “Expectations of dollar sales today by oil companies, as
part of their month-end supply did not materialize, thereby
causing a fall in naira,” Sewa Wusu, currency analyst at Lagos-
based Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone today. “Only one or
two oil companies sold dollars this week.”  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  offers dollars at auctions on
Mondays and Wednesdays and through interbank trading to maintain
exchange-rate stability. The oil industry is the second major
source of dollar supplies in the country. The central bank sold
$500 million at its auctions this week, the highest since Feb.
15, according to data on its website.  “The central bank supply alone couldn’t meet dollar demand
after some foreigners exited the market spurred by the euro zone
crisis,” Wusu said.  Ghana ’s cedi gained less than 0.1 percent to 1.8927 per
dollar, in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
