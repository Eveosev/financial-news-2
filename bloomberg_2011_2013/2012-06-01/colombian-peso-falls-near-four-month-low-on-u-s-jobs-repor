Colombia’s peso fell toward a four-
month low after data showing U.S. payrolls missed forecasts and
factory output slowed in  China  damped demand for higher-yielding
assets.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 1,830.63 per  U.S. dollar . It
touched 1,853.95 on May 23, the weakest level since Jan. 11. The
currency plunged 3.6 percent last month and rose 0.1 percent
this week.  “Data in the U.S. and China is further fueling the
negative mood in global markets,” said William Florez, an
analyst at  Helm Bank SA (PFBHELMB) ’s brokerage unit in Bogota.  Colombia’s short- and medium-term bonds are gaining as
investors seek refuge in shorter maturities amid the concern,
Florez said.  The yield on Colombia’s 9.25 percent peso-denominated debt
due May 2014 dropped 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point,
this week to 5.82 percent, according to the central bank. The
yield on bonds due 2024 fell three basis points to 7.13 percent.  U.S. Labor Department figures showed today that payrolls
climbed by 69,000 last month, less than the most-pessimistic
forecast of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, after a revised
77,000 gain in April, adding further evidence that the labor-
market recovery is stalling. Separately, China’s  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index dropped to 50.4 from 53.3, the weakest
production growth since December.  World stock markets lost more than $4 trillion last month
amid concern  Greece  will exit the euro and Spain’s finances will
deteriorate further. Earlier today, data showed that a gauge of
manufacturing in the 17-nation euro zone fell to a three-year
low of 45.1 in May, indicating a 10th month of contraction,
while unemployment reached 11 percent, the highest on record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
