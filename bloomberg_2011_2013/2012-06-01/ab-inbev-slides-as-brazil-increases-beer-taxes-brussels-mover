Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , the world’s
biggest brewer, posted the second-biggest decline among leading
Belgian stocks after the Brazilian government raised beer taxes
more than anticipated.  The  shares  fell as much as 3.3 percent and were down 3
percent at 53.09 euros as of 12:42 p.m. They had risen 16
percent this year before today.  AB InBev, based in Leuven, Brussels, owns Cia. de Bebidas
das Americas,  Brazil ’s biggest brewer, or AmBev, and gets about
30 percent of its earnings before interest and taxation from the
country, where it sells beers including Skol and Brahma.  The Brazilian government raised taxes on beer by 26 percent
yesterday. A price increase of about 2.9 percent may be needed
to offset the measure, Gabriel Vaz de Lima, an analyst at
 Barclays Capital  in Sao Paolo, wrote in a note yesterday.  Raising prices on that scale would have “a meaningful
impact,” Vaz de Lima wrote. “We expect AmBev to shortly
announce if it’ll offset the tax hike with price increases.”  Tax increases in large markets have depressed beer sales in
many parts of the world. Carlsberg A/S reported a decline in
profit last year after the Russian beer market contracted about
3 percent due to tax increases. Brazil also increased taxes on
soft drinks and cut levies on cars and  consumer credit .  To contact the reporter on this story:
