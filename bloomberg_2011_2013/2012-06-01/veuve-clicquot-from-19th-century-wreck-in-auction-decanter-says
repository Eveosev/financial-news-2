     June 1 (Bloomberg) -  Veuve Clicquot  Champagne from a
schooner wrecked between 1825 and 1830 on an archipelago between
Finland and Sweden will be auctioned next week, Decanter
magazine said.  Four bottles of Veuve Clicquot, six bottles from the
now-defunct Champagne producer Juglar and one Heidsieck & Co.
bottle will be auctioned at Mariehamn, Finland on June 8, it
said, adding that the wines were for historical interest, not
pleasure.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter responsible for this story: Guy Collins
