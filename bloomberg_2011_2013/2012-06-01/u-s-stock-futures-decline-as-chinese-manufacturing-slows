U.S. stocks fell the most since
November, erasing the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s 2012
advance, as American employers added the fewest workers in a
year and reports signaled global manufacturing was slowing.  All  10 groups  in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated
as the gauge extended a drop from its April high to 9.9 percent.
The KBW Bank Index slumped 4.9 percent.  Bank of America Corp. ,
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Boeing Co. (BA)  sank at least 2.9 percent. A measure
of  homebuilders  in S&P indexes tumbled 7.8 percent. Newmont
Mining Corp. rallied 6.7 percent as gold climbed the most since
August on bets for measures to stimulate the  U.S. economy .  The  S&P 500  retreated 2.5 percent to 1,278.04 at 4 p.m. New
York time. The benchmark measure fell below its average price of
the past  200 days . The Dow slid 274.88 points, or 2.2 percent,
to 12,118.57. About 8.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S.
exchanges, or 24 percent above the three-month average.  “The weak jobs report confirms that the U.S. is vulnerable
to a European situation that is going from bad to worse,” said
Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive officer of Pacific
Investment Management Co., the world’s largest manager of bond
funds. “The report’s details speak to an unemployment crisis
that is getting more stubbornly embedded in the structure of the
economy. Looking forward, the employment situation will be
further challenged by an ongoing synchronized global slowing.”  Equities tumbled as U.S. payrolls climbed by 69,000 last
month, less than the most-pessimistic forecast. The jobless rate
rose to 8.2 percent. The Institute for Supply Management’s
factory index fell after reaching a 10-month high. Manufacturing
output shrank in Europe and slowed in China.  Economic Surprise  The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the U.S., which
measures how much data is missing or beating the median
estimates in Bloomberg surveys, fell to minus 53.6, the lowest
since September. It turned negative this year in April after
remaining above zero since October. The  Federal Reserve 
announced a program dubbed “Operation Twist” to boost growth
on Sept. 21, 2011, four months after the index turned negative.  Concern about a global economic slowdown and a worsening of
Europe’s debt crisis took the S&P 500 down for two straight
months. The gauge trimmed this year’s gain to 1.6 percent. The
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which measures
the cost of using options as insurance against declines in the
S&P 500, surged 11 percent to 26.66, the highest since December.  The S&P 500 approached a level which would represent a 10
percent decline from this year’s peak in April. The benchmark
gauge traded at  12.9 times  reported profits, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s 21 percent below its five-decade
average of 16.4.  Earnings (SPX)  in the S&P 500 are forecast to reach a
record $104.74 a share in 2012.  ‘Find Value’  “People are going to find value,” said  John Lynch , the
Charlotte-based regional chief investment officer for Wells
Fargo Private Bank. His firm manages $169 billion. “Given what
we know, I don’t see anything worse than a 10 percent correction
nor do I see a recession being priced in. Profits are at a
record. That’s an opportunity for the longer-term investor.”  Yet technical analysts say the S&P 500’s drop below its
200-day moving average could be a harbinger of losses. It’s a
“shot to the bulls,” said  Ryan Detrick , senior technical
strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati. The
next level of support for the gauge is 1,257, he said.  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
economic growth tumbled 3.6 percent. Bank of America lost 4.5
percent to $7.02. Apple sank 2.9 percent to $560.99. Boeing slid
3.4 percent to $67.24.  Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) , which got about 44
percent of revenue last year from stores in China, sank 8
percent to $64.70.  Homebuilders Plunge  A measure of homebuilders in S&P indexes tumbled the most
since August.  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM)  slumped 12 percent to $8.26. D.R.
Horton Inc. sank 8.4 percent to $15.21.  Casino companies dropped as Macau casino gambling revenue
rose 7.3 percent in May, the slowest pace since July 2009,
matching analysts’ estimates.  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) , the casino
company founded by billionaire  Steve Wynn , dropped 5.5 percent
to $97.38.  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)  lost 7 percent to $42.97.  Facebook Inc. (FB)  fell 6.4 percent to $27.72, after yesterday
posting the biggest gain since its initial public offering. The
company led U.S. IPOs to their worst  monthly performance  since
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed, as Europe’s debt crisis
scuttled IPO plans from New York to Hong Kong.  The  Bloomberg IPO Index (BIPO) , which tracks U.S. equities in the
first year after their IPOs, sank 15 percent last month, with
Facebook posting the worst one-week performance among the 30
largest U.S. IPOs since 2011. The index’s drop is in line with
the drop in October 2008, the month after Lehman’s bankruptcy
triggered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  Lockup Period  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  retreated 8.9 percent to $9.69. The largest
daily coupon website declined as a lockup period expired,
permitting insiders to sell shares.  New York Times Co. (NYT)  and Gannett Co. fell as Moody’s
Investors Service said the industry’s earnings will continue to
shrink this year. New York Times slid 4.4 percent to $6.36.
Gannett, owner of the  USA Today , sank 5.6 percent to $12.33.  Vera Bradley Inc. plunged 9.4 percent to $19.81, the lowest
price since its market debut in  October 2010. (VRA)  Citigroup Inc. and
Jefferies & Co. downgraded the stock following a lower annual
sales forecast by the maker of printed quilted handbags.  Gold producers jumped as signs of weakening job growth in
the U.S. fueled expectations that the Fed will take further
steps to spur growth, boosting the appeal of the precious metal
as an inflation hedge.  Newmont Mining (NEM) , the largest U.S. gold
producer, rallied 6.7 percent to $50.30.  More Stimulus  The Fed is more likely to provide added stimulus when its
current effort winds down, according to Morgan Stanley. The
probability of more central bank policy action is 80 percent, up
from 50 percent, the firm said. The Fed purchased $2.3 trillion
of debt in two rounds of quantitative easing that have become
known as QE1 and QE2. The FOMC meets June 20. “Operation
Twist” ends this month.  “We’re guessing that at the end of Operation Twist this
month, if we continue to see statistics like this, it will take
a very short span of time before the Fed either does another
Operation Twist or another QE3,” said Michael Mullaney, who
helps manage $9.5 billion as chief investment officer at
Fiduciary Trust in Boston. He spoke in a phone interview.  Economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York reduced
their forecast for third-quarter U.S. economic growth, citing
the slowdown in hiring and the global economy. The world’s
largest economy will expand at a 2 percent annual rate from July
through September, down from a previous estimate of 3 percent,
chief U.S. economist Michael Ferolisaid in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
