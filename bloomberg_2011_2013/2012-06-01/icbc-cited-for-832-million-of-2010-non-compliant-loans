Industrial & Commercial Bank of China
Ltd.  was found to have provided 5.3 billion yuan ($832 million)
of non-compliant loans in 2010, accounting for less than 1
percent of all credit it extended that year.  The loans that violated rules were given to projects that
failed to meet procedural and capital requirements as well as to
local government financing vehicles, the National Audit Office
said on its  website  today. ICBC “reasonably” controlled the
size of its loan disbursement, the auditor said.  Chinese banks lent a record $2.8 trillion in 2009 and 2010
as part of the government’s economic stimulus measures to combat
the effects of the global financial crisis. The scale of the
lending has spurred concerns that the nation’s banks will be
saddled by an increasing number of bad loans.  The 5.3 billion  yuan  of non-compliant loans in 2010 were
part of 9.5 billion yuan in total lending cited in the audit
office’s report as having violated rules. The auditor didn’t say
when the remaining loans were made.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
