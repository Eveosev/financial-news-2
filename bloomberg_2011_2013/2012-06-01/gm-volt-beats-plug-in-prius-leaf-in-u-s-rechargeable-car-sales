General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Chevrolet Volt
was the best-selling rechargeable auto in the U.S. in May,
topping  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s plug-in Prius and  Nissan Motor
Co. (7201) ’s all-electric Leaf hatchback.  Deliveries of the GM plug-in sedan more than tripled to
1,680 units from 481 a year earlier. Toyota sold 1,086 of
the Prius version, introduced in March, and Leaf sales slid
55 percent to 510 cars, the companies reported today.  The Volt gained after Detroit-based GM briefly halted
production of the car this year as inventory grew and as sales
cooled after news of battery-pack fires following crash tests.
Output resumed in April with structural reinforcements for
safety, as well as modifications that qualified the Volt for
rebates and carpool lane access in  California , the top market
for rechargeable autos.  Leaf sales have dropped the past two months as the
Yokohama, Japan-based company has changed how it sells the car,
now available in all 50 U.S. states, said  Al Castignetti , vice
president of Nissan’s North American sales.  “I have huge dispersion issues,” Castignetti said in an
interview today. “In places like California, dealers have
pretty good inventory, but I’ve got states that literally have
no Leafs, and we’ve got to address that.”  Sales of the Leaf, which goes an average of 73 miles
(117 kilometers) a charge, will rise to a minimum of 1,000 a
month by July, he said.  The Volt, which goes at least 35 miles on lithium-ion
battery power before a gasoline engine engages to propel the
car, remains the best-selling rechargeable car this year. Sales
through May more than tripled to 7,057, compared to 3,638 plug-
in Priuses and 2,613 Leafs.  The four-model Prius line from Toyota City, Japan-based
Toyota, which includes the plug-in version, is the biggest
seller among all electric-drive autos, with sales rising 210
percent to 21,477 in May and 73 percent to 107,504 for the year.  The Volt starts at $39,145, and qualifies for a $7,500
federal tax credit. The base model plug-in Prius costs $32,000,
before a $2,500 tax credit. Nissan’s Leaf, averaging 73 miles
per charge, starts at $35,200, according to a company  website ,
before a $7,500 credit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
