Gold is seen declining for a second
day and extending a fourth monthly loss in London on speculation
a stronger dollar will curb demand for the metal as an
alternative asset.  The dollar reached a 21-month high versus six major
currencies after a report indicated Chinese manufacturing grew
less than forecast last month and as leaders of  Italy  and the
 European Central Bank  clashed with Germany by demanding bolder
steps to stabilize euro-area economies. Hiring in the U.S.
probably picked up in May following the smallest gain in six
months, economists said before a government report today.  “On any sign of a strengthening dollar, you’ll see people
trying to take profits in gold at some point,” Bernard Sin, the
head of currency and metal trading at bullion refiner MKS
Finance SA in Geneva, said by phone today. “The non-farm
payrolls will drive the market” later today, he said.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1,557.82 an ounce by 9:12 a.m. in London. Prices dropped 6.3
percent in May for a fourth monthly decline, the longest losing
run since 1999. August-delivery futures were 0.3 percent lower
at $1,558.80 on the Comex in  New York .  The metal is down 0.4 percent this year after 11
consecutive annual increases. Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust,
the biggest exchange-traded product backed by bullion, were
unchanged at 1,270.3 metric tons yesterday, the company’s
website showed.  Gold slumped last month as the  Dollar Index  gained 5.4
percent on mounting concern that Europe’s debt crisis is
deepening. Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  and ECB President
 Mario Draghi  pushed Germany to give up its opposition to direct
euro-area aid for struggling banks.  Unemployment Steady  U.S. Payrolls climbed by 150,000 workers following a
115,000 April increase, according to economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The  unemployment rate  held at a three-year low
of 8.1 percent, the figures may show.  Silver for immediate delivery rose 0.2 percent to $27.745
an ounce. Prices slipped 11 percent last month and are down for
a sixth straight week, the worst performance since 2009.
Palladium fell 0.8 percent to $607.25 an ounce after last
month’s 10 percent slump. Platinum was 1.1 percent lower at
$1,399.25 an ounce. It declined 9.7 percent in May and is set
for a ninth consecutive weekly drop, the longest losing run
since at least 1987.  To contact the reporters on this story:
