Treasuries headed for their steepest
weekly gain in 2012 before reports that economists said will
show hiring in the U.S. picked up from the slowest pace in six
months while manufacturing growth waned.  U.S. yields slid to record lows yesterday as  Europe ’s
fiscal crisis and signs of ebbing in the pace of economic
expansion drove demand for the relative safety of American
government debt. Ten-year rates approached those in  Japan , which
are the lowest among the world’s 10 biggest debt markets. The
 difference  between the two narrowed to 73 basis points
yesterday, the least since 1990.  “For the past few months we have been accumulating,” said
Akira Takei, head of the international fixed-income department
in Tokyo at Mizuho Asset Management Co., which oversees about
$41.9 billion and is part of Japan’s second-biggest publicly
traded bank. “We are celebrating. My hunch is that the final
destination for U.S. Treasury yields will be to converge with
Japanese yields within a year or two.”  Benchmark U.S. 10-year  yields  were little changed at 1.57
percent as of 12:23 p.m. in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader data. The price of the 1.75 percent security due in May
2022 was 101 21/32.  The record low yield set yesterday was 1.53 percent. The
rate has declined 17 basis points this week, the most since the
period ended Dec. 16.  The 14-day relative-strength  index  for 10-year Treasury
yields fell to 26. A reading less than 30 suggests to some
traders that rates have declined too quickly and are set to
change direction.  Japan’s 10-year rate slid one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 0.82 percent. It has fallen for five
straight days.  Jobs Report  U.S. payrolls probably climbed by 150,000 in May, following
a 115,000 increase in April, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The  unemployment rate 
held at a three-year low of 8.1 percent, a separate set of
projections showed.  The Institute for Supply Management Inc.’s  factory index 
declined to 53.8 last month from 54.8 in April, according to
another Bloomberg survey.  The U.S. “is perceived as a liquidity haven and a quality
haven for the rest of the world,” said  Bill Gross , who runs the
world’s biggest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management Co.,
in an interview yesterday on Bloomberg Television’s “Street
Smart” with  Trish Regan . Investors view U.S. government
securities as “mattress money that’s safe, as opposed to a
risk.”  Long Bonds  Thirty-year bonds, among the securities most sensitive to
inflation because of their long maturity, are outperforming the
rest of the market.  The extra  yield  investors demand to buy the long bonds
instead of 10-year notes narrowed to 1.05 percentage points
yesterday, the least in four months. The average over the past
decade is 70 basis points.  Investors snapped up Treasuries last month on concern
 Greece ’s efforts to battle a recession will lead it to abandon
the euro. Ten-year yields climbed as high as 6.01 percent in
 Italy  and 6.70 percent in  Spain  as investors questioned whether
the countries will be able to pay their debts.  U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 1.9 percent annual
rate from January through March, down from a 2.2 percent prior
estimate, Commerce Department figures showed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
