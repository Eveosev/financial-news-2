The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
fell for a third day, sliding 0.7 percent to 859.2 in Prague,
the lowest close since Dec. 19.  The following were among the most active  equities  in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   of  Austria  lost 2.1 percent
to 356 koruna, after a 15 percent drop last month. European
stocks tumbled as China’s manufacturing growth slowed, euro-area
unemployment climbed to record high and U.S. employers added
fewer jobs than economists expected.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, slid 4.2 percent to 89.5 koruna, its lowest close
in almost three years. Commodities tumbled, sending  Europe ’s
