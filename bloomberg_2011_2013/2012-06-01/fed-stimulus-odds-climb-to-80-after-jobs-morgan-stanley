The  Federal Reserve  is more likely
provide added stimulus when its current effort winds down after
a report showed the economy added fewer jobs in May than
forecast, according to Morgan Stanley.  The probability of more central bank policy action is 80
percent, up from 50 percent, after the Labor Department reported
that U.S. employers added 69,000 jobs in May after an increase
of 77,000 the previous month. The median forecast of 85
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before today’s jobs
report, was for an increase of 150,000 jobs.  “Any optimism related to the improvement in labor market
conditions seen during the winter months is now fading away, and
financial conditions have tightened significantly since the
April Federal Open Market Committee meeting,”  David Greenlaw ,
Morgan Stanley’s chief fixed-income economist in New York, wrote
in a note to clients. “The Fed is likely to do what it can to
provide some support.”  The U.S. central bank is close to completing its program to
replace $400 billion of shorter-term debt in its holdings with
longer maturities by the end of this month to support the
economy by keeping down borrowing costs. The program, known as
Operation Twist, ends this month. The FOMC meets June 20.  The benchmark 10-year yield fell nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 1.47 percent in New York time, according to
Bloomberg Bond Traders prices. Thirty-year bond yields declined
nine basis points to 2.55 percent, reaching 2.5089 percent,
below the record 2.5090 percent on Dec. 18, 2008, according to
Federal Reserve figures beginning in 1953.  Morgan Stanley is one of the 21 primary dealers that trade
directly with the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
