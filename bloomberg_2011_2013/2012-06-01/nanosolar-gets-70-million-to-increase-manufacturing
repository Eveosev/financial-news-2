Nanosolar Inc., a closely held
manufacturer of thin-film solar cells, received $70 million in
 venture capital  to hire more people and increase production.  Investors included Mohr Davidow Ventures, Ohana Holdings
LLC and Arsenal Venture Partners, the  San Jose , California-based
company said today in a statement.  Nanosolar has shipped 10 megawatts of panels made with its
cells since it began selling them last year. Expanding its
workforce by about 10 percent will let it boost manufacturing,
Susan Lehman, a Nanosolar spokeswoman, said today by telephone.  “We’re expecting significant growth over last year,” she
said. The company has about 300 employees now.  Nanosolar’s cells are printed onto aluminum foil using inks
made of copper-indium-gallium-selenide, an approach that the
company says is less expensive than conventional silicon-based
solar cells.  Its factory in Luckenwalde, Germany, can make about 115
megawatts of panels a year from cells that are printed in
California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
