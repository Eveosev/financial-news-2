The  International Cotton Advisory
Committee  boosted its forecast for a global surplus of the fiber
in the year starting Aug. 1 as consumption eases.  The surplus will be 14.46 million metric tons, up 1.2
percent from last month’s projection and 9 percent from the
previous year’s estimate, the Washington-based group said today
in a report. Reserves in  China , the world’s biggest grower and
consumer, may increase again in the 12 months ending July 31,
2013, the committee said.  Global inventory probably will “weigh on international
cotton prices,” while “volatility may increase due to the
uncertainty related to the Chinese national reserve,” the group
said.  World production will be 25.1 million tons, down 0.6
percent from the May estimate and 7.4 percent from the previous
season “following the plunge in world prices,” the group said.
Cotton futures in  New York  have plummeted 51 percent in the past
year. The U.S. is the top exporter.  Global use will be 23.9 million tons, down 0.6 percent from
the May forecast and up 3.4 percent from the previous season,
according to the report.  China’s imports may drop to 3.3 million tons from a record
4.6 million, the group said. Purchases by the rest of the world
may rise 15 percent to 4.8 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
