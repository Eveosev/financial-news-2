German exports to southern  Europe 
plunged in the first quarter as austerity measures in nations
hit by the sovereign debt crisis curbed demand.  Exports to  Portugal  slumped 14 percent from a year earlier,
while sales to  Greece  sank 9.8 percent, the Federal Statistics
Office in Wiesbaden said in a statement today. Spain bought 7.8
percent less from Germany, and Italian orders dropped 7.6
percent.  Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy are all in recession as
their governments cut spending in an effort to regain investor
confidence. Germany has turned to faster-growing markets outside
Europe to compensate. Overall, its exports rose 5.8 percent in
the first quarter from the same period in 2011, todayâ€™s report
showed.  Sales to countries outside the 27-nation European Union
jumped 11.2 percent, with exports to the U.S. surging 21.4
percent.  Germany  sold 18.4 percent more to Japan, 17.5 percent
more to Russia and 6.1 percent more to China in the period.  Exports to neighboring euro-area nations France and the
Netherlands rose 6.7 percent and 9.6 percent respectively, while
those to the U.K. increased 8.2 percent.  Total German imports rose 4.7 percent in the first quarter
from the first three months in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
