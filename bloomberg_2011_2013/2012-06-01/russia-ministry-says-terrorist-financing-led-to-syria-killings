The massacre of more than 100 people
in the town of Houla showed what the “financing of terrorists”
can lead to, Alexander Lukashevich, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman, said in a statement.  Attempts at countering the Syrian conflict with the
“threat of a foreign intervention” are unlikely to bring
positive results, Lukashevich said in a statement on the
ministry’s website.  Insurgents in  Syria  are responsible for more than 3,000
violations of a cease-fire since May 12, Riad Haddad, the
country’s envoy in Moscow, told reporters in the Russian capital
today. Russia’s supply of weapons to Syria is propping up the
Assad regime, U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said at a
press briefing today in Oslo.  Russian President Vladimir Putin today said in Germany that
Russia doesn’t support either side in the Syrian conflict and
believes it’s too early to conclude that the peace plan by
United Nations envoy  Kofi Annan ’s has failed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
