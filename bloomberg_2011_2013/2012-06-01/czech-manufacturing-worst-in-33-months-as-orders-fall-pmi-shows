Czech manufacturing performed the
worst in 33 months in May as new orders declined at the fastest
pace in almost three years, an industry gauge showed.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI fell to 47.6, the
lowest since August 2009, from 49.7 in April, the bank said
today in an e-mailed report. A result greater than 50 signals
improvement in manufacturing performance, while a figure below
signals a worsening.  Gross domestic product  unexpectedly  fell 1 percent in the
first three months of 2012 from the final quarter of 2011,
preliminary data showed, as the state cut spending to narrow the
fiscal  deficit  to less than the European Union’s limit of 3
percent of GDP next year. The economy relies on demand for cars,
auto parts and electronics goods from the EU, which buys about
80 percent of Czech exports.  “It is hard to beat the bad news conveyed by a much deeper
than expected GDP contraction in the first quarter of this year
and in this sense, the weakening PMI comes as no surprise,”
 Agata Urbanska , an economist at HSBC Bank Plc in  London , said in
the release. “But the PMI index still points to downside risks
in the coming quarters.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
