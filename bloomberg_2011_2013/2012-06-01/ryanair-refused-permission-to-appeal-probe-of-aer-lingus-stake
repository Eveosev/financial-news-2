Ryanair Holdings Plc, Europe’s
biggest discount airline, lost its bid to challenge a U.K.
antitrust regulator’s decision to seek an investigation into its
minority stake in Irish competitor  Aer Lingus Group Plc. (AERL)   The U.K.’s supreme court ruled today that Ryanair doesn’t
have the right to appeal a lower court ruling that the Office of
Fair Trading was entitled to ask the  Competition Commission  to
examine Ryanair’s  holding  in Aer Lingus.  “The OFT can now proceed swiftly to complete its
investigation into Ryanair’s shareholding which is contrary to
the interests of consumers and the majority of Aer Lingus’
shareholders,” Aer Lingus said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
