The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  fell for a
third day, retreating 0.6 percent to 1,298.08 by the close in
Moscow. The gauge declined 11 percent last month, the most since
September.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  OAO Sberbank (SBER RX) declined 3.7 percent to 78.75
rubles, the most in more than a week. Russia’s largest lender
slipped as the ruble headed for the steepest two-week slump
among global currencies tracked by Bloomberg. A weaker ruble
encourages Russians to withdraw and convert ruble deposits,
Sberbank’s main source of funding.  TNK-BP (TNBP RX) dropped 10 percent to 70 rubles, the
lowest level since the stock listing in December 2010. Russia’s
third-largest oil producer dropped to a record low after BP Plc
said it will pursue a sale of its 50 percent holding in the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
