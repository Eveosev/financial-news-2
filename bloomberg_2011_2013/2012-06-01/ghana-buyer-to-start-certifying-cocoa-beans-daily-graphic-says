The Ghana Cocoa Board has granted
 Federated Commodities Ltd. , a licensed buyer of the beans, a
permit to start a cocoa traceability and certification program,
the Daily Graphic reported, citing Managing Director Alhaji
Abdul Razak Adamu.  The plan involves tracing the beans to the source of
production and ensuring that farmers produce to set standards,
the Accra-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
