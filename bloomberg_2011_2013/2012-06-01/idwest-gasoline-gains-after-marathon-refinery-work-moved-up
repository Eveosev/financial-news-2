Midwest gasoline rose after  Marathon
Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  rescheduled planned maintenance at the Robinson
refinery in Illinois, moving it to this month from July.  The crude unit at the plant will shut for about three weeks
starting around June 9, said a person with knowledge of the
situation. The plant can process 215,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Midwest, or Group 3, narrowed 10.12 cents to 0.38 cent versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:39 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the highest level
since Nov. 9. Prompt delivery fell 6.95 cents to $2.6505 a
gallon.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  will cut processing rates by more than half at
the  Mandan refinery  in  North Dakota  on about June 11 for planned
work that will increase the plant’s capacity, a person with
knowledge of the schedule said.  Conventional gasoline in Chicago rose 6 cents to a premium
of 11 cents versus futures.  BP Plc (BP)  shut the smallest of three crude units at the
Whiting refinery in Indiana for unplanned maintenance because of
a malfunction, a person familiar with the situation said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
