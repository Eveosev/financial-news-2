Russian stocks dropped for a third
day as tumbling  oil prices  curbed demand for equities in the
world’s biggest energy exporter.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  declined 0.6 percent to 1,298.08 by the
close in Moscow, paring its gain this week to 1.3 percent. The
benchmark gauge retreated 11 percent last month, the most since
September. OAO Sberbank, the country’s biggest bank, slid 3.7
percent as the ruble sank to a three-year low. TNK-BP, Russia’s
third-largest oil company, lost 10 percent, falling to a record
low after BP Plc said it is seeking to sell its 50 percent stake
in the venture, unwinding a nine-year investment.  Crude slumped as much as 4.6 percent after worse-than-
expected U.S. and Chinese economic data stoked concern demand
will fall. Russian stocks trade at 4.7 times  estimated earnings ,
having lost 7.4 percent this year. That compares with a 2.3
percent drop for the  MSCI Emerging-Market Index (MXEF)  which trades at
9.2 times projected earnings.  Chinese data “raises concerns about a more broadly based
slowdown,”  Chris Weafer ,  Troika Dialog ’s chief strategist in
Moscow, said in an e-mailed note. Oil “reacted negatively to
the data. The continuing risk aversion across all markets will
also keep pressure on the ruble and on banking sector shares.”  China ’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index declined to 50.4 in May
from 53.3 in April, the statistics bureau said. The U.S. jobless
rate rose to 8.2 percent from 8.1 percent, according to today’s
data.  The dollar-denominated RTS Index fell 1.2 percent to
1,227.32, according to data on the Micex-RTS Exchange’s website.
Citigroup Inc. cut its RTS estimate for 2012 to 1,600 from 2,000
after lowering its 2013 oil price estimate 18 percent to $99.
 Russia  received almost 50 percent of budget revenue from oil and
gas sales last year.  Ruble Deposits  Sberbank dropped to 78.75 rubles as the ruble depreciated
0.6 percent to 33.68 per dollar. A weaker ruble encourages
Russians to withdraw and convert ruble deposits, Sberbank’s main
source of funding.  Russia-focused equity funds posted $8 million in outflows
for the period ended May 30, according to VTB Capital and Troika
Dialog, which cited EPFR Global data. Russians funds lost $361
million in May, compared to an outflow of $1.1 billion from
China and $659 million from Brazil, Troika’s strategist Chris Weafer said in an e-mailed note.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index fell 1.2 percent to 895.03
today, the lowest intraday level in more than a week, while the
MSCI BRIC Index of shares traded in India,  Brazil , Russia and
China, dropped 1 percent.  TNK-BP Sale  TNK-BP plunged to 70 rubles by the close, the lowest level
since the company’s shares were listed on the Micex in December
2010. The stock trades at 3.9 times estimated earnings.  The sale of TNK-BP, which analysts said could raise at
least $30 billion, would dismantle BP’s landmark venture, the
largest foreign investment in Russia’s oil industry.  OAO Rosneft and Rosneftegaz, the state company that owns
it, “never thought about” buying BP Plc’s 50 percent holding
in the TNK-BP Russian oil venture, said Chief Executive Officer
 Igor Sechin , a former deputy to  Vladimir Putin .  Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil producer, will consider the
market situation and make a decision on a potential bid later,
Sechin added. The company’s shares fell 0.7 percent to 205.96
rubles after declining as much as 2.8 percent earlier.  The stake sale would be “negative” for TNK-BP “if it
resulted in TNK-BP lagging behind other Russian oil majors or
led to an increase in leverage,” Fitch Ratings Ltd. analysts
led by Jeffrey Woodruff said in an e-mailed note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
