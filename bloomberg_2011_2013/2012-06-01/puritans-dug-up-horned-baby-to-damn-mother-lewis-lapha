Boston resident Mary Dyer gave birth
to a stillborn girl in October 1637, with a badly deformed head,
spine and limbs. The grieving parents buried her quietly.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  A deeply religious woman, Dyer believed anyone could read
and interpret the Bible. Trying to maintain order in a harsh new
world, the Puritans deemed this the antinomian heresy, and
suspected her of hobnobbing with Satan.  To find evidence, Governor John Winthrop had the infant’s
corpse disinterred. He described the monster as “a woman child,
a fish, a beast, and a fowl all woven together in one, and
without an head.” She had “upon each foot three claws, like a
young fowl,” and most damning of all, “four horns” where her
forehead should have been.  Dyer was banished. She later became a Quaker preacher, and
to protest the harsh treatment of the Friends at the hands of
the Puritans, she returned to  Boston .  On June 1, 1660, magistrates hanged her from a tree on
Boston Common and buried her in an unmarked grave.  I spoke with Mark Fiege, author of “The Republic of
Nature: An Environmental History of the United States,” on the
following topics:  1. Iconic Moments  2. Puritan Witchcraft  3. Revolutionary Freedom  4. Lincoln’s Nature  5. Natural Limits  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  (Lewis Lapham is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
