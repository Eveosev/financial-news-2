Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL) ,
 Turkey ’s biggest mobile phone company, climbed in Istanbul after
saying shareholders will meet on June 29 to discuss earnings and
dividends from last year and 2010.  Turkcell rose 2.2 percent to 8.32 liras at the close on the
main ISE National 100 index, gaining for the first time in three
days.  A dispute over control of Turkcell between Cukurova Holding
of Turkey,  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  and Russia’s Altimo has blocked the
dividends. The meeting was called by statutory auditors,
Turkcell said in a filing with the exchange today.  Board changes at Turkcell may also be discussed, according
to the meeting’s agenda.  As the  shareholders’ meeting  was called by auditors not the
board, Turkcell’s owners should agree on the items beforehand to
ensure they’re approved, Alper Ozdemir, an analyst at broker
Oyak Securities in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed report to
clients today.  “It should be expected that most of the agenda items will
remain unapproved if the board could not agree on the
aforementioned items until June 29, which was the case in the
last three general assemblies,” Ozdemir said.  Turkcell’s shares have dropped 6 percent this year compared
with an advance of 8.4 percent for the main ISE National 100
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
