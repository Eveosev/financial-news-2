Cooler-than-normal temperatures may
dominate the U.S. Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions next week
before giving way to a gradual warm-up by the middle of June.  Temperatures from  Maine  to North Carolina may reach 6
degrees Fahrenheit (3.3 Celsius) below normal from June 7 to 11,
said  David Salmon , owner of Weather Derivatives in Belton,
Missouri. Much of the rest of the eastern U.S. will be seasonal.  Cooler air may reduce spikes in electricity demand because
people are less likely to use air conditioners. Heat may mean
more need for natural gas because many utilities turned to that
fuel to produce power as prices dropped.  In the June 11 to June 15 period, warmer air may begin
returning to the Midwest and East Coast, said  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  Rogers said at least one computer forecast model suggests
there will be a quick return to higher-than-normal temperatures
after next week. He said he favors a “more gradual return” for
the heat in his 11- to 15-day outlook.  The normal average temperature in  New York  for June 7 is
about 70 degrees, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. It’s 65 in Boston, 73 in Washington, 76
in Atlanta, 82 in Houston, 80 in Dallas, 60 in Seattle and 68 in
Burbank, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
