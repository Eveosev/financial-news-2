Tiger Woods trails leader Rory Sabbatini by one shot heading into today’s third round of the
U.S. PGA Tour’s Memorial Tournament.  Woods, a four-time winner of the tournament at Muirfield
Village Golf Club in Dublin,  Ohio , shot a 3-under 69 yesterday
to reach the halfway point tied for second place at 5 under with
fellow Americans Spencer Levin and Scott Stallings.  Woods, who birdied three of his first six holes in the
second round to move into a tie for the lead, had a double-bogey
on the par-3 12th hole to fall two shots back before adding
birdies on the 15th and 16th holes.  Sabbatini, a South African, had five birdies and two bogeys
in a round of 3 under yesterday.  Northern Ireland ’s Rory McIlroy and Masters champion  Bubba
Watson  of the U.S. both missed the two-round cut. McIlroy has
failed to reach weekend play at three straight tournaments since
moving back to the No. 1 world ranking.  The event is hosted by 18-time major tournament winner  Jack Nicklaus .  To contact the reporter on this story:
