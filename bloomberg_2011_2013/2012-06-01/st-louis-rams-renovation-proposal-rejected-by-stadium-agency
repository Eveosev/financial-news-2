The  St. Louis  Rams’ proposal to use
public money to renovate the Edward Jones Dome was rejected by
the authority that runs the 17-year-old stadium.  The St. Louis Convention and Visitors Commission said in a
 statement  that it wouldn’t approve the National Football League
team’s proposal, adding the authority “believes that it is in
the best interests of the community and the Rams to engage in
meaningful dialogue over the next two weeks, and looks forward
to the opportunity to do so at the earliest convenience of Rams
management.”  Team spokesman Artis Twyman didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail seeking comment.  The Rams’ plan included concourse expansions, new party
zones and luxury amenities that would cost more than $700
million, Jeff Rainford, chief of staff to Mayor Francis Slay,
told the  St. Louis Post-Dispatch .  The lease between the authority and the team requires that
the dome earn as much as the top quarter of NFL stadiums. The
Rams rejected a $124 million renovation proposed by the
commission in February. If the two sides can’t reach an
agreement before June 15, the dispute moves to arbitration.  The Rams moved to St. Louis from  Los Angeles  before the
1995 season and play in the publicly financed, $280 million
stadium originally known as the Trans World Dome.  To contact the reporter on this story:
