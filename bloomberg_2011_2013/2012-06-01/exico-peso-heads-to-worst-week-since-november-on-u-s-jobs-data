Mexico ’s peso headed for its fifth
consecutive weekly drop as an increase in U.S. unemployment
damped the economic outlook for the Latin American country’s
biggest trading partner.  The currency pared its losses against the dollar on
speculation central banks globally may boost stimulus to spur
growth, according to  Mario Copca , a currency strategist at
Metanalisis SA in Mexico City. The peso was the biggest loser in
May among the 16 most-traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg,
declining 9.5 percent.  The peso was little changed at 14.3753 per dollar at 1:42
p.m. in Mexico City after falling as much as 1.5 percent to
14.5997, the weakest intraday level since March 30, 2009. The
currency is down 2.3 percent this week.  The earlier selloff “was very exaggerated,” Javier
Benavides, a currency trader at Banco Base SA in San Pedro Garza
Garcia, Mexico, said in a telephone interview. “It responded
very badly to the nonfarm payroll data that came out in the
morning.”  U.S. payrolls climbed by 69,000 last month, the Labor
Department reported today in  Washington . That was less than the
most-pessimistic forecast compiled by Bloomberg after a revised
77,000 gain in April that was smaller than initially estimated.
The median estimate called for a 150,000 advance in May. The
 unemployment rate  increased to 8.2 percent.  U.S. Economy  The gross domestic product of the U.S. climbed at a 1.9
percent annual rate from January through March, down from a
prior estimate of 2.2 percent expansion, revised Commerce
Department figures showed yesterday. The Mexican economy depends
on exports for about 30 percent of its gross domestic product.  Mexico’s central bank intervened in the foreign-exchange
market for the second time in two weeks yesterday, selling $107
million of reserves to slow the peso’s drop. It sold dollars for
the first time since December 2009 on May 23.  Since November, the central bank has been offering $400
million daily at an exchange rate that is at least 2 percent
weaker than the previous day’s official fix level. It didn’t
sell any of its reserves in the first two of three auctions
scheduled for today.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.22 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.53
centavo to 132.87 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
