South Korea , the world’s fifth-
largest oil importer, purchased the most last month since
October even as unit prices increased.  Crude imports rose 12 percent to 81.1 million barrels in
May from 72.3 million barrels a year earlier, the Ministry of
 Knowledge Economy  said in an e-mailed  statement  today. That was
the biggest amount since 83 million barrels in October.  South Korea, which depends on nuclear power for a third of
its electricity, has suspended two reactors for safety checks
and shifted to coal and other fossil fuels.  The country’s bill for crude imports rose 18 percent to $10
billion as prices climbed 5.4 percent to $123.90 a barrel, the
ministry said, citing preliminary figures for last month. Gas
import costs gained 22 percent to $2.37 billion in May, while
coal costs fell 5.7 percent to $1.39 billion, according to the
ministry.  Oil-product exports rose 0.9 percent to $4.58 billion from
a year earlier. Petrochemical exports fell 17 percent to $3.23
billion, the ministry said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
