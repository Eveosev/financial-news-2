European naphtha plunged to the
lowest in 19 months as Vitol Group sold a cargo.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought barges of jet fuel at lower
premiums to gasoil than yesterday. Gasoil futures fell to the
lowest level in more than 15 months as  Brent crude  plunged to
less than $99 a barrel.  The market will be closed on June 4 and June 5 because of
public holidays in the U.K.  Light Products  Morgan Stanley bought the 12,500-ton naphtha cargo at $747
a metric ton, according to a survey of the Platts pricing window
which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. That’s the lowest price
since Oct. 27, 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Naphtha’s  discount  to Brent narrowed to $12.84 a barrel
from $13.82 yesterday, data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a
broker in London show.  European producers may ship four times as much naphtha to
Asia in June than they did a year earlier as sluggish global
demand leads to the worst refining losses on the feedstock in
six months.  At least 400,000 tons of the fuel, used to make gasoline
and petrochemicals, may be transported to  Asia , according to the
median estimate of seven traders and shipbrokers surveyed by
Bloomberg yesterday. That’s the same amount as last month and
quadruple the 100,000 tons shipped in June last year.  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp changed hands from $936 to $975 a ton,
according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the
Argus Bulletin Board and Platts. That’s the lowest since Dec. 30
and compares with yesterday’s deals at $965 to $986.  The trades were for Eurobob grade to which ethanol is added
to make finished fuel. Barge deals are typically for lots of
1,000 tons or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s  premium  to Brent dropped to $9.91 a barrel as of
2:59 p.m. local time, PVM data show. That’s the lowest spread
since May 17.  Middle Distillates  Shell bought  jet fuel  barges at premiums of $70 and $71 a
ton to June gasoil, the survey of Platts showed. BP Plc and
Vitol sold. That compares with a deal yesterday at $74.  Diesel barges traded at premiums of $14 and $14.25 a ton to
June gasoil, the survey showed. That’s higher than deals
yesterday at $13.  Heating oil  barges  traded at premiums of $1 to June
futures, according to the survey.  Gasoil for June delivery dropped as much as $26, or 3
percent, to $844.75 a ton, the lowest intraday price since Feb.
8, 2011. The contract traded at $851.25 as of 5:06 p.m. local
time on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London . The July
futures contract was at $845.75, widening its discount to $5.50
from $4 yesterday.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability, rose
to $14.90 a barrel from $14.43 yesterday, ICE data show. Brent
plunged 3.1 percent to $98.70 a barrel. That’s the lowest since
Jan. 27, 2011.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded at $563 to $564.50 a ton, the
survey of Platts showed. That’s lower than yesterday’s deals at
$585.25 to $591.  Refineries  The Petit-Couronne refinery in France, owned by Petroplus
Holdings AG before it filed for insolvency earlier this year,
will start operating on June 14 under a tolling arrangement with
Shell.  Shell will provide 100,000 barrels a day of crude to be
refined and sold by Petroplus Marketing  France , according to a
statement from Petroplus Raffinage Petit-Couronne, which has
been under court administration since Jan. 25.  Statoil ASA will be able to deliver fuel from  Norway ’s
biggest refinery after striking government workers agreed to
make exceptions for individual ships, delaying a potential halt.  Pilot boat workers on strike agreed to grant dispensation
for the most “critical” shipments of refined products from the
Mongstad refinery on Norway’s west coast, Statoil spokesman
Morten Eek said today. The exemptions from the Confederation of
Vocational Unions buys a few more days, Eek said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
