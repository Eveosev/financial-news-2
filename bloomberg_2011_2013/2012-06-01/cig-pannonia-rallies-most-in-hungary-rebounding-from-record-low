CIG Pannonia Eletbiztosito Nyrt. (PANNONIA) , a
Hungarian life insurer, rebounded from its lowest on record and
was the best performer on the benchmark stock index today.  The stock jumped 2.7 percent to 271 forint by 9:57 a.m. in
Budapest, the most in the  BUX (BUX)  gauge, which gained 0.8 percent.  CIG Pannonia tumbled 37 percent last month to its lowest
since the company started traded in November 2010, driving the
stockâ€™s 14-day  relative strength index  to 19 yesterday. Readings
lower than 30 suggest in technical analysts an asset may gain.
