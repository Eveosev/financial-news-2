New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech producer of coking coal, had the biggest weekly drop in
eight months as worse-than-expected U.S. payrolls data and a
manufacturing slowdown in China hurt demand for commodities.  The stock dropped 4.2 percent at 89.5 koruna by the close
in Prague, the lowest since July 2009. The stock lost 11 percent
this week, the most since the five days ended Sept. 23. Share
turnover today was almost triple the three-month daily average.  Commodities tumbled as May U.S. payrolls rose by 69,000,
missing the lowest forecast in a Bloomberg survey, and China’s
purchasing managers’ index declined. Europe’s benchmark coal
derivatives dropped to $98.75 a metric ton, the lowest since
September 2010, in the Netherlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
