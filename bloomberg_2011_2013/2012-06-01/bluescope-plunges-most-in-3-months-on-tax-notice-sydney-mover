BlueScope Steel Ltd. (BSL) ,  Australia â€™s
biggest steelmaker, plunged to a record after saying it may have
to pay an additional tax of as much as A$140 million ($136
million) for past transactions.  The shares fell 7.3 percent to 32 Australian cents at the
close of trading, the lowest price since the shares listed on
July 15, 2002. The key S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.3 percent.  The Australian Taxation Office advised BlueScope it will
further assess its tax payments in relation to a fundraising
exercise in 2007, the Melbourne-based company said in a stock
exchange  filing  today. Any additional payment would hurt
BlueScope, which may report a loss of A$610 million in the year
ending June 30, according to the median of six analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  BlueScope, which booked a  loss  of A$530 million for the six
months ended Dec. 31, said today the evaluation could increase
its tax liability to as much as A$140 million under the first
assessment and between A$51 million and A$63 million under the
second assessment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
