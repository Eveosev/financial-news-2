Peru’s sol gained for the first time
in two weeks after the central bank stepped up dollar sales to
meet demand for the U.S. currency spurred by  Europe ’s debt
crisis.  The sol strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.7055 per  U.S. dollar 
from 2.7075 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local
unit. The currency weakened 0.3 percent this week.  The central bank sold $674 million this week, tapping into
$57 billion in foreign currency reserves as the local currency
erased its 2012 gains. It didn’t sell dollars today. The bank
began selling dollars on May 25 for the first time since
October.  There was “a big selloff by Peruvian standards so you have
the central bank selling dollars to boost supply,” said Felipe Hernandez, an economist at RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut .  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.35 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price fell 0.06 centimo to 116.29 centimos per
sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
