RG Steel LLC, the fourth-biggest U.S.
maker of flat-rolled steel, won court approval to borrow as much
as $50 million to help fund operations while it works toward a
sale of its assets.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey in Wilmington,  Delaware ,
today approved the interim loan from existing lenders led by
agent Wells Fargo Capital Finance LLC. Carey called milestones
within the loan “aggressive,” which the company must meet as
part of the financing requirements.  RG Steel, based in Sparrows Point,  Maryland , listed assets
and debts of more than $1 billion each in Chapter 11 documents
filed yesterday when it sought court protection.  The steelmaker needed the loan to keep the mills
operational while it pursues a sale of virtually all its assets.
Deadlines include a sale by July 27.  “The lenders have agreed to provide a lifeline however
short” so RG Steel “can pursue a sale,” Shaunna D. Jones, a
lawyer representing the company, told Carey. “Conversations
have been happening with potential purchasers.”  The bankruptcy loan gives the company as much as
$30 million in available funds through June 15 and then up to an
additional $20 million from June 16 to July 27, court documents
show.  The lead case is In re WP Steel Venture LLC, 12-11661,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
