Former Galleon Group LLC trader Franz Tudor, who cooperated with the U.S. government’s investigation
of  insider trading  at  hedge funds , was sentenced to three years’
probation for conspiracy and securities fraud.  Tudor, who pleaded guilty in October 2009, helped the
government win a guilty plea from former Diamondback Capital
portfolio manager Anthony Scolaro and aided in the prosecution
of others charged with trading on illegal tips, including former
Galleon trader  Zvi Goffer , according to the U.S. He was
sentenced in Manhattan federal court today.  “Your cooperation is very impressive,” said U.S. District
Richard Sullivan, in explaining his decision to give Tudor a
non-prison sentence. “It was immediate, it was substantial and
it was time-consuming. You did it over a long period of time.”  Prosecutors said that Tudor, while working as a trader at
Schottenfeld Group LLC, made $86,000 for his own account and for
his firm by trading in shares of Axcan Pharma Inc. based on
inside information from Goffer. He began cooperating with
federal agents in October 2008, agreeing to record conversations
with others suspected of insider trading.  In addition to the term of probation, Sullivan fined Tudor
$20,000 and ordered him to forfeit $86,000.  The case is U.S. v. Tudor, 09-CR-1057, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
