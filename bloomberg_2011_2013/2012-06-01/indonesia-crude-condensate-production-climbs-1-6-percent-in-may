Indonesia ’s crude and condensate
output rose 1.6 percent in May as some production facilities
resumed operations.  Indonesia pumped an average 883,300 barrels a day of  crude 
and condensate last month, up from 869,800 barrels in April,
Rudi Rubiandini, deputy of operations at BPMigas, the nation’s
oil and gas regulator, said in a phone text message today.  Output may reach 890,000 barrels a day in June and recover
to 900,000 barrels daily in August as new wells start producing,
Rubiandini said. Indonesia’s oil supply may average 904,000
barrels this year, he said.  There are 15 new oil and gas fields expected to start
production in 2012, which will help stem a decline in the
country’s production, BPMigas said Dec. 19. Indonesia,  Southeast
Asia ’s largest crude producer, withdrew from the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries in 2008 because of reduced
overseas shipments as output dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
