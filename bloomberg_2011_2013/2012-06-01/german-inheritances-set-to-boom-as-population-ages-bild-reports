Germans are set for an inheritance
windfall as the population ages, with one in five estates
expected to exceed 100,000 euros ($123,500), Bild Zeitung
reported, citing a study by the Allensbach research institute.  Two in three inheritances in coming years will include the
transfer of a house or an apartment as the real-estate assets of
German pensioners double to 3.2 billion euros over the next 18
years, Bild said.  The number of Germans older than 80 years has increased by
two-thirds since 2000, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
