ATP Oil & Gas Corp. (ATPG) , the Gulf of
Mexico explorer that has dropped 70 percent in the past year,
said ex-Dynamic Offshore Resources LLC head Matt McCarroll will
become its chief executive officer.  McCarroll, who led Dynamic Offshore until it was acquired
by  SandRidge Energy Inc. (SD)  for $1.3 billion last year, takes over
the CEO position from Chairman and founder Paul Bulmahn,
Houston-based ATP said in a statement today. McCarroll bought 1
million shares of ATP today at market price to show his
“commitment” to the company, it said.  ATP shares have been battered by production delays, missed
output targets and a cash crunch that jeopardized its ability to
cover debt payments. Earlier today, the company announced
completion efforts had resumed in a well in the Mississippi
Canyon region of the Gulf that had been stalled by a stranded
piece of pipe.  The stock fell 0.6 percent to $5.25 at the close in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
