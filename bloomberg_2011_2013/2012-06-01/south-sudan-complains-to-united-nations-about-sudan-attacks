South Sudan  filed a complaint to the
 United Nations  Security Council alleging that attacks are
continuing by Sudan even as the two countries are negotiating a
peace agreement.  South Sudan’s government complained yesterday that Sudan
was undertaking aerial and ground attacks and failed to withdraw
its forces from the disputed territory of Abyei, both of which
would be violations of a resolution passed by the council on May
2, according to an e-mailed statement today from the
administration.  “This is a test of the resolve and credibility of the UN
Security Council itself,” the government said in the statement.  Officials from Sudan and South Sudan began meeting on May
29 in the Ethiopian capital,  Addis Ababa , to negotiate
agreements on issues outstanding since the South declared
independence on July 9.  Points of contention include the status of Abyei, border
demarcation and fees South Sudan should pay to export its oil
through pipelines and processing facilities in Sudan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
