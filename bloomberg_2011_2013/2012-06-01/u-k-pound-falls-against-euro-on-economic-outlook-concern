U.K. government bonds rose, pushing
yields across all maturities to record lows below 3 percent, as
investors sought safety amid signs  Europe ’s financial crisis is
slowing global growth.  Ten-year  gilts  advanced for a third day after Spanish
Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said the future of the euro was
at stake in Italy and  Spain , and a U.S. report showed employers
hired fewer workers than economists forecast. The pound fell to
the weakest in four months against the dollar after a gauge of
U.K. manufacturing slid to the lowest since the depths of the
global financial crisis in 2009.  “Gilts yields at these excessively low levels can only be
explained by  risk aversion  in the market as the euro debt crisis
drags on without signs of a solution,” said Mohit Kumar, head
of European interest-rate strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in
 London . “We find gilts very expensive but as long as concern
over the debt crisis continues, yields may go lower.”  The  yield  on the 10-year gilt fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 1.52 percent at 4:12 p.m. in London
after dropping to 1.439 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg
began tracking the data on 1989. The 4 percent bond due March
2022 rose 0.445, or 4.45 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,531) face
amount, to 122.36. The yield slid 23 basis points this week.  Note Advance  The  five-year yield  dropped as much as eight basis points
to a record 0.556 percent. The  30-year yield  declined to an all-
time low 2.76 percent, after being as high as 3.52 percent on
March 16.  Yields on 10-year German bonds and U.S. Treasuries also
fell to all-time lows as signs the global economy is stalling
drove demand for the safest  government securities .  “I don’t know if we’re on the edge of the precipice, but
we’re in a very, very, very difficult situation,” de Guindos
told a conference in Sitges, Spain, yesterday. The euro area is
in real danger of disintegrating unless policy makers revamp the
bloc’s fiscal and economic ties, Economic and Monetary
Commissioner Olli Rehn said today in Helsinki.  U.S. payrolls climbed by 69,000 last month, less than the
most-pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, after a
revised 77,000 gain in April that was smaller than initially
estimated, the Labor Department said in  Washington . The median
estimate was for a 150,000 advance in May.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year U.K. gilts
instead of two-year notes shrank to 1.27 percentage points, the
least since October 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg based on closing prices. The narrowing spread shows
traders are betting the inflation rate will slow.  Pound Falls  The pound weakened for a fifth day against the yen after
Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply  said their index of U.K. manufacturing dropped to 45.9 in
May, the first reading below 50 this year.  Sterling declined for a second day versus the euro as the
British Chambers of Commerce predicted the U.K. economy will
barely expand this year. Gross domestic product will grow 0.1
percent in 2012 as turmoil from the euro-area debt crisis hurts
demand, the London-based organization said.  “With our largest trading partner in recession, we could
be in for a very tough year with few signs of recovery,” said
Andy Scott, an account manager at currency specialist HiFX in
Windsor, west of London. Lack of growth will make “monetary
easing all the more likely, increasing the risk of the pound
dropping below $1.50.”  The pound fell 0.3 percent to $1.5357 after dropping to
$1.5269, the weakest since Jan. 13. Sterling depreciated 0.5
percent to 120.06 yen after sliding to 118.81 yen, the lowest
since Jan. 19. It declined 0.4 percent to 80.60 pence per euro.  The U.K. currency has strengthened 2 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies, the second-best performer after
the dollar, which gained 3.4 percent.  Gilts returned 17 percent over the past year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained 15 percent,
and U.S. Treasuries rose nine percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
