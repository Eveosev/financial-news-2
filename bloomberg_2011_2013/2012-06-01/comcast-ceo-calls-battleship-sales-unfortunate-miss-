Universal Pictures’ “Battleship”
film was “an unfortunate miss” that will contribute to a
negative second-quarter at  NBC Universal , said  Brian Roberts ,
chief executive officer of parent  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)   “The Five-Year Engagement,” also released in the current
quarter, was another big miss for the studio, Roberts said today
at a Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. investor conference in New York.  NBC Universal benefited a year ago from movie hits
including “Fast Five” and “Bridesmaids,” which were released
in April and May 2011, Roberts said. The unit, which is
Comcast’s second-largest division by annual sales behind its
cable arm, reported  revenue  of $5.18 billion and operating
income of $747 million in last year’s second quarter.  “Battleship,” released on May 18, cost $209 million to
make and has generated $282 million in worldwide ticket sales,
according to Box Office Mojo. “The Five-Year Engagement,”
released on April 27, cost $30 million and has taken in $32.7
million.  “Fast Five,” with $125 million in production costs,
generated $626.1 million in sales. “Bridesmaids,” a $32.5
million film, took in $288.4 million, according to Mojo.  Comcast, based in Philadelphia, fell 1 percent to $28.63 at
the close in New York trading. The shares have gained 21 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
