As Maria das Gracas Silva Foster
took over as chief executive officer at  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR) ,
she couldn’t help giving a shout-out to two forces that have
shaped her life.  The first went to Petrobras, the world’s biggest deep-water
oil producer, on whose Rio de Janeiro stage she was standing on
Feb. 13 to be sworn in as CEO, Bloomberg Markets magazine
reports in its July issue. The second was to her mother, who
decades ago encouraged a work ethic that propelled her young
daughter from a poor neighborhood to the pinnacle of her
profession.  “The badge and I have been together for more than 30
years,” Foster told several hundred employees as departing CEO
Jose Sergio Gabrielli handed her a symbolic Petrobras ID card.
“I thank my mother, Terezinha, for the power of her
transforming love.”  Foster, a 58-year-old engineer who favors pantsuits and
has two small stars tattooed on her wrist, is leading  Latin
America’s biggest company  by market value just as  Brazil ’s
economy cools.  During a decade-long boom, at least 30 million Brazilians
have emerged from poverty, and the country now has at least
100,000 millionaires. In 2011, though, growth slowed to 2.7
percent from an annual average of 4.6 percent in the previous
four years.  Self-Sufficient  Brazil is counting on Petrobras to provide national energy
self-sufficiency that will meet the demands of a growing
economy. The company, which is 51 percent  controlled  by the
government, produces 91 percent of Brazil’s oil and 90 percent
of its natural gas.  It’s struggling to increase output and develop reserves
after new offshore wells have failed to compensate for faster-
than-expected declines at older fields. That imbalance is
putting Petrobras behind in reaching its 2020 target of 6.4
million barrels of oil equivalent a day, up from the current 2.6
million.  Petrobras will account for about 40 percent of the 922
billion reais ($456 billion) in energy and infrastructure
spending in Brazil from 2010 to 2015, even as the country
splurges on airports and stadiums for the 2014  World Cup  and
2016 Olympics.  ‘Tremendously Important’  “Oil and gas are an increasingly important sector of the
economy and will only grow in size and import,” says  Christopher Garman , an analyst who covers  Latin America  at Eurasia Group in
New York. “The capacity of Petrobras to deliver is tremendously
important.”  Investors are betting that Foster, an engineer who has
spent 31 years immersed in Petrobras -- from its drilling
platforms to its management suites -- is the right person for
the job. Petrobras stock, hit by the slowing output growth,
jumped 3.8 percent on Jan. 23 when she was named the company’s
first female CEO -- the biggest increase in eight months.  Nick Robinson , a portfolio manager at Aberdeen Asset
Management in  Sao Paulo , says Foster is a skilled technical
manager who can tackle glitches that have forced unscheduled
shutdowns at drilling sites.  Delays in platform construction and increased outages to
perform maintenance began surfacing during Gabrielli’s tenure.
The former CEO, an economist and academic, focused more on
finances than on day-to-day operations as he shepherded
Petrobras’s $70 billion  share offering  in September 2010, the
world’s biggest.  Attractive Bonds  Today, public shareholders own 49 percent of the company’s
voting stock. Petrobras shares have dropped 29 percent since the
share offering through May 31.  Luz Padilla, who helps manage $1 billion of emerging-market
debt, including Petrobras, at Doubleline Capital LP in  Los
Angeles , is bullish on the company.  “It’s an industry that could reshape the profile of Brazil,
given the potential of their finds,’’ she says. Padilla says
Petrobras bonds are attractive compared with such global peers
as BP Plc because they have a lower price and higher yield,
paying more interest.  Foster is pushing Petrobras to cut through bottlenecks. In
May, she created a management position to oversee the purchase
and installation of platforms, rigs and pipelines. The division
will try to head off cost overruns and construction setbacks at
local yards that have slowed progress at a company with 80,000
employees and 244 billion reais in annual revenue.  “Someone like her, who is perhaps more of an operational
person, could be a huge asset,” says Robinson, whose firm held
5.8 million Petrobras shares on Feb. 29.  Detail-Oriented  Manuel Fernandes, head of  KPMG  International’s oil and gas
division in Rio, met Foster when she ran Petrobras’s natural gas
business and KPMG was its auditor. He says she knows the nitty-
gritty of the company and the industry.  “You wouldn’t expect someone in her position to look into
too many details, but she does,” he says. “That’s how she is.”  Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff  is another fan. The two,
now among the world’s most powerful female leaders, began
working together in 2003. Rousseff was energy minister under
President  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva . Foster, who holds a degree
in chemical engineering from the Fluminense Federal University
in Niteroi, in  Rio de Janeiro  state, was Rousseff’s secretary
for oil, natural gas and renewable fuels.  ‘Good Hands’  Foster returned to Petrobras in 2005, while Rousseff served
as its chairman from 2003 through 2010. Like Rousseff, Foster is
a member of the governing Workers’ Party, which has close ties
to unions. The party’s jobs programs and subsidies for poor
households have helped vault millions into the middle class.  “With Graca at the helm, Petrobras will be in good hands,”
Rousseff said at the February event, using Foster’s nickname. “I
know the work capacity, competence and seriousness with which
Graca dedicates herself, not only to this company but also to
everything she does in her professional life.”  For investors, Foster’s first order of business is to boost
 output , which rose 1.5 percent last year, to an average 2.6
million barrels per day of oil equivalent. It was the slowest
pace since 2007 and well below the company’s 7.7 percent target.  The new CEO is stymied by rules enacted under Lula.
Petrobras must buy as much as 70 percent of its equipment -- from
giant offshore platforms to polyester rope for anchors -- from
domestic suppliers.  Local Rules  The former president set the local-content regulations to
aid Brazil’s oil services industry and reduce reliance on
imports. In December, Petrobras canceled a plan to lease 21
drilling rigs after offers by local suppliers proved too
expensive. One bidder, Sete Brasil Participacoes SA, is a
shipbuilder that Petrobras and the Brazilian  Development Bank 
formed to construct the platforms.  In an effort to control  inflation , which reached 5.2
percent in March, the government also caps how much Petrobras
can charge for gasoline. The price of fuel in early May was 4.38
reais per gallon at the refinery gate, a 21 percent discount
from international markets, according to estimates by Banco
Bradesco SA.  Brazilian motorists pay more at the pump than U.S. drivers
do because of taxes. With domestic prices low, Petrobras loses
money on every liter of imported gasoline and diesel it sells in
Brazil.  Foster must guide the company through some of the world’s
most challenging petroleum-engineering feats. She knows the
territory, having been the first woman at Petrobras to board an
oil platform in the Atlantic Ocean to install drilling
equipment.  Drilling Deep  As of March, 90 percent of Petrobras’s  oil production  in
Brazil came from offshore fields, most from wells at depths of
more than 300 meters (980 feet). With these wells aging,
Petrobras is betting on so-called pre-salt fields -- regions as
deep as 7,000 meters and as far as 300 kilometers (186 miles)
from land.  Rough seas, tricky geology and the distance workers must
travel make drilling more complex than in the Campos Basin off
southeastern Brazil, where Petrobras gained most of its
expertise.  Petrobras will be going it alone with these deep wells. A
law passed in 2010 requires the company to be the sole operator
of new pre-salt developments. Foreign  oil companies  can only
take stakes, not run the sites.  “That’s a problem,” says  Scott Black , president of Delphi
Management Inc., an investment management firm in  Boston . He
says Petrobras is a good investment that would be even more
attractive if Brazil’s oil industry were a free market. “Free
enterprise might do better long term,” he says.  Chevron Spill  Foster is also navigating the environmental hazards of
drilling in deep waters. Chevron Corp., the second-biggest U.S.
oil company, spilled 3,000 barrels in November at the Frade
Field, where Petrobras is a partner. It was Brazil’s eighth-
most-productive area until Chevron suspended drilling.  Prosecutors are going after Chevron with three lawsuits
seeking a total of 40 billion reais in damages, and lawmakers
have demanded investigations into the incident. Petrobras said
in a March 30  filing  with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission that it’s liable for 30 percent of any payments for
the spill.  Petrobras foresees as much as $527 million in possible
losses from other environmental claims. Among these are a July
2000 spill at the President Getulio Vargas Refinery in
Araucaria, Parana state, and payouts to fishermen for a spill in
Rio that same year, the company said in the filing.  Jobs Machine  Ultimately, Foster, with guidance from Rousseff’s
government, will have to decide whether to run Petrobras as a
state-owned, job-creating bureaucracy or a modern public
company. Today, the government names seven members of the 10-
person board, and shareholders lack any real power.  Petrobras workers say the company must tilt toward local
industries and the interests of Brazil.  “Petrobras can’t produce oil according to what’s needed by
others,” says Silvio Sinedino, who represents employees on the
company’s board. “It can’t be a company that’s concerned about
revenue for the sake of revenue.”  Jim Crandell, an analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co. in  New York 
who leads coverage of oil services providers, says ignoring
market realities can hurt Petrobras.  “The goal of Brazil seems to be to provide employment to
its citizens,” he says. “Brazil may find that it has to pay more
for equipment and services going forward. There certainly is the
risk of material delays.”  ‘Net Exporter’  Should Foster overcome Petrobras’s drilling hurdles,
appease shareholders, satisfy employees and boost output as
planned, Brazil may go from being almost self-sufficient in oil
to becoming a big source for the U.S. and other consumers.
President  Barack Obama  said during a 2011 visit that he wants
the country to be a major U.S. supplier.  “If Petrobras doesn’t help Brazil by increasing production
growth, there’s a serious chance Brazil moves back into an oil-
importing situation and loses its status as a self-sufficient
producer,” says analyst Gustavo Gattass at Banco BTG Pactual SA
in Rio.  T.J. Conway, a research and advisory manager at New York-
based Energy Intelligence Group, says Petrobras must strike a
balance between local demands and exporting.  “Brazil can definitely be a contributor to global markets
and an important player, and perhaps eclipse the rest of the
region in terms of being a net exporter,” he says.  Dubbed ‘Caveirao’  Foster, whom colleagues have dubbed “Caveirao” in a
reference to the armored vehicles police deploy in crime-ridden
neighborhoods, is used to plowing through roadblocks.  Her mother raised young Graca and her sister, Rita, in
Rio’s Morro do Adeus, a poor neighborhood that eventually
deteriorated into a shantytown. Her mother worked. Her father
was an alcoholic, Foster told Bloomberg News last year. Graca
collected cans and paper for pocket money until the family moved
in with an aunt in Niteroi.  Foster graduated from Fluminense Federal University in
1978, going on to earn a master’s degree in nuclear engineering
from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and a Master of
Business Administration from the Rio-based Getulio Vargas
Foundation. She joined Petrobras’s exploration and production
division as an intern in 1979.  Corporate Ladder  Two years later, she boarded an offshore oil platform to
install equipment, going on to manage the drilling division. She
became the first woman to run Petrobras’s field engineering,
taking over the distribution unit and the chemical and
petrochemical division, Petroquisa.  In September 2007, Gabrielli named her Petrobras’s first
female director, the second-highest management level, when she
took charge at the gas and energy division. Today, of about
12,200 engineers at Petrobras, about 1,400 are women.  Foster married and had a daughter. She then divorced,
remarried and had a son. Her second marriage stirred controversy
after Brazilian newspapers reported that husband Colin Foster
owned an engineering company that had supplied Petrobras with
equipment from 2007 to 2010.  Petrobras  responded  in 2010, saying the division Foster
headed didn’t do business with Colin Foster’s company, according
to Petrobras’s website.  Foster, wearing a pink suit with a satin blouse at
headquarters the year before she was named CEO, said she had to
be 100 percent available for her job.  “I have two children,” she said in the January 2011
interview in a 23rd-floor office with a view of Guanabara Bay.
“I gave up a lot for my career, but I’m very happy for it. I’ve
done what I’ve always thought was best for me and my family.”  ‘Above Expectations’  Foster expects similar dedication from her employees. She
says she wants her staff to work one day a week -- joking that
the day starts on Monday and ends on Saturday.  “I once called one of my managers, and he answered while he
was bathing his two children,” she recalls. “While he spoke, he
dropped the cell phone in the tub, picked it up and continued
talking.”  Marcio Mello, CEO of Brazilian oil explorer HRT
Participacoes em Petroleo SA, worked with Foster for 18 years.
He recalls their time at the research division, Cenpes, which
develops technology to explore the pre-salt region.  “She’s the kind of person you give a mission to and she
delivers above expectations,” Mello says, showing a framed photo
of himself with Foster in 1999, when they received a research
award for their work at Cenpes. “This is why Graca will do a
fantastic job at Petrobras. She’s fair, a hard worker, focused;
she has targets; she’s a performer. My dream is to have a person
like Graca at HRT.”  Oil Women  Foster isn’t the only woman leading Brazil’s energy effort.
There’s also Magda Chambriard, who, like Foster, rose through
Petrobras. She heads Brazil’s oil regulator, ANP.  “Brazil is in a unique moment,” Mello says. “Now we have two
ladies, not only with huge experience but huge knowledge.”  Chambriard’s job at the regulator ends years of the plum
political appointment going to people with little oil
experience.  Foster’s promotion at Petrobras may mean continued
government meddling, Delphi’s Black says.  “They’ve got probably the best drilling profile of any of
the national oil companies,” he says of Petrobras. “They’ve got
expansive fields off the coast. The problem is, the government
keeps upping the ante.”  ‘Slightly Aggressive’  Black points to the controls on gasoline as one way the
government hurts the company. Publicly traded competitors
benefited as  oil prices  rose 8.3 percent during the fourth
quarter. Petrobras lost by operating as an arm of the government
instead of competing in a free market. Fourth-quarter net income
dropped to 5.05 billion reais, 52 percent less than a year
earlier.  Foster may be willing to challenge Rousseff on gasoline
prices. Petrobras’s budget for 2012 estimated oil at about $90 a
barrel. With oil above $110, she told an April conference
organized by the Brazilian Oil, Gas and Biofuel Institute that
prices may have to be adjusted.  “The very fact that she’s brought this argument to the
forefront and is being slightly aggressive means the government
is being tested,” Aberdeen’s Robinson says. “There’d be a pretty
clear signal that they are going to use Petrobras as a tool of
economic policy rather than let it be run for the benefit of
minority shareholders if they don’t allow the company to
increase prices.”  Effort Ahead  At the same time, employees are demanding that Foster look
after them. Board member Sinedino, an engineer in the seismic
department, says Petrobras must improve worker safety. He
expects Foster to remain an ally.  “She is one of us,” he says. “She has spent her life at the
company, has worked everywhere; she knows exactly what’s going
on and what needs to be done.”  Foster, in her acceptance speech, acknowledged the effort
ahead.  “Taking over the company is a big challenge, bigger than
the combination of all those challenges I faced till I reached
this day,” she said.  Then she touched her heart in a gesture to her Petrobras
colleagues. “I owe the moment to you all,” she said.  “Finally, I thank the Lord for this moment, my children for
accepting me as I am, and my mother, Dona Terezinha.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
