Tax breaks for companies that keep
older workers while hiring young ones will be discussed with
union and business leaders in July and be ready for a parliament
vote by year-end, Labor Minister Michel Sapin said.  French President  Francois Hollande  promised 500,000 so-
called “generational contracts” during his campaign.  Sapin said details of the measures will decided during a
“social conference” next month. He said they are intended to
apply to workers under 25 and over 55, and would involve
foregoing between 2 billion euros and 3 billion euros ($2.5
billion to $3.8 billion) of social charges a year. The cost
would be covered by ending other tax breaks. The measures will
be negotiated industry by industry, he said.  “If they are too rigid they won’t be applicable to all
companies, and if too flexible they won’t be effective,” Sapin
said after a visit with Hollande to the headquarters of Groupe
Supratec, a closely held provider of industrial services, in
suburban Paris. After the visit, Hollande said the labor
situation in  France  is “worrying.”  The French Labor Ministry this week reported its 12th
monthly rise in jobless claims. The number of people actively
looking for work rose 4,300, or 0.1 percent, in April to
2,888,800.  To contact the reporter on this story:
