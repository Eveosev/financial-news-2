Five people, including Chief Equity
Strategist Masatoshi Kikuchi, have left  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s
Merrill Lynch & Co. unit in  Tokyo , according to a person
familiar with the matter.  Quantitative strategist Hayato Nagayoshi, head of Japan
research Yohei Osade, head of domestic Japan equity sales
Shusuke Nakata, and director of yen equity sales Takao Inoue
also resigned from the equity division, according to the person,
who declined to be named because the information is not public.  Tsukasa Noda, a Tokyo-based spokesman for the bank,
declined to comment. Kikuchi, Nagayoshi and Osade were not
immediately available when called by telephone. E-mails to
Nakata and Inoue were not immediately returned.  The departures come as Chief Executive Officer  Brian T.
Moynihan  aims to trim as much as $8 billion in expenses through
steps including 30,000 job cuts in retail and support
operations.  “Kikuchi was the poster strategist,” said Koji Toda,
chief  fund manager  at Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo. “He was a
popular and brilliant man, and we used to receive his reports so
I’m surprised at his resignation.”  Kikuchi joined the bank in 2000. He was ranked No. 1 by
Institutional Investor magazine’s 2012 survey and by the Nikkei
Veritas newspaper’s Japanese strategist rankings. Bank of
America Merrill Lynch was ranked second for 2012 overall Japan
research by Institutional Investor.  To contact the reporters on this story:
