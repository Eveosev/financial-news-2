New Democracy ,  Greece ’s largest pro-
bailout party, retained its lead over Syriza, which is opposed
to implementing Greece’s international rescue program, according
to a poll of their support in the June 17 elections.  Of 1,012 people questioned by Kapa Research SA for the
Athens-based Ta Nea newspaper, 26.1 percent said they would vote
for New Democracy, 23.6 percent for Syriza and 9.9 percent for
the socialist Pasok party, which also backs the  bailout .  The results showed New Democracy improving its support to
26.1 percent from 25.8 percent in the last poll done by the
company, on May 23 and May 24, following inconclusive May 6
elections. Syriza’s support rose from the 20.1 percent it scored
in that poll.  Pasok lost voters, with support falling from the 13 percent
it had in the previous poll. On the basis of the figures, a
coalition between New Democracy and Pasok could gain a slim
majority in Parliament. No party has enough support to govern
alone.  Almost seven in 10 people, or 69.5 percent, said they
wanted the country to remain in the euro area, even if that
meant implementing the austerity measures agreed on in return
for the international bailout, the poll showed. Some 19.6
percent said the country should abandon the euro if required to
implement the measures, a drop from the 24.4 percent who backed
that statement in the previous poll.  Kapa’s poll was conducted May 29 to May 31. The overall
margin of error is 3.1 percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
