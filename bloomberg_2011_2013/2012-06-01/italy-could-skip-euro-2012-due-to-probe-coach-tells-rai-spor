Italy  could skip the European soccer
championship for the good of the game amid a probe into alleged
match fixing in the nation’s soccer leagues, Coach Cesare Prandelli suggested in an interview on Rai Sport television.  “If they said that the national team mustn’t go to the
European championship for the good of soccer, it wouldn’t be a
problem,” Rai Sport cited Prandelli as saying in Zurich today.
“I’m against crusades,” he said, adding that he’d rather
“speak only of soccer, though what is happening forces me to do
otherwise.”  His comments came after prosecutors in Cremona announced on
May 28 the arrest of Lazio’s team captain as part of a match-
fixing probe for which both Juventus coach Antonio Conte and
Italian national-team defender Domenico Criscito were being
investigated. Criscito was later dropped from Italy’s team for
the European championships, which begin in Poland and  Ukraine 
next week. Italy meets  Spain  on June 10 in its first match.  Prime Minister Mario Montisaid this week that he sometimes
wished Italy’s soccer league were banned for a few years over
repeated cases of corruption, match fixing and fan violence. He
said his comments weren’t an actual government proposal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
