Japanese Finance Minister  Jun Azumi 
pledged to take “decisive” action on currencies after the yen
climbed to its highest level since February against the dollar.  “We will continue to carefully monitor  currency market 
moves with more caution,” Azumi told reporters in Tokyo today.
“If these excessive moves continue, I think I must take
decisive action” on the yen, he said.  The finance chief said it was “regrettable” that
developments in  Europe  were weighing on  Japanese stock prices 
and those movements didn’t reflect the strength of the world’s
third-largest economy. His pledge to take “decisive” action
was stronger than remarks he made yesterday, when he said he was
watching movements in the foreign-currency market.  “It’s obvious that the recent one-sided moves don’t
reflect the fundamentals of the Japanese economy,” Azumi said.
Group of Seven members “have repeatedly confirmed that
excessive currency moves are undesirable.”  The yen traded at 78.55 per dollar as of 9 a.m. in  Tokyo ,
after touching 78.21 yesterday, the highest since Feb. 15. It
has strengthened against all its 16 major counterparts this
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
