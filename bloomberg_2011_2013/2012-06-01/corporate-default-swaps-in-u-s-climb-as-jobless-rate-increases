A gauge of corporate credit risk rose
for the third consecutive day as American employers in May added
the smallest number of workers in a year and the  unemployment
rate  unexpectedly increased.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, climbed 3.2 basis points to a mid-price of
126.5 basis points at 5:28 p.m. in  New York , according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. This week, the gauge has increased 9.1,
the biggest advance since a 14.8 rise for the period ended May
18.  The measure surged after payrolls climbed by 69,000 last
month, less than the most-pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey, after a revised 77,000 gain in April that was
smaller than initially estimated, Labor Department figures
showed today in  Washington . The  jobless rate  rose to 8.2 percent
from 8.1 percent, while hours worked declined.  The swaps gauge typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit swaps pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
