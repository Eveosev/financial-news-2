Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  passed  Apple (AAPL)  Inc. in
U.S. online-movie revenue last year, fueled by booming demand
for streaming-video subscriptions, research firm IHS said.  The  Los Gatos , California-based company’s share of U.S.
consumer online-movie sales jumped to about 45 percent last
year, IHS said today in a report. Apple saw its share fell to 32
percent from about 61 percent.  Netflix split its Internet-streaming service from its DVD-
rental plan last year, making it easier to track revenue from
online users. It charges customers $7.99 a month to watch
unlimited movies and TV shows, which are delivered instantly.
Apple’s iTunes, in contrast, charges for programs individually.  Netflix used to offer its streaming and DVD mail-order
services together for $9.99. When the company split the package
into two $7.99 options, the move irked some customers and led to
cancellations and slower growth. Still, the streaming part of
the industry is poised to more than double to $1.1 billion this
year, Englewood, Colorado-based IHS predicted.  Prospects for movies purchased one at a time -- as is the
case with iTunes -- aren’t as strong, the firm said. That market
grew 2.4 percent last year to $236 million, IHS found.  Netflix’s stock declined less than 1 percent to $62.95 at
the close in  New York . Shares of Cupertino, California-based
Apple dropped 2.9 percent to $560.99.  To contact the reporter on this story:
