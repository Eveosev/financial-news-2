Walgreen Co. (WAG)  and  Express Scripts  Inc.
agreed to dismiss all claims in a contract dispute that started
last year and was sent to arbitration.  “The parties have agreed to dismiss their respective
claims, and no other action has been or will be taken by either
party with respect to this case,” Walgreen said in a Business
Wire statement that was confirmed by the company. “These
dismissals have no impact on the parties’ ability or inability
to come to terms on a pharmacy agreement.”  Brian Henry , a spokesman for Express Scripts, declined to
comment beyond the Walgreen statement.  In the lawsuit, which was filed by Express Scripts in
September, the St. Louis-based pharmacy benefits manager accused
the drugstore chain of distributing “a wave of marketing and
promotional materials which disparage Express Scripts and
falsely state that, after Dec. 31, 2011, Walgreen will be unable
to fill prescriptions for Express Scripts members.”  Express Scripts manages pharmacy benefit programs for
private employers, unions and government health plans. Walgreen,
based in Deerfield, Illinois, is the largest U.S. drugstore
chain.  The case is  Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX)  v. Walgreen Co., 1:11-cv-
06223, U.S. District court, Northern District of Illinois
(Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
