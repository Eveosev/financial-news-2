U.S. options volume rose 5.1 percent
in May from the same month in 2011 as more than 377.5 million
contracts traded, the Options Industry Council said today.  About 1.76 billion contracts traded in the first five
months of the year, a 4.7 percent decrease from the same period
in 2011, Chicago-based OIC said. Average daily volume for the
month was 17.2 million, up 0.3 percent.  Trading of options on stocks and exchange-traded funds
amounted to 346.1 million contracts during the month, or 3
percent more than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
