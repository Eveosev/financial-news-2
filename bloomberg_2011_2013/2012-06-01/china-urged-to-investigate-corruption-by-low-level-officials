China  needs to pay more attention to
low-level government corruption, the chief of the Communist
Party’s discipline department wrote, according to the state-run
People’s Daily.  The government should seriously investigate the “buying
and selling of official posts,” bribery for votes, arbitrary
school fees and the use of “evil forces as protection
umbrellas,” He Guoqiang wrote in an article to be published
today in the party magazine “Seeking Truth,” People’s Daily
reported.  China’s Communist Party is seeking to crack down on
corruption ahead of this year’s once-a-decade leadership
transition. The ouster of Politburo member  Bo Xilai , after his
wife was taken into custody on murder charges, spurred official
statements that his case was an aberration and not
representative of larger problems within the party.  Other problem areas include land acquisitions, sales of
pharmaceutical products, fake drugs and food, and the
encroachment of state assets at state-owned enterprises, He
wrote, according to People’s Daily.  In March, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said in a speech that the
government could lose its grip on power unless it imposes
stronger measures to fight corruption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
