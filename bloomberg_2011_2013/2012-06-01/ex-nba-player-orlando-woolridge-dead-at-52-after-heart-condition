Former  National Basketball
Association  forward Orlando Woolridge died at his parents’ home
in Mansfield, Louisiana, yesterday, the coroner’s office said.
He was 52.  Woolridge had been under hospice care “for a couple of
weeks” due to a chronic heart condition, Desoto Parish Deputy
Coroner Billy Locke said in a telephone interview.  Woolridge played 13 seasons with seven teams after being
drafted No. 6 out of the University of Notre Dame by the Chicago
Bulls in 1981 and averaged 16 points and 4.3 rebounds a game for
his career. He was suspended during the 1987-88 NBA season for
substance abuse.  Woolridge also played for the New Jersey Nets, Los Angeles
Lakers,  Denver Nuggets ,  Detroit Pistons , Milwaukee Bucks and
Philadelphia 76ers. He went on to coach in the Women’s NBA and
the  American Basketball Association. (ABKB)  He was inducted into the
Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 2010.  In March, the 6-foot-9 Woolridge was arrested on charges of
stealing aluminum tubing from a drill site in Louisiana. He was
charged with theft of more than $1,500, according to Patrick
Cobbs, chief deputy of the Desoto Parish Sheriff’s Office in
Mansfield, Louisiana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
