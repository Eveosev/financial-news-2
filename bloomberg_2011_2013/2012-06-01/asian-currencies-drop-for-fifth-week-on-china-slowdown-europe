Asian currencies fell for a fifth
week, the longest losing streak since June 2009, after economic
reports in the U.S. and  China  added to global slowdown signs and
Europe’s debt crisis escalated.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index slid 0.6 percent,
capping a 2.6 percent slump since April 27, as  India ’s rupee
sank to an all-time low and  Taiwan ’s dollar completed the
biggest weekly loss since September. Manufacturing in China grew
last month at the slowest pace this year, trailing 26 of 27
estimates in a Bloomberg survey, according to an index published
by the statistics bureau and logistics federation yesterday.  “The manufacturing data has surprised even when
expectations have been lowered, especially with weak new orders
and import trends,” said Irene Cheung, a Singapore-based
currency strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group.
“Market sentiment is very poor and the Europe situation remains
dire.”  Malaysia’s ringgit fell 1.8 percent this week to 3.2100 per
dollar in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
India’s rupee slumped 0.4 percent to 55.5850, Taiwan’s dollar
slid 0.9 percent to NT$29.931 and Thailand’s baht lost 0.7
percent to 31.90. China’s  yuan  declined 0.4 percent to 6.3690,
its biggest drop since January.  The Chinese manufacturing report followed data May 31 that
showed more Americans applied for jobless benefits in the week
ended May 26 and private employment climbed 133,000 in May,
compared with the median estimate of 150,000 in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Stock Outflows  A global slowdown and speculation  Greece  will exit the 17-
nation euro wiped $4.5 trillion in  market value  from global
stocks in May. Global funds pulled $7.3 billion from equities in
South Korea and Taiwan last month, exchange data show.
Foreigners also sold $825 million more Indonesian shares than
they bought and took $470 million out of Thai stocks.  “There is concern about the export outlook with some
slowdown not only in  Europe  but also in China,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a Bangkok-based trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp.  The Asia Dollar Index touched 113.74 May 31, the lowest
level since September 2010. The rupee lost 6 percent in May and
touched a record-low of 56.515 per dollar May 31, when the
government reported economic growth of 5.3 percent for the last
quarter, the slowest expansion in nine years.  Philippine Growth  Indonesia ’s rupiah fell 0.6 percent to 9,528 per dollar
this week in Jakarta, after reaching 9,643 May 31 that marked
the lowest level since October 2009. Offshore investors cut
government debt holdings by 4.3 trillion rupiah ($452 million)
in May, according to finance ministry data on May 30.  The Philippine peso strengthened 0.8 percent this week to
43.393 per dollar. Moody’s Investors Service raised the nation’s
credit rating outlook to positive on May 29 and data showed May
31 that the economy grew 6.4 percent in the three months through
March, faster than the 4.3 percent expansion forecast in a
Bloomberg survey.  Elsewhere,  South Korea ’s won gained 0.7 percent to 1,177.83
per dollar and Vietnam’s dong fell 0.1 percent to 20,870.  To contact the reporters on this story:
