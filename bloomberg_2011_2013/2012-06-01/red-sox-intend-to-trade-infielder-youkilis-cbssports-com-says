The  Boston Red Sox  have told other
Major League Baseball teams they intend to trade infielder Kevin Youkilis, CBSSports.com reported.  The website, without citing the source of its information,
said Red Sox officials have told opponents that they would like
to trade for a pitcher.  Red Sox General Manager  Ben Cherington  called the report
“inaccurate.”  “We haven’t told any teams we plan to trade him,”
Cherington wrote in an e-mail to Boston radio station WEEI,
according to the station’s website.  Youkilis, 33, has been in 27 games this season while
rotating playing time with Adrian Gonzalez and Will
Middlebrooks. He has a .250 batting average with four home runs
and 12 runs batted in. Youkilis won the  World Series  with Boston
in 2004 and 2007 and has spent his entire nine-year major league
career with the team.  Boston is in last place in the American League East with a
26-25 record, three games behind division leaders Tampa Bay and
Baltimore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
