ArcelorMittal (MT)  may continue cutting
back on steel production and shifting it to still-profitable
sites into 2013 as the outlook on demand remains uncertain, Le
Figaro said today, citing sector analysts.  Arcelorâ€™s site at Florange, France, will remain idle
through the second half of 2012 without closing down entirely,
Figaro said, citing a labor leader at the plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
