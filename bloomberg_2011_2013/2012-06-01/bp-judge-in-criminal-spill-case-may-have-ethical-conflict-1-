The federal judge in  New Orleans 
overseeing the first criminal prosecution stemming from the  BP
Plc (BP/)  Gulf of Mexico  oil spill  asked lawyers in the case to weigh
in on whether he has a conflict of interest.  U.S. District Judge Stanwood Duval told lawyers at a
closed-door meeting May 31 that he owns a camp near Grand Isle,
Louisiana, the main beach where the oil spill washed ashore in
2010, according to a court filing today.  Duval also said his son works for the BP-funded trust that
is processing settlement claims for thousands of coastal
property owners, tourism and fishing interests claiming harm
from the worst offshore spill in U.S history.  Duval said in the filing that he “neither has a direct
interest in the subject matter of this criminal proceeding, nor
does he believe that his impartiality with respect to the
defendant might reasonably be questioned.”  Duval presides over the prosecution of former BP engineer
Kurt Mix, who faces two obstruction of justice charges for
allegedly destroying evidence. Mix, who worked on efforts to
kill BP’s runaway well off the  Louisiana  coast in 2010, is
accused of deleting key  text messages  from his mobile phone
after being warned to retain them.  The judge asked lawyers for the defense and the government
to file responses by June 7 to his disclosure of possible
conflicts.  The case is U.S. v. Mix, 12-cr-00171, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans).  To contact the reporter on this story:
