Russia’s Federal Property Management
Agency proposed that  OAO VTB (VTBR) , a state-run lender, consider
forming joint venture with Russian Post to work in the country’s
regions,  Kommersant  said today, citing a letter from the
agency’s acting head Gleb Nikitin.  Another state-run lender, Vnesheconombank, or VEB, was in
charge of creating a nationwide bank based on the postal
network, but froze the project recently, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
