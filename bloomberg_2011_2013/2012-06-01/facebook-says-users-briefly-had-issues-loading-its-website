Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the world’s
biggest social-networking website, said some users had trouble
for a short time yesterday accessing their accounts.  “Some users briefly experienced issues loading the site,”
Facebook said in an e-mailed statement about the outage. “The
issues have since been resolved and everyone should now have
access to Facebook. We apologize for any inconvenience.”  The issue was reported earlier today by Forbes, which said
some people started experiencing outages at 7 p.m. EDT, and
at 10 p.m. EDT “RIP Facebook” was among the top 10 trending
topics on Twitter Inc. Investors have pummeled shares of
Facebook since its  initial public offering  last month, citing
concern over growth prospects for the Menlo Park, California-
based company.  Facebook rose 5 percent to $29.60 in  New York  trading
yesterday. The company sold shares last month in the IPO at $38
apiece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
