Usain Bolt ran the fastest 100 meters
of 2012 as the world-record holder prepares to defend his
Olympic sprint title in  London .  After clocking 10.04 seconds -- his slowest time in three
years -- on May 25 in Ostrava,  Czech Republic , Bolt won in 9.76
seconds at the Diamond League meet in Rome last night.  “After Ostrava a lot of people questioned me, but I never
questioned myself,” Bolt said in comments on the International
Association of Athletics Federations website.  Only Bolt, fellow Jamaican Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay of
the U.S. have  run faster  than his winning time last night.
Powell finished second in 9.91 seconds.  Bolt, 25, who set the world record of 9.58 seconds in 2009,
is scheduled to race in a Diamond League meet in Oslo on June 7
before returning to  Jamaica  for national trials. The London
Games start July 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
