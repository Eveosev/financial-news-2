A ship hired by Morgan Stanley is
bringing liquefied natural gas to Argentina from Trinidad and
Tobago after  Repsol SA (REP)  canceled shipments following the
government’s takeover of its YPF SA unit.  The Excel will arrive in  Bahia Blanca  tomorrow, ship-
tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show. The carrier is
employed by Morgan Stanley, according to the website of its
Antwerp, Belgium-based owner,  Exmar NV. (EXM)   Repsol canceled 10 shipments of LNG to Argentina this year
because the government breached contracts following the seizure
of YPF, the country’s biggest oil producer, Madrid-based
spokesman Kristian Rix said last month. That’s causing Argentina
“to pay more than foreseen” as it competes with Asian buyers
for spare cargoes, Julio De Vido, minister of federal planning,
public investment and services, said last month.  Miguel de Potter, chief financial officer at Exmar, said
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  charters the Excel. Hugh Fraser, a London-based
spokesman for the bank, declined to comment.  Argentina will need about 80 shipments of LNG in 2012 to
meet its energy demand, 60 percent more than last year, state-
owned energy company Energia Argentina SA said in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
