Former Italian Premier  Silvio
Berlusconi  called for the Italian mint and the European Central
Bank to start printing euros to tackle the debt crisis, news
agency Ansa reported, citing his remarks to allied lawmakers.  Berlusconi, who called his proposal a “crazy idea,” also
told legislators in Rome today that it wouldn’t be the end of
the world if Italy left the euro, Ansa reported. A Berlusconi
spokesman couldn’t immediately confirm the remarks.  The former premier said Italy needed to pressure European
alllies to get the ECB to print money to jumpstart the economy.
Otherwise it will be “Ciao, ciao Europe,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
