The ruble tumbled for an eighth day
to the lowest since 2009 against the dollar, prompting
“intensive” central bank interventions as oil sank on worse-
than-expected U.S. data.  The ruble slid 0.6 percent to 33.68 per dollar by the 7
p.m. close in Moscow, taking its fall since May 18 to 7.2
percent. The ruble lost 0.6 percent to 41.65 per euro and 0.6
percent to 37.2665 against the central bank’s target basket.  Oil dropped as much as 4.6 percent after U.S. companies
added the smallest number of workers in a year and a gauge of
Chinese manufacturing missed estimates. The central bank’s
intervention levels are already “quite intensive,” Bank Rossii
Chairman Sergey Ignatiev said today in comments broadcast on
state television.  “We see further downside in the period ahead,”  Benoit Anne , head of emerging-markets strategy at Societe Generale SA
in  London , wrote in an e-mailed note.  Bank Rossii manages the ruble within a so-called “floating
corridor” against a basket of dollars and euros to limit swings
that erode exporters’ competitiveness. At current levels, the
bank may be selling $150 million to $250 million day in foreign
currencies to boost the Russian currency, according to Anne.  Intervention Risks  “We are going to watch for rising intervention risks,” he
said. “We are still far away from the level that would trigger
a much heavier intervention.”  Investors increased bets on the ruble weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the currency at 34.265 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 34.0665 per
dollar yesterday.  The ruble’s decline will probably slow even if oil
continues to fall, Ignatiev said. The currency may correct as
much as 3 percent to 32.7, according to  Denis Korshilov , head of
fixed income, currencies and commodities at Citigroup Inc. in
Moscow.  “A big Russian customer order is believed to be behind
this sharp move,” he said. The ruble “should correct to 32.5
to 32.7 soon after the order is done.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
