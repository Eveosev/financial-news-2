Finland ’s government is “unlikely”
to alter rules on miners “significantly” as it discusses
levying a possible mining tax, Economy Minister Jyri Haekaemies
told Talouselaemae.  The government, which will agree on its stance on the
mining tax “in the near future,” seeks to boost mining
investments by fostering stability and predictability,
Haekaemies said, according to the Helsinki-based business
magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
