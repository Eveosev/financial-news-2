Pace Oil and Gas Ltd.  fell as the oil
and natural-gas producer cleans up an  oil spill  from a well in
northern Alberta and begins an audit of its operations, Chief
Executive Officer Fred Woods said.  The shares dropped 5.5 percent to C$3.07 at the close in
Toronto. The stock earlier touched a record low of C$2.96.  Pace has recovered about a third of an estimated 3,500
cubic meters (22,000 barrels) of oil and water that spilled from
the well near Rainbow Lake, Alberta, Woods said today in a
telephone interview. The company has hired an external auditor
to assess its operations for similar risks, he said.  “We’ve trenched the perimeter and we’re now in the
recovery stage,” Woods said. The Calgary-based company has
about 100 people working at a camp to clean up the spill.  Pace’s production hasn’t been affected by the incident and
the company is sticking with its target of the equivalent of
14,500 to 15,250 barrels of oil a day for the full year, Woods
said.  The well near Rainbow Lake has been shut in and Pace has
hired SWAT Consulting Inc., which provides emergency spill
services, to help with clean up. The company doesn’t yet know
how much it will cost to clean up the spill, Woods said.  Alberta ’s  Energy Resources Conservation Board  is
investigating the cause of the spill, said Darin Barter, a
spokesman for the government agency, in a phone interview
yesterday. Pace doesn’t know what caused the accident, Woods
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
