Jerry Sandusky, the former assistant
football coach at  Pennsylvania State University , failed to
persuade an appeals court to delay his sex-abuse trial.  Sandusky sought the higher court’s intervention after state
court Judge John M. Cleland denied his second request to
postpone the trial. Cleland said in his ruling that while the
June 5 trial date poses some problems, no other date will
necessarily present a better alternative.  The Pennsylvania Superior Court denied Sandusky’s emergency
petition for review of Cleland’s order and denied as moot his
request to stay the proceedings, according to court documents.  Sandusky, a former defensive coordinator for  Penn State ’s
Nittany Lions, is charged with 52 criminal counts related to the
alleged abuse of 10 boys he met through a charity he founded for
needy children. Eleven of the counts are for involuntary deviate
sexual intercourse, according to court documents.  Jury selections in the case are scheduled to begin on June
5 with opening arguments slated for June 11.  The case is Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania  v. Sandusky,
CP-14-2422-2011, Court of Common Pleas, Centre County,
Pennsylvania (Bellefonte).  To contact the reporter on this story:
