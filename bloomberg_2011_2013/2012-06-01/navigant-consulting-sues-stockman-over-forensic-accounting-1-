David Stockman , the former Reagan
administration budget director, was sued by the forensic
accounting firm Navigant Consulting Inc. over claims he failed
to pay $297,000 for work done for his defense in a fraud case.  Stockman was indicted in 2007 on charges that he misled
investors in Collins & Aikman Corp. when he served as its chief
executive officer. U.S. prosecutors in  New York  dropped the case
two years later.  Navigant claims in its breach-of-contract complaint, filed
today in federal court in Manhattan, that Stockman owes the
money for work it performed on his behalf. As of May 2010, the
firm had been paid $6.75 million of the $7.05 million it was
owed, according to documents in the complaint.  Stockman didnâ€™t immediately return an e-mail seeking
comment on the lawsuit.  The case is  Navigant Consulting Inc. (NCI)  v. Stockman, 12-
cv-04321, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
