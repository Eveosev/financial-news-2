Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev 
blamed terrorists for an attack at a guard station on the border
with  China  that killed at least 15 people.  “I consider this a terrorist act,” Nazarbayev said in a
statement today posted on his website. “It probably happened as
a result of internal conflicts. But it’s still early to talk
about it. The barracks for soldiers and the house for officers
were burned down.”  Kazakhstan found two more bodies at the post today, the
Border Guard, a unit of the KNB security service, said today.
Fifteen have been confirmed as dead, including a civilian forest
ranger.  Investigators are trying to determine the cause of the
incident at the outpost in southwestern  Kazakhstan . The guards
frequently dealt with Chinese crossing the border to illegally
gather medicinal herbs, Almaty-based Kaztag reported.  Officials said yesterday that 15 guards were posted to the
station, meaning one more may be missing. The remains of the
dead will be taken to the capital Astana for genetic
identification, the KNB said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
