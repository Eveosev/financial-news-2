A severe thunderstorm warning and
tornado watch has been issued for  Washington  as a wave of
powerful storms crashes across the mid-Atlantic states.  Washington, Baltimore and parts of Virginia and  Maryland 
may be hit by winds as high as 60 miles (97 kilometers) per hour
and as much as 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain, according to
the  National Weather Service  in Sterling, Virginia.  A Maryland law enforcement officer reported a funnel cloud
near Damascus, Maryland, northwest of Washington, the agency
said. No damage was reported.  “This is a dangerous storm,” the Weather Service said.
“If you are in its path, prepare immediately for damaging wind
gusts and frequent cloud-to-ground lightning. Move indoors to a
sturdy building and stay away from windows.”  A tornado watch, meaning the storms may develop, has been
issued from  Pennsylvania  to  North Carolina  and Weather Service
radar was tracking potential twisters in Maryland and Virginia
as of 3:50 p.m. East Coast time. Washington is under a watch
until 9 p.m.  Flash flood warnings have also been issued for the
Washington-Baltimore area until midnight. Water was reported to
be halfway up car tires on the streets of Charlottesville,
Virginia, according to the Weather Service.  Large hail was reported in North Carolina and Virginia,
according to the U.S.  Storm Prediction Center  in Norman,
 Oklahoma . Buildings were damaged and trees were knocked down.  To contact the reporter on this story:
