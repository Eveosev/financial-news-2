Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) , which got about 44
percent of  revenue  last year from stores in  China , dropped the
most in more than three years after manufacturing in the Asian
nation declined for the first time in six months, signaling an
economic slowdown.  Yum, owner of KFC and Taco Bell,  fell  8 percent to $64.70
at the close in  New York , the biggest decline since Nov. 20,
2008. The shares have gained 9.6 percent this year.  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index expanded at the weakest
pace since December, falling to 50.4 from 53.3 in April, the
statistics bureau and logistics federation said in Beijing. That
compared with a median estimate of 52 in a Bloomberg survey of
27 economists. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  A slowing Chinese economy “raises real concerns about Yum
given 50 percent of its profit comes from company-owned stores
in China,” said Bryan Elliott, an analyst at Raymond James
Financial Inc. in  St. Petersburg ,  Florida . “Manufacturing is an
important part of income for consumers and an increasing amount
of that income has been going to purchase meals at KFC in
China.”  Yum plans to open 600 new restaurants in China this year.
The Louisville, Kentucky-based company’s KFC and Pizza Hut
chains have boosted  sales  in the Asian nation with delivery
service and expansion into smaller cities.  The company has about 37,300 stores worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
