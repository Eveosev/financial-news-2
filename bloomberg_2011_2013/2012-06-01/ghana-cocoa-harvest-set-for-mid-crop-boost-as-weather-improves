Ghana ’s cocoa-industry regulator
expects to reach the crop harvest target of as much as 900,000
metric tons after weather patterns “changed in favor of the
cocoa,” said Yaw Adu-Ampomah, deputy chief executive officer.  “We are quite close, the difference is not significant,”
he said in an interview yesterday in Accra, the capital,
declining to give figures.  Purchases accelerated near the end of the main-crop season,
which closed yesterday in the world’s second-biggest grower of
the chocolate ingredient, he said. The minor season will begin
later in June. “The weather will favor the light crop,” said
Adu-Ampomah.  After reaching a record of more than 1 million tons in the
2010-11 season, Ghana lowered its forecast to 850,000 tons to
900,000 tons after mid-season dry weather and strong winds
curbed harvests.  The main-crop cocoa harvest was seen as “fairly good,”
said Noah Amenyah, a spokesman for the state-owned board.  Cocoa for July delivery rose 1.5 percent to 1,471 pounds
($2,268) per ton yesterday in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
