ET Solar Group Corp, a Chinese solar
company, started work at two projects in  Germany  as it seeks to
finish the parks before a potential cut in subsidies.  The projects include a 7.6 megawatt project in Hohen
Wangelin, 150 kilometers (93 miles) north of Berlin and a 5-
megawatt plant in Ratzlingen, east of Wolfburg, the Nanjing-
based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  German solar installations in the three months to March
more than tripled to 1,800 megawatts compared to the same period
a year ago, when 513 megawatts were connected, as developers
rushed to take advantage of subsidies before they’re cut.  ET Solar, which makes solar modules and develops solar
farms, plans to finish the ground-mounted photovoltaic plants by
the end of June, according to the statement. Wattner AG, a
Cologne, Germany-based solar company, owns the projects.  “We are set to complete another sizeable volume ahead of
the potential tariff cut by June this year,” ET Solar Chief
Executive Officer Dennis She said in the statement.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  seeks to curb financial support
for solar in reaction to an installation boom. Her plan to cut
subsidies by a record starting April 1 was blocked by state
leaders in the upper house on May 11. The bill was sent to a
parliamentary panel for arbitration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
