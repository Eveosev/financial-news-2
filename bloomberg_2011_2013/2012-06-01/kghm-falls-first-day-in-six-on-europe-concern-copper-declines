KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , the copper
producer with the biggest European mine output, fell for the
first time in six days on concern the debt crisis in  Europe  is
deepening and as U.S. payrolls missed forecasts.  The shares declined 2.3 percent to 125 zloty as of 2:33
p.m. in Warsaw. Copper for three-month delivery slid 1.5 percent
to $7,314 per metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.  A gauge of manufacturing in the euro area contracted for a
10th month in May, Markit Economics said today. Unemployment in
the currency union reached a record high of 11 percent, the
European Unionâ€™s statistics office said.  Payrolls in the U.S. climbed 69,000 last month, less than
the most-pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, after
a revised 77,000 gain in April that was smaller than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
