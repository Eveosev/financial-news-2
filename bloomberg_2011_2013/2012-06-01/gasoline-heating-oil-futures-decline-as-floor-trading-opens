Gasoline slid to a five-month low as
the U.S. and European labor markets weakened and factory output
slowed in  China  and  Europe , threatening demand for fuel.  Futures sank as U.S. payrolls rose 69,000 after a revised
77,000 April gain that was smaller than initially estimated,
Labor Department figures showed. The Chinese Purchasing
Managers’ Index fell to 50.4 in May from 53.3 in April, China’s
statistics bureau and logistics federation said today. A gauge
of manufacturing in Europe fell to a three-year low.  “The  unemployment rate  didn’t help what was already an
extremely negative tone in the market,” said  Addison Armstrong ,
director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford,
 Connecticut . “Supplies are tight and demand picked up, but with
the rest of the world in free-fall it’s going to be hard to
prevent products falling as well.”  Gasoline for July delivery tumbled 6.91 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $2.6536 a gallon at 11:53 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices touched $2.6331, the lowest intraday
level since December.  Futures have dropped 1.2 percent this year after being up
as much as 27 percent through March 26.  The U.S.  jobless rate  rose to 8.2 percent from 8.1 percent,
while hours worked declined. The  Institute for Supply
Management ’s  factory index  fell to 53.5 in May from 54.8 a month
earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based group’s report showed.  European Unemployment  The  unemployment  rate in the 17-nation  euro zone  was at 11
percent in April and March, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said today. That’s the highest since the
data series started in 1995. A gauge of  manufacturing  in the
region fell to 45.1 from 45.9 in April, London-based Markit
Economics said today. That’s the lowest level since mid-2009.  “The reports are giving confirmation that even the economy
that everyone thought was doing OK, the U.S., is not OK,” said
Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management
Institute in  New York . “Everything is a mess.”  Futures’ slide was part of a broad market plunge in
commodities and equities. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) 
erased its 2012 gain. Crude oil for July delivery on the Nymex
fell as much as 4.6 percent, leading the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
index of 24 materials down 1.9 percent at 11:53 a.m. in New
York.  The broad market slide could spur a rally next week on
speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will step in with a third
round of large scale asset purchases, or QE3, to stabilize the
economy.  Negative Data  “Literally every piece of data out of the world this week
was negative,” Chirichella said. “We’re getting close to a
recession and the Fed is going to have to try and do something.
If the market believes that a QE3 is coming, you get buying
coming in.”  The Energy Department reported yesterday that gasoline
 supplies  slipped 833,000 barrels last week to 200.2 million, the
lowest level since November 2008.  Gasoline demand , measured by
deliveries to wholesalers, rose 3.5 percent to 8.93 million
barrels a day as Americans filled their tanks before the
Memorial Day holiday weekend.  July-delivery heating oil fell 6.2 cents, or 2.2 percent,
to $2.6412 a gallon, after touching $2.6213, the lowest intraday
level since Jan. 26, 2011. Prices have tumbled 10 percent this
year.  Inventories of distillates, including diesel and heating
oil, declined 1.71 million barrels, or 1.4 percent, to 117.8
million, the lowest level since June 2008. Wholesale  demand  for
distillates rose 7 percent to 3.86 million barrels a day.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide,  fell  0.9
cent to $3.611 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. It was the
lowest level since Feb. 21. Gasoline is down 8.3 percent since
reaching a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
