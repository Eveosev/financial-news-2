French soft wheat rated “good” or
“excellent” rose in the seven days ended May 29 from a week
earlier as barley and corn conditions also improved, crop
office FranceAgriMer reported.  Soft wheat with top ratings increased to 70 percent from 69
percent in the previous week, the Montreuil-sous-Bois, France-
based office reported on its  website  today. That compares with
24 percent rated “good” or “excellent” a year ago, when a
spring drought hurt the crop.  Rain in April and May aided grain in  France , the European
Union’s largest grower, after a dry start to the year. The
outlook for French soft-wheat yields was raised to 7.19 metric
tons a hectare (2.47 acres) from 7.04 tons in April on improved
conditions, the EU’s crop-forecasting unit reported this week.  The ratings are the average for eight regions representing
54 percent of French soft-wheat production, according to the
crop office. France accounted for 5.2 percent of the world wheat
harvest in 2011-12, based on International Grains Council data.  Durum  wheat rated “good” or “excellent” rose to 60
percent from 57 percent, based on three regions making up 58
percent of French production, the data show.  Winter  barley  rated “good” or “excellent” climbed 2
percentage points to 65 percent, based on crops in seven regions
that produce 56 percent of average national output. That
compares with 63 percent in the week-ago period, the data show.  For spring barley, the grain rated “good” or
“excellent” rose to 83 percent. The  ratings  are based on data
from five regions that on average grow 47 percent of the French
crop, according to FranceAgriMer.  Corn  conditions also improved, with 69 percent of the crop
getting top ratings, from 64 percent a week earlier, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
