Germany  beat Israel 2-0 in a tuneup
for soccer’s European Championship to secure its first win in
three matches this year. France defeated Serbia by the same
score and  Greece  got its first victory in five games.  Mario Gomez  and Andre Schurrle scored last night in Leipzig
as Germany, the bookmakers’ second favorite to win Euro 2012,
rebounded from losses to France and Switzerland.  Germany opens its campaign for a record-extending fourth
continental title against Portugal on June 9 in Lviv, Ukraine.
The 16-nation tournament, co-hosted by  Poland , starts June 8.  Franck Ribery and Florent Malouda scored first-half goals
in Reims to extend France’s unbeaten run to 20 games. The French
host Estonia on June 5 in their final tuneup before facing
 England  six days later in the Group D opener in Donetsk.  Midfielder Yann M’Vila injured his right ankle last night
and may be ruled out of the tournament, UEFA.com reported,
citing France team doctor Fabrice Bryand.  “The ankle is not broken. It’s reassuring,” Bryand was
cited as saying. “However, we need 48 hours more to say if he
will recover in time.”  Greece, which plays Poland in seven days in the
tournament’s opening match, needed a goal from Kyriakos
Papadopoulos to beat Armenia 1-0 in Kufstein, Austria. The
victory ended a run of three draws and a defeat for Greece, the
2004 European champion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
