Canadian natural gas fell amid
forecasts of milder-than-normal U.S. weather that may pare
demand for power-generating fuels.  July gas in  Alberta  fell 5.5 percent. Cooling demand in the
U.S. Midwest, the biggest-consuming region for Canada’s gas
exports, will trail normal by 43 percent through June 8,
according Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives. U.S.
stockpiles of gas were 35 percent above the five-year average as
of May 25, according to the Energy Department.  “The focus is all on the weather now,” said Carl Neill, a
consultant with Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta. “Storage is
going to be very full this year.”  Alberta gas for July delivery tumbled 11 cents to C$1.8825
a gigajoule ($1.71 per million British thermal units) on NGX, a
Canadian internet market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped
to users in  Canada  and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada
Corp.’s Alberta system. NGX gas is down 9.6 percent this week.  Natural gas for July delivery on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange fell 9.6 cents to settle at $2.326 per million Btu. The
futures fell 9.4 percent this week.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near  Chicago  fell
11 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $2.2332 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas declined 10.33 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $2.0585
per million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, prices were down 10.23 cents, or 4.5
percent, to $2.1632.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 17.4 billion cubic
feet, 551 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.53 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.49 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 874 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.74 billion cubic feet today, or 67 percent of its
capacity of 2.95 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.95
billion cubic feet at 2:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
