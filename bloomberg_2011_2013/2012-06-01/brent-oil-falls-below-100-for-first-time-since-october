Brent crude  tumbled below $100 a
barrel for the first time in almost eight months, reaching a
level targeted by Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, amid slowing
Chinese growth and rising U.S. unemployment.  Brent plunged to its lowest intraday level since February
2011, while in New York prices dropped to their lowest in almost
eight months, as American employers in May added the smallest
number of workers in a year, and  China ’s manufacturing grew at
the weakest pace since December. Saudi Arabian oil output
advanced to the highest level since 1989, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  “It’s a really poisonous cocktail,” said  Eugen Weinberg ,
head of commodities research at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt.
“In the oil market we have a mixture of weak demand, ample
supplies, some nervous investors and a stronger  U.S. dollar .”  Brent futures for July settlement fell as much as $4.17, or
4.1 percent, to $97.70 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange, the weakest level since Feb. 8, 2011. It traded for
$98.34 at 1:42 p.m. London time, having lost 8.4 percent this
year.  West Texas Intermediate futures for July delivery fell as
much as $3.97 to $82.56 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange, the weakest since Oct. 7, and was at $82.86 in
electronic trading at 1:48 p.m. London time. The benchmark
contract is heading for its longest losing streak in 5 1/2
years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
