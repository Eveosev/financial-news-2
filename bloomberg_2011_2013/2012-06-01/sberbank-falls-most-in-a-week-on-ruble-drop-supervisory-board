OAO Sberbank (SBRCY) ,  Russia ’s biggest
lender, fell the most in more than a week as the ruble headed
for the steepest two-week slump among global currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  Sberbank’s ordinary shares lost 3.7 percent to 78.75 rubles
by the close in Moscow, the biggest decline since May 23.  A weaker ruble encourages Russians to withdraw and convert
ruble deposits, Sberbank’s main source of funding. The ruble
sank 0.6 percent to 33.68 per dollar by the close, declining for
an eighth day.  “The ruble is upsetting everyone,” Vladimir Sergievskiy,
an analyst at Finam Investment Co., said by phone, referring to
Sberbank’s shares. “This is a sharp and unexpected drop.”  Sberbank extended losses after shareholders did not elect
Deputy Finance Minister and head of the minority shareholder
communication committee Alexei Savatyugin to the new supervisory
board.  The new 17-member board includes Ronald Freeman, who sits
on Troika Dialog’s board of directors, and Dmitry Tulin,
Sberbank said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
