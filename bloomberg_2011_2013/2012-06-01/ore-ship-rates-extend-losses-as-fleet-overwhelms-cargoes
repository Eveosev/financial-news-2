The largest commodity carriers fell
for an 11th day as the supply of vessels overwhelmed demand for
cargoes.  Daily income for Capesizes, the largest ships hauling iron
ore and coal, fell 4.4 percent to $4,814, the lowest since March
28, according to the  Baltic Exchange , the London-based publisher
of freight rates. The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a broader measure of
raw-materials shipping costs, declined 2.1 percent to 904
points.  The BDI gauge plunged 48 percent this year because of a
glut of vessels. The fleet of commodity carriers will swell 12
percent this year while demand for cargoes advances 8.7 percent,
RS Platou Markets AS, an Oslo-based investment bank, said in an
e-mailed report today.  “Overall demand in dry bulk is not bad, it’s just too many
big vessels out there,” Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst at
Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo, said in an e-mailed note today.  Panamax vessels, which carry about half as much as
Capesizes, fell 2.9 percent to $7,138 a day, figures from the
exchange show. That’s less than the two smallest ships tracked
by the index. Daily earnings for Supramaxes fell 1.1 percent to
$10,694, the lowest since April 20, and Handysizes, the smallest
ships tracked by the index, fell 1.4 percent to $9,217,
according to the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
