QGEP Participacoes SA (QGEP3)  fell to the
lowest since its initial public offering after drilling a dry
hole in an area that holds Brazil’s biggest oil fields.  QGEP plummeted 16 percent to 8.29 reais, the lowest since
it sold shares in February 2011.  QGEP and  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s state-controlled
oil company that operates the Ilha do Macuco well, will study
data and decide in the second half of the year the next steps
for the area, QGEP said in a statement today. The well cost QGEP
$70 million, Chief Executive Officer Lincoln Guardado said today
in a conference call with analysts.  Dry holes have a “very big impact” on QGEP because it
doesn’t have many exploration areas, Auro Rozenbaum, an analyst
at  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , said in a telephone interview from Sao
Paulo today.  The well is located in Brazil’s so-called pre-salt region
in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean where Brazil has found more
oil than any other country in the past decade. QGEP has a 30
percent stake in the block and Petrobras owns the rest.  Petrobras dropped 1.7 percent to 18.80 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
