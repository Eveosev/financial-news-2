Telkom SA Ltd. (TKG)  said South Africa’s
Cabinet won’t support a plan to sell a 20 percent stake in
Africa’s biggest fixed-line operator to  KT Corp. (030200)  of  South Korea .  Details of the proposed transaction were presented to
Cabinet on May 30 and Communications Minister Dina Pule told
Telkom yesterday that a decision was taken not to back it, the
Pretoria-based company said in a statement today. The government
directly  owns 39.8 percent  of Telkom and state-controlled
pension fund Public Investment Corp. holds 10.9 percent.  KT, South Korea’s biggest phone and Internet provider, on
May 8 offered to pay 25.60 rand a share, or about 2.68 billion
rand ($315 million), for the stake, 29 percent below an Oct. 14
offer of 36.06 rand a share. The transaction may dilute the
government’s holding in Telkom to below 50 percent as it would
require the issue of new shares to KT.  Telkom’s board “will be engaging with the Honourable
Minister of Communications to discuss Cabinet’s decision and the
implications thereof,” the company said.  Shares in Telkom have declined 29 percent to 22.91 rand
since the companies first announced they were in talks, compared
with a 7.5 percent gain in the benchmark FTSE/JSE  Africa  All
Share index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
