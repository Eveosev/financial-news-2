Commodities extended their decline,
falling to the lowest level in almost eight months, after U.S.
employers created fewer jobs than economists estimated and
Chinese manufacturing slowed.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index fell 2.6 percent to
580.99 in New York, the lowest settlement since Oct. 4. The
index declined 6.4 percent this week, a fifth straight drop and
the biggest since September. Wheat, heating oil, cotton and
gasoline led the losses.  U.S. payrolls climbed by 69,000 last month, below the most
pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, Labor
Department figures showed today in  Washington .  China ’s
Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 50.4 in May from 53.3 in
April, China’s statistics bureau and logistics federation said
today in Beijing.  Euro area  and U.K. manufacturing contracted.  “The U.S. payroll numbers were significantly weaker than
expected and the PMI out of China and the U.K. were terrible as
well,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics
LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy consultant. “We’re getting
very weak data going into June and the markets don’t like it.
Economies are slowing and demand will fall.”  Commodities also dropped after a report showed unemployment
in the euro area reached 11 percent in April and March, the
highest since the data series started in 1995. The  European debt
crisis  that began in  Greece  has spread to Ireland,  Portugal ,
 Italy  and  Spain , curbing economic growth and demand for fuel.  Crude Oil  Crude oil  for July delivery fell $3.30, or 3.8 percent, to
$83.23 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest

biggest slide since December 2008.  Brent oil for July settlement slipped $3.44, or 3.4
percent, to $98.43 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in  London . It was the lowest close since Jan. 27, 2011. Brent is
down 8.3 percent this year.  Natural gas for July delivery dropped 9.6 cents, or 4
percent, to settle at $2.326 per million British thermal units
on the Nymex. Futures, which dropped to a 10-year intraday low
of $1.902 on April 19, are down 22 percent this year.  Copper fell in  New York , capping the longest streak of
weekly declines in two years. Copper futures for July delivery
retreated 1.5 percent to $3.3135 a pound on the Comex, the
lowest settlement price this year.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped 0.9 percent to $7,361 a metric ton ($3.34 a
pound). Aluminum, tin, lead and nickel also declined in London.
Zinc rose.  Wheat Tumbles  Wheat slid, capping the biggest weekly loss in more than 14
months, on speculation that global supplies will be ample as the
harvest in the U.S. progresses and rains ease dry conditions
from  Russia  to  Kansas . Wheat for July delivery dropped 4.9
percent to end the session at $6.1225 a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Futures fell 10 percent this week.  Cotton futures fell on concern that a sluggish global
economy will erode demand. Cotton for December delivery slid 3.9
percent to close at 67.61 cents on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Orange-juice futures for July delivery slipped 0.3 percent to
$1.117 a pound in New York.  Gold and silver led the commodities moving higher. Gold
rose the most since Sept. 27 on speculation that the  Federal
Reserve  will take steps to stimulate growth. Gold futures for
August delivery jumped 3.7 percent to settle at $1,622.10 an
ounce on the Comex in New York. It was the biggest gain for a
most-active contract since Aug. 8.  Silver for July delivery rose 2.7 percent to $28.512 an
