Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
rallied this week on speculation inflation will slow and the
central bank will cut  interest rates . The dong was steady.
      Consumer-price gains  eased to 8.34 percent in May from a
year earlier, the least since August 2010, official data show.
The repurchase rate will be reduced to 10 percent by the end of
June and to 8 percent by the end of the third quarter from the
current 11 percent, according to a research note released today
from HSBC Holdings Plc.  “For the rest of the year, we expect inflation to stay in
the single digits,” Trinh D. Nguyen, a Hong Kong-based
economist at HSBC Holdings, wrote in the note.  The five-year bond  yield  fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 9.61 percent this week, according to a
daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. It was little
changed today.  The dong was steady this week and today at 20,870 per
dollar as of 3:54 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at
20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
