Switzerland ’s government-owned export
risk insurer has almost reached the 130 million-franc ($133
million) limit on exposure to Greece set by its risk managers,
according to a spokeswoman for the agency.  SERV has 123 million francs of Greek coverage, Sonja Kohler
Mueller, a spokesman for the Zurich-based insurer. The exposure
limit is regularly monitored, and was last set at the beginning
of April.  “If the conditions don’t change, we usually don’t reset an
exposure limit,” Kohler Mueller said. SERV may consider
increasing the limit in special cases and under certain
conditions if Swiss exporters applied for additional coverage,
she said. The premium rates SERV charges for Greece are the
highest in  Europe , she added. The Swiss federal agency insures
national exporters against non-payment in sectors like
mechanical engineering, power distribution and chemicals.  Germany’s  Euler Hermes (ELE)  and OeKB Versicherung AG, an
Austrian credit insurer, have stopped offering new coverage of
shipments to Greece in recent days as the country has become
more risky.  Greeks vote again June 17 after elections on May 6 failed
to produce a workable majority in parliament, as parties opposed
to sticking to Greece’s part of an aid agreement with the
European Union won most of the votes.  SERV’s total exposure as of March 31 was 8.3 billion
francs, Kohler Mueller said.  Russia ,  Saudi Arabia (SABIC)  and China were
the top three destinations last year for Swiss export support,
according to SERV’s annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
