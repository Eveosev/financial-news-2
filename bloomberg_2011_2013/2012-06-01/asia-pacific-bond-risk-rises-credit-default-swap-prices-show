The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index climbed 1.5 basis points
to 202.5 basis points as of 10:42 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  The gauge is set for its highest close
since Nov. 29, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan advanced 3 basis points to 200 as of
8:40 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The index is headed for its highest close since May 23,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index increased 4 basis points to
196 basis points as of 9:39 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The gauge is on track for its highest close since
May 25, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
