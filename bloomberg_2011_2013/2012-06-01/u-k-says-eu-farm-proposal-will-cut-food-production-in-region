European Union proposals to tie
farmers’ payments to environmental targets threaten to cut food
output and countries should be able to let farmers tailor land
management to local circumstances, a U.K. committee said.  The EU has called for 30 percent of direct payments to be
tied to farmers’ compliance with environmental targets as part
of the reform of the bloc’s Common Agriculture Policy. Under the
proposed rules, farmers would have to reserve at least 7 percent
of their land for ecological measures such as trees and fallow
land. Farmers should be able to tailor their land management
practices to local circumstances, Parliament’s Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs Committee said today in a  statement .  EU plans “will reduce  food security  by taking land out of
production and are likely to impact badly on our environment,”
Anne McIntosh, who chairs the Parliament committee, said in the
statement on the government’s website. “It’s a nonsense to
think that farmers from  Finland  to Sicily should be tied to the
same narrow prescriptive rules.”  Hedges, ditches and field margins may be included in areas
farmers will be asked to reserve, so the measures “should have
no impact or in some cases a limited impact on production,”
 Roger Waite , a spokesman for the European Commission, said in an
e-mailed statement. Some existing environmental plans already in
place in some member countries may allow farmers to fully or
partially apply to “greening” requirements, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
