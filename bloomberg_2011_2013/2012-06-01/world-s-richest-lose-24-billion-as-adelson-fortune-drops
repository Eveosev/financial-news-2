The world’s richest people lost a
combined $24.4 billion this week as concerns over Spain’s rising
borrowing costs and the sputtering American job market caused
global markets to tumble.  Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson lost $2.2 billion. Shares of
his Nevada-based  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)  fell 10.3 percent during
the week. On Friday, Macau casinos reported gambling revenue
rose 7.3 percent in May, its slowest pace since July 2009.
Adelson, 78, is the 22nd richest person in the world, according
to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index .  “We seem to be bogged down in a very sluggish pattern,”
John Carey, who helps oversee about $220 billion at Pioneer
Investments in Boston, said in a telephone interview on June 1.
“The jobs report was discouraging, and it’s been discouraging
the past several weeks. It reaffirms this fear that the economy
is slowing.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average erased its 2012 gain after
U.S. employers created the fewest jobs in a year and Chinese
manufacturing slowed. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index sank 2.46
percent on June 1, to close at 1278.04 in New York, its biggest
drop since November.  Yields on 10-year treasuries dropped below 1.50 percent for
the first time ever Friday as U.S. payrolls climbed by 69,000,
less than the most-pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey, and Chinese manufacturing grew at its weakest pace since
December.  Mark Zuckerberg , 28, fell off the Bloomberg index. Shares
of Menlo Park, California-based  Facebook Inc. (FB) , the world’s
largest social-networking company, dropped 13.1 percent during
the week. He is worth $14.1 billion.  Slim, Batista  Mexico’s  Carlos Slim , 72, remains the world’s richest
person with a net worth of $63 billion. The tycoon lost $3.1
billion during the week, as shares of his Mexico City-based
telecommunications company America Movil SAB fell 3.04 percent.
Bill Gates, 56, ranks second with a net worth of $58.2 billion.  Eike Batista’s fortune fell 8.1 percent to $24.9 billion.
Brazil’s richest man, 55, hired  Banco Bradesco (BBDC4)  BBI SA to sell a
stake in his AUX gold business after dropping plans for an
initial public offering. EBX Group Co., Batista’s Rio de
Janeiro-based holding company, decided a stake sale to investors
would be more profitable than an IPO.  Batista is the 12th richest person in the world.  Hong Kong’s  Li Ka-Shing  ranks 18th on the index with a net
worth of $20.9 billion. On May 25, the 83-year-old billionaire
said he would offer financial support to his younger son,
Richard, to expand beyond the family’s  Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (1)   Four days later, the Wall Street Journal reported Richard
Li is a prospective bidder for  ING Groep NV (INGA) ’s Asia life-
insurance unit, citing unidentified people familiar with the
situation.  The Bloomberg Billionaires Index takes measure of the
world’s wealthiest people based on market and economic changes
and Bloomberg News reporting. Each net worth figure is updated
