Treasuries rallied, pushing 30-year
bond yields to a record low, after the economy added fewer jobs
in May than economists forecast, indicating the worsening
European sovereign-debt crisis may restrain U.S. growth.  U.S. 10-year note yields  dropped below  1.5 percent for the
first time after the Labor Department reported that U.S.
employers added 69,000 jobs in May after an increase of 77,000
the previous month. The difference between the yields on the 10-
year and 30-year securities narrowed to almost the least since
January on reduced concern inflation will erode the value of
fixed-income assets.  “We are on the edge of a more serious slowdown than what
was otherwise anticipated coming into the data,” said
 Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $1.9 billion as chief
investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union in New
York. “On top of the European issues, the further decline in
growth here and in other parts of the world are manifesting
safe-haven buying.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  fell 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 1.45 percent at 4:59 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Traders prices. The 1.75 percent
security maturing in May 2022 gained 31/32, or $9.69 per $1,000
face amount, to 102 3/4. The yield reached an all-time low for a
third day, touching as low as 1.4387 percent.  Thirty-year bond yields declined 12 basis points to 2.52
percent, reaching as low as 2.5089 percent, below the record
2.5090 percent on Dec. 18, 2008, according to  Federal Reserve
figures  beginning in 1953.  Important Levels  “There was supposed to be resistance at 1.50 percent, but
with a lousy employment report, it didn’t amount to much,” said
FTN Financial Chief Economist Christopher Low, the most accurate
forecaster of Treasury note yields in 2011. Resistance is an
area on a chart where pre-established orders may be clustered.  “People have been saying 1.25 percent, but the trading
over the next few days will determine if 1.25 percent is
realistic,” said Low who was the only one among 70 analysts in
a Bloomberg News survey who predicted the yield would fall to 2
percent by the end of last year.  The gap between 10-year and 30-year securities narrowed to
108 basis points, close to the least since January. It closed at
107 basis points on May 21 after widening to a 2012 high of 120
basis points on May 1. The difference between the yield on the
two-year and 10-year notes, dropped to 121 basis points, the
least since June 2008.  “It’s a recalibration of growth expectations, as well as a
pullback of global inflationary pressures,” said  Ian Lyngen , a
government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut .  Global Bonds  As U.S. 10-year note yields drop to record lows, they are
still yielding more than benchmark bond markets around the
world, boosting demand for the securities. Yields on the 10-year
note are 16 basis points  higher  than the average for comparable
debt of nations from  Germany  to  Australia , above the average of
12 basis points in the past year, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Treasuries had their best performance last month since
August, returning 1.8 percent, reflecting the declining
stability of the 17-member euro currency amid a worsening
sovereign debt crisis, according to indexes compiled by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch. The MSCI All-Country World Index of
 shares  slid 8.9 percent in the same period. The euro declined
6.6 percent versus the dollar in May, the most since September.  U.S. 10-year yields are down from 5.3 percent in June 2007,
before the financial crisis intensified, and below the average
of 4.96 percent during the past 20 years.  Value Measure  Valuation measures show Treasuries are at the most
expensive levels ever. The term premium, a model created by
economists at the Fed, touched negative 0.96 percent, the most
expensive level ever. A negative reading indicates investors are
willing to accept yields below what’s considered fair value.  The U.S. central bank sold $8.6 billion of Treasuries due
from September 2012 to April 2013 today, according to the Fed
Bank of  New York ’s website. The sales are part of its program to
replace $400 billion of shorter-term debt in its holdings with
longer maturities by the end of this month to support the
economy by keeping down borrowing costs.  The probability of more central bank policy action is 80
percent, up from 50 percent, after the jobs report, according to
Morgan Stanley.  Investors have stepped up speculation that any add stimulus
would focus on home-loan bonds after Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  sent a study to Congress in January that highlighted
how housing is restraining the economic recovery.  Mortgage Bonds  Fannie Mae ’s 3 percent securities gained 0.17 cent on the
dollar more than a basket of Treasuries of similar duration
today, the most since May 17, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The debt trailed U.S. government notes in five of the
previous six sessions.  The yield on the securities, which most affect home-loan
rates because they’re priced closest to face value among
actively traded debt, declined eight basis points to a record
low 2.51 percent. All government-backed mortgage notes
underperformed Treasuries by 64 basis points last month, the
most since August, Barclays Plc index data show.  China ’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index fell to 50.4 last month
from 53.3 in April, the statistics bureau and logistics
federation said in Beijing. A separate gauge from HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics showed a seventh straight contraction,
the longest since the global financial crisis.  Economic Perspective  “Given the outlook for the global economy and the U.S., it
looks like we’re joining Asia and  Europe  for a slowing of the
economy,” said Gary Pollack, who helps manage $12 billion as
head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank AG’s Private
Wealth Management unit in New York. “We could go to lower
levels in yields.”  The median forecast of 85 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey before today’s jobs report, was for an increase of
150,000 jobs. The  unemployment rate  rose to 8.2 percent, the
Labor Department said.  Gross domestic product climbed at a 1.9 percent annual rate
from January through March, down from a 2.2 percent prior
estimate, revised Commerce Department figures showed yesterday
in  Washington . The report also showed corporate profits rose at
the slowest pace in more than three years and smaller wage gains
at the end of 2011.  Germany’s  two-year note yield  slid to as low as minus 0.12
percent, the first time the rate on the securities has been
negative. U.K. 10-year gilt yields fell to a record 1.493
percent.  Spain’s Debt  Spain’s Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said the country
was in a “very difficult situation.”  “I don’t know if we’re on the edge of the precipice, but
we’re in a very, very, very difficult situation,” de Guindos
said in Sitges,  Spain , late yesterday. Spain and  Italy  are where
the “battle for the euro” is being fought, he said. The
jobless rate in the 17-nation  euro zone  was at 11 percent in
April and March, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said today.  The difference in yields between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, which represents
traders’ expectations for the rate of inflation during the life
of the bonds, fell to 2.02 percentage points, almost the lowest
since January. It touched a 2012 low of 1.9 percentage points on
Jan. 3 and a high of 2.45 percentage points on March 20.  Inflation Measure  A  measure  of price-increase predictions used by the Fed to
set policy, the five-year, five-year forward break-even rate,
which gauges the average inflation rate between 2017 and 2022,
was 2.5 percent on May 29, down from a 2012 high of 2.78 percent
on March 19. The rate slid nine basis points in April, the
biggest monthly decline since December.  “In the U.S. we have an aggressive central bank, which has
widely telegraphed that if there’s a slowing in growth they will
act,” said  Priya Misra , head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in New York, one of the 21 primary dealers
that trade with the Fed. “That’s what to me provides a floor in
rates, not so much in real rates, but in break-evens.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
