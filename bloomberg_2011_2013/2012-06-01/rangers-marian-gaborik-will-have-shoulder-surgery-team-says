New York Rangers  forward  Marian Gaborik  will have surgery to repair a torn labrum in his
shoulder, the National Hockey League team said.  Gaborik, 30, who was third in the NHL with 41 goals during
the regular season, will have the procedure June 6 in New York,
Rangers General Manager Glen Sather said today in a statement.
The team didn’t estimate how long Gaborik would be out.  “Last two months I played with injury, it was not easy,”
Gaborik told the Slovakian newspaper SME this week while in his
hometown of Trencin, Slovakia. “The medication and injections
reduced the pain, but I did not have the strength that I
needed.”  Gaborik told the newspaper he expects to be sidelined for
five or six months.  After registering 76 points during the regular season,
Gaborik was limited to one goal in  New York ’s loss to New Jersey
in the Eastern Conference Finals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
