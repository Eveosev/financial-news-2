The largest  oil tankers  will earn
more than previously estimated this year as stockpiling to make
up for any possible loss of Iranian exports boosts revenue and
distances, according to RS Platou Markets AS.  Daily income for supertankers hauling 2 million barrels
will average $25,000 a day this year, up from a previous
forecast of $13,000, the Oslo-based investment bank said in a
report today. The total tanker fleet will expand 6.6 percent
while demand grows 7.9 percent, Platou estimates.  Importers rushed to replace supplies from  Iran  and build
inventories in case of a disruption in the  Middle East , Ole- Rikard Hammer, head of research at RS Platou Economic Research,
said in the report. Rates may decline in the second half this
year as new ships join the fleet and oil producers cut output.  “2012 is turning out to be better than feared for the
tanker market,” Hammer said in the report. “We attribute this
development to the combination of extraordinary supply fears in
the oil market at a time of relatively low inventories. We still
see 2014 as the most likely year for a return to balanced
conditions and a profitable market.”  World oil production rose 2.9 percent from a year ago and
ships carried cargoes 5 percent farther in the first quarter,
according to the report.  Returns for supertankers on the benchmark voyage to  Japan 
from  Saudi Arabia  rose 4.3 percent today to $16,809, snapping an
eight-day losing streak, according to the  Baltic Exchange , the
London-based publisher of freight rates. A 2.5 percent decline
in ship fuel, owners’ largest expense, to $621.58 a metric ton
outweighed  charter costs  sliding less than 1 percent to 49.13
industry-standard Worldscale points, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Oil Cargoes  The Worldscale system is a method for pricing oil cargoes
on thousands of trade routes. Each individual voyage’s flat
rate, expressed in dollars a ton, is set once a year. Today’s
level means VLCC hire costs on the benchmark route are 49.13
percent of the nominal Worldscale rate for that voyage.  The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, a broader measure of oil-
shipping costs that includes vessels smaller than VLCCs, fell
1.1 percent to 699 points, the lowest since Sept. 30, exchange
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
