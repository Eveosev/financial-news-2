CCX Carvao da Colombia SA , the coal
unit of Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista, slumped more than 10
percent today as investors flee pre-operational companies amid a
worsening crisis in Europe.  Shares (CCXC3)  of Rio de Janeiro-based CCX, which started trading
May 25, dropped 9.1 percent to 5.40 reais at 2:04 p.m. in Sao
Paulo after falling as much as 12 percent to its lowest level on
record. A close at this level would mean the stock would have
lost 37 percent in its first week of trading, more than doubling
the 15 percent decline of the Brazilian benchmark Bovespa Index.  CCX, which  plans to invest  $5.5 billion to develop a coal
mine, a railway and a port project in Colombia to begin
production in 2017, was spun off from Batista’s power-
generating unit  MPX Energia SA (MPXE3)  before the listing. Investors in
Brazil are more reluctant to buy pre-operational companies amid
a worsening scenario in Europe,  Pedro Galdi , equity strategist
at brokerage firm SLW Corretora in Sao Paulo, said.  “Eike Batista’s companies are still junior and they gained
a speculative profile so when they gain, it is more than the
index and the same when they fall,” he said in a telephone
interview.  MPX  declined  0.4 percent to 34.50 reais today to the lowest
since May 24.  To contact the reporters on this story:
