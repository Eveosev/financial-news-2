A Palestinian militant from the  Gaza
Strip  cut through a border security fence and slipped into
 Israel , sparking an exchange of fire in which he and an Israeli
soldier were killed, officials said.  The Palestinian Islamic Jihad organization claimed
responsibility for the attack early today in an e-mailed
statement, saying its gunman had sought to kidnap an Israeli
soldier. Palestinians later fired two rockets into Israel and
the Israeli  Air Force  struck a vehicle in southern Gaza,
wounding four Palestinians, according to an Israeli army
statement and Adham Abu Selmeya, a spokesman for the Hamas-run
emergency services department.  The Palestinian gunman was spotted as he cut his way
through the fence from Gaza into Israel when soldiers opened
fire, the army said in an e-mailed statement. The army said in a
separate statement that the airstrike was aimed at a squad of
Palestinians that had fired at Israeli soldiers.  Palestinians militants have said they would seek to capture
another Israeli soldier after the release last October of Gilad Shalit, who was held hostage for five years by Hamas after being
abducted from his tank on the Gaza border. Israel freed more
than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Shalit.  Hamas, which rules Gaza, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad,
are considered terrorist organizations by Israel, the U.S. and
the European Union.  To contact the reporters on this story:
