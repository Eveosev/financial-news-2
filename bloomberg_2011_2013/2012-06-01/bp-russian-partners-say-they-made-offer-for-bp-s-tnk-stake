BP’s billionaire partners in TNK-BP,
 Russia ’s third-largest oil producer, made an indicative proposal
about a month ago to buy the U.K. company’s 50 percent holding.  Alfa-Access-Renova, the group that represents BP’s
partners, “sent indicative terms for a deal, which are still on
the table for discussion,” said  Stan Polovets , AAR’s chief
executive officer.  BP and the billionaires’ relationship deteriorated last
year as the U.K. explorer sought to forge an alliance with
Russia’s biggest oil producer, state-run OAO Rosneft. AAR said
the deal infringed on TNK-BP’s right to pursue new opportunities
in Russia for BP. The fraught partnership no longer meets the
shareholders’ interests, billionaire  Mikhail Fridman  said
yesterday, after stepping down as TNK-BP CEO earlier this week.  BP said today it’s received expressions of interest in its
TNK-BP stake and may pursue a sale. David Nicholas, a BP
spokesman, declined to comment on who bid.  TNK-BP’s traded unit slumped as much as 11 percent to 69.52
rubles, the lowest since the shares started trading on the Micex
stock exchange. The BP and AAR venture holds more than 96
percent of the listed entity.  “Investors are afraid that the potential buyer is a state
company, which may threaten the dividend yield story,” Dmitry
Loukashov, an oil and gas analyst at VTB Capital, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
