Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Honda (7267)  Motor
Co. led five of the six largest automakers in reporting U.S.
sales gains in May that trailed estimates as slumping job growth
limited their rebound from last year’s earthquake and tsunami.  Toyota deliveries last month surged 87 percent to 202,973
and Honda sales climbed 48 percent to 133,997, according to
company statements. The Japan-based automakers, rebounding from
the natural disasters that curtailed production and slashed
inventories, missed analysts’ estimates for gains of 93 percent
and 53 percent, respectively.  General Motors Co. (GM) , Chrysler Group
LLC and Nissan Motor Co. sales also trailed estimates.  U.S. light-vehicle sales ran at a 13.8 million seasonally
adjusted annualized  rate , according to an e-mailed statement by
Autodata Corp. The pace missed the 14.4 million average estimate
of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg and slid below 14 million
for the first time this year. Employers in May added the fewest
workers in a year, according to the Labor Department.  “There’s a fairly consistent story that the U.S. recovery
is slogging it out, inching forward but still restrained,”  Paul Ballew , chief economist at Dun & Bradstreet in Short Hills, New
Jersey, said in a phone interview yesterday. “That’s what shows
up in auto sales,  consumer spending  and employment growth. While
we want the recovery to sprint ahead, it’s just the messiest one
in history because of housing, fiscal-policy issues and Europe
being on its back.”  GM deliveries last month rose 11 percent to 245,256,
according to a statement. Chrysler’s sales climbed 30 percent to
150,041, and Nissan’s increased 21 percent to 91,794. Analysts
estimated gains of 15 percent by GM, 40 percent by Chrysler, and
29 percent by Nissan.  Incentive Offers  Ford Motor Co., the only major automaker whose sales gain
exceeded estimates, boosted incentives in May. Chrysler offered
some buyers no monthly payments for 90 days and GM discounted
some models to try to offset market-share recovery by Japanese
automakers,  Peter Nesvold , a New York-based analyst for
Jefferies & Co., said in a May 31 research note.  “We’re a little bit disappointed that some of the
incentive offers didn’t drive sales a little bit beyond what
they did,” Alec Gutierrez, an analyst for Kelley Blue Book in
 Irvine , California, said in a phone interview.  Ford (F)  deliveries last month rose 13 percent to 215,699 cars
and light trucks, according to a  statement . The Dearborn,
Michigan-based automaker beat the 12 percent gain that was the
average estimate of 10 analysts. Sales of the Mustang sports car
surged 58 percent to 10,427, helped by deliveries to fleets.  Model Rebates  GM offered “substantial” increases in rebates for pickups
and sport-utility vehicles, while Ford boosted discounts on
models such as Fiesta and Focus cars, Escape SUVs and large F-
Series pickups, Jefferies’s Nesvold wrote. Chrysler’s national
promotion offering some buyers to skip three monthly payments
ran during the last 10 days of May.  Manufacturing employment accounted for 12,000 of the 69,000
new workers added last month, according to the Labor Department.
 Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  has drawn almost 20,000 applicants for 877
openings at its Montgomery, Alabama, factory that is adding
Sonata and Elantra sedan output later this year,  Robert Burns , a
company spokesman, said in an e-mail.  The U.S. jobs report “is very disappointing,” Sue Yingzi
Su, a senior economist for GM, said yesterday on a conference
call. A “softer patch” for payrolls may continue into next
month as “payback” from strength in the job market from
January through February, she said.  GM fell 0.9 percent to $22.01 at the close in New York.
Ford dropped 4.2 percent to $10.12. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  erased its 2012 gain, falling 2.2 percent yesterday.  Pension Buyouts  GM briefly erased its decline for the day after saying it
aims to cut its pension obligation by almost a fifth by offering
lump-sum payments to about 42,000 salaried retirees and shifting
plans to a Prudential Financial Inc. unit. The moves will
eliminate about $26 billion from GM’s pension obligations, which
totaled $134 billion at the end of 2011.  Total light-vehicle deliveries in May rose 26 percent to
1.33 million, missing nine analysts’ average estimate for a 31
percent increase. The May 2011 industry sales rate was 11.7
million, according to  Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-based Autodata.  Chrysler, ranked fourth in U.S. light-vehicle sales this
year, began production in May of the Dodge Dart compact and
starts shipping the car to dealers this month. Deliveries of the
Caliber, which Dart replaces, fell 66 percent to 1,341.  ‘Fully Back’  “The Japanese competitors are now back fully in the
marketplace,”  Sergio Marchionne , chief executive officer of
Auburn Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler and its majority owner
 Fiat SpA (F) , told reporters on May 24. “It’s something that we
have not had to deal with, effectively, over the last 12
months.”  GM said deliveries of the Cruze compact, which benefited
from tight supply of Toyota’s Corolla and Honda’s Civic a year
ago, slipped 14 percent to 19,613. The Detroit-based automaker
shuffled its sales team on May 17, naming Alan Batey to the new
position of vice president of U.S. sales and service. GM’s U.S.-
leading market share through May slipped 2 percentage points
from a year earlier to 17.8 percent, according to Autodata.  “There has been, I would say, some modestly renewed
aggressiveness” on pricing and incentives as Japan-based
automakers’ supply improves,  Don Johnson , GM’s U.S. vice
president of sales operations, said yesterday on the company’s
conference call. “We still expect for the industry to maintain
some pretty good discipline.”  Ford Incentives  Ford raised incentives by about $100 per vehicle in May
from April, said  Erich Merkle , the company’s sales analyst. Most
of the increase came from bigger discounts on the outgoing 2012
Escape SUV, which is being replaced by an redesigned version now
arriving in showrooms, said  Ken Czubay , Ford’s U.S. sales chief.
Escape sales still slid 0.3 percent to 23,077.  Toyota, No. 3 in U.S. vehicle sales, led the industry with
its gain, reported in a statement on its website. The Toyota
City, Japan-based carmaker said that sales of a new Camry sedan
more than doubled to 39,571 and its Prius line of hybrids more
than tripled to 21,477. Toyota lost market share in May 2011,
two months after Japan’s tsunami disrupted vehicle output and
led to shortages through much of last year.  Honda, based in Tokyo, entered May having reported year-
over-year sales declines in 10 of the last 12 months, as the
tsunami and Thai floods later in 2011 sapped supply of Civic
compacts, Accord sedans and CR-V SUVs. Civic deliveries surged
83 percent to 33,490, Accord gained 75 percent to 29,737 and CR-
V increased 54 percent to 25,186.  Nissan, which began production this month of its revamped
Altima sedan, said deliveries of the model fell 11 percent to
22,690.  Month’s Cadence  “It was a really anemic first half of the month,” said  Al Castignetti , vice president of U.S. sales for Yokohama, Japan-
based Nissan. “The second half of the month really made it for
us.”  South Korea’s Hyundai and  Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  combined to sell
11 percent more vehicles than a year earlier, trailing the 17
percent average of six analysts’ estimates. Hyundai’s deliveries
slipped 5.6 percent for Elantra small cars and 8.7 percent for
Sonata midsize sedans, while sales of Kia Sorento SUVs declined
7.2 percent.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  increased combined sales of its namesake and
Audi brand vehicles by 24 percent in May, missing the 33 percent
average of four analysts’ estimates. Deliveries of the compact
Jetta model dropped 9 percent to 15,175.  To contact the reporter on this story:
