Koza Altin Isletmeleri AS (KOZAL) , a Turkish
gold miner, and  Goldas Kuyumculuk (GOLDS)  Sanayi AS, a jewelry producer,
climbed after figures showed national exports of precious metals
soared last month.  Koza Altin added 7 percent to 33.70 liras at the close in
Istanbul, the biggest gain since at least February 2010. Goldas
rose 1.9 percent to 54 kurus.  The $1.5 billion increase in gold, jewelry and precious
metal exports in April was mostly driven by Iran, which bought
$1.2 billion worth of precious metals and jewelry in the month
from Turkey, according to figures released yesterday by the
state statistics agency.  Turkey exported $282 million worth of gold and precious
metals in April last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
