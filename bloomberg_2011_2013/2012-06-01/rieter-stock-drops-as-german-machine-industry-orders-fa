Rieter Holding AG (RIEN) , a Swiss maker of
textile machinery, fell to an eight-month low after the release
of figures showing the German machinery industry’s orders
declined for a sixth month in April.  Rieter  dropped  as much as 7.3 percent to 128 Swiss francs,
the lowest price since Sept. 3, and was trading down 5.7 percent
at 4:10 p.m. in Zurich. The decline pushed the stock down 3.7
percent this year. Competitor OC Oerlikon Corp declined 2.3
percent to 7.92 francs.  Orders for German machinery, adjusted for inflation, fell
11 percent from a year earlier in April, according to data from
the Frankfurt-based VDMA industry association. Domestic sales
contracts dropped 14 percent, while export orders declined 9
percent.  Germany  is the largest national export market for
 Switzerland ’s machinery industry, Volkan Goecmen, a Zurich-based
analyst at Helvea, wrote in a note to investors.  “Most of the Swiss machinery stocks have a high
correlation to industrial data coming out of Germany,” Oliver Girakhou, an analyst in Zurich at Credit Agricole Cheuvreux,
said by phone. Rieter is a very cyclical company which is
sensitive to macro-economic developments, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
