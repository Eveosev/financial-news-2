Asian  stocks  fell after reports on
China’s manufacturing and the  U.S. economy  missed estimates, and
as Spain denied it is in talks about a bailout as its bond
yields approach a level that prompted rescues in other nations.  Sony Corp. (6758) , a Japanese exporter of consumer electronics
that gets 37 percent of its sales in the U.S. and Europe, fell
3.5 percent in Tokyo. Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., the
country’s third-biggest lender by market value, declined 1.3
percent in Hong Kong.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s No. 1
mining company and oil producer, lost 0.8 percent in Sydney
after metal and crude prices dropped.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 1.2 percent to 111.27 as
of 8:03 p.m. in Tokyo, with more than three stocks falling for
each that rose. The gauge is headed for its lowest close since
Dec. 20. It’s poised for a 0.4 percent drop for the week, its
fifth straight week of declines and the longest losing streak
since June 2011.  “Everyone is taking a wait-and-see approach, waiting for
the outcome of the  euro zone ,” said  Pauline Dan , Hong Kong-
based chief investment officer at Samsung Asset Management Co.,
which manages $100 billion. The most bearish factor is the
possibility of the “euro zone crumbling, pulling global
economies into recession.” If China’s “economy continues to
decelerate, that would be a risk. For long-term investors,
valuation is very decent right now, so if you have an investment
horizon beyond one year it’s definitely a good time to pick up
stocks.”  Monthly Loss  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index tumbled 10 percent in May, the
biggest monthly loss since October 2008, when global markets
tumbled in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brother Holdings
Inc. The Standard and Poor’s 500 Index fell 6.3 percent for the
month, while Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 6.8 percent. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark were valued at 11.5 times estimated earnings
on average through yesterday, compared with 12.5 times for the
 S&P 500  and 9.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose 0.1 percent, while China’s
Shanghai Composite Index advanced 0.1 percent. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 0.3 percent and South Korea’s Kospi
Index slid 0.5 percent.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.2 percent. The
Topix Index fell 1.5 percent to complete a ninth week of
declines, it’s longest such streak since 1975.  Utilities dropped after the nation’s government proposed to
spin off power networks to increase competition. The proposal
may reduce electricity prices and attract more participants in a
market that’s been monopolized by regional utilities.  Shikoku Electric Power Co. dropped 5.9 percent to 1,732
yen, while  Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503) , which supplies the Osaka
region, declined 4.5 percent to 1,083 yen.  Spain Debt  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 1.2 percent
today. The index fell 0.2 percent in New York yesterday, when
data showed the U.S. economy grew more slowly in the first
quarter than previously estimated and business activity expanded
in May at the weakest pace since September 2009. The number of
Americans applying for  unemployment benefits  rose. A Labor
Department report due today is projected to show nonfarm
payrolls gained by 150,000 workers in May while the  unemployment
rate  held at 8.1 percent.  The  International Monetary Fund  said it is not preparing
financial aid for Spain and the country denied it is in talks
about a bailout. The nation’s 10-year debt yields were 6.56
percent, near the 7 percent level that prompted bailouts in
Greece, Ireland and Portugal.  Sony fell 3.5 percent to 1,013 yen, while  Billabong
International Ltd. (BBG) , a surfwear company that counts the Americas
as its biggest market, retreated 3.4 percent to A$1.855 in
Sydney.  China Manufacturing  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index, a measure of
manufacturing, expanded at a slower pace for the first time in
six months, falling to 50.4 points in May from 53.3 in April,
China’s statistics bureau and logistics federation said today.
It’s the weakest reading since December and compares with the 52
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 27 economists. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion. A separate gauge from HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed a seventh straight
contraction.  Agricultural Bank slumped 1.3 percent to HK$3.10 in Hong
Kong, while  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a Japanese construction machinery
maker that gets about 12 percent of sales from China, slumped
4.3 percent to 1,798 yen.  “The global economy, centered in the U.S. and China, is
facing stronger headwinds than expected, and recovery
expectations are tapering off a bit,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a
Tokyo-based senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management
Co., which oversees the equivalent of $70 billion.  Commodities Drop  Oil and metal shares declined after crude for July delivery
fell 1.5 percent in New York yesterday, while the London Metal
Exchange Index of prices for six industrial metals including
copper and aluminum lost 0.7 percent.  BHP declined 0.8 percent to A$31.73 in Sydney. Aluminum
Corp. of China Ltd., the nation’s No. 1 supplier of the light
metal, slid 4.5 percent to HK$3.21  DeNA Co. (2432) , a Japanese social media site operator, slumped
9.4 percent to 1,482 yen. The company’s rating was cut to
neutral from buy at Ichiyoshi Research Institute Inc. citing
possible slowdown in its earnings after Japan’s regulator said
it plans to ban one of the sales methods used by online social-
gaming operators in the country.  Gree Inc. (3632) , a Japanese social networking site, tumbled 10
percent to 1,126 yen. DeNA and Gree had the  biggest declines  in
the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index. (MXAP)   To contact the reporters on this story:
