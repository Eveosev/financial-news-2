The U.S. Mint’s  sales  of American
Eagle gold coins in May more than doubled from April as prices
of the precious metal declined.  Sales were 53,000 ounces, compared with 20,000 ounces in
April and 62,500 ounces in March, according to the Mint’s
website. Sales of American eagle silver coins rose 89 percent in
May to 2.88 million ounces from April.  In May, the benchmark gold price fell for the fourth
straight month, the longest slump since 2000, as the dollar
rallied on the escalating debt crisis in  Europe . Silver dropped
for three consecutive months.  “People are slowly coming back to gold and silver as
prices have fallen,” Scott Carter, the chief executive officer
at Los Angeles-based Lear Capital, said in a telephone
interview. “The fear trade is bringing some investors to
gold.”  Gold futures for August delivery surged 3.2 percent to
$1,614.70 an ounce at 12:31 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
heading for the biggest gain for a most-active contract since
Sept. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
