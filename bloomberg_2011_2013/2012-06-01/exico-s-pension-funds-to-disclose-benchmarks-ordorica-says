Mexico ’s pension funds will have to
disclose more details about their investment strategies,
including listing a benchmark, under rules taking effect in
August, the industry’s top regulator said.  “We’re asking that they clearly define their investment
policy in their prospectuses -- what my investment philosophy is
and what my benchmark is going to be,” Pedro Ordorica,
president of the pension fund regulatory agency known as Consar,
said in an interview today at a conference in Cancun.  The changes go into effect on Aug. 24 and the new
information will have to be published on the pension funds’
websites, according to Ordorica. It will also appear on the
Consar website after Sept. 1, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
