Emerging-market stocks fell, sending
the benchmark index to the lowest level since December, after
data showed manufacturing growth in China and India decelerated
and U.S. employers added the fewest workers in a year.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  slid 1.4 percent to 893.86
at the close in New York this week. The gauge dropped 12 percent
last month, its worst May performance since a 14 percent slide
in 1998. LLX Logistica SA led declines in Sao Paulo after
falling to the lowest since 2009. Brazil’s Bovespa retreated to
a seven-month low. Russia’s Micex Index fell for a third day,
the longest losing streak in two weeks, as Federal Grid Co.
tumbled.  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index, a measure of
manufacturing, expanded at a slower pace for the first time in
six months. An Indian purchasing managers’ index was at 54.8 in
May from 54.9 in April, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
said in an e-mailed statement today. U.S. payrolls climbed by
69,000 last month, compared with estimates between 75,000 and
195,000 by 87 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The poor  China  PMI already produced a bad shock,”  Benoit Anne , head of  emerging markets  strategy at  Societe Generale ,
said in an e-mailed note today. “This morning’s market action
is already suggesting global emerging markets investors are
increasingly turning panicky.”  The China purchasing gauge slipped to 50.4 in May from 53.3
in April, China’s statistics bureau and logistics federation
said today. It’s the weakest reading since December and compares
with the 52 median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 27
economists. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  2012 Declines  The MSCI emerging-markets gauge has declined 2.5 percent in
2012, matching the drop for the MSCI World Index of developed
nations.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials

level since Aug. 8. The shares declined 13 percent this week.  Brazil’s  MRV Engenharia e Participacoes SA  fell 4 percent,
boosting its weekly retreat to 13 percent. LLX Logistica, a
transportation company, fell 8.1 percent to the lowest level

of the material by 10 percent from this month and urged others
to follow suit.  The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  lost 1.6 percent.  The  Taiex Index (TWSE)  tumbled 2.7 percent in Taipei, the most
since May 18.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330) , the

percentage point, to 440, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
