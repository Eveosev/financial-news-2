Serbia ’s central bank may increase
 interest rates  to quell volatility in the dinar, which weakened
to a record low this week, Vice Governor Bojan Markovic said.  “Large interventions are meaningful only when faced with
temporary shocks on the foreign-exchange market, while in case
of permanent shocks, the interest-rate response is the main
policy tool,” Markovic said by phone in Belgrade today. “But
when temporary forex pressures are particularly pronounced, a
moderate interest-rate hike can also be used as a measure in
such a case.”  The dinar has weakened 11 percent against the euro this
year, according to central bank figures. The bank has spent
nearly 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion) since February to slow
the decline of the currency and called an auction today to sell
euros to banks, according to three traders who asked for
anonymity in line with their bank policies.  Elections on May 6 were inconclusive, pushing the dinar to
record lows on concern a delay in forming a new administration
will halt progress on spending cuts and the renewal of the
country’s $1.3 billion international bailout loan.  The dinar traded at 117.9905 per euro at 1:44 p.m. in
Belgrade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, up from an
intraday low of 118.4667.  The Narodna Banka Srbije will meet on June 7 to discuss
monetary policy after leaving the two-week repurchase rate
unchanged for a fourth month on May 10 at 9.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
