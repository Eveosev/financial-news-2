Manufacturing in the U.S. grew at a
slower pace in May as factories tempered production and pared
inventories in response to weakness in the global economy.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s  factory index  fell to
53.5 after reaching a 10-month high of 54.8 in April, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group reported today. Readings greater than 50
signal growth. The median projection of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a decrease to 53.8 in May.  Manufacturing, which has been a bright spot since the
economic expansion began three years ago, may be starting to
cool. While gains in auto sales are underpinning factory growth,
the industry may become strained by stagnation in Europe’s
economy, U.S. fiscal concerns and less corporate investment.  “This signals continued moderate economic growth, not any
sort of boom or bust,”  Michael Brown , an economist at  Wells
Fargo & Co . in  Charlotte , North Carolina, said before the
report. ‘You have the uncertainty in Europe, uncertainty around
U.S. fiscal policy and the  federal budget  for next year.”  Stocks held losses after the figures as an earlier report
showed the weakest employment gains in a year. The  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  decreased 1.9 percent to 1,286.06 at 10:32 a.m.
in New York. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell to
1.47 percent from 1.56 percent late yesterday.  Estimates of the 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
ranged from 51 to 55. The gauge averaged 55.2 in 2011 and 57.3
in the previous year.  Prices Paid  The figures showed an index of prices paid by manufacturers
for raw materials shrank in May for the first time this year.
The gauge dropped to 47.5 last month from 61.  Another report from the Labor Department today showed the
smallest gain employment in a year. Payrolls rose 69,000 in May
and the jobless rate unexpectedly climbed to 8.2 percent.  The ISM’s measure of production decreased to 55.6 from 61,
while the index of export orders fell to 53.5 from 59. The
inventory index decreased to a five-month low of 46 from 48.5 a
month earlier.  The ISM’s orders gauge climbed to 60.1 last month, the
highest since April 2011, from 58.2 in April. The employment
gauge decreased, to 56.9 from 57.3 in the prior month.  The measure of orders waiting to be filled dropped to 47
from 49.5.  Around the world, manufacturing is struggling.  China  led a
slowdown in manufacturing across  Asia  that adds risks for the
global economy as Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis roils markets.  China Purchasers  The Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 50.4 in May from
53.3 in April, China’s statistics bureau and logistics
federation said in Beijing. A second gauge for China also
declined, along with measures for  India ,  South Korea  and  Taiwan .  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation  euro zone  fell to
a three-year low of 45.1 in May, indicating a 10th month of
contraction, while unemployment reached 11 percent, the highest
on record.  Another survey, from the Institute for Supply Management-
Chicago, showed yesterday that business activity in the U.S.
expanded in May at the slowest pace in more than two years as
orders and production cooled.  Stronger auto production that bolstered the  U.S. economy 
from January through March may keep bolstering manufacturing.
Cars  sold  at the fastest pace in four years in the first quarter
of the year, averaging a 14.5 million pace, according to data
from Ward’s Automotive Group. In April, vehicle purchases ran at
a 14.4 million rate.  Weaker Demand  At the same time, manufacturers are bracing for weaker
demand from Europe, where an economic slump showed signs of
deepening after Greece failed to form a government after May 6
elections and Spain struggles to clean up banks amid recession
and unemployment exceeding 20 percent.  “Europe is certainly a question mark for us right now as
the debt crisis continues to weigh on European markets,”
Michael Lamach, president and chief executive officer at
 Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR) , in Swords, Ireland, said at a May 30
conference. “Certainly the outcome here is not yet known or
clear to us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
