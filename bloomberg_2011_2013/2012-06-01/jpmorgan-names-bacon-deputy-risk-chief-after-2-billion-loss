JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  named Ashley Bacon deputy chief risk officer as the firm overhauls risk
management following a $2 billion trading loss in its chief
investment office.  Bacon will retain his role as head of firmwide market risk,
according to a memo today to employees from Chief Risk Officer
John Hogan. Bacon has been helping the New York-based company
unwind the money-losing positions.  Stephen Eichenberger was appointed wholesale chief credit
officer, in addition to his role as chief credit officer for the
investment bank, the memo shows. Sam Ramsey will take an
expanded role overseeing risks for all consumer businesses.
Marge Hannum will head consumer practices for cards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
