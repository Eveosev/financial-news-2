 Simon Coveney, director of elections
for Ireland’s ruling Fine Gael party, said early counting of
votes from yesterday’s referendum seems to be indicating a
“strong endorsement” of the European Union’s fiscal treaty.  “‘I am very hopeful that the ‘Yes’ campaign will get a
strong endorsement,’’ he said in an interview today. ‘‘That
strong endorsement seems to be materializing in the early boxes
that are being opened, and I would be very hopeful that that
would continue both in Cork and be replicated around the
country.’’  Counting began around the country at 9.a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
