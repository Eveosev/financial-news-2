New Democracy ,  Greece ’s largest pro-
bailout party, led the Syriza party, which is opposed to
implementing the country’s international rescue program,
according to a poll ahead of June 17 elections.  Of 1,200 people questioned by  Metron Analysis  for Athens-
based  ANT1 TV , 22.7 percent said they would vote for New
Democracy, 22 percent for Syriza and 11.2 percent for the
socialist Pasok party, which also backs the bailout.  The results showed New Democracy marginally improving its
support to 22.7 percent from 22.5 percent in the last poll done
by the company, on May 23 and May 24, following the inconclusive
May 6 elections. Syriza’s support fell from the 22.7 percent it
scored in that poll. Pasok also lost voters, with support
falling from the 12.3 percent in the previous poll.  More than one in two people, or 51 percent, said the June
vote is about keeping the euro, while 40 percent said it’s on
the bailout, the poll showed.  The poll was conducted May 30 to May 31. The maximum margin
of error is 2.8 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
