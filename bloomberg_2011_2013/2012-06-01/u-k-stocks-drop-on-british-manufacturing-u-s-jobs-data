U.K. stocks  tumbled to a six-month
low as the nation’s manufacturing shrank at the fastest pace
since 2009 while Chinese factory output and U.S. payrolls missed
economists’ forecasts.  Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  sank 12 percent to the lowest since
2005 after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its price estimate on
the shares.  Croda International Plc (CRDA)  and IMI Plc slid more than
2.5 percent.  BP Plc (BP/)  rose 1.8 percent after saying it will
attempt to sell its 50 percent holding in TNK-BP.  The benchmark FTSE 100 fell 60.67 points, or 1.1 percent,
to 5,260.19 at the close in London, the lowest since Nov. 25.
The FTSE All-Share Index decreased 1.2 percent today and
Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 2.4 percent. Stocks extended losses
after a report showed U.S. employers added the smallest number
of workers in a year last month.  “This is a terrible figure and this undoubtedly raises
expectations of an intervention from the  Federal Reserve  in the
form of quantitative easing,” said Stephane Ekolo, chief
European strategist at Market Securities in London. “That said,
if we need to solely rely on central banks to get any better,
that somehow demonstrates how deeply our economies and markets
are ill.”  U.S. payrolls climbed by 69,000 last month, less than the
most-pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg survey, after a revised
77,000 gain in April that was smaller than initially estimated,
Labor Department figures showed. The median economist estimate
called for a 150,000 May advance. The jobless rate rose to 8.2
percent from 8.1 percent.  FTSE Decline  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  has fallen 1.7 percent this week, bringing the
drop from this year’s high in March to 12 percent, amid concern
that Greece will be forced to leave the euro area.  U.K. manufacturing shrank last month at the fastest pace
since the depths of the financial crisis in May 2009 as demand
plunged. A  gauge of factory output , based on a survey by  Markit
Economics  and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply ,
dropped to 45.9 from 50.2 in April. The median forecast of 30
economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a decline to 49.7. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction.  The U.K. economy will almost stagnate this year and the
government needs to support the recovery with fiscal-stimulus
measures, the British Chambers of Commerce said.  Gross domestic
product  will probably rise 0.1 percent this year as the euro
area’s sovereign-debt crisis crimps demand, the London-based
group said. It had forecast growth of 0.6 percent.  In China, a  purchasing managers’ index  fell to 50.4 in May
from 53.3 in April, China’s statistics bureau and logistics
federation said today. That compared with the 52 median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Aquarius Sinks  Aquarius Platinum, an Australian producer of the metal in
southern Africa, plunged 12 percent to 64.8 pence in London, the
lowest since January 2005. Goldman Sachs cut its estimate for
the Sydney-listed shares by 34 percent to A$1.55, citing concern
over cash generation.  Companies most dependent on economic growth led losses in
the FTSE 100. Croda, the world’s second-largest maker of
cosmetic ingredients, declined 2.6 percent to 2,179 pence.  IMI (IMI) ,
the world’s biggest maker of pneumatic controls, dropped 4.4
percent to 846.5 pence.  Johnson Matthey Plc (JMAT) , the pollution
control specialist that makes a third of all autocatalysts, fell
3.3 percent to 2,100 pence.  TNK-BP  BP,  Europe’s second-biggest oil company , increased 1.8
percent to 402 pence. BP’s billionaire partners in TNK-BP,
Russia’s third-largest oil producer, made an indicative proposal
about a month ago to buy the U.K. company’s 50 percent holding.
Alfa-Access-Renova, the group that represents BP’s partners,
“sent indicative terms for a deal, which are still on the table
for discussion,” said  Stan Polovets , AAR’s chief executive
officer.  Harvey Nash Group Plc (HVN)  surged 7.3 percent to 51.5 pence, its
largest rally since February. The recruitment company said
 first-quarter revenue  rose 18 percent and gross profit climbed 6
percent. The company reported greater growth in the U.S. than in
the U.K. and Europe.  Yell Group Plc (YELL) , the publisher of U.K. yellow pages
directories, jumped 25 percent to 1.58 pence after dropping 61
percent over nine consecutive days. The company on May 22 said
that it hired Goldman Sachs and Greenhill & Co. as advisers to
help it establish a new  capital structure .  To contact the reporter on this story:
