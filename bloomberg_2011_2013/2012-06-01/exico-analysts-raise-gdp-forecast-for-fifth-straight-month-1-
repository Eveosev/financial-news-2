Mexico  economists raised their
estimate for economic growth this year for the fifth consecutive
month, according to a central bank survey.  Gross domestic product will expand 3.72 percent, the poll
of 29 economists showed, up from 3.62 percent in the previous
survey. Inflation forecasts for this year declined for a third
month, dropping to 3.65 percent from 3.68 percent the month
before. Estimates for 2013 inflation slid to 3.65 percent from
3.7. The survey was taken May 16 to May 30.  Mexicoâ€™s central bank last month raised its 2012 economic
growth forecast to a range of 3.25 percent to 4.25 percent.  Remittances climbed to $2.03 billion in April from $1.87
billion in the same month last year, the central bank said
today, more than the $1.95 billion median forecast of eight
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
