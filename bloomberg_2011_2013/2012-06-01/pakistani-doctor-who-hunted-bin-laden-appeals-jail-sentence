A Pakistani doctor who helped the
U.S. search for  Osama bin Laden  appealed a 33-year jail sentence
delivered by a tribal court for conspiring with militants.  Shakil Afridi’s lawyers submitted the appeal today, Tariq
Jamil, a commissioner at the court, said by telephone from
Peshawar today.  Afridi was imprisoned for providing funding and medical
assistance to the now defunct militant group Lashkar-e-Islam,
which killed members of the public and security forces in a
series of attacks, the court said in the five-page ruling given
to reporters in Peshawar this week.  The appellant had no links with Lashkar-e-Islam, didn’t
provide medical help and was kidnapped by the group in 2008 and
forced to pay 1 million rupees ($10,675) as ransom, according to
the appeal document. “The allegations of financial assistance
of 2 million rupees are false and baseless.”  U.S. and Pakistani officials said Afridi ran a fake
vaccination program in Abbottabad, the Pakistani town where al-
Qaeda leader bin Laden hid for as long as five years, in a bid
to obtain a DNA sample from those living in the compound where
he was shot dead by Navy SEALs in May 2011, according to the
Washington Post.  The details of his sentencing made available yesterday for
the first time make no mention of the Abbottabad program, while
stating that allegations Afridi conspired with foreign
intelligence agencies were outside its jurisdiction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
