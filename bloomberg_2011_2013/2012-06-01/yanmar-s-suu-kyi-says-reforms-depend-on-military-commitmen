Myanmar opposition leader Aung San
Suu Kyi said the sustainability of political reforms in the
country will depend on the commitment of the miltary and the
nation.  Suu Kyi, speaking at the  World Economic Forum  on  East Asia 
in Bangkok on her first trip abroad in 24 years, also said her
country needs to improve basic education to bolster economic
development and ensure the reform process becomes irreversible.  Suu Kyi said investment in Myanmar should not create more
corruption and “greater privilege for the already privileged.”
Instead, investment should focus on job-creation, and informal
training for Myanmar’s workforce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
