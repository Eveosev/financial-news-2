photographer.  He arranged and repositioned his own work in the studio,
playing with light and shadow, and in his photographs he created
compelling new images. There are several beautiful shots of
“Bird in Space.”  There are also still-lifes and self-portraits.  Runs through June 23 at Silverstein, 535 W. 24th St.
