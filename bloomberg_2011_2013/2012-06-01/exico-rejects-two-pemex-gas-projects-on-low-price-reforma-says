Mexico’s Hydrocarbons Commission
rejected plans from  Petroleos Mexicanos  to develop two offshore
natural-gas fields, including a deep-water project, citing low
gas prices,  Reforma reported  today.  The projects “are economically inviable” amid low gas
prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, the
Mexico City-based newspaper reported today, citing documents
from the country’s regulator known as CNH.
