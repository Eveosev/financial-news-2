European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co., the parent of planemaker Airbus SAS, may seek to gain a
banking license to broaden its options to ensure financing for
airlines and suppliers, its former chief financial officer said.  Such a license is among several options being studied at
the company, Hans Peter Ring was cited as saying in an interview
with Financial Times Deutschland. Martin Aguera, a spokesman for
EADS, confirmed the comments.  A license would also hand EADS direct access to European
Central Bank money supply, at a time when some traditional banks
are struggling with rating cuts, which Ring said is his prime
concern.  Ring retired as CFO yesterday as part of a broader
management reshuffle. No decision has been made on a banking
license, according to Ringâ€™s comments.  EADS still expects to continue working with European banks
to help airline customers win financing, Ring said. EADS often
has a better ranking that the banks that take its money, he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
