Russiaâ€™s  Finance Ministry  has
submitted a budget rule proposal to Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev , Interfax reported, citing the proposal.  The ministry proposed calculating the budget based on the
average oil price for the past five years starting in 2013, the
Moscow-based news service reported. The average price used in
subsequent budgets would add a year until 2018, after which the
10-year average would be used, Interfax reported.  Federal government spending would be capped under the new
rule to allow a deficit of no more than 1 percent of gross
domestic product, the news service reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
