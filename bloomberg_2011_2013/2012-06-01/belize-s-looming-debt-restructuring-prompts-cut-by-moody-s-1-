Belize’s debt rating was cut for the
second time this year by Moody’s Investors Service, citing a
probable restructuring of the government’s $547 million bond and
“weak economic growth” in the Central American nation.  Moody’s lowered Belize’s foreign-currency debt rating to
Ca, or 10 levels below investment grade, from Caa1, the company
said in an e-mailed report today. Prime Minister Dean Barrow,
who won a second five-year term in March, has vowed to
restructure the so-called superbond. The security was approved
in 2007 to help consolidate the country’s debt, which totals
about $1 billion, more than 70 percent of the nation’s $1.4
billion economy, according to the central bank.  “The economic outlook is tough,” said  Boris Segura , a
Latin America analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in  New York .
“Public-sector debt as it is is unsustainable.”  Barrow’s comments led Moody’s and  Standard & Poor’s  to
lower the country’s credit rating in February. Barrow said at
the time that he didn’t “give a damn about the rating
agencies” and that the superbond restructuring was needed for
the “development of Belize, for the people of this country.”  Yields on Belize’s dollar bonds due in 2029, part of the
superbond, were little changed at 19.10 percent. The yields have
risen almost 300 basis points, or 3 percentage points, this
year.  Yield Spread  The extra yield investors demand to hold Belize’s
government dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries increased 10
basis points to 1,704, the highest among countries tracked by
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global index including Argentina,
Venezuela and  Pakistan .  “Fiscal space remains limited and public debt is set to
report an unsustainable trajectory in coming years as a result
of rising debt service costs and limited growth prospects,”
Moody’s said in its report today.  It’s not clear how much of a reduction in their investment
bond holders should expect in another debt negotiation,
according to Segura.  “That’s the big question,” Segura said. “Will it be a
friendly or unfriendly restructuring?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
