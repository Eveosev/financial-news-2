Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz held onto
the U.S. luxury-vehicle sales lead for the year over  Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW brand, as Mercedes deliveries in May
jumped 19 percent.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Lexus brand, rebounding from inventory
shortages after last year’s earthquake and tsunami in Japan,
soared 74 percent to 21,463.  U.S. sales of Mercedes vehicles rose to 22,515 last month
while BMW deliveries increased 7.3 percent to 22,168, according
to statements yesterday from the companies. Lexus and Mercedes-
Benz increased incentives 37 percent and 23 percent compared to
BMW’s 0.8 percent gain, according to  Santa Monica , California-
based researcher TrueCar.com.  “In a lot of the key markets, leasing can make up three-
quarters of sales,”  Jesse Toprak , a TrueCar analyst, said in an
interview yesterday. Luxury-vehicle incentives often take the
form of lease offers.  BMW and Mercedes both overtook Lexus last year, with BMW
emerging as the top U.S. auto luxury brand. BMW, based in
Munich, finished the first quarter of 2012 with 36 more
deliveries than Mercedes.  Mercedes sales for this year through May increased 18
percent to 106,364, giving the Stuttgart, Germany-based
automaker a lead of 1,585 vehicles over BMW, which had a sales
increase of 14 percent for the period. Lexus deliveries rose 14
percent to 88,110 in the first five months.  The results exclude Daimler’s Sprinter vans and Smart cars
and BMW’s Mini brand, which aren’t  luxury vehicles .  C-Class, M-Class  Mercedes was helped by deliveries of the updated C-Class
sedan, up 35 percent in May, and the M-Class sport-utility
vehicle, up 66 percent, the automaker said in a statement
yesterday.  BMW and Mercedes are also in a global luxury race with
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi brand.  Audi deliveries rose 10 percent in the U.S. last month to
11,503, the 17th consecutive month of record sales, the premium
brand of Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW, said in a statement. After
five months, Audi’s U.S. sales this year rose 14 percent to
52,494, ahead of  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac brand at 50,688.  Cadillac declined 15 percent to 9,871 in May as the luxury
brand suffered from the elimination of old models before new
ones, such as the XTS, reach dealers starting this month.
Cadillac sales have fallen 22 percent through May, the company
said in a statement yesterday.  Acura, Porsche  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , based in Tokyo, said in a statement that
sales for its Acura brand rose 62 percent to 14,586 last month.
Acura year-earlier sales were affected by production disruptions
stemming from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.  Porsche AG (PAH3) , the Stuttgart-based automaker, sold 2,852
vehicles in the U.S., a 1.2 percent gain, the company said in a
statement.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s Infiniti sold 10,592 vehicles, a 66
percent gain from a year earlier, the Yokohama, Japan-based
company said in a statement yesterday.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 7,274 Lincolns in May, a 1.7 percent
decline from a year earlier, according to a statement from the
Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker.  Land Rover deliveries rose 19 percent to 3,438, while
Jaguar sales declined 15 percent to 1,075, according to an e-
mailed statement. The U.K. brands are owned by Mumbai-based  Tata
Motors Ltd. (TTMT)   To contact the reporter on this story:
