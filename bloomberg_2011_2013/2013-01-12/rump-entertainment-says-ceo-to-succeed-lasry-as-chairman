Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc.,
operator of two casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, said Chief
Executive Officer Robert Griffin will take up the additional
position of chairman after the resignation of  Marc Lasry .  Lasry, 53, chairman and CEO of the firm Avenue Capital
Group, a major investor in Trump Entertainment Resorts, plans to
step down at the end of February, the Atlantic City-based resort
company said in a regulatory filing yesterday. Griffin has been
CEO since 2010, according to the filing.  Avenue Capital, which invests in the securities of
distressed companies, became a major shareholder in closely held
Trump Entertainment Resorts when the casino operator emerged
from bankruptcy in 2010. Michael Elkins, a portfolio manager at
Avenue Capital, will replace Lasry on the board, according to
the filing.  Gambling revenue in Atlantic City fell 8.9 percent in
December, state  regulators  said this month. Trump Entertainment
Resorts owns and runs the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort and
Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino, both located on the Boardwalk in
 Atlantic City . Together they have more than 4,100  slot machines ,
about 250 table games and more than 2,900 hotel rooms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
