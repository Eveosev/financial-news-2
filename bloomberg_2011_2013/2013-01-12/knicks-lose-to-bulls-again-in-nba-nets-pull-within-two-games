The  New York Knicks  lost at home to
the Chicago Bulls, their third straight National Basketball
Association defeat, and had their Atlantic division lead over
the Brooklyn Nets cut to two games.  Luol Deng scored 33 points in Chicago’s 108-101 win last
night at Madison Square Garden. It was the Knicks’ second home
loss to the Bulls in three weeks, following a 110-106 victory by
Chicago on Dec. 21.  Joe Johnson  scored 19 points as the Nets won their fifth
straight game, a 99-79 victory at home against the Phoenix Suns.
Brooklyn now has won seven of eight games since P.J. Carlesimo
took over as interim coach when Avery Johnson was fired Dec. 27.  “We’ve just got to try to keep this thing rolling,”
Johnson said in an on-court interview at the Barclays Center in
Brooklyn after the Nets rallied from an 11-point second-quarter
deficit by outscoring the Suns 53-26 in the second half.  Deron Williams  had 15 points for the Nets (21-15) despite
hurting his right thigh early in the third quarter.  Gerald Wallace  also was injured for Brooklyn, leaving the game in the
first quarter with bruised ribs.  The Knicks (23-13) fell behind by 21 points at halftime and
never recovered against the Bulls. Carmelo Anthony, who sat out
a loss the night before at Indiana because of a suspension,
missed his first seven shots before leading the Knicks with 39
points.  Anthony was suspended for repeatedly confronting  Kevin Garnett  of the Boston Celtics following a Jan. 7 Knicks loss at
Madison Square Garden.  The Knicks, who have lost eight of their last 13 games
after starting the season 18-5, host the New Orleans Hornets
tomorrow before heading to London to play the Detroit Pistons on
Jan. 17 at the O2 arena.  To contact the reporter on this story:
