Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  ordered the army to remove a tent camp set up by
Palestinians yesterday in an area of the West Bank known as E-1
just east of  Jerusalem .  The government asked the  High Court  of Justice to cancel a
stay of evacuation it issued yesterday in response to a petition
by protest supporters, according to a text message sent by the
Prime Minister’s Office.  Netanyahu ordered that in the meantime the area be declared
a “closed military zone” and sealed off to prevent further
gatherings there, according to the message.  An Israeli decision on Nov. 30 to issue preliminary
approval for the building of new homes in E-1 sparked criticism
from the U.S., European Union and  United Nations .  Palestinians say building in E-1 would disrupt the
territorial viability of a future state in which east Jerusalem
would serve as the capital. Israel has said plans to build there
date back decades to previous governments and that the area
should remain under its control in a final peace agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
