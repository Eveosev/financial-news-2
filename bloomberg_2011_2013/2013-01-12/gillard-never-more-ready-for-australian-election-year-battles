Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard , lagging in opinion polls ahead of an election that must
be held by November, said she is ready for the political
skirmishes and the campaign ahead.  “Entering 2013, I’ve never felt more ready,” Gillard
wrote in a letter published in the  Sunday Telegraph  today.  Gillard’s  Labor Party  had 32 percent support in a Dec. 10
Newspoll survey, while  Tony Abbott ’s Liberal-National opposition
attracted 46 percent. Gillard ended the year under attack over
her work as a labor union lawyer 20 years ago while her
government last month gave up a pledge to deliver a  budget
surplus  in the current fiscal year.  Gillard leads a minority government after winning the
closest Australian election in seven decades in 2010, just three
months after winning the prime minister’s job in a party coup
against predecessor  Kevin Rudd .  Australia’s first female leader has countered that Abbott,
whom she accused of sexism and misogyny in an October speech in
parliament, was using negative tactics in a campaign to smear
her reputation.  The government’s policy priority this year will be “a
giant leap forward in education,” Gillard wrote in her letter.
“I will do everything necessary to make sure we properly fund
schools and drive school improvement so every child in every
school is getting a great education.”  Other focuses will be on support and services to families,
national security, implementing the  national broadband network 
for Australian homes and modernizing infrastructure, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
