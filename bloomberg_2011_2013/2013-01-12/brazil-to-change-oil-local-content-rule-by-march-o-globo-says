Brazil oil regulator is reviewing
the industryâ€™s local content rules and expects to introduce
changes by the end of March, newspaper  O Globo  reported, citing
Marcelo Mafra, head of local content at the agency known as  ANP .  The review will allow the servicing and maintenance of
drilling rigs done in Brazilian shipyards to be included in the
local content certification process, columnist Flavia Oliveira
reported. This will be the first time the rule is being reviewed
since its sanctioning in 2007, the Rio de Janeiro-based
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
