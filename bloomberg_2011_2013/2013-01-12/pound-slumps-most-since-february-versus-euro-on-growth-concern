The pound posted its biggest weekly
decline against the euro since February amid speculation the
U.K. is struggling to maintain growth as European policy makers
signaled optimism for the euro-region’s economy.  Sterling slipped to a nine-month low against the 17-member
currency after U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  predicted a
difficult year for the U.K. The Bank of England refrained from
adding further stimulus while holding its key  interest rate  at a
record low of 0.5 percent. A government report yesterday showed
U.K.  manufacturing production  unexpectedly fell in November.
Gilts advanced.  “We’re still seeing the easing of euro-zone sovereign debt
concerns leading to a weakening of safe-haven inflows to the
U.K.,” said  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London. “That’s effectively
removing a key pillar of support for the pound, leaving it more
vulnerable to the still very weak U.K. economic fundamentals.”  The pound depreciated 1.8 percent in the week to 82.77
pence per euro at 4:51 p.m.  London  time yesterday, when it
depreciated to 82.87 pence, the weakest level since April 4.
That’s the biggest weekly move since Feb. 24. Sterling advanced
0.4 percent to $1.6133.  The pound has fallen 1.3 percent since the start of 2013,
the second-worst performer among 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen slid
3.5 percent.  “It’s a tough economic environment that we’re in,”
Cameron said on  BBC Television ’s “Andrew Marr Show” on Jan. 6.
“Right now, Britain needs low interest rates.”  Gilt Yields  The  10-year gilt  yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.08 percent, after climbing 30 basis
points points in the week ended Jan. 4. The 1.75 percent bond
due in September 2022 rose 0.32, or 3.20 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 97.11.  Sterling lost as much as 1 percent versus the 17-nation
currency yesterday, its steepest intraday slide since September,
after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said a day
earlier that the euro-area economy will slowly return to health
in 2013 as the region’s bond markets stabilize.  Banks are becoming less bullish on the pound against the
euro, according to Bloomberg surveys. The median forecast of 49
lenders calls for sterling to end the year at 81 pence per euro,
from 80 pence a week earlier.  The U.K. is scheduled to auction 1 billion pounds of
inflation-linked debt due in 2029 on Jan. 17. The sale comes
two-days after data that economists said will show retail price
inflation held at 3 percent last month. A separate report the
same day will show consumer-price inflation was at the highest
rate since May for a third month, according to another survey.  U.K. 10-year  inflation-linked bond  yields tumbled to the
lowest level since Bloomberg started collecting the data in
1992. The rate slid to as low as minus -0.99 percent two days
ago after the  Office for National Statistics  said it will
maintain its current formula for calculating the retail  price
index , allaying concern that a change may dent returns on the
securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
