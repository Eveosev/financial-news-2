The National Hockey League Players’
Association approved the new collective bargaining agreement
reached with the owners last week.  While the vote ratifies the 10-year agreement between the
sides, a written memorandum of understanding must be completed
before the deal becomes final, the union said in a statement.  The two sides will continue to work on the memorandum, the
union said. Once it’s completed, training camps can open and the
schedule for a lockout-shortened season will be announced.  The NHL’s Board of Governors approved the new agreement on
Jan. 9. The two sides agreed on the contract’s framework three
days earlier, ending a shutdown that began on Sept. 16 and
forced the cancellation of over 600 games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
