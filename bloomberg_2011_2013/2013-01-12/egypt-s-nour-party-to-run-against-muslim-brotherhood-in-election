The ultraconservative Salafist Nour
Party will compete with the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and
Justice Party in parliamentary elections, signaling a rift
between the country’s two largest Islamist movements.  The Nour party’s relationship with the Brotherhood is
“tense,” Younis Makhioun, the group’s recently elected head,
said in an interview with the state-run Al Ahram newspaper
published today. “Our views on managing the state are
different,” he said.  Makhioun was elected as head on Jan. 9 after 150 members
resigned to form the Watan Party. The Nour Party trailed the
Freedom and Justice Party in parliamentary elections last year,
winning a quarter of seats.  Egypt  will start procedures for
legislative elections on Feb. 25, state-run Ahram Gate website
said, without elaborating.  The party may run for the presidency once the term of the
Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Mursi ends in 2016, Makhioun said
in a separate interview with the Asharq Alawsat newspaper
published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
