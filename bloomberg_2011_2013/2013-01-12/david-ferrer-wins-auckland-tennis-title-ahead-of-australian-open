David Ferrer  beat Philipp Kohlschreiber in straight sets to win the Heineken Open tennis
championship for the third year in a row.  Ferrer, ranked fifth by the ATP World Tour, won 7-6 (7-5)
6-1, over the No. 19 German last night in Auckland. It was the
30-year-old Spaniard’s fourth career triumph at the tournament,
which is a warm-up for the Australian Open.  “I won in Auckland again and now I want to enjoy this
moment because it is very special to me,” Ferrer said on the
tournament’s website. “And then tomorrow I will go to Melbourne
and I will practice again.”  The Australian Open, the year’s first Grand Slam
tournament, begins tomorrow at Melbourne Park. Defending
champions Novak Djokovic of Serbia and  Victoria Azarenka  of
Belarus are the top seeds.  Bernard Tomic  beat South African Kevin Anderson 6-3, 6-7
(2-7), 6-3 in the final of the Sydney International. It’s the
20-year-old Australia’s first ATP World Tour title.  “Now I know what it feels like to win a tournament, and
it’s the best feeling in the world,” Tomic told reporters. “To
do it here in Sydney is awesome. I can’t ask for anything
better.”  Russia’s Elena Vesnina also captured her first title on the
WTA Tour by beating defending champion Mona Barthel of Germany
6-3, 6-4 in the final of the Hobart International in Australia.  Australia’s  Lleyton Hewitt  beat seventh-ranked Juan Martin Del Potro of Argentina 6-1, 6-4 in the final of the Kooyong
Classic, an eight-man exhibition event in Melbourne.  To contact the reporter on this story:
