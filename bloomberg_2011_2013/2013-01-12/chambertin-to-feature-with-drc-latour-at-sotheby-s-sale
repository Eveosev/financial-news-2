Leading wines of Burgundy producer
Domaine Armand Rousseau will go on sale with  Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti  and Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in
London this month.  Top lots at the Jan. 30 sale include a case of Chambertin
1999  Rousseau  carrying an estimate of as much as 12,000 pounds
($19,300) and 12 bottles of Chambertin Clos de Beze 2005
Rousseau estimated to fetch as much as 10,500 pounds, according
to the auction house’s website.  Wine sales by the biggest auction houses fell 19 percent
last year and the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index fell 9.7 percent,
its second straight annual decline, as buying from  China , the
main driver for investment wines, was sluggish in the first
three quarters. The index fell 14 percent in the four months to
Aug. 1 before stabilizing and starting to recoup losses.  The market “feels a bit more positive,”  Chris Smith ,
investment manager at  The Wine Investment Fund  in London, said.
“Demand has been fairly consistent over the past six months.”
The fund, which has $73 million under management, is predicting
a 14 percent increase in the Bordeaux-dominated Liv-ex 100 wine
index this year.  The Sotheby’s auction this month also includes a 12-bottle
Domaine de la Romanee-Conti 1999 assortment estimated at as much
as 34,000 pounds and Chateau Latour 1996 priced as much as 5,500 
pounds a case, as well as Krug Champagne.  New York-based  Acker Merrall & Condit  also has a two-day
auction scheduled to start in Hong Kong on Jan. 25, while Zachys
was due to complete its  Hong Kong  New-Year sale today.  Following is a list of global wine sales scheduled so far
this year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to
auction house sale catalogs and websites.
