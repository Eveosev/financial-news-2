Western  Australia ’s iron-ore port of
Dampier, the world’s biggest shipper of the commodity, reopened
as the threat passed from Severe Tropical Cyclone Narelle off
the coast.  “The cyclone has been downgraded and it’s tracking
south,” said Brooke Grieves, communications adviser at the
Dampier Port Authority, which reopened operations midmorning
local time. There were no reports of damage from high winds in
the past two days, she said.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the world’s second-biggest producer,
suspended loading iron ore onto ships on Jan. 10 after
authorities closed the Dampier and Cape Lambert ports as Narelle
developed in the Indian Ocean off the northwestern coast of
Western Australia. There were forecasts of winds as strong as
140 kilometers (88 miles) an hour if the storm moved close to
the coast.  Earlier today, Narelle was downgraded to category 4, after
earlier being graded at the highest category 5, the Bureau of
Meteorology said on its  website .  While the storm center isn’t forecast to make landfall,
high winds, tides and heavy rain are predicted for coastal areas.
The storm is now about 450 kilometers to the west of Dampier and
heading south.  To contact the reporter on this story:
