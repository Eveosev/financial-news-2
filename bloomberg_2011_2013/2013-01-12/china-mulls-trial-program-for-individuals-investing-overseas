China has started preparations for a
trial program that would allow individuals to invest in overseas
 capital markets  as the nation seeks a greater role for its
currency in global finance.  The People’s Bank of China will proactively prepare for the
trial of its qualified domestic individual investor program, it
said in a  statement  on its website yesterday, without giving
further details. The central bank lists the so-called QDII2
initiative as one of its major goals for 2013.  China is seeking to reduce its reliance on the dollar after
accumulating $3.31 trillion of  foreign-exchange reserves , the
world’s largest stockpile. The country’s foreign-exchange
regulator said in April that it will gradually open more
channels for capital outflows and relax restrictions on
residents’ overseas investments, as it seeks to make the  yuan  a
fully convertible currency.  The government started the QDII program in 2006, allowing
Chinese individuals to buy securities in overseas markets
through asset managers and funds. A total of $85.6 billion in
quotas were awarded to 107 institutions, including Bank of China
Ltd. and HSBC (Bank) China Co., as of Dec. 31, according to the
State Administration of Foreign Exchange.  In August 2007, China unveiled a so-called “through-
train” program, in which citizens could invest directly in  Hong
Kong  stocks, and helped push the benchmark Hang Seng Index to a
record high that October. The State Administration of Foreign
Exchange said in January 2010 it scrapped the plan and instead
expanded the QDII system for investment overseas.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 0.4 percent yesterday to
23,264.07. It reached a record 31,638.22 on Oct. 30, 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
