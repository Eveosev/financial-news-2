Japan ’s Ryo Ishikawa and Thailand’s
Thaworn Wiratchant have accepted invitations to play in the
Masters Tournament, according to Augusta National Golf Club
chairman  Billy Payne .  The addition of Ishikawa and Wiratchant brings the number
of players in the Masters field to 85. The field represents 21
countries.  “Through our established qualifications, and invitations
to select international players not otherwise qualified, we
historically bring together a collection of the world’s top
players, and this year is no different,” Payne said yesterday
in a statement on the tournament’s website.  Ishikawa, 21, will enter his fifth straight Masters
tournament. He has missed the cut in three of his previous four
appearances and tied for 20th in 2011.  Wiratchant, 46, who has never played in the U.S., won last
year’s Order of Merit on the Asian Tour, and is the tour’s
career leader with 15 victories. He will make his first start at
the Masters in Augusta,  Georgia , on April 11.  Last year’s winner was American Bubba Watson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
