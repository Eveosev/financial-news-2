Spain’s bonds advanced for a second
week, pushing two-year yields to the lowest level since October
2010, as the country sold more securities than planned at its
first debt auction this year.  Germany’s 10-year  bund yields  increased for a second week
as the  European Central Bank  refrained from cutting  interest
rates  on Jan. 10 and President  Mario Draghi  said the euro-area
economy should gradually recover this year, damping demand for
the region’s safest assets. Irish securities rose after the
country sold five-year debt through banks in a step to become
the first euro country to exit a bailout program.  “The market has been more upbeat about the euro region and
that benefits peripheral assets like Spanish debt,” said
 Padhraic Garvey , the head of developed-market debt strategy at
ING Bank NV in Amsterdam. “We expect this to continue in the
first half of the year. There’s a growing market view along the
line that there’s enough ammunition on the table to solve any
immediate problem the  euro zone  might have.”  Spanish  two-year note  yields slid 30 basis points, or 0.3
percentage point, this week to 2.13 percent as of 5 p.m. in
 London  yesterday, after falling to 2.08 percent on Jan. 10, the
lowest since Oct. 28, 2010. The 3.3 percent note due in October
2014 gained 0.51, or 5.10 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,335) face
amount, to 102.025.  The 10-year yield dropped 17 basis points to 4.89 percent.
The rate fell as low as 4.84 percent yesterday, the  least  since
March 1.  Spanish Auction  Spain  sold a combined 5.8 billion euros of securities on
Jan. 10, exceeding its maximum target of 5 billion euros. It
allotted 3.4 billion euros of notes due in March 2015, which
include collective-action clauses that limit investors’ rights
to oppose writedowns, at an average yield of 2.476 percent.  German bonds fell as the ECB kept the main refinancing rate
at a  record low  of 0.75 percent a month after calls for a cut
from some of its Governing Council. Draghi said the decision was
“unanimous.”  Germany’s  10-year bund  yield added five basis points this
week to 1.58 percent. It climbed to 1.61 percent yesterday, the
highest since Oct. 25.  Italian and Irish bonds also rose this week as debt sales
suggested investors’ confidence in the way leaders and policy
makers handled the euro-region crisis has improved.  Yields Fall  Italy’s  two-year yield  dropped 32 basis points from Jan. 4
to 1.36 percent as borrowing costs fell at an auction yesterday.
The country sold 3.5 billion euros of notes maturing in December
2015 at an average yield of 1.85 percent, down from 2.50 percent
at the previous sale last month.  Ireland received orders for about 7 billion euros for its
notes due in October 2017 compared with the 2.5 billion euros
the Dublin-based  National Treasury Management Agency  sold at
3.32 percent on Jan. 8. Prime Minister  Enda Kenny  said the sale
was a success. The country received a bailout in 2010 as the
state and its banks were shut out of  capital markets .  The  Irish five-year  yield dropped eight basis points this
week to 3.11 percent.  “We are now back in a normal situation from a financial
viewpoint, but we are not at all seeing an early and strong
recovery,” Draghi said at a press conference in  Frankfurt .  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads
euro-area finance ministers, echoed that by saying, “the worst
is over, but what we still have to do is difficult.”  Spanish bonds returned 2.3 percent this year through Jan.
10, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian securities
gained 2.1 percent, while German bunds lost 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
