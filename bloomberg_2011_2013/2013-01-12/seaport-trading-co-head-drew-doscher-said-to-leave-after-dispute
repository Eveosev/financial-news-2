Drew Doscher, co-head of sales and
trading at Seaport Group, left the New York-based securities
firm, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  Doscher, 43, the former head of distressed debt at  UBS AG (UBSN) 
and  Barclays Plc (BARC) , resigned yesterday after a dispute with
Seaport co-founders Michael Meagher and  Stephen Smith , said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the departure
hadn’t been announced. Doscher and Meagher declined to comment.  Doscher and Michael Meyer, who also ran sales and trading,
joined Seaport in 2009, according to Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority records. Since then, the firm more than
doubled revenue to $80.1 million in  2011  from $29.8 million in
 2008 , regulatory filings show.  The firm, founded in 2001 as a distressed-debt broker, now
has about 200 employees who trade bonds, private placements and
structured products, according to its  website . Smith and Meyer
didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.  Doscher is also an owner of the Sloppy Tuna, a bar and
restaurant in Montauk,  New York , according to a  report  in East
Hampton Patch, a news website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
