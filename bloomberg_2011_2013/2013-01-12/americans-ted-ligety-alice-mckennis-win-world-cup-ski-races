Ted Ligety of the U.S. won the men’s
World Cup giant slalom in Switzerland, while countrywoman Alice
McKennis took the women’s downhill in  Austria .  Ligety had a time of 2 minutes, 28.67 seconds over two runs
to beat  Germany ’s Fritz Dopfer by 1.15 seconds. Felix Neureuther
of Germany finished third.  The victory was Ligety’s first on the Koenigsberg course in
Adelboden and extends his lead in the giant slalom season
standings to 125 points over Austria’s Marcel Hirscher, who
finished 16th today.  “This has been a tough course for me in my career so I’m
happy to get the win,” the 28-year-old said on the U.S. Ski
Team’s website. “The second run was so dark and this hill is so
tiring. I was lucky to have a little bit of reserve strength.”  Hirscher continues to lead the overall World Cup standings
with 755 points, 26 more than  Norway ’s Aksel Lund Svindal and
103 ahead of Ligety in third.  McKennis, 23, won the women’s downhill in St. Anton by 0.07
seconds over Italy’s Daniela Merighetti for her first World Cup
victory. Austria’s Anna Fenninger finished third, with overall
World Cup leader Tina Maze of Slovenia in fourth.  Four-time World Cup champion Lindsey Vonn of the U.S. was
sixth in her return to action. Vonn had taken the past two weeks
off to recover from fatigue caused by a stomach illness that
hospitalized her in November.  Vonn continues to lead the downhill season standings, with
Maze maintaining her lead in the overall table.  To contact the reporter on this story:
