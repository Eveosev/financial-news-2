The  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
said contractors have completed the first phase of emergency
work to remove rocks that have held up barge traffic in the
drought-stricken  Mississippi  River.  Contractors have excavated about 365 cubic yards (279 cubic
meters) of limestone from the river near the town of Thebes in
southern  Illinois , deepening the channel by about two feet, the
Corps said in a statement today.  “The work has deepened the channel enough to successfully
maintain navigation through this critical reach of the river,”
Major General John Peabody, the Corps’ Mississippi Valley
division commander, said in the  statement .  Barge traffic for shippers including  Archer-Daniels-Midland
Co. (ADM)  of Decatur, Illinois, has slowed on the river due to shallow
water caused by the worst U.S. drought since the 1930s. About
$2.8 billion worth of cargo, including grain, coal and
fertilizer, moves along the Mississippi during a typical
January, according to the American Waterways Operators, an
Arlington, Virginia-based industry group. The group has called
for more water to be released from reservoirs upstream from St.
Louis if drought conditions worsen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
