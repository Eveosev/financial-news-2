Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. said it
is still in talks with Matinee Energy Inc. of the U.S. to build
two solar  power plants  in Arizona. Hyundai Heavy denied a Maeil
Business Newspaper report that it has abandoned the project,
adding that it will construct the plants for the U.S. company,
according to Kim Ki Young, a Hyundai Heavy spokesman said. The
two companies signed a memorandum of understanding in August
last year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
