The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment declined,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  decreased 6 basis points to 202 as of
8:58 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. Thatâ€™s on track for the lowest level and the biggest daily
decline since Oct. 19, according to CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc., and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 4 basis points to 192
basis points as of 9:55 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The benchmark is headed for the biggest daily decline
since Oct. 17, CMA prices in New York show. The Markit iTraxx
Australia index fell 3 basis points to 182.5 as of 12:07 p.m. in
Sydney, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default, and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
