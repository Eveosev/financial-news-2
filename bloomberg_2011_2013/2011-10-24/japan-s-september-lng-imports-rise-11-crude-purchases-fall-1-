Japan ’s imports of liquefied natural
gas climbed 11 percent to 6.7 million metric tons in September
from a year earlier, the  finance ministry  said.  Crude oil imports dropped 4.4 percent to 16.97 million
kiloliters, while thermal-coal imports fell 3.9 percent to 8.25
million tons, the ministry said in a preliminary report today.  Power utilities increased thermal power generation by 11.9
percent in the month because of low operating rates at nuclear
stations, according to data released by the Federation of
Electric Power Companies of Japan. The utilization rate was at
20.6 percent, the lowest since the federation started compiling
monthly data in April 1977, it said.  The following table shows Japan’s imports for September:
