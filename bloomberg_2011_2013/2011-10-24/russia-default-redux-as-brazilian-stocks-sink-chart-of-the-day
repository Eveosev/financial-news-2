Brazilian equities are trading at
the biggest discount versus their Mexican shares in 13 years, a
sign to PineBridge Investments to start buying consumer stocks
in  Latin America ’s largest economy.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that the difference between the
MSCI Mexico Index’s price-to-earnings ratio on Oct. 21 was the
widest versus the MSCI  Brazil  Index’s since October 1998, when
investor concern mounted that Brazil would default after  Russia 
halted local debt payments two months earlier.  MSCI Brazil has plunged 25 percent this year, pushing its
price-to-earnings ratio down to 8.5, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Mexico gauge has fallen 15 percent this year,
leaving its ratio at 22.7.  “There is a lot of value in Brazil but it’s still a stock-
pickers market,” Stacy Steimel, who manages $800 million of
Latin American stocks at PineBridge, said Oct. 21 in a telephone
interview from Santiago. “Interest rates are coming down, and
some of the consumer names have been hit. There is such
incredible value.”  Brazil’s equity valuations and interest-rate cuts over the
past two months provide an opportunity to invest in companies
that will benefit from consumers’ growing purchasing power,
Steimel said. She said she prefers  Marisa Lojas SA (AMAR3)  over other
retailers such as Lojas Renner SA or  Lojas Americanas SA (LAME4)  because
more of its revenue is dependent on credit growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
