Olympus Corp. (7733) , the world’s biggest
maker of endoscopes, extended declines to the lowest level in 
more than 13 years in  Tokyo  trading after its largest 
stakeholders urged the company to review past acquisitions.  Olympus dropped as much as 18 percent to 1,012 yen, the
lowest intraday level since March 1998. The stock traded 12
percent lower at 1,080 yen at the 11 a.m. break on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, while  Japan ’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
gained 1.4 percent.  Southeastern Asset Management Inc., the third-largest
shareholder, last week joined Nippon Life Insurance Co. and
Harris Associates LP in asking Olympus to respond to investor
concerns about takeover payments that have erased about $5
billion from its market value. Tokyo-based Olympus will form an
independent committee to investigate past acquisitions, it said
Oct. 21.  “The situation is still unclear and may take a while to
settle,”  Mitsuo Shimizu , an analyst at Cosmo Securities Co. in
Tokyo, said by telephone. “That’s worrying investors and
prompting them to unload their stakes.”  Olympus has tumbled 56 percent since Oct. 14, wiping out
380.4 billion yen ($5 billion) in value, after the board said 
it fired Michael C. Woodford as chief executive officer. 
Woodford later made public a PricewaterhouseCoopers report 
saying the company may face regulatory scrutiny over payments 
made to advisers in the acquisition of Gyrus Group Plc in 2008.  The report included “assumptions” and “speculation” and
is misleading, Olympus said Oct. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
