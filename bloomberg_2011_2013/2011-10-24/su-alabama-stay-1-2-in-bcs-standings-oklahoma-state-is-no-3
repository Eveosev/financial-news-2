Louisiana State and the  University
of Alabama  remain the top two teams in college football’s Bowl
Championship Series standings, two weeks ahead of their Nov. 5
meeting in Tuscaloosa,  Alabama .  LSU (8-0) has a .9702 BCS rating out of 1.000, while
Southeastern Conference rival Alabama (8-0) is at .9627.
Oklahoma State (7-0) moved up one place to third in the BCS
rankings as Oklahoma (6-1) dropped six spots to ninth following
yesterday’s 41-38 loss to Texas Tech.  Boise State (7-0) is fourth in the BCS, followed by Clemson
(8-0) and Stanford (7-0). Oregon (6-1) is the highest-ranked
one-loss team at No. 7, while Kansas State (7-0), Oklahoma (6-1)
and Arkansas (6-1) round out the top ten.  The teams finishing No. 1 and No. 2 in the final BCS
standings will play for the national championship on Jan. 9 in
