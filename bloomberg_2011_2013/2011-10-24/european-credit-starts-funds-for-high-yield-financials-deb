European Credit Management Ltd. , a
money manager majority owned by  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , started funds
to buy high-yield bonds and financial industry credits.  ECM aims to return 8 to 10 percent annually, net of fees,
on its first investment vehicle for speculative-grade bonds in
Europe, the High Yield Fund. Andre Mazzella will be the lead
manager of the fund, with support from analyst Henry Craik- White, the London-based firm said in a statement today.  European Credit also started a 500 million-euro ($688
million) Financials Fund with targeted annual returns of
6 to 10 percent more than the euro interbank offered rate
after fees from 2011 to 2013, and 3 to 5 percent above Euribor
thereafter, it said in a separate statement.  “Significant value will be created for credit investors
over the next 10 years, as financial institutions, households
and governments deleverage their balance sheets as a long-term
response to the current financial crisis,” Head of Investments
Ross Pamphilon said in the statement.  The financials fund will be led by Satish Pulle, with
assistance from senior analyst Robert Montague and portfolio
manager Andy Li, European Credit said.  Both funds conform with  Europe ’s Undertakings for
Collective Investments in Transferable Securities, a type of
regulated fund format known as UCITS.  European Credit, founded in 1999, manages $12.5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
