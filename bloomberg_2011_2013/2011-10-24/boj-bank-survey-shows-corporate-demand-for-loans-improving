Japanese corporate demand for funds
improved, according to a  Bank of Japan (8301)  survey of loan officers
released today in  Tokyo .  An index for corporate demand was at zero in October
compared with minus 5 three months earlier, according to the
survey. The index subtracts the percentage of officers reporting
that demand is decreasing from those saying itâ€™s increasing. The
index for household loan demand was at minus 1 compared with the
previous minus 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
