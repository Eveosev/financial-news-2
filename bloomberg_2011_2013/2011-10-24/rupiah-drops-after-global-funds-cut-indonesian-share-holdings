Indonesia ’s rupiah fell for a third
day after global funds reduced holdings of the nation’s
equities.  International investors sold $34 million more local shares
than they bought on Oct. 21, according to exchange data. The
rupiah is under pressure to decline as importers are seeking
dollars ahead of the month-end, said Mika Martumpal, a currency
analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth.  “There was some outflow from equities,” said Jakarta-based
Martumpal.  The rupiah dropped 0.3 percent to 8,885 per dollar as of
9:10 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
complied by Bloomberg. The currency has fallen 1.1 percent this
month.  Bank Indonesia  is selling dollars when needed to ease
volatility in the currency, Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono said
on Oct. 7. The central bank will purchase  government bonds ,
Hendar, director of monetary policy who uses only one name, said
on Oct. 3.  The rupiah’s decline may be limited “as the central bank
is in the market to see the movement of the currency is
orderly,” Martumpal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
