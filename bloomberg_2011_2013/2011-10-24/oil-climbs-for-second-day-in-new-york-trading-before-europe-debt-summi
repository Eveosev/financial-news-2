Oil rose for a second day in  New
York  before European leaders meet this week to agree a blueprint
to tackle the region’s sovereign debt crisis.  Crude for December delivery was at $87.77 a barrel, up 37
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 11:19 a.m. Sydney time. The contract erased a decline of as
much as 0.5 percent. Futures rose 1.6 percent to $87.40 on Oct.
21, the highest close since Oct. 18.  European leaders yesterday ruled out tapping the  European
Central Bank ’s balance sheet to boost the region’s rescue fund
and outlined plans to aid banks. They won’t set out a complete
plan until a summit on Oct. 26.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
