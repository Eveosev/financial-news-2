Chinese banks may report “strong”
profit growth in the third quarter, according to Barclays Plc.  Hong Kong-listed Chinese lenders may post 32 percent profit
growth on average in the third quarter, led by China Minsheng
Banking Corp.,  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288)  and China Citic
Bank Corp.  “We believe the current share prices may reflect too
bearish a scenario for asset quality deterioration,” said
Barclays analysts May Yan and Shujin Chen in a report today.
“Negative news flow may have peaked.”  Positive catalysts in the next several months include more
central government measures to address local government debt
issue, a gradual decline in inflation and a resolution of the
European debt crisis, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
