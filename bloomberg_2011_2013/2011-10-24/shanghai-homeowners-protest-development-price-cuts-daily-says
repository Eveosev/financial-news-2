Hundreds of Shanghai homeowners
gathered outside sales offices of China Overseas Property Group
Co. over the weekend demanding refunds or cancellations of their
purchase contracts after the property company cut prices for one
of their new developments,  Shanghai Daily  reports today, citing
unidentified homeowners.  Prices for the project in Pudong district were reduced to
about 16,000 yuan per square meter from 22,000 yuan, according
to the newspaper.  Hong Kong-listed  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688)  owns
China Overseas Property Group, according to Bloomberg data and
stock exchange filings from 2005. Calls to Tang Minzhi, a media
department official at China Overseas Land, went unanswered
outside of business hours.  Home buyers also protested outside sales offices of two
other developers in Jiading district after  home prices  were
reduced by as much as 30 percent, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
