Norway ’s central bank will keep its
overnight deposit interest rate unchanged until December next
year as economic growth slows and inflation pressure subsides,
Svenska Handelsbanken AB said in a report published today.  Handelsbanken cut its 2012 growth forecast for Norway’s
mainland economy, which excludes oil, gas and shipping, to 1.8
percent. This compares with an April forecast of 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
