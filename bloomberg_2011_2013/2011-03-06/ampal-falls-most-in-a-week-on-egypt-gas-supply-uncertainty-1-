  Ampal-American Israel (AMPL)  Corp., the
owner of a 12.5 percent stake in East Mediterranean Gas Co.,
dropped the most in a week after the holding company said it is
“not clear” when gas flow from Egypt to  Israel  will resume.  Ampal lost 6.2 percent, the most since Feb. 27, to 6.592
shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  Minister of National Infrastructures Uzi Landau told Israel
Army Radio today he had “no idea” when the flow will restart.
Separately, Environment Minister Gilad Erdan told Army Radio he
doesn’t expect it to resume soon.  Recent political unrest in Egypt has led to concern Ampal
would have trouble meeting contractual obligations to Israeli
consumers. Egyptian natural gas exports to Israel and Jordan
were halted Feb. 5 after an explosion damaged a pipeline in the
Sinai Desert.  To contact the reporter on this story:
