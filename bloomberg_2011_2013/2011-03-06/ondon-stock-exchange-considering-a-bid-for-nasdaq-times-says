  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  is
considering making a takeover bid for  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) 
later this year after the U.K. market operator completes a
merger with Toronto Stock Exchange owner  TMX Group Inc. (X) , the
Sunday Times reported.  No talks have been held with Nasdaq, which failed in its
bid to buy LSE in 2006, the newspaper reported, without saying
where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
