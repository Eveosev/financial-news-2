  Israel â€™s budget deficit narrowed to
1.5 billion shekels in February, about half the amount recorded
a year earlier, as  tax revenue  surged.  The deficit reduced the surplus for the first two months of
the year to 2.8 billion shekels, compared with a surplus of
about 500 million shekels for the same period last year, the
 Finance Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement. For the 12
months through February, the deficit narrowed to 27.9 billion
shekels, from 29.5 billion shekels a month earlier, it said.  The Israel Tax Authority reported an increase in revenue of
about 15 percent in February, after accounting for changes in
tax laws, the statement said. In the first two months of the
year, revenue was 1.8 billion shekels above target, it said.  The government is aiming for a deficit of 25.2 billion
shekels in 2011, or about 3 percent of gross domestic product.
Last year, the government posted a budget deficit of about 3.7
percent of GDP, outperforming its original ceiling of 5.5
percent, as the economy grew by a faster-than-expected 4.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
