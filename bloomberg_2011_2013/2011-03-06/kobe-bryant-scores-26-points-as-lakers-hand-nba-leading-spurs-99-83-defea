Amar’e Stoudemire scored 26 points
as the  New York Knicks  beat the Atlanta Hawks 92-79, overcoming
Carmelo Anthony’s worst offensive performance since joining the
team two weeks ago.  Stoudemire had 10 points in the fourth quarter for the
Knicks (32-29), who used a 19-2 scoring run to break open a one-
point game yesterday in Atlanta and send the Hawks (37-26) to
their third loss in four games. Anthony finished with 14 points
on 6-of-18 shooting for New York, which was without starting
point guard Chauncey Billups because of a knee injury.  In matchups between National Basketball Association
division leaders, the Los Angeles Lakers routed the San Antonio
Spurs 99-83 and the  Chicago Bulls  beat Miami 87-86, dropping the
Heat to 1-9 this season against teams with a .700 winning
percentage or better.  “This is painful for every single one of us to go through
this,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said during a news conference.
“There are a couple guys crying in the locker room right now.”    Derrick Rose  scored 27 points in Miami for the Bulls, who
improved to 43-18 and moved past the Heat (43-20) into second
place in the Eastern Conference behind Boston, which is now
46-15 after beating the Milwaukee Bucks 89-83.    LeBron James  and  Dwyane Wade  each missed potential winning
shots in the final six seconds as the Heat dropped their fourth
straight game. Miami has missed 13 consecutive shots with a
chance to tie or take a lead in the final 10 seconds of
regulation or overtime.  James’s Vow  “I told the guys that I just keep failing them late in
games and I won’t continue to do that,” said James, who led the
Heat with 26 points.  The Lakers halted the Spurs’ franchise-record 22-game home
winning streak, racing to a 34-13 advantage after the opening
quarter and leading by as many as 32 points at AT&T Center in  San Antonio .  The Spurs had entered the game with an NBA-best 51-11
record, including a 29-2 mark at home. The Lakers improved to
45-19, the fifth-best record in the NBA and the third-best in
the Western Conference behind San Antonio and Dallas.  The game “was a good test to see how much we’ve improved
since the All-Star break and we passed,” Bryant, who added
seven rebounds and five assists, said in a televised interview.
“We’re not making as many mistakes as we were the first half of
the season. That’s a big difference.”    Pau Gasol  added 21 points for the Lakers, who won for the
first time in four games against their Western Conference rivals
by holding the Spurs’ five starters to a combined 29 points.  Tim Duncan  was limited to two points and  Manu Ginobili  scored six on
3-of-10 shooting.  The Spurs lost at home for the first time since Nov. 26.  The Mavericks (45-18) had an eight-game winning streak
snapped yesterday, losing to Memphis 104-103 at home as the
Grizzlies’ Zach Randolph hit a basket with 0.3 seconds left.  To contact the reporter on this story:
