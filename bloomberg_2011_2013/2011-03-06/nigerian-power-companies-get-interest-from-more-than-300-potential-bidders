  Nigeria ’s privatization agency said
331 applications were received by a March 4 deadline from groups
interested in buying state-owned power companies that are being
offered for sale.  The agency received “174 applications from prospective
investors and concessionaires interested in acquiring the four
thermal stations and the two hydro stations,” Chukwuma Nwokoh,
spokesman of the Bureau for Public Enterprises, or BPE, said in
an e-mailed statement today. A total of “157 applications were
harvested from prospective investors interested in acquiring the
11 distribution companies,” he said.  The government will offer incentives to investors
interested in acquiring the companies, including tax breaks for
five years, duty waivers and the ability to charge higher
electricity tariffs, the BPE said on Feb. 14.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s most populous nation and top oil
producer, plans to sell six state-owned transmission and 11
thermal-generation companies by July, Minister of State for
Power, Nuhu Wya, said in November. Power cuts occur daily in
Nigeria, where demand for electricity is almost double the
current supply of more than 3,000 megawatts. The government
wants to increase output to 14,019 megawatts by 2013.  President Goodluck Jonathan announced plans in August to
end the monopoly of state-owned Power Holding Co. of Nigeria and
open the industry to investment. The bureau held road shows in
Dubai and  London  in January and in  New York  and Johannesburg
last month to meet potential investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
