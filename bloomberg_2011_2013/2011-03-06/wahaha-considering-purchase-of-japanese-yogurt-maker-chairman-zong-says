Hangzhou Wahaha Group Chairman Zong Qinghou,  China ’s richest man, said he is considering buying a
Japanese yogurt maker.  The Japanese company recently approached Wahaha, China’s
third-biggest soft-drinks maker, about acquiring it, Zong said
at a briefing in Beijing, where he’s attending the annual
meetings of the National People’s Congress. Talks haven’t yet
started, he said, without giving more details.  Zong, whose wealth was estimated by Forbes at $8 billion
last year, has said he wants to buy foreign companies that
produce products China lacks and which Wahaha can then sell
domestically. The beverage maker, whose name means “laughing
child” in Chinese, aims to boost sales 27 percent this year to
70 billion yuan ($10.6 billion).  “We’ve learned a lot from Japan’s food and drinks sector
in the past because we have similar taste and Japan is more
advanced,” Zong said.  Wahaha, based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou,
accounts for 9.7 percent of China’s dairy market, the third-
largest share, according to data from Euromonitor International.
China Mengniu Dairy Co. has the biggest share with 19.5 percent
and  Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial (600887)  Group Co. has 15.7 percent,
according to Euromonitor.  Zong also said that Wahaha has decided not to invest in  Taiwan  as the island’s market isn’t large enough.  -  Michael Wei , Stephanie Wong, Tian Ying. Editors:  John Liu ,
