China should use economic and
administrative measures to curb the production and exports of
corn-based products including starch and alcohol, to guarantee
supply to livestock and poultry, China National Radio reported
on its website citing Bao Kexin, president of the China Grain
Reserves Corp.  China should next curb exports of meat, poultry and eggs
because their production worsens the country’s shortage of
farmland and fresh water, the radio said citing Bao.  China must also cut land losses to urbanization and
guarantee at least 1.8 billion mu of farmland, Bao was cited as
saying by the radio’s website report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
