The  Paris Club  group of creditor
nations rejected Argentina’s plan to pay its defaulted debt, La
Nacion reported, citing unidentified diplomatic officials.  The club didn’t accept the amount of the debt Argentina
offered to pay, the period of time to make the payments and the
interest rates it wanted to pay, the Buenos Aires-based
newspaper said, citing the unidentified officials.  Argentine Economy Minister  Amado Boudou  last month said the
country sought to reach an accord on a six-year payment plan, La
Nacion said.   Officials at the Paris Club in Paris weren’t immediately
available when Bloomberg News called for comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
