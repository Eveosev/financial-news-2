  Andy Roddick  gave the U.S. an
insurmountable 3-1 lead on its way to a 4-1 victory over Chile
in the Davis Cup, the premier team event in men’s tennis.  Roddick beat Paul Capdeville 3-6, 7-6 (7-2), 6-3, 6-3 at
the Estadio Nacional in Santiago, Chile, before John Isner
completed the tie with a 6-3, 6-7 (7-4), 7-5 win over Guillermo
Rivera-Aranguiz.  The victory was the first for U.S. team captain Jim Courier,
who played on the 1992 and 1995 Davis Cup-winning teams. Courier
took over in October from Patrick McEnroe, who won one title, in
2007, in 10 years as captain.  The U.S. win sets up a home quarterfinal against 2008 and
2009 champion  Spain , which beat Belgium 4-1. Defending champion
Serbia overcame India 4-1 to advance to a round of eight tie
against Sweden, which won the last of its seven titles in 1998.
Sweden ousted Russia 3-2.  The Davis Cup is the largest annual international men’s
tennis tournament. The U.S. has won a record 32 titles.  Serbia advanced without  Novak Djokovic , the world’s third-
ranked player and 2011 Australian Open winner.  Kazakhstan plays Argentina and  Germany  faces 2010 finalist
France in the other quarterfinals, which will be played July 8-
10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
