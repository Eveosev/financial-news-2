The  Swiss People’s Party  plans to
file a motion in parliament calling for the Swiss central bank
to be subjected to “disciplinary supervision” by the
government or legislature,  SonntagsZeitung  reported, citing
Deputy Chairman Christoph Blocher in an interview.  The curb on the  Swiss National Bank ’s autonomy would apply
to decisions going beyond its core mandate of defending price
stability, Blocher said according to the Zurich-based newspaper.  This should prevent the SNB from taking “incredible
risks” such as spending “one-third of its reserves within a
year” to limit the Swiss franc’s gains against the euro,
Blocher was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
