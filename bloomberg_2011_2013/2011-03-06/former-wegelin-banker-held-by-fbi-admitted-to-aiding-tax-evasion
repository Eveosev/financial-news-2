A former director of  Wegelin & Co AG 
was held by the FBI in the U.S., where he admitted to money-
laundering charges, the Swiss private bank said.  Wegelin spokeswoman Albena Bjoerck confirmed a report in
 SonntagsZeitung  saying the 41-year-old was arrested at Miami
airport in October 2010 and later convicted. He returned to  Switzerland  on Oct. 27 and the bank fired him in late February,
the paper said.  “The bank regrets the incident,” Bjoerck told Bloomberg
News in an e-mailed statement. “Wegelin is examining the case
comprehensively in close cooperation with the authorities.”  The director, who until 2005 headed the Caribbean business
of another Swiss bank, was incriminated using camera footage
gathered secretly in  London  by U.K. police and the FBI, the
paper said.  Though he knew that travel to the U.S. was risky, the
banker was lured there with a promise of “exciting business
contacts” by a business partner’s wife who was working with the
FBI, the report said.  The banker confirmed the arrest in the newspaper and said
his case is now closed, SonntagsZeitung said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
