  Germany  could agree to an extension
of the repayment of European Union loans to Greece provided
private creditors also agree to an extension, Lars Feld, an
adviser to Chancellor Angela Merkel, was quoted as saying by
Real News in an interview.  Feld said Greece should actively pursue a strategy in which
other creditors extend the maturities of Greek sovereign bonds,
the  Athens-based newspaper  reported today. Germany won’t agree
to reduce  interest rates  on the loans under the EU-led 110
billion-euro bailout ($153 billion) as Greece has already
received relatively favorable terms, Feld was cited as saying.  Markets will appreciate a longer repayment time, the
newspaper quoted Feld as saying. Greece leaving the euro and
adopting the drachma isn’t an option, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
