  Anglo American Plc (AGL) , Africa’s largest
mining company, should become 60 percent owned by the South
African state, Johannesburg-based  City Press  reported, citing
Julius Malema, the leader of the ruling African National
Congress’s youth wing.  Malema has spear-headed a debate within the ANC about the
nationalization of mines in the country, which has the world’s
biggest mineral reserves. He has threatened to withdraw support
for ANC leaders who do not endorse the policy.  Anglo spokesman Pranill Ramchander said the company would
not comment on report, when contacted on his mobile phone today.
The mining company has contributed 60 billion rand ($8.7
billion) in black economic empowerment transactions in South
Africa, he said later by text message.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Franz Wild  in Johannesburg at
