  Germany ’s main business associations
backed Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s rejection of joint euro bonds
and her push to make other European countries adopt
constitutional debt limits.  “The European Stability Mechanism must not open the back
door to the creation of common debt,” which would overburden
even “strong countries” in the euro region, the BDI industry
federation in Berlin and three other groups said today in a
joint statement.  The BDI, the BDA employers’ federation, the DIHK chamber of
commerce and the ZDH skilled-crafts group endorsed Merkel’s
stand as European Union leaders prepare for March 11 and March
24-25 summits on ways to end the debt crisis. Agreeing on the
stability mechanism, which will take over from the current
bailout fund in 2013, is on the agenda for the talks.  Debt-strapped euro countries should get aid only if they
agree to “stringent consolidation and reform,” and state
insolvency with losses for sovereign bondholders should be an
option under the mechanism, the groups said. Sanctions against
debt and deficit violators should be as independent of political
pressures as possible, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
