World Boxing Association heavyweight
champion David Haye agreed to fight Wladimir Klitschko, holder
of two other versions of the title, in  Germany  on June 25 or
July 2, the  British Broadcasting Corp.  reported.  After months of wrangling between the two men over the
staging of the contest, Haye told the broadcaster an agreement
was reached on the dates last night.  “I finally had a contract in front of me and couldn’t wait
to put pen to paper,” the Briton was cited as saying. “It’s
the fight every boxing fan has to see.”  Klitschko, a Germany-based Ukrainian, holds the
International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Organization
heavyweight crowns, so three titles will be at stake. A lengthy
recovery from a stomach-muscle injury was given as the reason
for Klitschko’s withdrawal yesterday from an April 30 matchup
with Britain’s Dereck Chisora, the  BBC  added.  “The terms were right, it’s a fair deal,” Haye said of
the Klitschko fight. “It’s a 50-50 split, that’s what they
wanted and that’s what I wanted.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
