  Manchester United  manager  Alex Ferguson  plans to spend more than 100 million pounds ($162
million) to revitalize his squad at the end of the season, the
 Sunday Express reported .  The 69-year-old wants to ensure he leaves the 18-time
English soccer champion in a healthy state for whenever he
retires and has targeted six major signings, the newspaper said.  United will offer 30 million pounds for Tottenham winger
Gareth Bale, while Aston Villa’s Ashley Young is set to sign for
20 million pounds, the Express reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Sunderland’s Jordan Henderson, Everton’s Jack Rodwell and
Southampton winger Alex Chamberlain are also targets, while
Ferguson will spend over 10 million pounds on a goalkeeper to
replace Edwin van der Sar, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  James Cone  in London at
