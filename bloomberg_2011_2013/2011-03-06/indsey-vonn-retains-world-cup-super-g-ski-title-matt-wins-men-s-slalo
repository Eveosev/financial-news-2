  Lindsey Vonn  of the U.S. claimed the
women’s World Cup super-G title for a third straight year after
winning today’s race in Tarvisio, Italy.  The 26-year-old had already taken this season’s super-
combined title on March 4, and yesterday secured the downhill
title for a fourth consecutive year. Vonn now trails Germany’s
Maria Riesch by only 96 points in the overall competition
standings. A win earns 100 points.  Vonn clocked 1 minute, 21.75 seconds today to take her 41st
World Cup victory, 0.23 second ahead of countrywoman Julia Mancuso, with Riesch in third. Through six of seven super-G
races Vonn has an unbeatable 171-point lead.  Riesch leads the overall competition with 1,676 points, and
Vonn has 1,580, with Slovenia’s Tina Maze and Elisabeth Goergl
of  Austria  trailing on 893 points.  Elsewhere, Austria’s Mario Matt, 31, won today’s men’s
slalom race in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, with Sweden’s Axel Baeck
and Nolan Kasper of the U.S. tied for second.  Ivica Kostelic of Croatia failed to score a point and now
leads the discipline standings  by only 36 points  from France’s
Jean-Baptiste Grange with one race remaining. The Croatian has a
582-point advantage in the overall competition. Didier Cuche of
Switzerland is second, with Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal three
points further back.  To contact the reporter on this story:  James Cone  in London at
