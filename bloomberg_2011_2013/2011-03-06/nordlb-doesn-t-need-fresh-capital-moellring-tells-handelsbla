Norddeutsche Landesbank doesn’t need
outside capital to meet increased capital and liquidity
requirements under the Basel III rules, Handelsblatt quoted
supervisory board head Hartmut Moellring as saying.  The Hanover, Germany-based bank’s shareholders are in talks
to turn a 1.4 billion-euro ($1.96 billion) so-called silent
participation by the state of  Lower Saxony  into core capital,
the  newspaper  quoted Moellring as saying in an interview to be
published tomorrow. Moellring also is the state’s finance
minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
