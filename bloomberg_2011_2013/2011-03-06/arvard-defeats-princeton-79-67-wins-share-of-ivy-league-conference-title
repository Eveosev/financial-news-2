  Harvard University  defeated
Princeton University 79-67 to gain a share of its first Ivy
League Conference title and a chance for its first National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament berth since 1946.  The Crimson will hold the college basketball title outright
if Princeton loses to the  University of Pennsylvania  (12-14, 5-5
Ivy) in its final regular-season game on March 8. If the Tigers
win, they will force a one-game playoff with Harvard for the
automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.  Kyle Casey scored 24 points for Harvard (23-5, 12-2 Ivy),
while Oliver McNally added 15 tonight at Lavietes Pavilion in  Boston .  Dan Mavraides had 25 points for the Tigers (23-6, 11-2
Ivy), whose last Ivy League title and NCAA tournament berth came
in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
