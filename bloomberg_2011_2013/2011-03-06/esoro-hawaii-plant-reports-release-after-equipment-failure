  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) , the largest
independent refiner on the U.S. West Coast, released sulfur
dioxide March 4 at its refinery in Kapolei,  Hawaii , after an
equipment failure in a compressor, according to a filing.  The company said it would release between 500 and 1,500
pounds of the gas by flaring it to the atmosphere, according to
the filing with the National Response Center. The problem
occurred at 2:30 p.m. Hawaiian time and was expected to be fixed
within 24 hours.  U.S. refineries must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  The refinery has a capacity of 93,500 barrels of crude oil
a day, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Mike Lee  in Dallas at
