  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  hired Sara
Bradley to take a “senior role” in its clothing business weeks
before she was set to start at Asda, the Financial Mail on
Sunday reported, citing unidentified sources.  Bradley, previously the head of clothing at Sainsbury’s
Plc, had been weeks away from starting at Asda after agreeing in
November to join its George business, the Mail said. She was
expected to take control of its men’s clothing division and the
children’s wear business, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
