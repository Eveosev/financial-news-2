renewal of his mandate,  La Stampa  reported, citing bankers
attending the meeting.  Bondi held a meeting with investors including Fidelity,
Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA’s funds and Global  Wealth
Management , according to the newspaper. He argued he should be

of its business plan, it said.  A group of Parmalat investors is preparing a list of joint
nominations to the board in an effort to pump up sales and
improve earnings growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
