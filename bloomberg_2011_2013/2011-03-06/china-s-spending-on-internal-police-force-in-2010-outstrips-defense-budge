  China  spent more on its internal
police force than on its armed forces in 2010, and plans to do
the same this year, as the government deployed security forces
around the country to control growing social unrest.  China spent 548.6 billion yuan ($83.5 billion) on internal
security last year, 6.7 percent more than budgeted and a 15.6
percent increase over 2009, the Finance Ministry said in a
report released yesterday. Last year China spent 533.5 billion
yuan on national defense, or 0.3 percent more than budgeted,
according to the Finance Ministry.  The surge in public security spending comes as so-called
mass incidents, everything from strikes to riots and
demonstrations, are on the rise. There were at least 180,000
such incidents in 2010, twice as many as in 2006, Sun Liping, a
professor of sociology at Beijing’s Tsinghua University, said in
a Feb. 25 article in the Economic Observer.  Zhou Yongkang, a member of the Communist Party’s ruling
Politburo Standing Committee who oversees the country’s security
forces, said in a Feb. 21 article in the People’s Daily, the
party’s official mouthpiece, that the government must “defuse
social conflicts and disputes just as they germinate.”  This year, the government plans to spend 624.4 billion yuan
on public security, a 13.8 percent increase from 2010, and 601.2
billion yuan on defense, a 12.7 percent increase, according to
the  Finance Ministry . The announcement comes days after hundreds
of police deployed in cities across the country following an
online call for rallies inspired by uprisings in the Middle
East.  Like national defense, China spends less on its police than
the U.S. Federal, state and local governments  spent  a combined
$213.7 billion on police, prisons and the judicial system in
2005, the last year figures are available, according to the
Bureau of Justice Statistics of the  Department of Justice .  U.S. spending on the justice system in 2005 was 1.7 percent
of that year’s gross domestic product. China’s announced 2010
spending on public safety was 1.4 percent of 2010 GDP.  --Michael Forsythe. Editor: Peter Hirschberg, Paul Panckhurst  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
