Plaxico Burress, the former  New York 
Giants wide receiver who was sentenced to prison after he
accidentally shot himself in the leg at a  Manhattan  nightclub,
will be released June 6, said Benjamin Brafman, his attorney.  Burress, 33, was sentenced to two years in prison after he
pleaded guilty Aug. 20, 2009, to a state charge of attempted
possession of a weapon. He will be released three months early
for good behavior from the medium-security Oneida Correctional
Facility in Rome, New York, and then be under two years’
supervision.  “That is the date set for his release,” Brafman, a
partner in the New York firm of Brafman & Associates PC, said in
an e-mail.  Upon his release date, Burress will be eligible to return
to the  National Football League , Commissioner Roger Goodell said
when he suspended the player after his guilty plea.  Burress carried a Glock semiautomatic pistol in the
waistband of his jeans and shot himself Nov. 28, 2008, in the
Latin Quarter club in Manhattan. The bullet went through his leg,
just missing a security guard, prosecutors said.  The wide receiver was dropped by the Giants on April 3,
2009, seven months after he signed a five-year, $35 million
extension. He led the Giants with 70 catches for 1,025 yards
during the 2007-08 season, playing most games with an ankle
injury.  Burress ended that season by catching a 13-yard touchdown
pass from quarterback Eli Manning in the final 35 seconds of the  Super Bowl  to give the Giants a 17-14 victory over the  New
England Patriots  on Feb. 3, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
