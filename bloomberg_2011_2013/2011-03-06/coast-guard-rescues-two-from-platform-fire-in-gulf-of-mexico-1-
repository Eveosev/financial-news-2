The U.S. Coast Guard said it rescued
two workers after an oil platform fire in the  Gulf of Mexico ,
about 50 miles (80 kilometers) off the coast of  Grand Isle ,
Louisiana.  The fire is out at the platform in Grand Isle Block 115 and
an investigation into the cause is underway, the agency said in
a statement.  The platform was shut two weeks ago and was not producing
at the time of the blaze, the Coast Guard said.  The two workers who were rescued were the only people
aboard the platform at the time of the fire, Petty Officer Steve
Lehmann said.  The investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Bureau of
Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, Lehmann
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
