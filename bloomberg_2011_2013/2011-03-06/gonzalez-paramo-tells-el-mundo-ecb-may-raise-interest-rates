European Central Bank Executive
Board Member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said it’s “possible”
policymakers will raise  interest rates  for the single currency
area when they meet next month, El Mundo reported.  “The message is that it is possible, and the ECB considers
it necessary to maintain strong vigilance,” Gonzalez-Paramo
said in an interview with the  newspaper . “The message should be
read as a sign of confidence, the ECB hasn’t forgotten its
mission to control inflation.”  Gonzalez-Paramo said the central bank can’t wait until
economies that are still struggling to grow recover as this
would risk fueling inflation, according to El Mundo.  Still, markets understand that the economic changes that  Spain  introduced are “very positive,” the newspaper said,
citing the policy maker.  Gonzalez-Paramo said the European Union rescue fund should
be large, flexible and effective enough to act as a deterrent
and should be able to buy bonds while imposing tough terms on
borrowers, according to the newspaper, El Mundo said.  “Turning to the fund shouldn’t be an attractive option,”
he was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
