A coalition government between Fine
Gael and the  Labour Party  in Ireland will keep to fiscal targets
laid down in the European Union-led bailout,  RTE  reported,
citing an interview with Fine Gael spokesman Phil Hogan.  “We will see very strong fiscal policy in the document
which ties us into the parameters laid down by the EU-IMF,
notwithstanding the fact that we want to see that
renegotiated,” Hogan told RTE.  To contact the reporters on this story:
