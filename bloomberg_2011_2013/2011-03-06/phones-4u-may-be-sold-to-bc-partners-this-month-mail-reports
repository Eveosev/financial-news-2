end of the month to private equity firm  BC Partners  Ltd., the 
Mail on Sunday reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  “Revitalized” talks put the price tag closer to 650

considered when the mobile phones company was put up for sale
last year, the Mail said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
