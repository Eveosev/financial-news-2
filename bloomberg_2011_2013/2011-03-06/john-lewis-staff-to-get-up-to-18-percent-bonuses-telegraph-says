John Lewis Partnership Plc will
award its employees bonuses of between 16 and 18 percent of
their annual salary when it publishes a rise in pretax profits
on Wednesday, the Sunday Telegraph  reported , without saying
where it got the information.  The payout will apply to staff at Waitrose and John Lewis
stores and would be the largest since they received a 20 percent
bonus in 2008. Analysts expect the employee-owned company to
report profit of 352 million pounds ($573 million), a 15 percent
increase from last year, the Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
