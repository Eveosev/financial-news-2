The executive director of the
sovereign-wealth fund, Government of Singapore Investment Corp.,
Tony Tan Keng Yam, said in an interview that Americans “don’t
see the potential in their own economy,” the Wall Street
Journal reported. Tan told the Journal he expects the  U.S.
economy  to grow at between 4 percent and 4.5 percent in 2011.
That would outpace the 3.3 percent growth forecast by economists
surveyed by the newspaper.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
