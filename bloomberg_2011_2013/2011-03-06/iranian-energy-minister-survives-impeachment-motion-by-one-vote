Iranian Energy Minister Majid Namjou
survived by one vote an attempt to remove him from office for
having a “poor record,” state-run  Press TV  reported.  In parliament, 102 lawmakers voted for the minister while
101 voted against, Press TV said.  The ballot follows parliament’s Feb. 1 dismissal of Roads
and Transportation Minister Hamid Behbahani. Lawmakers had
blamed him for failing to improve road and air safety.  To contact the reporter on this story:
