  Germany  may need to revive its bank-
rescue fund to help any bank that fails European Union stress
tests, the  Welt am Sonntag  said, citing members of  Chancellor
Angela Merkel ’s governing coalition it didn’t identify.  The  Finance Ministry  said it isn’t seeking to reauthorize
the 480 billion-euro ($671 billion) fund, known as Soffin, which
was set up by the government in 2008 at the height of the
financial crisis and closed Dec. 31.  “No such thing is under consideration,” ministry
spokeswoman Jeanette Schwamberger said in a phone interview.
“Our basic view is that it’s up to the owners of the  credit
institutions  to provide for an adequate capital base.”  German banks are concerned that their holdings of sovereign
bonds of countries such as  Greece , Portugal, Ireland and  Spain 
will weigh on their stress-test scores, the newspaper reported
today, without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
