  Sudan ’s Central Bank Governor Sabir
Hassan resigned from his position for age reasons, the Khartoum-
based bank said, four months ahead of the secession of the oil-
producing country’s south.  Hassan, 65, submitted his resignation in December, asking
for his contract not to be renewed beyond March 7, the bank said
today in an e-mailed statement. It denied reports the governor
is leaving because of differences within the economic team.  Hassan was a lobbyist for the need to diversify the
Sudanese economy and to reduce its dependence on oil. He served
as the central bank’s governor for a total of 16 years starting
in 1993, according to the statement. He was a state minister of
finance between 1996 and 1998, it said.  About two thirds of Sudan’s daily crude production of
490,000 barrels per day is pumped in  Southern Sudan , which is
scheduled to secede and become an independent nation in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
