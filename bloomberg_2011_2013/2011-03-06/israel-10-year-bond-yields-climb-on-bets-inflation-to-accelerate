  Israel ’s 10-year government bonds
dropped for a fourth day as higher tax revenue in February
boosted speculation that inflation will accelerate, leading to a
faster pace of interest-rate increases.  Tax revenue climbed about 15 percent in February, after
accounting for changes in tax laws, to 17.1 billion shekels
($4.7 billion), the Israel Tax Authority said today. In the
first two months of the year, revenue was 1.8 billion shekels
above target, it said in an e-mailed statement.  “The increase in government revenue from taxes is another
sign pointing to high demand and strong growth in the economy
while unemployment is low,” said Rafael Gozlan, chief economist
at Leader Capital Markets Ltd. in  Tel Aviv . “In the current
economic environment, the data adds to the factors fueling
inflation, demanding faster rate hikes."  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 fell,
pushing the yield up 3 basis points to 5.2 percent at the 4:30
p.m. close in Tel Aviv, the highest level since January 2010.  ‘‘The pressure on yields can be expected to continue its
upward trend as inflationary pressures are high,’’ Gozlan said.  The signal from the  European Central Bank  on March 3 that
it may increase  interest rates  next month ‘‘will accelerate the
speed of hikes by the  Bank of Israel  to control inflation,’’ he
added.  The shekel weakened 0.4 percent to 3.6239 against the
dollar in Tel Aviv on March 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
