Rory Sabbatini won golf’s Honda
Classic by one stroke over former champion Y.E. Yang for his
sixth victory on the U.S.  PGA Tour  and first since 2009.  Sabbatini, 34, carried a five-shot lead into the final
round and scored an even-par 70 at PGA National Resort & Spa’s
Champion Course in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Sabbatini
finished at 9-under par for the tournament, having taken the
lead by shooting 64-66 during the second and third rounds.    South Africa ’s Sabbatini, who began the tournament 102nd in
the  Official World Golf Ranking , receives $1 million for his
first PGA Tour win since the Byron Nelson Championship in May
2009.  Yang, who in 2009 won the Honda Championship and  PGA
Championship , closed with a 4-under 66 that included three
birdies over his final six holes. He sank a 9-foot birdie putt
at the par-5 18th hole before Sabbatini tapped in for a par that
clinched the victory.  Jerry Kelly finished third at 7-under, with Ricky Barnes
three shots further back in fourth place and Tommy Gainey in
fifth at 3-under. Graeme McDowell, who’s ranked fourth in the
world, tied the course record with a final-round 64 to finish in
a tie for sixth place at 2-under.  To contact the reporter on this story:
