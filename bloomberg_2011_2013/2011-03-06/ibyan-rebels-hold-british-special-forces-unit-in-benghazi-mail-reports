Libyan rebel forces captured an
eight-member British special forces unit in Benghazi, the Daily
Mail reported on its website, without saying where it obtained
the information.  The unit was captured as it accompanied a British diplomat
on an undercover mission to try and lead the way for a more
senior official to establish diplomatic relations with the
rebels, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
