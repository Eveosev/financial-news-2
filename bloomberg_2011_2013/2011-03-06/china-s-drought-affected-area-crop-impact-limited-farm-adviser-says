The total area in  China  affected by
drought is “limited” and grain prices will remain “basically
stable,” said Chen Xiwen, the State Council’s deputy director
of agricultural affairs.  Winter wheat only accounts for 22 percent of China’s total
grain output and even at the height of the drought only a third
of the crops was affected, said Chen, who was speaking at a new
conference at the meeting of the National People’s Congress in
Beijing.  After rains and irrigation conditions have been relieved
further, the impact can be “minimized,” Chen said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
