  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  Chief Executive
Officer Reto Francioni indicated he may seek an Asia partner now
that the operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange has agreed to
buy New York Stock Exchange parent  NYSE Euronext (NYX) , Handelsblatt
reported, citing an interview.  “We can’t change American culture and the Americans can’t
change our culture,” the newspaper quoted Francioni as saying.
“So this is about coexistence. And I’ll tell you something
else: Maybe Asian culture will also be added to the mix.”  Francioni didn’t elaborate on the comment, according to the
text of the interview provided by  Handelsblatt  in advance of
publication tomorrow.  A name hasn’t been set yet for the combined U.S.-German
company and employees have been asked to propose ideas,
Francioni also said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
