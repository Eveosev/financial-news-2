Oil rose to the highest in 29 months
in  New York  as escalating violence in Libya renewed concern that
supply disruptions may spread through the Middle East.  Crude gained as much as 2.4 percent after fighting between
Libyan rebels and troops loyal to Muammar Qaddafi intensified.  Hedge funds  raised purchases of futures to an all-time high for
a second week on speculation cuts will continue. Citigroup Inc.
increased its Brent oil price estimate, saying the threat of
more output disruptions supports a “fear premium.”  “High  oil prices  will be sustained over the coming days
and weeks because there’s lots of uncertainty about how the
situation in the Middle East will develop,” said  Sintje Diek ,
an analyst at  HSH Nordbank  in Hamburg. “We do not know if riots
will spill over to huge oil producers such as Saudi Arabia.
There’s no quick solution to this situation.”  Crude for April delivery increased as much as $2.53 to
$106.6 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest price since Sept. 26, 2008. The contract
was at $106.50 at 1:41 p.m. London time. Futures on Nymex rose
6.7 percent last week and are up 30 percent from a year ago.  Brent crude  for April settlement gained as much as $2.53, or 2.2
percent, to $118.50 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The contract jumped 3.4 percent last week, the
sixth weekly increase.  Turmoil in the Middle East also pushed oil products prices
higher. Gasoline for April delivery gained 4.72 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $3.0936 a gallon on the Nymex after advancing 11
percent last week.  Forecasts Raised  Citigroup raised its Brent price estimate for 2011 to $105
a barrel from $90 and for next year to $100, according to a
report by analysts including Mark Fletcher. Commerzbank AG
boosted its forecast for Brent in the second quarter to $120 a
barrel, citing the risk of Middle East supply disruptions.  Violence in  Libya  has cut output in the North African
country by as much as 1 million barrels a day, according to the  International Energy Agency . Libya pumped 1.59 million barrels a
day in January, Bloomberg News estimates show.  Hedge funds and other large speculators increased net-long
positions amid the turmoil. Wagers on higher prices increased by
27 percent in the seven days ended March 1 to 305,408 futures
and options, the most in records dating back to June 2006,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s weekly
Commitments of Traders report. The total has jumped 65 percent
since Feb. 15.  ‘Day of Rage’  Options traders are betting more than ever that crude oil
is heading to $200 a barrel amid worsening civil unrest in the
Middle East. Open interest, or the number of outstanding
contracts, for “call” options to buy New York crude for June
delivery at $200 a barrel has escalated to the highest since the
options started trading in July 2009.  Demonstrations have toppled leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt ,
while there have been protests in countries including Iran,
Yemen and Oman. In  Saudi Arabia , the biggest oil producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, websites have
called for a nationwide “Day of Rage” on March 11 and March
20, according to Human Rights Watch.  “We’re hearing increasing calls for protest in Saudi
Arabia, which is the big, great threat hanging over the oil
market at the moment,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy
economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in  Melbourne .  Oil in New York on March 4 settled above a price observed
by technical analysts as a point from which the rally may
continue. This level, at $103.39 a barrel, represents the so-
called 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop to $32.40
in December 2008 from a record high of $147.27 in July that
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The next
retracement level is $120.16.  “It’s easy for oil today to go up $10 at a time,” said  Ken Hasegawa , an energy trading manager at broker Newedge in
Tokyo. “Once Brent gets to $120 it could go to $130.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
