Budget cuts in the federal funding
for security are “dangerous,”  Peter King , the Republican
chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said.  “A number of the cuts Republicans have made in the
continuing resolution are wrong,” King said today on CNN’s
“State of the Union” program. “We cannot afford those cuts,
they are too dangerous, and one attack on a subway train or one
attack in one port will cost us more money going into the future
years than any amount, any small amount they’re saving.”  President  Barack Obama  signed a two-week stopgap measure on
March 2 that cut spending by $4 billion while funding most of
the government at current budget until March 18. That leaves
lawmakers less than two weeks to decide on funding for the rest
of the 2011 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, or risk a
government shutdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
