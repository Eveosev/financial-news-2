  Sheldon Adelson , Chairman of Las
Vegas Sands Corp., may build a 15 billion-euro ($21 billion)
gambling resort in Spain, the country’s biggest ever private
investment, if he can persuade the government to ease labor
rules,  El Mundo  reported.  “Spain is the ideal country for it,” the newspaper cited
Adelson as saying. “But I’m worried about the current Spanish  labor laws . They are so rigid.”  Adelson said he has already met with politicians and
executives in Madrid and Barcelona to discuss the plan which
would involve a dozen casino-hotels lined up on a Las Vegas-
style strip, El Mundo added.  Adelson said he may need to wait for a new Spanish
government to be in place before he can complete a deal,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
