Serbian Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic  tonight stopped short of naming members of a downsized
cabinet and provided only the structure of the government, as he
tries to avert early elections and have the governing coalition
be the first in a decade to last for its full term.  Cvetkovicâ€™s new cabinet, which needs parliamentary
approval, will have 17 ministries, down from 24, and 21 members
of the government, the government said in an e-mailed statement.  The government will keep the  finance ministry  as an
individual portfolio, while merging the ministries of trade and
agriculture and the ministries of energy and infrastructure. The
government is also merging the mining portfolio with the
environment ministry.  The government, the longest-serving since the fall of  Slobodan Milosevic  in 2000, is struggling to stay in power after
clashing with Mladjan Dinkic, the leader of the junior coalition
party G17 Plus. Last month, Cvetkovic ousted Dinkic, his former
deputy, raising the risk of a government collapse and early
elections.  The next general elections are scheduled for 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
