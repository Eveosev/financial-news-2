Japan’s sale of 1.2 trillion yen
($12.8 billion) in 20-year bonds may have a lowest-accepted
price of 100.65, according to the median forecast of 13 traders
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 1.8 percent
bonds ranged from 100.55 to 100.70, according to the survey.  Nine traders said 100.65, two traders said 100.55, and one
each said 100.60 and 100.70.  The lowest-accepted price is the minimum at which the
government sells the securities. The Ministry of Finance will
