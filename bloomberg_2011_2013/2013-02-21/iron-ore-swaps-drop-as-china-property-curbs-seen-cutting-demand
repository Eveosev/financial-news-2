Iron-ore swaps dropped the most in
almost six weeks alongside declines in steel futures and
equities on speculation China’s call for real-estate curbs would
curb demand for the commodity used in construction materials.  The March contract tumbled 2.6 percent to $148.50 a dry
metric ton as of 8:26 a.m. in London, according to GFI Group
Inc. It headed for the biggest decline since Jan. 11, based on
data from SGX AsiaClear, the largest clearer of the derivatives
used to hedge prices and bet on Chinese growth.  Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  urged local authorities to
“decisively” curb real-estate speculation and take steps to
rein in the  property market . October contracts for steel
reinforcement bars used in construction fell as much as 3.2
percent to 4,048  yuan  ($648) a ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities lost 0.9
percent at 10:14 a.m. in London and the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
Index of 24 raw materials retreated 0.9 percent.  “The government wants to control housing costs, so there
will be less property speculators and demand,” Peter Cho, an
iron-ore derivatives broker at ICAP Energy Ltd. in  Singapore ,
said by e-mail today. “Sentiment finally turned. Physical
traders are no longer holding in hopes of higher prices.”  Ore with 62 percent content at the Chinese port of Tianjin,
a  global benchmark , surged 83 percent to $158.90 a ton since an
almost three-year low on Sept. 5, according to The Steel Index
Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
