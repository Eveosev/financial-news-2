Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
tightened to the smallest level in more than a week as plants
idled and prices for the motor fuel sank for a third day.  The spread narrowed 0.8 cent to 68.65 cents a gallon, the
least since Feb. 13.  Biofuel Energy Corp. (BIOF) , partially owned by
venture capitalists  David Einhorn  and  Daniel Loeb , said
yesterday it would keep a closed ethanol mill in Fairmont,
 Minnesota , shut until this year’s corn harvest.  “With all the plants down,” ethanol is “going to hold
strong,” said Michael Slider, director of biofuels at Elgin,
Iowa-based Fauser Energy Resources.  Denatured ethanol for March delivery fell 1.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.35 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Futures have advanced 7.3 percent this year.  Gasoline for March delivery decreased 2.3 cents, or, 0.8
percent, to $3.0365 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , extending the longest streak of declines since Dec. 6.  At least 19 ethanol plants have shut since June to stem
losses from higher corn prices following a drought and to help
reduce a glut of the biofuel, according to the  Renewable Fuels
Association  in  Washington .  Corn for March delivery slipped 9.75 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $6.9075 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol. Corn futures rose to a record $8.49 a bushel
in August as drought in the Midwest cut yields.  Crush Spread  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, was minus 16 cents,
compared with minus 18 cents yesterday. The amount doesn’t
include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  Ethanol  production  in the week ended Feb. 15 rose 1 percent
to 797,000 barrels a day, a 17 percent decline from a record
963,000 barrels a day in December 2011, a report from the Energy
Information Administration, the Energy Department’s analytical
arm, showed today.  Slider said output won’t climb much higher until after the
corn harvest in September, when profit may improve.  Stockpiles were little changed at 19.5 million barrels, the
report showed, while imports almost doubled to 21,000 barrels a
day from the previous week.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.38 a gallon last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, more expensive than
today’s futures price.  Gasoline Pool  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 90 percent of the
total gasoline pool, up from 89 percent, the EIA said.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, jumped 38 percent to 47 cents today from 34 cents
yesterday for the  conventional sort , Starfuels Inc., an ethanol
broker in Jupiter,  Florida , said today.  RINs are credits that help the government track whether
refiners are meeting federal biofuel use mandates. End-users of
the fuel may be concerned that gasoline demand and production of
the biofuel aren’t robust enough to meet the targets and may be
buying the RINs to satisfy their obligations, said Jerrod Kitt,
an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York added 0.5 cent
to $2.46 a gallon, while in Chicago the biofuel slipped 0.75
cent to $2.355, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The additive
was unchanged in the U.S. Gulf at $2.405 and prices on the West
Coast fell 0.5 cent to $2.52 a gallon.  New York  Harbor’s premium to ethanol in Chicago expanded to
10.5 cents, the highest in a week, while the biofuel on the West
Coast, the most expensive region in the nation, was 11.5 cents
more costly than in the Gulf, the smallest gap since Feb. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
