Nigeria ’s Eurobond yields fell to
the lowest in more than a week as investors placed orders for
more than four times the amount of Treasury bills offered at an
auction.  Yield on the $500 million of debt due January 2021 declined
eight basis points to 4.351 percent as of 3:45 p.m. in  London ,
the lowest on a closing basis since Feb. 13, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The naira gained less than 0.1 percent to
157.25 a dollar.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold 135.65 billion naira ($862
million) of bills yesterday, including 25.65 billion naira of
91-day bills at a yield of 9.416 percent, it said today in an e-
mailed statement, the lowest since September 2011. Bids amounted
to 529.94 billion naira. The nation’s  inflation  rate fell to 9
percent in January from 12 percent in December, the statistics
bureau said Feb. 18.  “Favourable outlook of the economy has been reflected in
rising local and offshore interest in various debt securities of
the country,” Kunle Ezun, a Lagos-based analyst at Ecobank
Transnational Inc., said in a telephone interview today.  The  foreign-currency reserves  of  Africa ’s most populous
country have advanced 6 percent this year to $46.9 billion, the

by the central bank.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 rose eight basis points to 10.48 percent, according
to today’s data compiled on the  Financial Markets Dealers
Association  website.  Ghana ’s cedi declined 0.2 percent to 1.9085 per dollar in
