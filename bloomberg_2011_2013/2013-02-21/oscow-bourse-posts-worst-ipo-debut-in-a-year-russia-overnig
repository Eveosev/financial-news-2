The Moscow Exchange had the worst
debut in a year among Russian companies that held initial share
sales after oil, the nation’s biggest export earner, sank.  Shares of the bourse have lost 1.1 percent to 54.42 rubles
in Moscow since pricing at 55 rubles in the Feb. 15 initial
public offering. The exchange posted the steepest first-week
decline of any Russian company that sold more than $10 million
in an IPO since oil producer  RusPetro Plc (RPO) ’s 4 percent slump last
January, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The IPO of Russia’s main stock and fixed-income exchange,
the biggest in Moscow since 2007, came three trading days before
minutes from the  Federal Reserve  ignited concern the U.S.
central bank may curb the bond buying program that has supported
commodities and emerging-market assets. Crude oil, which with
natural gas makes up about 50 percent of Russian budget revenue,
is down 3.4 percent this week, while the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
raw materials index dropped to a one-month low yesterday.  “The stock was a victim of the Fed,” Ivan Manaenko, head
of research at Veles Capital LLC in Moscow, said by phone
yesterday. “The Fed signaled lower commodity prices and the
stock plunged, together with the rest of the market.”  Russia’s 50-stock Micex Index rose 0.2 percent to 1,496.61
in Moscow today, paring a 0.8 percent drop in the week, the
third weekly slump. Futures on  Russia ’s dollar-denominated RTS
Index fell fell 0.1 percent to 154,770 by 12:28 p.m. in  New
York . The Moscow Exchange dropped 0.3 percent today.  Price ‘Overstated’  Minutes from the Fed’s last meeting released Feb. 20 showed
that policy makers were divided over the risks and benefits of
the $85 billion in monthly asset buying designed to bolster the
 U.S. economy . Crude slipped 2.3 percent Feb. 20.  “Investors, especially foreign investors, don’t favor
Russia, because it is correlated with commodities, particularly
oil,” Anton Rakhmanov, chief executive officer at Sberbank
Asset Management, which oversees about 80 billion rubles ($2.6
billion) said by phone from Moscow yesterday. “The IPO price
was somewhat overstated. I won’t be surprised if the stock falls
further in the near term.”  The Moscow Exchange’s $498 million offering priced at the
bottom of its target range of 55 rubles to 63 rubles. The
Kremlin-backed Russian Direct Investment Fund invested $80
million in the IPO and helped attract $200 million from other
funds, Chief Executive Officer  Kirill Dmitriev  said Feb. 15.  MegaFon Jump  There have been 43 IPOs globally in February, the least
since June 2009 when there were 38 deals, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Companies have raised $6.4 billion
worldwide in initial share sales this month, the least since
August, the data show. The Micex has lost 1.9 percent in
February, after rallying in January and December.  RusPetro, a Russian oil and gas producer domiciled in the
U.K., has lost 72 percent since its IPO in London. OAO MegaFon,
the phone company whose $1.7 billion IPO in November was the
biggest initial offering by a Russian company in three years,
has climbed 31 percent in Moscow since it first started trading.
The shares have gained 39 percent in  London .  Oil fell to the lowest level this year in New York
yesterday and was 0.2 percent lower at $93.01 a barrel in New
York today. Brent oil added 0.5 percent to $114.14, paring a 3
percent weekly drop in London.  Urals crude , Russia’s chief
export blend, is down 3.9 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
