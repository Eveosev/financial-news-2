Ashland Inc. (ASH) , the biggest producer
of specialty paper-making chemicals, sold $2.3 billion of senior
unsecured notes to pay back a portion of its secured loans.  Ashland issued $600 million of 3 percent debt due in 2016
that yields 260 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, $650 million of 4.75 percent bonds maturing in 2022
with a 290 basis-point spread and $700 million of five-year
bonds with a 3.875 percent coupon that pay 304 more than
benchmarks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The deal also included $350 million of 6.875 percent
securities due 2043 that yield an extra 370 basis points,
replacing a portion of debt the Covington, Kentucky-based
company estimated would mature in 2025.  Proceeds from the sale, along with cash on hand, will be
used to repay a “significant portion” of the outstanding loans
in its senior secured credit facility, Ashland said yesterday in
a statement. The company entered into a $3.9 billion credit
facility in August 2011 with its purchase of International
Specialty Products Inc., about  $2.4 billion  of which is
outstanding in term loans due 2016 and 2018, Bloomberg data
show.  The bonds were rated Ba1 by Moody’s Investors Service and
BB by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
