The forint weakened the most in a
week and Hungarian bond yields rose on speculation the U.S.
Federal Reserve may slow the pace of bond purchases that boosted
demand for higher-yielding assets.  Hungary ’s currency depreciated after minutes of the Fed’s
Jan. 29-30 meeting sparked concern the U.S. may curtail stimulus
measures. The slump deepened after a German report showed that
manufacturing in  Europe ’s biggest economy and Hungary’s biggest
export destination expanded less in February than analysts
projected.  “The Fed minutes spoiled sentiment on markets,” Imre Kerekgyarto and Karoly Bamli, Budapest-based traders at
Commerzbank AG, wrote in an e-mail today. “The downturn in
markets began to be reflected in the forint this morning.”  The forint slid 0.6 percent to 292.9 per euro by 10:16 a.m.
in Budapest. Yields on the government’s benchmark  three-year
bonds  rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.428
percent, snapping three days of declines.  Several Fed policy makers said the central bank should be
ready to vary the pace of its $85 billion of monthly bond
purchases, according to minutes of the meeting released
yesterday.  The forint jumped 8.1 percent last year, the second-biggest
advance among more than 100 currencies tracked by Bloomberg,
after the Polish zloty, as Fed bond purchases channeled funds
toward riskier assets.  Markit Economics said its index of German manufacturing
based on a survey of  purchasing managers  was 50.1 this month
compared with 49.8 in January. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
forecast the gauge would increase to 50.5. A reading above 50
signals expansion.  The Debt Management Agency plans to sell 43 billion forint
($194 million) in bonds maturing in 2016, 2018 and 2028 at an
auction today, according to data from the agency on Bloomberg.
It’s the first sale of 15-year debt in two months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
