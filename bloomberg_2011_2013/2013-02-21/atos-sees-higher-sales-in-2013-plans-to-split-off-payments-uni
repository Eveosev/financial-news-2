Atos (ATO) , a French computer-services
company that competes with International Business Machines
Corp., will split off its electronic payments unit by mid-year
and consider selling a minority stake in the business.  The payments and transactions unit’s sales rose 5 percent
to 1.1 billion euros ($1.5 billion) last year, making up 12
percent of Bezons, France-based Atos’s total revenue, according
to a statement. Once it’s separated, Atos may sell a minority
stake in the unit or sell shares in an initial public offering,
Senior Executive Vice President Gilles Grapinet said today on a
conference call with reporters.  “The point of the carve-out is to gain financial and
strategic flexibility,” Grapinet said. Atos, which had net cash
of 232 million euros at the end of the year, is conducting an
“intense search for potential acquisition opportunities,”
Grapinet said.  Sales at Atos will increase “slightly” this year and
adjusted non-diluted earnings per share will probably rise 25
percent, Atos forecast today.  Net income rose 23 percent to 224 million euros in 2012 and
revenue reached 8.8 billion euros. Revenue advanced 0.8 percent
excluding acquisitions. Analysts had predicted full-year profit
of 259.6 million euros and sales of 8.85 billion euros,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  IT Market  The technology services market grew 3.3 percent in 2012 to
$650 billion and is expected to grow 3.9 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg Industries analyst Anurag Rana. There are
concerns about weakness in the European market given the
economic outlook, Rana said.  Atos, headed by Thierry Breton, a former finance minister
who has been chief executive officer since November 2008, makes
about half of its revenue from  Germany , the U.K. and  France . Its
competitors at home include  Cap Gemini SA. (CAP)   Shares of Atos fell 1.5 percent to 56.38 euros. They have
gained 30 percent during the past 12 months and are trading near
their highest level in  seven years .  To contact the reporter on this story:
