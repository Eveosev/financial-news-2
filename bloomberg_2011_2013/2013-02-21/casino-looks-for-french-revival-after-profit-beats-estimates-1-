Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO) , the
owner of France’s Monoprix and Geant supermarket chains, said it
aims to revive sales in its home market after 2012 earnings beat
analysts’ estimates, driven by the international business.  Trading profit from continuing operations increased 29
percent to 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion), the Saint-Etienne,
France-based company said today in a statement. Earnings
exceeded the 1.94 billion-euro average of 11  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. Casino said on Jan. 15 that sales rose 22 percent
to 42 billion euros.  Competition between grocers is intensifying in  Europe  as
consumers tighten their belts amid an economic contraction.
Casino, which forecast that 2012 profit would be more than 1.94
billion euros, can probably cut prices in  France  this year after
weak household consumption led to declining sales in the country
in the fourth quarter, the grocer said last month.  The main driver of profit was Casino’s international
division, whose earnings gained 65 percent to 1.32 billion
euros, while in France, trading profit fell 8.6 percent to 685
million euros.  Internationally, “growth should continue in 2013,
sustained by the emergence of numerous middle classes whose
purchasing power is growing,” Casino said today.  In France, the company is counting on “stabilizing or
reviving retail” and will focus on price cuts in hypermarkets,
cost reductions and expansion of its main formats, the retailer
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
