Barcelona defender  Eric Abidal  has
been cleared to play, 10 months after undergoing a liver
transplant, the Spanish soccer club said on its website.  Abidal, 33, had the transplant last April after previously
having a tumor removed from his liver in March 2011. He began a
training program in October and re-joined his teammates for
practice sessions in December.  Abidal’s last game was a 2-1 win over Atletico Madrid on
Feb. 26, 2012. The club didn’t say when he would play his first
match.  Barcelona leads La Liga by 12 points over Atletico Madrid
ahead of this weekend’s game against Sevilla. The club is also
in the semifinals of the Copa del Rey and the final 16 of the
 Champions League , where it lost the first leg 2-0 at AC Milan
last night.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
