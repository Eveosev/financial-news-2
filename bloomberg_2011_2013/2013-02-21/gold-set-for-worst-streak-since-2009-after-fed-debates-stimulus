Platinum slumped to a six-week low
on signs that  Europe  is struggling to recover from a recession,
boosting concern that demand will slow. Gold was little changed.  Euro-area services and manufacturing contracted at a faster
pace than economists forecast in February, data from London-
based  Markit Economics  showed today. Minutes released yesterday
from a Federal Reserve policy meeting showed some officials said
the central bank should vary its asset purchases. Platinum
surged 64 percent in the four years through Dec. 31 as the Fed
increased stimulus measures.  “Slowdown in Europe and yesterday’s negative news from the
Fed are pushing platinum lower,” Phil Streible, a senior
commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien & Associates, said in a
telephone interview.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery fell 1.6 percent to settle at $1,620 an ounce at
1:24 p.m. Earlier, prices slumped to $1,599, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Jan. 10.  Europe is the biggest market for platinum used in
pollution-control devices for vehicles, according to London-
based Johnson Matthey.  Gold futures for April delivery rose less than 0.1 percent
to $1,578.60 an ounce on the Comex in New York, after reaching
$1,554.30, the lowest since June 29. Prices slumped 4.3 percent
in the previous five sessions.  There is a potential for pent-up demand from  India  to
“kick in” given the magnitude of the recent price declines,
UBS AG said in a report today. Bullion is down 5.1 percent in
February, heading for the biggest monthly drop since May.  Palladium futures for delivery in March retreated 0.4
percent to $733.60 an ounce on the Nymex after dropping to
$708.30, the lowest since Jan. 16.  Silver futures for March delivery climbed 0.3 percent to
$28.699 an ounce on the Comex.  Trading volumes for silver, platinum and palladium were
more than twice the 100-day average for this time of day, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
