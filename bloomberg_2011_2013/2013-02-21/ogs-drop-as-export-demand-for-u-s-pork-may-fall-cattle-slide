Hog futures fell, heading for the
longest decline since October 2011, on signs of weakening
overseas demand for U.S. pork. Cattle dropped.  China , the third-biggest buyer of American pork, has asked
the U.S. for further documentation that shipments are free of
ractopamine, a feed additive used to add lean muscle in
livestock, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation.  Russia ,
the sixth-biggest buyer of U.S. pork and beef in 2012, has
banned imports of American meat because the products may contain
ractopamine.  “The demand challenge is there in the export market right
now,” Lawrence Kane, a market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group
in Yates City,  Illinois , said in a telephone interview. “We
ship an awful lot of pork. Internationally right now, we have a
question on demand.”  Hog futures for April settlement declined 0.8 percent to
82.275 cents a pound at 10:06 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after touching 81.7 cents, the lowest since Nov. 12.
Prices are headed for the seventh straight drop, the longest
slump since Oct. 27, 2011.  Cattle futures for April delivery slid 0.1 percent to
$1.2805 a pound. The commodity was down 3.1 percent this year
through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement were unchanged
at $1.40725 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
