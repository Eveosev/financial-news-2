Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the largest
U.S. gold producer, reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates after taxes were lower than expected.  Net income was $673 million, or $1.36 a share, compared
with a loss of $1.03 billion, or $2.02, a year earlier,
 Greenwood Village , Colorado-based Newmont said yesterday in a
statement. Earnings excluding an income-tax benefit and other
one-time items were $1.11 a share, beating the 97-cent average
of 18  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 11 percent to
$2.48 billion.  “Upside to our model was primarily driven by a lower-than-
expected tax rate of 15 percent versus our 32 percent
estimate,” Brian Yu, a San Francisco-based analyst at Citigroup
Inc., said in a note today. “This was somewhat offset by higher
attributable gold cash costs.”  Newmont, which announced Dec. 3 that Chief Operating
Officer Gary Goldberg will replace Chief Executive Officer
Richard O’Brien March 1, is among gold producers seeking to curb
rising costs. Average costs applicable to sales in the fourth
quarter were $720 an ounce of gold and $2.61 a pound of copper,
compared with $602 an ounce and $1.58 a year ago. The company
said last month it expected costs of $700 to $715 an ounce of
gold and $2.60 and $2.70 per pound of copper.  CFO Departure  Newmont also said yesterday that Chief Financial Officer
Russell Ball will leave the company later this year. Ball will
continue in his current role as the company seeks a replacement.  Newmont swung to a net loss in the fourth quarter of 2011
after taking a $1.61 billion asset-impairment charge on the Hope
Bay project in  Canada .  Gold, which has risen for 12 straight years, averaged
$1,719.36 on the Comex in  New York  in the fourth quarter, 1.9
percent more than a year earlier and 3.8 percent higher than in
the previous three months. Prices have fallen this year and
reached a seven-month low yesterday as signs of economic
improvement curbed demand for a protection of wealth.  Newmont, which has mines in the Americas, the Asia-Pacific
region and  Africa , said last month it produced 5 million ounces
of gold and 143 million pounds of copper in 2012. Output this
year is forecast at 4.8 million to 5.1 million ounces of gold
and 150 million to 170 million pounds of copper.  Newmont rose 0.7 percent to $40.82 at the close in New
York.  The shares  have declined 12 percent this year.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , based in Toronto, is the biggest gold
producer by sales and market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
