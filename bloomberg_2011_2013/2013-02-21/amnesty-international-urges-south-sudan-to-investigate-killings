South  Sudan  should arrest members of
the security forces who killed 11 protesters in December in
Western Bahr El Ghazal state, Amnesty International said.  The killings and subsequent “arbitrary arrests” of
“scores” of people accused of instigating the protests have
heightened tensions in the area, the London-based human rights
group said. While video footage shows officers firing on unarmed
protesters, no members of the security forces have been
arrested, it said.  “Those responsible for unlawful killings, including the
security forces responsible for killing protesters, must
promptly be held to account,”  Amnesty ’s Africa director,
Netsanet Belay, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Government spokesman Barnaba Marial Benjamin didn’t answer
calls seeking comment.  The protests began after the state government decided to
relocate the administrative headquarters of Wau County from the
city of Wau, the state capital, to Bagari, a town 19 kilometres
(12 miles) away. During the violence, more than 5,000 people
took shelter in a United Nations peacekeepers’ camp.  Hilde Johnson, who heads the UN Mission, told reporters in
Juba on Feb. 15 that the national parliament’s investigations
committee should “complete its work with urgency.”  The UN is “very concerned about the increasing number of
prolonged arrests,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
