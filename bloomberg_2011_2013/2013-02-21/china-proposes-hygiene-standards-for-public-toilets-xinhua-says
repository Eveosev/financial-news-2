China  proposed hygiene standards for
public restrooms, including requiring twice the number of stalls
in women’s washrooms than men’s washrooms in service areas used
equally by both genders, the official Xinhua News Agency said.  The draft rules from the Ministry of Health also advise
installing screens between urinals and doors to toilet stalls in
men’s washrooms, and propose standards for design, layout,
odors, cleaning, equipment and disinfection, Xinhua reported.  Under the rules, toilets attached to buildings should have
no more than one fly per square meter and freestanding restrooms
no more than three flies a square meter, Xinhua reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
