Commodities slumped to the lowest
level in more than three weeks as Federal Reserve minutes showed
policy makers advocated more flexibility in U.S. policy to
stimulate the economy.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials fell
0.6 percent to 664.04 at 2:27 p.m. Singapore time, the lowest
level since Jan. 28. The gauge declined for a fourth day, the
worst run since December.  Several policy makers said the central bank should be ready
to vary the pace of their $85 billion in monthly bond purchases
amid a debate over the risks and benefits of further easing,
minutes of the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s Jan. 29-30
meeting showed. Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  urged local
authorities to “decisively” curb real estate speculation. The
country is the world’s biggest user of energy and metals.  “The Fed minutes and concerns over  China ’s property sector
hurt  market sentiment , weighing on China’s stock market and
commodities,” said Peng Guoliang, an analyst at Dadi Futures
Co. Asian stocks tumbled from an 18-month high, falling 1.6
percent for the first decline in four days.  Crude oil fell 0.8 percent to $94.42 a barrel, copper
declined 0.6 percent to $7,910 a metric ton and soybeans lost
0.7 percent to $14.58 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
