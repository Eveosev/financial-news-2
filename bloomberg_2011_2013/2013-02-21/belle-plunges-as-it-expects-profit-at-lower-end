Belle International Holdings Ltd., (1880) 
China’s biggest footwear retailer, fell by a record in Hong Kong
trading after saying 2012 profit is likely to be at the lower
end of analyst estimates. Rival  Daphne International Holdings
Ltd. (210)  also fell.  Belle plunged 17 percent to HK$15.28, the biggest decline
since it listed in May 2007. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  fell
1.7 percent.  The company anticipates that its 2012 net profit will be
“marginally higher” than the previous year’s and “will fall
within the lower end” of analysts’ estimates from 4.29 billion
yuan ($687 million) to 4.85 billion yuan, it said in a  filing  to
Hong Kong stock exchange last night. Belle had a net profit of
4.25 billion  yuan  in 2011.  “Investors had high hopes on the industry recovery, but
Belle’s announcement last night indicates that it will take
longer for the industry to recover,” Sarah Xing, a Hong Kong-
based analyst at Nomura International HK, said by phone.
“Hence, investors are now readjusting their positions.”  Sales were “rather weak for apparel and footwear” over
the Lunar New Year and won’t recover until second half of this
year, she said.  Smaller rival Daphne dropped 6.4 percent to HK$9.68.  To contact the reporter on this story:
