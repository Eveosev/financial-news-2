Rodney Tsang, who became co-head of
corporate and investment banking for the greater  China  region
for  Citigroup Inc. (C)  less than a year ago, has left, the bank’s
spokesman Richard Tesvich confirmed.  Tsang departed from the firm today, Hong Kong-based Tesvich
said by telephone. Tsang’s co-head, Roger Zhu, will lead the
unit on his own, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
Tsang didn’t return five calls to his mobile phone this week
seeking comment.  Citigroup hired Tsang in September 2009 from Bank of
America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit as co-head of China
investment banking as Farhan Faruqui, the Asia-Pacific head of
global banking, sought to rebuild the New York-based company’s
China team to fill holes left by senior departures.  Zhu, who had joined Citigroup in October 2011, had
previously spent almost a decade at China International Capital
Corp., the first Sino-foreign investment bank in China.  Last year, Citigroup was ranked No. 8 in arranging overseas
share sales by Chinese companies, down from No. 6 in 2011, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The bank aims to be among the top
three in China for corporate or investment banking, a target
that can be reached within two years, Faruqui had said in an
interview in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
