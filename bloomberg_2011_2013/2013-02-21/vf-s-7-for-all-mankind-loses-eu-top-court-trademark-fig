Jeans maker 7 For All Mankind lost a
final bid to get the European Union trademark rights to its name
after the EU’s top court ruled in favor of an Italian  backpack
manufacturer .  The EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg today dismissed an
appeal by the company to get trademark rights across the 27-
nation bloc for “Seven For All Mankind.” The ruling can’t be
appealed.  The  VF Corp. (VFC)  unit previously won the rights to the name in
2010 when the bloc’s trademark authority in Alicante,  Spain ,
rejected a challenge by Italian company Seven SpA. The agency
said there was no likelihood of confusion with the Italian
company’s trademarks for the word Seven. A lower EU court later
 overturned  that decision.  The EU General Court in 2011 ruled that “there is a
certain overall similarity between the marks at issue” because
the presence of the word Seven in the names “is not
insignificant.”  That court, the region’s second-highest, “did not commit
the error of law alleged by the applicant,” the Court of
Justice ruled today, dismissing all points of appeal that were
raised.  7 For All Mankind first applied in 2005 for the EU
trademark to cover products such as jewelry, belts, suitcases
and backpacks. Representatives for VF in Greensboro,  North
Carolina , didn’t immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment,
or answer calls before regular office hours.  The case is: C-655/11 P, Seven for all mankind v. Seven.  To contact the reporter on this story:
