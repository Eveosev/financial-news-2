A new Slovenian government formation
to replace the minority administration would probably lead the
nation into bankruptcy this year, Prime Minister Janez Jansa
said.  The parties that are trying to form a new Cabinet and
topple the current one “don’t know exactly what they are going
to do and I am afraid that if we see such an outcome, the agony
will continue and we will be close to bankruptcy this year,”
Jansa was quoted as saying in an interview with public
broadcaster  TV Slovenija  late yesterday.  The other option is to agree on the most important tasks to
be carried through with the current government and then decide
on the timing of an early vote, Jansa said.  Slovenia, a member of the euro region, was plunged into
political uncertainty last month over corruption allegations
against Jansa that prompted two of his coalition partners to
abandon the Cabinet, increasing the risk of an early vote and a
possible bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
