Brazil’s  Ultrapar Participacoes SA (UGPA3) ,
the fuel distributor that has expanded food sales at its service
stations, soared to a record after reporting fourth-quarter
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  Shares jumped 4.5 percent to 52.69 reais at the close of
trading in  Sao Paulo , the biggest rally since Sept. 3. Trading
volume was 2.9 times the three-month average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Adjusted net income  was 298.8 million reais ($151.5
million) in the fourth quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg after the company reported earnings yesterday. That
compares with analysts’ average estimate of 261.3 million reais.  “The company continues to report solid results, which will
sustain the stock’s performance,” Itau BBA analysts Paula Kovarsky and Diego Mendes wrote in a research note.  Ultrapar has advanced 40 percent in the past year while the
benchmark  Bovespa index  has fallen 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
