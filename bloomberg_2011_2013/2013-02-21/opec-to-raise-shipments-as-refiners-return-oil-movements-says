The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will bolster crude shipments through to the
middle of next month to meet rising demand in  Asia , according to
tanker tracker Oil Movements.  The group that supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil
will export 23.56 million barrels a day in the four weeks to
March 16, up 120,000 barrels or 0.5 percent from the previous
period, the researcher said today in an e-mailed report. The
figures exclude Angola and  Ecuador .  “The only possible explanation is relatively strong
eastern demand,”  Roy Mason , the company’s founder, said by
phone from Halifax,  England . “There’s also a slight uptick in
western movements, reflecting the fact we’re past the trough”
in seasonal consumption, he said.  Middle East shipments will increase by 0.3 percent to 17.22
million barrels a day in the period, compared with 17.16 million
in the four weeks to Feb. 16, according to Oil Movements. That
figure includes non-OPEC members Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will average 464.19 million barrels,
up 1.3 percent on the previous period, the data show. Oil
Movements calculates the volumes by tallying tanker bookings.
Its figures exclude crude held on vessels for storage.  OPEC comprises Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. The organization is next scheduled to
meet in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
