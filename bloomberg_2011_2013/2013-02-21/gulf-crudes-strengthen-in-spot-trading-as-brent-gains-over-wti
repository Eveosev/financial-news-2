Gulf of Mexico  crude grades
strengthened on the spot market as Brent oil gained ground
against U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate.  Brent, the benchmark for overseas exports, gained 29 cents
to a  premium  of $20.67 a barrel against WTI at a 2:08 p.m.  New
York  time. Offshore domestic crudes tend to strengthen along
with international  oil prices  because they compete in the same
coastal refinery market.  Light Louisiana Sweet oil strengthened 50 cents to $22.75 a
barrel above WTI in Cushing at 2:02 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 90
cents to $23 a barrel.  Mars Blend advanced 25 cents to $17.75 above Brent, while
Bonito Sour strengthened 40 cents to a $20.15 premium.  Poseidon’s premium declined 15 cents to $18 a barrel over
WTI, while Southern Green lost 25 cents to a $15.75-a-barrel
premium.  Spot market  activity was light as traders covered positions
and balanced their books before tomorrow’s scheduling deadline
for March pipeline delivery. The last days of spot trading
before the cutoff are typically characterized by light volume
and erratic pricing.  In New York, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures for
April delivery declined to a six-week low as government data
showed that U.S. crude supplies rose to the highest level since
July. WTI fell 2.3% to $92.89 a barrel at 2:12 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
