OMV AG (OMV) , central Europe’s biggest oil
company, boosted its dividend after fourth-quarter profit gained
on increased production in  Libya .  Net rose 19 percent, to 393 million euros ($521 million),
on sales of 11.4 billion euros, the Vienna-based company said
today on its  website . That was in line with the average
estimates of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “We benefited from the return of production in Libya and
from a stabilized, on-target production in Romania and
Austria,” OMV Chief Executive Officer Gerhard Roiss said in the
statement. The company proposed a 1.20 euro dividend, 5 cents
more than expected, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  OMV’s Libyan production plummeted after the revolt against
former leader  Muammar Qaddafi  erupted in February 2011. Output
has since recovered. The company is diversifying its exploration
and production program beyond its core markets to seek more oil
in the  North Sea  and  Black Sea .  “Today two-thirds of our production is in core markets of
Austria and Romania,” exploration and production head Jaap
Huijskes said today at a press conference. “In 2021 the
portfolio will have expanded considerably with one-third of
production in core countries.”  OMV, which produced 303,000 barrels of oil per day in 2012,
expects production to remain steady in 2013 before rising
thereafter, Huijskes said. The company is targeting 350,000
barrels by 2016.  Negotiations over long-term natural gas supply contracts
with Russia’s  Gazprom OAO (GAZP)  will take place this year and will
result in lower prices by 2014, gas and power head Hans-Peter
Floren said at the briefing. The spread between long-term
contracts linked to  oil prices  and spot natural gas prices hurt
earnings, he said.  “The result of 2013 will of course be linked to this
difference and will be burdened by this spread even further,”
Floren said.  OMV fell as much as 75 cents, or 2.4 percent, to 30.21
euros a share and was trading at 30.36 euros at 2:14 p.m. local
time in Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
