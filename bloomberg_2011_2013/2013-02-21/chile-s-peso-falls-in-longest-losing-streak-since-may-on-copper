Chile ’s peso weakened versus the
dollar for a sixth day, its longest stretch of losses in nine
months, as a decline in the price of copper eroded the outlook
for export revenue.  The currency fell less than 0.1 percent to 473.31 per
dollar at the close in Santiago. The peso has retreated 0.6
percent from its high this month of 470.65 reached Feb. 13.  “The peso has been following the evolution of global
markets during the last week,” Eugenio Cortes, the head of
currency forwards trading at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA,
said in a phone interview. “Copper has been falling, so has the
euro, and stock markets a little less, so it’s impossible for
the peso to be unaffected by that.”  Copper, Chile’s main export, retreated 1.5 percent on
concern the U.S. Federal Reserve will slow the pace of economic
stimulus and as China sought to rein in real estate growth.  Some Fed policy makers said the central bank should be
ready to vary the pace of bond purchases, known as quantitative
easing, minutes of the January meeting showed yesterday. Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao called on local authorities to “decisively”
curb property speculation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
