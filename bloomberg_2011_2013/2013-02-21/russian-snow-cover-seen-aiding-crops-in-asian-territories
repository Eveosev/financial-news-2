Crops in grain-growing areas of
Russia’s Asian territories, which accounted for about 18 percent
of the national grain harvest this season, “wintered safely”
in the 10 days through Feb. 20 with the help of snow cover, the
state weather forecaster  said .  A snow layer 35 centimeters to 45 centimeters (13.8 inches
to 17.7 inches) thick helped seeds survive temperatures as low
as minus 11 degrees Celsius (12.2 degrees Fahrenheit) in grain-
growing areas of the Ural and Siberian federal districts in the
period, the weather center said on its website. The two
districts harvested 12.4 million metric tons of grains this
season, out of a total crop of 70.7 million tons, according to
the state statistics data.  In Russia’s south, an ice crust of 7 millimeters to 11
millimeters hampered development of winter grains at some places
in the northern part of Rostov and in Volgograd in the period,
it said. The areas are among  Russia ’s top 10 grain-producing
areas and together harvested about 8.6 million tons of grains
this marketing year, according to state statistics data.  The weather will be “predominantly satisfactory” for
winter crops in Russia’s European territory and will be normal
for the time of year in the Asian part of the country from today
until the end of this month, the center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
