India’s rupee snapped a two-day gain
on concern U.S. policy makers may slow debt purchases that
boosted the supply of dollars and contributed to inflows into
 emerging markets .  Minutes from the  Federal Reserve ’s last meeting released
yesterday show several officials said the monetary authority
should vary the pace of buying bonds. The Dollar Index, which
tracks the greenback against six major trading partners, rose to
a three-month high. The rupee’s losses will be limited as
foreign investors will still buy the nation’s debt, according to
Development Credit Bank Ltd.  “There is caution after the Fed minutes as inflows may
slow,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a trader at Development Credit
Bank in Mumbai. “The inflows into rupee debt will keep the
currency supported for a few days.”  The rupee declined 0.7 percent to 54.4225 per dollar as of
9:44 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency’s drop may be capped at 54.50, Raghuvanshi said.
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
exchange rate used to price options, rose 10 basis points, or
0.1 percentage point, to 9.20 percent.  The Securities & Exchange Board of  India  sold 666.7 billion
rupees ($12.2 billion) of debt-purchase quotas to foreign
investors at a monthly auction yesterday. India raised the cap
on overseas purchases of the notes by $10 billion to $75 billion
last month.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.51 per
dollar, compared with 55.12 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.35 versus 55.02. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
