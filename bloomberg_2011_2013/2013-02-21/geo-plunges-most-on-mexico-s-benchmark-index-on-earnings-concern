Corp. Geo SAB (GEOB) ,  Mexico ’s third-
biggest publicly-traded homebuilder by market value, plunged the
most in nine months on speculation that fourth-quarter results
will be weaker than anticipated.  The stock tumbled 7.3 percent to 11.25 pesos at 1:11 p.m.
in Mexico City trading, the biggest drop on a closing basis
since May 3. The stock led declines on the  benchmark IPC index ,
which fell 0.9 percent, and the  Habita index  of Mexican
homebuilders, which declined 4.1 percent.  “The market is really, really trying to stay far away from
the housing sector, at least until we can see some numbers,”
Javier Gayol, an analyst with Mexico City-based brokerage
Corporativo GBM SAB, said in a telephone interview. “Until then
we can expect the companies to continue to fall.”  Mexico City-based Geo and other homebuilders are scheduled
to report fourth-quarter earnings next week. A decline in
mortgages for new homes from the state-controlled lender
Infonavit suggests the results will be weak, Gayol said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
