Aleksei German, a famed Soviet film
director whose movies including “Road Checks” were suppressed
in  Russia  for years, has died. He was 74.  His son, Aleksei German, Jr., said his father died today in
St. Petersburg’s Military Medical Academy. A burial service will
be held in the coming days, he said.  “My father has lived his life in dignity,” his son, also
a prominent film director, said in a blog posting on the Ekho
Moskvy radio station’s  website . “He never betrayed his ideals;
never sold out; never bartered himself in exchange for vanity. I
believe he left for a better world.”  His final movie, based on a science-fiction novel by the
Strugatsky brothers, “Hard to Be a God,” will be finished
after audio post-production is completed, German’s son said. A
recipient of Russian and international film awards, German
directed “My Friend Ivan Lapshin,” an account of everyday life
during dictator Josef Stalin’s purges, and a World War II drama,
“Road Checks,” also known as “Trial on the Road.” Both films
were shelved by Soviet censors and not released until the 1980s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
