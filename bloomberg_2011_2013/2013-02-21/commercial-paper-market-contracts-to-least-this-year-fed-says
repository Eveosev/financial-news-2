The market for corporate borrowing
through  short-term IOUs  contracted to the lowest level of 2013.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
fell $22.4 billion to $1.063 trillion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the fifth straight drop, the Federal Reserve
said today on its website. Thatâ€™s the longest stretch of
declines since the period ended Oct. 24 and the least since the
market touched $1.058 trillion Dec. 19.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
