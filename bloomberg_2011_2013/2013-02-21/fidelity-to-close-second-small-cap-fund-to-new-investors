Fidelity Investments , the second-
biggest mutual  fund manager  in the U.S., plans for the second
time this year to bar new investors from a fast-growing fund
focused on small-company stocks.  The $3.5 billion  Fidelity Small Cap Value Fund (FCPVX)  will take
deposits only from existing shareholders beginning March 1, the
Boston-based company said today in a statement. The fund, which
has outperformed 95 percent of peers in the past year after
returning 19 percent, saw assets rise 41 percent in the year
ended Jan. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Small Cap Value Fund has experienced a steadily growing
asset base and more recently strengthening investor cash
flows,” Brian B. Hogan, president of Fidelity’s equity group,
said in the statement. “We’ve analyzed the situation closely,
and believe that it’s in the interests of shareholders to close
the fund to new investors at this time.”  Fidelity said Jan. 16 it would close its Small Cap
Discovery Fund to new investors by the end of that month after
assets almost doubled in the prior year. The fund, which
returned 7.8 percent in January, saw assets surge 27 percent
during the month to $4.9 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Small-cap U.S. mutual funds gathered $2.5 billion in
assets in the period, according to Chicago-based research firm
 Morningstar Inc. (MORN)   Asset managers sometimes close funds to new investors after
large deposits, which can make it difficult to invest money as
effectively as existing assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
