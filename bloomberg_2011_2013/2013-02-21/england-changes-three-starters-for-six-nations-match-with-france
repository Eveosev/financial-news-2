Courtney Lawes was among three
changes to the  England  rugby team starting lineup for this
weekend’s Six Nations game against France.  Manu Tuilagi and  Dylan Hartley  are the other changes from
the lineup that began the 12-6 win over Ireland in Dublin two
weeks ago, which left England as the tournament’s only unbeaten
team.  Lawes will replace  James Haskell  at blindside flanker,
Tuilagi takes over for Billy Twelvetrees in the midfield and
Hartley starts at hooker in place of Tom Young. Haskell,
Twelvetrees and Young are all among the substitutes for the
match in two days at Twickenham Stadium in London.  “We thought long and hard about changing a winning team
which did so well against Ireland,” England coach  Stuart Lancaster  said in a statement. “But we believe that Dylan,
Courtney and Manu are ready for the opportunity and allow us to
vary our play, while the bench will add impact and energy as the
game unfolds in the second half.”  England leads the Six Nations standings with four points
after two games. Scotland,  Wales , Ireland and Italy all have two
points, with France, the bookmakers’ pre-tournament favorite for
the title, winless.  To contact the reporter on this story:
