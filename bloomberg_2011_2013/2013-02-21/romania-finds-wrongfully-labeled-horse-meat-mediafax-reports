Romania â€™s Food Safety Authority
found horse meat labeled as beef in a warehouse near the capital
Bucharest following an investigation,  Mediafax  reported late
yesterday, citing a document from the agency.  The veterinary watchdog said the meat originated from a
cold storage in Alba county, in the center of Romania, according
to the Bucharest-based newspaper.  The food safety authority confiscated all the meat and
closed the warehouses, Mihai Turcanu, the head of the authority,
said in an interview on television station Antena3 today.  The Romanian authorities started an investigation of
slaughterhouses and meat suppliers in the country after a
European-wide scandal on the wrongful labeling of horse meat. On
Feb. 11, Romania denied any allegations that its slaughterhouses
misrepresented horse meat as beef.  To contact the reporter on this story:
