The euro touched the lowest level
against the dollar in six weeks after the  European Central Bank 
said institutions will repay less of Long-Term Refinancing
Operation borrowing next week than economists forecast.  The 17-nation currency trimmed gains versus the yen as the
European Commission forecast the region’s economy will shrink
for a second year in 2013. The Australian dollar rose the most
in seven weeks after central bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  said
the bar for intervention was high.  Japan ’s currency weakened
amid a White House meeting between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and
President  Barack Obama , who made no mention of the yen during
remarks after the discussion.  “The market is trading on confidence and sentiment, and
the LTRO news shows that tail risk has shrunk less than we
thought,”  Greg Anderson , New York-based head of Group of 10
currency strategy at Citigroup Inc., said in a telephone
interview. “What we’ve seen this week is the last of the euro
longs getting squeezed out.” A long position is a bet that an
asset will rise.  The euro fell was little changed at $1.3194 at 5 p.m. in
New York after touching $1.3145, the lowest level since Jan. 10.
The shared currency declined 1.2 percent this week. It rose 0.3
percent 123.22 yen today after strengthening as much as 0.8
percent. The yen weakened 0.3 percent to 93.42 per dollar.  The euro may depreciate to the 2013 low of $1.2998 it
reached on Jan. 4 if it declines past a support level at
$1.3151, Cilline Bain, a London-based technical analyst at
Credit Suisse, wrote today in a client note. Support is an area
on a chart where buy orders may be clustered.  Aussie Gains  The Australian dollar rose at least 0.2 percent against all
of its 16 major counterparts after Stevens said he’d need to be
confident the currency was “seriously overvalued” before
considering intervention to weaken it.  “Stevens’s comments are very firmly focused on what a
strong currency means for inflation, rather than including any
threat of action,” said  Sean Callow , a senior currency
strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in Sydney. “The tone of his
prepared comments indicates no great urgency to cut rates.”  The Aussie jumped as much as 0.9 percent, the biggest gain
since Jan. 2, before trading up 0.7 percent at $1.0320.  India ’s rupee gained against most of its major peers on
optimism slowing inflation and prospects of an economic revival
will attract capital flows. The currency rebounded from a one-
month low as Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. said investors should
consider purchasing the rupee as India’s economic fundamentals
are improving.  The rupee appreciated 0.5 percent to 54.1850 per dollar
after rising 0.6 percent, its biggest gain since Jan. 30.  Loonie Dives  The Canadian dollar weakened versus all but two of its 16
most-traded counterparts as  retail sales  slid 2.1 percent to
C$38.6 billion ($37.9 billion), bringing the value of retailer
receipts to the lowest since September 2011. The nation’s
inflation rate reached its lowest in more than three years.  “It’s a hugely disappointing number at a sensitive time of
year for retailers,” Adam Button, a Montreal-based currency
analyst at Forexlive.com, said by phone from New York of the
retail data. “The market was soft in the Canadian dollar coming
into this, and this number is certainly going to keep the
momentum going.”  The so-called loonie fell 0.3 percent to C$1.0215 per  U.S.
dollar  after earlier weakening to C$1.0256, its lowest level
since June 29. The currency dropped for a sixth day in its
longest losing streak since August 2011.  German Confidence  The common currency declined as the ECB said 356 banks will
hand back 61.1 billion euros ($80.5 billion) on Feb. 27, the
first opportunity for early repayment of the second LTRO. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey was for 122.5 billion
euros.  The region’s gross domestic product will contract 0.3
percent in 2013, compared with a November prediction of 0.1
percent growth, the Brussels-based commission said.  The euro rose earlier after the  Germany ’s Ifo institute in
Munich said its  business climate  index, based on a survey of
7,000 executives, climbed to 107.4 from 104.3 in January. That’s
the fourth straight gain. Economists predicted an increase to
104.9, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “Given the more positive sentiment over the past couple of
months in financial markets, the stronger German Ifo today is
perhaps not that surprising,” said Kiran Kowshik, a foreign-
exchange strategist at BNP Paribas SA in  London . “We
established a buy-euro recommendation yesterday.”  The meeting between Abe and Obama in  Washington  followed a
Group of 20 summit in Moscow that ended Feb. 16 with finance
ministers and central bankers signaling support for Japanese
stimulus as long as Abe’s ministers cease public advocation of a
weaker currency.  The yen tumbled 12 percent in the past three months, the
worst performer of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 0.6
percent, and the euro rose 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
