HudBay Minerals Inc. (HBM)  fell the most
in nine months after saying the cost estimate of a Canadian
zinc, copper and gold mine rose, rainfall disrupted work at its
Peruvian project and it may be unable to maintain its dividend.  HudBay  fell  6.3 percent to C$9.44 at 10:29 a.m. in Toronto,
where the company is based. The shares earlier declined 8.4
percent, the most intraday since May 14.  HudBay, which expects to more than quadruple copper output
by 2015, increased the cost estimate for its Lalor project in
Manitoba by 13 percent to C$794 million ($779 million), and said
it is “uncertain” its 10-cent semi-annual dividend can be
maintained until the company’s new mines achieve commercial
production.  “With higher operating and capital costs built in for
Lalor, our model suggests the balance sheet could be squeezed in
2014-2015,” Patrick Morton, an analyst at Royal Bank of Canada,
said in a note today. “We assume total additional debt of C$450
million, but the company has options to raise funds, including a
minority stake sale, or equipment financing for Constancia.”  The Constancia project in  Peru  experienced a higher-than-
normal amount of rainfall, which slowed progress to date, HudBay
said yesterday in its fourth-quarter earnings statement released
after the close of regular trading. The company said it believes
the impact on the project schedule is “recoverable” and hasn’t
changed its targets for production start up in late 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
