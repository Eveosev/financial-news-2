U.S. farm exports will rise to a
record this fiscal year as overseas buyers pay more for tight
supplies of crops damaged by the worst drought since the 1930s,
the government said.  The value of shipments will increase to $142 billion in the
year ending Oct. 1,  Joe Glauber , the chief  economist at the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture , said today in a speech at the
agency’s annual outlook forum in Arlington, Virginia. The
forecast is down from $145 billion projected in November.
Exports for the previous year totaled $135.8 billion, the USDA
said.  China will be the biggest customer for U.S. farm products
for a second straight year, with a projected $22 billion in
purchases, mostly soybeans and cotton, the USDA said.  The bulk of the sales will be made before this year’s
harvests, which will be larger than last year’s and ease strain
on crop inventories, Glauber said. Farmer net  income  will be a
record $128.2 billion in 2013 as growers rebuild drought-
depleted inventories, the USDA said last week.  The department will update its agricultural trade estimates
in May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
