Manufacturing in the Philadelphia
region unexpectedly contracted in February for a second month.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
 index  dropped to minus 12.5, the lowest reading since June, from
minus 5.8 in January. Readings lower than zero signal
contraction in the area covering eastern  Pennsylvania , southern
New Jersey and  Delaware . The median forecast of 58 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg projected an increase to 1.  The reading follows New York Fed data released last week
that showed factory activity rebounded after six months of
contraction, raising prospects that factories could contribute
to expansion this year. At the same time, unresolved fiscal
policy negotiations and the January increase in payroll taxes
may convince companies to hold the line on stockpiles, trimming
orders to manufacturers.  “There are some conflicting signals here and there, but
overall the sector should improve,” Yelena Shulyatyeva, a U.S.
economist at BNP Paribas in New York, said before the report.
“World growth should pick up marginally this year, and that
should be supportive of manufacturing in the U.S.”  Bloomberg survey  estimates  ranged from minus 4 to 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
