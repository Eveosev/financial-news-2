Ireland’s National Asset Management
Agency, set up in 2009 to purge the country’s banks of their
riskiest assets, plans to make “significant investments” in
 office space  in the Dublin docklands area.    NAMA Chairman Frank Daly said in a statement today the
developments, part of a 2 billion-euro investment program, will
be to meet demand in the financial services and technology
industries.  The agency has completed the sale of 7 billion euros of
assets, and is “close to completing” a further 2 billion
euros, he said. Eighty percent of the sales have been in
Britain, according to Daly.  NAMA is currently overseeing sales of 1.5 billion euros of
Irish property and managing the disposal of more than 1.1
billion euros of Irish loans, according to the statement.   The agency is providing a 1 billion-euro  credit line  to the
liquidators of the former Anglo Irish Bank Corp., Daly said. The
size of NAMA’s balance sheet may increase by as much as 50
percent depending on the size of the loan transfers from the
failed bank to the agency, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
