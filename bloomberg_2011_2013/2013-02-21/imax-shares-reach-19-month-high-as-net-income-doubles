Imax Corp. (IMAX)  shares reached their
highest level in 11 months after the company said that growing
international demand for movies shown in its large-screen format
helped double fourth-quarter profit.  The shares  advanced  4.3 percent to $26.27 in  New York , the
highest closing price since March 21. The Mississauga, Canada-
based company has gained 17 percent this year.  Imax, which operates 731 theaters in 53 countries, is
benefiting from growing consumer demand for movies such as the
James Bond thriller “Skyfall” in its large-screen format.
Foreign productions helped lift international sales to 51
percent of the company’s total box-office sales in the quarter,
Chief Executive Officer  Rich Gelfond  said in an interview.  “What we’re trying to do is approach the international
market on a country-by-country basis and using local content,”
Gelfond said in a phone interview today, after the company
released its results.  Net income for the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $12.9 million,
or 19 cents a share, compared with $6.3 million, or 9 cents, a
year earlier, according to a statement today.  Profit excluding some items was 23 cents a share, topping
the average analyst estimate of 16 cents, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 17 percent to $77.8 million
from $66.7 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
