The U.S. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau is seeking public input on possible policies
to ease repayment of student loans, the agency said in an e-
mailed statement.  “Too many private student-loan borrowers are struggling
with unwieldy debt that prevents them from climbing the economic
ladder,” said Richard Cordray, the CFPB’s director, said in an
e-mail. “We will be analyzing plans for policy makers to
consider that might help avoid a repeat of the mortgage meltdown
for today’s student-loan borrowers.”  The CFPB is asking for input on how student loans might
affect the broader economy and impede access to other forms of
credit. It also wants to collect more information on how
struggling borrowers manage their loan repayments, options for
lowering monthly payments and examples of repayment plans in
other markets that might work for student loans.  In a July  report  to Congress, the CFPB and Education
Department said that “too many student loan borrowers are
struggling to pay off private student loans that they did not
understand and cannot afford.” Aggregate private student-loan
debt amounted to about $150 billion at the time, representing 15
percent of total education debt, the report said.  About 30 lenders issue private loans. Among the
largest are  SLM Corp. (SLM) , better known as Sallie Mae;  Wells Fargo &
Co. (WFC) ; and  Discover Financial Services (DFS) , according to the
Washington-based Consumer Bankers Association.  Public comments are due by April 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
