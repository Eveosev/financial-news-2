PCCW Ltd. (8) , which controls Hong
Kong’s biggest telecommunications operator, applied to the
city’s  High Court  for a judicial review to challenge the
regulator’s handling of phone unlocking.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone 5 is blocked from connecting to the
fourth-generation wireless networks of PCCW and  China Mobile
Ltd. (941) , while the smartphone can connect to rivals’ 4G high-speed
networks, Hong Kong-based PCCW said in court documents obtained
by Bloomberg News and dated Feb. 20.  PCCW asked the regulator to investigate the locking of the
smartphone, which restricts subscribers through SIM cards
programmed to work with particular carrier networks, according
to the documents.  The regulator had taken too long to conduct the probe and
had therefore failed in its statutory duty to take action, PCCW
said in the court filings.  Kitty Potter, a Beijing-based Apple spokeswoman, declined
to comment on PCCW’s claims.  PCCW  shares  fell 0.6 percent to HK$3.62 as of the midday
trading break in Hong Kong. They have gained 32 percent in the
past year, compared with a 6 percent advance in the benchmark
 Hang Seng Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
