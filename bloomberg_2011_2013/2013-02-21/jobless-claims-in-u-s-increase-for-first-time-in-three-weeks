Applications for unemployment
benefits in the U.S. rose for the first time in three weeks,
returning to levels seen prior to the holiday period and
indicating little change in the pace of firings.  Jobless claims increased by 20,000 to 362,000 in the week
ended Feb. 16, the Labor Department reported today in
 Washington . The  median  forecast of 48 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for an increase to 355,000. The number of
applications in three states and the  District of Columbia  was
estimated because of the holiday-shortened week, a Labor
Department spokesman said as the data was released.  Companies are maintaining their staffing levels even amid
concern that rising gasoline prices and a January tax increase
will damp  consumer spending . Looming cuts in  government spending 
also threaten to slow growth, a sign that hiring may be limited
in coming months.  “It’s a stable level of claims,” said Yelena Shulyatyeva,
an economist at BNP Paribas in  New York , which predicted claims
would rise to 365,000. “The main issue is the pace of hiring is
not picking up. Businesses feel very uncertain about the
outlook.”  The cost of living was little changed in January for a
second month as a drop in energy costs offset gains in clothing,
hotel rates and airline fares, another report from the Labor
Department showed today. Over the past 12 months, the consumer-
 price index  increased 1.6 percent, the smallest year-over-year
gain since July.  Core Measure  The so-called core measure, which excludes more volatile
food and energy costs, increased 0.3 percent, more than
forecast.  Other data today showed sales of previously owned homes and
an index of leading economic indicators both increased in
January, while a gauge of manufacturing in the Philadelphia
region declined in February.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index March declined 0.4 percent
to 1,505.27 at 10:44 a.m. in New York. The yield on the 10-year
Treasury note slid to 1.97 percent from 2.01 percent.  Economists’ estimates for jobless claims in the Bloomberg
survey ranged from 330,000 to 375,000. The Labor Department
revised the previous week’s figure up to 342,000 from a
previously reported 341,000.  Officials in California and  Virginia  submitted estimates
for their claims last week because they didn’t have time to
compile all the numbers as a result of the Presidents Day
holiday on Feb. 18. The Labor Department submitted estimates on
behalf of  Hawaii  and the nation’s capital.  Less Volatile  The less-volatile  four-week  average climbed to 360,750 from
352,750. The average at the end of October, before the typical
swings related to the year-end holidays set in, was 367,250.  Last week corresponded to the period the Labor Department
will survey businesses to calculate the payroll data for
February. The average last week was little changed from
January’s 360,000 for the comparable period.  The number of people  continuing  to receive jobless benefits
rose by 11,000 to 3.15 million in the week ended Feb. 9. The
continuing claims figure doesn’t include Americans receiving
extended  unemployment benefits  under federal programs.  Those people collecting emergency and extended payments
plunged by about 233,000 to 1.85 million in the week ended Feb.
2.  The  unemployment rate  among Americans eligible for benefits
held at 2.4 percent in the week ended Feb. 9, today’s report
showed.  State Figures  Eleven states and territories reported an increase in
claims, while 42 reported a decrease. These data are reported
with a one-week lag.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth, measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report, accelerates.  Bob Evans Farms Inc. implemented a hiring freeze in May and
is feeling the effects of higher taxes and gas prices. The
Columbus, Ohio-based chain is rehabbing its family restaurants,
expanding takeout service and hawking its low-cost meals to
boost business.  “There’s not much we can do about the economy,” Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer  Steve Davis  said on a Feb. 20
earnings call. “Even though we saw some hiccups, we’re still
encouraged on what we’re able to control.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
