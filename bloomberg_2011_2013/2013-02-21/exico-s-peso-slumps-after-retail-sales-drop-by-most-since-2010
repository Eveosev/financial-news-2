Mexico ’s peso fell after a report
showed that retail sales fell in December by the most in three
years, damping the growth outlook in Latin America’s second-
biggest economy.  The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 12.7671 per  U.S. dollar  at
8:43 a.m. in Mexico City, paring its advance this year to 0.7
percent.  The national statistics agency said today that Mexico’s
retail sales fell 1.8 percent in the final month of 2012 from
the year-earlier period, the biggest annual drop since the
country was emerging from recession in January 2010. Today’s
slump follows a 0.8 percent slide yesterday, when Federal
Reserve minutes indicated a debate over further U.S. stimulus
dimmed the outlook for growth in the biggest market for Mexican
exports.  “Disappointing retail sales have boosted the Mexico peso’s
negative trend started by the Fed minutes,”  Eduardo Suarez , a
Latin America foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of  Nova
Scotia , said in an e-mailed response to questions from Toronto.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.09 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price increased
0.16 centavo to 143.57 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
