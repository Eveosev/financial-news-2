Primary dealers expected the Federal
Reserve to reduce the pace of asset purchases by the beginning
of 2014, with a majority anticipating an end to mortgage-bond
purchases by January, a survey showed.  The median respondent in the survey by the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York saw the central bank buying $20 billion in
Treasuries per month and no mortgage securities in January 2014,
according to the survey conducted before the Federal Open Market
Committee’s Jan. 29-30 meeting.  Fed officials last month affirmed their plan to keep buying
$45 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage bonds per
month, seeking to foster a faster recovery in the  labor market .
Several participants said the FOMC should be prepared to adjust
the pace of purchases, according to minutes of the gathering
released yesterday.  Bond dealers expected the Fed to keep buying the securities
at the same pace through at least the April 30-May 1 meeting
this year, and the median respondent said the first quarter of
2014 is the most likely time for the Fed’s round of large-scale
asset purchases to end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
