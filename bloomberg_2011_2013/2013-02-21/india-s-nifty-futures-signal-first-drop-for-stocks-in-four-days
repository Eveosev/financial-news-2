Indian (SENSEX)  stocks fell the most since
July, with the benchmark index erasing the year’s advance, as
global equities slid amid concern the Federal Reserve may scale
back U.S. economic stimulus and  China  called for property curbs.  The S&P BSE Sensex index slumped 1.6 percent to 19,325.36,
the most since July 23.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the
world’s largest refining complex, lost 1.8 percent. Metalmakers
 Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP) ,  Tata Steel (TATA)  Ltd., Sterlite Industries
(India) Ltd. and Hindalco Industries Ltd. were among the  worst
performers  on the gauge.  The MSCI All-Country World Index of stocks lost 1 percent
at 9:45 a.m. in  London  and the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of
24 raw materials slid to a one-month low after China called for
property curbs and as Federal Reserve minutes showed divisions
over monetary stimulus. A global “risk-off” may reverse the
record foreign fund flows into Indian equities, Morgan Stanley
said in a report dated yesterday.  “Overseas exchange-traded funds are selling commodities,
leading to a collateral damage for  emerging markets  equities,
including India,” Deven Choksey, managing director at K.R.
Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt. in Mumbai, said by telephone.
“FII flows are linked with the U.S. stimulus. A withdrawal may
cause the flows to slow.”  Overseas funds, who net sold local equities for the first
time this year on Feb. 19, have bought a total of $8 billion of
stocks this year, a record for the period, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. They bought a net $24.5 billion in 2012, the
most among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. The Sensex had
its biggest annual gain in three years last year.  ‘Warning Sign’  Foreign buying during the past 12 months as percentage of
India’s stock market value has crossed 2 percent, a “warning
sign” historically, Morgan Stanley said. Credit Suisse Group AG
said Feb. 4 Indian equities were the “most overbought” by
foreigners at 1.7 percent of the market capitalization.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the third-biggest lender by value, sank
3.7 percent to 1,079.60 rupees, the lowest price since Nov. 27.
Reliance, the second-biggest company in the Sensex, lost 1.8
percent to 859.2 rupees.  Tata Steel and Jindal Steel & Power slumped 4 percent each
to 363.9 rupees and 355.3 rupees. Aluminum maker Hindalco slid
3.4 percent to 107.8 rupees. The  S&P BSE Metal index  sank 3.2
percent, the most among the 13 BSE sectoral indexes.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the nation’s biggest engineering
company, dropped 2.2 percent to 1,425.85 rupees, the lowest
close since Sept. 13.  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , the biggest cigarette maker,
lost 1.1 percent to 296.60 rupees, the lowest since Jan. 23.  Workers Strike  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  dropped 2.7 percent to 1,467.5
rupees while  Hero MotoCorp Ltd. (HMCL)  dropped 0.4 percent to 1,688.4
rupees. The companies closed factories as workers continued a
strike against government’s economic reforms for a second day.  The Sensex has lost 3.9 percent from a two-year high set on
Jan. 25 as profits at 43 percent of its 30 members trailed
estimates in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with 40
percent in the previous two quarters, Bloomberg data show.  “Earnings were a non-event as margin performance was a bit
disappointing,” Brahmaprakash Singh, chief investment officer
of equity at Pramerica Asset Managers, told Bloomberg TV India.
“The capital-intensive sector disappointed more and top-lines
of companies that reported good numbers were under pressure.”  The Sensex trades at 13.7 times  projected 12-month profits ,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index’s 10.2 times.  The CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index of the National Stock Exchange dropped
1.5 percent to 5,852.25, the most since July 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
