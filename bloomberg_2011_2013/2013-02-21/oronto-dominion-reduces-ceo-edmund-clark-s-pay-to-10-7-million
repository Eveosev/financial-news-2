Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,  Canada ’s
second-largest lender, awarded Chief Executive Officer Edmund Clark C$10.9 million ($10.7 million) in 2012, a 4.4 percent
decrease from a year earlier.  Clark, 65, was given C$1.5 million in salary, C$5.03
million in share-based awards, C$1.73 million in non-equity
incentive plans and C$134,192 in other compensation, the
Toronto-based bank said today in a filing with Canadian
regulators. Clark’s total compensation last year was C$11.4
million.  The Toronto-based bank cited the impact of litigation
reserves and “the year-over-year decrease in the business
performance factor for members of the senior executive team” in
the filing. Toronto-Dominion had record adjusted profit of C$7.1
billion in the year ended Oct. 31.  Clark told investors in March that he’s in his “final
years” leading the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
