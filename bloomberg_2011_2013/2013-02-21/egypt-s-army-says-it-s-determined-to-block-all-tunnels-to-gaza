Egypt’s army said it is determined
to block all tunnels between the Gaza Strip and the  Sinai
peninsula  to eliminate “terrorist hotbeds.”  “We are aware of the sufferings of the Palestinians but
this does not mean that the Egyptian army would allow any person
to infringe upon our national security or territorial
integrity,” army spokesman Ahmed Ali said on the official Egypt
State Information Service website today.  Attacks against Egyptian military and police targets in
North Sinai have surged over the last few months, including 15
bombings of the  gas pipeline  to Israel. Egyptian authorities
last week began flooding some of the tunnels that stretch into
the Gaza Strip.  The army said today it rejects claims by Hamas officials
that the closure of the border tunnels amounts to “a siege of
 Gaza strip .” It said that “Egypt and the Armed Forces have
always supported the Palestinian cause.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
