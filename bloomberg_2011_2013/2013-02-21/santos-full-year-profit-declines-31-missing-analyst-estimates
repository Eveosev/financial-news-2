Santos Ltd. (STO) , Australia’s third-
biggest oil and gas producer, said full-year profit dropped 31
percent from the previous year after one-time gains weren’t
repeated.  Net income fell to A$519 million in 2012 from A$753 million
a year earlier, the Adelaide-based company said today in a
statement. That compared with the A$589 million average estimate
of 12 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding one-time items,
profit rose 34 percent to A$606 million, according to the
statement.  Santos is building the $18.5 billion Gladstone liquefied
natural gas project in Queensland state, one of seven being
developed in the country to meet Asian demand. Its operations
include the A$490 million Fletcher-Finucane oil project in the
Carnarvon Basin off Western Australia, the Chim Sao oil field in
 Vietnam  and assets in central Australia’s  Cooper Basin .  To contact the reporter on this story:
