Jet fuel weakened on the U.S.  Gulf
Coast  as the region’s inventories rose to the highest level in
three months.  Stockpiles of the  aviation fuel  on the Gulf Coast, known as
PADD 3, increased  491,000 barrels  to 13.5 million in the week
ended Feb. 15, the Energy Information Administration reported
today. That’s the  highest level  since Nov. 9 and the first
advance in three weeks.  Jet 54 fell 0.25 cent to trade at a premium of 8 cents a
gallon versus heating oil futures on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 2 p.m. after reaching the highest level since Sept.
4 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Gulf
Coast was 2.5 cents  below  jet fuel in  New York .  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the Gulf retreated 0.38
cent to 4.13 cents a gallon below futures, while ultra-low-
sulfur diesel dropped 0.13 cent to a premium of 7 cents.  The  3-2-1 crack  spread on the Gulf Coast, a measure of
refining profitability based on West Texas Intermediate in
Cushing, Oklahoma, slipped 14 cents to $35.20 a barrel. The same
spread based on Light Louisiana Sweet oil declined 64 cents to
$12.45 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
