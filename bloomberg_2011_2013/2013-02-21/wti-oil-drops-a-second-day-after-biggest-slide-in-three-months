West Texas Intermediate crude
plunged a second day to its lowest in more than a month,
extending its biggest tumble since November. U.S. crude
stockpiles rose to their highest level since December, according
to the  American Petroleum Institute .  Futures fell as much as 1.8 percent to their lowest since
Jan. 16. U.S. crude inventories gained 2.96 million barrels last
week to 372 million, API data showed yesterday. The  Federal
Reserve  signaled it may consider slowing the pace of asset
purchases, according to minutes of the Jan. 29-30 meeting.
Western governments will revise their offer to  Iran  at talks on
the country’s nuclear work next week, according to France’s
Foreign Ministry.  “The much-needed correction has taken some steam off the
overbought market,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , a commodities
analyst at VTB Capital in London, who forecast last week that
 oil prices  would drop. “Short-term fundamentals simply do not
justify sustained gains.”  WTI for April delivery slid as much as $1.70 to $93.52 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the lowest since Jan. 16, and was at $93.83 at 1:11
p.m. London time. The March contract expired 2.3 percent lower
at $94.46 yesterday, the steepest slump since Nov. 20. The
volume of all futures traded is 88 percent above the 100-day
average.  Brent for April settlement tumbled as much as $1.91 to
$113.69 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, the lowest since Jan. 29. Volume was more than 70
percent more than the 100-day average. The European benchmark
grade was at a premium of $20.27 to WTI futures, compared with
$20.38 yesterday. The gap expanded to $23.18 on Feb. 8, the
widest since Nov. 26.  Fuel Stockpiles  Oil is extending losses in  New York  after breaching
technical support yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Futures settled below $95 a barrel, the trough
between a “double-top” that formed after advances stalled near
$98 on Jan. 31 and Feb. 13. The price gap is about $3, signaling
crude may fall to around $92 in a so-called reversal. Losses
tend to accelerate when chart support fails.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report at 11 a.m. in  Washington , a day later than usual because
of the Presidents Day holiday on Feb. 18. It will probably show
that U.S. crude supplies rose by 2 million barrels last week,
while gasoline stockpiles declined  900,000 barrels  a Bloomberg
survey indicated.  Iran Talks  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  slid by 122,000 barrels last week
to 232.6 million barrels, the API’s data showed. Crude supplies
at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for futures traded on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , increased 546,000 barrels to
50.8 million, according to the API.              Distillate inventories, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel,  dropped by 1.64 million  barrels to 126 million
barrels. The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary
basis from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and
pipelines. The government requires that reports be filed with
the Energy Department for its weekly survey.  Stalled multilateral negotiations on Iran’s nuclear work
are scheduled to resume in  Kazakhstan  on Feb. 26. The last round
of talks between Iran and world powers, held in Moscow in June,
failed to yield results.  “We will make an updated offer that will contain new
substantive elements,” the French Foreign Ministry said in an
e-mail. “The approach remains that of  Baghdad , that is a
gradual approach that commences with confidence measures.”  Iraq’s crude oil exports rose in January for the first time
since October, according to the marketing unit of the OPEC
member state’s Oil Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
