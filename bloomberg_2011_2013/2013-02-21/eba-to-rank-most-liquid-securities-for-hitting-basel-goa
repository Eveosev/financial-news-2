Europe ’s top banking regulator will
start ranking financial assets in order of liquidity as it
implements international rules to protect banks from a sudden
loss of short-term funding.  The  European Banking Authority  will create a “scorecard”
of asset liquidity, the agency said in an e-mailed statement, as
part of requirements that banks hold a buffer of assets, known
as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, they can quickly sell to
survive a 30-day credit squeeze.  The EBA’s analysis will also “identify the features that
are of particular importance to market liquidity” and report to
the European Union’s executive body, the regulator said.  Central bankers from around the world, who make up the
 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , agreed on Jan. 6 to give
banks more time and the right to use more types of securities to
meet the liquidity ratio. The LCR is part of an overhaul of
global financial rules, known as Basel III, intended to prevent
a repeat of the financial crisis that followed the 2008 collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Ireland, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, is
pressing for an agreement to have the rule take full effect on
Jan. 1, 2018, a year ahead of a deadline set last month by the
global central bank chiefs. Global regulators had previously
planned to implement the requirement fully from 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
